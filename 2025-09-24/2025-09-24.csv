            Federal investigators seized multiple documents labeled “secret,” “confidential,” and “classified,” including some about weapons of mass destruction, during the late August search of the office of President Donald Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton, according to newly released court records that are part of an investigation into whether Bolton mishandled defense records.
    


            The new details provide additional insight into what evidence federal investigators have collected as they look at possible criminal charges for Bolton, who became a political antagonist of Trump's after he published a book in summer 2020 about how the president bungled several interactions with and about foreign governments.
    


            A manuscript Bolton wrote for the book, titled “The Room Where It Happened,” initially contained classified details, federal officials told Bolton at the time, but he hasn't been charged with any crime.
    


            During the recent search of Bolton's office, agents found a binder about a State Department security briefing for the 2000-2001 administration transition, plus documents about a communications plan, the US Mission to the United Nations, travel and weapons of mass destruction, according to an inventory list that was filed in court and obtained by media outlets this week. CNN and other news organizations had sued for access to the records about the search.
    


            The inventory list written by FBI agents specifically said the property removed from Bolton's Washington, DC, office on August 22 included: “Travel memo documents with pages labeled secret”; “US Mission to the United Nations - Confidential Documents”; “U.S. Government Strategic Communications Plan - Confidential Documents”; and “Confidential Documents with (redacted) heading Weapons of Mass Destruction Classified Documents.”
    


            Confidential and Secret are both levels of classification for national security information.
    


            The federal agents also took four computers and a USB flash drive from Bolton's office, according to the records.
    


            According to a person familiar with Bolton's office, the paper documents Bolton had there were not from the Trump administration. Instead, they may have been 20 years old or older – from his earlier tenures in the federal government when he was an under secretary at the State Department and the United Nations ambassador during the second Bush administration.
    


            The age of the documents may be important, given that it's possible they had been declassified by the federal government over the years, the person said, speaking anonymously because the investigation is ongoing. Bolton, 76, has maintained a private office since 2014 for political and policy work, according to public filings.
    


            Bolton's lawyer Abbe Lowell has repeatedly said in recent public statements responding to the investigative activity that the records Bolton had would have been typical of those kept by a long-time government official.
    


            “The documents with classification markings from the period 1998 - 2006 date back to Amb. Bolton's time in the George W. Bush Administration,” Lowell said in a statement on Wednesday. “An objective and thorough review will show nothing inappropriate was stored or kept by Ambassador Bolton.”
    


            Yet the Justice Department confirmed in court filings this week the sensitive grand jury investigation is ongoing. The documents say investigators are looking at possible violations of criminal statutes that prohibit the unauthorized retention of classified records and improper handling of national defense material.
    


            Court proceedings prompted by media outlets, including CNN, previously made public other records about the investigation around Bolton and the search of his home, which occurred on the same day that federal authorities searched his office.
    


            The agents at the house had removed several phones, computers and drives, a binder labeled “statements and reflections to allied strikes …” and folders of documents labeled “Trump I-IV,” those court records said.
    


            Federal investigators said they had reason to believe they would find classified records in the search of his house in Bethesda, Maryland.
    


            His interactions with a classification expert in the federal government to remove classified details from his book manuscript in 2020 were part of the FBI's reasoning for the search, as was a foreign adversary's hack of his AOL account. CNN previously reported that the US intelligence community believes Bolton's emails may have been intercepted by China, Russia or Iran.

            Latest Market News 





            Hot Stocks 





            When Jimmy Kimmel taped his back-to-work monologue Tuesday night, he predicted that the restoration of his show would “unfortunately and unjustly” put ABC at risk of additional pressure from the government.
    


            One hour before the monologue aired, President Trump proved him right, posting a blustery new legal threat against ABC on Truth Social.
    


            Trump's message swerved between dismissive — Kimmel's “audience is GONE,” he claimed — and intimidating. He claimed Kimmel “puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE. He is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do.”
    


            ABC has not responded to CNN's request for comment about Trump's post, which lacked any clear legal basis.
    


            This latest legal threat may come and go, but it is another crystal-clear example of the president using his government power to cajole a privately owned media company into changing its content.
    


            In this case, it's for a very specific reason: The president can't stand being criticized night after night.
    


            As Kimmel noted on the air, the president has also called for NBC to fire Jimmy Fallon. Kimmel urged viewers to speak up on Fallon's behalf if there is “any hint” of action against his rival.
    


            On Wednesday morning, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer reacted to Trump's newest missive against ABC by saying, “This is a test of democracy.”
    


            That threat, Schumer said on MSNBC, “is what dictatorships do. That is what autocracies do.”
    


            Trump wants anyone he “doesn't agree with he wants to shut up,” Schumer added. “That's a dagger to the heart of America.”
    


            Trump's post also highlighted how last December's Disney settlement has emboldened him to make further demands of media companies. “Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars,” the president wrote. “This one sounds even more lucrative.”
    


            The president's tone is revealing. “They gave me” $16 million sounds so casual, when in fact ABC's payout was anything but.
    


            The company decided to settle Trump's defamation lawsuit against ABC News to avoid the legal discovery process and an unpredictable trial, not out of the goodness of Mickey Mouse's heart. Numerous critics, including some inside ABC, now look back at that settlement with regret, believing it kicked off a wave of media capitulation to the president.
    


            In any case, Trump's latest threat is a clear indication that he intends to punish ABC for allowing Kimmel to return to the air.
    


            It also once again contradicts the popular MAGA media claim that Trump and Brendan Carr had nothing to do with Kimmel's benching. As Justin Amash, the former GOP congressman, said on X, the president's words “torpedoed every White House surrogate who claimed the administration wasn't attempting to coerce Disney/ABC.”
    


            Kimmel geared up his audience for this continued grudge match last night. He assailed Trump's “un-American” attacks on free speech and borrowed a line from the late great comedian Jack Paar, the second host of “The Tonight Show,” who quit hosting the show for nearly a month in 1960 over a dispute with NBC's censors. When Paar returned to work, he opened by saying, “As I was saying before I was interrupted…”
    


            And that's exactly how Kimmel opened last night, as well.
    


            “By borrowing Paar's comeback, Kimmel placed his own suspension in the lineage of late-night defiance,” late-night TV analyst Jed Rosenzweig wrote in a column for his website LateNighter. It was a calculated echo of late-night history by Kimmel: “Rather than treating his absence as punishment, he reframed it as an interruption — a pause in the conversation with his audience that he now controls again.”
    


            Much to Trump's chagrin, Kimmel got the last laugh — for now.

            Hundreds of federal employees who lost their jobs in Elon Musk's cost-cutting blitz are being asked to return to work.
    


            The General Services Administration has given the employees — who managed government workspaces — until the end of the week to accept or decline reinstatement, according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press.
    


            Those who accept must report for duty on October 6 after what amounts to a seven-month paid vacation, during which time the GSA in some cases racked up high costs — passed along to taxpayers — to stay in dozens of properties whose leases it had slated for termination or were allowed to expire.
    


            “Ultimately, the outcome was the agency was left broken and understaffed,” said Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official. “They didn't have the people they needed to carry out basic functions.”
    


            Becker, who represents owners with government leases at Arco Real Estate Solutions, said GSA has been in a “triage mode” for months. He said the sudden reversal of the downsizing reflects how Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency had gone too far, too fast.
    


            GSA was established in the 1940s to centralize the acquisition and management of thousands of federal workplaces. Its return to work request mirrors rehiring efforts at in several agencies targeted by DOGE. Last month, the IRS said it would allow some employees who took a resignation offer to remain on the job. The Labor Department has also brought back some employees who took buyouts, while the National Park Service earlier reinstated a number of purged employees.
    


            Critical to the work of such agencies is the GSA, which manages many of the buildings. Starting in March, thousands of GSA employees left the agency as part of programs that encouraged them to resign or take early retirement. Hundreds of others — those subject to the recall notice — were dismissed as part of an aggressive push to reduce the size of the federal workforce. Though those employees did not show up for work, some continue to get paid.
    


            GSA representatives didn't respond to detailed questions about the return-to-work notice, which the agency issued Friday. They also declined to discuss the agency's headcount, staffing decisions or the potential cost overruns generated by reversing its plans to terminate leases.
    


            “GSA's leadership team has reviewed workforce actions and is making adjustments in the best interest of the customer agencies we serve and the American taxpayers,” an agency spokesman said in an email.
    


            Democrats have assailed the Trump administration's indiscriminate approach to slashing costs and jobs. Rep. Greg Stanton of Arizona, the top Democrat on the subcommittee overseeing the GSA, told AP there is no evidence that reductions at the agency “delivered any savings.”
    


We do not know what exactly Elon Musk is doing to the federal government



            “It's created costly confusion while undermining the very services taxpayers depend on,” he said.
    


            DOGE identified the agency, which had about 12,000 employees at the start of the Trump administration, as a chief target of its campaign to reduce fraud, waste and abuse in the federal government.
    


            A small cohort of Musk's trusted aides embedded in GSA's headquarters, sometimes sleeping on cots on the agency's sixth floor, and pursued plans to abruptly cancel nearly half of the 7,500 leases in the federal portfolio. DOGE also wanted GSA to sell hundreds of federally owned buildings with the goal of generating billions in savings.
    


            GSA started by sending more than 800 lease cancellation notices to landlords, in many cases without informing the government tenants. The agency also published a list of hundreds of government buildings that were targeted for sale.
    


            Pushback to GSA's dumping of its portfolio was swift, and both initiatives have been dialed back. More than 480 leases slated for termination by DOGE have since been spared. Those leases were for offices scattered around the country that are occupied by such agencies as the IRS, Social Security Administration and Food and Drug Administration.
    


            DOGE's “Wall of Receipts,” which once boasted that the lease cancellations alone would save nearly $460 million, has since reduced that estimate to $140 million by the end of July, according to Becker, the former GSA real estate official.
    


Tracking Trump's overhaul of the federal workforce



            Meanwhile, GSA embarked on massive job cuts. The administration slashed GSA's headquarters staff by 79%, its portfolio managers by 65% and facilities managers by 35%, according to a federal official briefed on the situation. The official, who was not authorized to speak to the media, provided the statistics on condition of anonymity.
    


            As a result of the internal turmoil, 131 leases expired without the government actually vacating the properties, the official said. The situation has exposed the agencies to steep fees because property owners have not been able to rent out those spaces to other tenants.
    


            The public may soon get a clearer picture of what transpired at the agency.
    


            The Government Accountability Office, an independent congressional watchdog, is examining the GSA's management of its workforce, lease terminations and planned building disposals and expects to issue findings in the coming months, said David Marroni, a senior GAO official.

 Hungary will continue importing Russian oil and gas, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has said, rejecting pressure from Washington and Brussels for a clean break from Moscow's energy supplies.

Szijjarto made the comments in an interview with The Guardian published on Tuesday on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. For landlocked Hungary, he said, the issue of energy security is a matter of physical infrastructure – pipelines, refineries and existing contracts – that limit where it can source energy.

“We can't ensure the safe supply for our country without Russian oil or gas sources,” he said. “It can be nice to dream about buying oil and gas from somewhere else … but we can only buy from where we have infrastructure.”

In recent weeks, the US has increasingly pushed its European NATO partners to stop purchasing Russian energy and to introduce secondary tariffs on India and China, while refusing to impose any new sanctions unilaterally. President Donald Trump mocked them in his UNGA address on Tuesday, claiming “some in NATO are funding the war against themselves.”

Hungary's state-owned MOL Group imports about five million tonnes of crude annually via the Druzhba pipeline, which also supplies Slovakia. The route has come under direct threat in recent months, with Ukrainian forces striking pumping stations and other facilities along the line, causing temporary disruptions to shipments.

The European Commission has set a goal of phasing out Russian fossil fuels by 2027. Brussels has reportedly included 12 Chinese and three Indian entities in its 19th sanctions package, which must be unanimously approved before being adopted.

Brussels has also been weighing separate trade measures that could curtail oil deliveries through the Druzhba pipeline, even without unanimous consent, effectively allowing other EU members to outvote Hungary and Slovakia, according to Bloomberg. 

When asked about mounting European pressure, Szijjarto said it was “totally impossible to carry out a fact-based, rational dialogue based on common sense” with Western officials, whom he described as “fanatics.”

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, one of Trump's closest allies in Europe, has argued that continuing Russian supplies is essential to protect households and industry. He has maintained relations with Russia and often criticized Western military support for Ukraine, even as most EU states have cut ties since 2022.

A shooting at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas on Wednesday has left at least one person dead and several others injured from possible sniper fire, the Dallas Police Department has announced. The suspected shooter also died at the scene, according to police.

US Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin has told Fox News there were “three fatalities, potentially detainees,” in the shooting.

One of the victims and the suspected shooter died at the scene while two others were sent to hospital with gunshot wounds, the police statement added. ICE agents were also injured in the attack, according to reports.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the suspect was apparently killed by a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

“While we don't know the motive yet, we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them. It must stop,” Noem said on X.

The attack reportedly occurred as ICE officers were transferring detainees into the facility.

The I-35E highway, next to which the site is located, was closed in both directions, according to the media. The FBI is responding to the incident.

ICE has been the target of significant backlash in the US, particularly from the left, over its enforcement of the government policy of mass deportation of individuals believed to be illegal immigrants.

Critics say President Donald Trump's administration is denying targeted people due process and otherwise violating human rights.

The political climate in the US has become increasingly charged. Earlier this month, conservative speaker Charlie Kirk was murdered by a sniper in what was broadly perceived as a significant turning point. Trump has accused the “radical left” of fanning tensions.

Vice President J.D. Vance said, “The obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.” Meanwhile, Attorney General Ken Paxton said he was praying for the victims of “this heinous shooting” and vowed to act against “twisted individuals” targeting law enforcement.

A growing number of Poles believe Ukraine should give up claims to regions that voted to join Russia in referendums, in order to reach a peace settlement, according to a new survey.

A United Surveys poll for Wirtualna Polska published on Tuesday found that almost 42% of respondents believe Ukraine should drop its territorial claims for security guarantees and peace. Of the 1,000 Polish adults of voting age surveyed in late-August, 48% were against giving up land claims for peace, with 10% undecided.A survey published only last month by Rzeczpospolita found 37.4% supported concessions, while 50.5% opposed them.

Moscow has long insisted that Kiev recognize Crimea, Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, and Zaporozhye as Russian territory in any peace deal. Kiev has rejected this, with Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky vowing last month to retake Crimea – largely populated by ethnic Russians – which voted to join Russia after the 2014 Western-backed coup in Kiev. He also pledged to reclaim the four other regions, which joined Russia in 2022, saying “it's only a matter of time.”

Poland has been one of Ukraine's top donors since 2022, providing over €5.1 billion ($5.7 billion) in aid – more than 70% of it as weapons – according to Germany's Kiel Institute. Warsaw is also part of the “coalition of the willing,” advocating continued military aid.

However, support for Kiev among Polish citizens has been steadily declining. Backing for Ukraine's EU membership dropped to 35% and NATO membership to 37% in June this year, down from 85% and 75% respectively in February 2022, according to a recent IBRiS survey. Prime Minister Donald Tusk admitted to “a growing wave of pro-Russian sentiment and antipathy towards a struggling Ukraine” in a post on X earlier this month.

On Sunday, an anti-war rally took place in Warsaw, with demonstrators waving national flags and carrying placards denouncing Poland's involvement in the conflict and military aid for Kiev. Videos and photos posted on social media showed banners reading “Poland is for peace” and “We say no to warmongers.”

Moscow has repeatedly warned that foreign aid only prolongs the conflict and urged a diplomatic solution. It insists any settlement must include Ukrainian neutrality, demilitarization, and recognition of the current territorial reality – including the status of its new regions.

Texas Ice facility shooting – latest updates

Two people have been killed and another was injured in a shooting at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) field office in Dallas on Wednesday morning, officials said.

Authorities added that the shooter died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The Dallas police department said that officers responded to a call at approximately 6.40am on Wednesday.

“The preliminary investigation determined that a suspect opened fire at a government building from an adjacent building,” the police said in a statement. “Two people were transported to the hospital with gunshot wounds. One victim died at the scene. The suspect is deceased.”

In a later statement, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that two of the victims are now deceased, and the other is in critical condition.

“The shooter fired indiscriminately at the ICE building, including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot. Three detainees were shot,” they said.

At a news conference on Wednesday morning, Joe Rothrock, the head of the FBI field office in Dallas, said that “rounds that were found near the suspected shooter contain messages that are anti-Ice in nature”.

One of the unspent shell casings recovered was engraved with the phrase “ANTI ICE”, according to a post from the FBI director, Kash Patel.

Authorities said that the FBI is investigating this incident as an act of targeted violence. They said they are not releasing the identities of any of the victims at this time, but confirmed that no members of law enforcement were injured during the attack.

At the conference, the Republican senator Ted Cruz, who represents Texas, said that “politically motivated violence is wrong”, adding that “this is the third shooting in Texas directed at Ice” or Customs and Border Protection.

Parkland hospital in Dallas confirmed to the Associated Press that it had received two patients from the incident at the Ice facility. The hospital spokesperson did not have any details about their conditions.

Kristi Noem, the DHS secretary, confirmed  in a statement that the suspected shooter died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound and said that details about the incident were “still emerging” but confirmed that there were “multiple injuries and fatalities” at the Ice field office.

“While we don't know motive yet, we know that our Ice law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them,” Noem said. “It must stop.”

Law enforcement officials told CNN that at least two of the victims were Ice detainees.

Todd Lyons, the acting Ice director, told the network that the “scene is secure” and said that three people were shot and taken to the hospital.

An Ice spokesperson has also told NBC News that all three people shot were detainees at the facility.

Dan Bongino, the deputy director of the FBI, said that the agency is “fully engaged, in conjunction with our state and federal law enforcement partners, at the crime scene in Dallas”.

JD Vance called the shooting an “obsessive attack on law enforcement” that “must stop”. Though, as noted above, no Ice agents were injured.

“I'm praying for everyone hurt in this attack and for their families,” the vice-president wrote on X.

John Cornyn, another Republican senator who represents Texas, called the shooting “horrific”.

“While law enforcement investigates, I am keeping everyone impacted in my prayers,” he said. “My staff have been in touch with federal & local officials in Dallas, and we will make sure all resources are brought to bear in the investigation.”

Texas's governor, Greg Abbott, said in a statement that “Texas fully supports Ice”.

“This assassination will NOT slow our arrest, detention, & deportation of illegal immigrants,” he said. “We will work with ICE & the Dallas Police Dept. to get to the bottom of the assassin's motive.”

During the news conference on Wednesday, Eric Johnson, the mayor of Dallas, urged residents to “be patient, remain calm, and let our law enforcement partners, and our police department, do their job”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Officials on the Hawaiian island of Maui went door to door evacuating residents from a wildfire on Tuesday and sounded emergency sirens. But evacuation orders were lifted later in the day as the threat from the fire receded.

The fire, which on Tuesday grew to more than 100 acres (40 hectares), was first reported at 1.30pm near the north shore town of Paia, officials said.

Paia is a former sugar plantation town that has become popular with windsurfers. It is on the other side of the island from Lahaina, which was destroyed by a deadly wildfire in 2023.

“Leave immediately!” said one alert from Maui's emergency management agency. “There is a dangerous threat to life and property.”

Firefighters worked throughout Tuesday afternoon and evening to stop the blaze's forward progress, and emergency shelters closed late on Tuesday as residents returned home.

Before the situation improved, residents were fearful of another devastating blaze. Nohelani Uʻu-Hodgins, a Maui county councilwoman, said her family, including her 86-year-old grandmother, had to evacuate from Paia to stay with her.

“It's terrifying,” she said. “We never have to learn the lessons of Lahaina twice; that's never something we need to learn once again. But from my house I'm watching my home town burn.”

Paia resident Rod Antone said he was working in a county building in Wailuku where he listened to radio updates but didn't hear the sirens. In the hours before the wildfire engulfed Lahaina in 2023, Maui county officials failed to activate emergency sirens.

Antone noted that winds didn't feel particularly strong on Tuesday, unlike in August 2023, when wind-whipped flames burned Lahaina and left 102 people dead. But like Lahaina, Paia is surrounded by dry brush, he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Pope names James Checchio to succeed Gregory Aymond two weeks after archdiocese agreed to settle with survivors

Pope Leo XIV on Wednesday named an eventual successor to New Orleans' embattled Catholic archbishop, Gregory Aymond, two weeks after his archdiocese agreed to settle with survivors of clergy sexual abuse for $230m.

Leo, history's first US pope, named bishop James Checchio of Metuchen, New Jersey, as the coadjutor bishop of New Orleans. The role positions Checchio to assist Aymond initially and then succeed him when he retires.

Checchio, 59, handled the fallout in Metuchen of the explosive 2018 sexual misconduct revelations of one of his predecessors there, Theodore McCarrick. Prior to arriving in Metuchen in 2016, Checchio had served as the rector of the US seminary in Rome for a decade.

Aymond reached the mandatory retirement age of 75 last November, suggesting that the Vatican kept him in place to finalize the abuse settlement and allow for an organized handover to his successor.

The New Orleans archdiocese agreed on 8 September to a $230m proposed settlement to end one of the US church's longest and most contentious battles over abuse claims. It had proposed in May to pay at least $179.2m in response to more than 500 abuse claims, but victims' attorneys opposed the deal as too low.

Survivors have until late October to vote on whether or not to approve the revised settlement. If approved by two-thirds of survivors, payments could begin disbursement by next year.

The archdiocese had filed for bankruptcy in May 2020, rather than handle each abuse claim separately, which survivors say allowed church leadership to avoid facing tough questions in court.

The archdiocese's largest insurer, Travelers, for now has held out against a settlement. If it ultimately decides to contribute to a settlement rather than risk facing litigation from individual abuse claimants, the amount of the settlement in the New Orleans archdiocese bankruptcy would ostensibly increase from $230m.

Aymond had resisted calls for his resignation over the church's management of its decades-old clergy abuse scandal, which in New Orleans has thrust the local archdiocese under law enforcement investigation for alleged child sex trafficking.

Media investigations in February revealed that the archdiocese received help from executives of professional American football's New Orleans Saints with respect to softening critical press coverage of the church's management of the clergy-abuse scandal.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has arrived in New York to attend the ongoing U.N. General Assembly, Russian state media reported early on Sept. 24.

World leaders, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, arrived for the week-long annual U.N. summit on Sept. 22. Russian President Vladimir Putin is not in attendance.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to meet Lavrov on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly on Sept. 24, according to Rubio's schedule for the day.

The U.S. has intensified efforts to broker a peace deal to end Russia's war against Ukraine in recent months, with no success. U.S. President Donald Trump met Putin in Alaska on Aug. 15, but has since voiced discontent with the Russian leader for failing to cooperate in efforts to end the war.

Lavrov's flight to New York from Moscow took nearly 12 hours as the aircraft avoided flying over other countries before arriving in the U.S., Russian state media claimed.

Ukraine's allies have barred Russian aircraft from using their airspace. Canada and EU member states have banned Russian planes from flying over their own territory in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Moscow first announced on Sept. 19 that Lavrov is set to meet Rubio on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, with no date set at the time.

Zelensky and Trump met on the sidelines of the global summit on Sept. 23.

The U.S. leader has previously called for Ukraine to make concessions to Russia, but following his meeting with Zelensky, he signaled that Ukraine may be able to return all of its territory as Moscow refuses to cease hostilities.

""After getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia Military and Economic situation and, after seeing the Economic trouble it is causing Russia, I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform afterward.

The same day, Zelensky told reporters that Trump now trusts Kyiv more following dishonesty from Putin.

""Gradually, (Trump) realized that Putin was simply sharing some information that was far from the truth on the battlefield. Now he trusts me much more because the information that my intelligence has, that we share with our partners,"" Zelensky said at a press conference.

Russia's parliament passed a bill in the first reading on Sept. 24 that would introduce year-round conscription, replacing spring and fall draft cycles, pro-government outlet Kommersant reported.

While conscripts are officially barred from being deployed abroad, reports indicate that many are pressured into signing contracts with Russia's Defense Ministry and sent to fight in Ukraine.

The bill would overhaul the existing system by allowing enlistment offices to conduct medical exams, psychological screenings, and draft board sessions throughout the year. 

Under the proposed system, draft notices would be issued year-round.

The reform is meant to ease pressure on military commissariats, according to Andrei Kartapolov, chairman of the parliament's Defense Committee and the bill's author. 

Russia drafts young men twice a year for one year of compulsory service. 

Russian President Vladimir Putin's partial mobilization in 2022, the first since World War II, triggered protests across Russia and a mass exodus of more than 261,000 men. 

Although the Kremlin declared mobilization ""completed,"" it has never been officially ended by a decree.

Since then, Moscow has sought to avoid another large-scale mobilization by ramping up contract recruitment, offering financial incentives to volunteers.

Ukraine carried out strikes on multiple targets in Russia linked to oil refining and drone production, Ukraine's General Staff confirmed on Sept. 24.

The confirmation follows a reported overnight attack on the Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat petrochemical plant in Russia's Republic of Bashkortostan.

The General Staff said the strike hit the oil refining facility in the Republic of Bashkortostan, specifically the ELOU-AVT-6 primary oil refining unit. Preliminary reports indicate the attack caused a fire at the site.

The Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat facility is one of Russia's largest oil refining and petrochemical plants, producing 150 different types of products, including gasoline and diesel fuel. It is located some 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from the front line in Ukraine.

The targeted facility processes up to 10 million tons of oil annually and is a key producer of liquid rocket fuel for Russia, according to the General Staff.

In addition to the strike on the oil refinery in the Republic of Bashkortostan, Ukrainian forces also targeted key infrastructure sites involved in the country's energy and defense sectors.

The Kuzmichi-1 oil pumping station, part of the crude oil transport network supplying Russia's southern regions, was among the facilities hit. Another strike targeted the Zenzevatka pumping station, which services the Kuybyshev-Tikhoretsk main oil pipeline.

Ukrainian forces struck a drone production facility in the village of Valuyki in Russia's Belgorod Oblast as well. While the full extent of the damage is still being assessed, a fire reportedly broke out at the site following the attack.

Ukraine's General Staff also confirmed that a long-range strike on Sept. 22 targeted the Astrakhan gas processing plant in southern Russia, forcing a partial shutdown of operations.

The facility, located in Russia's Astrakhan Oblast, is one of the world's largest gas chemical complexes and the country's primary producer of sulfur used in explosives, accounting for up to 66% of national output. The plant processes up to 3.2 million tons of oil products annually, according to the General Staff.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

Ukrainian forces have intensified attacks on Russia's oil industry over the past year, forcing operational suspensions and exacerbating a nationwide fuel shortage.

Kyiv considers Russian oil refineries, petrochemical facilities, as well as military production sites, to be valid military targets as they help fund Moscow's war machine.

Construction continues at the Lithium Nevada Corp. mine site Tracker Pass project on April 24, 2023, near Orovada, NevRick Bowmer/The Associated Press

U.S.-listed shares of Lithium Americas (LAC-N, LAC-T) jumped over 100 per cent on Wednesday after Reuters reported that the Trump administration is seeking up to a 10 per cent stake in the miner, in the latest sign of Washington's intervention into industries it considers critical to national security.

Late Tuesday, Reuters cited two people familiar with the talks who said the administration is considering the stake as part of negotiations over a US$2.26-billion Department of Energy loan for the company's Thacker Pass lithium project in Nevada, the largest planned lithium mine in the Western Hemisphere.

Vancouver-based Lithium Americas said on Wednesday it was in discussions with the U.S. energy department and General Motors over the Thacker Pass loan.

The move underscores President Donald Trump's increasing use of direct government ownership to steer strategic sectors and curb reliance on China, which dominates refining of many critical minerals.

China produces over 40,000 metric tons of lithium annually, ranking third after Australia and Chile, but dominates refining, processing more than 75 per cent of the world's lithium into battery-grade material.

TD Cowen analysts said a government stake would lend credence to the Thacker Pass project completion and expansion to multiple phases with perhaps enhanced economics.

The project is seen as a linchpin in building a domestic supply chain part of Washington's long-standing drive to boost U.S. production of lithium, a metal used to make batteries for electric vehicles and other electronics.

The Trump administration recently moved to take a stake in chipmaker Intel following a deal that would make the Department of Defense the largest shareholder in rare earths MP Materials. Jefferies said the administration's preference for equity stakes, viewed as lower political cost than tax increases, can support financing, corporate profits, and favorable returns on invested capital.

Lithium Americas' Canadian and U.S.-listed shares were both up about 90 per cent at $8.04 and US$5.80, respectively. The company had a market value of US$744.5-million as of last close on the New York Stock Exchange.

GM, which invested US$625-million in the mine last year for a 38 per cent stake, has the right to buy all of the project's lithium from its first phase and a portion from the second phase for 20 years, although Trump officials are now seeking a guarantee that GM will buy the metal, according to the sources.

NBCFM Research analyst Mohamed Sidibe said the MP Materials-DoD model shows how government equity, long-term offtake, and price support can derisk strategic projects.

He added for Lithium Americas, a similar approach could strengthen funding and project durability, though it may dilute existing shareholders.

The Thacker Pass project is expected to begin production in 2028.

Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein said an equity stake could include offtake price guarantees, potentially making Thacker Pass profitable even if lithium prices remain lower for longer.

The news also lifted other lithium miners in premarket trading. Albemarle gained 5.5 per cent while Sigma Lithium climbed 9 per cent. U.S.-listed shares of SQM rose 3.3 per cent.

Ford vehicles parked for sale at a car dealership in Oakville, Ont.Carlos Osorio/Reuters

Canadian vehicle sales have rebounded to close to pre-pandemic highs, but much of the rest of the outlook for North America's auto industry remains uncertain: Trump tariffs, electric vehicle sales, the future of Canada's auto sector, and prospects both for Detroit's Big Three auto makers and for Tesla. Karwel is director of the customer success data and analytics division for Canada at J.D. Power.

1. First, the good news: Canadian vehicle sales peaked at more than two million units in 2017 and are likely to hit 1.8 million this year. Consumer expenditures were more than $60 billion in 2024, he says, “above anything we have seen between 2017 and 2024.”

2. The average price of a new vehicle climbed past $40,000 early in the pandemic and is approaching $50,000. A sharp rise over the past two years was due to “increased vehicle prices combined with a massive drop in incentives, like low APR financing,” Karwel says. On average, prices are still rising slightly—about 1% to 2% a year. 

3. The impact of the Trump tariffs and Canadian counter-tariffs is still cloudy, Karwel says. Dealers had inventory at the start, and most vehicles already complied with the USMCA free trade agreement. But vehicles were already getting more expensive. “This will certainly not be a smoking gun. It will just add more complexity and pricing,” he says.

4. Consumers are still lukewarm about EVs. Pure EVs are about 4.5% of the Canadian market, and if you add plug-in hybrids, that rises to about 8%. But Ottawa has removed rebates. “When you make a car $5,000 more expensive overnight, that will certainly negatively impact sales,” Karwel says. “The environment surrounding EVs is highly politicized at the moment.”

5. Karwel declines to discuss the financial prospects of the Big Three. Shares of GM, Ford and Stellantis trade below 10 times earnings, while Tesla's P/E ratio is still almost 200. But the possible vanishing of Canada's auto industry is a real fear, he says. “Our domestic market (1.75 million to two million units) is too small to sustain production from multiple original equipment manufacturers.”

A death binder is an instruction manual for a person's life that includes everything from a copy of a will, powers of attorney, financial documents, letter of wishes, funeral arrangements, household information and all forms of identification.oonal/iStockPhoto / Getty Images

After watching friends and family go through the laborious process of managing an estate, more executors are insisting on completed death binders before agreeing to take on the role, say experts in the death planning industry.

“I hear this all the time from executors, … ‘Unless you do the preparation, I will not be your executor,'” says Rosemary Pahl, Calgary-based author of The Departing Details Workbook.

A death binder is an instruction manual for a person's life that includes everything from a copy of the will, powers of attorney, financial documents, letter of wishes, funeral arrangements, household information and all forms of identification. Most clients start working on their death binders after drafting their wills and powers of attorney, experts say. 

As a former intensive care registered nurse, Ms. Pahl witnessed family turmoil firsthand with patients placed in palliative care and their surviving family members struggling with options and finding key documentation.

“They have to make decisions and they don't know what the person wanted,” she says. 

 Ms. Pahl then realized her own family didn't have great clarity on final arrangements either. After retiring, she made it her mission to clean up the family's financial affairs and create a binder. The process took her three years as she kept thinking of more issues to address. She marvelled at how much time it took her to find her own required documents and get professional advice on funeral arrangements, her finances, and to discuss her wishes with her family. 

“Then, I imagined [what if] that was my executor or children trying to find things when I had difficulty myself,” says Ms. Pahl, whose personal death binder project spurred the start of her company. Through word of mouth and a business partnership with an e-commerce entrepreneur, she has sold more than 10,000 of the Departing Details binders worldwide to date. 

More people are using death binders as a way to keep track of the more diverse set of assets people have today, says Tim Hewson, founder and chief executive officer of LegalWills in Toronto.

“If we think about our parents, they had a house, a bank account with a monthly statement sent by mail,” he says. “We have online accounts, revenue from a blog, photos, crypto [and] rewards points. The expectation that an executor could come in and make sense of all of this is inconceivable.”

Mr. Hewson says younger generations are turning to online death binders, where information can be updated more easily. With paper-only copies, many are left to wonder if they're reading the most up-to-date information.

His company's death binder, called LifeLocker, is a service offered to those who draft a will through LegalWills. He says LifeLocker is encrypted in the cloud. The client creates a digital keyholder (executor) who can access the information upon the client's passing.

“Then, we have safeguards to make sure the keyholder doesn't access it prematurely or someone who isn't your keyholder doesn't access it,” he says. 

One issue with some online death binders is whether the company will even be around when the person dies, Mr. Hewson says.

“You need to know the company is going to be there when you die,” he says. “So, there has to be ongoing engagement or a subscription keeping people involved in the service.”

He says that with LifeLocker, clients receive annual reminders to verify and update their information.

Christa Ovenell, a licensed funeral director and death doula at Death's Apprentice Education and Planning in Vancouver, says the process of getting affairs in order is daunting for many. Buying a binder is one thing, doing the work is another, she notes. 

“It's hard work that's easy to avoid,” she says, and sometimes online binders exacerbate that feeling of reluctance. 

For example, Ms. Ovenell finds that seniors tend to be distrustful of keeping sensitive data in the cloud, often commenting that it's only useful if folks know how to access it.

While online makes it easier to make changes on the fly, Ms. Pahl finds most clients download the PDF, save it in their documents, but still print out the information to place in a physical binder with all the other documents. 

“Some things are just not fill-in-the-blanks. Some things are producing your birth certificate and putting it in the binder,” Ms. Pahl says, adding that she keeps those documents in plastic sleeves and stores the binder in a home safe. 

Once the binder is completed, the final step is ensuring the executor knows where to find and how to access it. 

“This is an act of love and kindness for your family,” Ms. Pahl says. “You don't want to be remembered as someone who left everything in chaos.”

Italy has sent a naval frigate to a flotilla of boats attempting to bring aid to the Gaza Strip. Activists, lawmakers and journalists in the convoy said drones attacked some of their boats. 

Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto condemned on Wednesday an apparent drone attack on the Global Sumud Flotilla as it left Greece en route toward Gaza.

He added that Italy was sending a naval ship to be nearby if the flotilla required assistance. ""The vessel is already en route to the area for possible rescue operations,"" Crosetto wrote on X.

""In a democracy, demonstrations and forms of protest must also be protected when they are carried out in accordance with international law and without resorting to violence,"" Crosetto said.

Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani called on Israel to ensure that no Italian citizens on any of the 51 ships in the convoy were harmed.

Italy's right-wing government does not support the activists and holds the Israeli blockade of Gaza to be lawful, but Tajani's office called on the Israeli government to remain in ""compliance with international law and the principle of absolute caution"" when dealing with those on board.

Some lawmakers with Italy's left-wing opposition parties are among the activists and journalists aboard the ships.

Israel has repeatedly criticized the flotilla, accusing those on board of complicity with the Hamas militant group. 

The Israeli Foreign Ministry warned on X that Israel ""would take the necessary measures"" to stop the flotilla if it did not accept a proposal to unload aid in an Israeli port.

""Israel will not allow vessels to enter an active combat zone and will not allow the breach of a lawful naval blockade,"" the ministry said Monday. ""Israel urges the participants not to break the law and to accept Israel's proposal for a peaceful transfer of any aid they might have.""

People aboard the ships reported ""flash bombs, explosive flares and suspected chemicals"" appearing above them overnight, counting ""15 or 16 drones.""

The vessels were attacked by 12 drones in international waters off the coast of the Greek island of Gavdos, said Marikaiti Stasinou, a spokesperson for March to Gaza Greece, which is part of the flotilla.

The Greek Coast Guard told news outlets that none of the boats were damaged. 

Two weeks ago, the flotilla said it had also experienced drone attacks while leaving Tunisia. Tunisian authorities have denied any involvement in the alleged attack.

The flotilla seeks to break the naval blockade of Gaza that started before the October 7, 2023, attacks led by Hamas in southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw about 250 more taken hostage. 

The  Israeli military campaign in response has killed tens of thousands and left hundreds of thousands without adequate food and medical supplies. International organizations, including United Nations bodies, have characterized Israel's policy in Gaza as a genocide. 

Earlier attempts by similar flotillas to reach Gaza over the summer were intercepted by Israeli forces and their passengers sent home.

Iranian President Pezeshkian downplayed Iran's nuclear aspirations ahead of expected snapback sanctions from European countries. Meanwhile, Ukraine's Zelenskyy warned that Putin wants to expand his war. DW has more. 



Read below for a roundup of the latest news, analyses and videos on the United Nations' 80th General Assembly session:

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian also spoke at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday. 

Pezeshkian told the chamber that Iran has ""no intention"" to build a nuclear bomb. 

""I hereby declare once more before this assembly that Iran has never sought and will never seek to build a nuclear bomb. We do not seek to build a nuclear bomb. We do not seek nuclear weapons,"" Pezeshkian said in his speech.  

Pezeshkian's speech comes in the wake of Israel bombing Iranian nuclear and military facilities in June, in what became known as the 12 day war.

The US military under President Donald Trump's administration also carried out targeted bombings of three Iranian nuclear sites on June 22.  

Pezeshkian characterized the Israeli and US attacks as a ""grevious blow upon international trust and the very prospect of peace in the region.""

Trump has repeatedly stated that the Islamic Republic of Iran must not obtain a nuclear weapon.

During Trump's first term in 2018, he pulled the US out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a deal in which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. The US then ramped up sanctions and other punitive measures against Iran after the withdrawal.     

China, France, the UK, Russia, Germany and the EU are also signatories in the JCPOA.

Last month, France, the UK, and Germany announced they would move forward with ""snapback sanctions"" against Iran, saying Tehran is not keeping up with its commitments in regards to the JCPOA.

Pezeshkian's assurances that Iran is not seeking a nuclear bomb come before a Saturday deadline when the snapback sanctions will be enacted.

Pezeshkian is meeting with European leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron at the UNGA in a last-minute bid to avert the sanctions. 

Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said hat the world was living through ""the most destructive arms race in history"" and called on the international community to act against Russia now, asserting that Vladimir Putin wants to expand his war in Europe.

""Ukraine is only the first and now Russian drones are already flying across Europe, and Russian operations are already spreading across countries, and Putin wants to continue this war by expanding it,"" Zelenskyy said.

He also warned that Europe could not afford to lose Moldova, a strategically located country, to Russian influence after Belarus and Georgia fell into Moscow's orbit.

""Russia's trying to do to Moldova what Iran once did to Lebanon and the global response again, not enough. We have already lost Georgia in Europe... and for many, many years, Belarus has also been moving toward dependence on Russia. Europe cannot afford to lose Moldova too,"" the Ukrainian president said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be the second speaker addressing the UN General Assembly after King Felipe VI of Spain on Wednesday at 9 a.m. local time (1300 UTC/GMT)

The other speakers include Masoud Pezeshkian (President of Iran), Javier Milei (President of Argentina) and Ahmad Al-Sharaa (President of Syria).

Head of states from Monaco, Panama, Switzerland, Kenya, Finland, and the Marshall Islands are among the 32 leaders scheduled to speak.

More than 110 world leaders are expected to attend a special United Nations climate summit on Wednesday, where they are expected to present new commitments and press for faster action to phase out coal, oil and gas that cause climate change.

A stalled escalator and a faulty teleprompter featured in US President Donald Trump's United Nations General Assembly speech on Tuesday, prompting the White House to threaten an investigation.

Video footage showed the president and first lady Melania Trump briefly stranded on an unmoving escalator at UN headquarters.

Later, a malfunctioning teleprompter led Trump to quip, ""All I got from the United Nations was a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter.""

The White House suggested the mishaps may have been deliberate and said it is investigating whether the moving stairway was stopped on purpose to humiliate the president.

""If we find that these were UN and staffers who were purposefully trying to trip up, literally, trip up the President and the first lady of the United States, well, there better be accountability for those people, and I will personally see to it,"" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Fox News Tuesday evening.

The UN refuted the claims, with Stephane Dujarric, a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, saying in a statement that a videographer from the US delegation filming Trump's arrival may have triggered a safety function at the top of the escalator. The escalator was soon back in operation.

""Regarding the teleprompter, we have no comment since the teleprompter for the US president is operated by the White House,"" Dujarric said. 

European countries Germany, France and Britain are set to hold talks with Iran behind the scenes at the UN General Assembly.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said a plan to explore ""last ditch options"" comes as efforts intensify for Iran to avert sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program.

Speaking to journalists, Wadephul struck a realistic tone regarding the talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.

""It must be clear to everyone that, after all of Iran's delaying tactics, the possibilities and chances of reaching a diplomatic solution before the sanctions are triggered are extremely slim,"" he said. 

Continuous attempts have been made to prevent Iran from enriching uranium, due to fears Tehran is pursuing nuclear weapons.

However, Iran has maintained its nuclear program is solely for civilian purposes.

Last month, Germany, France and Britain triggered a ""snapback"" sanctions mechanism.

The trio accused Iran of breaching the 2015 Vienna nuclear accord, saying the current levels of uranium enrichment are beyond those needed for civilian purposes.

""Iran has been disregarding its obligations under the Vienna nuclear agreement for years,"" Wadephul said. ""We have drawn the necessary conclusions from this and triggered the so-called snapback mechanism, which will reinstate international sanctions against Iran at the end of this week.""

Colombia's President Gustavo Petro called for a ""criminal process"" against US President Donald Trump in front of the UN General Assembly on Tuesday.

He argued that Trump must be investigated for missile strikes on alleged drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean.

In a speech that was conducted earlier in the day, Trump vowed to ""blow [drug smugglers] out of existence.""

More than a dozen people have died in strikes on at least three vessels in attacks UN experts have described as an ""extrajudicial execution.""

Petro suspects some of those killed in the US boat strikes were Colombian and said that if the victims were indeed Colombians, ""a criminal process must be initiated against those officials who are from the United States. This includes the senior official who gave the order, President Trump.""

Trump has sent eight warships and a submarine to the southern Caribbean as part of an operation he claims is to combat drug smugglers off the coast of Venezuela.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukraine would be willing to nominate Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize if the US president could end Russia's war against his country.

""Trump has a chance to end this war. If he ends it — I'm absolutely sure all Ukrainians will gladly do it [nominate him]. Because it's an unbelievable mission — to end it,"" Zelenskyy said on the fringes of the UN General Assembly.

Speaking about his meeting with Trump at the gathering in New York, Zelenskyy added: ""We had a very good meeting today… It's too early to talk about the details. It was probably the most substantive one.""

When asked whether he would want Zelenskyy to nominate him for the Peace Prize, Trump said: ""Why not.""

DW correspondent Michaela Küfner has been attending day one of the General Debate at the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

Reflecting on the demeanor and speech from Donald Trump earlier, Küfner said the US president ""paused on his way to the UN podium to take in the applause.""

Küfner noted how Trump repeated ""claims to have ended seven wars and dangled some hope of sanctions against Russia in front of his European allies in the room.""

""In exchange he wants Europe to stop paying Vladimir Putin for exporting energy to the continent,"" Küfner added.

Trump attracted a ""decent applause"" at the end of his speech, prompting many to leave, in the belief they had ""heard the most relevant voice,"" DW's chief political editor said.

But Trump cast a dark cloud as he departed the stage, ""leaving behind a wounded United Nations — 80 years old and weakened by its inability to reform, it just got a kick by the man who wants to be seen to be the most powerful man in the world,"" Küfner concluded.

China could pressure Russia to stop its war against Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the UN Security Council on Tuesday.

""If China truly wanted this war to stop, it could compel Moscow to end the invasion. Without China, Putin's Russia is nothing,"" Zelenskyy told the council.

A permanent member of the Security Council, China is not involved in the war, but Kyiv has criticized Beijing arguing that China has supplied items to Russia that can be used in its war against Ukraine.

China has denied supporting Russia's war. Deputy Chinese ambassador to the UN, Geng Shuang, said China has been upholding an ""objective, impartial position"" and advocating for ""peace talks towards a political settlement.""

Meanwhile, Zelenskyy hailed a ""big shift"" in Donald Trump's position after the US president said Kyiv could win back all the territory captured by Russia.

French President Emmanuel Macron will use the occasion of the United Nations General Assembly as an opportunity to hold discussions with his Iranian counterpart.

Macron said in his speech at the UNGA that he would hold the talks with President Masoud Pezeshkian as efforts continue to avert sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear program intensify.

""Either Iran makes a gesture and goes back to the path of peace and accountability that make it possible to get back on course... or sanctions will have to be imposed,"" he said.

""I'll have an occasion to meet with the president tomorrow (Wednesday) on each of these crucial issues.""

US President Donald Trump appeared to shift his rhetoric about the war in Ukraine, following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.

""After getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia Military and Economic situation and, after seeing the Economic trouble it is causing Russia, I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form,"" Trump wrote in his social media platform Truth Social.

""With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option,"" Trump added.

Trump said Russia had been fighting ""aimlessly"" in a war that a ""real military power"" would have won in less than a week.

""Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act,"" the US president said, adding that he wished both countries well and that the US will ""continue to supply weapons to NATO for NATO to do what they want with them.""

As the UN General Assembly was underway, Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, addressed the Security Council over a recent Israeli strike on Doha.

Israeli warplanes attacked a residential area in the Qatari capital on September 9, hitting the residence of Hamas leaders and their families.

Six people were killed in the attack, including the son of Hamas' top negotiator and a Qatari security officer.

""No party seeks to assassinate a negotiating delegation except with the aim of thwarting the negotiations,"" Tamim told the Security Council.

He called the strike a ""treacherous assault"" and ""a blatant act of state terrorism.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the time that the attack was ""fully justified"" in response to the October 7 terror attack by Hamas in 2023.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said Germany's recognizing of the state of Palestine was ""a question of when.""

Speaking to DW's chief political editor, Michaela Küfner, in New York as the UN marks its 80th anniversary, Wadephul said EU member states ""are all united in the goal of a two-state solution"" and ""only the question of when to recognize the state of Palestine is dividing us.""

Unlike the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France and other Western allies of Israel, Germany has yet to formally recognize Palestinian statehood.

""You know that Germany is reluctant to do this step. It's more a question of time, of course, because we are engaged in building a Palestinian state, but that needs some time, and that needs especially negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians,"" Wadephul said when asked about European allies' recognition of Palestinian statehood.

On the infringement of Estonian airspace and Denmark's reports of a drone attack, Wadephul said NATO was standing together ""very firmly"" and making it clear that ""we defend every inch of NATO territory."" 

Wadephul said ""a flexible response"" was always NATO's strategy.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan used his UN General Assembly address Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza.

""A genocide is continuing in Gaza,"" Erdogan said. ""Even as we meet here innocent people are dying.""

He said he was speaking ""on behalf of the Palestinian people,"" who he said had been silenced.

""There is no war in Gaza, there are no two sides. This is an invasion, a genocide, a policy of mass massacre,"" he added.

The Turkish leader's comments come after an independent commission of the UN Human Rights Council found that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel has repeatedly denied such claims.

During his speech, Erdogan held up photos of women waiting for rations, an emaciated child and a street filled with displaced Palestinians.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

A large crevasse opened up outside a hospital in a residential area of Bangkok. Authorities believe heavy rain, a leaking drainpipe, and nearby construction are to blame.

Authorities in the Thai capital of Bangkok on Wednesday were tackling a large sinkhole that appeared when a piece of busy road collapsed 50 meters (160 feet) into the ground.

The sinkhole appeared in front of the city's main hospitals and near a police station in a residential neighborhood of the city. The site was cordoned off and people living and working nearby were asked to evacuate.

Suriyachai Rawiwan, head of Bangkok's disaster agency, told the AFP news agency that heavy rain likely eroded a large underground water pipe that may have already been leaking, causing the damage. 

Thailand's Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters that ""dirt from an underground train construction was sliding in,"" exacerbating the issue. 

""Luckily there are no deaths or injuries,"" he added.

Footage on social media showed pieces of the road slowly sinking into the ground, widening the hole. Utilities and electricity were affected in the area near the incident.

Local authorities cautioned residents and onlookers to stay away, saying that the area was still dangerous.

Thanks for tuning in to our live blog after a gunman opened fire at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas, killing one and leaving two injured.

This blog is now closed. Read the full story here.

Kash Patel, the FBI director, has labelled the shooting a “despicable, politically motivated” attack against law enforcement.

“While the investigation is ongoing, an initial review of the evidence shows an idealogical motive behind this attack,” he wrote.

“One of the unspent shell casings recovered was engraved with the phrase “ANTI ICE.” More updates will be forthcoming. These despicable, politically motivated attacks against law enforcement are not a one-off.”

Senator Ted Cruz warned that demonising ICE officers fuels political violence.

“Politician demanding that ICE agents be doxed and calling for people to go after their families: stop,” he told the press conference.

“Violence has no place. It is wrong, and we should come together.”

He added that the correct place to debate immigration policy was in Congress, not by condemning government agents doing their jobs.

“If we want to have a debate about immigration policies. We can do so in the halls of Congress without demonising each other, and especially without demonising the men and women who every day put on a badge.”

 

Senator Ted Cruz has issued a message of unity, warning that political violence “must stop”.

Speaking at the press conference, he said: “This needs to stop. Violence is wrong. Politically motivated violence is wrong.

“It was two weeks ago today that we saw a political assassination in Utah that tore the heart out of much of this country.”

In a swipe at political leaders who have weaponised recent acts of violence for their own political agendas, he said: “To every politician who is using rhetoric demonising ICE and demonising CBP: stop.”

Bullets found next to the gunman who carried out today's shooting were inscribed with anti-ICE messages, the FBI said.

Joseph Rothrock, the head of the Texas FBI field office, said: “I could also share with you is that early evidence that we've seen from rounds that were found near the suspected shooter contain messages that are anti ice in nature. 

“Again, this is just the most recent example of this type of attack.”

He added that the FBI is treating the attack as an “act of targeted violence”.

Daniel Comeaux, the Dallas police chief, said that four people were shot, including the shooter.

The Dallas mayor has called for calm from his constituents as rumours swirl over the killer's motive.

Speaking at the press conference, Eric Johnson said: “Let's be patient. Let's remain calm, and let's let our law enforcement partners, our police department, do their job. 

“This is an active investigation. There's still a lot of unanswered questions, and I want to encourage all of you to exercise a little bit of restraint and allow them to do their job.”

A press conference has started in Dallas Texas with Mayor Eric Johnson urging his constituents to pray for those affected by the shooting.

“Join me also in praying for this city that we can come together at a time like this,” he said.

The shooting at an ICE facility will not slow the deportation of illegal migrants, Texas governor Greg Abbott has said.

Mr Abbott said that the state “fully supports” ICE agents and is working to get to the bottom of the gunman's motive.

Texas fully supports ICE 💯Both the Texas Dept. of Public Safety & Texas National Guard work closely with ICE.This assassination will NOT slow our arrest, detention, & deportation of illegal immigrants.We will work with ICE & the Dallas Police Dept. to get to the bottom of…

Migrants who had appointments at the ICE facility have been turned away in the wake of this morning's shooting, according to reports.

This morning's shooting took place at an ICE field office rather than a detention centre.

An ICE field office is an administrative office for agency staff, whereas detention centres are secure facilities used for holding migrants.

The Dallas field office has four holding cells and detainees are processed there before being transferred to a detention facility according to CNN. 

At least one detainee was killed in the attack, and no agents were injured, officials said.

Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, earlier updated her post on X to reflect that it was in fact a field office that was targeted.

Wednesday's shooting comes at a tense time in the US. Charlie Kirk, a conservative campaigner was shot dead while addressing a rally of students at Utah Valley University on Sept 10. President Donald Trump and his top team appeared in front of tens of thousands of people at a memorial service on Sunday, and the nation is on edge amid fears of more political violence.

Authorities are investigating whether today's shooter opened fire from a rooftop, as Kirk's alleged killer is believed to have done.  A man who shot at Mr Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year, also shot from a rooftop.ICE has also been a focal point for anger among Mr Trump's opponents who object to his massive deportation push.

Whatever the motives of the shooter turn out to be, the result is another surge in fears that the US could see more attacks.

Mike Pence, the former vice president, has blamed the Left for today's shooting.

“Praying for the victims and their families following the shooting at @ICEgov field office in Dallas,” he wrote on X.

“The Left's targeting of our brave men and women in uniform MUST STOP NOW. God Bless All the Brave Men and Women of ICE.”

A motive for the attack has not been established and no ICE agents were hurt, officials have said. 

A press conference on this morning's shooting has been delayed.

The briefing was scheduled to take place at 3pm (9am local time), but microphones are still being set up.

It is expected to commence shortly.

JD Vance, the vice president, has linked the shooting to an “obsessive attack against law enforcement”.

No ICE agents were injured during the attack, officials have said, and at least one migrant was killed.

The obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop. I'm praying for everyone hurt in this attack and for their families. https://t.co/wEN3sqyGyQ

One person was killed and two hospitalised after the gunman opened fire at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas, the local police department said.

On September 24, 2025, at about 6:40 a.m., Dallas Police responded to an assist officer call in the 8100 block of north Stemmons Freeway. The preliminary investigation determined that a suspect opened fire at a government building from an adjacent building. Two people were…

The FBI is “fully engaged” in the investigation, Dan Bongino, the deputy director, has said.

Mr Bongino said the bureau is working “in conjunction with our state and federal law enforcement partners”.

The FBI is fully engaged, in conjunction with our state and federal law enforcement partners, at the crime scene in Dallas.

One migrant has been shot dead and multiple others injured by a “possible sniper” at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas.

The shooting unfolded at around 7am on Wednesday morning, multiple news outlets reported.

Police said one person had been killed and two injured after the gunman opened fire from a nearby building.

The suspected shooter is “down” from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, Immigration and Customs Enforcement director Todd Lyons told CNN.

“Preliminary information is a possible sniper,” Mr Lyons said.

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland security spokeswoman, has said that the agency is looking into the possibility that the suspected sniper fired from a nearby rooftop.

In a statement, homeland security secretary Kristi Noem said: “There was a shooting this morning at the Dallas @ICEgov Field Office.

“Details are still emerging but we can confirm there were multiple injuries and fatalities.

“The shooter is deceased by a self-inflicted gun shot wound.

“While we don't know motive yet, we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them. It must stop. “Please pray for the victims and their families.”

My team and I are closely monitoring the situation at the ICE Detention Facility in Dallas. We are praying for the swift recovery of those injured, and we are deeply grateful to the brave first responders who rushed to the scene. https://t.co/1BDJVrehre

Highway camera footage shared on X shows dozens of emergency service cars responding to the scene.

The Dallas ICE facility where a gunman opened fire this morning was targeted by a bomb threat in August.

On August 25, a man arrived at the facility and “claimed to have a bomb in his backpack”, according to a Department of Homeland Security statement.

“We've seen a lot of violence at ICE facilities, and this is not the first time that we've seen an attack, even this year at an ICE facility,” Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland security spokeswoman, told Fox News this morning.

The gunman who shot multiple people at an ICE facility in Dallas possibly opened fire from a nearby rooftop, officials have suggested.

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland security spokeswoman, has said that the agency is looking into the possibility that the suspected sniper fired from a nearby rooftop.

If confirmed, it would be the second high-profile shooting involving a sniper in recent weeks, after Charlie Kirk was killed by a single gunshot fired from a rooftop at a university event in Utah earlier this month.

Tyer Robinson has been charged with killing the prominent conservative activist.

No ICE officers were hurt in the shooting, an agency official has said.

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland security spokeswoman, confirmed to Fox News that ICE agents were not injured but that security at the site may have been.

She added that the investigation was a “fluid situation” and no motive has been identified.

Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security director, has warned that ICE facilities are facing ‘unprecedented violence'.

“While we don't know motive yet, we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them. It must stop. Please pray for the victims and their families,” she wrote on X.

This morning's attack marked at least the third instance of an ICE facility being targeted by gunfire in Texas this year, according to CNN.

In July, 10 suspects were charged for attacking an ICE detention centre in nearby Alvarado, Texas, killing an officer in the process.

The suspects were equipped with tactical gear and weapons, according to ICE.

The gunman who carried out the attack at an ICE facility is dead, officials said.

Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security director, said that the suspect had died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The shooter was described as a white male, police told Fox.

ICE Director Todd Lyons earlier confirmed to CNN that the shooter is “down”.

There was a shooting this morning at the Dallas @ICEgov Detention Facility. Details are still emerging but we can confirm there were multiple injuries and fatalities. The shooter is deceased by a self-inflicted gun shot wound. While we don't know motive yet, we know that our…

At least two detainees were injured in the shooting, officials told CNN.

Todd Lyons, the ICE director, earlier told the network that three people were shot in total and taken to hospital.

Reports suggest at least three people were hit in the attack.

Highway camera footage shows dozens of police cars responding to the scene.

The video shows almost 30 vehicles with flashing lights parked off Dallas's I-35E highway after multiple were shot at a nearby ICE facility.

The footage, obtained by CNN, was captured around 8.20am ET.

Multiple people have reportedly been shot by a “possible sniper” at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas.

			Agency's former employees have until Oct 6 to accept or decline offer to return to work after cost-cutting drive

Hundreds of US government employees who lost their jobs in Elon Musk's cost-cutting drive are being asked to return to work.

The General Services Administration (GSA) – which manages government workspaces – has given its former employees until the end of the week to accept or decline reinstatement, according to an internal memo obtained by the Associated Press.

Those who accept must report for duty on Oct 6 after what amounts to a seven-month paid leave.

Mr Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) identified the GSA, which had about 12,000 employees at the start of the Trump administration, as a chief target of its campaign to reduce fraud, waste and abuse in the federal government.

Starting in March, thousands of GSA employees left the agency in programs that encouraged them to resign or take early retirement.

A small cohort of Mr Musk's trusted aides stayed in the GSA's headquarters, sometimes sleeping in cots on the agency's sixth floor, and pursued plans to cancel nearly half of the 7,500 leases in the federal portfolio.

Doge also wanted the GSA to sell hundreds of federally owned buildings with the goal of generating billions in savings, publishing a list of hundreds of government buildings that were targeted for sale.

The GSA sent more than 800 lease cancellation notices to landlords, in many cases without informing the tenants.

Pushback against the GSA's dumping of its portfolio was swift, and both initiatives had been scaled back. More than 480 leases put forward for termination by Doge have since been spared.

The leases were for offices scattered around the country that are occupied by such agencies as the Internal Revenue Service, Social Security Administration and Food and Drug Administration.

Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official, said: “Ultimately, the outcome was the agency was left broken and understaffed.

“They didn't have the people they needed to carry out basic functions.”

Mr Becker, who represents owners with government leases at Arco Real Estate Solutions, said GSA had been in a “triage mode” for months.

He said the sudden reversal of the downsizing reflected how Mr Musk and Doge had gone too far, too fast.

Doge's “wall of receipts,” which once boasted that the lease cancellations alone would save nearly $460m, has since reduced that estimate to $140m by the end of July, according to Mr Becker.

Recommended

As part of its cost-cutting drive, the GSA cut the GSA's headquarters staff by 79 per cent, its portfolio managers by 65 per cent and facilities managers by 35 per cent, according to a federal official.

The official, who was not authorised to speak to the media, provided the statistics on condition of anonymity.

Because of the internal turmoil, 131 leases expired without the government actually vacating the properties, the official said.

The situation has exposed the agencies to steep fees because property owners have not been able to rent out those spaces to other tenants.

David Marroni, a senior official at the Government Accountability Office, said the congressional watchdog is examining the GSA's management of its workforce, lease terminations and planned building disposals, and expects to issue findings in the coming months.

How am I to endure the feeling of being homeless in Al-Rimal, the neighborhood where I grew up — now reduced to a ghost city after so many apartment towers were destroyed? How can I be displaced in my own city, with no place left for me in the north or the south? I am homeless in my homeland.

On September 14, we received a sudden evacuation order. Soon after, Al-Jundi Tower — the high-rise apartment building beside us — was bombed, along with the building across the street, leaving half of the apartment building that I lived in destroyed. And yet, despite the devastation and the danger, we returned to the seventh floor to collect our mattresses — because in Gaza, you cannot simply buy new ones. There are no supplies, no mattresses, no tents, and if they exist, they are unbearably expensive; a single tent now costs as much as $1,500. We preserve what little we have, no matter the cost.

That night, at around 11 pm, after the occupation had carried out its threats, we came back to find our home half-destroyed, with only one room left intact. We gathered all our mattresses and went to my grandmother's house, planning to return in the morning to decide where we could stay. Then came the mockery: The army told our neighbor from the Kollak family — after destroying the tower — “Now you can return to your homes, then you must evacuate to the south.” They knew perfectly well that our homes were already in ruins. It was not an order — it was humiliation.

Sleeping in our apartment felt like sleeping in a haunted house. Being there was like lying in the middle of the street, but on the seventh floor — a shattered home seven stories up.

We returned in the morning to a home unfit for life, trying to decide what to do despite the danger. My father decided to go south with my brother Mohammad and my cousin Kareem to search for a house to rent, while my mother, my sister, and I stayed in the north until they found us a place. Sleeping in our apartment felt like sleeping in a haunted house. Being there was like lying in the middle of the street, but on the seventh floor — a shattered home seven stories up. Suddenly, the sky turned red, and a massive blast shook the entire building. These were not ordinary strikes; they were a new kind of attack — explosive robots carrying enormous charges, capable of wiping out an entire neighborhood in an instant. The situation was unbearable: staying in that house meant death, and leaving it meant another kind of death.

My father called to check on us and told us he could hear the explosions in the south from their sheer intensity. He said to my mother, “Unfortunately, there is no place to stay in the south except a tent, and we cannot live in a tent.” My mother replied, “Return to the north, and let's see what we can do.”

My father, my brother, and my cousin came back and told us that there was no shelter available due to the crushing concentration of people.

Father called a friend from the Al-Astal family, who told him: “There is no place for you, Emad, except a tent. You must choose: death or life in a tent — and even then, death is still possible. There is no safety in the north or the south, but the south is slightly better. You must move.”

It was an unbearably difficult choice, yet we decided to stay in the Al-Rimal neighborhood, as my father said, “until our last breath,” and only then would we walk south on foot. Staying until our “last breath” meant staying until the situation escalated, until the Israeli army entered our street, leaving us with no choice but to face it or flee.

As time passed, the situation became unbearable. The entire neighborhood had been evacuated, leaving only a handful of small families — about six in total. Explosions escalated wildly, while the quadcopters never stopped firing and dropping bombs in the streets.

My father decided to bring our mattresses to the south on the morning of September 22, while we remained in the north. If the Israeli forces came, we would leave quickly, but at least our mattresses would be waiting for us in the south. My father and my brother carried the mattresses to a tent, a journey that took them 10 hours. Normally, before the war, it would have taken only an hour, but due to the population density and lack of transportation, the journey was extremely difficult.

While waiting for them to return, my mother decided that we should move to the fourth floor, which was less exposed to danger than the upper floors, where shards of debris constantly fall during every explosion, bringing death.

Suddenly, we heard the sound of a ferocious bombing … The seventh and eighth floors of our building had been hit.

I had no idea that my mother's decision would save our lives. At around 5 pm, we were terrified, waiting for my father and everyone else, who kept calling to tell us to leave the area as the danger escalated. Suddenly, we heard the sound of a ferocious bombing — it shocked us, and we screamed: “Where is this happening? What is going on?!” In an instant, the house was filled with dust. The seventh and eighth floors of our building had been hit.

We didn't know what to do without my father and brother. Who could help us? Our remaining neighbors were shouting, and our neighbor Tawfiq Shaqoura said, “Hurry! Get out! This could be a warning missile for the tower!” We ran out, crying and terrified, and stood in the street, waiting. Then my uncle called: “Come to my place until your father arrives, hurry!”

We walked along the road while the bombing continued. People were running in the streets, preparing to evacuate. We rested briefly until my father arrived in the north. Then we decided to continue our evacuation south: we would settle for the tent, because we had no other choice.

Now, I write this at dawn while the ground shakes beneath my feet, and we search for transportation to take us south — but it is not an easy task. I wonder: what comes next? How long will I remain in a tent? How long will I be homeless in my homeland, the place that once held me? Do I not have the right to live safely in my own country, in my own home?

Israeli attacks have forced a pediatric hospital and the only eye care hospital in Gaza to close, according to Middle East Eye. 

The pediatric hospital, Al-Rantisi Hospital, provides care not available anywhere else in Gaza, the outlet reports.

“There are no safe routes to reach hospitals and medical facilities, preventing patients and the wounded from accessing care,” the Palestinian health ministry said in a statement, as per Middle East Eye. “The occupation is deliberately and systematically targeting the healthcare system in Gaza City as part of its policy of genocide against the population of the Gaza Strip.”

Israel has repeatedly attacked Gaza's hospitals, health care workers, patients, and rescue workers. Since October 2023, Israel has massacred more than 1,700 medical staff and attacked 38 hospitals. 

In July, Israel killed renowned cardiologist Marwan Sultan, the director of Indonesian Hospital, while he was in his home. He was the the 70th health care worker killed by Israel in the previous 50 days, according to Healthcare Workers Watch – Palestine, a group that monitors attacks on Gaza's health care system. His daughter told The New Yorker the “missile was dropped on his room exactly, on his place, on him precisely.” 

“My father was just a doctor, just a human caring for patients,” Ahmad, another one of his children, told NBC News.

In August, Israel bombed Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in a so-called “double tap” strike. Video shows the second strike targeting rescuers who came to the scene. Four health care workers and five journalists were killed in the attack. Since October 2023, Israel has killed more than 200 journalists in Gaza.  

Israel has also abducted, imprisoned, and tortured hundreds of health care workers, many of whom were taken from their hospitals, according to Healthcare Workers Watch – Palestine. 

Those detained have included “irreplaceable consultants and specialists in essential specialities like General Surgery, Vascular Surgery, Orthopaedics Surgery, Anaesthesiology, Intensive Care, Cardiology, Paediatrics, and Obstetrics and Gynaecology,” the group said. 

Twenty of the physicians detained as of July were abducted from their hospitals, three were taken from medical convoys to transfer patients through Israel-designated “safe routes,” and one was kidnapped in front of a hospital, according to Healthcare Workers Watch. 

In December, Israel abducted Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, a pediatrician and director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital. Video shows him walking up to Israeli tanks, wearing his white coat. During his detention he has been beaten with electric shocks and batons, and lost one-third of his body weight. Human rights groups have demanded his release — calls that Israel has ignored.

Israel's blockade on Gaza has deprived surviving health care workers of essential medical supplies, which has forced doctors to perform medical procedures, including amputations on children and cesarean sections, without anesthesia. 

“At every point in their effort to provide care, volunteer health care professionals face systematic practices and policies that directly impact their ability to prevent suffering and loss in Gaza; specifically restrictions that prohibit them from bringing in basic supplies critical to providing lifesaving care,” concluded a report by Physicians for Human Rights. 

“[S]weeping and unpredictable restrictions, imposed by Israeli authorities under the guise of ‘dual use' item limitations, resulted in foreseeable, severe, and often preventable pain and anguish to the women, men, and children who came to them seeking care,” the report continued.

A broad draft Authorization for Use of Military Force could give wide latitude to go after supposed “narco-terrorists.”

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

A draft proposal to authorize the use of U.S. military force against drug cartels is currently floating around Congress and the White House, according to a recent New York Times report. Although an official version of the proposal has yet to be released, publicly available information suggests that it could be used to justify U.S. military intervention in at least 60 countries.

The U.S.-led “War on Drugs” has escalated rapidly over the last month: after the White House signed a secret directive authorizing attacks on Latin American drug cartels, the U.S. built up its military presence in the region and began conducting a series of deadly airstrikes on alleged drug-smuggling civilian boats in the international waters of the Caribbean. Human Rights Watch called the strikes “unlawful extrajudicial killings.”

How far Washington should go in its new counternarcotics campaign has been a source of controversy within the Trump administration. When the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) proposed the use of the U.S. military to attack cartels within Mexican territory during a White House meeting earlier this year, officials from the Defense Department and other agencies reportedly objected, in part because the executive branch lacked sufficient legal authorization to do so.

Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.

An “Authorization for Use of Military Force” (AUMF) is the instrument most often used to provide legal justification for military hostilities today. AUMF legislation passed in response to the 9/11 attacks laid the groundwork for a “Global War on Terror” that included targeting many suspects who had nothing to do with 9/11. Because of its extremely broad language, the 2001 AUMF has since been used to justify military interventions in at least 22 countries.

A proposal reportedly brought forth by Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) for a new AUMF aimed at “narco-terrorists” began circulating around Washington last week. Apparently modeled on the 2001 AUMF, Mills' new AUMF is similarly broad: although it only lasts for five years, the authorization does not identify specific targets and contains no geographic restrictions.

In comments given to the Times, Harvard Professor Jack Goldsmith described the proposal as “insanely broad,” essentially “an open-ended war authorization against an untold number of countries, organizations and persons that the president could deem within its scope.” The version of the AUMF that has been attributed to Rep. Mills would give the president the ability to use “all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations or persons the President determines are designated narco-terrorists,” including those who provide financing or support to narco-terrorists.

Earlier this year, the White House added a long list of Latin American drug cartels to the national “Foreign Terrorist Organizations” (FTO) list. Although the full text of Mills' AUMF hasn't been confirmed, under his reported proposal, the president could have the authority to wage war against any of these organizations, regardless of where they are operating. Given the highly globalized nature of the drug trade and the contested definition of who is included within “drug cartels,” this could include U.S. military action in dozens of different countries. Based on what is known about it so far, Mills' proposal would leave “a large amount of discretion in the hands of the executive to make determinations about who ‘counts' within the scope of targeting,” said Elizabeth Beavers, assistant professor of law at Widener University's Delaware Law School.

The Sinaloa Cartel, for example, designated as a FTO by the Trump administration in February, operates in “at least 47 countries,” according to the DEA. In a five–part series of articles on the “foreign policies of the Sinaloa Cartel and CJNG [another Mexican cartel]”, scholar Vanda Felbab-Brown lists some of the countries that are allegedly involved in the Sinaloa's activities: Albania, Australia, Belgium, Cape Verde, Chile, China, Colombia, the DRC, Ecuador, France, Germany, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Ireland, India, Italy, Mali, Morocco, Mozambique, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the “Northern Triangle” nations of Central America, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Peru, Portugal, Romania, Senegal, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, and the UK. Other countries with Sinaloa Cartel activity include Belize, Canada, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Guyana, Panama, and Thailand.

If the proposed AUMF had targeted the Sinaloa Cartel alone, it could theoretically authorize U.S. military interventions in at least 42 nations. But this is only one of many cartels that has been designated as a terrorist organization by the Trump administration. War against the CJNG would add Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Turkey, Uruguay, and Venezuela to the list. Cartels like Tren de Aragua have an established presence in Costa Rica. Meanwhile, the Trump administration designated several more countries as high-priority drug transit routes, specifically arguing that our “assistance” was “vital to the national interests of the United States” in Afghanistan, Bolivia, Colombia, Myanmar, and Venezuela.

Taken together, the combined forces of the proposed AUMF and the terrorist designations for cartels could allow the U.S. president to intervene in almost every nation in the continental Americas. Taken literally, the AUMF might even be abused to justify hostilities within the United States, as the terrorist-designated MS-13 gang was created in Los Angeles and maintains extensive operations throughout the U.S. In practice, however, this is highly unlikely.

“There are still a whole host of constitutional protections against extrajudicial targeting of persons within the U.S. that an AUMF doesn't just sweep away,” said Beavers. Still, this assumes that the president would be willing to abide by these protections. “This entire conversation about lawfulness rests entirely on what the other branches of government, including the courts, are willing to do about such violations,” she added.

U.S. authorities have long tried to expand their power by blending together the War on Drugs and the War on Terror, often using the controversial idea of “narco-terrorism” to make the connection. In 2011, the DEA claimed that 39% of Foreign Terrorist Organizations had “confirmed links to the drug trade.” This newly-proposed AUMF could therefore be applied to many traditional terrorist organizations, including al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, and the Taliban. This means the AUMF could provide additional authorities (on top of those from prior AUMFs) for the U.S. to involve itself in the countries where these groups operate. Such a list would likely include the Taliban's involvement in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Hezbollah's involvement in Lebanon, and a long list of countries alleged by the U.S. government to have al-Qaeda affiliates: Algeria, Burkina Faso, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen.

The U.S. has also long accused the Colombian National Liberation Army (ELN) of narco-trafficking. Because of Cuba's involvement in negotiations between the ELN and the Colombian government, Washington has insisted upon the classification of the island nation as a “State Sponsor of Terrorism.” Thus, the White House could theoretically use this proposed AUMF to engage in military hostilities in Cuba. Similarly, U.S. attempts at linking Venezuela's government leadership with an alleged “Cartel of the Suns” could be used to engage in a war against the Venezuelan military, not just the cartels alleged to operate within the nation.

Adding together all of these potential applications of the proposed AUMF, the bill would create justifications for the White House to engage in offensive military activity in more than 60 nations. While there's currently no indication that Congress is eager to take up, let alone pass, an extremely broad new military force authorization, if it were to become law, it would fully merge two of the largest policy failures in U.S. history — the War on Drugs and the War on Terror — into one singular concept that could expand armed conflict throughout the entire Western hemisphere and beyond.

 But U.S. Policy Is Forcing New Delhi to Turn to Its Rival

 Tanvi Madan

In August, five years after a fatal military clash between China and India, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi traveled to Tianjin to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. The visit marked Modi's first trip to China since relations between the Asian neighbors soured in 2020. Western analysts were struck by images of Modi holding hands and laughing with Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Several observers feared that U.S. President Donald Trump's tirades and tariffs—he imposed a 50 percent tariff rate on India over the summer—had pushed New Delhi into Beijing's arms.

That assertion gets both cause and effect wrong. Modi's meeting with Xi was neither a sudden response to Trump's bullying nor a hurried reset of India's relationship with China. And New Delhi is certainly not in Beijing's arms, nor is it striving alongside Beijing and Moscow to establish a new anti-Western order. India has indeed been working with China for nearly a year to return some measure of stability to bilateral relations. Those efforts, however, don't obviate the fact that the rivalry between the two Asian giants persists.

But Trump's pressure on India and his seeming desire to arrive at some kind of grand bargain with China will invariably affect the calculus of Indian policymakers. With concern, they will see Washington's coercive approach toward New Delhi and the contrasting gentler posture toward Beijing as a break from recent U.S. policy, which stressed the imperative of deterring China and helped drive the United States and India closer. Indian officials will not want to be left at such a disadvantage, and that alarm could increase the extent of India's reengagement with China. That, in turn, will have implications for American interests in the region. If Trump continues to target India, it could lead to a situation in which India opts to cooperate less with and buy less from the United States and to potentially do more with China and others—the opposite of the Trump administration's stated desire to strengthen ties with New Delhi.

The thaw in what had been an icy Chinese-Indian relationship was first evident in October 2024 at the convening of the non-Western grouping known as BRICS, when Modi and Xi had a bilateral meeting for the first time since 2019. The two sides announced that they had completed troop disengagement at the border, a key step on the path to normalizing relations. Both Beijing and New Delhi were ready to change the temperature. China had been facing strategic and economic headwinds, including flagging growth, pressure from the United States, and concern in Europe about Chinese support for Russia. India, for its part, did not want to fret about the prospect of further clashes along the border and instead wanted to focus on boosting its economic growth and bolstering Indian capabilities for the larger competition with China. And at the time, neither side knew who would next occupy the White House and how it might affect U.S. policy toward China.

Since then, the frost between China and India has melted further. The countries revived border talks among their special representatives in December 2024, with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi traveling to New Delhi this August. On the multilateral front, despite Xi skipping the G-20 summit in India in 2023, India sent several senior officials, including its defense minister, external affairs minister, and national security adviser, to China for various meetings this year in support of Beijing's presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.

These consultations have opened the door to additional conciliatory steps, including the revival of civil society exchanges, an agreement to restart direct flights between the two countries, India once again issuing visas for Chinese tourists, and China restoring access for Indians to the pilgrimage to Kailash Mansarovar, a sacred Hindu site in Chinese-held Tibet.

Perhaps more significant is the possibility of selective economic reengagement. In 2020, concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic and that year's border clashes led New Delhi to impose restrictions on Chinese economic and technology-related activities in India. These included additional scrutiny of investments from China, the exclusion of Chinese companies from India's 5G network, and the banning of Chinese apps such as TikTok. In the last couple of years, Indian firms, including some of the country's largest conglomerates, have been calling for these restrictions to be eased. With the current thaw, the Indian government seems more receptive to this demand—and Trump's tariffs could tip the scale in favor of those seeking to do more business with China.

If the situation along the border remains stable, New Delhi could ease some restrictions in nonsensitive areas. It would likely prioritize sectors where Chinese companies, industrial inputs, and expertise could help India grow or, ironically, help reduce its dependence on imports from China over the long term by building domestic capacity. Policymakers could permit Chinese involvement in areas where it could help create jobs, improve India's manufacturing and technological capabilities, better integrate India into global supply chains, and boost Indian exports. New Delhi could condition this market access by requiring those Chinese companies seeking to do business in India to form a joint venture with a local company or provide technical assistance or to transfer technology to their Indian counterparts (much as Beijing has required of foreign firms seeking to do business in China). To be sure, India will likely continue to exclude Chinese entities from sensitive sectors, including critical physical and digital infrastructure such as telecommunications, strategic technologies such as space and nuclear energy, and those that would allow China to own or transfer vast quantities of data relating to Indian citizens.

There is a dilemma here for both countries. For New Delhi, repairing economic ties with China could contribute to economic growth but also lead to greater vulnerability and dependence. Beijing, for its part, wants access to the largest market in the global South as it seeks to diversify away from Western markets. But in the process, it could end up strengthening a strategic and economic competitor.

This dilemma reflects the fact that, whatever they might say at summits, the two countries still see each other as rivals. And their differences persist. The Indian chief of defense staff recently reiterated that the unresolved border dispute with China remains India's primary security challenge. Chinese and Indian troops have not gone back to their pre-2020 deployments. Beijing still wants to keep the border issue separate from the broader relationship, whereas New Delhi sees a stable border as the necessary basis for normal ties.

Other bilateral and regional problems also bedevil the relationship. India's trade deficit with China has only increased in the last few years. And Beijing has demonstrated that it is willing to weaponize New Delhi's dependence and to try to stymie India's manufacturing and infrastructure ambitions: China restricted the export to India of rare-earth magnets and fertilizers in 2024 and 2025, the supply to India of tunnel-boring machines produced by a German company in a Chinese manufacturing facility, and the travel of technical experts from China to Apple's partner factories in India. It has also announced a massive dam project on the Yarlung Tsangpo (which India calls the Brahmaputra River) that could adversely affect India and Bangladesh, which are downstream.

This year, in May, China also played a significant, albeit behind-the-scenes, role in major clashes between India and Pakistan. Beijing backed Islamabad with real-time intelligence and information operations; one former Indian ambassador to Beijing labeled China's support “battlefield collusion.” China also continues to be Pakistan's most consequential supplier of military equipment, including, most recently, another submarine.



Thanks to these developments and to India's long-simmering mistrust of China, New Delhi has not been as warm or as willing to accommodate China as Chinese officials might have hoped. Ahead of the Modi-Xi meeting, India declined to confirm China's claim that Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar affirmed to Wang Yi during their August meeting that “Taiwan is part of China.” Instead, Indian officials insisted that they would maintain economic, technological, and cultural ties with Taiwan. An upset Beijing then declared this an attempt to “undermine China's sovereignty on the Taiwan question and impede the improvement of China-India relations.” During the visit of Philippine President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr., in early August and Modi's subsequent trip to Tokyo in late August, India also did not hold back in reiterating its position on the South China Sea and East China Sea, where Chinese maritime claims and military maneuvers have rankled neighboring states. Both of those diplomatic exchanges—and the first joint sail in the South China Sea by the Indian and Philippine navies—also indicate that India continues to seek to balance China by strengthening ties with other states in East Asia and Southeast Asia.

India has also been reluctant to support or join Chinese efforts to build an anti-Western bloc. Modi's attendance at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit received considerable attention, but what he did not do drew less attention. He pointedly did not revive his trilateral meetings with the leaders of China and Russia, which were held regularly before 2019, despite Beijing and Moscow's desire to do so. He did not attend Xi's victory parade in Beijing. And he did not, unlike Xi and Putin, participate in Brazil's emergency virtual BRICS summit to discuss U.S. tariffs, leaving that task to Jaishankar.

India has little desire to cede ground or make substantial concessions to China. Two elements of Trump's approach, however, are shaping the debate in India about the right balance in the country's foreign relations—and could very well shape India's choices. First, Trump is bluntly using the very partnership that previous administrations—including his own—have built as coercive leverage to pressure India to change both foreign and economic policy. Second, he has taken a more accommodating stance toward Xi and caused a great deal of uncertainty in India about the direction of U.S.-Chinese relations.

India moved to stabilize ties with China in 2024 in part because it did not know in which direction the next U.S. president would take the country's China policy. The Trump administration's tariffs against India—and the prospect of a Trump-Xi summit—only increased that impetus and the urgency as Modi headed into talks with Xi in Tianjin. But with Washington pressuring New Delhi and holding back on countering China, Modi found himself in a weaker position than he was in last year, when the Biden administration maintained a clear interest in partnering with India, in part to compete with China.



A U.S.-Chinese détente, even if temporary, would not only change the balance of leverage between India and China in negotiations but also complicate India's strategic environment. If the current chill in India's relations with the United States persists, India will face a scenario it has not experienced for a while: a fractious relationship with the United States while Washington pulls back from full-on strategic competition with Beijing and draws closer to Islamabad. Even though India is much stronger today than it was in the past, it fears that in such a scenario China would be tempted to press India harder—for instance, by attempting further incursions at the border. To avert that, there will be calls in India to hedge further with China even if it's on suboptimal terms, such as by making certain economic concessions, holding back on cooperation with other partners that China might find threatening, or not standing up to instances of Chinese assertiveness along the border.

This is not just a hypothetical future concern. Trump's approaches to China and India have already strengthened the hands of those in India making the case for greater openness to China. India's largest corporations, for instance, are exploring joint ventures with Chinese companies and seeking more imports from China. Beyond the medium-to-long-term impact on who does business with India, such activity could eventually expand the constituencies in India that want greater accommodation with China.

At the same time, Trump is weakening the hands of those in India who advocate for closer ties to the United States. New Delhi's and Washington's shared interests in countering Beijing deepened their partnership. It incentivized both countries to overcome historical baggage, manage differences, and cooperate in unprecedented ways in terms of defense, economic security, and technology.

But today, critics of that cooperation in India are arguing that Trump does not seem interested in competition with China. Moreover, those critics argue, a United States that is weaponizing interdependence and trying to coerce India is behaving, well, just like China. Even supporters of the relationship, such as Jaishankar, note that India needs to guard against not just overdependence on sources of supply (notably, China) but also against sources of demand (notably, the United States). This reflects a shift: instead of being understood as part of the solution to India's China problem, the United States is fast becoming perceived as a problem in its own right.

And if that perception holds—and policies follow from it—it will be a problem for the United States. Persisting tensions with the United States will affect India's strategic, economic, and technology choices. Figures both within and outside the Indian government will urge leaders to do less with an unreliable United States and to find alternative security partners and markets, as well as sources of capital, defense equipment, technology, commodities, and know-how. This will make India a less friendly environment for American businesses and technology firms and a less willing partner for the U.S. government, particularly in the defense, economic security, and technology domains, where India had started cooperating with the United States in ways it had not before.

In their recent piece for Foreign Affairs, Kurt Campbell and Jake Sullivan made the case that American investment in India was not based on altruism but on interests, including the U.S. ability to compete with and deter China. Were India aligned with the United States, it would complicate China's calculations. Were India and the United States at odds with each other, though, both countries would have a weaker hand to play, especially when it comes to China.

New Delhi realizes that it will have less leverage with Beijing and a tougher time securing itself, growing economically, innovating, and ensuring an Asia not dominated by China if U.S.-Indian ties remain fraught. This is why it continues to seek an agreement with the Trump administration. If Washington does not reciprocate and instead persists in pressuring India, however, New Delhi over time will find a different balance in its foreign policy, and that new balance will invariably be less favorable to the United States.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

DON GRAVES, JR., was U.S. Deputy Secretary of Commerce from 2021 to 2025.

AROOP MUKHARJI was Senior Adviser for Economic and National Security to the Deputy Secretary at the U.S. Department of Commerce from 2022 to 2024. The views expressed here are his own.

 How Profit Seeking Distorts American Policymaking

 Don Graves, Jr., and Aroop Mukharji

Until recently, few policy tools united Democrats and Republicans like export controls. Restrictions on the spread of dual-use U.S. technology such as semiconductors became the policy of choice in the tech race against China and as a means of punishing Russia for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In the wrong hands, semiconductors and certain other U.S. technologies can present national security risks. Politicians might have debated the details, but there was broad bipartisan agreement that the U.S. government should regulate the movement of these technologies.

The Trump administration has also embraced the use of export controls—but it has added a twist. In August, the administration brokered a revenue-sharing deal with Nvidia, a U.S. company that designs semiconductor chips used to power artificial intelligence. In exchange for export control licenses to sell its H20 chip to China, the company will now give 15 percent of its revenue from those sales to the U.S. government. Previously, the U.S. government reviewed license applications to ensure transactions did not present unacceptable risks. This time, the administration replaced that process with a price tag, prioritizing side payments to the government over security interests.

Although Beijing banned Chinese companies from buying Nvidia's chips last week, after accusing the company of violating antimonopoly laws, the Trump administration's deal is part of a worrying trend: the monetization of national security. Instead of treating security as an indivisible, priceless ideal—similar to free and fair elections, free speech, or freedom of religion—the administration is treating U.S. national security as if it were a portfolio of divisible, priceable assets. What once was security is now securities. Worse, the prices appear to be negotiable: the president revealed in a press conference that the administration had sought a 20 percent cut of Nvidia's sales but settled for 15.

Reducing national security to dollars and cents does not just distort the term's meaning; it also makes the United States less secure. Replacing licenses with revenue-sharing deals, making certain types of direct investments, and squeezing U.S. allies and partners may all help fill U.S. government coffers. But policies designed to maximize short-term gain can create new security problems and leave the old ones unsolved. They will enable U.S. technology to more easily reach American adversaries, cost the U.S. government oversight over taxpayer money, and sacrifice Washington's ability to shape the world around it.

Avoiding these dangers and reducing the U.S. economy's exposure to risk requires a careful, farsighted strategy that recognizes the reality of the United States' place in today's world. True economic security will remain out of reach as long as the government is run as a business, its policy levers and relationships priced, bundled, and repriced, available to be bought and sold.

Economic concerns were fundamental to national security when the term was first introduced in national debate, about a century ago. As the historians Peter Roady and Andrew Preston have recently documented, during his 1932 election campaign and following presidential term, Franklin Roosevelt deliberately defined the phrase to capture risks to domestic economic well-being. In his second fireside chat in 1933, Roosevelt argued that economic struggle led to “incalculable” social harm and a “loss of that sense of security.” A new domestic economic program was “imperative to our national security,” he declared, later summarizing, “Freedom from fear is eternally linked with freedom from want.”

Roosevelt's original interpretation of national security later gave way to a more militarized, more expansive conception, reinforced by the interests of a growing arms industry and the rise of the modern military-industrial complex. It came to encompass every corner of the world. This focus on military and ideological competition reigned supreme into the early years of the twenty-first century, even as Washington began paying greater attention to the financial tools it could use to contain threats from terrorist groups and rogue states after the 9/11 attacks.

In the 2010s and early 2020s, Roosevelt's vision of the economic and domestic dimensions of national security made a bipartisan comeback. The second line of the Obama administration's 2015 National Security Strategy affirmed that “America's growing economic strength is the foundation of our national security.” In his first term, Trump championed the same idea. “For the first time,” he remarked on releasing his 2017 National Security Strategy, “American strategy recognizes that economic security is national security.”



Four years later, President Joe Biden's 2021 interim national security guidance repeated the same mantra: “Economic security is national security.” Biden's Department of Commerce played a greater role in national security policy than anyone in government could remember, not just with export controls but also in work on supply chains, cybersecurity, information and communication technology, climate change, investment security, law enforcement, commercial diplomacy, standards development, patents, domestic investment, and even commercial space policy. There was substantial bipartisan alignment on many of these issues. Republicans were especially supportive of the department's export control policies, and in late 2023, Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis proposed establishing a federal office of economic security and competition—with a mandate similar to that of new offices the Biden administration had created earlier that year, including the Commerce Department's Supply Chain Center and the Office of Economic Security and Emerging Technology, part of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

It is not simply that economic, technology, and trade policy became more appealing arrows in the national security quiver. That did happen. But more significantly, on a philosophical level, leading Democrats and Republicans agreed that security itself meant much more than an absence of physical attack. It also meant reducing economic struggle and risk. They saw economic security as a domestic issue as much as an international one. The erosion of strategic U.S. industries and the loss of technological leadership, for instance, could leave the United States vulnerable to foreign actors who might weaponize trade dependencies. The supply chain disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic showed just how easily the country could lose access to critical goods. The first Trump administration's relentless focus on manufacturing domestically to rely less on others and its concern that Huawei and TikTok could give the Chinese government access to American data, furthermore, continued into the Biden administration. With notable exceptions, such as export controls, Democratic and Republican policy solutions were not always the same, but everyone largely agreed on what the problem was.

The second Trump administration is challenging this consensus. Traditionally, national security has been about reducing threats; now, the administration seeks to profit from them, ostensibly in the eventual hope of cutting taxes for the public benefit. The H20 chip deal with Nvidia is one way it has done this, by allowing a company whose business with China presents a national security threat to buy off that risk. Trump has said that H20 chips are “obsolete” products that China “already has,” suggesting that selling them presents no risk to the United States. The point is moot in this case if Beijing keeps a ban on Nvidia's chips in place. But in principle, a riskless export control license is an oxymoron; licenses are required only when the government has identified a risk. It did so for the H20 chip just a few months ago, in April. This is the reason paying for export control licenses is prohibited under U.S. law (Title 50 of the U.S. Code), to prevent a situation in which financial gain takes precedence over national security concerns. When export controls are about money rather than security standards, U.S. technology will easily reach malign actors.

Possible legal complications, however, have not stopped the Trump administration from pursuing this kind of arrangement. It has already reached a deal with another technology company, AMD, to give the U.S. government 15 percent of its revenue from selling its MI308 processors in China—something Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (whose department does not oversee dual-use export controls) called a “beta test.”

The administration could continue to replicate this model, and not just in export control cases. It could, for example, try to generate cash for the federal government by accepting payment in exchange for the approval of foreign direct investment in U.S. companies, wiping away potential national security concerns for the right price. If an investment presents any kind of concern, such as data security, however, pretending the problem does not exist because someone has agreed to pay the government is not a real solution. And left unresolved, a national security problem will only fester.

The monetization of national security has not been limited to revenue-sharing deals. The administration is also exploring direct investment in U.S. companies. Most notably, the government announced in August that it was purchasing a ten percent stake (roughly $8.9 billion) in Intel, the United States' largest semiconductor manufacturer. Unlike revenue-sharing deals, direct investment is unusual but not unprecedented. There can be legitimate reasons for the government to invest in a company that is critical to national security and needs help. For instance, a struggling company that faces closure or a foreign takeover might need both cash and strategic guidance. Or a startup that is not yet generating revenue may need public investment when private capital is not an option. But making money should not be the primary goal—a single company's payouts to the government should not be prioritized above nationwide security interests.



The Intel deal illustrates this risk. Federal money was already promised to Intel through grants from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act; this money came with protections attached to ensure it was used to advance the public interest. The largest grant supported manufacturing projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon, and the company was obligated to report on project milestones and follow national security guardrails that, among other things, limited its activities with foreign countries of concern. Also embedded in the grant program was a provision to return money to taxpayers in the case of unanticipated profits, called “upside sharing.”

But instead of continuing to disburse grant money and keeping these protections in place, the U.S. government opted for equity. This meant more cash up front for Intel and potentially more future revenue for the federal government but—critically—a significant loss of oversight of taxpayer dollars. Intel may decide to use those dollars in ways that support national security interests. Or it may not.

Finally, the administration has monetized national security through its approach to U.S. military support and foreign aid, helping others if it brings a financial return. “Taiwan should pay us for defense,” the then candidate Trump said in 2024. “You know, we're no different than an insurance company.” Shortly after Trump's election, Taiwan pledged to increase its spending on U.S. weapons; in the early months of his presidency, Trump's frequent complaints about allied free-riding pressured others to do the same. The administration followed a similar mercenary logic in pursuing a critical minerals deal with Ukraine in exchange for Washington's continued support for Kyiv's war effort and in canceling U.S. foreign aid across the globe. To replace a “charity-based model” of development assistance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote in July, the administration would instead seek investment opportunities that produce “a multiplier effect” that benefits the private sector.

Yet likening aid to an insurance policy or a market venture misses the greatest strategic value of supporting others. Take development aid. Aside from the compelling morality of alleviating human suffering, this aid can provide a bulwark against foreign manipulation, the emergence of terrorist havens, the growth of black markets, and other security threats that arise from chronic underdevelopment and economic struggle. Those interests, like so many others—nuclear nonproliferation, maintaining robust alliances, supporting democracy—have little to do with immediate financial returns.

To call the Trump administration's approach to national security transactionalism misses the bigger point. Transactionalism assumes an exchange, tit for tat. But the administration instead is trading an intangible for a tangible: security interests for cold, hard cash. In doing so, it betrays a fundamentally different view of what national security is—one that suggests security can be priced at all.

At best, the administration's pursuit of profit distracts Washington from solving national security concerns; at worst, it deepens those threats. Monetization can even create new vulnerabilities and sources of insecurity by incentivizing affluent players to join the game. Take, for instance, Qatar's gift of a gleaming $400 million airplane to transport the U.S. president. In the administration's eagerness to accept a golden egg, it has created a golden espionage opportunity by inviting foreign surveillance.

The core problem with monetizing national security interests is that it contradicts the basic principles of economic security. This subset of national security includes protecting the U.S. economy, critical infrastructure, and American well-being; building national resilience to disruptions; and generally ensuring the safe and stable flourishing of American society. Truly advancing economic security requires that policymakers navigate tradeoffs, recognize that other countries hold leverage, engage partners, and play the long game.

Maintaining a bird's-eye view of tradeoffs and tensions in economic security policy is essential to making wise decisions. Economic actions taken on behalf of national security, such as export controls, could have the unintended effect of limiting economic growth and innovation. Likewise, some actions taken in the pursuit of economic growth and innovation, such as export promotion and scientific collaboration, may undermine national security if those exports and research products are used to threaten Americans. The pitfall to avoid is creating new sources of insecurity or areas of misunderstanding. An action to resolve one risk should not create an even greater risk. For instance, the Trump administration's early approach to tariffs—massive, punitive, and blunt—roiled the market and created economic uncertainty that even the president could not stomach. More narrowly targeted trade arrangements would help minimize adverse effects on American consumers, producers, and investors. They would also ensure the clarity, transparency, and predictability that CEOs and U.S. allies and partners crave.



Successful economic security policies also appreciate balance-of-power politics. The United States does not exist in a unipolar world, controlling supply chains and economic chokepoints. The more it acts as if it does, such as through coercive tariffs, the more other countries will balance against it. Frustrations with U.S. tariff policies have already breathed new life into the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, an economic and security body that encompasses more than 40 percent of the world's population and aspires to be a strategic counterweight to the United States' presence in Asia. More balancing may follow suit.

A smarter approach would engage partners. This is not just about doing good; it is strategic. Building trusted supply chains, protecting data, and executing export controls, for instance, all rely on coordination with international partners and, perhaps more important, with industry. Without coordination, rules are weaker, evasion is easier, and law enforcement is harder. True cooperation is not a slipshod, made-for-TV deal. It is accomplished through regular, deliberative bureaucratic conversations and adherence to process. By genuinely seeking input from its partners, the United States can avoid the kind of harmful backlash to its policies that ultimately undermines U.S. influence.

Finally, policymakers must recognize that economic security is a long game. Economic tools such as export promotion to build trusted supply chains tend to take years to work. Yet many national security professionals mistakenly assume that they will see the same immediate results as decisive military action. This rarely happens; it is always easier to destroy than it is to build. Economic policy has the most to offer over the long term, in its potential to transform societies. This is what makes development aid—which the Trump administration has slashed as a supposed cost-saving measure—so valuable. Development, of course, cannot happen overnight. And it is not always clear what problem, or malign actor, the aid is warding off. But helping build a healthier and more prosperous world reduces the chances of many bad outcomes.

The United States' security challenges are becoming only more complex, and policymakers are still figuring out how best to address them using the economic tools at their disposal. Yet one guiding principle is clear: a democratic government does not exist to enrich itself.National security policy, therefore, should not seek profits or involve opportunistic bonus payments. The U.S. government's national security responsibility is to ensure national security. That is it.

            As Aldi expands across the United States, so does its name recognition. Now, that name will be stamped on all of its own products. 



            Aldi announced Wednesday sweeping changes across its product portfolio, drastically reducing the number of in-house brands from about 90 to 26 and consolidating them under a unified “The Aldi Brand” label. The store's more popular labels — like Clancy's and Simply Nature — remain but will have “An Aldi Original” title added to their packaging.
    


            The changes are in response to customer feedback, according to Scott Patton, Aldi's chief commercial officer. He told CNN that customers “often refer to all of the Aldi products as the ‘Aldi brand,' so we made it a little bit easier for customers to talk about them.”
    


            Aldi, which started in Germany, is rapidly expanding across the US with about 2,570 locations already and plans to open an additional 200 by the end of the year. The discount grocer has found success thanks to a plethora of private labels, which account for 90% of its selection, sold at prices usually marked below name brands.
    


            Private labels have been resonating with consumers in recent years not just because of cost, but also as they've improved in quality and design. Once known for dowdy packaging and perhaps questionable tastes or ingredients, the products now compete with national name brands, sparking a shakeup among major food companies.
    


            National chains are investing heavily in their private labels as spending from consumers on store brands hit a record-breaking $271 billion in 2024, outpacing the growth of national brands.
    


            Last year, Amazon launched Saver, a no-frills lineup of household staples mostly priced under $5. Whole Foods Market has said sales of its home-grown products has soared 50% since 2019. Kroger recently said it plans to add 900 more products to its private label lineup.
    


            “Shoppers aren't willing to try cheaper alternatives, they're seeking them out,” said Greg Petro, CEO of First Insight, a retail analysis firm. “When a private label product matches the look, feel, and quality of a premium brand at a lower price, it's seen as a smart choice rather than a compromise.”
    


            Petro told CNN that Aldi has been a big benefactor of this trend since it's made shopping “both affordable and surprisingly fun,” a nod to the chain's viral totes that often sell out.
    


            “Aldi has built a model that delivers quality goods at consistently low prices — something shoppers value more than ever amid inflation and economic uncertainty,” he said. “Its heavy investment in private label products keeps costs down while still competing directly with national brands on quality.”
    


            Aldi is privately held and doesn't reveal financial earnings. But cost-conscious customers appear to be attracted to the brand, with visits per location in 2025 up 1.6% year-over-year and a staggering 26.7% compared to 2022, according to Placer.ai, a firm that traffics foot traffic.
    


            With Aldi cultivating an almost cult-like fandom for its products, it was careful not to nix any brands that had a passionate following. Some brand names that were scrapped include its Baker's Corner collection of flour and baking soda, as well as canned items such as Dakota's Pride beans — both of which will be folded into “The Aldi Brand” label.
    


            “We asked customers, ‘What are areas where brands are important?' and ‘Where are areas where brands aren't?'” said Kristy Reitz, Aldi's director of brand and design.
    


            “Brands aren't a big driver” for sales of fresh or commodity-based items, she said.
    


Aldi's ‘aisle of shame' is a middle row of goodies that have nothing to do with groceries. Shoppers are huge fans of it



            Other products are taking on their fan-given nickname, such as Kirkwood frozen chicken items, which will be called “Red Bag Chicken,” Reitz said.
    


            The refreshed packaging, which boosts brighter and bolder colors, has clearer product descriptions. Shoppers will begin seeing them soon, but it will take a few years to complete.
    


            Although the packaging will change, Aldi should clarify to customers that what's inside will stay the same, one expert said.
    


            “Aldi has created one of the best assortments of ‘own brands' food products. With this design change they may risk confusing shoppers who may think the recipe inside the package has changed as well,” Phil Lempert, editor of Supermarket Guru, told CNN.
    


            He added that the chain has “done an exceptional job in marketing their brands to shoppers, I hope this change doesn't distract their focus.”
    


            The refresh comes as Aldi is embroiled in a lawsuit with snack giant Mondelez International, which alleges that some of the grocery chain's snack packaging “blatantly copies” its packaging of Oreo, Chips Ahoy and other products. Aldi doesn't comment on pending litigation.
    


            Lempert wonders if the reason behind Aldi's portfolio change was because of “pressures from (consumer packaged goods) companies who believe the Aldi packaging and branding was too similar to their brands and confusing consumers.”
    


            Aldi's designs are “created to look and feel a lot like national brands,” according to First Insight's Petro. The firm's research found that 71% of consumers surveyed believe they could recognize a private label when shopping, but 72% failed to do so when shown side-by-side images of store and national brands.
    


            “For Aldi, this blurring of lines works to its advantage,” he said. “By offering private label products that look and feel like national brands, but at lower prices, Aldi builds trust and reinforces its promise of delivering value to customers.”
    


            Even with all the changes, Aldi's Patton reiterated the food itself isn't changing.
    


             “It might look different on the outside, but the product on the inside is still going to be what our customers know and love,” he confirmed.

            A man in his forties has been arrested in connection to a cyber attack that knocked out automatic check-in systems at some of Europe's busiest airports last week.
    


            The man, who was arrested in West Sussex, England, on Tuesday evening, was detained on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences, the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) said in a statement shared with CNN. He has been released on conditional bail.
    


            “Although this arrest is a positive step, the investigation into this incident is in its early stages and remains ongoing,” Paul Foster, head of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit, said in the statement,
    


            “Cybercrime is a persistent global threat that continues to cause significant disruption to the UK. Alongside our partners here and overseas, the NCA is committed to reducing that threat in order to protect the British public,” he added.
    


            Last Friday, aviation company Collins Aerospace was targeted in the cyber attack, sparking disruption for passengers who were set to depart from cities including London, Brussels, Berlin and Dublin.
    


            Brussels Airport used iPads and laptops to check passengers in online, while a passenger at Berlin Brandenburg Airport told Reuters that travelers were being given handwritten boarding passes.
    


            In a statement on Wednesday morning, Berlin's airport said disruption was continuing.
    


            “Given that check-in and boarding are still largely manual, longer processing times, delays, and cancellations by airlines may continue today despite the mobilization of all available resources,” the airport said, adding that it is working on “alternative solutions to minimize the impact” of the cyberattack on passengers.

            If there's a metaphor that epitomizes President Donald Trump's attempts to consolidate power, it's the boiling frog.
    


            Through a steadily escalating barrage of provocations, he challenges people to keep paying attention and (most importantly) challenges Republicans to object. GOP lawmakers often let it go, and over time the president significantly moves the line – to the point where things that would once have been unthinkable become normalized. It's been a very successful political strategy.
    


            The problem comes when Trump tries to move that line too quickly.
    


            The past two weeks may fall in that category.
    


            First came Attorney General Pam Bondi's sudden suggestion, which she later tried to walk back, that the government would prosecute hate speech – comments Trump has suggested he aligned with and that drew almost universal condemnation, even from some MAGA voices. Then came the Federal Communications Commission's briefly successful pressure campaign to get ABC's Jimmy Kimmel taken off the air, which has drawn derision from some prominent Republican senators. Then came Trump's strongest comments to date signaling he'll put his finger on the scales of justice to target his foes.
    


            In each case, it's looking like the president is risking not getting what he wants – and, in the process, reinforcing just how much he's overreached.
    


            Kimmel's return to television Tuesday night was a significant moment. But it doesn't mean the saga is over. The fact that FCC Chairman Brendan Carr had at least momentary success in getting Kimmel suspended is significant. And Trump ramped up his attacks on both Kimmel and ABC late Tuesday night, seeming to threaten legal action. “I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative,” he wrote on Truth Social, alluding to a past settlement in a defamation suit.
    


            But the Kimmel episode – combined with the kerfuffle over Bondi's initial hate speech comments – appears to have awakened free speech-conscious portions of the GOP.
    


            Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas led the way Friday by calling Carr's pressure “dangerous as hell,” likening it to mob tactics and warning it would blow back on Republicans when Democrats are in charge. Since then, GOP senators including Kentucky's Rand Paul, Pennsylvania's David McCormick, Indiana's Todd Young and Kentucky's Mitch McConnell have also objected.
    


            That this whole effort might have been a bridge too far shouldn't be too surprising. A Pew Research Center poll last year showed 6 in 10 Republican-leaning voters said the US government should have no role in policing false information online, for example. Republicans have prided themselves on being anti-censorship in recent years.
    


            All of which could leave the administration with some difficult choices. Does it keep up the pressure on ABC and keep wielding the FCC in extraordinary ways – and in ways even Trump-friendly GOP senators are now suggesting they oppose? Or does the administration scale it back? So far, the president's social media post on the night of Kimmel's return would suggest the former.
    


            Trump has even floated stripping networks that are too critical of him of their broadcast licenses. But his power appears limited. And even though a pair of local broadcasters have signaled they will continue preempting Kimmel's program, they could be limited in their ability to do it.
    


            Trump has been pushing the line on free speech rights for some time, including by targeting American flag-burning and pro-Palestinian protesters, as well as by seeming to use the leverage of government power to get companies to settle defamation lawsuits with him.
    


            If anything, the renewed debate over free speech appears to have distilled the issue into something simpler for people to understand – and to object to.
    


            Trump's other big line-pushing moment in recent days has been his rather blatant effort to push the government to bring criminal charges against his political foes.
    


            Trump on Friday pushed out the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert, over his failure to charge New York Attorney General Letitia James over still tenuous claims of mortgage fraud. He followed that up Saturday by publicly pleading with Attorney General Pam Bondi to get moving on targeting his political foes.
    


            This is Trump finally doing the thing he has flirted with for a very long time.
    


            There was the firing of James Comey in 2017 and Trump's effort to pressure his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, over his failure to exercise more control over the Russia investigation. Then there were Trump's clashes with then-Attorney General William Barr over the same issue. (Barr once felt compelled to say publicly that Trump remarking on cases was making it “impossible” to do his job.)
    


            Where this pressure differs is how overt it is. Trump has made clear he just wants charges, and he's prepared to use the tools at his disposal to make them happen.
    


            But there's a case to be made that that could work against Trump – both politically and practically.
    


            On the political front, this is something that even many Republicans have suggested was beyond the pale and unthinkable. They rationalized the firing of Comey as it being Trump's prerogative and his commentary on ongoing cases as Trump being Trump. But there's really no spinning this as anything other than the president putting pressure on his Justice Department to bring charges against his perceived political enemies.
    


            It also flies in the face of how both the vast majority of Americans and about half of Republicans have felt about the issue. A CNN poll last year showed 7 in 10 Americans and 48% of Republican-leaning voters said it was not okay for Trump to try and direct the Justice Department to investigate his rivals.
    


            Perhaps even more telling, it's something most Trump supporters didn't even think he would do. A CNN poll early this year showed 53% of Trump supporters didn't believe he would ever attempt it, which suggests they viewed it as a severe action.
    


            And practically speaking, it's quite possible Trump's overt pressure will actually make prosecuting his foes harder.
    


            The National Review's Andrew McCarthy has a good piece on this. He points out that judges could view Trump's pressure as reason to dismiss the cases on selective-prosecution grounds. He suggests it could also jeopardize grand juries' willingness to indict, which has already been an issue with the Trump DOJ's zealous charges during his federal crackdown in DC.
    


            The question of Trump's potential political influence in these cases was already out there given his past commentary and pressure on the DOJ; but now it's a lot easier to trace potential indictments to politics. If someone who's been publicly targeted by Trump is indicted, the question will instantly be whether this was ordered by him.

            Surrounding our solar system is a natural and enigmatic cosmic shield called the heliosphere — and a new mission has launched to help astronomers better understand it.
    


            Created by the solar wind, a constant flow of charged particles that stream away from the sun, the heliosphere acts as an enormous bubble that protects the planets in our solar system from cosmic radiation permeating the Milky Way, our home galaxy.
    


            In addition to Earth's protective magnetic field, the heliosphere plays a major role in why life is possible on our planet — and how it perhaps once existed on others such as Mars.
    


            Over half a dozen missions   have contributed to how astronomers understand the heliosphere, and two enduring spacecraft, the Voyager probes, have collected key data after exiting the heliosphere to explore interstellar space.
    


            But the new IMAP, or Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe, mission is designed to investigate how the sun forms its solar wind, and how that solar wind interacts with interstellar space at the boundary of the heliosphere, which begins at a range three times the distance between Earth and Pluto, according to NASA.
    


            The spacecraft's 10 instruments will also fill gaps in the existing map of the heliosphere, pieced together from data collected by previous missions, and help further explain how the heliosphere largely shields our solar system from damaging cosmic rays, the most highly energetic particles in the universe.
    


            Along with two other space weather missions that lifted off aboard the same rocket on Wednesday, IMAP will help scientists better predict when solar storms unleashed by the sun could affect our planet. When aimed at Earth, harsh radiation from the storms, also known as space weather, can pose risks to astronauts on the International Space Station as well as interfere with communications, the electric power grid, navigation, and radio and satellite operations.
    


            “This next set of missions is the ultimate cosmic carpool,” said Dr. Joe Westlake, director of NASA's Heliophysics Division, during a news conference on Sunday. “They will provide unprecedented insight into space weather. Every human on Earth, as well as nearly every system involved in space exploration and human needs, is affected by space weather.”
    


            The heliosphere was first theorized by multiple scientists investigating the concept of cosmic rays and the solar wind in the late 1950s, according to NASA. They believed the sun provided a web of magnetic fields and solar wind that created a boundary surrounding Earth and the rest of the solar system.
    


Mariner 2, the first successful mission to another planet that performed a flyby of Venus in 1962, also was the first to measure the solar wind, proving its existence. Direct measurements taken by the Pioneer 10 and 11 missions in the 1970s, as well as the Voyager probes, provided further proof of the heliosphere.
    


            Scientists are eager to know what the boundaries of the heliosphere look like, something that the Voyager probes have offered tantalizing glimpses of in the past. They are the only two spacecraft to cross the heliosphere.
    


            Voyager 1 reached the heliosphere boundary in 2012, while the slower Voyager 2 crossed the boundary in 2018, providing snapshots in two specific locations. The information collected by these probes is helping scientists learn about the heliosphere's cometlike shape.
    


            The IBEX, or Interstellar Boundary Explorer, satellite has been mapping the heliosphere since launching in 2008. But IMAP can explore and map the boundaries of the heliosphere like never before because it has instruments with faster imaging that are capable of 30 times higher resolution.
    


            Once it reaches an orbit about 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth in about three months, IMAP will also capture observations of the solar wind in real time and measure particles that travel from the sun, study the heliosphere's boundary between 6 billion and 9 billion miles (9.7 billion to 14.5 billion kilometers) away, and even collect data from interstellar space.
    


            Predominately, IMAP will measure energetic neutral atoms, called ENAs, or uncharged particles that form when an energetic charged ion collides with a slow-moving neutral atom. The process that forms these particles, found wherever there is plasma, or charged gas, in space, also occurs throughout the heliosphere and along its boundary. IMAP will rely on tracking these particles to create a more complete map of the heliosphere, according to NASA.
    


            The particles travel in a straight line, unaffected by magnetic fields because they are not charged, so IMAP can collect ENAs near Earth and trace them to their origins, like the otherwise invisible boundaries of the heliosphere, according to NASA.
    


            “IMAP is going to make incredibly detailed pictures that will evolve over time of that interaction region,” said Dr. David McComas, IMAP's principal investigator and an astrophysicist at Princeton University. “It will be able to understand what the shielding is, how the shielding works and what it looks like.”
    


            McComas added that our solar system is not alone in having something like a heliosphere, and bright astrospheres  have been spotted around other stars.
    


            IMAP launched alongside NASA's Carruthers Geocorona Observatory and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's SWFO-L1, or Space Weather Follow On-Lagrange 1, on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday at 7:30 a.m. ET. NASA streamed the launch live on YouTube.
    


            The Carruthers Geocorona Observatory is a small satellite that will be dedicated to observing the exosphere, or Earth's outermost atmospheric layer. The Carruthers mission will capture images of the region's faint ultraviolet glow, called the geocorona, to help answer questions about the exosphere's shape, size and density.
    


            The mission is named for Dr. George Carruthers, who developed an ultraviolet camera as the first moon-based observatory that was placed during the Apollo 16 mission. The camera, still in place in the Descartes highland region on the moon, photographed Earth in ultraviolet light and captured the first image of the exosphere in 1972.
    


            The Carruthers mission will measure changes and the effects of space weather once it reaches Earth, given that the exosphere marks a transitional boundary between Earth and space.
    


            Meanwhile, the SWFO-L1 mission is intended to act as a solar storm detector, providing early warnings to protect astronauts in low-Earth orbit and satellites that provide critical communications on Earth. It's a tool that will be even more necessary as astronauts venture farther into deep space.
    


            “I think we're getting better…but a really solid forecast, I think, is still something that we're striving for,” said Mark Clampin, acting deputy associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, at a news conference for the agency's upcoming Artemis II mission around the moon. “And obviously the missions that we're putting up now will give us much better insight into not just the one piece of the problem, but the whole problem, from what's happening on the sun to how that then propagates out from the sun, and whether it becomes a real problem or not.”
    


Two billionaires have very different — and equally wild — visions of a future in space. Is either possible?



            The satellite's compact coronagraph telescope will monitor the sun for activity and measure the solar wind, providing a constant stream of data to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. Images of solar storms taken by the satellite can be sent to the center within 30 minutes, while other current missions, like NASA and the European Space Agency's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, launched in 1995, can take up to eight hours.
    


            “SWFO-L1's essential data is our lifeline for keeping the lights on, planes flying and satellites safe, ensuring that America is ready for what the sun sends our way ,” said Clinton Wallace, director of NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center.

WASHINGTON (AP) — When President Donald Trump's administration announced it would repurpose an old, generic drug as a new treatment for autism, it came as a surprise to many experts — including the physician who suggested the idea to the nation's top health officials.

Dr. Richard Frye told The Associated Press that he'd been talking with federal regulators about developing his own customized version of the drug for children with autism, assuming more research would be required.

“So we were kinda surprised that they were just approving it right out of the gate without more studies or anything,” said Frye, an Arizona-based child neurologist who has a book and online education business focused on the experimental treatment.

It's another example of the haphazard rollout of the Trump administration's Monday announcement on autism, which critics say has elevated an unproven drug that needs far more study before being approved as a credible treatment for the complex brain disease.

A spokesperson for the Republican administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday morning.

The nation's leading autism groups and researchers quickly distanced themselves from the decision on leucovorin, a derivative of vitamin B, calling the studies supporting its use “very weak” and ”very small.”

“We have nothing resembling even moderate evidence that leucovorin is an effective treatment for autism symptoms,” said David Mandell, a psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania.




Mandell and other researchers say the evidence suggests autism is mostly rooted in genetics, with input from other factors, including the age of the child's father.

Nevertheless, a growing number of doctors are prescribing the medication, repurposing versions used for chemotherapy or ordering new formulations from compounding pharmacies.

Many researchers agree the drug warrants additional study, particularly for patients with a deficiency of folate, or vitamin B9, in the brain that may play a role in autism. But for now, they say, it should only be taken in carefully controlled clinical trials.

“We often say our job is to stay between the yellow lines,” said Dr. Lawrence Gray, a pediatric developmental specialist at Northwestern University. “When people just decide to go outside of current guidelines, then they're outside of that. And nobody knows what's going to happen out there.”

The case for leucovorin's use in autism begins with established science but quickly veers into uncertain terrain.

When metabolized, the drug turns into folate, which is essential for healthy prenatal development and is recommended before and during pregnancy. But far less is known about its role after birth.

The issue caught the attention of Frye and others more than 20 years ago, when research suggested some people with autism had low levels of folate in the brain due to antibodies blocking the vitamin's absorption.

The theory linking autism to folate levels was mostly abandoned, however, after research showed that the siblings of people with autism can also have low folates without any symptoms of the condition.

“I honestly thought this had died out as a theory for autism and was shocked to see its reemergence,” Mandell said.

In 2018, Frye and his colleagues published a study of 48 children in which those taking leucovorin performed better on several language measures than those taking a placebo.

Four small studies in other countries, including China and Iran, showed similar results, albeit using different doses, metrics and statistical analyses, which researchers say is problematic.

Frye struggled to get funding to continue within the traditional academic system.

“I decided to move out of academia to be more innovative and actually do some of this stuff,” he said. 

Earlier this year, Frye and several other researchers formed a new entity, the Autism Discovery Coalition, to pitch their work to Trump administration officials including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

“After Kennedy got in, we thought they'd hopefully be friendly to autism scientists,” he said.

An August meeting with National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya quickly led to further discussions with the Food and Drug Administration about testing a proprietary, purified version of leucovorin.

A new formulation of the decades-old drug would mean new patents, allowing Frye and his yet-to-formed drug company to charge far more than the cheap generics currently on the market.

“We have a lot of investors who are excited about leucovorin and want to do something high quality for kids with autism,” he said.

But the FDA's announcement Monday may have scuttled that plan. Instead of previewing a new version, the agency said it would simply update the label on the generic drug to mention use in boosting folate brain levels, including for patients with autism. That's expected to encourage more doctors to prescribe it and insurers to cover it.

Specialists who have spent decades treating autistic patients say it's important to proceed carefully and methodically.

Gray recalls other experimental treatments that initially looked promising only to fail in larger studies.

“Small studies often find populations that are very motivated,” Gray said. “But when those therapies are moved into larger studies, the initial positive findings often disappear.”

Among the challenges facing leucovorin: There isn't agreement about what portion of autism patients have the folate-blocking antibodies supposedly targeted by the drug.

Frye screens his patients for the antibodies using a test developed at a laboratory at the State University of New York. Like many specialty tests, it has not been reviewed by the FDA.

Gray says the only way to definitively test for the antibodies would be by extracting cranial fluid from children with autism through a spinal tap.

“That's a big limiting factor in having these large, randomized controlled trials,” Gray said.

While the Trump administration discusses fast-tracking leucovorin, interest in the drug continues to swirl online, including in forums and social media groups for parents of children with autism.

Brian Noonan, of Phoenix, found out about the drug earlier this year after asking ChatGPT for the best autism drug options for his 4-year-old son.

The FDA has never approved any drug for the underlying causes of autism, but the chatbot directed Noonan to Frye's research.

After an evaluation and confirmatory blood test, the boy started on a formulation of the drug from a compounding pharmacy in June.

Within days, Noonan says, he saw improvement in his son's ability to make eye contact and form sentences.

“He's not cured, but these are just areas of improvement,” Noonan said. “It's been a big thing for us.”

DALLAS (AP) — A shooter with a rifle opened fire from a nearby roof onto a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement location in Dallas on Wednesday, killing two detainees and wounding another before taking his own life, authorities said.

The exact motivation of the attack was not immediately known. The FBI said at a morning news conference that ammunition found at the scene contained anti-ICE messaging. The head of the agency, Kash Patel, released a photo on social media that shows a bullet containing the words “ANTI-ICE” written in what appears to be marker.

“The shooter fired indiscriminately at the ICE building, including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a release.

The detainee who survived was in critical condition at a hospital, DHS said.

Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News that no ICE agents were injured.

“We believe he was shooting at law enforcement and detainees from an apartment building,” McLaughlin said. “Detainees were among the victims of the shooting.”

The FBI said during the news conference that it was investigating the shooting as “an act of targeted violence.”

The attack is the latest public, targeted killing in the U.S. and comes two weeks after conservative leader Charlie Kirk was killed by a rifle-wielding shooter on a roof.

Officers responded to a call to assist an officer on North Stemmons Freeway around 6:40 a.m. Wednesday and determined that someone opened fire at a government building from an adjacent building, Dallas police spokesperson Officer Jonathen E. Maner said in an email.




Edwin Cardona, an immigrant from Venezuela, said he was entering the ICE building with his son for an appointment at around 6:20 a.m. when he heard gunshots.

An agent gathered people who were inside the building, took them to a more secure area and explained that there was an active shooter in the area, Cardona said.

“I was afraid for my family because my family was outside. I felt terrible because I thought something could happen to them. Thank God no,” Cardona said.

Cardona said his family was brought into the building, and they were later reunited.

The ICE facility is along Interstate 35 East, just southwest of Dallas Love Field, a large commercial airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and blocks from hotels catering to airport travelers.




Traffic cameras near the scene showed six lanes of a normally busy freeway empty, with cars and semitrailers ground to a halt on an interstate exit. Dozens of emergency vehicles were seen near the facility.

Shortly after the shooting and before officials said at least one of the victims was a detainee, Vice President JD Vance posted on the social platform X that “the obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.”

U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz from Texas continued in that direction, calling for an end to politically motivated violence.

“To every politician who is using rhetoric demonizing ICE and demonizing CPB: stop,” Cruz told reporters, referencing Customs and Border Protection.

But immediately after the news conference in which officials refused to say whether the victims included detainees, Democratic U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey called in to Dallas' WFAA-TV newscast and told them he was “absolutely sickened” by some officials' comments.

“If they are trying to control this narrative and they don't want migrants to be the victim in this story, then they may want to slow-walk giving us any information about this so they can still keep on talking about attacks on ICE,” Veasey said.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said details were still emerging, but the agency was confirming there were “multiple injuries and fatalities” at the field office. Noem said the motive remained unclear, but noted there has been an uptick in targeting of ICE agents.

A July 4 attack at a Texas immigration detention center injured a police officer, who was shot in the neck. Attackers dressed in black military-style clothing opened fire outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, federal prosecutors said. At least 11 people have been charged in connection with the attack.

A man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents as they were leaving a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen on July 7. The man, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, injured a police officer who responded to the scene before authorities shot and killed him. Police later found other weaponry, ammunition and backpacks inside his car.

Iran has begun rebuilding missile-production sites targeted by Israel during its 12-day war in June, satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press show, but a key component is likely still missing — the large mixers needed to produce solid fuel for the weapons.

WHY THIS MATTERS: Reconstituting the missile program is crucial for Iran, which believes another round of war with Israel may happen. The missiles are one of Iran's few military deterrents after the 12-day war with Israel in June decimated its air defense systems.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran has begun rebuilding missile-production sites targeted by Israel during its 12-day war in June, satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press show, but a key component is likely still missing — the large mixers needed to produce solid fuel for the weapons.

Reconstituting the missile program is crucial for the Islamic Republic, which believes another round of war with Israel may happen. The missiles are one of Iran's few military deterrents after the war decimated its air defense systems — something that Tehran long has insisted will never be included in negotiations with the West.

Missile experts told AP that obtaining the mixers is a goal for Tehran, particularly as it prepares for possible United Nations sanctions to be reimposed on the country later this month. The sanctions would penalize any development of the missile program, among other measures. In an address to the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian blamed the Israeli attacks and the separate U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites for “dealing a grievous blow” to peace negotiations.

Known as planetary mixers, the machines feature blades that revolve around a central point, like orbiting planets, and offer better mixing action than other types of equipment. Iran could purchase them from China, where experts and U.S. officials say they've purchased missile fuel ingredients and other components in the past.

“If they're able to reacquire some key things like planetary mixers, then that infrastructure is still there and ready to get rolling again,” said Sam Lair, a research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies who studied Iranian missile sites.

Iran's mission to the United Nations did not respond to questions about the country's efforts to rebuild its missile program.

Solid-fuel missiles can be fired faster than those using liquid fuel, which must be loaded just before launch. That speed can make the difference between launching a missile and having it destroyed in a launcher — something that happened during the war with Israel.

Iran has solid-fuel missile manufacturing bases at Khojir and Parchin, two sites just outside Tehran, as well as at Shahroud, some 350 kilometers (215 miles) northeast of the capital. Even before the most recent war, all of those sites came under Israeli attack in October 2024 during hostilities between the countries.






Attacks during the war in June appeared aimed at destroying buildings that housed the mixers, which are needed to ensure the missile fuel is evenly combined, according to experts. Other sites struck by Israel included manufacturing facilities that likely could be used to make the mixers.

Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC taken this month and analyzed by AP show construction at both the Parchin and Shahroud facilities.

At Parchin, mixing buildings appear to be under repair, Lair said, and similar rebuilding is happening at Shahroud involving mixing buildings and other structures.




The speed at which Iran is rebuilding shows the importance Tehran puts on its missile program. Iran's bombed nuclear sites so far have not seen the same level of activity.

During the war, Iran fired 574 ballistic missiles at Israel, according to the Washington-based Jewish Institute for National Security of America, which has a close relationship with the Israeli military. In two exchanges of fire before the war, Iran launched another 330 missiles, the think tank said.

The Israeli military had estimated Iran's total arsenal at around 2,500 missiles, meaning that over a third of its missiles were fired.

Before the war, Iran was on track to be able to produce more than 200 solid-fuel missiles a month, said Carl Parkin, a summer fellow at the James Martin Center. That drew Israeli strikes to missile-building facilities.

“Israel's targeting indicates that they believed mixing was a bottleneck in Iran's missile production,” he said. “If Iran is able to overcome their mixing limitations, they'll have all the casting capacity that they need to start producing at high volumes again.”

The Israeli military declined to respond to questions over its strategy. Iran's defense minister, Gen. Aziz Nasirzadeh, recently claimed Tehran now has new missiles with more advanced warheads.

“The 12-day war with Israel has altered some of our priorities,” he said on Aug. 22. “We are now focused on producing military equipment with higher precision and greater operational capabilities.”

Iran may choose to rely on China to obtain mixers and the chemicals to make solid fuel.

Such chemicals may have caused a massive explosion in April that killed at least 70 people at a port in Iran. Iran still has not explained the blast, which happened as its diplomats met with Americans in Oman over its nuclear program.

Just days after the explosion, the U.S. State Department sanctioned Chinese firms it said provided the Islamic Republic with “ballistic missile propellant ingredients.”

Meanwhile, Iran's Revolutionary Guard likely supplied a planetary mixer to an underground ballistic missile construction facility in Syria near the town of Masyaf, some 170 kilometers (105 miles) north of the capital, Damascus, near the Lebanese border. Footage released by the Israeli military months after the September 2024 raid on the facility showed the mixer, which bore a resemblance to others sold online by Chinese firms.

Iran's president and military officials visited Beijing earlier this month for China's Victory Day parade. Iran's government has provided no detailed readout on what Pezeshkian said to Chinese President Xi Jinping, and China's state-run media offered no indications that Tehran asked for help.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry, asked about possibly supplying Tehran mixers and fuel ingredients, told AP that Beijing is “willing to continue leveraging its influence to contribute to peace and stability in the Middle East.”

“China supports Iran in safeguarding its national sovereignty, security and national dignity,” the ministry said. “At the same time, China is deeply concerned about the continued escalation of tensions in the Middle East.”

Can Kasapoğlu, a senior fellow with the Washington-based Hudson Institute, said Beijing could supply guidance systems and microprocessors as well for Iran's ballistic missiles.

“If Iran uses its relationship with China to bolster its disruptive military capabilities, the 12-day war could be a mere speed bump for the Iranian regime, rather than a decisive defeat,” he wrote.

Lair, the analyst, said if Iran restarts its production at prewar levels, the sheer number of missiles produced will make it harder for the Israelis to preemptively destroy them or shoot them down.

“They are clearly very invested in their missile program, and I don't think that they're going to negotiate it away, ever,” he said.

Along Estonia's border with Russia, authorities are preparing for a potential conflict between NATO and Russia by extending a new border fence and building anti-tank ditches and bunkers. But those defenses won't stop the immediate threat the alliance faces from drones and electronic warfare. (AP video shot by Hendrik Osula, Production by Lorna Petty)

VINSKI, Estonia (AP) — Estonia is extending a fence along its border with Russia and building anti-tank ditches and bunkers in preparation for a potential conflict with Moscow. But those defenses won't guard against the threat that Estonia and its NATO allies face from Russian drones and electronic warfare.

From the Baltics to the Black Sea, countries bordering Russia, Belarus and Ukraine are facing the spillover from Moscow's war in Ukraine.

The incursion of about 20 Russian drones into Poland this month shone a spotlight on holes in NATO's air defenses, as multimillion-dollar jets had to be scrambled to respond to drones that cost thousands and that ended up crashing into the Polish countryside. Russia denied that it targeted Poland, but Polish officials suggested that it was intentional.

Faced with a growing problem, some European Union defense ministers will meet Friday to discuss creating a “drone wall.”

NATO warned Russia on Tuesday that it would defend against any further breaches of its airspace, after Estonia said that Russian fighter jets violated it last week. But although the alliance knows how to identify threats from jets and missiles, dealing with drones is a greater challenge, officials said. 

In Poland, “most of the drones were not detected,” Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said. “This is a real gap we have to solve.”

Military and defense officials from the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — NATO and EU members that border Russia — told The Associated Press that defending against drones requires solving a complex set of technological, financial and bureaucratic problems.




Europe needs cheaper technology to buy and to speed up slow production and procurement cycles, they said. But even then, drone technology is advancing so quickly that anything bought now could be outdated in months. 

“What I need,” said Lt. General Andrus Merilo, who commands Estonia's military, is technology that is “good enough, it's affordable and can be produced in mass.”

“I don't need high-end capabilities of which I can fire only one, against targets which will be attacking in hundreds,” he said.

Russia is using drones every night in Ukraine, because each drone is a “lottery ticket that always wins,” said Kusti Salm, a former top official at Estonia's Defense Ministry.

That's because a drone either hits something or, if Ukraine shoots it down with a missile, it drains Kyiv's air defenses and finances, since missiles are more expensive than drones, said Salm who now runs Frankenburg Technologies, a company developing low-cost anti-drone missiles.

Although NATO countries have a “very good understanding” of how to defend against conventional threats such as missiles and planes, they need to rapidly improve at dealing with drone threats, said Tomas Godliauskas, Lithuania's vice-minister of national defense.

When the Russian drones flew into Poland, NATO nations deployed fighter jets and attack helicopters and put missile defense systems on alert. But none of those options was specifically designed for drone warfare.

Although Russia and Ukraine have been firing more and more drones at each other, there has been less investment in counter-drone systems, Salm said. He suggested that's partly because it's easier to get a drone to fly than it is to develop something to detect or intercept it.

Slow, low-flying drones made from wood, fiberglass, plastic or polystyrene might not be detected by radar systems searching for a fast-moving missile made of metal, or they might look like birds or a plane. Enemy operatives can also bypass defenses by launching drones from inside a country, as Ukraine did to devastating effect when it attacked Russian airfields this year.

There are also other technological hurdles, including trying to jam the enemy's drones and communications without cutting your own, Merilo said.

In August, a Ukrainian drone — possibly sent off course by Russian electronic jamming — landed in a field in southeastern Estonia. It crashed because the military wasn't capable of detecting it, Merilo said.

The Estonian military and border force have also lost drones — used for surveillance and to stop illegal border crossings — to Russian jamming, which has also been blamed for disrupting flights.

Other drones have crashed in Romania, Moldova, Lithuania and Latvia, and there have been multiple unidentified drone sightings over military facilities and airports in Europe, including in Germany, the U.K., Norway and Denmark, where air traffic was halted for several hours at Copenhagen Airport on Monday.

The number of incidents shows that Europe needs to solve its drone problem “right now,” said Col. Māris Tūtins, head of information analysis and operations at Latvia's Joint Forces Headquarters.

There is growing support among European leaders for establishing some sort of drone wall along the EU's eastern border, though the 27-nation bloc in March denied funding to a joint Estonia-Lithuania proposal to establish one.

The EU needs to prioritize funding for the project, Pevkur said. But although support for the idea is growing, actually creating a drone defense system won't be easy.

“Drones are not mosquitoes,” the Estonian defense minister said, suggesting that they would be unlikely to be zapped by an “electronic wall” along NATO's borders.

There are many types of drones, including those used for intelligence and reconnaissance, that fly at high altitude, that are used in attacks or that even remain attached to a thin fiber-optic cable while flying, making them impossible to jam. Russia also uses decoy drones in Ukraine that carry no payload and are designed to exhaust air defenses. 

Any plan to defend against drones needs a multilayered approach, including sensors, “electronic warfare … also low-cost small missiles or attack drones,” Merilo said.

Although the need for better drone defenses isn't new, it's still largely only possible to buy systems that are “really expensive,” take a long time to develop and can't be mass-produced, Merilo said.

He suggested that's partly because big defense companies that have spent decades developing billion-dollar air defense systems might not want something new — and cheaper — on the market.

“We have to understand this game,” Merilo said, adding that some technology does exist, but “the question is who — and how fast they can start producing.” 

Facing nightly onslaughts, Ukraine is rapidly developing its own technology, including long-range attack drones and smaller ones for use on the front lines.

While big defense companies play a critical role in the defense of Europe, Latvia and some other NATO countries have turned to smaller companies — such as Salm's Frankenburg — to acquire its small anti-drone missiles once they're in production.

But a piecemeal approach isn't ideal, Salm said. Instead, the EU needs to invest more in European startups, which can turbocharge drone defense production that can be used by allies across different weapons systems, he said.

Europe needs to switch to “semi-wartime thinking” and foster greater collaboration between the military, government and defense industries to be able to fill its technology gap, Godliauskas said.

In Ukraine, it's sometimes only a matter of weeks between drone technology being developed and used on the battlefield. Europe “doesn't have time” to spend years waiting to acquire equipment, the Lithuanian official said. 

Another lesson from Ukraine is that what works today, might not work tomorrow, Godliauskas said.

While drone defense is critical now, it would be wrong to forget about everything else, Tūtins said. That's because Moscow is using “all means possible” to destabilize Europe, including hybrid warfare and cyberattacks, he said.

Jimmy Kimmel returned to late-night television after a nearly weeklong suspension and nearly broke down in tears, saying he wasn't trying to joke about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. (Sept. 23)

NEW YORK (AP) — Jimmy Kimmel returned to late-night television Tuesday after a nearly weeklong suspension and, in an emotional monologue where he appeared close to tears, said that he wasn't trying to joke about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

“I have no illusions about changing anyone's mind, but I do want to make something clear, because it's important to me as a human and that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man,” Kimmel said. “I don't think there's anything funny about it.”

He added that he wasn't trying to blame any specific group “for the actions of what ... was obviously a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make.” He said he understood his remarks last week to some “felt either ill-timed or unclear or maybe both.”




But he made no apologies. And he criticized the ABC affiliates who took his show off the air. Two stations groups that represent about a quarter of ABC stations, Sinclair and Nexstar, ordered their outlets not to show Kimmel on Tuesday.

“That's not American. It's un-American,” he said.



The incident triggered a national discussion about freedom of speech and President Donald Trump's ability to police the words of journalists, commentators and even comics. ABC suspended Kimmel's show last Wednesday following criticism of his remarks about the aftermath of Kirk's killing. But the network brought him back following a backlash against parent company Disney.

Kimmel thanked many supporters, including fellow late-night hosts past and present and even a former boss at a radio station in Seattle who checked in with him last week. He also singled out people he knows aren't fans of his comedy but stood up for his right to speak, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

“It takes courage for them to speak out against this administration,” he said. “They did, and they deserve credit for it.”

Kimmel nearly broke down again in praising Kirk's widow, Erika, who publicly forgave her husband's killer.

“That is an example we should follow,” he said. “If you believe in the teachings of Jesus as I do, there it was ... A selfless act of grace, forgiveness from a grieving widow. It touched me deeply. And I hope it touches many. And if there's anything we should take from this tragedy to carry forward, I hope it can be that. And not this.”

Kimmel admitted that he was mad when ABC suspended him, but praised his bosses for putting him back on the air. “Unjustly, this puts them at risk.”

He mocked Trump for criticizing him for bad ratings. “He tried his best to cancel me and instead he forced millions of people to watch this show,” Kimmel said.

The decisions by Sinclair and Nexstar left ABC stations in Washington, D.C.; St. Louis; Nashville, Tennessee, and Richmond, Virginia among the cities airing something else. WJLA-TV, the Sinclair-owned station in Washington, instead aired a newscast and an episode of the chain's show, “The National Desk.”

Kimmel's suspension came after an angry reaction to comments he made in monologues early last week. A relentless Trump critic in his comedy, Kimmel suggested that many Trump supporters were trying to capitalize on Kirk's death and were “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.”



Trump-appointed Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr last week said it appeared that Kimmel was trying to “directly mislead the American public” with his remarks about Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old Utah man charged with Kirk's killing, and his motives. Those motives remain unclear. Authorities say Robinson grew up in a conservative family, but his mother told investigators his son had turned left politically in the last year.

“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said before ABC announced the suspension. “These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”

Those remarks were key to the backlash, with Cruz saying that Carr acted like “a mafioso.” Hundreds of entertainment luminaries, including Tom Hanks, Barbra Streisand and Jennifer Aniston, signed a letter circulated by the American Civil Liberties Union that called ABC's move “a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation.”

Podcaster Joe Rogan weighed in Tuesday on Kimmel's side. “I definitely don't think that the government should be involved — ever — in dictating what a comedian can or can't say in a monologue,” Rogan said. “You are crazy for supporting this because this will be used on you.”

Some consumers punished ABC parent Disney by canceling subscriptions to its streaming services.

Trump had hailed Kimmel's suspension and criticized his return, writing on his Truth Social platform: “I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back ... Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who's not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE.”

Actor Robert De Niro appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on Tuesday, impersonating Carr being interviewed by Kimmel. De Niro, as Carr, said the FCC had a new motto, “Sticks and stones can break your bones.”

Isn't there more to the saying, Kimmel asked, that words can never hurt you?

“They can hurt you now,” De Niro responded, saying you have to make sure to say the right ones.

Kimmel took the stage to a long standing ovation and chants of “Jimmy, Jimmy.” One audience member, Walter Bates, said after the taping that Kimmel's discussion of Kirk's widow “was a very moving moment. I got very emotional and so did my wife.”

Trump's administration has used threats, lawsuits and federal government pressure to try to exert more control over the media industry. Trump sued ABC and CBS over news coverage, which the companies settled. Trump has also filed defamation lawsuits against The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, and successfully urged Congress to strip federal funding from NPR and PBS.

After pulling out of her planned performance at the premiere of Hulu's Lilith Fair documentary in protest over Kimmel's suspension, singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan appeared on Kimmel's show as the musical guest. McLachlan had been booked on the show prior to the preemption, a representative told The Associated Press.

The other guest was actor Glen Powell.

The suspension happened at a time when the late-night landscape is shifting. Shows are losing viewers, in part because many watch highlights the next day online. CBS announced the cancellation of “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert's show over the summer. Kimmel's contract with ABC reportedly lasts through May.

Colbert, in his own monologue Monday shortly after ABC announced Kimmel would return, grabbed his recently won Emmy Award for outstanding talk series, saying, “Once more, I am the only martyr on late night!”

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries held a press conference in response to President Donald Trump canceling a planned meeting with congressional Democrat leaders to discuss government funding before the Sept. 30 shutdown deadline.

FIRST ON FOX: A Senate Republican wants to know the exact cost of a partial government shutdown as GOP and Democratic leaders are at an impasse to keep the government open.

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, called on the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to provide a detailed report on the sprawling impact that a partial government shutdown could have, including payments throughout the federal government and the possible broader economic impact.

The House GOP passed its short-term funding extension, known as a continuing resolution (CR), last week, but the bill was later blocked by Senate Democrats. For now, Republicans and Democrats in the upper chamber are at odds on a plan to keep the government open.

And the deadline to fund the government by Sept. 30 is fast approaching.

Ernst, who chairs the Senate DOGE Caucus named after tech-billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, laid the fault of a potential shutdown on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in her letter to CBO Director Phillip Swagel.

""The same politicians who whined and complained about the Department of Government Efficiency laying off unnecessary bureaucrats just a few months ago are now forcing a government-wide shutdown themselves to expose who is and isn't an essential employee,"" she wrote.

Ernst requested a sweeping economic operational impact analysis from the agency, including how a shutdown could affect back pay costs for furloughed non-essential employees, military pay, congressional pay and the broader economic impact that the government closing could have on the private sector.

TRUMP CANCELS MEETING WITH SCHUMER, JEFFRIES OVER 'RIDICULOUS DEMANDS' AS FUNDING DEADLINE LOOMS

Specifically, she wanted to know how businesses could be impacted by a temporary stoppage of government services, like loans, permits and certifications, and how companies and businesses could recoup losses after a shutdown ended.

She also wanted information on lost efficiencies in the government and the costs that could accrue from unfulfilled procurements or allowing contracts to lapse, and whether the burden of keeping national parks open would fall onto the states or if they'd be shuttered, too.

The CBO did provide an analysis of the cost of the last time the government shuttered in 2019, when Schumer and President Donald Trump were at odds on providing funding to construct a wall at the southern border. That 35-day shutdown was the longest in U.S. history, and no funding for a border wall was granted.

The report, published in January 2019, found that the shutdown saw roughly $18 billion in federal spending delayed, which led to a dip in that year's first quarter gross domestic product of $8 billion. The report noted roughly $3 billion of that would not be recovered.

THUNE SLAMS DEMOCRATS' 'COLD-BLOODED PARTISAN' TACTICS AS FUNDING DEADLINE NEARS

It also found that federal workers who received delayed payments and private businesses were the hardest hit.

""Some of those private-sector entities will never recoup that lost income,"" the report stated.

It remains unclear whether Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Schumer can strike a deal. After Trump canceled a planned meeting Tuesday with Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., both Democrats blamed the president for the looming shutdown.

However, Democrats' asking price for a short-term funding extension is too high for Republicans.

They want permanent extensions to Affordable Care Act subsidies, a full repeal of the ""big, beautiful bill's"" health care title, which includes the $50 billion rural hospital fund, and a clawback of the canceled funding for NPR and PBS.

""Once again, Donald Trump has shown the American people he is not up to the job,"" Schumer said. ""It's a very simple job: sit down and negotiate with the Democratic leaders and come to an agreement, but he just ain't up to it. He runs away before the negotiations even begin.""

Texas Rep. Roger Williams discusses the congressional reaction to former President Trump's 'not guilty' plea and explains how the congressional baseball game showcases the greatness of America.

Republicans on the Small Business Committees face a deadline to scrap Biden-era rules requiring 10% of federal contract resources go to DEI, even as the USDOT warns Maryland over its handling of Francis Scott Key Bridge contracts.

In Congress, the SBIR and STTR programs – dubbed ""America's seed fund(s)"" – help small businesses apply for grants across federal agencies, in commercial and technology sectors, respectively.

Ahead of the September 30 reauthorization deadline for both key programs, Sen. Joni Ernst, chair of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, expressed urgency to cut out DEI requirements.

Ernst, R-Iowa, told Fox News Digital her INNOVATE Act – for which Rep. Roger Williams, R-Texas, also drafted a version earlier this summer – would replace any reauthorization legislation and remove requirements for DEI considerations and direct grants based on merit, not politics.

DUFFY CLASHES WITH DEMOCRATS OVER DEI FUNDING CUTS, DENIES AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS LET GO

Ernst also highlighted some of what she considered the more wasteful grants awarded under the current rubric – including a $1.4 million NIH appropriation for what was entitled a ""Mobile App Promoting Sexual Health for Young Black Men Who Have Sex With Men.""

Another healthcare-related grant she lambasted offered $283,526 for Evidence-Based Parent Training for Diverse Families – citing LGBTQ+ people whose ""relationships do not fit within heterosexual…norms [and] are increasingly having children or considering"" so. The Pentagon and other agencies had similar such grants approved under previous administrations, according to a source familiar.

With less than a week before the program sunsets unless Congress acts, a source familiar with the talks said many Republicans back Ernst's push to block such spending and grant rules but acknowledge the math is against them with Democrats united in opposition.

BRIDGE COLLAPSE AID BECOMES ECONOMIC WEAPON IN ESCALATING TRUMP-MOORE FEUD

Williams has favored a one-year extension of the current SBIR/STTR program with the clock winding down – giving time to focus on promptly reforming it without being under the gun -- but offered a ringing endorsement of both chambers' similar legislation.

""I want to thank Senator Ernst for her partnership when introducing the House version of her INNOVATE Act in July, and remain in lockstep with her on ensuring contracts are awarded based on merit, not DEI,"" Williams told Fox News Digital.

""We must ensure there is no lapse in funding for current, deserving SBIR/STTR participants before the September 30 deadline.""

Meanwhile, across the Anacostia River from the Capitol, Maryland lawmakers got an earful from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy after he learned of that state's own rubric for similar contracts.

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore faces the daunting task of rebuilding the Francis Scott Key Bridge on the Baltimore Beltway after a freighter struck and destroyed it in 2024 – but the Trump administration cried foul at the way Annapolis purportedly is considering who will do the job.

Duffy wrote to Moore on Thursday thanking him for working with USDOT on the project but expressed concern that Annapolis may ""intend to award contracts for the FSK Bridge project in a manner that relies on race and sex of contractors.""

He warned the governor of the potential legal ramifications of doing so, citing the Civil Rights Act.

On the day it collapsed, then-President Joe Biden separately promised the federal government would cover the entire estimated $1.8 billion cost to make Interstate 695 a full circle once more, while Duffy instead referenced the state – as the MDTA controlled the FSK Bridge when it collapsed.

When asked about the letter, Moore provided Fox News Digital with a public response to Duffy:

""We will continue to work with the Trump Administration to find ways to reduce costs and rebuild faster,"" Moore said, in part. ""We anticipate the price estimation process to be finalized in the coming months, and we will provide regular updates from the Maryland Department of Transportation about the project's status.""

Moore has repeatedly highlighted progress MDTA has made on the bridge, telling President Donald Trump in an exchange captured by Fox Nation at the U.S. Naval Academy – just down the street from the State House — that ""we will have it done in [20]28.""

""In the meantime, we will continue to pursue litigation and make substantial financial contributions by way of advance construction costs and insurance settlement dollars to keep the project moving.""

Moore – who announced last week he would seek re-election instead of a potential 2028 Democratic bid – added the safety of the new FSK Bridge and ""sound stewardship"" of Marylanders' tax dollars are paramount to both the Port of Baltimore and people across the country.

Fox News' Griff Jenkins reports the latest on the shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas. 

At least three people were shot, one of whom was killed, in a shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas on Wednesday, Fox News confirmed.

The FBI says it is investigating the incident as a ""targeted attack"" against ICE, and multiple sources familiar with the investigation have identified the alleged shooter as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn. Representatives for the FBI at a Wednesday morning press conference in Dallas said that preliminary investigations uncovered anti-ICE messaging on bullet rounds found near the shooter.

The shooting reportedly occurred as ICE officers were transferring detainees into the facility. The shooter died due to a self-inflicted wound shortly after the attack, authorities say. The three individuals who were shot were all detainees, and one of them has died.

The three detainees were shot while inside a law enforcement van, ICE sources told Fox News' Brooke Taylor.

""These despicable, politically motivated attacks against law enforcement are not a one-off. We are only miles from Prarieland Texas where just two months ago an individual ambushed a separate ICE facility targeting their officers. It has to end and the FBI and our partners will lead the these investigative efforts to see to it that those who target our law enforcement are pursued and brought to the fullest extent of justice,"" FBI director Kash Patel wrote on X.

Authorities say Patel was in Dallas for a ""prescheduled visit"" on Wednesday morning. The FBI says he visited law enforcement at the ""incident command location"" following the attack.

The Dallas Police Department sources told Fox News the shooting occurred at roughly 6:30 a.m. local time. They say no law enforcement officers were injured, but that three detainees were shot and two were killed.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed there were ""multiple fatalities.""

""There was a shooting this morning at the Dallas ICE Detention Facility,"" Noem wrote on X. ""Details are still emerging but we can confirm there were multiple injuries and fatalities. The shooter is deceased by a self-inflicted gunshot wound.""

""While we don't know motive yet, we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them. It must stop. Please pray for the victims and their families,"" she added.

Authorities say the shooter opened fire when the sally port to the facility was open during the transfer of detainees, attempting to force his way in.

Multiple people were shot and killed in an ""attack"" on an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas on Wednesday, September 24, 2025. 

""The obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop. I'm praying for everyone hurt in this attack and for their families,"" Vice President JD Vance wrote on X.

DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughin noted during an appearance on Fox News that it was ""just a month ago to the day that there was a viable bomb threat"" in Dallas.

""So this location, it looks like it's been targeted, and we don't know how long this individual has been planning this act. It looks like he could have been watching to look at the processing and see what happens on a day-to-day basis at this Dallas field office. But [these are] all answers that Homeland Security investigation is going to get down to the bottom of,"" McLaughlin added.

She reiterated calls for critics of ICE to tone down their rhetoric after the attack.

""We don't want to get anyone killed,"" she said.

Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Texas, who represents the district containing the ICE facility, said his office is aware of the shooting and is monitoring the situation.

""We are keeping the victims in prayer and will update the North Texas community as we get news on their conditions and learn more about the suspect,"" Veasey wrote on X.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott reacted to the attack on Wednesday, framing it as an ""assassination.

""Texas fully supports ICE,"" Abbott wrote. ""Both the Texas Dept. of Public Safety & Texas National Guard work closely with ICE. This assassination will NOT slow our arrest, detention, and deportation of illegal immigrants. We will work with ICE and the Dallas Police Dept. to get to the bottom of the assassin's motive. We will offer ICE additional support to assist their operations,"" he added.

New York resident Jon Barr went to Rhode Island's The Nordic, one of the most expensive all-you-can-eat buffets in America, and reveals why it's worth the price tag.

An 18-year-old man ate 40 pieces of sashimi — thinly sliced raw fish and seafood — at a family lunch to celebrate his acceptance into law school as an undergraduate, only to have his mother say he embarrassed her and made it appear she didn't feed him enough.

""I recently got into law school and am now an LLB [bachelor of law] student,"" the man wrote in a Reddit forum. ""My parents decided to take me to a special lunch at a buffet as a reward.""

Aunts, uncles and cousins attended the lunch, he said. 

IS IT 'RUDE' TO BOX UP LEFTOVERS WHEN SOMEONE ELSE PAYS? FATHER-SON FEUD SPARKS DEBATE

The man said he didn't usually eat much for lunch because he'd been saving money to buy textbooks. At the buffet, however, he decided to indulge, especially in sashimi, a Japanese delicacy.

""This was a buffet, and they had some really nice dishes,"" he wrote. ""I sampled many things and ended up wolfing down 40 pieces of sashimi. … I know because I went to the counter five times and got eight pieces each time.""

A young man (not pictured) wrote in a Reddit post that his mom was embarrassed by how much he ate at a buffet with family and friends. (iStock)

""My dad didn't say anything, but my mom later told me I embarrassed her by eating like a starving kid – that the amount I ate made it look like she didn't feed me enough,"" the son continued. ""She was very upset about it.""

Many commenters jumped in to say that eating a lot is the point of a buffet. 

AUNT BLAMES NIECE AFTER ACCIDENTALLY EATING DOG FOOD DURING VISIT, SPARKING FAMILY DRAMA

""You're an 18-year-old male,"" one Reddit user wrote. ""Isn't it common knowledge that your type can eat staggering amounts in one sitting?""

Another person said his mom's reaction was like ""taking a kid to an amusement park and then scolding them for having too much fun.""

The young man said he took five helpings of sashimi at a celebratory buffet with his family. (iStock)

Others said they would be cheering on the student for getting his money's worth.

""I doubt anyone except your mom noticed or cared that you were eating a lot,"" another commenter noted.

""If a child eats like they're starving, it can feel to a parent like an unspoken criticism of their caregiving.""

Parents often tie their child's behavior back to themselves, said Sandra Kushnir, a licensed marriage and family therapist and CEO of Meridian Counseling in Los Angeles.

""Food is deeply tied to notions of care,"" Kushnir told Fox News Digital. ""Many parents see it as an expression of love and responsibility. If a child eats like they're starving, it can feel to a parent like an unspoken criticism of their caregiving.""

FAMILY VACATION DRAMA ERUPTS OVER GRANDMOTHER'S REQUEST FOR DINNER WITH HER GROWN KIDS ONLY

She suggested the son acknowledge his mom's feelings without taking blame and saying, ""I see that it upset you because of how it looked, but I wasn't trying to send that message. I was just excited and enjoying the food.""

Kushnir added, ""By validating her feelings while clarifying his intention, he opens space for understanding rather than defensiveness.""

While most Redditors sided with the original poster, some felt otherwise.

Most Reddit users sided with the ravenous young man, while a few sympathized with the appalled mother. (iStock)

""Forty pieces of sashimi sounds like quite a lot,"" one person said. ""But I don't see why it couldn't be eaten in a polite, civilized manner. Then again, your mom's reaction suggests that perhaps it wasn't.""

Another person sympathized with the mother, writing, ""I'd be slightly uncomfortable, too, in such a situation. That's totally not your fault, though.""

Annalisa Nash Fernandez, an intercultural strategist at Connecticut-based Because Culture, said buffets come with a kind of social contract.

""The person piling their plate high breaks an unspoken covenant,"" Fernandez told Fox News Digital. ""Not because of food scarcity in most contexts, but because they've violated the kind of restraint that makes communal abundance possible.""

Some people argue there is no such thing as taking or eating ""too much"" at a buffet as long as table manners are followed. (iStock)

Other etiquette experts, however, said there is no such thing as having ""too much"" at a buffet.

""As long as you're following whatever rules the buffet has set and are using your best table manners, then you're probably in the clear, etiquette-wise,"" said Nick Leighton, a New York-based co-host of the podcast ""Were You Raised By Wolves?""

He added, ""Etiquette cares about pacing, and it looks far less gluttonous to go back for seconds – or thirds – on [a] fresh plate.""

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins explains how the USDA is tackling a flesh-eating parasite that can threaten American cattle and sounds the alarm on how much farmland China owns on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Mexico activated emergency controls Monday after detecting a new case of New World screwworm in cattle in the northern border state of Nuevo Leon, the closest case to the U.S. border since the outbreak began last year.

The animal, found in the town of Sabinas Hidalgo, came from the Gulf state of Veracruz, Mexico's National Health for Food Safety and Food Quality Service said. 

The last case was reported July 9 in Veracruz, prompting Washington to suspend imports of live Mexican cattle.

WHY SOME STEAKHOUSES ARE THRIVING WHILE OTHERS CAN'T KEEP DINERS COMING BACK: 'NOT JUST ABOUT THE FOOD'

The parasite, a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly, attacks warm-blooded animals, including humans. Mexico has reported more than 500 active cases in cattle across southern states.

The block on cattle imports has spelled trouble for Mexico's government, which has already been busy trying to offset the brunt of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats this year.

The government and ranchers have sought to get the ban lifted. 

If it stays in place through the year, Mexico's ranching federation estimates losses up to $400 million.

""It is extremely concerning for the American cattle industry that New World screwworm has moved so far north in Mexico and now is just 70 miles from the border,"" Colin Woodall, CEO of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, said in a statement.

""The speed that screwworm has moved through Mexico is a reminder that this pest poses a critical and urgent threat to America's cattle producers.""

Cochliomyia hominovorax is the primary screwworm fly in the New World. Larvae are obligate parasites of living flesh in humans and other mammals.  (USDA)

Mollie Engelhart, a former vegan restaurateur who is now a Texas rancher, told Fox News Digital she's ""very concerned"" about the screwworm situation.

""I believe that the most important thing for our cattle industry right now is to bring our herd size up and the diversification of our processing for major packers,"" Engelhart said, adding that she believes there is a greater need for local food processing than ever before.

Mexico's Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegué said in a post on X that Mexico is ""controlling the isolated case of screwworm in Nuevo Leon,"" under measures to fight the pest agreed with the U.S. in August.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Washington will take ""decisive measures to protect our borders, even in the absence of cooperation,"" and said imports of Mexican cattle, bison and horses will remain suspended.

""We will not rely on Mexico to defend our industry, our food supply or our way of life,"" she said.

NewsNation reached a major milestone on Sunday, outperforming CNN and MSNBC in total viewers and the key advertising demographic of adults aged 25-54 for six consecutive hours, the first time the network has achieved that feat, according to Nielsen data.

From 1 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. ET, the network averaged 615,000 viewers overall and 173,000 in the 25-54 demo. Coverage was anchored by Chief Washington Correspondent Leland Vittert and later by Nichole Berlie, who hosted a special edition of NewsNation Now. Programming included live coverage of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk's memorial service, followed by analysis and reaction.

The Sunday block marked NewsNation's highest-rated Sunday ever, far surpassing its normal averages. Viewership was up nearly 1,000% compared to the network's typical Sunday afternoon ratings. At its peak, around 3:57 p.m. ET, nearly 2 million people were watching, with 1.96 million total viewers recorded.

The surge gave NewsNation decisive wins over its competitors.

CNN averaged 342,000 viewers during the same period (54,000 in the demo), while MSNBC managed 287,000 viewers (31,000 demo).

The strong showing follows another victory the previous week, when NewsNation topped CNN and MSNBC in Saturday prime-time ratings. However, the six-hour stretch on Sunday was the first time the network has simultaneously outperformed both rivals for such a sustained duration in total viewership and the 25-54 demo.

KAMALA HARRIS'S BOOK TOUR: SIX TAKEAWAYS FROM HER RETURN TO THE SPOTLIGHT

While NewsNation celebrated a breakthrough, Fox News once again led cable news.

The network averaged 5.2 million viewers and 755,000 in the 25-54 demo during the same 1:30–7:15 p.m. ET window, according to Nielsen's Big Data Plus Panel. That accounted for nearly 90% of total cable news viewership. Fox's audience peaked during Erika Kirk's tribute at 6 p.m. ET hour, drawing 6.6 million total viewers and 1.1 million in the demo.

The memorial service ratings highlighted a shifting cable landscape: Fox News remains the undisputed leader, NewsNation is carving out new territory with record viewership, and CNN and MSNBC continue to slide further behind.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

What if I told you 10 years ago that a presidential nominee who received more votes than any other woman in history and nearly won the presidency was relegated to the dustbin of history less than one year later?

Would that seem plausible? Well, it's happening before our eyes.

HARRIS WARNS DEMOCRATS AGAINST FIXATION ON MAMDANI: ‘NOT THE ONLY STAR'

Former Vice President Kamala Harris launched the book tour that nobody asked for on Tuesday. The title of her tome, 107 Days, chronicles what can be considered the worst presidential campaign of our lifetimes. Team Harris blew through $1.5 billion in cash, and then some, ending up in debt, and got zero return on investment by losing every swing state and the popular vote, while also surrendering control of the Senate. In the end, and this number is truly something, 89% of counties in the U.S. went more red than blue when compared to the 2020 election.

“This is the first book to begin in Chapter 11,” Fox News's Jimmy Failia joked this week on America's Newsroom.

As she often has done throughout her political career, Harris uses the book to do the same thing Hillary Clinton did for her loss, “What Happened,” in 2016: blame almost everyone but herself. And she's doing this while also laughably claiming that if she just had more time to campaign, the result would have been different.

Actually, it was quite the opposite: The more she spoke, the more she was seen, the more her poll numbers went in the wrong direction. Think back to late July and August 2024: Harris is installed as the Democratic nominee without one vote from the public after President Joe Biden is tossed aside by his own party following a horrific debate performance in late June.

But what did her team do for the first six weeks of the campaign? Not allow her to do even one sit-down interview, even in the most friendly confines of MSNBC, CNN, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, or The View. So it's a bit rich for Harris to lament not having more time to make her case to the electorate while allowing herself to be sidelined.

But her campaign likely knew what many of us already did: Outside of prepared remarks in a teleprompter, Harris is a human Chernobyl. She simply has no talent for thinking or speaking extemporaneously. And when she has tried to do so in the past, such as her first run for president in 2020, she dropped out before the first votes were cast in Iowa.

It is ironic that Harris's team has chosen The View for her first broadcast network interview for the book tour. It was here in October 2024 that her campaign essentially ended: Sunny Hostin asked her a T-ball question about what she would do differently than Biden.

“You know … there is not a thing that comes to mind,” she answered while looking skyward.

Game. Set. Match.

Here was Democratic strategist James Carville‘s reaction: “The country wants something different. And she's asked, as is so often the case, in a friendly audience, on The View, ‘How would you be different than Biden?' That's the one question that you exist to answer, all right? That is it. That's the money question. That's the one you want. That's the one that everybody wants to know the answer to. And you freeze! You literally freeze and say, ‘Well, I can't think of anything'”

Usually, a major book tour like this is used as a stepping stone to another campaign. But it's virtually impossible to see Harris running again. This isn't Ronald Reagan coming back in 1980 after falling just short of the nomination in '76. Her base is nonexistent. Most people who voted for Harris were voting against Trump.

A recent poll from Atlas Intel, the most accurate pollster of the 2024 election, has Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) easily on top when polling Democratic voters as to their preferred nominee at 37.6%. Harris, despite being vice president for four years and getting more than 75 million votes less than one year ago, is a distant second at 20.5%. Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg (12.1%), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) (10.8%), and Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) (3.6%) round out the top five.

Speaking of Walz, who did the Harris campaign no favors as her running mate, thanks to him lying about fighting in war zones and claiming he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square riots — he was in Nebraska — Harris says she was forced into choosing the goofy governor of Minnesota because America wasn't ready for a gay vice president in Pete Buttigieg.

As for her relationship with Biden, Harris claimed that she couldn't ask him not to run again before accusing him of being reckless by staying in. “It's Joe and Jill's decision,” she writes. “We all said that, like a mantra, as if we'd all been hypnotized. Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high. This wasn't a choice that should have been left to an individual's ego, an individual's ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.”

Again, this is all so phony. She knew what his cognitive state was and lied directly to the public about it. Here's what Harris said right after Biden's debate against Trump that ended his political career: “Joe Biden is extraordinarily strong.” She then said, with a straight face to Anderson Cooper on CNN that night, Biden had a “slow start” but a “strong finish,” an assessment that exactly zero other people came away with. “He got into a groove where it counted,” she later told MSNBC. “Our president showed that he will win the election.”

Uh-huh.

Harris is doing herself no favors with this book, and this already feels more like a revenge tour. How is Walz feeling today after hearing that he wasn't her first choice as her running mate? How do the Bidens feel about her calling them self-serving?

On Tuesday, she sat down with Michael Strahan on Good Morning America. And her answer to the question, “Do you think Biden could have run the country for four years?” was met with the ultimate incoherent word salad.

“My concern about him running for reelection was completely separate from his capacity to serve … which was consistent and never wavered.”

So, she thinks Biden couldn't campaign for a few months, but could run the country for another four years? How does this remotely make sense?

Harris's book will finish at No. 1 on the bestseller lists. She likely got a hefty advance from Simon & Schuster. On that front, the book is a success.

DESANTIS UNVEILS PLANS FOR TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY IN MIAMI

But given that she and her husband are already worth millions, this isn't about the money. It's about getting back into power again.

And thanks to napalming every remaining bridge to those who were once her allies, it's safe to say this will be the last we see of Harris on any major political stage again.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A new California law that bans federal immigration officers from wearing face masks in the state is unconstitutional and unenforceable, according to former law enforcement officials.

Over the weekend, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) signed five bills into law that aim at restraining the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement from arresting illegal immigrants across the West Coast state, a move that he said was meant to deter federal authorities from carrying out President Donald Trump's mass deportation operation.

Other laws included policies barring ICE from accessing schools and hospitals without a judicial warrant and requiring schools, colleges, and universities to alert parents when ICE is on campus.

One such law, SB 627, made it illegal for local police and sheriff's department employees, federal police, and state police from states other than California to wear face masks while working. California state police were exempt from the face mask ban.

The trouble for Newsom, according to several former police officials who spoke with the Washington Examiner on Tuesday, is that although the state could enforce this mask ban against its own local police and sheriff's deputies, it cannot dictate how federal police present themselves.

Jonathan Fahey, former acting ICE director, said going after federal police would violate the Constitution's Supremacy Clause because federal law is supreme.

“When a federal officer is acting within their official capacity and doing what they believe is … within the scope of their employment, they cannot be prosecuted, even if it in fact violated a state law,” said Fahey, now partner with the Holtzman Vogel law firm in Washington. “Everyone knows that [California] can't do this.”

Bill Johnson, executive director of a national police organization representing more than a quarter of a million officers, agreed with Fahey.

“It seems pretty clear from a constitutional perspective that any efforts by California to thwart federal law enforcement actions will fail under the federal constitution's Supremacy Clause,” said Johnson, who leads the National Association of Police Organizations. “No doubt the governor and his advisers are aware of this, but once again have chosen the cheap theatrics of another ill-advised state policy that will be quickly struck down.”

Brian R. Marvel, president of the Peace Officers Research Association of California, said the governor's plan would turn local police into a “punching bag to grandstand against the federal government” and said the organization's 83,000 officers opposed it.

Johnson added that the law “seems just like more of the same old song and dance” from California politicians.

“Instead of focusing on all the problems within California and failure after failure of their policies, the governor once again seeks to deflect attention by stoking anger against law-enforcement officers and agents,” Johnson said. “These proposals ignore the very real threats and attacks against law-enforcement officers and their families at all levels.”

Sgt. Betsy Brantner Smith, who spent nearly three decades at a large police department in the Chicago suburbs, said the California law was likely “ceremonial” and explained that face masks serve a purpose.

“We wear face coverings in certain situations to prevent us — the law enforcement officer — from being identified,” Smith said. “It could be, again, from the doxing. It can also be because those officers are working in some sort of undercover capacity, some sort of tactical capacity. For example, SWAT teams and tactical teams very often wear face coverings, again, to prevent them from being identified, not to be hiding from the public.”

ICE did not respond to a request for comment, but Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin stated, “We don't need to abide by this garbage.”

California police could run into their own legal trouble if they attempt to arrest ICE personnel when the ban takes effect on Jan. 1, 2026.

“If a state officer tried to arrest like an ICE agent for wearing a mask while they're out doing their job, the state officer would actually be arguably guilty of obstructing justice, and an ICE agent would be able to arrest the state officer who's trying to arrest them,” Fahey said.

A Department of Justice spokesperson would not comment on how the federal government would handle potential state enforcement of the mask ban, but did note in a statement sent Tuesday evening that “protecting the safety and security of our federal law enforcement officers, ridding our country of dangerous illegal aliens, will continue to be a top priority for this Administration.”

Newsom has led the Democratic effort to fight back against the Trump administration, accusing President Donald Trump of “authoritarian tendencies” and abusing his authority on numerous occasions. Fahey quipped that Newsom could be the one determined to be abusing power if he required California police to enforce the ICE mask ban.

“What could be more an abuse of power to sign a law that is clearly unconstitutional, which would give the states power that they don't have under the Constitution to enforce laws,” Fahey said. “So if they actually try to enact this, it's a complete abuse of power.”

Newsom's office did not respond to a request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Throughout this week, the Washington Examiner's Restoring America project will feature its latest series titled “Reforming the Deep State: Reining in the Federal Bureaucracy.” We invited some of the best policy minds in the conservative movement to speak to the issues of what waste, fraud, abuse, and unaccountability exist throughout the federal government and what still needs to be done. To read more from this series, click here.

The deep state does not always hide in the shadows. Sometimes it sits in broad daylight, draped in the language of “accountability” and “oversight,” quietly consolidating power that does not belong to it. 

The Government Accountability Office is one of its most effective instruments — a legislative branch agency that has morphed from watchdog to enforcer, using its structural insulation from presidential control to police the executive branch without ever answering to the voters.

What began as a modest auditing service for Congress has become a political weapon. Under the guise of interpreting the Impoundment Control Act, the GAO now issues legal “findings” against the president, treats its own interpretations as binding, and threatens enforcement, despite being led by a comptroller general who can be removed only by Congress. That is not oversight. It is the execution of the law by a legislative officer — a direct violation of the constitutional separation of powers.

The Constitution draws a bright line between those who make the laws and those who execute them. Article II vests “[t]he executive Power” in the president alone, who must “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” That means enforcement power must be subject to presidential direction and removal authority. In Bowsher v. Synar, the Supreme Court held that because the comptroller general is removable by Congress, he is a legislative officer who cannot execute the law. And in Seila Law v. CFPB, the court reaffirmed that principal officers wielding significant executive power must be accountable to the president. The GAO's current behavior ignores both holdings.

Even under the ICA's text, the GAO is not an enforcement agency. Its legal opinions are advisory, not binding. Yet in recent years, particularly during the Trump administration, the GAO has operated as though it can compel compliance. It has declared the president in violation of the ICA for pausing funds, demanded the release of appropriations, and even floated the idea of initiating litigation against the executive branch. No clause of the Constitution authorizes Congress to install its own legislative officer as prosecutor of the laws.

RICHARD NIXON ENABLED THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE

The D.C. Circuit's recent decision in Global Health Council v. Trump underscores why this is an unlawful power grab. There, the court reaffirmed that even the judiciary cannot enjoin the president's discretionary execution of statutory authority, nor can the Administrative Procedure Act be used to compel him directly. If Article III courts, vested with the judicial power of the United States, cannot order the president to act, then the GAO, a legislative support agency, certainly cannot dictate executive action. Its “findings” are no more than political statements wrapped in legalese.

The deep state thrives on exactly this kind of mission creep. By shifting power to entities shielded from direct political control, it insulates policy from voters. The comptroller general serves a 15-year term, is selected from a congressional short list, and is removable only by Congress through impeachment or joint resolution. That means a single unelected figure, untouchable by the president, can spend a decade and a half influencing how laws are executed without any democratic accountability.

The GAO's pocket rescission reversal is a case in point. For over 40 years, the agency acknowledged that the ICA permits the president to transmit a rescission proposal late in the fiscal year, withhold the funds for 45 days, and allow them to lapse if Congress fails to act. It even called this a “major deficiency” in the law back in 1975. Congress never changed the text. Only when President Donald Trump used the authority did the GAO suddenly reverse its interpretation, declaring pocket rescissions illegal. That shift was not a constitutional interpretation but partisan maneuvering, timed to frustrate a president the “permanent class” opposed.

And the favoritism is not subtle. When President Joe Biden froze congressionally appropriated funds for border wall construction in 2021 — precisely the kind of pause that triggered a GAO violation finding against Trump — the GAO declared Biden's conduct lawful. When Trump paused Ukraine security aid for policy review, the GAO found a violation. When Biden paused border wall funding for policy review, the GAO found no violation. The facts were parallel. The rulings were opposite. This is not even-handed law enforcement. It is partisan lawfare. Such double standards strip the GAO of any claim to neutrality and confirm what many Americans already suspect: The deep state protects its allies and punishes its adversaries.

If Congress believes the ICA gives the president too much discretion, it can amend the law. What it cannot do is deputize its own legislative agent to reinterpret the statute on the fly and enforce that reinterpretation against the executive branch. Such an arrangement collapses the separation of powers and creates exactly the hybrid legislative-executive officer the court rejected in Bowsher.

CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE ‘REFORMING THE DEEP STATE' SERIES

The path forward is clear. The GAO must be returned to its original role: auditor and adviser, not enforcer. The ICA's enforcement provisions should be repealed or rewritten to ensure that any binding legal determinations are made by officers within the executive branch, subject to presidential direction and removal. If the Comptroller General is to wield executive power, he must be removable by the president — full stop.

The stakes are not merely academic. Every time the GAO issues a “binding” directive to the executive, it chips away at the Constitution's structure. The deep state's genius lies in doing so under the cover of normalcy, making radical power shifts appear as routine bureaucratic operations. But our liberty depends on resisting precisely these encroachments. Congress can and should investigate, recommend, and criticize. It cannot execute the law. The Founders knew that blending those functions invites tyranny. So should we.

Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) is investigating a Virginia school following allegations that a school official “arranged and bankrolled abortions” without parental consent.

Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) directed the Virginia state police to look into the allegations last month.

“As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), I am committed to ensuring parents are empowered with timely access to information necessary to protect their children from the threat of serious harm,” Cassidy wrote. “If these reports are true, they represent a betrayal of Fairfax County parents and families and warrant comprehensive oversight by the HELP Committee to determine how this could have occurred and who must be held accountable.”

A school social worker allegedly helped a 17-year-old girl at Centreville High School to have an abortion, while another girl “fled” an abortion clinic in fear of having an abortion. Fairfax County Public Schools has been accused of hiding the allegations.

“As Chairman of the HELP Committee, I am determined to ensure that federal education funds arenot being misused in violation of the law and parents' rights to protect their children,” he wrote.

“Given the seriousness of the allegations and the potential that federal funds were used by school officials to pressure minor students into receiving covert abortions without parental consent, it is imperative for the Committee to determine whether any federal funds were misused and whether the Hyde Amendment or other relevant laws were violated,” he added.

Astronomers see a mysterious object shining in the deep sky. It could be older than the stars.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

To study the origins of our universe is to struggle with profound chicken-or-egg questions. We know the Big Bang happened. Cosmologists can see its afterglow in the sky. But no one knows whether the laws of physics or even time itself existed before that moment. Nor can we say exactly what happened next. The order in which certain celestial objects formed during the very early universe is hotly contested.

For a long time after the Big Bang, not much of anything could form. All of space was permeated by a roiling plasma. It was too hot and chaotic for any structure to cohere. Hundreds of thousands of years passed before a tiny hydrogen atom could even hold itself together. Another 100 million years or so after that, great clouds of hydrogen condensed and stars flared into being. Most cosmologists believe that these stars were the first large, free-floating structures to illuminate our universe, and that black holes appeared later. But some have proposed that it went the other way around.

In the deep sky, beyond the most ancient fully formed galaxies, astronomers have now found a mysterious and colossal object that may be a primordial black hole. Earlier this month, a team of them posted an analysis of the object based on observations made by the James Webb Space Telescope. If their account holds up, the standard view of how the universe evolved will need serious revamping.

Long before black holes were ever glimpsed in reality, they were theoretical objects, products of the scientific imaginary. In 1783, the English natural philosopher John Michell proposed the existence of “dark stars,” objects of such concentrated mass that light cannot escape their gravity. Michell was reasoning from Newton's laws. More than 100 years later, Karl Schwarzschild and Robert Oppenheimer brought his dark-star idea into alignment with Einstein's theory of general relativity. They showed how an ultradense star could keep collapsing until space-time curved back on itself, sealing off its light in a black hole.

All of this work was done on chalkboards and in notebooks. Black holes would remain notional until 1972, when astronomers confirmed that they'd actually detected one. In the decades that followed, more of these exotic objects were found in every part of the sky. People have now seen small ones and big ones. They have picked up the tiny space-time ripples that emanate outward from two merging black holes. They have learned that most, if not all, galaxies have a black hole at their center. The supermassive one in the middle of the Milky Way shoots out jets of particles that expand into enormous bubbles. These bubbles appear to help regulate star formation and other cosmic processes here in the only galaxy known to host life.

Read: When a telescope is a national-security risk

Most of the black holes that astronomers have identified appear to be collapsed stars. But some theorists, including Stephen Hawking, have suggested that there might be other kinds in the universe. During inflation—an expansive process that theoretically took place just after the Big Bang—quantum fluctuations could have caused large parts of the cosmos to spontaneously buckle inward, forming black holes before any stars had yet appeared. But cosmologists have had trouble imagining the mechanisms that could generate such large fluctuations. If the mysterious object that the James Webb Space Telescope has found really is a primordial black hole, they will have to go back to their chalkboards and notebooks.

That we can even get a peek at something from the early universe is a technological miracle. The Webb telescope spotted this object way out in the dark realm beyond the last visible galaxies, where the only things that glow are likely proto-galaxies and other cosmic bits and bobs in various stages of formation. Even when black holes are close to us, they can be difficult to detect, because they trap light. To see a black hole, astronomers rely on the wrenching violence that it inflicts on nearby matter, which throws off sparks in the form of electromagnetic radiation. But if this object is a black hole too, then not much matter is surrounding it, so it isn't throwing off so many sparks. (In cosmology terms, it's nearly “naked.”) Most of what astronomers see in its vicinity is hydrogen and helium left over from the Big Bang—not what you'd expect from a black hole that had formed from a collapsed star.

Read: Yes, a moon base

We will need many more observations, and probably a larger space telescope, to know for sure whether it's a primordial black hole. After all, our images of this object were taken from clear across the observable universe. They barely qualify as blurry snapshots, and the analysis of them hasn't yet been peer-reviewed. Peter Coles, a theoretical cosmologist at Maynooth University in Ireland, has noted that the object might be some other kind of strange, celestial body instead. Other cosmologists suggested to me that it could be a black hole that formed directly from a gas cloud without having first become a star. It could be something else entirely. At the frontier edge of astronomy, tantalizing new observations have a tendency to be mirages.

We might learn that this one has been misinterpreted. We might find definitive proof that stars are older than black holes, just as cosmologists had long supposed. But even so, black holes would still retain some claim to ontological primacy, because they last so much longer. From their perspective, a star is just a transitory stage, a chrysalis. If the universe continues to expand as cosmologists predict, a day will come when star formation will cease altogether. Tens of trillions of years after that, the final stars will burn out. When that last stellar ember cools and darkens, the age of black holes will still be in its early days. Black holes will exist far, far longer than the entire illuminated age of stars. Of all the forms that this cosmos assumes, they will be among the most enduring. In a deep sense, this universe is theirs.

RFK Jr.'s health policies stem from the idea that the past holds the secret to health and happiness.

The way we respond to the disappointments, dangers, and defects of the present helps determine our political affiliations. If you think the answers lie somewhere in a future condition we've yet to achieve, then you may be persuaded by progressive politics; if you think the resources for rescuing society lie somewhere in the past, you may be attracted to conservative politics.

This general pattern helps explain the recent alignment of conservative politics and the anti-vaccine movement, despite its long-standing association with crunchy, left-ish causes. Today, the two tendencies have joined in mutual agreement about the wholesomeness of natural health versus modern medicine, indulging in nostalgia for a world before the widespread use of vaccines.

The past does contain its share of treasures, and it can be hard to accept that a world so rife with pain and despair is in certain ways the best it has ever been. But the idea that the past held a secret to health and happiness that we've lost somehow—especially with respect to infectious disease—is a fantasy with potentially lethal ramifications.

Read: The neo-anti-vaxxers are in power now

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the vaccine-skeptical current secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, originally shared politics with the older anti-vaccine advocates, back-to-the-Earth types who themselves demonstrated a conservative impulse in their search for a primeval Eden. (Plenty of left-leaning people persist in that tradition, though it seems better fit for today's right, which has a certain appreciation for the pastoral.) A Democrat until 2023, Kennedy entered public life as a champion of environmental protection, battling against corporate interests in court to keep harmful waste out of the air and water. Over time, this overall concern with modern impurity destroying pristine nature evidently extended to other areas of his thinking. As his career progressed, Kennedy adopted several controversial opinions regarding healthy eating, condemning, among other things, meat issued from factory farms, seed oils, and processed food. In a 2024 campaign video from his presidential-primary run, Kennedy promised to “reverse 80 years of farm policy in this country,” harkening to a time before synthetic pesticides and chemical additives to animal feed.

If a conservative is, as William F. Buckley Jr. famously wrote, someone who “stands athwart history, yelling ‘Stop!'” then Kennedy certainly fits the bill. A proper conservative fights to preserve the status quo. But the most reactionary members of the right won't settle for protecting the ground their party has already staked out; their project is to return to the status quo ante, the way things were in the (sometimes distant) past. The slogan “Make America Great Again” manages to disparage the present while promising a return to an era in which Christianity was nationally dominant, manufacturing jobs were the bedrock of the economy, and the country was ever expanding. Kennedy's positions on processed food and pharmaceuticals fit perfectly into that picture.

“Today's children have to get between 69 and 92 vaccines in order to be fully compliant, between maternity and 18 years,” Kennedy said during a recent Senate hearing about Trump's 2026 health-care agenda, by way of comparison with children of the past, who were required to receive fewer vaccines (if any at all). Likewise, Kennedy has rejected the introduction of fluoride into drinking water, a practice initiated in the mid-1940s to help prevent tooth decay, as well as the pasteurization of milk, which began in the late 19th century. “When I was a kid” in the '50s and '60s, Kennedy said earlier this year, “we were the healthiest, most robust people in the world. And today we're the sickest.”

Read: How RFK Jr. could eliminate vaccines without banning them

This is in some respects true, but in other ways dangerously wrong. Kennedy is quick to point out the relative rarity of chronic conditions such as childhood diabetes and autoimmune disorders in the past. But he is apparently hesitant to acknowledge that mid-century America came with its own share of serious health problems, including a high rate of cigarette smoking and horrifying infant mortality rates compared with the present. When Kennedy was young, vaccine-preventable childhood illnesses such as measles routinely killed hundreds annually. So far this year, only three people in the United States have died of measles—largely the result of an outbreak of the disease caused in part by declining vaccination rates. And if modern innovations in food and medicine have come with their share of hazards, it would be wrong to conclude that their predecessors were superior. Raw milk allegedly caused the hospitalization of a toddler and the miscarriage of an unborn child as recently as this summer.

 At the center of the “Make America Healthy Again” crusade is a high degree of trust in the wisdom of nature. But the contemporary appeal of unadulterated nature springs from human successes in controlling the elements; it's hard to romanticize a relatively recent vaccine-free past while considering photographs of children's bodies ravaged by smallpox, a disease that persisted well into the 20th century. Likewise, long before COVID-19, America experienced cholera and flu pandemics with hundreds of thousands of associated deaths, as well as lesser outbreaks of illnesses such as diphtheria, polio, and pertussis, all three of which were notorious child-killers. Today, the rarity of those conditions has fostered a false sense of security, and a naive assessment of the natural world. Relinquishing the successes of general vaccine coverage, however, is guaranteed to belie the idea that untainted nature contains all the keys to health and wellness. Our historical moment has enough strife without revisiting past battles fought and won.

In her debut novel, Addie E. Citchens creates a vibrant Mississippi town and a dire morality tale about the suppression of desire.

Dominion, a fictional town in the Mississippi Delta, is shot through with Black church culture and an outsize reverence for high-school football. At the turn of the millennium, it is a community in which sexuality flourishes despite, or perhaps because of, efforts to suppress it. Addie E. Citchens's debut novel, which takes its setting as its title, follows two women yoked together by their love for a teenager named Emanuel, who more commonly goes by “Wonderboy” or “Wonder”: Diamond, his girlfriend, and Priscilla, his mother and the “first lady” of the local church. Both women, over the course of the novel, desperately try to dislodge themselves from their difficult pasts while confronting a swelling sense of wickedness in Wonder.

Diamond has to grow up quickly when, at 8 years old, she is abandoned, along with three siblings, by her mother. As she enters her senior year with Wonder's baby on the way, she struggles to figure out her identity outside of her relationship with this mysterious boy, who makes increasingly reckless decisions. Priscilla, meanwhile, manages five sons, a philandering know-it-all husband, and a bad hip with the help of brown liquor and what she calls her “fulfillments” (read: pills).

Read: The novelist who truly understood the South

The characters in Dominion are bombarded with religious scripts about what a proper erotic life should look like. But if we know anything about intimacy and desire, we know that they often hold dominion over us rather than the other way around. Many official and informal directives come from Reverend Sabre Winfrey Jr., Priscilla's husband and Wonder's father. The longtime leader of Seven Seals Missionary Baptist Church, he insists on seeing a malignant sexual deviance everywhere. In one of his sermons, he posits that the Bible's “first seducer” altered “the course of human history,” urging his followers to consider what Jesus can tell them about how to “best resist temptation.” Wonder, who sings and plays music at Seven Seals, masters the trumpet rather than his preferred instrument, the saxophone, because, as his father puts it, “a man never oughta put nothing in his mouth but food.” Wonder also confesses that he murdered the family's dachshund because it “kept making my daddy mad.” As Priscilla recalls, the reverend “wasn't too keen on his boys playing with an animal shaped like a ding-a-ling.”

These counterproductive attempts to control sexuality affect the women of Dominion as well. In an early scene, Priscilla walks in on Diamond and her son in an intimate moment. Contemplating where the boy could have learned such impropriety, she recalls the reverend telling her “that because Eve ate the apple, I would have to ‘eat the snake.'” Later, as Diamond registers her embarrassment, she recalls meeting Priscilla years earlier at an event for Finer Womanhood Week that taught young girls “about pads and cramps, how to sit with our ankles crossed, what to wear to keep our bodies from moving under our clothes.”

The book primarily unfolds through first-person observations, toggling between Priscilla and Diamond, both of whom live in awe of Wonder. Diamond sees her relationship with him as “creating something all our own, something I inherently belonged to”—a rare feeling after her family was ripped apart. Priscilla, meanwhile, is disturbed by her son and the “energy that radiated off of him,” which “felt nuclear, dangerous, like someone I didn't and couldn't ever know.” The book also includes church bulletins, church histories, obituaries, and records of Wonder's other dalliances marked by case numbers. These brief accounts of his escapades provide unvarnished views of his often hazy motivations—his search for the “plumpest, most unruly breasts he'd ever come across”; his delight at discovering that another girl's “panties were scratchy and fancy. Harlot red.”

Wonder might have continued to live a more or less nondescript life of church, football, and teenage sex if not for a sudden queer encounter with a man he meets at his school's football stadium. When the stranger catches him off guard with a kiss, Wonder reacts with anger and revulsion. He then violently assaults a homeless man who happened to witness the whole thing. Citchens frames this moment, perhaps the novel's most pivotal, as a high-resolution wide shot from up in the nosebleeds. She tightly choreographs the chance meeting: Wonder “saw and felt lips on his, accepted the tongue crashing about in his mouth. Dude had one hand cradling Emanuel's head; his palm resting on the stranger's strong rippled belly, struggled to decide whether to touch or shove.” Citchens barely describes this other man, giving no sense of who he is or where he's come from. He's simply dark and muscular.

Many readers will want more details on the identity of this shadowy figure who changes the lives of Wonder and the women who love him. But these facts are irrelevant; the man is portrayed as a manifestation of the aberrant sexuality that Dominion's Christian culture seeks to suppress. The kiss causes Wonder to spiral; he reflects on every moment of innocuous intimacy he has shared with a man, “the locker rooms and fanny slaps and chest bumps he'd participated in most of his life.” His vicious outburst warns that when erotic desire is oppressively regulated, it can erupt into something destructive.

Read: The country that tried to control sex

Not long afterward, Wonder and Diamond run away from home, drive six hours to the Mississippi coast, and hole up in a motel room. This interlude is cut short when Diamond finds Wonder sprawled on the ground after having ingested too many pills. She spends the next few days sitting by his hospital bed, vowing to love the incapacitated young man beside her forever.

What Diamond doesn't know at that moment is that the choice won't be hers to make. After his suicide attempt, Wonder starts to pull away from her. Panicking, she wonders how she might emulate what she calls “dangerous women”—those who “had the power to make men risk it all; they brought men to their knees.” When she asks Mrs. Kathareen, a “brown and juicy” woman who is having an affair with the reverend, how to channel the kind of power that will keep a man, the woman ripostes, “Nooooo, baby girl, my only power is that I won't give my power away.”

Diamond isn't immediately sure what Mrs. Kathareen means. But the dam that's been holding back the passions of Dominion has already broken beyond repair, and she'll soon find out. Priscilla tastes liberation first when her husband steps down from the pulpit in a public admission of his extramarital affairs, freeing her to leave him and face her own desires. She urges Diamond, too, to leave her son. “He is no good for anyone, I promise you,” she tells her. “No good for you or a baby.”

Soon after Wonder wakes up from his overdose, Diamond observes: “People rarely just snap and do crazy shit. What looked like a snap to other people was actually an erosion of the surfaces that we built up for protection, and unfortunately people would rather dwell on the snap than the wearing.” Because Dominion takes place over the course of just a few months, the reader witnesses the snaps, but yearns for more of the wearing. Priscilla laments difficult moments in her marriage, but we scarcely see her husband divulge more than phallic anxieties and churchy platitudes. Her drastic decision to leave her old life behind certainly feels warranted, but I would have delighted in a more elaborate depiction of the circumstances that led to her choice.

This quibble arises because I simply wanted more of this book. To paraphrase one of Priscilla's more vivid characterizations of her son, the novel's cabbage feels done, while its cornbread is soft in the middle. Although Dominion is certainly not a romp, it reads perhaps too briskly: The novel's message is clear, but its characters, at times, could use more fleshing out. Then again, this is what makes it a parable—albeit a complicated one, rooted not in dogma but in messy reality.

The Trump administration considers even race-blind admissions policies illegal if they're intended to achieve diversity. 

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

When the Supreme Court struck down race-based affirmative action, it included some words of comfort for Americans worried about declining diversity at the nation's most selective universities. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority in the 2023 case Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, described the goal of creating a diverse student body as “commendable” and “worthy.” He wrote that universities could still consider applicants' stories of how race had affected their lives. Even Justice Clarence Thomas—one of the Court's most ardent opponents of racial preferences—suggested in his concurrence that universities still have numerous paths to maintaining racial diversity, citing the experience of states that had already banned affirmative action. “Race-neutral policies may thus achieve the same benefits of racial harmony and equality without any of the burdens and strife generated by affirmative action policies,” he wrote.

Everyone seemed to be in agreement: Racial preferences were illegal, but promoting diversity by focusing on nonracial factors, such as income or geography, were fair game. The Trump administration, however, feels differently: It argues that even race-neutral admissions policies are illegal if they are intended to achieve racial diversity. And this interpretation is already starting to have an effect.

Earlier this month, the College Board—the nonprofit that administers the SAT—shut down its Landscape tool, which had offered universities detailed data about applicants' environment, including socioeconomic information and educational offerings at their high school. In a vague statement, the organization cited evolving “federal and state policy” as its rationale for the decision. (David Coleman, the CEO of the College Board, declined to answer further questions about the decision.) Edward Blum, the president of Students for Fair Admissions, the group that took down affirmative action, praised the removal of what he called a “disguised proxy for race in the admissions process.” The Trump administration doesn't appear to have the law on its side, but if universities start following the College Board's lead, what the law says might not matter. The era of race-neutral diversity efforts could be over before it begins.

Basing admissions preferences on socioeconomic or geographic factors rather than race was supposed to be the compromise that appeased everyone. In polls, most Americans simultaneously say they support efforts to increase universities' racial diversity but oppose the use of race or ethnicity in admissions. Class-based preferences, in contrast, earn wide support and can further both racial and economic diversity while sidestepping the constitutional issues involved in explicitly considering race. (The Constitution doesn't include any prohibition on treating people differently based on family income or where they grew up.) After Texas banned affirmative action, in 1996, the state's public universities famously began admitting any in-state applicant who graduated in the top 10 percent of their high-school class. (At the flagship University of Texas at Austin, the number will drop to 5 percent next year.) Because Texas's high schools remain largely de facto segregated by race, the program has helped maintain a diverse student body.

In the first admissions cycle after the SFFA ruling, class-based preferences seem to have blunted the impact of the Court's decision. Several top universities managed to keep their demographics roughly the same. (Only the most selective schools had used affirmative action to begin with.) This result was surprising; in briefs submitted to the Court, the universities themselves had predicted catastrophic declines in minority-student enrollment. Richard Kahlenberg, an expert witness for SFFA and a longtime advocate for class-based affirmative action, believes that the universities got their results by placing a greater emphasis on socioeconomic status. Yale, for example, started using data from the Opportunity Atlas, a database run by researchers at Harvard and the U.S. Census Bureau that measures the potential for upward mobility of children who grew up in a given neighborhood. Some schools, including Duke and Dartmouth, reported greater shares of low-income students than before the ruling and relatively stable racial-diversity results, Kahlenberg told me.

Richard Kahlenberg: The affirmative action that colleges really need

Some other observers aren't convinced. Peter Arcidiacono, a fellow expert witness for SFFA, told me that he suspected several universities had flouted the Court's ruling. Blum, the president of SFFA, has suggested that Yale, Princeton, and Duke might be continuing to consider race while pretending not to.

The Trump administration has taken the position that colleges might be breaking the law either way. In February, the Education Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter outlining its interpretation of the SFFA decision. The letter argued that universities cannot use race-neutral proxies in an effort to boost diversity. For example, it claimed that schools' eliminating standardized testing in order to achieve greater racial diversity would be illegal. Organizations including the ACLU sued, arguing that the interpretation in the letter infringed on academic freedom. Courts have since blocked the department from enforcing its interpretation of SFFA.

But the Trump administration has pressed on. In July, Attorney General Pam Bondi released a memo warning universities against the use of race-neutral proxies. “These are not mandatory requirements but rather practical recommendations to minimize the risk of violations,” Bondi wrote. Even so, the memo goes on to declare that the use of “facially neutral criteria” is “legally problematic” if those criteria “are selected because they correlate with, replicate, or are used as substitutes for protected characteristics.” In other words, according to Bondi, a college that chooses to implement place- or income-based preferences in order to help preserve racial diversity would be running afoul of the law.

The Department of Education followed Bondi's memo with a demand for new admissions data on the racial makeup, standardized-test scores, and GPA of applicants and admitted students for all institutions that receive federal student aid. Justin Driver, a Yale Law professor and the author of The Fall of Affirmative Action, told me that he expects any elite college that doesn't start enrolling fewer Black students to be accused by the Trump administration of breaking the law.

The court system has so far been loath to accept the Trump administration's interpretation of SFFA. Last year, the Supreme Court declined to take up two cases that challenged race-neutral proxies in high-school admissions. And proving that race-neutral policies are intended to advantage students of color could be very difficult, Peter Lake, a Stetson University law professor, told me. Universities have shifted toward touting their socioeconomic diversity and test scores, rather than the racial makeup of their incoming classes, he said.

Rose Horowitch: The era of DEI for conservatives has begun

But whether universities would prevail in a hypothetical legal battle may be beside the point. The Trump administration has shown that it is willing to wield the government's formidable power against educational institutions based on a mere accusation of wrongdoing. It has frozen universities' funding for biomedical research and threatened Harvard's nonprofit status without any official investigation. Columbia and Brown have proved themselves willing to settle with the administration even when they probably could have won a court fight. To enact its vision, all the Trump administration needs is for universities to be unwilling to risk government retribution. “It is overpowering for most schools to even imagine taking on the federal government on these issues,” Lake told me. “So the long and the short of it is that their interpretation is the one that drives outcomes.”

Or perhaps universities will find themselves all but forced to fight the executive branch. In May, the Trump administration informed Harvard that the university was under investigation to determine whether it was adhering to the SFFA decision. Last week, the Education Department gave Harvard 20 days to provide documents about its admissions process. Based on settlements with Columbia and Brown, in which those schools agreed to provide data on the race, grades, and test scores of all applicants, the Trump administration appears to be appointing itself the arbiter of what counts as the right and wrong racial makeup of a student body. Universities are always reluctant to go to battle with the federal government. But if the alternative is appointing President Donald Trump as their de facto dean of admissions, they might have no choice.

The president's plans for Memphis resemble the aggressive, showy, and ultimately failed crime-fighting strategy once used by the city's police.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

When President Donald Trump describes his plans to deploy the National Guard to Memphis as a “replica” of what he's done with federal troops in Washington, D.C., he's attempting to make two points: first, that it's appropriate for him to deploy the military in American cities at all, and second, that doing so effectively reduces crime in cities that just happen to be run and disproportionately populated by his perceived political foes. But the vision he has laid out to “make Memphis safe again” is familiar in another key way: It looks a lot like the crime-fighting strategy the city tried just a few years ago—one that ultimately failed.

The president signed an executive memorandum on September 15 directing federal agents to combat street crime in Memphis through “hypervigilant policing,” “aggressive prosecutions,” and “strict enforcement of applicable quality-of-life, nuisance, and public-safety laws.” The memo called for “large-scale saturation of besieged neighborhoods” and highlighted issues such as graffiti, noise, public intoxication, and traffic violations as areas of focus for federal agents set to descend on the city.

All of this sounds remarkably similar to what Memphis tried previously—an effort that, according to the Department of Justice, had disastrous results. “We have reasonable cause to believe that MPD and the City engage in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the Constitution and federal law,” DOJ investigators wrote in a December 2024 report on the Memphis Police Department's activities, sharply rebuking a policing style that managed to antagonize local residents while doing little to solve or prevent violent crime. “First, MPD uses excessive force. Second, MPD makes unlawful stops, searches, and arrests. Third, MPD unlawfully discriminates against Black people when enforcing the law.”

In response to that report—which found that crime had worsened despite the city's constitutionally questionable crackdown—Memphis leaders said they had already intervened to stop the most egregious abuses. But with the support of Tennessee's Republican state leaders, Trump now appears eager to return to the “saturation-style enforcement” that the Justice Department said was effective at arresting thousands of Memphians for traffic violations and nonviolent offenses but abysmal at catching the gang members and other criminals driving the city's high violent-crime rate.

From the July/August 2008 issue: American murder mystery

As Trump redirects his anti-crime crusade to Republican-run states—St. Louis and New Orleans have been floated as targets for future troop deployments—the president is finding little resistance from their governors. This removes a significant obstacle that had complicated his plans to send Guardsmen into Chicago and Baltimore. But Memphis, like other blue cities in conservative states, is a fraught target for other reasons. Although Trump's threats to send Guardsmen into states with a Democratic governor tend to spark unified opposition from state and local leaders, his recent pivot has exposed tensions between state and local officials over race, local control, gun laws, and tax dollars.

JB Smiley Jr., a member of the Memphis City Council, told me he feared that Trump's federal surge would disproportionately target Black residents and undocumented immigrants for petty violations, while doing little to solve serious crimes and address gun violence. “If your goal is to send troops there hoping something goes wrong so that you can send in a more aggressive military occupation, then I think this is what you do,” he said.

Most of the people I spoke with in Memphis acknowledged that the city does have a serious crime problem. Although violence has decreased significantly this year—overall crime is at a 25-year low, police said this month—Memphis ended 2024 with the highest rate of violent crime in the nation, according to FBI data. In recent years, homicides have regularly topped 300 a year in the city of about 630,000—a murder rate that the White House recently noted was four times higher than that of Mexico City. When I asked officials in Memphis why the city's crime rate had remained so high, several pointed to a 2021 state law allowing for permitless open carry of firearms, saying that it has exacerbated gun violence. In November, Memphis residents voted heavily in favor of a referendum opposing permitless gun ownership, although the superseding state law has blocked the city ordinance from going into effect. More than 90 percent of recent murders in the city involved a firearm. Trump's memo on “Restoring Law and Order in Memphis,” however, does not mention gun violence.

Bill Lee, Tennessee's Republican governor, has already begun dispatching dozens of state troopers into Memphis ahead of the expected arrival of federal troops. Lee, who went to the White House last week to personally thank Trump for the troop deployment, said he hoped the effort would result in “sustained crime lowering.” But Lee and the National Guard are still sorting out the details, which has delayed what had been expected to be an imminent deployment. It could be weeks before troops are in Memphis, a Pentagon official speaking on the condition of anonymity told The Atlantic. Among the challenges are federal budgetary concerns due to the end of the fiscal year and a possible government shutdown, the official said.

In the meantime, the state troopers have focused on traffic stops, issuing hundreds of tickets in recent days, local officials told me. The push is reminiscent of a strategy Memphians have become accustomed to—and, in many cases, annoyed with—even as their city has become more violent. Over a five-year period ending in 2023, officers in Memphis issued three times as many tickets as did their counterparts in the more populous city of Nashville, making 800,000 traffic stops and issuing 300,000 tickets, according to the Department of Justice. During that same period, murders in the city increased from 186 to 348 annually.

The strategy resembles one of the tactics federal agents have employed in Washington, D.C., during the surge that began last month. Police checkpoints were set up to stop people for traffic infractions, and officers tended to use the stops as an opportunity to check drivers' immigration status or search for outstanding warrants. White House officials credit the highly visible efforts with bringing down rates of carjackings and other crimes, although criminal-justice experts have suggested that such decreases are likely to be short-lived. “There's certainly literature out there that says increased police presence, in terms of the volume of law-enforcement officers, can reduce crime—but sometimes it doesn't,” Nancy La Vigne, the dean of the Rutgers Newark School of Criminal Justice, told me. “And even if it works in the short run, it can do so much damage to community trust that it's going to hurt in the long run.”

Trust between Memphis residents and law enforcement is already strained, said La Vigne, who led the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice during the Biden administration. She cited the 2023 police killing of Tyre Nichols, who was beaten by several Memphis police officers after a traffic stop. Video footage of Nichols crying for his mother while being punched, kicked, and hit with a baton led to nationwide protests and ultimately forced MPD to disband a street-crime unit that had been known for escalatory practices.

The killing of Nichols, by members of that unit, also drew the attention of the Justice Department. Investigators launched a 17-month investigation of the Memphis police, which culminated in the aforementioned report. It found that Memphis officers would violently retaliate against people who mouthed off at them, punch and kick suspects who were already handcuffed, and engage in stop-and-frisk searches without probable cause. Black Memphians such as Nichols, the department found, were disproportionately targeted for abuse. In May, Trump's DOJ closed its investigation into MPD and retracted the report's findings. The five officers involved in Nichols's death, who are also Black, have each either pleaded guilty or been convicted of various federal and state charges related to the killing. A Tennessee jury acquitted three of the officers on additional charges, including second-degree murder, in May.

Trump has regularly complained that departmental guidelines and constitutional restrictions force police officers to be less “tough” than the criminals they are pursuing. Speaking to New York City cops in 2017, Trump urged them to “please don't be too nice” when making arrests. In recent days, he has repeatedly complained about police officers who stand still and accept a verbal onslaught from protesters yelling in their face. “I say when they spit, you hit,” Trump said at the White House last week, describing his advice to federal officials set to deploy to Tennessee. “You can do whatever you want. You do whatever the hell you want.”

In a statement, the White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson pointed out Memphis's elevated crime rates and asserted that Trump's efforts would reduce them. “Following the President's highly successful operation to combat violent crime in DC, which objectively drove down crime rates across the board, numerous Tennessee officials have applauded the President's decision to address crime in Memphis next,” she wrote. “Just as we did in DC, the Administration will work closely with local law enforcement to ensure the success and sustainability of the operation. Addressing crime will benefit all who live in and visit Memphis.”

The Memphis Police Department and Lee's office did not respond to requests for comment. Trump's push to send what he has called “rough-looking” federal troops into cities such as Memphis raises complex questions of race and class, Russell Wigginton, the president of the Memphis-based National Civil Rights Museum, told me. The museum, located at the site where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, has been a gathering point when the majority-Black city has faced racial tension, he said. “For people of a certain age in Memphis, the connotation of the National Guard is traumatic—because they go straight back to imagery of Dr. King on that balcony in front of room 306,” he said, noting that thousands of Guardsmen deployed to the city before and after King's murder, in 1968.

Read: The murders in Memphis aren't stopping

Memphis's mayor, its police chief, and most of the city's officers are Black. The group of leaders Trump assembled last week at the White House to announce the “Memphis Safe Task Force” and discuss the city's future—Lee, Senators Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, and a cadre of Cabinet officials—were almost exclusively white. Several Memphians I spoke with flagged the dynamic as troubling. Wigginton called it “jarring.”

City leaders have said they would welcome federal help to combat violent crime, particularly to address Memphis's low clearance rates for the most serious offenses. Memphis police arrested a suspect in only 28 percent of murders in 2022 and 14 percent of murders in 2023, well below the national rate of 50 percent, according to FBI data. The clearance rates for nonfatal shootings have been even lower. Given the seriousness of the crime problem, Trump's memo highlighting “public intoxication” and “unpermitted disturbances and demonstrations” has led to a fair share of eye rolling among local officials, Tami Sawyer, the general-sessions court clerk for Shelby County, which includes Memphis, told me. “They're going to come arrest people for vagrancy and loitering and noise and graffiti, but they're not going to take the guns out of circulation,” said Sawyer, who oversees much of the operation for the misdemeanor court cases and the jail in downtown Memphis.

She said that the jail is already overcrowded and the air-conditioning in one of the buildings went out earlier this month, leaving those inside to broil during 90-degree days. “We're lucky that we haven't had a riot yet,” she told me.

The Trump administration has done little to coordinate with local officials. Whereas Trump had the power to seize control of the D.C. police department and could rely on federal prosecutors to embrace his approach to charging crimes, the president's authority is more limited outside the nation's capital. A spokesperson for Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy, who would be responsible for deciding whether to charge many of the people swept up in any crackdown, told me last week that he was still waiting to receive a briefing from the Trump administration.

Memphis Mayor Paul Young said he learned of Trump's decision to deploy troops when the president made the announcement on Fox News. Young has said he opposes the idea. Several officials have pointed out that the Trump administration abruptly cut a $1.7 million grant for a local nonprofit focused on violence prevention, and will likely spend many times that amount on the troop deployment.

Meanwhile, residents told me that they have little choice but to wait and see whether the presence of soldiers once again marching through their city will deter crime or only further inflame tensions.

“Memphis has its problems just like any other city—but we're not just this dystopia of foolishness and violence and crime,” Justin Brooks, who handles student recruitment for Christian Brothers University in Memphis, told me. “I hope that while the Guard is stationed here, that it actually benefits us. That's the biggest thing. We fought enough about Is it going to happen? Now it's going to happen, and it's like, What now?”

An emotional monologue, a takedown of Trump, and a victory for individual action.

Our great national censorship nightmare is over — but only for about three-quarters of the ABC stations in America.

Jimmy Kimmel was back on the air Tuesday night after Disney, the parent company of ABC, reversed its decision last week to suspend his talk show over comments he made about MAGA supporters' response to the killing of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk. That initial pause came after increasing pressure from the Trump administration and two TV station groups — Nexstar and the conservative-leaning Sinclair — which said last week they would not air Kimmel's show.

Whether or not you like Kimmel, his show's return Tuesday night was a triumph for a few reasons. First, it was a victory for free speech: the return of a show that was taken off the airwaves in part because of oblique threats from the Trump-era Federal Communications Commission's leadership, and the rebuffing of what my colleague Zack Beauchamp has called a “climate of fear and censorship” in the wake of Kirk's death, championed by conservative activists.

Second, it was also a new kind of (partial) victory for liberals and their resistance efforts in the second Trump term.

Led by celebrities, podcasters, influencers, and the grassroots — as opposed to any institutions, corporations, billionaires, or political parties — it managed to get a major corporation to resist Trump and restore Kimmel, even though his show is only returning to about three-quarters of the ABC-affiliated TV stations in America.

While a variety of voices pushed back against this attempt at corporate censorship, Nexstar and Sinclair continued to boycott Kimmel's show last night — airing local news segments instead of Jimmy Kimmel Live! in the nearly 25 percent of local ABC affiliates across the country that they own. They don't show signs of reversing course yet. And it's not clear what mechanism — if any — Kimmel supporters have to influence either corporation to change its policy for now.

Tuesday night's monologue might end up being the moment Kimmel revived this new type of resistance — or it might get lost in another wave of Trump-induced news and scandal. It will surely be one of his best-rated shows. He came out swinging against Trump, his efforts to punish his critics, and the FCC's chief, Brendan Carr. Kimmel didn't directly apologize — and instead made an impassioned case for further Trump resistance, called in surprise guest (and Trump archenemy) Robert De Niro, and joked about Trump's physical appearance and the likelihood of an Epstein Files drop “to distract us from this now. … He tried his best to cancel me, instead he forced millions of people to watch the show. That backfired bigly.”

His case against Trump was simple. “The president of the United States made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs. Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods because he can't take a joke,” he said, holding back tears throughout the address. “A government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn't like is anti-American. There is some solidarity on that from the right and the left and those in the middle. Maybe the silver lining from this is we found one thing we can agree on, and maybe we'll even find another one.”

No less potently, Kimmel didn't identify as a liberal or a Democrat when attacking Trump, but as an American. Kimmel, who joked that he barely paid attention in school, said he never expected to be in his current position — fighting a war of principle against a would-be American despot — but that he was taught by comedians such as Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, and Howard Stern that censoring comedians is “un-American.” This was not a progressive or a liberal's cry of rage; Kimmel attacked Trump from the absolute dead-center.

Although Kimmel came out strong in his return, there are still other obstacles to reclaiming his former audience. Sinclair and Nexstar are continuing their boycott of his show, setting up a potential showdown with Disney and ABC in the coming days. Sinclair's position seems ideological — demanding Kimmel apologize to Kirk's family and make a “meaningful” contribution to Kirk's activist group Turning Point USA. Nexstar argues that Kimmel's speech was harmful — though the company has a deal merging with Tegna, another major station owner, pending before Trump's FCC.

Combined, their stations reach nearly a quarter of the American viewing public — meaning millions of Americans (in cities like Washington, DC, Nashville, Salt Lake City, Seattle, and St Louis) who might want to watch Kimmel's show simply can't turn on their televisions and do so (I, for one, had to watch his monologue on a clandestine TikTok livestream from my phone).

Kimmel noted much of this during his monologue — citing pressure on affiliates in cities to not air his show and the slippery slope it might create in the future: “Should the government be able to regulate which podcasts the cellphone companies and wifi providers are allowed to let you download to make sure they serve the public interest?” His studio audience responded with a resounding, “No!” Kimmel and the decision-makers at the Mickey Mouse company might be hoping the rest of the country will keep feeling this way — but who knows if this fracas will be remembered beyond being just one more Trump scandal.

As the first few months of the second Trump term have shown, other major companies, law firms, universities, and organizations have acquiesced in the face of confrontation with the president. And massive street protests have been absent.

That's part of what makes this moment of individual-led backlash seem so noteworthy — and one reason why it's not clear that it can be replicated. Kimmel raised this specter Tuesday night too, noting Trump's apparent desire to go after late-night comics specifically will probably continue.

“Somehow, [he was able to] squeeze Colbert out of CBS, then he turned his sights on me, and now he's openly rooting for NBC to fire Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers and the hundreds of Americans who work for their shows,” he said. “And I hope that if that happens, or if there's even any hint of that happening, you will be 10 times as loud as you were this week. We have to speak out against this. He is not stopping. And it's not just comedy. He's gunning for our journalists too.”

In the week or so that Kimmel was off the air, the strongest efforts to push back against Trump and conservative efforts to censor Kimmel did not come from corporations, the stock market, or a major political institution. Instead, it was primarily driven by “talent” — actors, comedians, podcasters, and other individuals with a built-in audience and a public platform.

It came from the hundreds of Hollywood movie stars, comedians, and other celebrities who signed open letters: one from the ACLU with more than 400 A-list signers, including De Niro, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, and Lin-Manuel Miranda; and another of more than 600 comedians, including Rosie O'Donnell, Kathy Griffin, and Chelsea Handler.

It was musicians like Sarah McLachlan, Jewel, and Olivia Rodrigo who backed out of promotional events and appearances for Disney-backed projects, and at least one TV writer who said they wouldn't work with Disney in protest. It was current and past Marvel stars posting critically about Disney and free speech to their followers (Marvel Studios is owned by Disney).

And it was other current or former late-night and TV show hosts like Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, Jimmy Fallon, David Letterman, and Seth Meyers that dedicated their monologues, segments of their shows, or in-person appearances over the last week to pillory Trump and the FCC, and to support Kimmel.

It was “a blatant assault on freedom of speech,” Colbert, whose own show is being scrapped under dubious circumstances, warned in his monologue last week. “We all see where this is going. … You can't go around firing somebody because you're fearful or trying to suck up to an authoritarian — a criminal — administration in the Oval Office,” Letterman warned at a festival appearance last week. “It is possible to stand up to this kind of bullying and censorship,” Meyers said to his own audience on Monday night.

Even some of the podcasters and new media stars that often sympathize with MAGA voiced concerns over the last week. “Manosphere” influencers like the comedians Andrew Schulz and Akaash Singh spent time on their show and on social media explaining why conservatives should be outraged. Meanwhile, media personalities at the sports and pop culture brand Barstool Sports debated each other on whether the suspension was, in fact, government censorship.

And though it took him some time to record an episode and he didn't call out Trump by name, Joe Rogan, probably the most vocal “free speech” defender of the podcasting world, ultimately criticized the FCC, too, and warned those cheering Kimmel's silencing that the same powers could be used on them in the future on Tuesday.

Individually, each of these statements, posts, and actions reached very different segments of the American public; in today's siloed media and information ecosystem, perhaps none of them share an audience. But combined, they helped to spur on a tidal wave of pressure and criticism on Disney, its leadership, and its bottom line. Many of these same celebrities helped to encourage grassroots cancellations and boycotts of Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions, as well as its theme parks — which seem to have actually caused some economic damage.

Kimmel referenced almost all of this during his opening monologue last night: He thanked his fellow comedians; he joked about the mass subscription cancellations; he thanked those “people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” including Rogan, Sen. Ted Cruz, and other conservative media voices. And he set himself up to be, if only for one night, Hollywood's Resistance leader.

Of course, Trump weighed in before Kimmel even started speaking with another threat: “I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative,” he posted on Truth Social.

In the meantime, Disney will continue to allow streaming subscribers to watch Kimmel on Hulu (whose price is about to get higher), even if Nexstar and Sinclair-run local affiliates maintain their refusal to play his show on their stations. And while ABC and Disney's brass may feel they deserve some credit for Kimmel's reinstatement — Kimmel thanked them for bringing him back and supporting his show over the years, though “unfortunately, and I think unjustly, this puts them at risk” — the extent of their willingness to fight Trump and a weaponized FCC remain open questions.

The killing of Charlie Kirk could turn the movement into a faith that outlives Donald Trump.

Charlie Kirk has been turned into the first martyr of the MAGA faith. And this matters because it is martyr veneration that helped both Christianity and Islam transform from small local movements centered on charismatic preachers into global religions. In launching its own martyrs, MAGA may be moving from a movement focused on one beguiling leader in the person of Donald Trump to a broader faith that could outlast him.

Since the assassination, a variety of MAGA-foe pundits have compared the MAGA response to Kirk's murder — including Stephen Miller's convenient claim that Kirk's last message to him was a call to “dismantle the radical Left” — to the response to the killing of Horst Wessel, a German Nazi murdered by two members of Communist Party of Germany in 1930. In the hands of Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, Wessel's death became a rallying cry, and Wessel himself a heroic martyr whose death symbolized the Nazi struggle against Communism. Goebbels had Wessel mythologized through songs, rallies, and public ceremonies, creating a cult around him that galvanized support for the Nazi movement.

The comparisons to Horst Wessel are not without merit. His death was a major boon for Nazi propaganda, just as Kirk's death has given MAGA and the Trump administration proximate cause to escalate attacks on their political adversaries. But those comparisons miss something crucial. Goebbels himself was consciously drawing on an earlier model, and it is that model, the Late Antique cult of the martyrs, that the MAGA faithful are now, consciously or not, also invoking.

Until now, the evangelical Christianity that Kirk embraced — and still the default mode of worship for American Christian nationalists — has had only a tenuous relationship with martyrdom. There have been powerful stories, to be sure: Cassie Bernall, the teenager at Columbine who supposedly declared her faith before being shot, or John Allen Chau, the young missionary killed on North Sentinel Island. But these episodes are remembered as isolated moments of witness-inspiring stories of faith, rather than built into an ongoing culture of veneration as evidenced by the official support for the efforts to celebrate Kirk's memory, including from the president of the United States. Evangelicals have often been suspicious of martyr-saints in part because this brand of martyr veneration smacks of “works” and Catholic hagiography rather than the Evangelical emphasis on personal salvation.

That reluctance has been a weakness, because martyrs inspire the faithful, galvanize movements, and spread a message far more effectively than any sermon. After all, what better evidence of truth than that there were hundreds, nay thousands, prepared to die in witness to that truth?

As MAGA's first martyr, the myth being crafted around Kirk both mirrors that of earlier religions' martyrs while still bearing the unique marks of the MAGA faith.

In fact, while it is now common to claim that Christians were relentlessly persecuted by the Roman Empire, in recent years this idea has been widely challenged. Scholars like Candida Moss have convincingly argued that while individual Christians were persecuted and occasionally killed for their beliefs, the idea of persistent and widespread persecution was largely an invention of Christians themselves. Researchers have argued that stories of Christian persecution were insidiously crafted not just to inspire the faithful, but also to silence and shame nonconformists and keep the churches funded.

In a similar vein, the MAGA movement, ever resourceful and idiosyncratic, has seemingly turned to the medieval Christian traditions, creating a martyr who would be at home in any sixth-century book or church. And as MAGA's first martyr, the myth being crafted around Kirk both mirrors that of earlier religions' martyrs while still bearing the unique marks of the MAGA faith, including the reshaping of the Pentecostal Kirk into a generic “Christian,” who really loved America, by the way.

On September 9, Kirk had been a member of the MAGA manosphere, a community college dropout who argued with college students. The co-founder and face of the conservative activist group Turning Point USA, Kirk entered the national political scene as a teenager. At that time, he was part of what was even then a dying breed of secular American conservative, and, at least publicly, did not show much interest at all in religion, except to urge his fellow conservatives to respect the separation of church and state. Then, in 2021, Kirk partnered with Rob McCoy, the senior pastor of Godspeak Calvary Chapel in Thousand Oaks, California, to found TPUSA Faith, a faith-based version of Turning Point. This was part of an increasingly religious tenor in Kirk's public statements and views; however, on September 9, few would have thought of Kirk as primarily — or even particularly — a religious figure.

Yet, the moment he was pronounced dead that began to change: Alongside portrayals of Kirk as a defender of free speech, there was the explicitly religious veneration and storytelling. All over the MAGA internet, and even in reactionary circles abroad, people said: Kirk was an evangelist, even a modern-day John the Baptist. His death will be the impetus for revival. Mainstream media repeated the claim that Kirk wanted Christianity to be his legacy. And official White House social media, too, referred to his memorial as a “revival.” The hagiography of Charlie Kirk had begun.

It's especially clear that Kirk is being made into a martyr for the MAGA movement because he's being celebrated as a generic “Christian.” In the process, his real religious background is blurred or even completely ignored. Kirk's wife, Erika, is a Roman Catholic and Kirk has had nice things to say both about Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox Christians. But make no mistake: Charlie Kirk himself, to the extent he had developed an adult religious identity over the past five years, was a Pentecostal, a particularly evangelical brand of Christianity.

Yet that hasn't stopped both the reactionary American Catholic Cardinal Timothy Dolan from comparing Kirk to a “modern-day St. Paul.” Nor, most bizarrely of all, has it prevented Metropolitan Tikhon Shevkunov, an influential bishop in the Russian Orthodox Church known as “Putin's Confessor,” from calling Kirk's death “martyric” and declaring that Kirk “is truly effective in missionary work.” On social media and message boards, traditionalist Catholics and Eastern Orthodox Christians have declared with certainty that Kirk would have converted to their favored church if only permitted to live a bit longer, he was “interested” after all, although he never gave any real indication of any pending conversion (and many evangelical influencers have pushed back against this idea). It is a blurring of lines Kirk might have approved of. He has an upcoming book advocating that Christians adopt the Jewish practice of keeping the Sabbath, putting him in a long line of evangelicals who co-opt Jewish practice to their own ends.

In this movement, theology is bent to serve the nation, and churches exist to strengthen an America defined by nationalism, whiteness, and loyalty to Trump.

The conflation of Kirk's religious identity, both by him and his would-be hagiographers, makes most sense when placed within the larger story of how MAGA is remaking religion itself. For decades, the religious right sought to apply Christian scripture to American life; they were traditionalists, often theocrats, who wanted the law to conform to the church. But Trump's new religious right reverses that relationship. In this movement, theology is bent to serve the nation, and churches exist to strengthen an America defined by nationalism, whiteness, and loyalty to Trump. The Religious Liberty Commission — packed not with the mainline Protestants that have dominated American religious life but with evangelicals, conservative Catholics, Orthodox Jews, and even Muslim converts — makes this explicit: It is not doctrine that binds them but a shared sense of cultural siege.

That is why Kirk's memory works best for the movement if he is treated not as a Pentecostal, but as a generic “Christian” and specifically as a Christian whose Christian faith was explicitly tied to the MAGA cause. Theological specifics — once so divisive between Catholics, evangelicals, and Orthodox — matter far less than political utility. In a movement that builds theology to fit politics, Kirk can be cast as an evangelical evangelist, a Catholic saint, or even a hero for Russian Orthodoxy, because the point is not religious accuracy but political cohesion.

And frankly, the generalization of Kirk's religious identity is only possible because he was part of the MAGA faithful and came to his faith that way. Thus, it was a “MAGA Christianity.” Take, for example, Kirk's praise of the role of the Virgin Mary in Catholicism, which Catholics and Orthodox have cited as proof he would have eventually joined them. Kirk had not come to believe in the intercessory powers of Mary or been bowled over by the countless Marian miracles that dot the history of Christianity. No, Kirk thought the veneration of Mary was an antidote to “toxic feminism,” teasing in his noncommittal way it might even be enough to make him convert.

Oddly, those social media commentators desperate to be Kirk's co-religionists might be on to something. On the surface, the memorial for Kirk on Sunday in Arizona has largely been noted for its evangelical character. And it is true, the event had contemporary Christian worship music and plenty of pleas for people to “read their Bibles,” subtle hints to experience the personal conversion at the heart of evangelicalism. But these aspects of evangelical worship and theology have long found their way into other parts of Christianity. Charismatic Catholics exist. And what took place at Kirk's memorial, from the speeches to the memorabilia, was not simply evangelical enthusiasm. It echoed much older patterns, drawn straight out of Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, eras that predate evangelicalism altogether.

First, there is the much-discussed contrast between the speeches given by Erika Kirk and Donald Trump. As many progressive commentators have pointed out, Erika Kirk said she forgave her husband's killer. She was followed by the president, who immediately called for revenge. Both drew applause from the crowd.

This may simply reflect an audience willing to cheer anything, but it also echoes the world of the medieval saint. In that world, the virtuous woman, often a virgin or widow, pleads for mercy and forgiveness for the saint's persecutors, while the strong Christian king seeks vengeance. The idea was central to medieval notions of queenship. It is a model that allows the language of Christian mercy to coexist with the harsh realities of authoritarian rule, which is exactly what MAGA is aiming for. It was also a model that allowed for women to have a significant public role while not transgressing normative ideas of femininity. Say, for example, Erika Kirk becoming the CEO of Turning Point USA.

Then, there's the merch: hats, T-shirts, and cups sold bearing images of Kirk with a halo above his head or walking hand in hand with Christ in paradise; these would find more home in medieval Catholicism than among idol-fearing Evangelicals. These are all part of medieval Christianity, a pre-evangelical way of making and celebrating a martyr. It is a way of celebrating the saints that the evangelicals of the MAGA faith have seemingly embraced, a part of Catholicism they have embraced despite the theological contradictions.

The earliest Christians celebrated the Eucharist over the tombs of martyrs. To this day, the relics of saints are buried in the altars of Orthodox and Catholic churches. That is how central the cult of the martyrs was to the early Christian churches' self-understanding, even if most of the stories were simply made up. Today, the religious movement that is being built in America at this moment is as dangerous and unprecedented as its new politics. And, just like Christianity two millennia ago, this new MAGA faith is going to need martyrs for all the reasons Christianity did: to inspire the faithful, punish dissenters, and keep the money flowing.

Martyrs made Christianity more than a small sect that would soon die out like so many before and after it; they made it a religion, offering the movement the political tools to grow and consolidate. The MAGA movement has, consciously or not, learned from this history.

Decoding online “psychobabble” with a real therapist.

Joe Nucci, like many brand-new therapists, loved showing off his fancy new psychology vocabulary during grad school. All these diagnoses and concepts were exciting, Nucci says, and helped explain so much. But as he continued his schooling, he realized that applying those terms in everyday life could be perilous.

Some self-help creators online could use a bit of that wisdom. As the stigma surrounding mental health has waned over the last 10 years, an influx of well-meaning influencers and consumers looking to understand more about themselves may have bought into flattened descriptions of popular terms — like boundaries or narcissism — or have internalized simplistic ideas about their emotions. “I was noticing that not only was some of it just technically incorrect, but it was being explained or applied in a way that ultimately was harmful,” Nucci says. “If people were taking that advice too literally or without the important missing nuance, it could lead to decisions that would actually hurt mental health and not help it.”

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

So Nucci, a licensed psychotherapist in private practice with over 250,000 followers on Instagram, set out to dispel some of those myths — to correct the therapy-speak that has come to dominate mental health. In Psychobabble: Viral Mental Health Myths and the Truths to Set You Free, Nucci outlines over three dozen misconceptions that have rampantly circulated online. Here, he discusses seven of the most pervasive, how we got here, and how to fight back.

Over the last decade or so, Nucci has noticed discussions around diagnoses morph from “You have X disorder” and “You are so much more than a label” to “almost a personality feature,” he says. Diagnoses are best utilized to inform a treatment plan to promote better functioning, Nucci says. But when people wear their diagnoses like a label, it may become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Those with ADHD, for example, may run late because they are distracted, he explains. “With the right medication, with the right mindset shifts, with the right coaching and executive functioning training, you can actually minimize how often you run late and to the point where you're not running late any more than the typical person,” he says. But if you believe running late is an unchangeable facet of your personality, you may make the symptoms worse and close yourself off to improvement.

Instead of relying on one term to define yourself, Nucci suggests highlighting many of your qualities using a variety of words: creative, outgoing, scatterbrained at times. “We need to be using more language,” he says, “not less.”

Nucci takes issue with the term “people pleaser” because it isn't specific and could refer to any number of behaviors. “Are you going along with things and then elevating your sense of moral superiority?” he says. “Are you self-sacrificing for one reason or another?” Some people may just be more agreeable than others and take pleasure when deferring to loved ones.

So-called people pleasing becomes problematic when it's motivated by conflict aversion — you're afraid of upsetting a friend so you don't voice your opinion even when you want to. In his own life, Nucci has been working on standing his ground and trying not to assume others are mad at him — he's been open with friends and family about it. “People, overall, were really supportive,” he says.

Like many pop psychology-related concepts, the widely accepted definition of “love bombing” has shifted. Originally intended to refer to a manipulation tactic where love and affection are used to control another person, the understanding of love bombing tends to point to any relationship that's progressing quickly. “There are so many reasons why people move fast in dating,” Nucci says: lust, infatuation, falling for an idea of a person, confused expectations.

Just because someone has intense feelings early in a relationship doesn't necessarily mean they're attempting to manipulate their romantic partner.

Other popular mental health-related terms have also followed a similar trajectory: think about the social media posts you've seen referring to people as “toxic” or “narcissists.”

As for love bombing, just because someone has intense feelings early in a relationship doesn't necessarily mean they're attempting to manipulate their romantic partner. Nor does taking a pause to slow things down if you're considering whether to continue dating after the initial infatuation has worn off.

Inspired by a metaphor he often saw online — “A flower isn't doing well. Do you blame the flower, or do you blame the quality of the soil, the air, the sunlight?” — Nucci believes both systemic societal issues and personal autonomy play a role in mental health. Racism, sexism, discrimination, and any number of systemic issues have certainly impacted his patients, Nucci says, but it's important for mental health practitioners to remember their patients have agency, too.

Sometimes, repeatedly reminding people of all the ways the world is unfair may prevent them from seeing a way forward. “If you're on the really extreme end of prioritizing systemic justice,” Nucci says, “there's going to be situations in which you could actually do something as an individual. You don't want to be so rigid in that stance that you miss the easy wins of stuff you can do and stuff that you can work on.”

At the same time, it is important to acknowledge external forces you can't control. Being wholly committed to the idea that you can change your circumstances if you just work hard enough might only lead to burnout, exhaustion, and frustration. “You're not actually advancing towards the goals that you value,” Nucci says. “Is it adaptive of you to take a step back, to take a deep breath and look at your context, look at the system that you're in? Maybe that's your family, maybe that's your culture or country. … That can also be really, really healing.”

Becoming an amateur expert in mental health concepts doesn't equate with healing, Nucci says. In therapy, counselors typically begin by helping patients name their experiences, process them, and analyze them, he explains. “Sometimes, when people are able to articulate a cogent analysis, their symptoms go away — not always, but sometimes,” Nucci says. “At that point you want to stop analyzing, because if you continue, it quickly becomes obsessing, ruminating.”

In which case, learning more or digging deeper emotionally might not help. Instead, therapists could turn their approach to other forms of treatment, like cognitive behavioral therapy, which focuses on shifting thought patterns, or behavioral therapy, where you work on changing your actions. Suffice to say, endlessly trying to learn about mental health concepts and terminology online can also become counterproductive outside of a therapeutic environment.

Most people differ in how open and vulnerable they expect their romantic relationships to be. Some want their significant other to be extremely expressive and raw; others might not be comfortable divulging everything to their spouse. You shouldn't feel bad if you don't want to tell your partner what you'd tell your therapist. “The type of intimacy that you would give your therapist, the types of details, the types of stuff you would talk about, I would not necessarily recommend speaking to your partner that way,” Nucci says.

The same goes for your children. Just because you'd confide in a friend about trauma from your past doesn't mean it's necessarily appropriate to disclose that to your kids.

Vulnerability is important in close relationships, but it doesn't mean you have to be totally vulnerable with every person you meet. “Maybe only one person gets that vulnerability with you,” Nucci says. “Maybe it's your partner, maybe it's your therapist, maybe it's a friend.”

While therapists are certainly qualified to treat patients on their mental health journeys, they are not “wise sages” on all topics, Nucci says, especially love. Therapy can help you identify unhelpful patterns in relationships and give you skills to help fix them, but it won't replace the experience of actually dating.

“You've got to learn to put yourself back out there, and that's all any of us can do,” Nucci says. “If that's something you're struggling with, therapy can be a great intermediate support for you, but I think it's inaccurate to say that it will make you completely ready.”

Business Insider Edition 

Eswatini recently disclosed that it had repatriated a Jamaican native who had been sent to the Southern African country from the United States under the Donald Trump third-country immigration policy.


        In July, the U.S deported five third-country nationals to Eswatini as part of its campaign against illegal immigration.
    


        Orville Isaac Etoria, a Jamaican who was part of the group, has now been sent back to his home country, according to a statement by the Eswatini government.

        The statement added that Mr. Etoria, 62, was ""warmly welcomed by members of his family"" following his voluntary repatriation over the course of the weekend.
    


        ""Mr Etoria has safely returned to Jamaica, where he was warmly welcomed by members of his family,"" said the Eswatini government statement issued on Monday.
    


        The Legal Aid Society of New York, however, has reproved his treatment, claiming that Etoria entered the US as a minor and maintained legitimate permanent residency status there for many years.
    


        The rest of the deportees to the small Southern African country, originally from Cuba, Laos, Vietnam, and Yemen, are still being held there.
    


        As seen on the BBC, these men are being detained in solitary confinement in a maximum security prison in the capital city, Mbabane, after being described as ‘depraved monsters' by the U.S government.
    


        Originally, the country stated that the deportees were being kept in separate jail facilities pending repatriation procedures.
    


        The legal representatives for the four deportees still in Eswatini claim they have been unable to get in touch with them.
    


        But Eswatini disclosed that it is working to repatriate them all.
    


        In July, a deportation flight carrying immigrants from Yemen, Cuba, Laos, Vietnam, and Jamaica landed in Eswatini.
    


        The flight had been authorized by the US Department of Homeland Security under the revised regulation that allows illegal migrants to be deported to countries other than their home of origin.

        The Trump administration was able to continue deporting migrants without providing them an opportunity to prove that they were being persecuted or injured because of a June ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court.
    


        U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin described five of the deported individuals as ""depraved monsters"" in a tweet on X.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Business leaders, including Jensen Huang, Sam Altman, and Jamie Dimon, react to Trump's H-1B visa fee","https://www.businessinsider.com/business-leaders-react-trump-h-1b-visa-fee-2025-9","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 03:14:00 GMT","

Business leaders such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Netflix chairman Reed Hastings have been weighing in on President Donald Trump's new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas.

The US issues roughly 85,000 new H-1B visas via a lottery system every year. The H-1B program is highly popular among US companies looking to hire foreign workers for in-demand roles such as tech and engineering.

On Friday, Trump signed an executive order raising the H-1B visa application fee by $100,000. The White House told Business Insider that the fee would only apply to new applicants, not those renewing their H-1B visas.

Do you have experience with the H-1B visa program? Business Insider wants to hear from you. Please fill out this quick form.

The sudden move has sparked concerns among Big Tech firms like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, whose workers are on H-1B visas. All three companies told their employees on the visa not to leave the US or to quickly return to the country if they were overseas.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed optimism about Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee during an interview with CNBC on Monday.

""We want all the brightest minds to come to the US, and remember immigration is the foundation of the American dream. And we represent the American dream,"" Huang said in a joint interview with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

The pair announced on Monday that Nvidia was making a $100 billion investment in OpenAI.

""Immigration is really important to our company and is really important to our nation's future, and I'm glad to see President Trump making the moves he's making,"" Huang added.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the Trump administration's introduction of a $100,000 fee to the H-1B visa program was the right move.

""We need to get the smartest people in the country, and streamlining that process and also sort of aligning financial incentives seems good to me,"" Altman told CNBC during his joint interview with Jensen Huang on Monday.

Netflix cofounder and chairman Reed Hastings praised Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee, calling it a ""great solution"" compared to the existing lottery system.

Hastings said in an X post on Sunday that he has ""worked on H-1B politics for 30 years.""

""It will mean H1-B is used just for very high-value jobs, which will mean no lottery needed, and more certainty for those jobs,"" he wrote.

""Shark Tank"" star Kevin O'Leary said the $100,000 fee on H-1B visas would hurt American companies and limit their access to talent.

""Apple, Oracle, Google all started in a garage. They could have not afforded to do this. And all of those companies took advantage of talent they couldn't find in the United States as they grew,"" O'Leary told Fox Business's ""Varney & Co."" on Monday.

""I think what this does is hurt innovation long-term. I agree that it's going to push these really talented people into other countries,"" he added.

O'Leary said that the US government should, in fact, be paying foreign graduates to stay and work in the US.

""Why train them and kick them out? And if they're available, let's take them all and not charge a 100 grand. We should give them a 100 grand to come here,"" he said.

Ark Invest's Cathie Wood said Trump's new H-1B visa fee could be a part of his administration's negotiation strategy with India.

In August, Trump raised US tariffs on Indian goods to 50% from 25%. He wrote in a Truth Social post on August 4 that this was because India was not only ""buying massive amounts of Russian Oil"" but also ""selling it on the Open Market for big profits.""

The US and India are in the middle of trade negotiations. More than 70% of all H-1B visa holders come from India.

""It's a negotiation with India. Longer term, I think President Trump and his team want to keep as much innovation, talent, and technology talent as possible in the US,"" Wood said in an interview with Bloomberg on Monday.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the executive order was a rule change that ""caught everyone off guard.""

In an interview with CNBC this week, Dimon said he supports ""merit-based immigration "" and expects employers who rely on the program to object to the president's executive order.

""I would beg the president,"" he said. ""He has accomplished border control, that's great, I mean, I think all nations want real border control, that helps make a nation, but after that, we should have good immigration,"" he said.

A Business Insider analysis earlier this year showed that JPMorgan is a top user of H-1B visas. It ranked first on a list of financial companies that use them.

Royal Bank of Canada's CEO Dave McKay said the US President's move to impose a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas is a win for Canada.

In an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, McKay called the rule a ""material opportunity"" for Canada to attract more skilled tech workers. He said the country should capitalize on it to accelerate growth in its innovation sector.

""So from India or from South Asia or from Europe, they'll say, 'Well, I can't get into the US, but I want to move to North America — I'll come to Canada,'"" McKay said.

The RBC chief added that the Canadian government could lower taxes to make it more attractive to launch and grow businesses.

CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said that his company, like other tech firms, depends on talented individuals to help ""build and drive"" technology forward.

""Anytime you add an additional fee to it, it does serve as sand in the gears,"" Intrator said in an appearance on CNBC on Monday.

""Some sand in the gears is acceptable. It is going to be the competitive landscape and we will comply with it,"" he said. ""But it does decelerate access to certain talents.""

Amazon's AI coding assistant Q Developer saw revenue fall behind rivals in its first year, prompting the company to reassess its broader branding plans, Business Insider has learned.

As of late April, a full year since its launch, Q Developer's projected annual recurring revenue was $16.3 million, according to an internal document obtained by BI. The forecast was based on roughly $317,000 in weekly revenue and $1.25 million over the trailing 4-week period.

ARR is a common industry metric that extrapolates weekly or monthly revenue streams into an annualized figure.

Q Developer's growth might have stood out in earlier years, but it looks modest in today's rapidly accelerating AI industry, according to Jason Lemkin, managing director of SaaStr Fund.

For instance, Anysphere's Cursor coding tool crossed $500 million in ARR in June after reaching $100 million earlier this year. Another popular AI coding assistant Windsurf reported $82 million in ARR in July, less than a year into its launch. Even younger AI startups like Gamma and Higgsfield hit $50 million in ARR in less than a year, underscoring Q Developer's comparatively slower growth, Lemkin said.

""It's not as jaw-dropping as it used to be,"" Lemkin told BI, referring to Q Developer's growth. ""AWS has fallen behind in the AI race.""

An Amazon spokesperson wrote in an email that it is ""continuing to innovate rapidly"" to grow Q, with firms including ADP, Deloitte, and Japan Research Institute among active users.

""We're extremely pleased with the accelerating growth of Amazon Q, where daily usage of Q Developer has increased 9-fold per person this year,"" the spokesperson added.

Q is a key AI product category for Amazon, akin to Microsoft's Copilot. Q Developer is a AI coding assistant for developers, while Q Business is an AI chatbot targeting general business users.

But Q has yet to gain widespread recognition, and Amazon is now looking to refine the Q branding, according to several Amazon employees who spoke to BI. These people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.

Q Business is also undergoing a major revamp with the forthcoming Quick Suite, BI previously reported.

Several Amazon employees told BI that AWS lacks a strong reputation for AI-powered developer tools. They said generative AI took AWS by surprise, leading the company to rush new products without comprehensive feature sets.

Amazon's spokesperson told BI that Q Developer continues to receive positive feedback from customers, and it is the most widely used internal tool at the company.

""We are seeing more and more customers, from startups to large enterprises, adopt Q Developer to make their teams more productive,"" the spokesperson said.

For Amazon, the AI coding market is too big to walk away from. Gartner projects that by 2028, 40% of new business software will be built with such tools.

Yet even inside Amazon, employees appear to favor external products like Cursor over Q Developer.

Internal Slack messages reviewed by BI earlier this year showed that Amazon was planning to deploy Cursor internally after strong employee demand. In one message, an employee wrote that Cursor can make ""almost instantaneous"" changes, while Q Developer takes ""minutes.""

Even Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has taken note. He previously said Q Developer saved Amazon ""4,500 developer years of work"" and an estimated $260 million in ""annualized efficiency gains."" On May's earnings call, however, he pointed to Cursor, an AWS cloud customer, as a major force behind the ""explosion of coding agents.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","This Chinese EV has gullwing doors and a light show. I drove it to see if it's a Tesla rival.","https://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-ev-test-drive-hyptec-ht-suv-gullwing-telsa-byd-2025-9","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 00:14:00 GMT","

The Hyptec HT is hard to miss, especially the one I tested in a bright shade of orange.

Over three days behind the wheel in Singapore, the car drew plenty of attention. People stopped to ask what it was, and a few even asked to snap a photo.

Like many new Chinese EVs, the Hyptec HT isn't available in the US. It's made by Guangzhou Automobile Group, or GAC, one of China's largest carmakers.

Hyptec, short for ""hyper"" and ""technology,"" is part of GAC's Aion brand and represents its bid to tap the booming premium EV market. With the HT, that push is aimed squarely at Tesla's Model Y and BYD's Sealion 7.

The company makes no secret of who it's going up against.

""We are targeting Sealion 7 and Model Y customers, and not creating a new market niche,"" Bender Guo, GAC's country manager for Singapore and Vietnam, told Business Insider.

The HT's silhouette struck me as very similar to Tesla's Model Y. Interestingly, it was designed at GAC's Advanced Design Studio in Los Angeles, just 15 miles from Tesla's design hub in Hawthorne — though there's no evidence the proximity influenced the design.

The HT wears sharp character lines, a coupe-like roofline, and flush door handles, giving it a futuristic look that blends sporty and premium.

One of the Hyptec HT's boldest design choices is its gullwing rear doors, a touch of ""Back to the Future"" made modern. Hyptec says they need a little over a foot of clearance, with 12 radar sensors to stop them clipping walls or ceilings.

They felt seamless in use: Press a button, and the doors glide up, making entry and exit easier than expected.

Still, the doors aren't perfect. Testing the car with two young kids in tow, they didn't feel entirely safe. At one point, a closing door required us to move a child's head out of the way — the sensors didn't seem ready to intervene. That said, there is the option for a standard door. The car is also available in less attention-grabbing colors.

For drivers interested in turning more heads, the HT features a choreographed audio-visual ""light show"" for onlookers — a party trick Tesla fans will recognize.

When I stepped in, the HT felt spacious and comfortable. The cabin leaned into luxury with orange Napa leather and an impressive finish front and back. Large windows and a skylight built into the gullwing doors filled the space with light. With its 2,935 mm wheelbase — the longest in its class — the back seat felt roomy enough for three adults, though taller passengers may want to avoid the middle seat, where the ceiling dips a bit lower.

Rear passengers also get a few indulgences I tested myself: seatbacks that recline to 143 degrees, a fold-out footrest on the left, and a tray table on the right that wouldn't look out of place in a Rolls-Royce.

Up front, I tried the ventilated seats and the 10-point massage system, which offers five modes. I could even choose which part of my back deserved a little extra love.

As expected these days, everything is controlled through a central screen. The car has a 14.6-inch display that handles climate, driving modes, and safety systems. It looks sleek, but adjusting basics like air conditioning required digging into menus. I also found disabling the safety assistance both difficult and annoying.

The cockpit itself was a pleasant place. The steering wheel reminded me of an Aston Martin DBX, and visibility was good all around. Seat comfort was excellent too, making it a car I felt I could drive for hours without fatigue. There was also plenty of storage space.

That said, a couple of details could use fine-tuning. The central air vent never seemed to hit the right angle, and the wireless phone charger was inconsistent, often cutting off mid-charge. I ended up plugging in a cable instead.

Out on the highway, the HT was impressively smooth and quiet. Even at three-figure speeds, wind and road noise are barely noticeable, leaving the cabin cocoon-like. GAC claims a WLTP range of 323 miles, which should be more than enough to get from Los Angeles to Las Vegas on a single charge.

It's a large car, so testing it like a performance sedan didn't make sense. Even so, it was very quick, especially in sport mode, as most EVs are. When a bend tightened more than expected, the HT stayed composed, with the steering delivering a reassuringly precise response.

In China, the top-spec Hyptec HT is priced at 285,900 yuan, or $40,100, slightly above the Tesla Model Y's 263,500 yuan price tag. That puts it squarely in premium-EV territory, but it has the features to back it up — especially those gullwing doors and limousine-like rear seats.

The car was first released in China in 2023 and later launched in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Thailand. GAC is set to expand into Europe next.

With a Brazilian factory slated to open in 2026, the company is signaling its intent to be a frontrunner in the global EV race.

In this article

DETROIT — Honda Motor is ending U.S. production of its Acura ZDX electric crossover that was being produced by General Motors in Tennessee, CNBC has learned.

Production of the vehicle for the 2026 model year was slated to begin this month at GM's Spring Hill Assembly plant in Tennessee, however Honda ""has decided to cancel all future production,"" according to a message Tuesday to plant workers that was seen by CNBC.

A Honda spokeswoman confirmed the plans Wednesday, citing market conditions for EVs. Another Honda-branded EV called the Prologue that's being assembled by GM will continue production in Mexico, she said.  

""To better align our product portfolio with the needs of our customers and market conditions, as well as our long-term strategic goals, we can confirm the Acura ZDX has ended production,"" she said in an emailed statement. ""ZDX has played a valuable role for the Acura brand, and will provide a foundation we will build on next year with the arrival of the all-electric Acura RSX, which will be produced at the EV Hub in Ohio in the second half of 2026, as well as with hybrid-electric Acura models now in development.""

Honda has sold roughly 19,000 ZDX models since the vehicle was released last year in the U.S., including more than 11,000 of the vehicles through August of this year.

GM declined to comment on the vehicle, which was part of the company's plans to assist in scaling its EV production and technologies.

The message to plant workers also said the companies are aligning EV production to better match slower demand for electric cars, saying that was the reasoning for the shift rather than anything to do with the relationship between the companies or the quality of products.

""We have a strong relationship with Honda that we've built over many years and we look forward to working with Honda on future opportunities,"" the message said. ""Honda's decision isn't a reflection on the capabilities of the Spring Hill workforce or GM's commitment to Spring Hill.""

The message also said the vehicle shift does not change GM's employment plans for the facility. It's aiming to add more engine production as well as the gas-powered Chevrolet Blazer starting in 2027.

A gunman opened fire at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Dallas on Wednesday morning, shooting multiple people and killing one before taking his own life, authorities said.

""We had four individuals that were shot, two of them deceased, including the shooter,"" Dallas Police Chief Daniel Comeaux said at a news conference.

Federal authorities said that the victims include ICE detainees.

No law enforcement members were hurt during the attack, said Joe Rothrock, special agent in charge of the Dallas FBI field office, at the conference.

Rothrock said that rounds of ammunition found near the suspected shooter ""contain messages that are anti-ICE in nature.""

FBI Director Kash Patel later wrote on X that an ""initial review of the evidence shows an [ideological] motive behind this attack.""

""One of the unspent shell casings recovered was engraved with the phrase 'ANTI ICE.' More updates will be forthcoming,"" Patel wrote in the post, which included a photo of the casings.

The attack is being investigated as ""an act of targeted violence,"" Rothrock said at the presser. 

Rothrock said the shooting was just the latest example of violence targeting ICE in Texas, noting that there was a ""coordinated attack"" on an immigrant detention center in the state on July 4.

Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson thanked law enforcement who responded to the shooting, and called for people to come together in prayer for the nation.

""There's a lot going on right now in our country, a lot that's confusing,"" he said. ""Please pray for everyone who's affected by today's tragedy.""

Johnson, a Republican, called for patience while the active investigation into the shooting continues.

Multiple senior Trump administration officials quickly drew a link between the attack and what they characterized as extreme left-wing rhetoric against ICE. The agency has become a flashpoint of controversy during President Donald Trump's second term, as it carries out unprecedented operations to remove millions of undocumented immigrants from the U.S.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X later Wednesday, ""These horrendous killings must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences.""

Vice President JD Vance posted, ""The obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.""

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote, ""Democrats must stop demonizing the heroic men and women of ICE who are just doing their jobs to keep Americans safe.""

In this article

Lithium Americas stock doubled Wednesday as the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the mining company, which is based in Vancouver, British Columbia.

The White House proposed the equity stake as Lithium Americas renegotiates the terms of a $2.2 billion loan from the Department of Energy for its Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, a Trump administration official told CNBC. Reuters first reported the equity stake proposal.

Lithium Americas' shares hit a session high of $6.23, up more than 100% over Tuesday's close of $3.07. The miner has a market cap of about $1.5 billion.

It is the latest move by the White House to take direct ownership in the mineral supply chain critical to U.S. interests, but the first such stake proposed for a Canadian company. Lithium Americas trades on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NYSE but is incorporated and domiciled in Canada.

The Department of Defense took a 15% equity stake in rare earth miner MP Materials in July. Shares of Las Vegas-based MP Materials have more than doubled since the deal.

Thacker Pass in northern Nevada is expected to become one of the largest sources of lithium in North America with the first phase of the project scheduled to start operations in late 2027. The project is a joint venture between Lithium Americas and General Motors.

Lithium Americas has a 62% stake and operates the mine. GM has a 38% stake and has agreed to buy offtake from the mine when it is operational. Lithium is a critical material for electric vehicle batteries.

Lithium Americas and GM had to renegotiate the terms of the loan for Thacker Pass because they did not meet the conditions for the first disbursement, the Trump administration official said. During negotiations with the Department of Energy, they requested to push out part of the loan repayment into later years, the official said.

""If we're going to push out part of the repayment into later years, then the administration would like a very small stake of equity to create essentially a cash buffer and eliminate some risk on behalf of taxpayers,"" the official said.

A deal has not been finalized but the Trump administration supports the project and the discussions are positive, the official said. The investment could need Canadian approval as well given the company's jurisdiction.

Lithium Americas confirmed Wednesday that it is in talks with the Energy Department and GM on the loan for Thacker Pass. GM declined CNBC's request for comment.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum revealed in April that the Trump administration was considering taking equity stakes in miners to back them against state-sponsored competition in China.

For humans to pass the prestigious, three-part chartered financial analyst exam, it typically takes around 1,000 hours of studying over the course of several years. New research found that the technology underpinning a slew of artificial intelligence models is now advanced enough to pass even the most difficult – Level III – mock exams in a matter of minutes.

The new study – developed by researchers from New York University Stern School of Business and GoodFin, an AI-powered wealth management platform – evaluated 23 large language models on their ability to answer multiple choice and essay questions on mock CFA Level III exams. They found frontier reasoning models, including o4-mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude Opus, were able to use ""chain-of-thought prompting"" to successfully pass.

Previous research, particularly from two years ago, had found artificial intelligence could clear Levels I and II of the exam, but it struggled with Level III, due to the essay questions. However, the technology has evolved so rapidly that the researchers wanted to know whether the models could handle, ""specialized, high-stakes analytical reasoning required for professional financial decision-making."" The third CFA exam is primarily focused on portfolio management and wealth planning.

""I think there's absolutely a future where this technology transforms the industry,"" said Anna Joo Fee, founder and CEO of GoodFin, which contributed to – but did not pay for – the research.

Still, Fee said she does not think the AI will ultimately replace the CFA.

""There are things like context and intent that are hard for the machine to assess right now,"" Fee said. ""That's where a human shines, in understanding your body language and cues.""

MUNICH — Xiaomi on Wednesday made the international debut of a slew of new devices and appliances with its smartphones at the center, as the Chinese tech giant sets out to directly challenge Samsung.

The Beijing-headquartered company took the wraps off of the Xiaomi 15T series comprising of two smartphones — the Xiaomi 15T and Xiaomi 15T Pro — during a launch event in Munich.

The devices, priced at 649 euros ($766) and 799 euros, respectively, continue Xiaomi's strategy of bringing phones with the latest specs to the market at a competitive price.

Xiaomi talked up the triple-camera system, large 6.83-inch display and big battery power, as it looks to position the devices as a potential contender to Samsung's mid-range A series and top-end S Series of smartphones.

For comparison, Samsung's S25 starts at 799 euros, while its top-end device, the S25 Ultra, starts at 1,249 euros in Germany.

""The 15T is basically an affordable flagship with high-end features but priced half a notch down from the top tier premium devices,"" Bryan Ma, vice president of devices research at International Data Corporation, told CNBC by email.

Over the past few years, Xiaomi has expanded its geographical footprint and offerings to include everything from washing machines to electric cars.

In Europe, Xiaomi has cemented itself as the third largest smartphone player by market share, behind Samsung and Apple, through a mix of high-end and mid-tier devices that have offered a stiff challenge to the two giants.

Xiaomi launched its more expensive Xiaomi 15 phones internationally earlier this year. In China, it is gearing up for the unveiling of its 17 series of devices, which will be its flagship.

""Xiaomi 15T is another important step for Xiaomi in its premiumization strategy, particularly trying to capture the slightly more budget-sensitive, spec-focused buyers that still opt for a high-end device, Runar Bjorhovde, analyst at Canalys said.

""One of Xiaomi's major strategic focuses in taking on the high-end.""

But the company has bigger ambitions. On Wednesday, Xiaomi announced the global launch of it Mijia brand of  home appliances, which include a refrigerator, washing machine and air conditioner.

It's a move right out of Samsung's playbook. The South Korean technology giant sells products across the world spanning from appliances to smartphones and TVs.

""Xiaomi naturally puts the pressure on any competitor in the sectors that it enters given its operating model of aggressively priced yet good quality products,"" Ma said.

Global defense stocks moved higher on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump, in a major rhetorical shift, said Ukraine could retake territory currently occupied by Russia.

In a post published overnight on his Truth Social platform, Trump said that Kyiv, with the support of the European Union and the NATO military coalition, ""is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.""

The EU and NATO have offered military and humanitarian support to Ukraine — which is not currently a member of either organization — since the start of Russia's invasion in 2022.

Trump said his view came after ""getting to know and fully understand"" Russia and Ukraine's military and economic situation, noting what he described as the ""economic trouble"" that the conflict is causing in Moscow. The White House leader also likened Russia to a ""paper tiger"" — a term that typically refers to a force that appears powerful, but is in truth ineffective.

The U.S. president has previously suggested Ukraine would need to be open to giving up some of its territory in peace talks, which Washington has taken steps to broker since the start of Trump's second mandate.

In separate comments on Tuesday, Trump said NATO members should shoot down Russian jets entering its airspace, following a series of reported incursions in the Polish, Romanian and Estonian skies by Russian aircraft and drones in recent weeks.

Defense stocks were among the top performers on the pan-European Stoxx 600 index on Wednesday afternoon.

German tank parts maker Renk was last seen trading around 6.5% higher, while Italian defense firm Leonardo and Swedish defense giant Saab both rose more than 3.5%.

German defense firm Hensoldt was another top performer, up 5.8% at 3:30 p.m. London time.

Hensoldt Chief Financial Officer Christian Ladurner said Trump's comments don't necessarily change the overall situation for Europe's defense industry, but that they rather reaffirm the sector's warnings that Russian President Vladmir Putin will continue to test the bloc.

""I think, in general, we have to say that the developments we have seen in the last two days are very encouraging for Europe,"" Ladurner told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Wednesday.

""We see that the U.S. is more and more, I would say, seeing the reality, what is really happening and what has happened. So, this is encouraging for us,"" he added.

In Asia, major South Korean defense stocks — including Hanwha Aerospace, Korea Aerospace and Hyundai Rotem — all posted gains of between 2% and 5% on Wednesday.

Stateside, U.S. defense stocks were also higher. Lockheed Martin, RTX and Northrop Grumman all traded more than 1% higher, while Boeing was up around 0.3%.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed Trump's Truth Social post, saying on social media that he was ""grateful"" for the U.S. president's ""strong cooperation.""

Trump ""clearly understands the situation and is well-informed about all aspects of this war. We highly value his resolve to help end this war,"" Zelenskyy said on social media platform X on Tuesday evening.

Russia — which has improved rapprochement with Washington in recent months — also responded to Trump's tonal shift on the Ukraine war.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday said Putin ""highly values Trump's willingness to help"" find solutions on Ukraine. Peskov disputed Trump's labelling of Russia as a so-called ""paper tiger,"" however.

				Taken from CNBC's Daily Open, our international markets newsletter — Subscribe today


Talk about bad timing. OpenAI's first Stargate development to come online — a data center in Texas that's stuffed to the brims with Oracle and Nvidia infrastructure — did so just as investors started questioning the sustainability of the artificial intelligence firm's trajectory.

Shares of Nvidia and Oracle, the major players in OpenAI's push to establish data centers that are essentially the heart of ChatGPT, fell Tuesday. Their moves were all the starker when compared with their spikes on the previous day, when Nvidia and OpenAI jointly announced their $100 billion partnership.

Some questions that investors appeared to be asking: Where's all that power needed to keep the data centers running — approximately the output of 17 nuclear plants — going to come from? Is Nvidia's investment in OpenAI — which essentially gives the company money to buy its chips — uncannily similar to what happened during the 2000s Dotcom bubble?

Adding to those concerns was U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's statement that ""by many measures, for example, equity prices are fairly highly valued."" Additionally, Powell raised concerns that there could be signs of stagflation — persistent inflation amid a flagging labor market — in the U.S. economy.

That combination of events might make OpenAI CEO Sam Altman feel like the bride getting outshone on her wedding day. Or maybe not. Altman acknowledged that ""people are worried"" — ""but this is what it takes."" Besides, that bride still has many suitors, waving billion-dollar checks at her.

Slowing U.S. employment led to rate cut. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made those comments on Tuesday, when he warned about the growing ""two-sided risks"" of inflation and unemployment. He added that stock prices look ""fairly highly valued.""

OpenAI opens first Stargate data center. It's located in Abilene, Texas, and is powered by Oracle Cloud infrastructure and Nvidia chips. OpenAI finance chief Sarah Friar said the company will bring in $13 billion in revenue this year.

Alibaba to invest more in artificial intelligence. The total amount will be more than the 380 billion yuan ($53 billion) over three years previously announced, CEO Eddie Wu said Wednesday. Hong Kong-listed shares of Alibaba jumped to their highest since 2021.

U.S. tech stocks pull back. That caused the S&P 500 to close 0.55% lower Tuesday, after touching an intraday high in the session. Asia-Pacific markets were mixed Wednesday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose on the back of Alibaba's jump.

[PRO] Monumental needs for a 'monumental' deal. Nvidia's $100 billion investment in OpenAI will require the power consumption of 8 million U.S. households, according to a CNBC calculation. Finding that energy could be difficult.

Japan shares keep breaking records as reforms, foreign inflows outweigh political risks

Japanese equities are extending record highs, fueled by steady inflows from foreign investors and governance reforms.

The country is finally exiting its ""lost decades"" of deflation, said Kei Okamura, Neuberger Berman's MD and Japanese equities portfolio manager. Real wages and household consumption have eked out a fragile recovery, while inflation is stabilizing around the Bank of Japan's 2% target, and the yen has largely steadied after last year's plunge to 160 per dollar.

Monday - Friday, 10:00 - 11:00 SIN/HK  |  0400 - 05:00 CET

This report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. You can subscribe here.

Many in business circles were hoping for a sweeping U.S.-China trade deal, but an agreement now looks even more elusive.

The fate of TikTok in the U.S. overshadowed the latest round of trade talks, to the point that it's now unclear whether both sides are on the same page about what the app's divestiture from Beijing-based parent ByteDance should look like.

Meanwhile, on issues like tariffs, fentanyl and semiconductors, even less has been said by either side.

The distance is already visible. China has been silent on future meetings, even as U.S. President Donald Trump announced he and Chinese President Xi Jinping ""agreed"" to meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea next month.

The lack of details in the Chinese side's statement ""suggests that China is taking time to negotiate when U.S. is keen to have deals,"" said Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU School of Law, pointing out that Beijing ""said nothing about [an] APEC meeting.""

And then there's China's vague commitments to a tech licensing deal to keep TikTok alive in the U.S. — what Beijing calls a ""solution that complies with China's laws and regulations.""

That contrasts with the constant flow of details from the U.S., now covering everything from investors to board seats. A Politico report, citing an unnamed senior White House official, even claimed that the Trump administration is ""100% confident"" of a deal forcing Beijing-based ByteDance to spin off TikTok's U.S. operations.

Trump, however, may have preempted China's coolness, saying in a Truth Social post Friday that he ""appreciate[s] the TikTok approval"" after his call with Xi, even as Beijing kept its language vague.

China, meanwhile, has paired that coolness with a media blitz around its latest talks with the U.S. in Madrid, aiming to project confidence as a tech power following a showcase of new weapons at the Sept. 3 military parade.

Context is everything

In the runup to the Madrid talks held earlier this month, Beijing announced new probes into U.S. chips — and, as the negotiations wrapped up on Monday, called out Nvidia for alleged monopolistic practices. The next evening, the official evening news broadcast — closely watched by officials and anyone trying to read the tea leaves on Beijing — included a segment highlighting China's own semiconductors.

A day before the Trump-Xi call, Chinese tech giant Huawei also claimed its upcoming chip cluster would be more powerful than Nvidia's.

All these news items may appear to be separate events. But in China, where ceremonial timing matters, little happens in a vacuum — any action from a parade to chosen silence is calculated, often tapping into a political context that may appear unrelated to outsiders.

Notably, the latest debate over TikTok coincided with China's national cybersecurity week, held on Sept 15-21. In past years, the event has served as a platform for Beijing to promote its national security agenda.

""Honestly, I really don't see why the Chinese side would have any interest at all in divesting the ... U.S. TikTok,"" said Blueshirt Group Managing Director Gary Dvorchak, whose work on Chinese listings in the U.S. has taken him between both countries.

""What's their gain from it? They're losing control of one of the crown jewels of China's technology,"" he said, pointing out that the U.S. would disagree if China wanted America to sell part of Google or Facebook. ""So why would they do something that we would never do?""

Despite the standoff over TikTok, China hosted a bipartisan delegation of U.S. House Representatives this week, who arrived the weekend after the latest Trump-Xi phone call. It was the first such visit since 2019.

U.S. representative Adam Smith, who led the trip, told reporters Tuesday that in meetings with Chinese leaders, the two sides discussed TikTok as an issue to be resolved, but did not get into technical details.

""I think there's going to be a lot of maybe positive noises"" about TikTok, Dvorchak said, ""but then in the end, at the last minute, it's always going to fall apart.""

That said, the TikTok battle has become part of a larger game of political theatre. Beijing never confirmed Trump's announcement early last week that he would speak with Xi — until state media announced on Friday that the two leaders were speaking.

But the more elaborate the posturing by both sides, the more difficult it is to achieve a deal with optics that satisfies both sides.

Bill Bishop of Sinocism compared the new U.S. H-1B visa rules with China's K-Visa and the implications for the two countries.

Shen Jianguang, Vice President & Chief Economist at Chinese tech giant JD.Com, evaluated China's position in global trade as the economy remains sluggish.

Ahead of the Trump-Xi phone call, Duncan Clark, Chairman of BDA China and author of ""Alibaba: The House that Jack Ma Built"", suggested that the U.S. cannot afford to overplay its hand as China currently has the advantage.

Apple iPhone 17 sees demand rise. The U.S. smartphone giant could be poised for a comeback, as a few buyers in Beijing told CNBC that more locals are giving the iPhone a try this year due to its upgraded features. But the highly anticipated iPhone Air isn't coming to China yet due to its eSIM design.

Chinese nationals hit with fresh U.S. visa uncertainty. After the Trump administration said that it would ask companies to pay $100,000 for new H-1B visa applicants, many Chinese shared their frustration on social media. China was the second-largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 11.7% of approved visa holders, according to U.S. homeland security data.

ByteDance valuation hopes climb. Investor conviction in the Chinese tech giant has climbed since Washington and Beijing this week reached a framework agreement on the long-contested future of TikTok in the U.S., several dealmakers told CNBC. The latest valuation? $400 billion.

Investors are realizing, 'I was told China is uninvestable, and Alibaba has gone up 100%. It's one of the biggest companies in the world. Maybe I should be looking back at that.'

— Mark Tinker, CIO of Toscafund Hong Kong

Mainland China and Hong Kong stocks were higher, bucking overall declines in Asia after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that ""equity prices are fairly highly valued.""

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and mainland China's CSI 300 were up 1% and 0.88% respectively. Super Typhoon Ragasa brought hurricane-force winds to high grounds and southern areas in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory noted. Conditions remain severe, with heavy showers and thunderstorms expected.

Shares of Alibaba listed in Hong Kong jumped over 6% after CEO Eddie Wu said Wednesday that the company will boost its investment in artificial intelligence.

ABILENE, Texas — Sam Altman stood on a patch of hot Texas dirt, the kind that turns to dust storms on dry days and mud slicks after a sudden rain. Behind him stretched the outlines of what will soon be a massive data center complex in the west-central part of the state, where heavy wind often meets extreme heat.

It was a fitting backdrop for the OpenAI CEO to unveil what he calls the largest infrastructure push of the modern internet era: a 17-gigawatt buildout in partnership with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank.

In less than 48 hours, OpenAI has announced commitments equal to 17 nuclear plants or about nine Hoover Dams. The plan will require the amount of electricity needed to power more than 13 million U.S. homes.

The scale is staggering, even for a company that's raised a record amount of private market cash and seen its valuation swell to $500 billion. At roughly $50 billion per site, OpenAI's projects add up to about $850 billion in spending, nearly half of the $2 trillion global AI infrastructure surge HSBC now forecasts.

Altman understands the concern. But he rejects the idea that the spending spree is overkill.

""People are worried. I totally get that. I think that's a very natural thing,"" Altman told CNBC on Tuesday from the site of the first of its mega data centers in Abilene. ""We are growing faster than any business I've ever heard of before.""

Altman insisted that the building boom is in response to soaring demand, highlighting the tenfold jump in ChatGPT usage over the past 18 months. He said a network of supercomputing facilities is what's required to maximize the capabilities of AI.

""This is what it takes to deliver AI,"" Altman said. ""Unlike previous technological revolutions or previous versions of the internet, there's so much infrastructure that's required, and this is a small sample of it.""

The biggest bottleneck for AI isn't money or chips — it's electricity. Altman has put money into nuclear companies because he sees their steady, concentrated output as one of the only energy sources strong enough to meet AI's enormous demand.

Altman led a $500 million funding round into fusion firm Helion Energy to build a demonstration reactor, and backed Oklo, a fission company he took public last year through his own SPAC. 

Critics warn of a bubble, pointing to how companies like Nvidia, Oracle, Broadcom and Microsoft have each added hundreds of billions of dollars in market value on the back of tie-ups with OpenAI, which is burning cash. Nvidia and Microsoft are now worth a combined $8.1 trillion, or equal to about 13.5% of the S&P 500.

Skeptics also say the system looks like a circular financing model. OpenAI is committing hundreds of billions of dollars to projects that rely on partners like Nvidia, Oracle, and SoftBank. Those companies are simultaneously investing in the same projects and then getting paid back through chip sales and data center leases.

Friar has a different perspective, arguing that the entire ecosystem is banding together to meet a historic surge in compute needs. Big tech booms, Friar noted, have always required this kind of bold, coordinated infrastructure buildout.

Altman added that such cycles of overinvesting and underinvesting have marked every past technological revolution. Some people, he said, will surely feel the pain.

""People will get burned on overinvesting and people also get burned on underinvesting and not having enough capacity,"" he said. ""Smart people will get overexcited, and people will lose a lot of money. People will make a lot of money. But I am confident that long term, the value of this technology is going to be gigantic to society.""

OpenAI's partners are betting big on that future. Oracle is even reshaping its leadership around it. On Monday, the company promoted Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia to CEO roles, replacing Safra Catz. Magouyrk ran cloud infrastructure and Sicilia was president of Oracle Industries.

""When you think about why make a transition now, it's really around Oracle's being set up for success,"" Magouyrk told CNBC. ""I only see more and more demand from the end users … what looks like near infinite demand for technology.""

Nvidia is fronting equity alongside its chips, including the new Vera Rubin accelerators meant to power the next wave of AI workloads. The Abilene facility is being leased by Oracle.

""Folks like Oracle are putting their balance sheets to work to create these incredible data centers you see behind us,"" OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar said in an interview on site.

She explained that OpenAI will pay operating expenses for the data centers when they're online, while Nvidia's investments are getting the project up and running.

""But importantly, they will get paid for all those chips as those chips get deployed,"" Friar said, referring to the arrangement with Nvidia.

Friar, who previously helped take Block public as CFO and then guided Nextdoor to the public market as CEO, pointed to the balancing act between equity, debt and operating expenses. She said that the facilities breaking ground now are aimed at bringing new capacity online next year.

""But then it's about what gets built for 2027, 2028, and 2029,"" she said. ""What we see today is a massive compute crunch. There's not enough compute to do all the things that AI can do, and so we need to get it started — and we need to do it as a full ecosystem.""

As for OpenAI's long-term relationship with Microsoft, ""They're a major partner,"" Friar said, adding that the company will continue to be a key supplier of compute capacity.

She hinted that more developments are on the way with Microsoft, and that she's ""pleased that we are where we are, but not fully ready to announce everything yet.""

In Friar's current role, the numbers are much bigger than they ever were at the two companies she took public. Eventually OpenAI investors will expect returns on their hefty investments, but Altman said that the question of an IPO is ""complicated.""

""I assume that someday we will be a public company,"" he told CNBC. ""I have mixed feelings about it … for now, we're certainly able to raise a lot of capital in private markets.""

He said that being public could make long-term investments harder, given the need to meet Wall Street's expectations on a quarterly basis. But it would open up access to a broader base of investors, he said.

""I think that the world should, if people want to, own shares in OpenAI. I think that's awesome, and I want that to happen,"" Altman said.

In the near term, the story is about many billions of dollars plowed into chips and data centers in places like Abilene, and eventually in New Mexico, Ohio and elsewhere.

But OpenAI isn't just about infrastructure. In May, the company made the stunning announcement that it had acquired Jony Ive's nascent devices startup for about $6.4 billion. Bringing in the designer of the iPhone and the rest of Apple's most popular products wasn't an accident.

While in Texas, Altman hinted at hardware that could reshape how people use computers in their everyday lives.

The OpenAI CEO said computers have never before been able to truly ""understand and think,"" and that breakthrough creates the chance to invent an entirely new way of using them.

He cautioned that it will take time before OpenAI has anything ready to ship. Even when it gets there, the company plans to release only a ""small family of devices,"" he said. But the potential, Altman said, is ""something big"" and worth pursuing.

European shares ended the day slightly lower on Wednesday, although defense stocks received a boost from U.S. President Donald Trump's latest comments on the conflict in Ukraine.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 provisionally ended the day down 0.14%, paring some losses from earlier in the session.

Defense stocks were among the top performers, with the Stoxx Europe Aerospace and Defense Index gaining around 1.3%.

Germany's Renk and Hensoldt both added around 8%, and Sweden's Saab gained almost 5.5%.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said Ukraine could recoup all of its territory from Russia in a major shift in stance.

""I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form,"" the president said in a post on his Truth Social platform.

""With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option,"" he added.

Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Tuesday, when he also expressed support for NATO members shooting down any Russian aircraft that breaches their airspace.

It comes after global markets were rattled by comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday. 

He said asset prices, including equities, were trading at inflated levels.

""By many measures, for example, equity prices are fairly highly valued,"" he said, when asked about the central bank's tolerance levels for market prices.

Overnight in Asia, shares broadly moved lower, while U.S. stocks were mixed.

Alibaba shares soared in Hong Kong and U.S. premarket trading on Wednesday after the company said it will invest more in artificial intelligence and rolled out new AI products and updates. 

The tech giant's Hong Kong-listed shares jumped over 6%, to reach their highest point since 2021. Total gains over the year-to-date topped 107%. 

In the U.S., shares were 9.3% higher in premarket trade at 4.21 a.m. ET. 

Alibaba plans to increase spending on AI models and infrastructure development, on top of the 380 billion yuan ($53 billion) over three years it announced in February, Chief Executive Officer Eddie Wu said Wednesday at Alibaba Cloud's annual flagship technology conference.

""We are vigorously advancing a three-year, 380 billion [yuan] AI infrastructure initiative with plans to sustain and further increase our investment according to our strategic vision in anticipation of the [artificial superintelligence] era,"" Wu said. 

So-called ""artificial superintelligence"" refers to AI that would hypothetically surpass the power and intelligence of the human brain, with the hypothetical benchmark becoming a growing focus of major AI companies. 

Alibaba also officially unveiled the latest version of its Qwen large language models — the Qwen3-Max — on Wednesday, along with a series of other updates to its suite of AI product offerings. 

Wu highlighted that Alibaba Cloud is strategically positioned as a ""full-stack AI service provider,"" delivering the computing power required for training and deploying large AI models on the cloud through its own data centers.

""The cumulative investment in global AI in the next five years will exceed $4 trillion, and this is the largest investment in computing power and research and development in history,"" he added.

Alibaba Cloud will also launch its first data centres in Brazil, France, and the Netherlands, the company said at the conference, and add more data centres in Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Dubai next year.

Last month, the company secured a deal with Unicom, a Chinese e-commerce giant, which will deploy Alibaba's AI accelerators from its semiconductor unit. Chinese tech firms have been focusing on securing chip self-sufficiency as tensions grow between the U.S. and China.

It's been a chaotic few days for the tech sector, and industry executives and experts are still assessing how U.S. President Donald Trump's latest immigration crackdown could shape the future of their workforces. 

The Trump administration sparked widespread panic Friday after announcing employers will pay a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas, which are temporary work visas granted to highly skilled foreign professionals. These visas have underpinned the U.S. tech workforce for decades.

Some tech executives, including Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have lauded the changes to the H-1B program, but experts told CNBC that the Trump administration's changes could prevent some tech companies — namely startups — from securing top foreign talent. These experts said the changes also run the risk of driving top talent toward other countries.

""The short of it is, it would be a disaster for America, for American companies, American competitiveness, American innovation,"" said Exequiel Hernandez, an associate professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

The current annual cap for H-1B visas is at 65,000, along with 20,000 additional visas for foreign professionals with advanced degrees.

In fiscal 2025, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Google are among the top 10 companies that employ the most H-1B holders. Prominent tech executives like Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla CEO Elon Musk were H-1B recipients earlier in their careers.

As tech companies scrambled to respond before Trump's proclamation went into effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on Sunday, the White House quelled some concerns on Saturday by clarifying that the fee is not annual and would only apply to new visas, not renewals for current visa holders.

More changes could be on the horizon. 

The Trump administration teased a proposed rule on Tuesday that said H-1B recipients should be selected through a weighted process instead of a random one. The weighted process would take place when the number of requests for visas exceeds the limit of available spots, and it would be based on wage levels, the proposal said.

The proposed rule will officially publish in the Federal Register on Wednesday, and it's still subject to change after the administration reviews initial public feedback.

Hastings called the Trump administration's $100,000 fee a ""great solution,"" in a post on X on Sunday.

""It will mean H1-B is used just for very high value jobs, which will mean no lottery needed, and more certainty for those jobs,"" he wrote.

OpenAI's Altman expressed support for the updates during an interview with CNBC's Jon Fortt on Monday.

""We need to get the smartest people in the country, and streamlining that process and also sort of outlining financial incentives seems good to me,"" Altman said.

Historically, H-1B visas have cost employers somewhere between $2,000 to $5,000 per application, depending on the size of the company, according to the Immigration Law Group. 

The new $100,000 fee is a big jump for small, cash-strapped startups.

""You're not going to find many startups who are going to be willing to pay $100,000 per H-1B, in addition to salary for that H-1B,"" said Adam Kovacevich, CEO of Chamber of Progress, a left-leaning tech industry trade association.

Even big tech companies could feel some pain and have to reassess who they use H-1Bs for. But their deep pockets come with advantages. 

""A big firm like Microsoft or Google, even though it's not ideal for them, they have workarounds,"" said Wharton's Hernandez. ""They can offshore jobs, or they're the ones who can make acquisitions.""

Garry Tan, the CEO of the popular startup accelerator Y Combinator, criticized the Trump administration's new fee, writing in a LinkedIn post that ""it kneecaps startups"" and is a ""massive gift"" to overseas tech hubs.

""In the middle of an AI arms race, we're telling builders to build elsewhere,"" Tan wrote. ""We need American Little Tech to win—not $100K toll booths.""

U.S. tech companies big and small are fiercely competing with one another – and the rest of the world – as they race to develop the most advanced AI models and applications. Organizations like Meta have shelled out billions of dollars to recruit top AI talent in an effort to try and gain an edge.  

The Trump administration's changes to the H-1B program could complicate similar recruiting efforts. 

""What this does is that it gives our competitors, other countries, places like Asia, Canada, Europe, they can then attract these employees to create new innovations,"" said Steven Hubbard, a data scientist at the American Immigration Council, which is a nonprofit for immigration advocacy and research. 

One big competitor in the war for talent is China. The world's second-largest economy has long fought against the U.S. for tech dominance, and more recently the AI race.

Earlier this year, Chinese AI firm DeepSeek rattled global markets after claiming to create a large language chatbot that outperformed competitors at a fraction of the cost. The news raised questions over the significant sums that American tech companies are shelling out on AI.

Some experts worry that visa changes could deal a victory into China's hands, sending top talent overseas. The move may also deter foreign students from attending university in the U.S. as uncertainty hangs over their post-graduation job prospects.

""Those students are going to look at this environment and stay home,"" said Greg Morrisett, vice provost at Cornell Tech. ""It's giving a leg up to both China and India in terms of feeding their startup ecosystems.""

For Bradley Tusk, the CEO of Tusk Venture Partners, the changes to the H-1B program are simply ""terrible."" American companies have to have access to top talent in order to compete at the highest levels, he said.  

""America's competitive advantage has always been the ability to attract the best talent from around the world,"" Tusk said. ""To limit our ability to recruit and compete is illogical.""

Labubu dolls have emerged as a must-have accessory in luxury fashion, with celebrities like Blackpink's Lisa pairing the toys with Louis Vuitton and Hermès bags.

The coveted blind box toys — collectible plushes that look like a rabbit-esque monster with jagged teeth — are a relatively inexpensive status symbol at $27, though they routinely sell at a premium on the resale market. Now, high-end brands are testing whether Labubu fans are willing to pay luxury price points.

In June, a collection of 14 customized Labubus dressed in designs by Carhartt and Japanese brand Sacai raised $337,500 at auction with the top lot fetching $31,250. At the recent U.S. Open, tennis champion Naomi Osaka touted crystal-encrusted Labubus that cost some $500 from A-Morir. Due to high demand, the ""Lablingblings"" take four to six weeks for delivery, according to the New York custom eyewear and accessories maker.

Next up, the dolls are teaming up with Parisian maison Moynat. In just over two weeks, the fashion house is releasing a collection of handbags, leather accessories and, of course, bag charms that feature Labubus and two other characters by artist Kasing Lung, the Hong Kong Dutch artist who created Labubu. Moynat's signature monogrammed canvas totes start at $2,150 and bag charms retail for $450.

While Labubu mania is new, high-end brands from Tiffany to Loewe are increasingly featuring characters like Pikachu and Totoro to court younger and digitally savvy customers. Done right, these collaborations not only generate hype, but pay off.

Omega's ""Silver Snoopy"" Speedmaster watches are coveted collectors items, with its 2015 model, originally priced at $7,350, worth nearly $38,000 on the secondary market, according to market data provider WatchCharts. Jimmy Choo's two collections with Sailor Moon, with the most recent one released in October, quickly sold out. Some brands create their own endearing characters, like Louis Vuitton dropping a line of ""Louis Bear"" stuffed animal bag charms in July.

Boston Consulting Group's Jeff Lindquist told CNBC that these collaborations have picked up in popularity in the past decade to target customers who can afford high-end items but aren't fashion-obsessed.

""Cute is not trivial. It is strategic,"" said Lindquist, partner at BCG, where he advises luxury fashion and beauty brands. ""It performs incredibly well on platforms like TikTok where virality and cultural relevance are what drives the visibility and the desirability of the brands.""

Moynat's Bertrand Le Gall said the collaboration with Lung is a way for the 176-year-old maison to stay culturally relevant and resonate with customers.

""The cute elements, even though they have this deep artistic value and this deeper design value, I think we are playing on the emotional value of of everything,"" said Le Gall, the image and communication director. ""This emotional value is so important when it comes to a house like ours with a very long legacy and historical background.""

Gen Z customers are especially looking for emotional value, according to Lindquist. Many have pulled back their spending as they have felt the effect of inflation and see less value in traditional luxury goods.

""Gen Z sees luxury less as craftmanship and artistry and status and more as mirrors to their identities and their beliefs,"" he said.

Daniel Langer, professor of luxury strategy at Pepperdine University, compared the draw of characters to that of celebrities.

""The characters stand for something, and those characters also have a fan base,"" he said. ""There's people who really love them.""

But to drum up hype, collaborations, like Labubu blind boxes, should tap into the thrill of the hunt, he added. In the case of the Moynat collection, it will not retail online and only sell at one Moynat boutique at a time from Oct. 11 to early 2026

""Everyone who has a Labubu can tell a personal story about how they got them,"" said Langer, who described buying an authentic but reasonably priced one for his daughter as ""quite an undertaking.""

Capsule collections give brands the opportunity to experiment with new looks and broaden their audience, according to consultant Alexander Thiel.

""Collabs give you a license in the eye of the consumer to do something that otherwise for your brand would be unexpected and therefore opening it up to new audience,"" said Thiel, who led McKinsey's consumer packaged goods and retail business in Switzerland until September.

That said, brands run the risk of alienating their core audience, according to Thomai Serdari, marketing professor at New York University. For instance, while Loewe's three collections with Studio Ghibli were successful, it would not have made sense for a more traditional brand to sell Totoro purses or wallets with the mouse from ""Spirited Away.""

""In the case of Loewe, it made perfect sense, because they had an intentional shift from something very low-key and very traditional quiet luxury before the acquisition by LVMH,"" she said. ""Then within the portfolio of LVMH, they became the creative kid, the smaller brand that experiments and is playful.""

She also cautioned against trend chasing, saying a phenomenon like Labubu mania can ""collapse as quickly as it was built.""

Shares of Pop Mart, the manufacturer of Labubu dolls, have sunk by roughly 21% since peaking in late August on analyst fears that the frenzy is fading. However, the stock is still up nearly 200% year to date, and some analysts are still bullish on Pop Mart's prospects. HSBC's Lina Yan noted that Labubu only started actively collaborating with brands like Coca-Cola in 2024.

""The supply and demand of Labubus won't tilt 180 degrees,"" Yan wrote. ""We believe it is too early to call for a peak.""

It's too soon to judge Labubu's staying power. But Thiel said he thinks that the Labubu craze and influx of bag charms like Louis Bear indicate consumers are looking for innocent distractions from economic anxiety.

""We see that there's a lot of anxiety and a lot of uncertainty, and not only in the parts of the socioeconomic demographic that are struggling economically, but across all levels,"" he said. ""I think it's not surprising that there's a bit of clinging to wholesomeness and that element of cute. I think it speaks to something deeper.""

IREN (IREN), one of the largest self-operated BTC$113,937.21 miners in the U.S., is breaking away from the pack, and Wall Street is taking notice.

Bernstein analysts raised their price target on IREN to $75 from $20, implying about 80% upside, as the miner doubles down on building its own AI cloud business rather than relying on co-location deals with partners like CoreWeave (CRWV).

IREN has already had a major move, ahead more than eight-fold from its 52-week low of $5.13 hit in April. The shares are higher by 365% year-over-year.

The broker now sees IREN's AI pivot as credible, despite early skepticism about the miner's ability to execute on a capital-intensive data center build-out and compete with AI cloud players tied to hyperscalers and Nvidia (NVDA).

IREN is guiding for rapid growth, the report noted, with $500 million in annual recurring revenue by Q1 2026 on 23,300 GPUs, up from roughly $14 million in Q1 2025.

Beyond AI, IREN retains flexibility with its 3 gigawatt (GW) power portfolio, balancing bitcoin mining and AI workloads to maximize revenue per megawatt, Bernstein analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.

Its 50 EH/s mining operation generates an estimated $600 million in annualized EBITDA at current bitcoin prices, funding its AI expansion, according to the analysts.

Bernstein has shifted its valuation approach to a sum-of-parts model, assigning 87% of enterprise value to AI cloud and co-location potential at IREN's 2GW West Texas site, with the remaining 13% coming from bitcoin mining. 

At the revised target, IREN would trade at $7.5 million per megawatt (MW), above other AI-focused miners but still far below established data center peers like CoreWeave, suggesting further room for multiple expansion, the report added.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Bitcoin upgrade is splitting developers and purists","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-upgrade-core-developers","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

 Bitcoin Core proponents defend OP_RETURN changes as neutral, while critics warn of spam and capture. 

Bitcoin Core's next major upgrade has reignited old tensions in the community, pitting developers who want a neutral, fee-driven network against purists who see non-financial data as spam.

Bitcoin Core v30, expected in October, will remove the 80-byte cap on OP_RETURN, the part of a transaction script that allows users to embed arbitrary data.

Bitcoin Core is software that runs the Bitcoin network, maintained by an open group of developers but widely relied upon by miners and node operators. While alternatives such as Knots exist, Bitcoin Core is the protocol's reference implementation that is run by the majority of the network.

On the surface, the dispute looks like a policy debate over whether Bitcoin's blockchain should be reserved for financial means or opened up to broader uses. But beneath that, the controversy taps into deeper political fault lines, with some factions accusing Bitcoin Core of compromising principles or bending to outside influence.

Critics of Bitcoin Core v30 warn that removing the OP_RETURN cap could open the door to spam and resource drain. They argue that larger OP_RETURNs encourage non-monetary transactions that crowd out payments and increase the burden on nodes.

Supporters of the money-first philosophy see this as a misuse of the system, insisting that Bitcoin was designed as a peer-to-peer payments network, not as a data hosting service.

That view is embodied in Bitcoin Knots, an alternative client maintained by Luke Dashjr, which enforces stricter default policies to block what it classifies as non-financial data. Knots is designed to make it more difficult to relay or embed arbitrary content.

Related: Bitcoin Knots gain ground: Will a chain split kill BTC price?

Core developers defend their decision on different grounds. Gloria Zhao, a Bitcoin Core maintainer, said that those backing the change “aren't enthusiastic about data storage as a use case” but support a decentralized market for blockspace by not imposing relay rules that are stricter than what miners already accept.

“The existing standard methods (e.g. bare pubkeys) involve bloating the UTXO set, representing a long term cost to the network,” she said in a GitHub discussion thread, adding that OP_RETURN is prunable and less harmful.

Knots supporters counter that lifting the cap heightens the risk of illicit material being permanently inscribed on the blockchain. At the extreme, they point to the possibility of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) being recorded on Bitcoin if the cap is removed.

Bitcoin developer and advocate Jimmy Song — who is not a v30 supporter — rejected that argument, stating that data embedded in Bitcoin is “not readily accessible.”

“Core version 30 does not display any images or videos or play any audio,” Song said. “Running software that verifies whether a block or transaction is consistent with the rules of Bitcoin does not make you a party to whatever nefarious deeds the transaction concerned may be involved in.”

Beyond the technical debate, the v30 upgrade has stirred a political undercurrent over whether Bitcoin Core remains truly independent.

Critics have suggested that Core developers are favoring ventures like the layer-2 project Citrea, arguing that removing the OP_RETURN cap happens to align with the needs of rollups that rely on embedding larger data payloads into Bitcoin for validity proofs.

Others question the rhetoric of neutrality itself. They view the “fee-driven” approach as a way to normalize non-financial transactions, opening the door to non-fungible tokens and inscriptions.

Related: Lessons learned from a graduate-level Bitcoin class

Core developers reject these claims, stressing that decisions are made in the open on GitHub, Internet Relay Chat and the mailing list and dismiss suspicions of corporate capture as political spin from the “money-only” camp. For them, v30 is about letting the transaction fee market decide and keeping Bitcoin's rules neutral and transparent.

“If a small, socially engineerable ‘inner circle' truly made software decisions on behalf of the entire network, then Bitcoin is actually a very fragile system,” Zhao said.

The argument over OP_RETURN is ultimately about more than bytes and scripts. For critics, it is a battle to preserve Bitcoin's identity as sound money, free from the clutter of data experiments. For Core developers, it is about aligning software rules with what the network already accepts, leaving the market for blockspace to sort itself out.

Whether the change unleashes a wave of inscriptions or simply cleans up outdated relay rules, the upgrade forces the community to revisit a debate that has haunted Bitcoin since its early days.

As v30 approaches its October release, node operators, miners and businesses will choose whether to upgrade or hold back. That choice, repeated across thousands of machines worldwide, will determine not only the fate of the OP_RETURN cap but also how Bitcoin defines neutrality, independence and its future purpose.

The divide has resulted in the rise of Bitcoin Knots nodes. There were about 400 Bitcoin Knots nodes running on the Bitcoin network at the beginning of 2025. That number has grown to 4,713 nodes. There are currently 22,496 public nodes running on the Bitcoin network.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Why Is Solana Falling Harder Than Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP This Week?","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-solana-falling-harder-bitcoin-143519385.html","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 14:35:19 GMT","

Oops, something went wrong

Solana is underperforming its blue chip counterparts—like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP—because it's primed to take a bigger hit when investors deleverage and take profits, analysts told Decrypt.

“According to CoinGlass data, over the past 24 hours, market-wide liquidations exceeded $290 million, with highly leveraged and less liquid assets seeing sharper drawdowns—Solana being a prime example,” said Dean Chen, an analyst at crypto exchange Bitunix.

Solana derivatives contracts have accounted for $31.6 million worth of the forced selling in the past day, compared to $68.5 million for Ethereum and $52.2 million for Bitcoin liquidations. At the time of writing, Solana is trading for $213 after having dropped roughly 3% in the past day and more than 9% over the last week, according to crypto price aggregator CoinGecko.

Chen added that last week's bullish Solana treasury news from Forward Industries and DeFi Development Corp. was already priced in because the companies that bought had already announced their plans to do so.

Solana Treasury Firm Holdings Could Double as Forward Industries Unveils $4 Billion Raise

Forward, which trades on the NasdaqCM under the FORD ticker, announced its $1.65 billion raise and intent to buy Solana a few days before the SOL was acquired. And DeFi Development, which trades on the NasdaqCM under the DFDV ticker, has been buying Solana since April.

“Once the announcements became official, the market reacted with a classic ‘buy the rumor, sell the news' dynamic, prompting speculative holders to exit and accelerating the correction,” he said.

The SOL pullback has made users on Myriad, a prediction market owned by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, doubt whether the coin will see a new all-time high before the end of the year. As of this writing, predictors see even 50-50 odds that Solana will rise above the current record of $293.31 in 2025—but predictors were bullish earlier this week, giving a nearly 65% chance of it happening as of Sunday.

There are other factors at play, said Gordon Grant, portfolio manager and head of derivatives at crypto index fund manager Bitwise, He told Decrypt the large FTX estate distribution coming up at the end of the month “threw cold water on the market.”

“In terms of short-term positioning, the 15% pullback from $250 to $210 does not feel extreme given that SOL had rallied over 50% from its early August levels,” he said.

The FTX Recovery Trust said late last week that it would begin distributing another $1.6 billion worth of funds to creditors at the end of the month.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum reclaims USDT lead with $80 billion supply, surpassing Tron","https://www.theblock.co/post/371697/ethereum-reclaims-usdt-lead-surpassing-tron","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 14:56:02 GMT","

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Ethereum has reclaimed its position as the primary network for USDT supply, reaching $80 billion and surpassing Tron after falling behind earlier in March. This reversal represents a significant shift in stablecoin infrastructure preferences, with both networks maintaining relatively stable supply levels around $75-$80 billion throughout most of 2025. The close competition between these networks highlights the ongoing shifts in settlement dominance, with marginal advantages potentially driving substantial liquidity migrations.

The redistribution of USDT supply reflects evolving user preferences for blockchain infrastructure, particularly as traditional finance increasingly adopts stablecoin rails. Ethereum's resurgence suggests that users are prioritizing the network's established DeFi ecosystem and institutional-grade infrastructure over Tron's lower transaction costs. Daily stablecoin transfers on Ethereum have reached nearly 1 million transactions per day, indicating not just static holdings but active utilization of USDT for payments and settlements.



This shift occurs as traditional financial institutions increasingly integrate stablecoins into their payment infrastructure. Companies like PayPal with PYUSD and other traditional finance players are incorporating stablecoins into their existing rails, favoring Ethereum's more established institutional presence. The growing institutional adoption of stablecoins suggests that network effects and regulatory clarity will continue to be the main drivers of innovation and adoption.

The competitive dynamics between blockchains for stablecoin dominance carry broader implications for blockchain ecosystem development. The presence of large stablecoin volumes, such as USDT, influences cross-chain bridge activity, exchange integration strategies, and overall DeFi liquidity concentration. Ethereum's advantage in capturing institutional stablecoin flows could reinforce its position as the primary settlement layer for sophisticated financial applications, particularly as traditional finance continues to explore blockchain-based payment solutions.

Oops, something went wrong

Publicly traded electric vehicle charging firm Jiuzi Holdings is adopting a crypto investment policy, after its board of directors authorized the firm to deploy up to $1 billion into acquiring and holding Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB. 

Shares of JZXN jumped as high as $2.38 on the news, a 47% spike above its Tuesday closing price, before retracing completely. Shares are now down nearly 10% on the day and changing hands at $1.46. JZXN is down more than 99.9% in the last 5 years.

“Adopting the crypto asset investment policy represents a proactive step in our treasury management to safeguard and enhance long-term shareholder value,” said the firm's CEO Tao Li in a statement. 

Using a strict risk framework, the Chinese firm was authorized to allocate a portion of its cash reserves into BTC, ETH, and BNB. Any additional crypto tokens would need to be approved by the board prior to investment. 

While the board authorized up to $1 billion in crypto purchases, the firm's latest financial filing with the SEC indicates it only had around $943,000 in cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2024. The firm also reported a net income loss of around $55 million for the fiscal year ending on that day.

While some firms creating crypto treasuries raise funds via convertible notes or private investment into public equity (aka PIPE placements), there is no indication of how Jiuzi Holdings intends to raise funds to purchase up to $1 billion in crypto.

Why Is Solana Falling Harder Than Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP This Week?

A representative for the firm did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment.

The firm will not take custody of any of its crypto assets, and also created a crypto risk asset committee as part of its investment policy framework. 

“We are not engaging in short-term trading or speculation; rather, we view crypto assets as long-term stores of value to hedge against macroeconomic uncertainties,” said its newly appointed COO Dr. Doug Buerger, in a statement.

Bitcoin's recent 10% fall from its all-time high of $124,500 in early August has sparked speculation about whether this is just a healthy pullback or the beginning of a market top.

Now, popular analytics firm Glassnode has released its latest report suggesting that we could actually be witnessing a ‘historically late phase' of Bitcoin's current market cycle.

The most interesting takeaway from the report was Bitcoin's latest cycle being compared with the 2018-2022 and 2015-2018 bull runs.



In both those instances – and in the current stage – the same metrics flashed similar signals.

And in both cases, Bitcoin went on to reach an ATH within the following 2-3 months, which then marked the cycle's market top.

Read on as we unpack Bitcoin's latest fundamental signals with the help of DeepSeek. Spoiler alert: it's not all negative. In fact, there are plenty of positive signs.

And with that in mind, we'll also point you toward the best altcoins to buy right now.

Although institutional and long-term Bitcoin holders have grown increasingly wary of getting in at all-time highs, short-term holders have been aggressively adding the digital gold to their portfolios.

All in all, it's clear that Bitcoin is in a sensitive position right now, with macroeconomic factors like rate cuts and growing crypto clarity working in its favor, while exchange numbers and on-chain data also suggest we could see a potential deeper correction before rebounding.

Whatever the case, it's hard to argue against Bitcoin and crypto in general heading toward a brighter future.

If you want to ride that particular tailwind without getting caught up in short-term corrections or volatility, you'll be better off picking low-cap, high-potential gems that can deliver not only on hype but also on long-term vision.

Here are our top 3 suggestions, based on DeepSeek AI's expert analysis.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is easily the best crypto presale on the market right now, having already raised nearly $18M from early investors in just a few weeks.

Even better, there's no shortage of whale participation in this presale. For instance, two large whale buys scooped up nearly $100K worth of $HYPER just yesterday.

What's driving Bitcoin's growth? A game-changing mission to turbocharge the Bitcoin blockchain with Solana-like speed, scalability, and programmability.

Bitcoin Hyper is a Layer-2 solution that integrates with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), ditching the popular Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), in order to execute thousands of transactions simultaneously, effectively solving Bitcoin's age-old issue of sluggish speeds.



Even better, developers and users on Bitcoin won't have to sacrifice Bitcoin's native security to reap the benefits of Hyper's lightning-fast execution.

That's because Bitcoin Hyper batches the results of all transactions and submits a summary to Bitcoin's main chain.

You can interact with these applications by simply converting your Layer-1 Bitcoin into wrapped, Layer-2 compatible $BTC tokens via Bitcoin Hyper's non-custodial, decentralized canonical bridge.

According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction, the token could hit $0.32 by the end of 2025 – so a massive 2,300% ROI could be yours if you get in now.

1 $HYPER is currently available for just $0.012965, and here's our detailed guide on how to buy Bitcoin Hyper.

Visit Bitcoin Hyper's official website to learn more about how its canonical bridge ensures seamless access to Bitcoin's new Web3 environment.

While many might believe that Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a slightly out-of-the-pocket suggestion when crafting a long-term crypto portfolio, DeepSeek points out that its Dogecoin theme and rampant hype could make it the next 1000x crypto.

If you want to fully understand Maxi's potential, you need to be aware of his backstory.

Both Maxi and Dogecoin belong to the same family of Shiba Inu, but due to the OG crypto's fame, Maxi never received the love and appreciation from his family.

That ignited a fire within him, which he honed in the gym and in the charts, to now emerge as the ultimate Doge nemesis.

Maxi's plan is to dominate the meme coin market, potentially even surpassing Dogecoin in both market cap and raw returns. This mission is fueled by a roadmap that focuses on virality.



The developers have reserved a whopping 40% of the total token supply for promotional activities, including PR campaigns, influencer partnerships, and social media blitzes.

The token has the potential to hit $0.0024 by the end of this year – according to our $MAXI price prediction – giving you an eye-popping 820% return.

At the time of writing, the Maxi Doge presale has accumulated over $2.4M from early investors, with each token available for just $0.000259. Here's how to buy $MAXI in 4 simple steps.

Check out Maxi Doge's official website to learn all about its hatred for Dogecoin, roadmap, and tokenomics.

$BNB‘s recent run-up to new all-time highs, at a time when other mainstream tokens like $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, and $XRP are all either in red or barely in green for the month, have made it one of the best cryptos to watch right now.

Although conventional investing wisdom advises against getting in at ATHs, there's a high likelihood $BNB might not churn out the pullback you're waiting for.

Why? Because it just broke out of a 4-year long consolidation zone, which lasted from May 2021 to May 2025.



Since this breakout, $BNB is up over 50%, and according to this trading pattern, we can expect the token to charge toward $2,000 in the coming weeks.

We arrived at this target by measuring the width of the consolidation phase and projecting it onto the breakout level – according to the technical analysis playbook.

Interested? Buy $BNB today on Binance, or any of the other major crypto exchanges.

The long-awaited interest rate cut has arrived, and with it hopes that crypto prices may soar again across the board. Bitcoin (BTC 1.13%), which has been creeping up all month, gained 2% in the hours after the announcement. Ethereum (ETH 0.21%) gained more than 3%.

But what about the smaller coins? Some of them are certainly doing well. As of Sept. 18, Avalanche (AVAX -0.52%) had gained almost 20% in a week and Binance Coin (BNB -0.27%) was up almost 9% in the same time period. 

Even so, one notable aspect of this year's crypto summer is that only Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a handful of other coins have seen significant inflows, leaving other projects out in the cold. Crypto enthusiasts hope the Federal Reserve rate cut and expected raft of spot crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might be the boost altcoins need. Let's dive in and find out how realistic that might be.

Altcoins are usually defined as any cryptocurrency that isn't Bitcoin. And altcoin season is a time when prices of smaller cryptocurrencies rise. It is usually marked by a drop in Bitcoin's dominance of the crypto market, shifts in consumer sentiment, and a spike in altcoin trading volume.

For example, in the 2017-2018 altcoin season, Bitcoin's share of the total market cap fell below 35% while altcoins topped 45%, according to CoinMarketCap data. Similarly, at points in 2021, altcoins and Bitcoin each accounted for about 40% of the cash in crypto. 

We're a long way from that today. Bitcoin dominance is at almost 58%, with Ethereum at 13% and the rest of the altcoins at about 30%. The concentration of cash in Bitcoin has dropped slightly during the past month, but not enough to declare that altcoin season is upon us.

Altcoin season can be a time when some of those high-risk projects deliver strong returns. ""Can"" is the key word here -- many altcoins never get off the starting block and some fail completely.

It's almost a year since the cryptocurrency market started to shake off its long crypto winter. The crypto market cap set a new high in August. But as we've seen, only a few cryptos are driving those gains.

That's partly because this bull run has been characterized by increasing institutional inflows and mainstream interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. So far, the SEC has only approved spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Institutional investors are more interested in established projects and less willing to take risks on more speculative tokens and coins.

It isn't only institutional investors. Our research shows that if you had invested $200 in each of the top 20 altcoins during the last crypto boom four years ago, your portfolio would have been down about 30% as of a few weeks ago. Investors whose portfolios are still underwater may be more hesitant this time around.

Plus, the last altcoin season took place in 2021, when interest rates were low and an injection of pandemic stimulus cash made investors more willing to take risks. It's also worth noting that there are now many millions of cryptocurrencies out there compared with previous cryptocurrency bull runs. CoinMarketCap data shows there are more than 21 million cryptos now compared with less than 21,000 in 2021. It's still possible to find hidden crypto gems, but it's a lot harder.

Two of the factors weighing on altcoin prices could be changing. Here's how:

When interest rates are low, borrowing becomes cheaper. This can translate into more liquidity for riskier investments, including cryptocurrencies. Lower rates also make it harder for investors to earn decent yields on things like bonds and savings accounts, offering an incentive to consider riskier assets.

Spot altcoin ETFs would make it easier for both retail and institutional investors to invest. And we will probably see a lot more of them in the next month.

The SEC has just released new standards that would streamline the spot crypto ETF approval process. With about 90 crypto ETF applications already in the pipeline, this could open the floodgates. Not only that, but there will be more multi-crypto ETFs which would make it easier for investors to gain altcoin exposure. 

The boost from rate cuts and impending ETF approvals offers the best possible conditions for another altcoin season. However, every market cycle is different. The Fed's move hasn't triggered much of a crypto rally, in part because speculation had already pushed prices up beforehand. Not only that, but economic uncertainty and inflation concerns continue to weigh on investor sentiment.

Anything is possible in the unpredictable world of crypto. But the sheer volume of altcoins means it's unlikely we will see another broad rise in altcoin prices. However, as the ETF approvals start to come through, certain projects with strong fundamentals or sectors with solid use cases may benefit from an injection of institutional cash.

If you're considering adding altcoins to your portfolio, look for ways to manage the risk. For example, build a diversified mix of cryptocurrencies so you're not overly exposed to one or two sectors. And make sure that crypto only makes up a small part of your wider investments.

$8B in altcoin interest vanished as Binance volumes dropped and USDC gained on USDT.

Altcoin Open Interest dropped by $8 billion as Binance stablecoin trade volume fell below the key $150B level.

Yes, BTC dominance is rising as traders shift away from riskier altcoins amid heavy liquidations and stablecoin market changes.

Binance's stablecoin trade volume has slipped back to $150 billion.

This comes right as the altcoin market took a hit, with $8 billion in Open Interest wiped out. At the same time, Circle's USDC [USDC] is gaining ground on Tether [USDT], adding tension to the story.

Stablecoin Pair Trade Volume on Binance fell back to $150 billion, down from its July 2025 peak above $203 billion.

Patterns show that when volumes rise above this threshold, Ethereum [ETH] and the broader altcoin market tend to benefit. Once volumes slip below that line, performance weakens.

Meanwhile, USDC has grown from 5% at the start of the year to 13.58%, while USDT's dominance has slipped from 69.2% to around 63%.

FDUSD now accounts for 23.3%. The competition is intensifying, with stablecoin flows increasingly shaping liquidity and price action across altcoins.

Altcoin Open Interest dropped by $8 billion, a wipeout more than five times greater than Bitcoin's [BTC] $1.5 billion decline. This contraction means that altcoins unwound at a much faster pace than in BTC.

The gap between Bitcoin and the rest of the market narrowed as alt traders bore the brunt of liquidations. This showed weaker conviction in riskier assets compared to the relative stability of Bitcoin.

BTC Dominance rose to 58.56% at press time, showing a steady climb from the mid-month low near 57%.

This recovery came even as the Altcoin Season Index held high at 68, a sign of a clear disconnect. Traders favored Bitcoin's relative strength, while alts faced sharper unwinds.

Source: TradingView

With dominance climbing and altcoin Open Interest falling by $8 billion, risk appetite shifted back toward Bitcoin. That left alts more exposed in the near term.

Canton Network, a blockchain built for regulated finance, has struck a strategic partnership with Chainlink to broaden institutional adoption.

The agreement, announced Wednesday, will see Canton integrate Chainlink's suite of services, including Data Streams, Proof of Reserve, and its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol. Canton has also joined the Chainlink Scale program, which helps cover the costs of running oracle nodes that feed external data into blockchains.

Chainlink Labs will take on the role of Super Validator in Canton's Global Synchronizer, a system designed to keep transactions across the network in sync. That places Chainlink alongside a roster of more than 30 super validators and 500 validators already supporting Canton, which processes $280 billion in daily repo transactions and secures over $6 trillion in tokenized real-world assets.

For institutions, the deal could mean faster access to tokenized securities, stablecoins, and digital identity tools without sacrificing compliance or privacy. Imagine a bank issuing tokenized bonds on Canton and relying on Chainlink to confirm collateral values in real time—a scenario designed to cut costs while reducing counterparty risk.

Chainlink already secures more than $100 billion across decentralized finance and has helped facilitate $25 trillion in transaction value. Its entry into Canton aligns with growing demand from financial firms exploring tokenized assets and cross-chain applications.

“The collaboration brings together Canton's focus on regulated finance with Chainlink's infrastructure, paving the way for real-world institutional use cases,” Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in the release.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Fundstrat co-founder and BitMine Chairman Tom Lee said Ethereum is a ""truly neutral chain"" that will be favored by Wall Street and the White House.

""I don't think anyone ever feels that someone's got a fat finger tilting [Ethereum] in their favor,"" Lee said, during Korea Blockchain Week 2025's Impact conference on Wednesday. ""If you think about how Wall Street operates, they will only wanna do and operate on a neutral chain.""

Lee further explained that he observed the White House and Congress, which had become more pro-crypto under the Trump administration, are primarily turning to Ethereum.

""So when I look at that, combined with agentic AI and robots that are really gonna create the need for a token economy for robots, a lot of that will happen on Ethereum,"" Lee said. ""In fact, President Trump today just talked about how he needs proof-of-human to protect us, and a lot of that work is going to be done on Ethereum.""

When the Wall Street strategist engineered BitMine's transformation into an ETH treasury vehicle, Lee said he saw the possibility that Ethereum was entering a ""super cycle"" that would last 10 to 15 years. 

Since transitioning into an Ethereum treasury company, BitMine's market capitalization grew from around $37.6 million in June, before the transition, to around $9.45 billion as of Wednesday. 

BitMine is currently the largest Ethereum treasury in the world, holding 2.15 million ETH, according to The Block's corporate treasuries data. It is also the second largest crypto treasury firm overall, behind Michael Saylor's Strategy.



Lee said that he thinks there is room for more than one Ethereum treasury firms, but stated that the market is picking its winners and losers.

""Bitmine trades $3 billion a day, Microstrategy trades $3.4 billion a day. I think the two of us represent 95% of all trading volume in the DATs,"" Lee said. ""The two of us are 90% of the trading volume. That means institutions really only want to buy us.""

Lee said the two companies have essentially become large-cap stocks, and they are going to receive passive flows as they will become a part of major indices when they rebalance.

""That really helped MicroStrategy too, and that's actually what sustains valuation premiums, because now you have someone who's buying every day.""

Meanwhile, Lee said he expects bitcoin price to end the year between $200,000 and $250,000, while ether is expected to land between $10,000 and $12,000.

""I'm still bullish on bitcoin,"" Lee said during the conference discussion. ""In the fourth quarter, seasonally bitcoin is strong. But now we have the Fed flipping dovish after being essentially hawkish all year. That's a tailwind for bitcoin."" 

Lee added that his estimate aligns with Fundstrat CMT Mark Newton's technical targets. 

""Ethereum, as a price ratio to bitcoin, should recover to its prior, either average or at least five-year highs,"" Lee stated. ""Using a $250,000 Bitcoin, that implies somewhere between 10 and 12,000 for Ethereum by the end of the year.""

The BitMine chairman said he expects Ethereum to surpass its prior highs, and the cryptocurrency's ""real price discovery"" will be between $12,000 and $15,000. ""But I don't think that would be the ceiling for Ethereum,"" Lee added.

​The United Nations is set to educate governments on artificial intelligence and blockchain to drive public sector innovation.

​

The U.N. Development Programme on Monday announced a partnership with the Exponential Science Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to advancing the adoption of AI, blockchain and other emerging technologies, to launch the Government Blockchain Academy.

​

The academy, set to launch next year, will teach governments how to apply AI and blockchain to address development challenges, the U.N. agency working to eradicate poverty and inequality in 170 countries through sustainable development said.

The agency said that key areas of focus will include improving access to financial services, combating corruption through tamper-proof record-keeping and procurement transparency, enhancing the transparency of funding climate change initiatives and developing digital identity solutions.

​

""This is not just an educational initiative. It's a collective blueprint for public innovation,"" Exponential Science Foundation Executive Chair Paolo Tasca said. ""By bringing together diverse partners under one framework, we can ensure that governments have the tools and the talent they need to navigate the next wave of digital transformation.""

​​

The UNDP said the Global Blockchain Academy will provide both in-person and online training, access to incubation programs and expert mentorship.

​

While the exact launch date for the academy is unclear, the agency has a formal announcement planned for the TOKEN2049 blockchain and cryptocurrency conference, which is scheduled for Oct. 1-2 in Singapore. The formal announcement will include an industry roundtable to gather support for the initiative, the UNDP said.

​

The Government Blockchain Academy announcement comes as more countries explore emerging technologies to improve the public sector. Estonia, for example, employs blockchain to secure health records and code systems in its judiciary, legislature and security service. In 2018, the United Arab Emirates introduced a blockchain strategy to migrate government transactions on-chain. Even the U.S. has begun publishing economic data using blockchain.

​

Before the Government Blockchain Academy, the UNDP in 2023 announced a similar initiative for its staff called Blockchain Academy. That initiative saw the agency partner with the Algorand Foundation to train its 22,000 staff on the practical application of blockchain technology for sustainable development.

Bitcoin Holds Ground: Bitcoin (BTC) hovered around $113K after bouncing off ~$112K support, buoyed by improved risk sentiment following a U.S. Fed rate cut [18]. The global crypto market cap stayed just under $4 trillion with flat 24-hour movement [19]. However, most majors are still nursing weekly losses – BTC down ~2.8% over 7 days, ETH ~7% [20]. Altcoins like Solana and Dogecoin underperformed, with DOGE down 8.5% for the week [21]. A few outliers saw explosive gains: two little-known tokens surged over 50% in a day, highlighting lingering speculative fervor in corners of the market [22].

Cautious Sentiment: Traders remain wary. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell into fear territory at 39 (down from neutral levels above 50 last week). Analysts note that market liquidity is thinner, and large holders have been taking profits. On-chain data indicates whales led a recent wave of BTC selling, while companies and ETFs stepped in as buyers, helping form a price floor [23] [24]. “Businesses now hold more bitcoin than ETFs… Both will keep accelerating their accumulation,” observed fintech firm River, suggesting institutions are quietly soaking up supply [25].

Short-Term Outlook: In the near term, $114K–$116K is the key resistance zone for Bitcoin – a breakout above this range could open a run toward $120K [26]. Conversely, a drop below ~$111K support might send BTC back to the $108K level or lower [27]. Ethereum (ETH) is stuck around ~$4,180 in a tight range, needing a push above ~$4,300 to regain bullish momentum [28]. Should ETH slip under $4,100, traders eye $3,950 as the next line in the sand [29]. In the coming days, macro catalysts – from U.S. regulatory hearings to Asia's crypto policy announcements – could inject volatility [30] [31]. For now, markets are in wait-and-see mode, with many participants reluctant to take big bets until a clearer trend emerges.

In a rare show of unity, the United States and United Kingdom unveiled a joint U.S.–U.K. Taskforce on Crypto and Capital Markets [32]. Announced on Sept. 22 by UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the task force brings together officials from both nations' Treasuries and regulators [33]. Its mandate: align rules for digital assets and cross-border trading, and deliver policy recommendations within 180 days through the existing UK–US Financial Regulatory Working Group [34] [35]. “London and New York remain the twin pillars of global finance,” Chancellor Reeves noted, emphasizing that closer alignment is essential as technology reshapes markets [36]. Bessent echoed that ensuring fintech innovation “does not stop at borders” is a shared priority [37].

Why it matters: Industry leaders hail the move as a potential global benchmark. “With a joint task force on digital assets, we can expect meaningful developments on both sides of the Atlantic,” said Mark Aruliah of blockchain analytics firm Elliptic [38]. He suggested this could close the regulatory gap and “strengthen a shared commitment to higher standards of transparency and accountability” in crypto markets [39]. In plain terms, the two financial powerhouses are teaming up to avoid contradictory rules and create a more unified framework. This could ease compliance burdens for crypto companies operating internationally and encourage cross-border investment. Observers note the timing is critical: the EU and other countries are advancing their own crypto regimes, and a coordinated Anglo-American approach might influence global norms.

Meanwhile in Washington, Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) plans hit a roadblock. House Republicans quietly added an “anti-CBDC” provision into a must-pass defense funding bill (the NDAA) on Sept. 23 [40] [41]. The amendment would prohibit the Federal Reserve from creating or testing a digital U.S. dollar – effectively any retail CBDC – unless explicitly authorized by Congress [42]. It even bars the Fed from intermediaries offering a CBDC by proxy [43]. This legislative maneuver piggybacks on Rep. Tom Emmer's earlier CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, reflecting deep skepticism of a government-controlled digital currency [44].

Lawmakers backing the ban frame it as protecting privacy and freedom. Emmer warned that without safeguards, an American CBDC could become a “CCP-style surveillance tool”, trading away financial privacy [45]. He touted the House measure as insurance that “unelected bureaucrats are NEVER allowed” to implement such tech [46]. President Donald Trump's stance looms large here – he has railed against CBDCs as “a dangerous threat to freedom” and in January 2025 issued an executive order halting all federal work on a digital dollar [47]. With Trump in office, the U.S. has effectively frozen its CBDC project; Republicans now seek to codify that freeze into law, so a future administration can't easily revive it [48] [49].

Context: This U.S. skepticism stands in stark contrast to the global trend. Over 130 countries are exploring or piloting CBDCs, including major economies like China, India, and the EU [50] [51]. Three countries (Bahamas, Jamaica, Nigeria) have even launched retail CBDCs [52]. Proponents argue a digital dollar could modernize payments and keep the U.S. competitive. But privacy concerns resonate strongly with the American public and politicians – the idea of government traceable transactions raises red flags. For now, the U.S. is charting an outlier path, prioritizing stablecoins (private digital dollars) over any Fed-issued token [53]. The House's anti-CBDC rider still faces Senate scrutiny, but it signals a clear message: under current leadership, no digital dollar will see the light of day [54].

Not all regulators are pumping the brakes. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) made a groundbreaking move to integrate tokenized assets into mainstream markets. Acting CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham announced a new initiative allowing stablecoins and tokenized treasuries as collateral in derivatives clearing [55]. She hailed it as the “killer app to modernize markets”, saying smarter use of digital dollars can unleash economic growth by lowering costs in trading and settlement [56]. In essence, the CFTC is greenlighting real-world use of crypto tokens (like dollar-pegged stablecoins) in regulated futures and options markets – a significant nod of legitimacy to blockchain finance.

Industry experts are enthusiastic but cautious. Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder of oracle provider RedStone, called the move a “watershed moment” that brings tokenization from concept to reality [57]. By accepting crypto collateral, regulators validate a core DeFi (decentralized finance) idea – that on-chain tokens can interoperate with traditional finance. However, Kazmierczak stressed the need for robust infrastructure: “Even a one-second delay or error in a price feed can destabilize a protocol,” he noted, underscoring that real-time, reliable data will be essential [58]. The scale challenge is also huge: if institutions start using tokenized assets, systems must handle thousands of chains and hundreds of thousands of assets while meeting Wall Street's precision and risk standards [59].

Big picture: The CFTC's embrace of tokenized collateral could redefine DeFi's role. It blurs the line between regulated markets and crypto-native innovation, potentially opening trillions in liquidity for crypto use. Imagine banks and hedge funds posting stablecoins instead of cash for trades – that's the vision. Pham's initiative will proceed with industry partners (Circle, Coinbase and others were tagged in her announcement tweet [60]), likely via pilot programs. If successful, it could accelerate adoption of digital dollars in finance and give U.S. markets an edge in efficiency. It also signals to the world that U.S. regulators see value in blockchain tech – a stance that might encourage other countries to follow suit, even as the U.S. remains wary of a Fed CBDC.

A crypto ETF bonanza is on the horizon. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved new standards that streamline the launch of crypto exchange-traded funds [61]. Crucially, the SEC will no longer require case-by-case reviews for each crypto ETF if it meets certain criteria – for example, if the underlying asset has been traded on regulated markets or via futures for 6+ months [62]. This rule change, passed last week, slashes typical approval timelines from up to 270 days down to just 75 days or less [63]. It's a seismic shift that had asset managers lining up filings for new funds tied to various cryptocurrencies.

Analysts expect the first beneficiaries will be ETFs for Solana and XRP, potentially debuting in early October [64]. “We've got about a dozen filings with the SEC now, and more coming,” said Steven McClurg, whose firm designs crypto ETFs. “We're all getting ready for a wave of launches.” [65] The fourth quarter of 2025 is shaping up as “boom time for crypto ETF issuers,” added Jonathan Groth of DGIM Law [66]. Indeed, 21 crypto ETFs (mostly Bitcoin and Ether) already trade in the U.S., and many more – from solana to dogecoin ETFs – are in the pipeline [67] [68].

One early mover: Grayscale Investments converted its private Crypto 5 Trust into a public ETF within 48 hours of the rule change [69]. The new Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto 5 ETF holds a basket of Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano [70]. Grayscale's CEO hailed the approval as a win for “public market access, regulatory clarity and product innovation.” [71] Other firms from Bitwise to VanEck are racing to update their filings. “Not all of our existing filings qualify,” noted VanEck's Kyle DaCruz, “the next step is to see which products can move forward and how rapidly they get to market.” [72] He predicted “a flood of tokens that many folks have never heard of” coming to ETF menus, compressing years of market education into weeks [73]. The big unknown: investor appetite. Will retail and institutions pour money into a dozen niche crypto ETFs? Or will products for smaller coins struggle to attract volume? That remains to be seen, but the regulatory logjam has clearly broken, opening the door to a new era of crypto financial products.

One of Europe's banking giants, Deutsche Bank, made headlines with a report envisioning Bitcoin on central bank balance sheets by 2030 [74]. The German lender suggested that as Bitcoin matures, central banks may hold it alongside gold as a hedge asset – essentially treating Bitcoin as “digital gold” for reserve purposes [75]. The report pointed to several supporting trends. First, Bitcoin's notorious price volatility has been fading: in August, its 30-day volatility hit historic lows even as BTC reached record prices above $123,500 [76] [77]. This hints that Bitcoin is decoupling from speculative frenzies and behaving more like a stable store of value. Second, institutional interest and inflation hedging are driving adoption. With global inflation lingering and debt levels high, more investors (and some governments) are diversifying into hard assets. Signs of diversification are emerging – China, for instance, cut its U.S. Treasury holdings by $57 billion in 2024, the report noted, implying room for alternatives like crypto [78].

Deutsche Bank does not predict Bitcoin will replace the dollar or become a dominant reserve currency [79]. Rather, they see it coexisting with gold as a complementary reserve asset, especially for countries looking to hedge dollar exposure or financial instability [80]. Neither Bitcoin nor gold is likely to dethrone the dollar, the analysts wrote, as governments will act to protect their monetary sovereignty [81]. But much as gold went from skepticism to staple of central bank vaults, Bitcoin could follow a similar adoption trajectory [82]. Over the next decade, as regulatory frameworks solidify and crypto markets deepen, holding a small portion of reserves in Bitcoin might become conventional for central banks – especially in nations seeking independence from U.S. monetary policy.

Implications: This is a long-term projection, but coming from a major bank it carries weight. If Bitcoin is even partially embraced in official reserves, it would mark a profound integration of crypto into the global financial system. It could also reinforce Bitcoin's narrative as “digital gold,” potentially boosting its valuation and stability (since central banks are ultra-long-term holders). We're already seeing baby steps: El Salvador's central bank holds BTC after making it legal tender, and some sovereign wealth funds reportedly buy crypto. Deutsche Bank's thesis suggests such moves could broaden significantly by 2030. For now, it's speculative – many central bankers still balk at Bitcoin's risks – but the report underlines a growing recognition: crypto is here to stay, and even the most traditional institutions may eventually adapt.

Despite the ups and downs, big money continues to flow into crypto ventures. New York-based VC firm Archetype announced it has raised $100 million for its third fund to back early-stage blockchain startups [83]. Impressively, the fund's backers include pension funds, university endowments, and a sovereign wealth fund – investors once wary of crypto who are now seeking exposure via venture bets [84]. Archetype, led by founder Ash Egan, deliberately kept the fund smaller and more “concentrated” to focus on high-conviction investments, bringing on only one new limited partner in the process [85] [86]. “Running a concentrated $100M fund lets us be extremely selective… we operate with a single goal — to ensure crypto teams are positioned to win,” Egan said [87].

Archetype has a strong track record – it seeded Privy (a crypto wallet startup acquired by Stripe) and US Bitcoin Corp (which merged with miner Hut 8) [88] [89]. The firm now manages ~$350 million, including sizable stakes in major assets like Solana and Ethereum [90]. The new fund has already begun deploying capital into undisclosed deals, targeting projects that can bring crypto to mainstream consumers [91]. Egan noted there's “no silver bullet for mainstream crypto adoption,” but the endgame is to deliver products as seamless as Web2 apps yet better aligned with users and creators [92]. In practice, that means investing in areas like user-friendly wallets, decentralized social platforms, Web3 games, and fintech bridges – anything that can onboard millions without them needing deep crypto knowledge.

This aligns with a broader trend: institutional adoption creeping forward. Recent data shows companies and investment funds (like ETFs) are steadily accumulating Bitcoin, even as early retail adopters take profits [93]. Major asset managers have launched crypto offerings (BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF filing last year was a catalyst), and traditional finance giants are entering DeFi – for instance, JPMorgan's blockchain unit and exchange projects by Nasdaq and others. Each incremental step – venture funding, ETF approvals, positive research from banks – is knitting crypto more tightly into the fabric of mainstream finance. The presence of pension and endowment money in a crypto VC fund like Archetype's is a strong signal: the narrative has shifted from “will crypto survive?” to “how can we profit if it succeeds?”. As Egan put it, the goal now is to make crypto products that everyday users will embrace, often without realizing there's blockchain under the hood [94]. That long-term infrastructure play is well underway, even if the headlines often focus on daily price swings.

In the decentralized finance (DeFi) arena, a noteworthy launch is bridging political and tech worlds. World Liberty Financial (WLF) – a DeFi project with ties to the Trump family – revealed plans for a USD₁ stablecoin ecosystem aimed at everyday payments [95]. At Korea Blockchain Week, WLF co-founder Zak Folkman announced a “very soon” rollout of a crypto debit card and retail app [96]. The USD₁ stablecoin is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, and the new app will merge peer-to-peer transfers with crypto trading features, providing a one-stop mobile wallet [97] [98]. Most notably, the WLF debit card will integrate with Apple Pay, allowing users to spend the USD₁ stablecoin at regular merchants as easily as using a phone tap [99]. This kind of fintech crossover – crypto dollars in your Apple Wallet – is a bid to make stablecoins a daily currency for the masses.

WLF's initiative is ambitious. By partnering with existing payment rails (like Apple Pay and presumably Visa/Mastercard through the debit card), they hope to sidestep one of crypto's biggest hurdles: real-world acceptance. You could pay for groceries or an Uber by debiting your crypto balance, while the merchant gets paid in fiat – all invisible to the user. Similar attempts (e.g. Coinbase's USDC Visa card) have launched before, but WLF is touting a full retail app that also lets users swap and send crypto. The project's political connections add intrigue: being “Trump family-backed,” it's reportedly part of a broader vision to promote an alternative US stablecoin. In fact, Pakistan's government recently mentioned working with World Liberty as it explores bitcoin mining and reserves [100], showing the project's international reach.

DeFi Evolution: Beyond WLF, DeFi innovation continues at a breakneck pace. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are proliferating – for example, Hyperliquid DEX just launched a USDH stablecoin and is drawing volume in a heated battle for traders [101]. Protocols are racing to offer higher yields and novel services (from on-chain asset management to undercollateralized lending). However, regulators are watching closely; the era of “DeFi in the shadows” is ending as projects engage with compliance (or face enforcement). The integration of stablecoins into regulated markets, as championed by the CFTC's move, could greatly benefit DeFi platforms by legitimizing their collateral and expanding liquidity [102] [103]. We're also seeing more real-world assets (RWA) on-chain – everything from tokenized Treasury bills to tokenized real estate shares – to blend traditional finance with DeFi's efficiency. In short, DeFi is gradually shedding its outlaw image and going mainstream, often with cooperation from regulators and TradFi institutions. World Liberty's consumer-friendly stablecoin app is one example of that trend: it aims to make interacting with DeFi-backed money as routine as using a bank app, without users needing to understand the complex smart contracts underneath.

The once red-hot NFT market has cooled significantly in 2025, entering what insiders dub an “NFT winter.” Trading volumes for digital collectibles have collapsed by about 97% from their euphoric peak in early 2022 [104]. Back then, monthly NFT sales topped $17 billion; now it's only a few hundred million [105]. Floor prices of even blue-chip NFT collections (like Bored Apes and CryptoPunks) have fallen 70–90% from all-time highs [106]. The bust has been painful for investors who chased jpegs at sky-high prices. Marketplace leader OpenSea saw activity drop so much that it lost market share and had to cut fees, although it's shown signs of a comeback in early 2025 by adding new features and even teasing its own token launch [107].

Yet, the NFT story is far from over – it's evolving, not dying. The downturn flushed out flippers and forced a focus on real utility. Successful projects now emphasize community, brand partnerships, and tangible benefits rather than speculation. Notably, Pudgy Penguins (a whimsical cartoon penguin NFT line) emerged as a top performer, recording $72 million in sales in Q1 2025 – up 13% year-on-year [108]. They achieved this by expanding beyond art: Pudgy Penguins launched physical merchandise and licensing deals, effectively turning their NFTs into a multimedia brand. Another example: Starbucks. The coffee giant's Odyssey program sold 2,000 NFT “Journey Stamps” (digital membership collectibles) that sold out in minutes, offering customers exclusive perks and experiences [109]. This showed that when framed as loyalty rewards, NFTs can succeed with mainstream consumers who might not even realize they're using crypto tech. Nike, Adidas, and Gucci likewise continue to experiment with NFTs for customer engagement, treating them as long-term brand plays rather than quick-profit assets [110].

Meanwhile, the rise of Web3 gaming and new NFT use cases provides a bright spot. Projects like Parallel (a sci-fi card game) launched NFT collections with novel mechanics (e.g. tiered rarity card packs) that appeal to gamers, not just collectors [111]. And the concept of Bitcoin Ordinals – NFTs inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain – gained traction in 2024, bringing NFT culture to the original crypto network [112]. Magic Eden, a marketplace that embraced Ordinals early, managed to capture the largest share of that emerging market by August 2024 [113]. This cross-pollination of communities hints at a future where NFTs are standard across many chains and platforms, each serving different niches.

The Road Ahead for NFTs: The froth and frenzy have subsided, but a core of dedicated builders and collectors remains. We're seeing an industry reset: projects must demonstrate real value – whether it's art that people truly love, in-game items with utility, or membership tokens that confer VIP access. As one analysis put it, the shakeout is “forcing projects and platforms to prioritize utility, sustainability, and community over mere hype and profit” [114]. Long-term, this maturation is healthy. It's weeding out cash-grabs and funneling energy into NFTs that can revolutionize digital content ownership, music rights, event ticketing, and more. Already, major entertainment companies are exploring NFTs for fan clubs and IP licensing, and startups are working on NFT-based tickets to combat fraud in concerts and sports. If the broader crypto market stabilizes and usability improves (e.g. wallet apps become as easy as using email), NFTs could well have another renaissance – but a more pragmatic, utility-driven one.

In summary, the crypto and blockchain space saw a whirlwind 48 hours of developments on Sept 23–24, 2025, touching every corner of the industry. From markets finding their footing after a pullback, to governments and regulators setting new guardrails, to big institutions and funds doubling down on crypto bets, and innovators pushing DeFi and NFTs into everyday life, it's clear that this ecosystem is both maturing and constantly on the move. “The end game is to deliver products at parity with Web2…better aligned with users,” as investor Ash Egan remarked [115] – and the news of this week shows that vision unfolding. In the short term there will be volatility and debate, but in the long term, the foundations laid now – whether in policy cooperation, technological integration, or institutional adoption – are shaping a future where crypto is more accessible, regulated, and integrated into the global economy than ever before.

Register now to hear from inspiring guest speakers and experts on subjects like cyber security, artificial intelligence and legislative reform.  

We have issued an enforcement notice to Bristol City Council (BCC) for failing to comply with its legal obligations to respond to people who asked for the personal information the council held on them – known as a subject access request (SAR). 

Sally-Anne Poole, Head of Investigations at the ICO, said: 

“Subject access requests are a fundamental right that allows people to know what information organisations hold about them and how it is being used. Despite our repeated engagement with Bristol City Council over a sustained period of time, limited progress has been made to clear a backlog of requests. Our investigation has found that the Council's approach towards compliance demonstrates a poor organisational attitude towards data rights and compliance with the law. This enforcement notice requires them to clear their SAR backlog in a timely manner, and make lasting improvements to bring their practices in line with the law.” 

The full enforcement notice can be read here. 

 

The enforcement notice requires BCC to take the following actions: 

People have the right to ask an organisation for the personal data they hold about them, why they are holding it and who they are sharing it with. A person can make a SAR verbally or in writing, including via social media. A person does not need to use a specific form of words, refer to legislation or direct the request to a specific contact. 

You can find guidance on making a SAR on the ICO website. 

If you have concerns about an organisation's response, you can raise a complaint with them directly and then, if unresolved, report it to us.

Speaking at a Bloomberg Future of Finance event in Frankfurt, Cipollone said the effort to create a digital euro had a “major breakthrough” last week when relevant finance chiefs reached an agreement on how to set customer holding limits, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.

The effort now has momentum, Cipollone said, according to the report.

The European Parliament, whose legislation is required to enable the digital euro, is set to receive a progress report on the initiative on Oct. 24 and could vote on the required legislation by May 2026, Cipollone said, per the report.

It was reported Sunday (Sept. 21) that European Union finance ministers agreed on a roadmap for launching a digital euro backed by the European Central Bank and that their input was considered crucial to assuage fears that a digital currency could lead to a run on traditional bank deposits.

In February, it was reported that the European Central Bank was hoping that progress on legislative approval for a digital euro would be spurred by U.S. President Donald Trump's endorsement of dollar-pegged stablecoins.

The European Commission put forward digital euro legislation in June 2023, but progress had been sluggish.

Cipollone said in the February report that Trump's support for stablecoins tied to the U.S. dollar introduced another American-driven financial tool and increased the urgency to move forward with a digital euro.

In March, it was reported that European Stability Mechanism Managing Director Pierre Gramegna said that Europe's monetary autonomy and financial stability could be threatened by the Trump administration's interest in cryptocurrencies and dollar-denominated stablecoins.

Gramegna said that in light of the change in the U.S. perception of digital currencies, the ESM believed that “this digital euro is today more necessary than ever.”

Cipollone said Sept. 4 that the European Union should accelerate its efforts to introduce a digital euro, in part because this technology would support resilience and inclusiveness.

A digital euro would complement physical cash, which remains essential for resilience and inclusion, and would provide another universally accepted means of payment, Cipollone said.

“In an increasingly digital world exposed to new geopolitical and operational risks, we must protect the euro's availability for all Europeans at all times,” Cipollone said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","Digital euro unlikely to launch before 2029, ECB board member says","https://cointelegraph.com/news/digital-euro-mid-2029-fair-assessment-ecb-cipollone","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 10:34:33 GMT","

 Introduced in October 2020, Europe's digital euro may not launch until 2029, according to ECB Executive Board member Piero Cipollone. 

The digital euro, the European Union's long-planned central bank digital currency (CBDC) project, is facing delays, with its launch now expected around mid-2029.

The EU's digital euro could become a reality in 2029, European Central Bank Executive Board member Piero Cipollone said in a Bloomberg Future of Finance event Tuesday in Frankfurt.

“The middle of 2029 could be a fair assessment,” he said, adding that the ECB has been actively discussing the project at the level of EU member states.

If correct, Cipollone's timeline would signal another delay for the digital euro, despite widespread calls to launch the CBDC to protect Europe's financial sovereignty amid the US stablecoin push.

According to Cipollone, the European Parliament has been the biggest obstacle to progress toward a digital euro, as it must pass legislation to move forward with the project.

“We should arrive at a general approach, as they call it, an agreement among member-states by the end of the year,” he said, adding that the Parliament is likely to have a position on a digital euro by May 2026.

Cipollone's assessment on Europe's CBDC launch came soon after EU ministers reached a “compromise” on the digital euro roadmap last week, imposing holding limits on the potential digital currency.

“The compromise that we reached is that before the ECB makes a final decision in relation to issuance [...] there would be an opportunity for a discussion in the Council of Ministers,” Irish Finance Minister and Eurogroup President Paschal Donohoe said at a news conference last Friday.

While Cipollone expects the digital euro won't launch before mid-2029, European authorities are pressing ahead with CBDC preparations, with the ECB targeting October to decide whether to move to the next phase.

A spokesperson for the ECB told Cointelegraph on Wednesday that a member of the European Parliament (MEP) is expected to deliver a progress report on the digital euro on Oct. 24.

Following the report, lawmakers will have six weeks to put forward amendments and a further five months for discussions, Cipollone reportedly said.

Officially introduced by the ECB in October 2020, the digital euro project has emerged as one of Europe's longest-discussed financial initiatives.

In June 2023, the European Commission published a legal proposal for a potential digital euro, yet progress within the European Parliament has remained limited.

Meanwhile, the ECB has steadily advanced the project, completing its investigation phase in November 2023 and moving into a preparation phase set to finish by October 2025.

Despite these steps, the initiative has faced significant skepticism from banks, lawmakers, member states, as well as end users, largely due to concerns around CBDC privacy.

Globally, some central banks have piloted their own digital currencies for years. China, for example, launched a pilot digital yuan wallet in early 2022. However, the digital yuan has encountered slow adoption, with critics describing many CBDCs as costly fiat replicas rather than genuine fintech innovations.

Bitcoin Holds Ground: Bitcoin (BTC) hovered around $113K after bouncing off ~$112K support, buoyed by improved risk sentiment following a U.S. Fed rate cut [18]. The global crypto market cap stayed just under $4 trillion with flat 24-hour movement [19]. However, most majors are still nursing weekly losses – BTC down ~2.8% over 7 days, ETH ~7% [20]. Altcoins like Solana and Dogecoin underperformed, with DOGE down 8.5% for the week [21]. A few outliers saw explosive gains: two little-known tokens surged over 50% in a day, highlighting lingering speculative fervor in corners of the market [22].

Cautious Sentiment: Traders remain wary. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell into fear territory at 39 (down from neutral levels above 50 last week). Analysts note that market liquidity is thinner, and large holders have been taking profits. On-chain data indicates whales led a recent wave of BTC selling, while companies and ETFs stepped in as buyers, helping form a price floor [23] [24]. “Businesses now hold more bitcoin than ETFs… Both will keep accelerating their accumulation,” observed fintech firm River, suggesting institutions are quietly soaking up supply [25].

Short-Term Outlook: In the near term, $114K–$116K is the key resistance zone for Bitcoin – a breakout above this range could open a run toward $120K [26]. Conversely, a drop below ~$111K support might send BTC back to the $108K level or lower [27]. Ethereum (ETH) is stuck around ~$4,180 in a tight range, needing a push above ~$4,300 to regain bullish momentum [28]. Should ETH slip under $4,100, traders eye $3,950 as the next line in the sand [29]. In the coming days, macro catalysts – from U.S. regulatory hearings to Asia's crypto policy announcements – could inject volatility [30] [31]. For now, markets are in wait-and-see mode, with many participants reluctant to take big bets until a clearer trend emerges.

In a rare show of unity, the United States and United Kingdom unveiled a joint U.S.–U.K. Taskforce on Crypto and Capital Markets [32]. Announced on Sept. 22 by UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the task force brings together officials from both nations' Treasuries and regulators [33]. Its mandate: align rules for digital assets and cross-border trading, and deliver policy recommendations within 180 days through the existing UK–US Financial Regulatory Working Group [34] [35]. “London and New York remain the twin pillars of global finance,” Chancellor Reeves noted, emphasizing that closer alignment is essential as technology reshapes markets [36]. Bessent echoed that ensuring fintech innovation “does not stop at borders” is a shared priority [37].

Why it matters: Industry leaders hail the move as a potential global benchmark. “With a joint task force on digital assets, we can expect meaningful developments on both sides of the Atlantic,” said Mark Aruliah of blockchain analytics firm Elliptic [38]. He suggested this could close the regulatory gap and “strengthen a shared commitment to higher standards of transparency and accountability” in crypto markets [39]. In plain terms, the two financial powerhouses are teaming up to avoid contradictory rules and create a more unified framework. This could ease compliance burdens for crypto companies operating internationally and encourage cross-border investment. Observers note the timing is critical: the EU and other countries are advancing their own crypto regimes, and a coordinated Anglo-American approach might influence global norms.

Meanwhile in Washington, Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) plans hit a roadblock. House Republicans quietly added an “anti-CBDC” provision into a must-pass defense funding bill (the NDAA) on Sept. 23 [40] [41]. The amendment would prohibit the Federal Reserve from creating or testing a digital U.S. dollar – effectively any retail CBDC – unless explicitly authorized by Congress [42]. It even bars the Fed from intermediaries offering a CBDC by proxy [43]. This legislative maneuver piggybacks on Rep. Tom Emmer's earlier CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, reflecting deep skepticism of a government-controlled digital currency [44].

Lawmakers backing the ban frame it as protecting privacy and freedom. Emmer warned that without safeguards, an American CBDC could become a “CCP-style surveillance tool”, trading away financial privacy [45]. He touted the House measure as insurance that “unelected bureaucrats are NEVER allowed” to implement such tech [46]. President Donald Trump's stance looms large here – he has railed against CBDCs as “a dangerous threat to freedom” and in January 2025 issued an executive order halting all federal work on a digital dollar [47]. With Trump in office, the U.S. has effectively frozen its CBDC project; Republicans now seek to codify that freeze into law, so a future administration can't easily revive it [48] [49].

Context: This U.S. skepticism stands in stark contrast to the global trend. Over 130 countries are exploring or piloting CBDCs, including major economies like China, India, and the EU [50] [51]. Three countries (Bahamas, Jamaica, Nigeria) have even launched retail CBDCs [52]. Proponents argue a digital dollar could modernize payments and keep the U.S. competitive. But privacy concerns resonate strongly with the American public and politicians – the idea of government traceable transactions raises red flags. For now, the U.S. is charting an outlier path, prioritizing stablecoins (private digital dollars) over any Fed-issued token [53]. The House's anti-CBDC rider still faces Senate scrutiny, but it signals a clear message: under current leadership, no digital dollar will see the light of day [54].

Not all regulators are pumping the brakes. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) made a groundbreaking move to integrate tokenized assets into mainstream markets. Acting CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham announced a new initiative allowing stablecoins and tokenized treasuries as collateral in derivatives clearing [55]. She hailed it as the “killer app to modernize markets”, saying smarter use of digital dollars can unleash economic growth by lowering costs in trading and settlement [56]. In essence, the CFTC is greenlighting real-world use of crypto tokens (like dollar-pegged stablecoins) in regulated futures and options markets – a significant nod of legitimacy to blockchain finance.

Industry experts are enthusiastic but cautious. Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder of oracle provider RedStone, called the move a “watershed moment” that brings tokenization from concept to reality [57]. By accepting crypto collateral, regulators validate a core DeFi (decentralized finance) idea – that on-chain tokens can interoperate with traditional finance. However, Kazmierczak stressed the need for robust infrastructure: “Even a one-second delay or error in a price feed can destabilize a protocol,” he noted, underscoring that real-time, reliable data will be essential [58]. The scale challenge is also huge: if institutions start using tokenized assets, systems must handle thousands of chains and hundreds of thousands of assets while meeting Wall Street's precision and risk standards [59].

Big picture: The CFTC's embrace of tokenized collateral could redefine DeFi's role. It blurs the line between regulated markets and crypto-native innovation, potentially opening trillions in liquidity for crypto use. Imagine banks and hedge funds posting stablecoins instead of cash for trades – that's the vision. Pham's initiative will proceed with industry partners (Circle, Coinbase and others were tagged in her announcement tweet [60]), likely via pilot programs. If successful, it could accelerate adoption of digital dollars in finance and give U.S. markets an edge in efficiency. It also signals to the world that U.S. regulators see value in blockchain tech – a stance that might encourage other countries to follow suit, even as the U.S. remains wary of a Fed CBDC.

A crypto ETF bonanza is on the horizon. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved new standards that streamline the launch of crypto exchange-traded funds [61]. Crucially, the SEC will no longer require case-by-case reviews for each crypto ETF if it meets certain criteria – for example, if the underlying asset has been traded on regulated markets or via futures for 6+ months [62]. This rule change, passed last week, slashes typical approval timelines from up to 270 days down to just 75 days or less [63]. It's a seismic shift that had asset managers lining up filings for new funds tied to various cryptocurrencies.

Analysts expect the first beneficiaries will be ETFs for Solana and XRP, potentially debuting in early October [64]. “We've got about a dozen filings with the SEC now, and more coming,” said Steven McClurg, whose firm designs crypto ETFs. “We're all getting ready for a wave of launches.” [65] The fourth quarter of 2025 is shaping up as “boom time for crypto ETF issuers,” added Jonathan Groth of DGIM Law [66]. Indeed, 21 crypto ETFs (mostly Bitcoin and Ether) already trade in the U.S., and many more – from solana to dogecoin ETFs – are in the pipeline [67] [68].

One early mover: Grayscale Investments converted its private Crypto 5 Trust into a public ETF within 48 hours of the rule change [69]. The new Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto 5 ETF holds a basket of Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano [70]. Grayscale's CEO hailed the approval as a win for “public market access, regulatory clarity and product innovation.” [71] Other firms from Bitwise to VanEck are racing to update their filings. “Not all of our existing filings qualify,” noted VanEck's Kyle DaCruz, “the next step is to see which products can move forward and how rapidly they get to market.” [72] He predicted “a flood of tokens that many folks have never heard of” coming to ETF menus, compressing years of market education into weeks [73]. The big unknown: investor appetite. Will retail and institutions pour money into a dozen niche crypto ETFs? Or will products for smaller coins struggle to attract volume? That remains to be seen, but the regulatory logjam has clearly broken, opening the door to a new era of crypto financial products.

One of Europe's banking giants, Deutsche Bank, made headlines with a report envisioning Bitcoin on central bank balance sheets by 2030 [74]. The German lender suggested that as Bitcoin matures, central banks may hold it alongside gold as a hedge asset – essentially treating Bitcoin as “digital gold” for reserve purposes [75]. The report pointed to several supporting trends. First, Bitcoin's notorious price volatility has been fading: in August, its 30-day volatility hit historic lows even as BTC reached record prices above $123,500 [76] [77]. This hints that Bitcoin is decoupling from speculative frenzies and behaving more like a stable store of value. Second, institutional interest and inflation hedging are driving adoption. With global inflation lingering and debt levels high, more investors (and some governments) are diversifying into hard assets. Signs of diversification are emerging – China, for instance, cut its U.S. Treasury holdings by $57 billion in 2024, the report noted, implying room for alternatives like crypto [78].

Deutsche Bank does not predict Bitcoin will replace the dollar or become a dominant reserve currency [79]. Rather, they see it coexisting with gold as a complementary reserve asset, especially for countries looking to hedge dollar exposure or financial instability [80]. Neither Bitcoin nor gold is likely to dethrone the dollar, the analysts wrote, as governments will act to protect their monetary sovereignty [81]. But much as gold went from skepticism to staple of central bank vaults, Bitcoin could follow a similar adoption trajectory [82]. Over the next decade, as regulatory frameworks solidify and crypto markets deepen, holding a small portion of reserves in Bitcoin might become conventional for central banks – especially in nations seeking independence from U.S. monetary policy.

Implications: This is a long-term projection, but coming from a major bank it carries weight. If Bitcoin is even partially embraced in official reserves, it would mark a profound integration of crypto into the global financial system. It could also reinforce Bitcoin's narrative as “digital gold,” potentially boosting its valuation and stability (since central banks are ultra-long-term holders). We're already seeing baby steps: El Salvador's central bank holds BTC after making it legal tender, and some sovereign wealth funds reportedly buy crypto. Deutsche Bank's thesis suggests such moves could broaden significantly by 2030. For now, it's speculative – many central bankers still balk at Bitcoin's risks – but the report underlines a growing recognition: crypto is here to stay, and even the most traditional institutions may eventually adapt.

Despite the ups and downs, big money continues to flow into crypto ventures. New York-based VC firm Archetype announced it has raised $100 million for its third fund to back early-stage blockchain startups [83]. Impressively, the fund's backers include pension funds, university endowments, and a sovereign wealth fund – investors once wary of crypto who are now seeking exposure via venture bets [84]. Archetype, led by founder Ash Egan, deliberately kept the fund smaller and more “concentrated” to focus on high-conviction investments, bringing on only one new limited partner in the process [85] [86]. “Running a concentrated $100M fund lets us be extremely selective… we operate with a single goal — to ensure crypto teams are positioned to win,” Egan said [87].

Archetype has a strong track record – it seeded Privy (a crypto wallet startup acquired by Stripe) and US Bitcoin Corp (which merged with miner Hut 8) [88] [89]. The firm now manages ~$350 million, including sizable stakes in major assets like Solana and Ethereum [90]. The new fund has already begun deploying capital into undisclosed deals, targeting projects that can bring crypto to mainstream consumers [91]. Egan noted there's “no silver bullet for mainstream crypto adoption,” but the endgame is to deliver products as seamless as Web2 apps yet better aligned with users and creators [92]. In practice, that means investing in areas like user-friendly wallets, decentralized social platforms, Web3 games, and fintech bridges – anything that can onboard millions without them needing deep crypto knowledge.

This aligns with a broader trend: institutional adoption creeping forward. Recent data shows companies and investment funds (like ETFs) are steadily accumulating Bitcoin, even as early retail adopters take profits [93]. Major asset managers have launched crypto offerings (BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF filing last year was a catalyst), and traditional finance giants are entering DeFi – for instance, JPMorgan's blockchain unit and exchange projects by Nasdaq and others. Each incremental step – venture funding, ETF approvals, positive research from banks – is knitting crypto more tightly into the fabric of mainstream finance. The presence of pension and endowment money in a crypto VC fund like Archetype's is a strong signal: the narrative has shifted from “will crypto survive?” to “how can we profit if it succeeds?”. As Egan put it, the goal now is to make crypto products that everyday users will embrace, often without realizing there's blockchain under the hood [94]. That long-term infrastructure play is well underway, even if the headlines often focus on daily price swings.

In the decentralized finance (DeFi) arena, a noteworthy launch is bridging political and tech worlds. World Liberty Financial (WLF) – a DeFi project with ties to the Trump family – revealed plans for a USD₁ stablecoin ecosystem aimed at everyday payments [95]. At Korea Blockchain Week, WLF co-founder Zak Folkman announced a “very soon” rollout of a crypto debit card and retail app [96]. The USD₁ stablecoin is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, and the new app will merge peer-to-peer transfers with crypto trading features, providing a one-stop mobile wallet [97] [98]. Most notably, the WLF debit card will integrate with Apple Pay, allowing users to spend the USD₁ stablecoin at regular merchants as easily as using a phone tap [99]. This kind of fintech crossover – crypto dollars in your Apple Wallet – is a bid to make stablecoins a daily currency for the masses.

WLF's initiative is ambitious. By partnering with existing payment rails (like Apple Pay and presumably Visa/Mastercard through the debit card), they hope to sidestep one of crypto's biggest hurdles: real-world acceptance. You could pay for groceries or an Uber by debiting your crypto balance, while the merchant gets paid in fiat – all invisible to the user. Similar attempts (e.g. Coinbase's USDC Visa card) have launched before, but WLF is touting a full retail app that also lets users swap and send crypto. The project's political connections add intrigue: being “Trump family-backed,” it's reportedly part of a broader vision to promote an alternative US stablecoin. In fact, Pakistan's government recently mentioned working with World Liberty as it explores bitcoin mining and reserves [100], showing the project's international reach.

DeFi Evolution: Beyond WLF, DeFi innovation continues at a breakneck pace. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are proliferating – for example, Hyperliquid DEX just launched a USDH stablecoin and is drawing volume in a heated battle for traders [101]. Protocols are racing to offer higher yields and novel services (from on-chain asset management to undercollateralized lending). However, regulators are watching closely; the era of “DeFi in the shadows” is ending as projects engage with compliance (or face enforcement). The integration of stablecoins into regulated markets, as championed by the CFTC's move, could greatly benefit DeFi platforms by legitimizing their collateral and expanding liquidity [102] [103]. We're also seeing more real-world assets (RWA) on-chain – everything from tokenized Treasury bills to tokenized real estate shares – to blend traditional finance with DeFi's efficiency. In short, DeFi is gradually shedding its outlaw image and going mainstream, often with cooperation from regulators and TradFi institutions. World Liberty's consumer-friendly stablecoin app is one example of that trend: it aims to make interacting with DeFi-backed money as routine as using a bank app, without users needing to understand the complex smart contracts underneath.

The once red-hot NFT market has cooled significantly in 2025, entering what insiders dub an “NFT winter.” Trading volumes for digital collectibles have collapsed by about 97% from their euphoric peak in early 2022 [104]. Back then, monthly NFT sales topped $17 billion; now it's only a few hundred million [105]. Floor prices of even blue-chip NFT collections (like Bored Apes and CryptoPunks) have fallen 70–90% from all-time highs [106]. The bust has been painful for investors who chased jpegs at sky-high prices. Marketplace leader OpenSea saw activity drop so much that it lost market share and had to cut fees, although it's shown signs of a comeback in early 2025 by adding new features and even teasing its own token launch [107].

Yet, the NFT story is far from over – it's evolving, not dying. The downturn flushed out flippers and forced a focus on real utility. Successful projects now emphasize community, brand partnerships, and tangible benefits rather than speculation. Notably, Pudgy Penguins (a whimsical cartoon penguin NFT line) emerged as a top performer, recording $72 million in sales in Q1 2025 – up 13% year-on-year [108]. They achieved this by expanding beyond art: Pudgy Penguins launched physical merchandise and licensing deals, effectively turning their NFTs into a multimedia brand. Another example: Starbucks. The coffee giant's Odyssey program sold 2,000 NFT “Journey Stamps” (digital membership collectibles) that sold out in minutes, offering customers exclusive perks and experiences [109]. This showed that when framed as loyalty rewards, NFTs can succeed with mainstream consumers who might not even realize they're using crypto tech. Nike, Adidas, and Gucci likewise continue to experiment with NFTs for customer engagement, treating them as long-term brand plays rather than quick-profit assets [110].

Meanwhile, the rise of Web3 gaming and new NFT use cases provides a bright spot. Projects like Parallel (a sci-fi card game) launched NFT collections with novel mechanics (e.g. tiered rarity card packs) that appeal to gamers, not just collectors [111]. And the concept of Bitcoin Ordinals – NFTs inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain – gained traction in 2024, bringing NFT culture to the original crypto network [112]. Magic Eden, a marketplace that embraced Ordinals early, managed to capture the largest share of that emerging market by August 2024 [113]. This cross-pollination of communities hints at a future where NFTs are standard across many chains and platforms, each serving different niches.

The Road Ahead for NFTs: The froth and frenzy have subsided, but a core of dedicated builders and collectors remains. We're seeing an industry reset: projects must demonstrate real value – whether it's art that people truly love, in-game items with utility, or membership tokens that confer VIP access. As one analysis put it, the shakeout is “forcing projects and platforms to prioritize utility, sustainability, and community over mere hype and profit” [114]. Long-term, this maturation is healthy. It's weeding out cash-grabs and funneling energy into NFTs that can revolutionize digital content ownership, music rights, event ticketing, and more. Already, major entertainment companies are exploring NFTs for fan clubs and IP licensing, and startups are working on NFT-based tickets to combat fraud in concerts and sports. If the broader crypto market stabilizes and usability improves (e.g. wallet apps become as easy as using email), NFTs could well have another renaissance – but a more pragmatic, utility-driven one.

In summary, the crypto and blockchain space saw a whirlwind 48 hours of developments on Sept 23–24, 2025, touching every corner of the industry. From markets finding their footing after a pullback, to governments and regulators setting new guardrails, to big institutions and funds doubling down on crypto bets, and innovators pushing DeFi and NFTs into everyday life, it's clear that this ecosystem is both maturing and constantly on the move. “The end game is to deliver products at parity with Web2…better aligned with users,” as investor Ash Egan remarked [115] – and the news of this week shows that vision unfolding. In the short term there will be volatility and debate, but in the long term, the foundations laid now – whether in policy cooperation, technological integration, or institutional adoption – are shaping a future where crypto is more accessible, regulated, and integrated into the global economy than ever before.

Oops, something went wrong

Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, is up over 2,000% in the past five years.

Unrealized Bitcoin gains made up 99% of the company's Q2 2025 net income.

The data analytics software side of the business brought in $115 million in revenue in the latest quarter.

10 stocks we like better than Strategy ›

Many things are possible in the world of cryptocurrencies. You can tokenize non-digital assets and put them on the blockchain. A dog-based memecoin that started as a joke just got its own ETF. And certain noncrypto companies can turn their fortunes around just by adding Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) to their balance sheets.

Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), formerly MicroStrategy, pioneered the idea of Bitcoin corporate treasury companies. It still operates as a software company, but Strategy is now the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world. Chairman Michael Saylor's decision to go all in on Bitcoin back in 2020 means it is cryptocurrency, not software, that drives the company's fortunes.

Strategy's core business is providing data analytics software to improve business intelligence. Its second-quarter earnings report, released in July, shows almost $115 million in software revenue for the three months ended June 30. That's less than 1% of its $14 billion in quarterly net income. The remaining 99% was driven by unrealized Bitcoin gains.

Strategy's share price is up over 2,000% in the past five years, overshadowing Bitcoin's 940% gain by quite some margin. Unlike a spot Bitcoin ETF, Strategy is designed to amplify rather than mirror the top cryptocurrency's gains. It leverages its Bitcoin holdings to borrow money to buy more Bitcoin. For investors, there are a few important indicators to use when analyzing crypto corporate treasury companies. One is to compare the company's market value with what its crypto holdings are worth -- in this case, a market cap of almost $98 billion against crypto holdings of almost $74 billion.

For Strategy, and the 200 or so companies that followed it so wholeheartedly into the crypto lane, a prolonged dip in Bitcoin's price could put pressure on the bottom line. Simply put, it could be hard to service debt and maintain shareholder confidence if Bitcoin falls. For example, Bitcoin's rally meant Strategy could issue more shares without diluting shareholder value, but that could change if prices fall.

Speaking at a Bloomberg Future of Finance event in Frankfurt, Cipollone said the effort to create a digital euro had a “major breakthrough” last week when relevant finance chiefs reached an agreement on how to set customer holding limits, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.

The effort now has momentum, Cipollone said, according to the report.

The European Parliament, whose legislation is required to enable the digital euro, is set to receive a progress report on the initiative on Oct. 24 and could vote on the required legislation by May 2026, Cipollone said, per the report.

It was reported Sunday (Sept. 21) that European Union finance ministers agreed on a roadmap for launching a digital euro backed by the European Central Bank and that their input was considered crucial to assuage fears that a digital currency could lead to a run on traditional bank deposits.

In February, it was reported that the European Central Bank was hoping that progress on legislative approval for a digital euro would be spurred by U.S. President Donald Trump's endorsement of dollar-pegged stablecoins.

The European Commission put forward digital euro legislation in June 2023, but progress had been sluggish.

Cipollone said in the February report that Trump's support for stablecoins tied to the U.S. dollar introduced another American-driven financial tool and increased the urgency to move forward with a digital euro.

In March, it was reported that European Stability Mechanism Managing Director Pierre Gramegna said that Europe's monetary autonomy and financial stability could be threatened by the Trump administration's interest in cryptocurrencies and dollar-denominated stablecoins.

Gramegna said that in light of the change in the U.S. perception of digital currencies, the ESM believed that “this digital euro is today more necessary than ever.”

Cipollone said Sept. 4 that the European Union should accelerate its efforts to introduce a digital euro, in part because this technology would support resilience and inclusiveness.

A digital euro would complement physical cash, which remains essential for resilience and inclusion, and would provide another universally accepted means of payment, Cipollone said.

“In an increasingly digital world exposed to new geopolitical and operational risks, we must protect the euro's availability for all Europeans at all times,” Cipollone said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Digital euro unlikely to launch before 2029, ECB board member says","https://cointelegraph.com/news/digital-euro-mid-2029-fair-assessment-ecb-cipollone","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 10:34:33 GMT","

 Introduced in October 2020, Europe's digital euro may not launch until 2029, according to ECB Executive Board member Piero Cipollone. 

The digital euro, the European Union's long-planned central bank digital currency (CBDC) project, is facing delays, with its launch now expected around mid-2029.

The EU's digital euro could become a reality in 2029, European Central Bank Executive Board member Piero Cipollone said in a Bloomberg Future of Finance event Tuesday in Frankfurt.

“The middle of 2029 could be a fair assessment,” he said, adding that the ECB has been actively discussing the project at the level of EU member states.

If correct, Cipollone's timeline would signal another delay for the digital euro, despite widespread calls to launch the CBDC to protect Europe's financial sovereignty amid the US stablecoin push.

According to Cipollone, the European Parliament has been the biggest obstacle to progress toward a digital euro, as it must pass legislation to move forward with the project.

“We should arrive at a general approach, as they call it, an agreement among member-states by the end of the year,” he said, adding that the Parliament is likely to have a position on a digital euro by May 2026.

Cipollone's assessment on Europe's CBDC launch came soon after EU ministers reached a “compromise” on the digital euro roadmap last week, imposing holding limits on the potential digital currency.

“The compromise that we reached is that before the ECB makes a final decision in relation to issuance [...] there would be an opportunity for a discussion in the Council of Ministers,” Irish Finance Minister and Eurogroup President Paschal Donohoe said at a news conference last Friday.

While Cipollone expects the digital euro won't launch before mid-2029, European authorities are pressing ahead with CBDC preparations, with the ECB targeting October to decide whether to move to the next phase.

A spokesperson for the ECB told Cointelegraph on Wednesday that a member of the European Parliament (MEP) is expected to deliver a progress report on the digital euro on Oct. 24.

Following the report, lawmakers will have six weeks to put forward amendments and a further five months for discussions, Cipollone reportedly said.

Officially introduced by the ECB in October 2020, the digital euro project has emerged as one of Europe's longest-discussed financial initiatives.

In June 2023, the European Commission published a legal proposal for a potential digital euro, yet progress within the European Parliament has remained limited.

Meanwhile, the ECB has steadily advanced the project, completing its investigation phase in November 2023 and moving into a preparation phase set to finish by October 2025.

Despite these steps, the initiative has faced significant skepticism from banks, lawmakers, member states, as well as end users, largely due to concerns around CBDC privacy.

Globally, some central banks have piloted their own digital currencies for years. China, for example, launched a pilot digital yuan wallet in early 2022. However, the digital yuan has encountered slow adoption, with critics describing many CBDCs as costly fiat replicas rather than genuine fintech innovations.

The trend reflects diverse use cases from remittances to gaming, but regulatory uncertainty could limit long-term potential, analysts say

The Asia-Pacific region has become the world's fastest-growing hub for cryptocurrency transactions, with on-chain activity surging despite inconsistent oversight and varied pathways to adoption, according to a new report.

Analysts say the trend reflects not only diverse use cases – from remittances and savings to gaming and speculative trading – but also regulatory uncertainty across the region, which could limit long-term potential even as momentum builds.

The report, released on Wednesday by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, found that during the 12 months ending June 2025, Asia-Pacific had emerged as the fastest-growing region for on-chain crypto activity, with a 69 per cent year-over-year increase in value received.

Total crypto transaction volume in the region grew from US$1.4 trillion to US$2.36 trillion, driven by robust engagement across major markets including India, Vietnam and Pakistan.

Monthly on-chain value received grew from about US$81 billion in July 2022 to peak at US$244 billion in December 2024, a threefold increase over 30 months. Transaction volumes have since remained robust at above US$185 billion per month through mid-2025.

In contrast to North America, where cryptocurrency activity is largely driven by institutional investment, Asia-Pacific's growth is fuelled by broader, more retail-oriented demand, according to Chengyi Ong, head of Asia-Pacific policy at Chainalysis.","{'href': 'https://www.scmp.com', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}","cryptocurrency"

From Washington to Wall Street, a new reality has set in: digital assets and blockchains are no longer fringe experiments. Banks are piloting tokenized deposits and settlement rails. Asset managers are launching digital asset offerings. Policymakers are drafting rules that assume this technology is here to stay. The world is showing up. This is good news, but now comes the hard part. We have to make sure the technology is ready for it.

The next phase of crypto's growth won't revolve around sleek marketing or speculative manias. It will be determined by boring (but measurable) metrics like throughput, finality and cost. Put simply, blockchains must become so efficient and reliable that companies can't resist integrating them into their systems.

This isn't just a technical story for me. I grew up in southern China and came to the United States as a teenager to study math and finance at Carnegie Mellon. Numbers were a source of certainty, of objectivity. Despite my love for research, I balked at the idea of spending years studying for a Ph.D. I wanted to make a big impact possible in a short amount of time, to get my hands dirty. So I went into trading.

On Wall Street, there's nothing subjective about your performance: your PnL speaks for you. That suited me perfectly. I loved the discipline of markets, where even the most elegant theory has to survive contact with reality. But I also saw the limitations of legacy infrastructure. Settlements dragged. Data lived in silos. Every improvement felt like a patch, not a breakthrough. When I discovered crypto in the early days of DeFi (decentralized finance), all kinds of crazy experiments were popping left and right, and it felt like seeing the early internet all over again: a raw but powerful system that could fundamentally rewire finance.

I left traditional finance for DeFi and joined AirSwap, one of the earliest decentralized exchanges. We tried to implement traditional finance systems to blockchain, like order matching between market makers and takers, but then another decentralized exchange called Uniswap launched, and it made the decision of removing market makers altogether (instead, users trade against a so-called liquidity pool).

This was a big ""aha!"" moment for me. Here was a platform that allowed users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies without the help of intermediaries, like a bank or a broker. For the first time, you could trade without a counterparty on this decentralized exchange. The rules of the market were encoded in an open-source software; everyone could check the code out to see how it worked. It was clunky, yes, but it was also something entirely new. And this innovation was only possible because of the way blockchain infrastructure worked.

What else could we do with this infrastructure? The question carried me through my early years in crypto. The decentralized finance ecosystem was still very illiquid, so I decided to build Amber Group, a crypto wealth management firm, to focus on liquidity provision. We managed to grow Amber's AUM to $5 billion at its peak. At Amber, we experimented with Web3 rails, sometimes succeeding, sometimes failing, but always pushing the envelope. Every new blockchain innovation became an opportunity to approach finance in a novel way.

My experience at Amber Group showed me that crypto infrastructure still isn't ready for the level of efficiency that institutions are going to demand. The technology has come a long way, but if banks, asset managers and fintechs are truly going to run on-chain, then the rails need to perform like core financial plumbing. Speed and finality must improve, with latency shrinking toward sub-second interactions. Cost must not only be low but predictable, since enterprises plan around certainty as much as price. Mature rails should be simple (almost boring) at the surface, but elegant underneath it all.

We shouldn't underestimate the benefits that would come from integrating blockchain infrastructure to our financial system. We need to think of it like a hardware upgrade. Switching from phone booths to iPhones didn't just improve call quality; it unlocked entire new ways of living. The same happened when Wall Street shifted from paper tickets to electronic trading. Blockchains, if they perform, can do that again: not just replacing what exists, but enabling what has never been possible.

Through it all, what drives me is not abstract performance metrics but impact. How does this technology change things for you and me? Can it make transactions cheaper and faster? Can it develop completely new markets? Can it give individuals more control over their assets? Can it expand the realm of financial opportunities for ordinary people, inside and outside of the United States?

If we get this right—if we make the rails strong enough for the financial system to run on—then the ripple effects could be felt for decades, all around the globe. Institutional demand is real. Public interest is real. The reputational moment has arrived. It will not be won with rhetoric but with performance. Rails must be fast, cheap, reliable and safe enough to fade into the background.

When the world shows up, you don't need fireworks. You just need the numbers to work.

A strategic partnership with the Hilton Family Office is expected to help Kansas City-based Technology Labs on its mission to protect and educate new investors in the crypto jungle, shared co-founder Travis Wright.

The startup announced Tuesday that Hilton Finance — the lending and investment division of the boutique family office with deep ties to the Hilton Hotel empire — is investing $300,000 into its CoinResearch.ai platform, a cryptocurrency research and investing toolkit using AI-driven insights and tools to empower users to make informed, confident crypto investments.



Hilton's support and strategic reach will enable Technology Labs to accelerate its impact and scale its mission globally, said Wright, co-founder of the startup and host of the Bad Crypto podcast, the second-longest-running crypto podcast.

“It's nice to have somebody see what we've done, believe in it, and then put some more money in as we continue to raise,” he added.

The $300,000 is part of a  $1.3 million fundraising round for Technology Labs and is expected to help with its marketing push.

“Technology Labs is helping define the next frontier of financial research in the AI and blockchain space,” said J. Bradley Hilton, chairman of the Hilton Family Office and grandson of hotel magnate Conrad Hilton, in a news release. “We believe their technology stack is foundational to the future of intelligent investing, and we're excited to be part of this journey.”

Wright — along with CMO Shane Hackett and CTO Eric Fellows — launched CoinResearch in March 2024 after he fell for a honeypot scam — where crypto is put in and can't be taken out — while checking into a potential project, he noted.

“If I'm a guy who's been doing crypto since 2010, I'm pretty sophisticated,” Wright continued. “All these people who are coming into crypto now — what we're calling the ‘E-trade babies,' ‘the Motley Fools,' the Gen X and Boomer investors, who've really have done a lion's share of the investing up to this point — they're going to be bringing their money in and it's not safe. It's a jungle.”

This realization led him to hire several financial researchers to create reports around the best AI projects, he said. Hackett — CMO at Legion Capital and Chairman of the Board at MarketLeverage who made the connections to Hilton Finance — was so impressed by the reports that he encouraged him to turn it into a product.

“We've been working on it now for about 18 months, all self funded,” he added. “Then the Hilton Family Office is like, ‘Hey, we'd like to utilize this information to help us on our new Hilton tech fund.'”

CoinResearch is designed to provide users with in-depth analysis, accurate ratings, and expert recommendations for cryptocurrency investments. Its advanced algorithms analyze vast amounts of data to deliver actionable insights that can help users make informed trading decisions.

“A lot of people in the crypto space will typically raise and have nothing,” Wright said. “They say, ‘Here's what we're gonna do.' Having been in crypto for so long and having paid attention to the crypto markets in the space for so long, I didn't want vaporware. If we're going to raise money, I want us to have something that's legit and built and badass and already working that way. When somebody comes in, they're not just buying hopes and dreams.”

Ripple's prime brokerage, Hidden Road, has expanded its services to enhance institutional crypto trading. The company has partnered with ABEX, a provider of execution algorithms for institutional trading. This partnership integrates ABEX's technology with Ripple's brokerage infrastructure, offering global clients advanced execution tools in digital asset markets.

Hidden Road and ABEX announced their collaboration to provide agency execution capabilities for digital assets. The partnership allows clients to access ABEX's execution algorithms through Ripple's prime brokerage and custody services. These tools are designed to improve precision, reduce costs, and increase transparency in fragmented crypto markets.

Michael Higgins, International CEO at Hidden Road, commented on the partnership. He stated, “ABEX shares our commitment to bringing precision, transparency, and execution quality to digital assets.” Hidden Road aims to provide institutions with sophisticated tools to enhance their trading experience. The collaboration strengthens the company's position in the digital asset space, offering clients an efficient trading infrastructure.

ABEX's technology focuses on improving trading outcomes by optimizing execution strategies. The integration allows Hidden Road clients to trade across multiple venues while maintaining seamless workflow. The collaboration positions Ripple's Hidden Road as a key player in transforming institutional trading in the digital asset sector.

Ripple's acquisition of Hidden Road in April 2025 enabled the payments company to enter the prime brokerage space. The $1.25 billion acquisition marked a significant move for Ripple, allowing it to operate a global, multi-asset prime broker. Hidden Road's infrastructure complements Ripple's blockchain technology, providing a solid foundation for growing institutional interest in digital assets.

The Ripple-Hidden Road partnership supports clients in trading various asset classes, including foreign exchange, digital assets, and fixed income. Ripple's acquisition strengthens the combined firm's offerings, enhancing its competitiveness in the rapidly evolving crypto market. The new service expansions include advanced execution tools and OTC options for institutional clients.

Hidden Road's recent developments include launching OTC options for digital assets in partnership with QCP and BlockTech. These features allow clients to execute options while leveraging cross-margining on their digital holdings. This addition makes Ripple's Hidden Road even more appealing to institutional investors seeking flexible solutions in the digital asset space.

BTC$113,965.34 remains stagnant in the $110,000 to $120,000 range, while gold and U.S. equities hover near all-time highs.

According to Glassnode's Accumulation Trend Score by cohort, selling pressure is evident across all wallet groups. This metric measures the relative strength of accumulation based on the size of entities and the volume of coins acquired over the past 15 days. A value closer to 1 signals accumulation, while a value closer to 0 signals distribution. Exchanges and miners are excluded from this calculation.

Currently, every cohort, from wallets holding less than 1 BTC to whales holding over 10,000 BTC, is in distribution. The largest whales, with holdings above 10,000 BTC, are showing some of the most aggressive levels of selling over the past year.

Looking at long-term holder supply, the percent of circulating supply unmoved for at least 1 year has dropped sharply from 70% to 60%. The peak was in November 2023, when bitcoin traded near $40,000. At the same time, 2+ year holders also began to sell, with their share declining from 57% to 52%.

The three year plus cohort now sits just above 43% and has been steadily falling since November 2024. These wallets largely represent buyers from the previous cycle top in November 2021 at around $69,000, many of whom accumulated more during the 2022 bear market when prices hit lows of $15,500. With bitcoin's recovery, these investors are realizing gains.

By contrast, five year plus holders remain steady, reflecting that the longest-term investors are not participating in the sell-off.

This trend shows that investors sitting on unrealized profits from this cycle are continuing to realize profits, adding to the ongoing selling pressure.

XLM Consolidates After Sharp Decline, Testing Key Support Levels

IREN (IREN), one of the largest self-operated BTC$113,965.34 miners in the U.S., is breaking away from the pack, and Wall Street is taking notice.

Bernstein analysts raised their price target on IREN to $75 from $20, implying about 80% upside, as the miner doubles down on building its own AI cloud business rather than relying on co-location deals with partners like CoreWeave (CRWV).

IREN has already had a major move, ahead more than eight-fold from its 52-week low of $5.13 hit in April. The shares are higher by 365% year-over-year.

The broker now sees IREN's AI pivot as credible, despite early skepticism about the miner's ability to execute on a capital-intensive data center build-out and compete with AI cloud players tied to hyperscalers and Nvidia (NVDA).

IREN is guiding for rapid growth, the report noted, with $500 million in annual recurring revenue by Q1 2026 on 23,300 GPUs, up from roughly $14 million in Q1 2025.

Beyond AI, IREN retains flexibility with its 3 gigawatt (GW) power portfolio, balancing bitcoin mining and AI workloads to maximize revenue per megawatt, Bernstein analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.

Its 50 EH/s mining operation generates an estimated $600 million in annualized EBITDA at current bitcoin prices, funding its AI expansion, according to the analysts.

Bernstein has shifted its valuation approach to a sum-of-parts model, assigning 87% of enterprise value to AI cloud and co-location potential at IREN's 2GW West Texas site, with the remaining 13% coming from bitcoin mining. 

At the revised target, IREN would trade at $7.5 million per megawatt (MW), above other AI-focused miners but still far below established data center peers like CoreWeave, suggesting further room for multiple expansion, the report added.

Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin is being integrated into tokenized money-market funds from BlackRock and VanEck, giving holders of the products a direct redemption path into on-chain liquidity.

Through a new smart contract on Securitize's platform, investors in BlackRock's BUIDL and VanEck's VBILL funds can now swap their shares for RLUSD on demand, creating what Ripple calls a 24/7 stablecoin off-ramp for tokenized treasuries.

The move positions RLUSD as a settlement layer for real-world assets (RWA) while broadening its institutional footprint. 

Jack McDonald, Ripple's SVP of Stablecoins, said in a prepared statement thathe tie-up “is a natural next step as we continue to bridge traditional finance and crypto,” framing RLUSD as regulatory-compliant and enterprise-grade.

RLUSD — backed 1:1 with liquid reserves and issued under a New York DFS trust charter — has climbed past $700 million in circulation since launching last year. Ripple has been pushing its use in cross-border payments and DeFi pools, while now anchoring it to institutional RWA platforms.

The Securitize tie-in also sets up RLUSD for deployment on the XRP Ledger, giving Ripple a dual push of a regulatory-compliant stablecoin issuance on one side, and DeFi-facing usability on the other.

Bitcoin's (BTC) break below key support has prompted a flurry of 'buy the dip' calls on social media. However, liquidity trends suggest a potential for a deeper decline.

BTC has dropped over 3% to $111,590 this week, piercing the widely-tracked 50- and 100-day simple moving averages (SMA). Both indicators have lost their upward momentum for the first time since April, now flatlining to signal caution for bulls.

Meanwhile, mentions of ""buy the dip"" on social media have surged to their highest level in nearly a month, a telltale sign of bullish sentiment among retail investors, according to data tracking platform Santiment. The platform tracks ""buy the dip"" mentions using its social trends indicator, which analyses the volume of relevant keywords and phrases across Reddit, Telegram and X (formerly Twitter).

A spike in these mentions is considered a contrarian signal by Santiment, meaning the ongoing price pullback in BTC could deepen.

""Prices typically move [in] the opposite direction of the crowd's expectations. So if retail traders believe that $112,200 is finally the time to buy, then a little more pain needs to be felt. Once the crowd stops feeling optimistic, and they begin to sell their bags at a loss, this is typically the time to strike with your dip buys,"" Santiment said in a market analysis note.

Analysis of order book liquidity also suggests scope for a continued move lower.

According to Hyblock Capital, the deepest liquidity cluster, marked by concentration of buy/sell orders, is seen at $107,000. The level can act as a magnet, pulling the price down, Hyblock explained on X.

Order book liquidity refers to the concentration and availability of buy and sell orders at different price levels in the order book for a specific asset. It reflects market depth and liquidity by showing the volume available to buy or sell at each price.

Large liquidity levels, such as $107,000, can effectively absorb incoming supply and demand, helping to stabilize prices. Additionally, traders often place buy orders near these levels, anticipating a price bounce, which creates a self-reinforcing support effect.

According to Hyblock, smaller but growing liquidity pools are also seen at $109,000 and $111,000.

 The number of crypto millionaires has jumped 40% year-on-year to over 240,000, driven mainly by institutional adoption, according to Henley & Partners. 

The number of crypto millionaires has risen by 40% year-on-year to 241,700, fueled by Bitcoin's price rally and the broader crypto market valuation pushing past $3.3 trillion by mid-2025, according to a new report.

The number of crypto centimillionaires — people with crypto holdings above $100 million — rose 38% to 450, while the crypto billionaire count jumped 29% to 36 by the end of June, wealth and citizenship advisory firm Henley & Partners said in its Crypto Wealth Report on Tuesday.

“This significant growth coincides with a watershed year for institutional adoption,” Henley said. 

Public companies and major financial firms have increasingly bet on cryptocurrencies, especially in the US, as the Trump administration's crypto-friendly policy actions have given Wall Street confidence to invest, which has helped to boost the market's value.

So far in 2025, inflows into US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have increased from $37.3 billion to $60.6 billion, while spot Ether (ETH) ETF inflows have risen fourfold to $13.4 billion.

Investment advisory firms and hedge fund managers scooped up the most spot ETH ETFs in the second quarter, increasing their holdings to $1.35 billion and $688 million, while brokerage and private equity firms also increased their positions.

Henley said the increased number of crypto millionaires over the year was “fueled by a dramatic surge in Bitcoin millionaires.”

Bitcoin millionaires rose 70% over the year to 145,100, partly due to Bitcoin outperforming the broader market between July 2024 and June 2025.

The Bitcoin centimillionaire count also jumped 63% to 254, while the number of billionaires rose 55% to 17.

Phillipp Baumann, founder of financial research and quantitative asset management firm Z22 Technologies, told Henley that part of the rise could also be attributed to Bitcoin becoming the “base currency for accumulating wealth” for more investors.

Despite the rise, adoption by the total crypto user count only rose 5% to 590 million.

Henley's findings were based on in-house wealth tier models, which used separate modelling to determine the number of crypto millionaires, centimillionaires, and billionaires, along with information from CoinMarketCap, Binance and the Ethereum block explorer Etherscan.

Henley, which advises wealthy clients — including crypto investors — on citizenship and residency, ranked Singapore, Hong Kong, and the US as the top destinations for crypto migration.

Switzerland and the UAE rounded out the top five in the company's Crypto Adoption Index, which factored in public adoption, infrastructure adoption, innovation and technology, regulatory environment, economic factors and tax-friendliness.

However, it noted that smaller countries like Costa Rica, El Salvador, Greece, Latvia, Panama, New Zealand and Uruguay have all developed strategies to attract digital asset investors.

 Strategy chair Michael Saylor says Bitcoin will gain after “macro headwinds” subside as treasury companies and ETFs put upward pressure on the cryptocurrency. 

Bitcoin will start to gain again toward the end of the year, after facing upward pressure from growing corporate and institutional interest, says Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor.

Saylor told CNBC's Closing Bell Overtime on Tuesday that corporate adoption of Bitcoin (BTC), along with the consistent acquisition of Bitcoin by large exchange-traded fund (ETF) funds on behalf of institutional investors, is taking up all the natural supply.

Saylor added that “companies that are capitalizing on Bitcoin are buying even more than the natural supply being created by the miners,” which is “putting upward pressure on the price.”

On average, miners generate roughly 900 Bitcoin per day, according to Bitbo. A report from financial services company River released earlier this month found that businesses are gobbling up 1,755 Bitcoin per day in 2025, while ETFs are snapping up an additional 1,430 per day on average in 2025.

Bitcoin has been drifting between $111,369 and $113,301 over the last 24 hours, while its seven-day range has been moving between $111,658 and $117,851, according to CoinGecko.

Traders were also liquidated out of nearly $2 billion in one of the year's largest market flush-outs on Monday, which analysts blamed on technical factors rather than weakening market fundamentals. 

“I think that as we work through the resistance of late and some macro headwinds, we'll actually see Bitcoin start to move up smartly again toward the end of the year,” Saylor added.

Saylor said that Bitcoin-buying companies can be boiled down to two categories, the first being operating companies that would otherwise be returning their capital via dividends and buybacks, which choose Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.

Bitbo is tracking at least 145 companies that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, including Strategy, which holds 638,985 BTC.

“That actually improves their capital structure. It strengthens those companies. There's a lot of those,” Saylor said.

Saylor said the second type of Bitcoin-buying companies are “true treasury companies” that are “capitalizing on Bitcoin.”

“The world ran on gold-backed credit for 300 years. The world's going to run on digital gold-backed credit for the next 300 years. So treasury companies are holding digital capital and creating digital credit instruments,” he said.

 DefiLlama data showed that Aster topped daily perpetual trading volumes with $24.7 billion on Wednesday, surpassing competitors including Hyperliquid and edgeX. 

Aster, a decentralized perpetuals exchange on BNB Chain, saw open interest surge nearly 33,500% in less than a week, challenging that of its top rival, Hyperliquid.

On Wednesday, CoinGlass data showed that Aster's open interest jumped from $3.72 million on Friday to $1.25 billion at the time of writing. The spike in active contracts signaled that traders were piling into the platform, challenging its biggest competitor, Hyperliquid. 

Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding contracts that haven't been settled. It's used as a key metric to gauge liquidity and market conviction toward a project. Aster's open interest surge showed that the traders are willing to deploy capital on the platform. 

In addition to open interest, Aster's total value locked (TVL), another key indicator in decentralized finance (DeFi), also increased. On Wednesday, DefiLlama data showed that Aster's TVL was at $1.85 billion, a 196% increase from Friday's $625 million. 

DefiLlama data also showed that Aster topped daily perpetual trading volumes on Wednesday, with nearly $24.7 billion in the last 24 hours. 

This put Aster's 24-hour performance above its strongest competitor, Hyperliquid, which only recorded about $10 billion on Wednesday. Players like edgeX and Lighter followed closely, with daily volumes of $8.25 billion and $6.18 billion, respectively. 

While Aster surpassed Hyperliquid's daily volume performance, the decentralized exchange (DEX) still commands deeper liquidity over longer periods. 

Hyperliquid remains on top of the charts when it comes to seven-day and 30-day perpetual volumes. In the past week, Hyperliquid recorded $66 billion and had nearly $300 billion in the last 30 days.

On Friday, a BNB Chain spokesperson told Cointelegraph that Aster had received its support and that of YZi Labs (formerly Binance Labs). This included mentorship, ecosystem exposure and access to technical and marketing resources. 

Crypto data platform CoinMarketCap also boosted Aster through its CMC Launch program, a launchpad that features new projects. 

CMC Launch lead Jin Choo told Cointelegraph that the campaign to support Aster had generated significant exposure. 

This included 400 million homepage banner impressions, over 3 million tweet impressions and a combined reach of over 5 million through newsletters, app notifications and media coverage. 

“The campaign also recorded over 1.5 million views across live events, 1.5 million landing page clicks and more than 500,000 clicks to Aster's project page,” Choo added. 

Binance acquired CoinMarketCap in April 2020 for an undisclosed amount. However, when asked if YZi Labs or Binance had a hand in Aster being chosen for CMC Launch, Choo said no. 

He told Cointelegraph that the project was chosen solely based on its merits, in line with CMC Launch's qualification criteria, which include innovation, market potential, and community traction.

“Binance and CoinMarketCap are separate entities with independent operations,” Choo told Cointelegraph. “Binance has no control or influence over the way CoinMarketCap is managed and operated, including how we conduct project promotions.”

Most of an Earthquake's Energy Is Released as Heat, Not Shaking

Up to 98 percent of the energy of an earthquake goes into flash heating rocks, not shaking the ground, new research shows. The finding could help yield better earthquake forecasts

The shaking produced by an earthquake can crack the ground, bring down buildings and cause massive rockfalls. All this destructive power is, astoundingly, just a fraction of a quake's overall energy.

A new laboratory study in AGU Advances finds that shaking accounts for only 1 to 8 percent of the energy released in an earthquake, while up to a whopping 98 percent of that energy dissipates as heat. The friction of huge rock chunks sliding against one another can spike the temperature of the ground to more than 1,700 degrees Celsius—hot enough to melt quartz and other minerals.

It's challenging to measure how much of an earthquake's energy goes to shaking the ground versus breaking rocks versus flash heating, given that quakes start deep below Earth's surface and happen at unpredictable intervals. To understand this energy budget, Daniel Ortega-Arroyo, now a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and his colleagues created itty-bitty lab earthquakes by pressing centimeter-sized wafers of a powdered granite and magnetic particle mixture between aluminum pistons until the wafers slipped or snapped. They measured this process of cracking under stress with thermometers and piezoelectric sensors that mimic the seismographs used to measure real earthquakes.

Even these centimeter-scale earthquakes got hot fast. “It essentially went from room temperature to above 900 degrees C in a few microseconds—so extremely, extremely fast,” Ortega-Arroyo says.

Between 68 and 98 percent of the energy released in these lab quakes dissipated as heat, the researchers found. The breaking of the wafer took anywhere from less than 1 percent of the energy to as much as 32 percent, whereas the shaking made up 8 percent or less. Samples that had been more deformed before breaking experienced a little less heating, Ortega-Arroyo says, which indicates that the history of the rocks in a fault might control how much energy goes to heating, rock-breaking and shaking in the next quake.

The new research is important because the energy budget of earthquakes is “a huge unknown,” says Rachel Abercrombie, an earthquake researcher at Boston University, who was not involved in the study but discussed the experiments with the authors before publication. “It's pretty fundamental to understanding the earthquakes and therefore being able to model them.” Earthquake computer models are used for everything from determining how quakeproof local buildings should be to trying to figure out when a fault will break next and how big the resulting quake will be.

One advantage of the work is that it used a new technique measures the alignment of magnetic minerals in heated rock to help interpret the temperature change, says Heather Savage, an earthquake researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Savage, who wasn't involved in the study, does field analyses of melted rocks on old fault lines. These real-world studies also use magnetic analysis, she says, and having the same measurements in the real world and in the lab can help scale the findings from a centimeter-sized wafer to a multikilometer-long fault.

“How do I extrapolate this to something like an earthquake on the San Andreas fault?” Savage says. “That's probably a pretty big question for us to mull over.”

We Can Stop Teen Suicide

By understanding warning signs and talking to your child, parents can help reduce the risk of teen suicide

I have a patient named “Alex.” He is 15. He feels alone, down almost every day. He tells me he's having trouble with schoolwork. He worries about his future. He struggles to make friends and keep the ones he has. He says it's hard to get out of bed, to shower and brush his teeth. He doesn't find joy in things he used to love, like painting. I met him in our emergency department; he was in the middle of a crisis and came to us for help.

Alex has depression and anxiety, and these feelings had been going on for about one year. Recently, he told me he'd been thinking about hurting himself or overdosing on medication. These thoughts were becoming more frequent. He talked a lot about wanting to die.

The teenage years are difficult. Our kids carry huge emotional burdens, and more youths than ever face anxiety, depression or have trouble regulating their emotions. Unfortunately, suicide is now the second leading cause of death in youth ages 10 to 24. Among this age group, suicide rates have risen more than 60 percent in the last 20 years. Chronic physical health issues, abuse or other traumatic events, substance use, bullying or negative experiences with social media, family history or past history of contemplating or attempting suicide are huge risk factors.

I've sat beside far too many children who've told me they don't want to live anymore. Some whisper it. Others say it with tears streaming down their cheeks. It doesn't have to come to this. And parents are key to prevention.

So why was I, a child psychiatrist, particularly concerned about Alex? He initially had a hard time opening up and minimized concerns his family had about him. His parents knew something was off but attributed it to teenage angst until the changes became more pronounced. His struggles and the progression of his symptoms were seriously concerning. We needed to act.

There are many things that I and others think has led to the rise in suicide risk. Our teens constantly question their self-worth, struggle to cope with distressing situations, or feel disconnected and unvalidated. Family, school and community can make these feelings worse, and the risks worsen alongside other mental or physical health problems.

Getting Alex treatment, establishing a clear safety plan, limiting access to things that could pose harm (like medications or firearms), finding friends and family to build a support network, and making sure he was getting support at school, home and within the community would be important in reducing his risk. But this goes for all children at increased risk of suicide.

Having a child at risk can be scary and uncertain. Even if everything looks okay on the outside, it may not be. It's the last thing any parent ever expects to hear. But you're in a powerful position. You can protect your child by knowing what leads to suicide, picking up on warning signs and getting help.

You are not alone in this. There is hope. Your child can get through it. Here's how:

Warning signs vary, and some are less obvious than others. Alex complained that he was tired on school days, that he had a stomachache and didn't want to eat. Of course, these can be symptoms of physical health concerns or, if brief and transient, they may be related to typical teenage behavior. When it's vague, persistent, impairing, however, and there is no clear medical cause, it could very well be a symptom of anxiety, depression, chronic stress or general emotional distress.

Recognizing when your child is acting differently and uncharacteristically may be a subtle sign that there is something wrong. For you, here's the opportunity to be curious and check in. “I noticed you have been having more bellyaches before school; I wonder if there is something about school or something else that is bothering you. I am here to listen and want to understand how I can help.” Acting early can help reduce overall risk.

But there are some warning signs that are more obvious: Making statements about wanting to die or not be around, expressing intense guilt or shame, saying things like they feel like a constant burden to family or others, are all red flags. Others include talking about feeling empty, trapped or hopeless; or isolating themselves, or like Alex, no longer doing activities they enjoyed. Mood matters too. Some children are irritable, sad or constantly worried. Others talk about unbearable emotional or physical pain. You might see significant changes in eating or sleep patterns, and involvement in risky and uncharacteristic behaviors, including substance use.

Alex told his primary care doctor and his family how high his risk had gotten; he told his family how trapped he felt. A mental health screen affirmed concerns about worsening depression, anxiety and more frequent thoughts about hurting himself. The emergency visit confirmed he was in crisis.

More and more experts are recommending suicide risk prevention and screening, and your child's primary care doctor, their school, mental health providers and the emergency department at your local hospital are all crucial partners. This screening is often shared in a confidential way on a handout or tablet, is brief, and reviewed by a health care professional. Sometimes the screen can be done verbally.

Kids often won't tell you how they are feeling until you ask them directly. Sometimes they bury their emotions or conceal their thoughts, and asking them directly frees them to share their burdens. The direct ask, as well as the screening tool, is how we identify risk even if your child is at the doctor for something else entirely—an ear infection or a broken bone. Even if your child screens negative, the questions are an important opportunity to check in on your child's emotional health, provide education, and to have a conversation.

What happens if risk becomes urgent? Call or text 988, a national crisis line. You may have a local number or website for crisis management. Trust your instincts—if something feels off, act.

At home, secure anything your child could use to hurt themselves, like guns, sharp objects, medication. Even items like pencil sharpeners, fishing hooks, scissors or paper clips may be a hazard to some youth at higher risk for self-injury or suicide. The only downside of being “too” careful is letting your child know you care about them, which isn't a downside at all. Create a safety plan that includes coping strategies when emotions are high and safe spaces and emergency contacts. These contacts can include parents, other family, other trusting adults at school or in the community. Keep handy what resources exist when the risk of self-harm or suicide increases.

When you can, ask your kid directly: “Have you ever felt so sad you didn't want to be here?” and “Have you thought about hurting or killing yourself?” These questions don't put ideas in their head—they show you care. Let your child know you love them and appreciate their honesty and courage.

Try to get them to a mental health provider as soon as is feasible and work with your local school and primary care office to keep your child safe. If there is a long wait, try your school or primary care office, as well as your local community mental health office and crisis services. They may have ways to expedite access to care or can provide bridging services and support until that care is available. Many states also have telepsychiatry programs where your local primary care office, emergency department or school can access child psychiatry and psychology expertise. If there is worsening or more serious concerns about suicide or self-harm, take them to the emergency department or other appropriate crisis service in your community.

While all of this may be daunting and the stress can be unimaginable, don't forget to take care of you. The National Alliance on Mental Illness can help. Being a teen is just really hard. Remember that your child's struggles do not make you a failure as a parent—being present, responsive, empathic and seeking help to keep them safe is a tremendous gift you can offer a teen who is at risk.

Alex's family saw his quiet sadness, his mood and that he wasn't doing the things he used to enjoy. After opening up to his parents and the emergency department mental health team, he said he felt empty in addition to feeling trapped. He told them how he had trouble making friends, how his difficulties academically were affecting him, and that he had had thoughts of killing himself. He told me that he felt immediate relief from admitting how bad things were. Although Alex indicated he had thoughts of killing himself, he said he had no desire or intent to act on these thoughts. He wanted help.

Alex worked with me, his care team and his parents to create a safety plan, got quick follow-up care and started psychotherapy within a week. He later started on medication to address his depression and anxiety. Within several weeks, his mood improved, old activities started to bring joy again, and after six months, he was thriving and painting again.

Every time I hear from a patient that they wish they weren't alive, I feel the weight of their pain. I want to help. Staying connected, listening, acting on warning signs and using the resources around you that are here to help keep your child safe is how you can make an immense difference.

With the right support, most young people with suicidal thoughts recover and go on to lead fulfilling, happy lives. I've seen families come closer together through tough times. One conversation, one act of love, one connection at a time; this is how we—and you—save lives.

IF YOU NEED HELP

If you or someone you know is struggling or having thoughts of suicide, help is available. Call or text the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or use the online Lifeline Chat.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

One of the hardest things about exploring the quantum world is that many of the phenomena in this “invisible” realm occur at mind-bogglingly small scales.

Take, for example, what is known as the quantum Hall effect. First discovered in 1980 by German physicist Klaus von Klitzing, this effect describes the behavior of electrons (under the influence of a magnetic field and approaching absolute zero temperatures) as they pass through 2D materials, such as graphene. Usually, you'd expect the electrons to experience resistance and scatter, but under these conditions, they formed lossless energy states locked along the material's boundary. 

This quantization of electrical resistance, known as an “edge state,” is particularly useful if you want to create exotic materials free of electrical resistance. But there's just one problem. 

“These states occur over femtoseconds, and across fractions of a nanometer, which is incredibly difficult to capture,” Richard Fletcher, an assistant professor at MIT, said in a press statement. A femtosecond is one quadrillionth of a second. “The beauty is seeing with your own eyes physics which is absolutely incredible but usually hidden away in materials and unable to be viewed directly.”

To actually study this quantum interaction on a more reasonable scale, Fletcher—along with his colleagues at MIT's Research Laboratory of Electronics and the MIT-Harvard Center for Ultracold Atoms—decided on a novel method to essentially scale up this phenomenon using a cloud of ultracold sodium atoms instead of electrons. 

According to the researchers, this allowed the team to watch these edge states form “over milliseconds and microns,” which are much more manageable experimental parameters. The results of the study were published in the journal Nature Physics.

To create this quantum interaction on a bigger scale took a large amount of experimental ingenuity. The team used one million ultracold sodium atoms and essentially trapped them in a complex set-up of lasers. However, to simulate the experience of living in a flat space, the researchers also spun them like “riders on an amusement park Gravitron.”

“The trap is trying to pull the atoms inward, but there's centrifugal force that tries to pull them outward,” Fletcher said. “The two forces balance each other, so if you're an atom, you think you're living in a flat space, even though your world is spinning. There's also a third force, the Coriolis effect, such that if they try to move in a line, they get deflected. So these massive atoms now behave as if they were electrons living in a magnetic field.”

Scientists then defined the “edge” of this gaseous material by introducing a laser, which formed a wall around the atoms. Once atoms encountered this light, they flowed in just one direction—much like electrons at ultra-small quantum scales. 

“You can imagine these are like marbles that you've spun up really fast in a bowl, and they just keep going around and around the rim of the bowl,” Martin Zwierlein, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “There is no friction. There is no slowing down, and no atoms leaking or scattering into the rest of the system. There is just beautiful, coherent flow.”

To test these atoms' resistances, the team then placed obstacles—such as a point of light—in their paths, and the atoms passed by without any measurable resistance. 

Now that scientists have a reliable stand-in for this quantum process, future experiments can push these interactions to the “edge” and begin to explore unknown frontiers of this fascinating piece of quantum physics.

The University of Aberdeen student was working on a dig in Scotland when she found the relic that could be a rare discovery from the Pictish Kingdom.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

There's nothing quite as educational for an archaeology student as making a rare discovery while working on a dig. That's the story of University of Aberdeen student Jodie Allan, who volunteered on a dig in Scotland's East Lomond and found what is likely a rare carving depicting the face of a Pict resident. 

Allan initially believed she had simply found a hunk of slag when working through soil at the major hillfort settlement in Fife, but a closer look revealed that the “hunk of slag” was actually far more than a random piece of metal. “I had no idea I was holding anything significant,” Allan said, according to a university statement. “But I took a closer look because of its size and because of the color—a sort of oxidized coppery green—caught my eye.” 

After revealing the find to her professor, Gordon Noble of the Falkland Stewardship Trust, the true nature of the find quickly became clear. “I showed it to Professor Noble who took one look at the stone, and his reaction told me it was something special,” Allan said, “with what appears to be a carved face on it.” 

The carving, which easily fits in Allan's hand, may depict the face of someone from the southernmost portion of the Pictish kingdom, known to rule much of what has become modern-day Scotland. “This is an early schematic carving with two eyes, a nose, and what appears to be a hairline at the top,” Noble said. “We need to get this fully analyzed but it appears to be a carving of a face and resembles some of the human faces you see in early medieval manuscripts.” 

Noble said that the human face was not commonly recreated during this time, making the find quite rare. “We'll have to look at all the parallels, but if it really is a human face, it's nice to think it could be a rudimentary portrait of a local Picts who lived at East Lomond,” he said. 

Estimates place the carving's origin between the fifth and seventh centuries C.E. Every new find in East Lomond , including Allan's, continues to support the belief that the site was crucial in the Pictish kingdom. “Everything points to this being a wealthy settlement connected to the wider world,” said Joe Fitzpatrick from the Falkland Stewardship Trust, “and we are finding a good number of complete objects within the context of stone and turf buildings, which is unusual for the Pictish period.” 

Allan's find—along with others that may still be on site—could provide additional clues into life at the kingdom. “The discovery could offer new insights into how Picts understood themselves and represented their own identities through crafting and stone carving,” Noble said. “The face suggests that Pictish people here were making more expedient carvings, perhaps something for family members living at the site rather than public display like the more famous Pictish symbol stones.” 

Archaeologists will continue to put the face in perspective as they radiocarbon date the find and the layer around it. “East Lomond is turning out to be such an amazing site,” Noble said. “In addition to the face, we found a complete mattock head, an iron tool from the floor of a building right next to the building with the carving, and from other parts of the site fragments of weaponry and other rare objects are beginning to illuminate the development of this settlement from the late Roman Iron Age through to around the seventh century [C.E.].”

When children are exposed to acetaminophen -- also known by the brand name Tylenol or as paracetamol -- during pregnancy, they may be more likely to develop neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including autism and ADHD, according to a new study.

The study was published recently in BMC Environmental Health. Andrea Baccarelli, dean of the faculty at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and professor of environmental health, was senior author. The study was led by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and also included co-authors from other institutions.

The researchers analyzed results from 46 previous studies worldwide that investigated the potential link between prenatal acetaminophen use and subsequent NDDs in children. The researchers used the Navigation Guide Systematic Review methodology -- a gold-standard framework for synthesizing and evaluating environmental health data -- which enabled them to conduct a rigorous, comprehensive analysis that supported evidence of an association between acetaminophen exposure during pregnancy and increased incidence of NDDs.

The researchers noted that while steps should be taken to limit acetaminophen use, the drug is important for treating pain and fever during pregnancy, which can also harm the developing fetus. High fever can raise the risk of neural tube defects and preterm birth. ""We recommend judicious acetaminophen use -- lowest effective dose, shortest duration -- under medical guidance, tailored to individual risk-benefit assessments, rather than a broad limitation,"" they wrote.

In late September, the Food and Drug Administration announced it would issue a letter to clinicians urging them to be cautious about the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy. Baccarelli said he had discussed his study with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the weeks leading up to that announcement and provided the White House team with an statement noting his research found ""evidence of an association"" between prenatal exposure to acetaminophen and neurodevelopmental disorders. ""That association is strongest when acetaminophen is taken for four weeks or longer,"" Baccarelli said.

The statement continued: ""Further research is needed to confirm the association and determine causality, but based on existing evidence, I believe that caution about acetaminophen use during pregnancy -- especially heavy or prolonged use -- is warranted.""

Baccarelli noted in the ""competing interests"" section of the research paper that he has served as an expert witness for plaintiffs in a case involving potential links between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders.

The study was conducted in collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles; University of Massachusetts Lowell; and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

Funding for this study was provided by the National Cancer Institute (U54CA267776), the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (R35ES031688), and the National Institute on Aging (U01AG088684).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This forgotten king united England long before 1066","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250924012246.htm","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:13:13 GMT","

A groundbreaking new biography of Æthelstan marks 1,100 years since his coronation in 925 AD, reasserts his right to be called the first king of England, explains why he isn't better known and highlights his many overlooked achievements. The book's author, Professor David Woodman, is campaigning for greater public recognition of Æthelstan's creation of England in 927 AD.

The Battle of Hastings in 1066 and the signing of Magna Carta in 1215 are two of the most famous years in English history. But very few people know what happened in 925 or 927AD. Professor David Woodman, the University of Cambridge-based author of The First King of England, a groundbreaking new biography of Æthelstan, is determined to change this and not just with his book. He - and other historians - are planning a fitting memorial for England's first and unfairly overlooked king.

""As we approach the anniversaries of Æthelstan's coronation in 925 and the birth of England itself in 927, I would like his name to become much better known. He really deserves that,"" says Woodman, a Professor at Robinson College and Cambridge's Faculty of History.

Woodman is working with other historians* towards a memorial for the king, which could be a statue, plaque or portrait in a location like Westminster, Eamont Bridge (where Æthelstan's authority in 927 was recognized by other British rulers) or Malmesbury (where he was buried). Woodman is also calling for the history of Æthelstan's reign to appear more routinely on the school curriculum.

""There has been so much focus on 1066, the moment when England was conquered. It's about time we thought about its formation, and the person who brought it together in the first place,"" Professor Woodman says.

Why isn't Æthelstan better known?

Woodman's book, published by Princeton University Press, blames a lack of public relations. ""Æthelstan didn't have a biographer writing up his story,"" Woodman says. ""His grandfather, Alfred the Great, had the Welsh cleric Asser to sing his praises. And within decades of Æthelstan's death, a wave of propaganda ensured King Edgar became famous for reforming the church. This completely overshadowed Æthelstan's earlier revamping of learning and religiosity.""

In modern times, historians have tended to dismiss Æthelstan's status as England's first king, on the basis that the kingdom fragmented soon after his death in 939AD. The focus has instead shifted to Edgar. Woodman rejects this argument.

""Just because things broke down after Æthelstan's death doesn't mean that he didn't create England in the first place,"" Woodman says. ""He was so ahead of his time in his political thinking, and his actions in bringing together the English kingdom were so hard-won, that it would have been more surprising if the kingdom had stayed together. We need to recognise that his legacy, his ways of governing and legislating, continued to shape kingship for generations afterwards.""

Woodman cites a wealth of evidence to resurrect Æthelstan's reputation.

Military success

""Militarily, Æthelstan was supremely strong,"" Woodman says. ""He had to be very robust to expand the kingdom and then to defend it.""

Æthelstan had to contend with major Viking settlement in the north and the east. In 927AD, he acquired authority over the Viking stronghold at York, and, in bringing Northumbria within his dominion, became the first to rule over an area recognizable as 'England'.

As Æthelstan expanded his kingdom, he drew Welsh and Scottish kings into his royal assemblies. Large-scale surviving original diplomas, housed in the British Library, list the very many nobles he compelled to attend. The meetings of Æthelstan's assemblies must have been incredibly grand affairs, involving hundreds of people in total.

""These Welsh and Scottish kings must have bitterly resented being brought so far out of their territories,"" Woodman says. ""An incredible tenth-century Welsh poem, The Great Prophecy of Britain, calls for the English to be slaughtered. It's difficult to date, but it may be a direct response to this expansion of Æthelstan's power.""

Then, in 937AD, at the famous Battle of Brunanburh, Æthelstan brutally crushed a formidable Viking coalition, supported by Scots and the Strathclyde Welsh, determined to overthrow him.

""Brunanburh should be as well-known as the Battle of Hastings,"" Woodman says. ""Every major chronicle, in England, Wales, Ireland and Scandinavia took note of this battle, its outcome and how many people were slaughtered. It was a critically important episode in the history of the newly-formed English kingdom.""

Numerous locations have been proposed for the battle. Woodman is confident that it happened at what is now Bromborough on the Wirral. ""That location makes sense strategically and the etymology of the name fits,"" he says.

Revolution of government

Æthelstan's most powerful legacy rests in his ""revolution of government,"" Woodman suggests. Legal documents from Æthelstan's reign survive in relative abundance and, Woodman argues, take us right to the heart of the type of king he was.

""King Alfred must have been a role model for his grandson,"" Woodman says. ""Æthelstan saw that a king should legislate and he really did. He took crime very seriously.""

Once Æthelstan had created the English kingdom, royal documents known as 'diplomas' (in essence a grant of land by the king to a beneficiary) were suddenly transformed. Formerly short and straightforward, they were transformed into grandiose statements of royal power.

""They're written in a much more professional script and in amazingly learned Latin, full of literary devices like rhyme, alliteration, chiasmus,"" Woodman says. ""They were designed to show off, he's trumpeting his success.""

But Woodman also argues that government became increasingly efficient during Æthelstan's reign. ""We can see him sending law codes out to different parts of the kingdom, and then reports coming back to him about what was working and what changes needed to be made.""

""There is also some of the clearest evidence we have for centralized oversight of the production of royal documents, with one royal scribe put in charge of their production. No matter where the king and the royal assembly traveled, the royal scribe went too.""

Woodman points out that Æthelstan brought England together just as parts of continental Europe were fragmenting. ""Nobles across Europe were rising up and taking territory for themselves,"" he says. ""Æthelstan made sure that he was well placed to take advantage of the unfolding of European politics by marrying a number of his half-sisters into continental ruling houses.""

Learning and religion

Woodman argues that Æthelstan reversed a decline in learning brought by the Vikings and their destruction of churches. ""Æthelstan was intellectually curious and scholars from all over Europe came to his court,"" Woodman says. ""He sponsored learning and was a keen supporter of the church.""

Two of Woodman's favorite pieces of evidence relate to Saint Cuthbert. The first, the earliest surviving manuscript portrait of any English monarch, appears in a 10th-century manuscript now cared for by The Parker Library at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Æthelstan's head is bowed as he stands before the saint. ""Everyone should know about this portrait, it's one of the most important images in English history,"" says Woodman.

The manuscript was originally designed as a gift for the Community of Saint Cuthbert. ""Æthelstan had just expanded into Northumbria and this manuscript cleverly includes a life of Saint Cuthbert,"" Woodman says. ""He was trying to win them over to his cause.""

Woodman felt even closer to Æthelstan while studying the Durham Liber Vitae. Begun in the ninth century, this manuscript chronologically lists the people who had a special connection to the Community of Saint Cuthbert, in alternating gold and silver lettering.

""If Æthelstan is going to appear, he should be many pages in, but in the tenth century someone visited Saint Cuthbert's Community and wrote 'Æthelstan Rex' right at the top. Seeing that was breathtakingly exciting. It's feasible that someone in his entourage was responsible. We know they visited the Community in 934 and this manuscript may have been on prominent display there, perhaps on its high altar.""

Metrics details

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are highly effective in haematological malignancies1. However, progressive loss of CAR T cells contributes to relapse in many patients2,3,4. Here we performed in vivo loss-of-function CRISPR screens in CAR T cells targeting B cell maturation antigen to investigate genes that influence CAR T cell persistence and function in a human multiple myeloma model. We tracked the expansion and persistence of CRISPR library-edited T cells in vitro and at early and late time points in vivo to track the performance of gene-modified CAR T cells from manufacturing to survival in tumours. The screens revealed context-specific regulators of CAR T cell expansion and persistence. Ablation of RASA2 and SOCS1 enhanced T cell expansion in vitro, whereas loss of PTPN2, ZC3H12A and RC3H1 conferred early growth advantages to CAR T cells in vivo. Notably, we identified cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (encoded by CDKN1B), a cell cycle regulator, as the most important factor limiting CAR T cell fitness at late time points in vivo. CDKN1B ablation increased CAR T cell proliferation and effector function, significantly enhancing tumour clearance and overall survival. Our findings reveal differing effects of gene perturbation on CAR T cells over time and in different environments, highlight CDKN1B as a promising target to generate highly effective CAR T cells for multiple myeloma and underscore the potential of in vivo screening for identifying genes to enhance CAR T cell efficacy.

Robertsonian chromosomes are a type of variant chromosome that is commonly found in nature. Present in 1 in 800 humans, these chromosomes can underlie infertility, trisomies and increased cancer incidence1,2,3,4,5. They have been recognized cytogenetically for more than a century6, yet their origins have remained unknown. Here we describe complete assemblies of three human Robertsonian chromosomes. We identified a common breakpoint in SST1, a macrosatellite DNA located on chromosomes 13, 14 and 21, which commonly undergo Robertsonian translocation. SST1 is contained within a larger shared homology domain7 that is inverted on chromosome 14, which enables a meiotic crossover event that fuses the long arms of two chromosomes. Robertsonian chromosomes have two centromeric DNA arrays and have lost all ribosomal DNA. In two cases, we find that only one of the two centromeric arrays is active. In the third case, both arrays can be active but owing to their proximity, they are often encompassed by a single outer kinetochore. Thus a combination of array proximity and epigenetic changes in centromeres facilitates the stable propagation of Robertsonian chromosomes. Investigation of the assembled genomes of chimpanzee and bonobo highlights that the inversion on chromosome 14 is unique to the human genome. Resolving the structural and epigenetic features of human Robertsonian chromosomes at a molecular level provides a foundation for a broader understanding of the molecular mechanisms of structural variation and chromosome evolution.

Robertsonian chromosomes (ROBs) are structurally variant chromosomes created by the fusion of two telocentric or acrocentric chromosomes to make a single metacentric chromosome. First recognized in 1916 by Robertson in grasshopper karyotypes6, these fusions are a common occurrence in nature, having since been recognized in many branches of life including plants, vertebrates and invertebrates. Robertsonian fusions (or translocations) are the most common karyotypic change in mammals8. ROBs create challenges for meiosis, potentially leading to subfertility, reproductive isolation and speciation9,10. Human ROB carriers are often asymptomatic, but ROBs contribute to trisomies such as Down and Patau syndromes5 and are associated with increased rates of certain cancers4 and uniparental disomy11. Despite their frequent occurrence and important effects on fertility, speciation and human health, the underlying mechanisms and evolutionary origins that explain why these chromosomes form so frequently in nature remain unknown.

In humans, ROBs occur in 1 out of 800 births1,2,3, most commonly in female meiosis12,13. The most common ROBs are the fusion of acrocentric chromosome 14 with chromosome 13 or chromosome 21, which are suspected to form by a similar specific mechanism14. In these fusions, the long arms of the chromosomes are joined and parts of the short arms are lost. ROBs can occur de novo or be inherited15. A population-level analysis7 of the recent complete assembly of the human genome (CHM13)16, which includes the short arms of the acrocentric chromosomes, revealed megabase-sized homology blocks called pseudo-homologue regions (PHRs) that are shared between acrocentric chromosomes. The existence of PHRs implies frequent interhomologue recombination and a working model for how ROBs form17.

Here we fully assemble three common ROBs: two chromosome 13–chromosome 14 (13;14) fusions and one 14;21 fusion. In all three cases, the ROBs have two centromere arrays, have lost all ribosomal 45S DNA repeats and are fused near a macrosatellite array composed of SST1 repeats. The repeats are named for the restriction enzyme that cuts them, isolated from the eponymous Streptomyces stanford. We demonstrate that the SST1 arrays on ribosomal DNA (rDNA)-containing chromosomes (also known as NBL2)18 bear hallmarks of exchange between chromosomes, including enrichment for PRDM9 DNA binding motifs that are associated with recombination hotspot activity19. Further analysis of SST1 repeats and segmental duplications in human and nonhuman primate genomes suggests that SST1 may have a broader role in genome rearrangements and evolution beyond Robertsonian fusions. Additionally, analysis of the two centromeric arrays on each ROB indicates epigenetic adaptations to support stable mitotic transmission, consistent with previous observations20,21. In conclusion, we provide, to our knowledge, the first complete assemblies of common ROBs, precise mapping of their fusion sites, and insight into their formation and transmission mechanisms.

A working model for the formation of common ROBs postulated that they occur owing to: (1) sequence homology between nonhomologous chromosomes, provided by the PHRs; (2) proximity of the PHRs, provided by co-location of rDNA arrays from different chromosomes in the nucleolus; (3) recombination initiation in meiosis to form a crossover; and (4) an inversion on chromosome 14 (refs. 7,17,22) (Fig. 1a). The asymmetric structure and chromosome-unique features around the SST1 arrays suggested that we would be able to map the translocation site (Fig. 1b). To further test this working model, we sequenced and assembled the complete, telomere-to-telomere sequence of three ROBs.

Bottom, synteny plots comparing the assembled ROB to the CHM13 genome sequence. The structure of each fused region is shown in detail. a.u., arbitrary units.

We selected three independent cell lines for sequencing and assembly, each harbouring a unique ROB: (1) GM03417 (45 or 46,XX,t(14;21); clinical features of Down syndrome); (2) GM04890 (45,XX, t(13;14); clinically normal with five miscarriages); and (3) GM03786 (45,XX,t(13;14); clinically normal). The fusions were initially confirmed in mitotic spreads using chromosome-specific paints (Fig. 1c–e). We generated Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Hi-C, Illumina and PacBio HiFi sequencing data (Supplementary Table 1). The Verkko assembler utilized ONT, PacBio and Hi-C data to generate complete de novo assemblies of the ROBs23. Each ROB was visible in the assembly graph by a node connecting regions representing two different acrocentric chromosomes (Extended Data Figs. 1–3). Notably, these connecting nodes skipped the rDNA arrays, consistent with the working model and supporting the loss of rDNA in the common ROBs.

We assessed the quality of the assemblies (see Methods), finding high Phred quality scores (quality values) ranging from 49.10 to 54.70, corresponding to approximately 99.999% accuracy, and high gene completeness, with all assemblies containing over 98% of benchmarking universal single-copy orthologues24 (BUSCOs) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Read coverage analysis across the breakpoint regions shows consistent coverage without significant drops or high-frequency secondary alleles, confirming the structural accuracy of the assembled fusion points (Supplementary Fig. 2). Hi-C data, which capture the three-dimensional organization of chromosomes, showed increased interactions between the q arms of each ROB, emphasizing the physical proximity of these regions due to the fusion (Supplementary Fig. 3), which was also observed by microscopy in nuclei (Extended Data Fig. 4).

SST1 macrosatellite arrays are present on several chromosomes25. Multiple subfamilies of SST1 arrays exist. One subfamily occurs in the PHRs of chromosomes 13, 14 and 21, whose population genetic and structural features have led to the hypothesis that they are the site of recombination in recurrent Robertsonian fusions7. Using cytogenetics, we probed centromeres of chromosomes 13 and 21 (cen13/21), cen14/22 and SST1 and 45S rDNA arrays. Cen13/21 and cen14/22 are highly similar at the sequence level and cannot be distinguished by conventional fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes. Our analysis confirmed that all three ROBs are missing 45S rDNA arrays and that the SST1 signal is present between centromeric arrays (Extended Data Fig. 4), consistent with the working model for the formation of common ROBs and the assembly graphs. Karyotypic analysis of GM03417 indicates cellular heterogeneity with regard to the number of copies of chromosome 21, with 3 copies of chromosome 21 being relatively rare (around 10%) (Extended Data Fig. 4). Notably, the normal copy of chromosome 14 in GM03786 has lost the SST1 array (Extended Data Figs. 2 and 4), suggesting that polymorphisms in this region exist. Analysis of 26 contigs from the human pangenome that extend beyond the SST1 array have a deletion in 9 out of 26 haplotypes (Extended Data Fig. 5).

To visualize the assemblies, we created synteny plots (Fig. 1c–e) using NGenomeSyn26. SST1 arrays are present on chromosomes 13, 14 and 21, but are inverted on chromosome 14 relative to chromosomes 13 and 21 in many genomes7. Owing to this inversion, when this region of chromosome 14 pairs with a 13 or 21 partner chromosome in meiosis, a crossover event is predicted to join the two long arms, forming a ROB. When we compared the assembled ROBs to their component chromosomes in the CHM13 genome, we observed that the sequence order and directionality were syntenic on either side of the SST1 region. This pattern is consistent with crossover within the SST1 array generating each of the assembled ROBs. Sequence asymmetry in PHRs on chromosomes 13 and 21 versus chromosome 14, which includes a partial SST1 monomer, allowed us to identify that the SST1 array was the breakpoint (Extended Data Fig. 6). We speculate that haplotypes of chromosome 14 that are missing this region would form ROBs less readily.

To better understand the evolutionary relationships and potential exchange between SST1 arrays, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of SST1 monomers derived from the HG002 and CHM13 genomes. The analysis revealed three distinct subfamilies. Subfamily 1 (sf1), also known as NBL2, consists of monomers primarily derived from large arrays on the acrocentric chromosomes and forms a single branch in the phylogenetic tree. Subfamily 2 (sf2) comprises monomers mainly from autosomal arrays (for example, chromosomes 4, 17 and 19) and forms chromosome-specific branches. Subfamily 3 (sf3), also referred to as TTY2, is composed of monomers primarily originating from arrays on the Y chromosome. This classification of subfamilies and their distinct characteristics are illustrated in Fig. 2a,c and Extended Data Fig. 6. The Y-derived repeats co-cluster with a few SST1 monomers from autosomes (see more below). The co-clustering of sf1 monomers from the large arrays on the acrocentric chromosomes due to their high sequence identity (approximately 99% compared with around 90% for sf2 and 75% for sf3) is consistent with frequent recombinational exchange between these repeats, leading to concerted evolution of their constituent monomers.

a, All SST1 monomers from previous analysis of CHM137 and from HG002 were collected and phylogenetic analysis was performed using the maximum-likelihood method based on the best-fit substitution model (Kimura two-parameter + G, parameter = 5.5047) inferred by Jmodeltest2 with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Bootstrap values higher than 75 are indicated at the base of each node. The colour indicates the source chromosome and the shape indicates the source genome. Three major subfamilies were identified: sf1, primarily on the acrocentrics (Acros); sf2, primarily on the remaining autosomes; and sf3, primarily on the Y chromosome. Black arrows indicate the location on the phylogenetic trees of sf2 monomers S and L from the acrocentric chromosomes (Fig. 1b). b, Predicted PRDM9 DNA binding site frequency (mean sites per kb, each dot indicates one haplotype) in SST1 arrays in n haploid genomes are plotted by chromosome. ANOVA analysis with the two-sided Tukey–Kramer test for pairwise mean comparisons. c, Schematic representation of the three subfamilies of SST1. SST1-sf1 has a central gap and a predicted PRDM9 DNA binding site (red box). d, A segmental duplication of 27 kb or larger was identified on several autosomes in CHM13 that includes Y-like α-satellite DNA (α-sat) and SST1-sf3. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the maximum-likelihood method and general time reversible (GTR)-plus-gamma substitution parameters. Bootstrap values are shown. e, Comparison of overlaps between segmental duplications (SDs; ≥10 kb) and random regions or SST1 monomers across 147 genomes. Distributions show the number of overlaps versus density. A permutation test with 10,000 iterations per genome was used to generate random region overlaps. The significant difference between distributions (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, paired, two-sided) indicates non-random association between segmental duplications and SST1 regions.

The recurrent involvement of the SST1 array in ROB formation shown here and the concerted evolution of SST1 arrays on chromosomes 13, 14 and 21 (ref. 7) suggest that this array may comprise a meiotic recombination hotspot. To investigate this, we focused on PRDM9, a key protein in meiosis that has a crucial role in defining recombination hotspots. PRDM9 contains a variable number of zinc-fingers that allow it to bind to specific DNA sequences. Additionally, it possesses a histone methyltransferase domain that trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) and lysine 36 (H3K36)27,28. This trimethylation of H3K4 and H3K36 by PRDM9 creates an open chromatin environment that favours recombination events during meiosis19. Previous work suggested that SST1 arrays on chromosomes 13, 14 and 21 in the CHM13 genome contain predicted PRDM9 binding sites7. To further examine PRDM9 binding sites within SST1 arrays, we searched for the 13-bp PRDM9 DNA binding motif29 of the common A allele30 in the SST1 arrays in 147 human genomes (Methods). The density of PRDM9 DNA binding motifs is significantly higher in the SST1 arrays on chromosomes 13, 14 and 21 relative to chromosomes 4, 17, 18 and Y (Fig. 2b). Whereas previous analysis used a collection of PRDM9 binding motifs to identify sites across acrocentric p-arms7, our current analysis uses only the high-confidence 13-bp PRDM9 DNA binding motif, which appears at a lower frequency in rDNA arrays.

PRDM9 activity leads to the erosion of its own binding sites19. PRDM9 sites in SST1 arrays should erode on all three acrocentric chromosomes. We speculate that PRDM9 sites within the SST1 arrays can regenerate via intrachromosomal or interchromosomal exchange events. However, the inversion on chromosome 14 may create a barrier for interchromosomal gene conversion, tipping the relative balance of erosion and regeneration toward erosion and resulting in the observed lower density of sites on this chromosome. The significantly higher density of PRDM9 DNA binding motifs in SST1 arrays on acrocentric chromosomes aligns with our finding that the consensus sequence of their monomers contains a predicted PRDM9 DNA binding motif (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 7). These findings suggest that the predominant subfamily of SST1 repeats on acrocentric chromosomes (sf1) creates a sequence context that is permissive to meiotic recombination.

Nearly 100 PRDM9 alleles have been identified across human populations30. Some differ by a single nucleotide; others vary substantially by copy number and organization of their zinc-finger motifs. PRDM9 alleles can influence the activity of meiotic recombination hotspots. We reasoned that PRDM9 allele variation could influence the likelihood of ROB formation, so we examined the genotype of our three ROB cell lines. GM3417 is A/A, GM3786 is A/L24 and GM4890 is L24/L9. A is the most common allele, but L24 and L9 are rare, being present in only 1.66% of individuals in the previous study (12 out of 720), although these alleles are overrepresented in an ethnically southern European population30 (9 out of 109). No conclusions can be drawn regarding PRDM9 alleles and ROB formation at this time, as we lack information on vertical transmission and do not have enough samples to test for an association.

Further evidence for SST1-mediated interchromosomal recombination comes from two key observations. First, the phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of Y-like SST1 monomers (sf3) on multiple autosomes (7, 9, 12, 17 and 20). These monomers are contained within larger sequence blocks ranging in size from 25–50 kb with 95–99% identity that also include Y-like α-satellite DNA (Fig. 2d). This pattern suggests that these blocks originated from the Y chromosome, although we could not identify syntenic blocks on the human Y chromosome. Second, we examined the association between SST1 arrays and segmentally duplicated regions, defined as regions longer than 10 kb with at least 90% identity at two or more locations in the genome. Segmental duplications arise and persist via recombination facilitated by repetitive DNA shared between chromosomes. To quantify the association between sf1, sf2 and segmental duplications, we conducted a permutation test with 10,000 iterations in 147 genomes (Methods). The results suggest that the observed association between SST1 and segmental duplications is unlikely to occur by random chance, and the association is highest with sf1 (Fig. 2e). Together, these findings suggest that, beyond its role in recurrent Robertsonian translocations, SST1 may be associated with interchromosomal recombination throughout the genome.

Tandem arrays of the SST1 macrosatellite are not unique to humans; they also exist in nonhuman primate genomes, including several recently assembled telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genomes31. In gibbon, SST1 arrays have been suggested to be responsible for evolutionary patterns of genome instability. As chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) are the most closely related species to humans, we examined the acrocentric chromosomes in their genomes32 for the position and orientation of rDNA and SST1 arrays to understand the potential for ROB formation, specifically, and chromosome evolution more generally. Two out of five rDNA array-positive acrocentric p arms in the bonobo genome (hsa14 and hsa22) and all five rDNA array-positive acrocentric p arms in the chimpanzee genome (hsa13, hsa14, hsa18, hsa21 and hsa22) have co-oriented SST1 arrays (Fig. 3a). The location of SST1 arrays on these chromosomes was validated by FISH (Supplementary Fig. 4).

a, Ideograms of all the rDNA array-bearing chromosomes in human, chimpanzee and bonobo, annotated with the human numbering system (indicated by Hsa prefix). The directionality of 45S rRNA gene arrays (grey) and SST1 arrays (coloured bars) are indicated with arrowheads. b, Predicted PRDM9 binding sites were identified in the chimpanzee genome, and the number of sites per kb is plotted for SST1 arrays for the indicated subfamily. Random regions of the genome (randBins and randGC (GC-matched random regions)) were used to determine background. c, All SST1 monomers from the chimpanzee genome were subjected to phylogenetic analysis using the maximum-likelihood method. The colour indicates the source chromosome. The SST1 monomers from Hsa13, Hsa14, Hsa18, Hsa21 and Hsa22 chromosomes form a single branch, indicating a high degree of similarity. d, All SST1 monomers from the bonobo genome were subjected to phylogenetic analysis using the maximum-likelihood method. The SST1 monomers from chromosomes 14 and 22 form a single branch, indicating a high degree of similarity. e, SST1 monomers from human (Hs), chimpanzee (Pt) and bonobo (Pp) were subjected to phylogenetic analysis using the maximum-likelihood method. The three subfamilies are apparent.

To investigate the potential role of PRDM9 in SST1-mediated recombination, we examined the frequency of predicted PRDM9 DNA binding sites33,34 in SST1 repeats in the chimpanzee genome. The density is high on the rDNA array-positive chromosomes but lower on the other chromosomes (Fig. 3b). Of note, although the SST1 arrays on hsa15 in the chimpanzee genome are composed of sf1 monomers, these monomers are not enriched for predicted PRDM9 DNA binding sites. This is consistent with the monophyletic state of SST1 monomers from hsa15 in chimpanzees and bonobos (Fig. 3c,d). Hsa15 does not have an rDNA array, and its resident SST1 appears not to recombine with SST1 monomers on other chromosomes with rDNA arrays. Together, our findings suggest that further analysis of SST1 and rDNA arrays will provide insight into the recombination and evolution of karyotypes in primate genomes.

To probe the evolutionary history of SST1 arrays and their potential role in chromosomal rearrangements across closely related species, we conducted a comparative phylogenetic analysis of SST1 monomers from rDNA array-positive chromosomes in chimpanzee and bonobo. The analysis revealed patterns similar to the human genome. In the chimpanzee genome, monomers from Hsa13, Hsa14, Hsa18, Hsa21 and Hsa22 co-cluster, whereas in the bonobo genome, monomers from Hsa14 and Hsa22 co-cluster (Fig. 3c,d). These findings provide evidence for interchromosomal exchange between SST1 monomers on rDNA array-positive chromosomes in both chimpanzee and bonobo genomes, suggesting that this phenomenon is not unique to humans but is a shared feature among great apes. When we performed a combined phylogenetic analysis of monomers from chimpanzee, human and bonobo, we observed that the acrocentric chromosomes from all three species contain SST1-sf1 monomers (Fig. 3e). The sf3 monomers from the Y chromosome also co-cluster. Monomers from other parts of the genome form a separate branch for sf2.

The inverted orientation of the SST1 array on the p arm of chromosome Hsa15 in both chimpanzee and bonobo genomes resembles the configuration of the SST1 array on chromosome 14 in the human genome (Fig. 3a). However, the SST1 monomers from Hsa15 form a chromosome-specific branch in the phylogenetic trees (Fig. 3c–e), indicating a lack of recombination between SST1 monomers on Hsa15 and other chromosomes in the ape genomes. This observation correlates with the absence of rDNA on Hsa15 in the chimpanzee and bonobo, which we speculate brings the SST1-containing regions in proximity to the nucleolus, facilitating interchromosomal exchange. Consequently, the chimpanzee and bonobo genomes lack the specific placement and orientation of rDNA and SST1 arrays that we hypothesize facilitate the formation of human ROBs, suggesting that this structural arrangement is unique to the human genome. Correspondingly, the presence of the rDNA and absence of SST1 on human chromosome 15 suggest that the ancestral Hsa15 of human, chimpanzee and bonobo had both rDNA32 and SST1 arrays. The greater sequence divergence of chromosome 15 from other rDNA array-positive chromosomes in humans highlights the importance of SST1 for maintaining their sequence similarity7.

The association between SST1 and interchromosomal recombination events is further supported by the identification of regions that are syntenic with the segmental duplication shown in Fig. 2d across several nonhuman primate genomes (Supplementary Fig. 5a). This finding suggests that these duplication events occurred in a common ancestor. Moreover, we identified a second segmental duplication on chromosome 16 in primates (hsa16), which exhibits a different structure but also contains Y-like SST1 and α-satellite sequences derived from cenY of the common ancestor of apes and New World monkeys (Supplementary Fig. 5b). These findings provide compelling evidence that SST1 is associated with interchromosomal recombination in primate genomes and that past events have involved the Y chromosome as a donor. Notably, the ancestral version of the Y chromosome was likely to contain rDNA35.

All ROBs examined in this study have two centromeric DNA arrays, roughly 5 Mb apart, yet they are faithfully transmitted through mitosis. This observation, consistent with previous cytogenetic observations21, suggests that epigenetic alterations to the centromeres might occur to enable correct chromosome transmission. To investigate centromere activity in ROBs, we leveraged both microscopy and genomic data. To analyse ROBs by microscopy, we performed immunolabelling with FISH (immunoFISH) using FISH probes targeting cen13/21 and cen14/22, along with antibodies against CENP-C, an inner kinetochore protein that marks the active centromere, and CENP-B, which binds to the 17-bp CENP-B box present in α-satellite DNA except on cenY. CENP-B was present broadly across α-satellite DNA, consistent with previous reports for a dicentric chromosome36. Confocal fluorescence microscopy (Supplementary Fig. 6) revealed that the CENP-B signal was proportional to the size of the centromeric array determined by the assembly (Supplementary Fig. 7).

To gain more detailed insights into centromere activity in ROBs, we used structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and single-particle averaging (Methods) to evaluate the localization of CENP-C in the two t(13;14) fusion chromosomes, as it provides higher resolution than confocal microscopy. CENP-C signal was confined to cen14 (Fig. 4a,b), suggesting that cen14 is the active centromere, whereas cen13 is inactive. This observation is consistent with a previous study that found cen14 to be the active centromeric array in most 13;14 dicentrics21. The active array did not depend strictly on size, as in GM04890 cen14 was smaller than cen13 (Supplementary Fig. 7). By contrast, the CENP-C signal for the t(14;21) fusion was less binary. CENP-C signal overlapped with both cen14 and cen21 within a single chromosome (Fig. 4c), and the pattern exhibited heterogeneity between chromosomes, suggesting that both arrays may remain active. Similar to CENP-C, two CENP-A signals were sometimes detected on the t(14;21) ROB (Extended Data Fig. 8). Imaging of NDC80 revealed that these two signals were often encompassed within a single outer kinetochore signal (Extended Data Fig. 8), indicating only one attachment site for microtubules, which would help prevent erroneous attachments.

a–c, ImmunoFISH, DNA methylation and CENP-A CUT&Tag analyses were performed for GM03786 (a), GM04890 (b) and GM03417 (c). Left, representative SIM images of ROBs labelled by immunoFISH with centromeric satellite probes for cen14/22 (orange), cen13/21 (green) and CENP-C antibody (red). DNA was counterstained with DAPI. Bottom images, magnified views depicting single CENP-C foci on cen14 in GM03786 (a) and GM04890 (b), and double CENP-C foci on cen21 and cen14 in GM03417 (c). Scale bars, 1 µm. Bottom left, averaged intensity profiles of lines drawn through the individual kinetochore regions of sister chromatids of multiple ROBs. GM03786: n = 22 (11 chromosomes) (a). GM04890: n = 26 (13 chromosomes) (b); GM03417: n = 24 (12 chromosomes) (c). Intensity profiles were aligned to the peak of the Gaussian of the cen14 signal and normalized to the maximum intensity of each channel. Error bars denote s.d. Top centre and right, corresponding heat maps of sequence similarity calculated for 5-kb bins for each centromere. Below the heat maps, DNA methylation tracks show methylation calls from ONT (orange) or PacBio HiFi (turquoise) sequencing, with hypomethylated regions suggesting active centromere localization. Active centromere regions are indicated by CENP-A enrichment on CUT&RUN (blue) and CUT&Tag (black) tracks.

To further investigate centromere activity in ROBs, we examined epigenetic markers that were associated with active centromeres. Previous studies have identified a dip in CpG methylation in active centromere arrays that coincides with enrichment for CENP-A, the centromere histone H3 variant. This region is referred to as the centromere dip region (CDR) and probably marks the site of kinetochore assembly37,38. We inspected CpG methylation from both HiFi and ONT reads across the centromere arrays in the three assembled ROBs. As controls, we examined CDRs in chromosomes 13, 14 and 21 from the normal chromosomes in the same cell line. We visualized CDRs in conjunction with pairwise sequence similarity heat maps between 5-kb bins of the centromeric array39 and methylation, CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag data for CENP-A. In the t(13;14) ROBs, there is a CDR on cen14, coincident with CENP-A enrichment, and although there is low CENP-A enrichment in the adjacent cen13 array, there is no corresponding CDR (Fig. 4a,b and Extended Data Fig. 9). This finding is consistent with the CENP-C signal being confined to the region with the signal from the cen14 FISH probe, suggesting that cen14 is the active centromere and that this chromosome is functionally monocentric. By contrast, cen13 on the normal chromosome has a clear CDR and CENP-A enrichment (Extended Data Fig. 10). Sequence similarity between centromeres 13/21 and 14/22 are a challenge for mapping short read data from CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag, but have less effect on CDR identification from long read data or imaging.

In the t(14;21) ROB, we observed a dip in methylation in both cen14 and cen21 arrays, located near the adjacent edges of the two arrays (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 9) towards the fusion breakpoint. The CENP-A enrichment is stronger on cen14, but CENP-A enrichment also exists on cen21, coincident with a CDR. In combination with imaging, the data suggest that inner kinetochore proteins are located at both centromeres. The CDR and CENP-A enrichment on cen21 on the normal chromosome are more pronounced (Extended Data Fig. 10). A previous study showed that isodicentric X chromosomes can be stably transmitted through mitosis when centromeres are less than 12 Mb apart20. Our findings suggest that ROBs are stably propagated owing to epigenetic adaptation in centromere activity. In some cases, this is achieved by complete inactivation of one array, whereas in other cases, activity is shared between two arrays that are physically close enough to be encompassed by the outer kinetochore.

Whereas 15% of human ROBs appear to form by idiosyncratic mechanisms, 85% involve chromosome 14 (ref. 14). These common ROBs are likely to arise owing to a unique combination of factors, including the inversion on chromosome 14, the presence of a rDNA array which draws the acrocentric short arms into physical proximity near nucleoli, and recombination initiation from a hotspot at or near the SST1 array. Tandem arrays of SST1-sf1 are found primarily on rDNA array-bearing chromosomes in chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla and human genomes32. However, the assembled chimpanzee and bonobo genomes do not possess a chromosome containing both an inverted SST1 array and an rDNA array, suggesting that this particular structural arrangement is unique to the human lineage. Despite this, phylogenetic evidence suggests that interchromosomal exchange between SST1 arrays on rDNA-containing chromosomes is a common feature in human, bonobo and chimpanzee genomes. Furthermore, the SST1-sf1 arrays that show evidence of exchange in the human and chimpanzee genomes are also enriched for PRDM9 DNA binding sites. Together, the evidence suggests that the common ROBs in humans occur via a combination of four key factors: (1) large regions of homology on heterologous chromosomes; (2) an inversion on chromosome 14, which creates a unique structural arrangement; (3) the co-location of two of these regions in 3D space due to the presence of rDNA arrays that bring the regions into close proximity (within the nucleolus); and (4) meiotic recombination hotspots in SST1, potentially mediated by PRDM9, that lead to crossing over between the nonhomologous chromosomes17.

Our work consolidates many disparate observations regarding the SST1 macrosatellite family, efforts that have been limited by gaps in repetitive DNAs in reference genomes. Through careful analysis of multiple human, chimpanzee and bonobo genomes, we identified three distinct subfamilies of SST1. Several names for these subfamilies appear in the literature, including TTY2 for sf3 on the Y chromosome, MER22 for sf2 and NBL2 for sf1 on the acrocentric chromosomes. In several cases, SST1 sequence has been associated with genome instability and adverse health effects. For example, loss of SST1 repeats on the Y chromosome is associated with male infertility40, and hypomethylation is associated with cancer41,42, potentially contributing to its transcription and subsequent genomic instability43,44. Additionally, meiotic genes such as PRDM9 are often expressed in cancer45, and translocations in cancer often involve acrocentric chromosomes46. Our work is consistent with previous proposals that SST1 contributes to genome instability, and it may have a much broader role than previously appreciated.

SST1-sf1 sequences on the acrocentric chromosomes are highly enriched for PRDM9 DNA binding sites, further implicating this shared macrosatellite DNA as a candidate for meiotic recombination hotspots that would result in recombination between heterologous chromosomes and the formation of common ROBs. We speculate that PRDM9 DNA binding sites that are lost via erosion19 may be ‘regenerated' by gene conversion or other exchange events, allowing SST1-hotspot associated activity to persist and self-sustain. It is possible that rare and functionally distinct PRDM9 alleles contribute to the incidence of ROB formation and segmental duplications, based on their binding properties, but more studies will be required. Together, the evidence suggests SST1 repeats have a substantial role in the stability and evolution of primate chromosomes, as first suggested for the gibbon genome31.

ROBs form more commonly in female meiosis12,13. Meiosis is sexually dimorphic in many ways that could contribute to the higher frequency of ROB formation in female meiosis compared with male meiosis. Female meiosis proceeds through the earliest stages of prophase with DNA in a more demethylated state than in male meiosis47, and open chromatin is more prone to recombination. Consistently, there is more recombination initiation and crossing over in female meiosis48,49,50. Furthermore, hotspots can be sexually dimorphic51. Chromosomes synapse later in female meiosis than in male meiosis49, which could make them less constrained and allow more interchromosomal exchange. Paradoxically, crossovers are suppressed at rDNA arrays in plants52 and yeast53, but the SST1 arrays implicated here may be sufficiently far from the rDNA to avoid any protective effect. Future efforts will be required to distinguish the transcriptional, epigenetic and hotspot status of the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes in developmental and disease states in males and females, and the factors that allow ROBs to occur more commonly in female meiosis.

ROBs are transmitted at a higher rate than Mendelian ratios in female meiosis, a phenomenon known as meiotic drive54. Drive can occur in females because of the segregation of material into ‘dead end' polar bodies, potentially owing to weaker centromeres. The specific structure of each ROB, including centromere activity, may affect its transmission. In our study, the t(14;21) ROB appeared functionally dicentric for inner kinetochore proteins with a spanning outer kinetochore, which may create a stronger centromere, potentially influencing its transmission. Moreover, ROBs have two long q arms, so crossovers on the ROB are more likely relative to an individual acrocentric chromosome, potentially facilitating ROB segregation at M1. The structure of each ROB will differ based on variation in individual centromeres and other repeats, potentially conferring differential transmission. Analysis of many ROBs will be required to understand how individual features affect their propagation and carrier fertility. By integrating insights from genomic, cytogenetic and evolutionary studies, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the role of rDNA and SST1-based recombination in genome evolution and reproductive biology.

Human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) GM03786, GM04890 and GM03417 were obtained from Coriell. All LCL cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) with l-glutamine supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2.

The ultra-high molecular weight DNA was extracted from frozen cell pellets using the NEB Monarch HMW DNA Extraction Kit for Tissue and assessed for fragment size using a pulsed field gel. The fragments span from 50 kb to 1,000 kb in size. Genomic DNA libraries were prepared using the NEB_5ml_Ultra-Long Sequencing Kit (SQK-ULK001)-promethion protocol from Oxford Nanopore. Each library was loaded onto a FLO-PRO002 flow cell and ran for 72 h with two subsequent loadings at 24-h intervals. The libraries were sequenced on a PromethION (Oxford Nanopore) running MinKNOW software v.22.12.5. Basecalling and modified base detection (5mC) were performed on-instrument using Guppy 6.4.6 with the following model: dna_r9.4.1_450bps_modbases_5mc_cg_hac_prom.cfg.

PacBio library preparation was conducted using the SMRTBELL Prep Kit 3.0. The prepared libraries were quantified and sequenced on a PacBio Revio system with Instrument Control Software v.12.0.0.183503 and chemistry v.12.0.0.172289. Sequencing was performed using two SMRT Cells, each with a movie length of 24 h.

Using Pacific Biosciences SMRTbell Prep Kit 3.0 with binding kit 102-739-100 and sequencing kit 102-118-800, three libraries (one per sample). The Megarupter (Diagenode) was used for shearing and SageELF (Sage Science) was used for size selection. Library size was assessed using a FemtoPulse (Agilent). Each library was run on v.25M SMRT Cells using the first generation polymerase and chemistry v.1 (P1-C1). Sequencing was performed on a PacBio Revio system running instrument control software v.12.0.0.183503 and a movie collection time of 24 h per SMRTCell. Using PacBio SMRTLink v.12.0.0.172289, CCS/HiFi reads generated on-instrument using ccs v.7.0.0, lima v.2.7.1 (demultiplexing), and primrose v.1.4.0 (5mC calling).

Hi-C libraries were generated according to manufacturer's directions using the Arima High Coverage Hi-C User Guide for Mammalian Cell Lines (A160161 v.01) and Arima-HiC+ User Guide for Library Preparation Using the Arima Library Prep Module (A160432 v.01). Starting with 5 million cells per sample, the Standard Input Crosslinking protocol was followed, resulting in 1.49–1.86 μg of DNA available per sample to generate large proximally ligated DNA as assessed using the Qubit Fluorometer (Life Technologies). Library preparation was performed using the S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris) to shear samples to 550 bp followed by a DNA purification bead cleanup with no size selection, and 5 or 7 cycles of library PCR amplification per sample. Resulting short fragment libraries were checked for quality and quantity using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and Qubit Fluorometer (Life Technologies). Libraries were pooled, requantified and sequenced as 150 bp paired reads on both the Illumina NextSeq 2000 and NextSeq 500 instruments to obtain at least 600 M read pairs per sample, using real-time analysis and instrument software versions current at the time of processing. Demultiplexing was performed with bcl-convert v.3.10.5. The cut sites (^) for the enzymes used were ^GATC, G^ANTC, C^TNAG and T^TAA.

Libraries were generated from 100 ng genomic DNA using Covaris LE220 plus to shear the DNA and the 2S Plus DNA Library Kit (Integrated DNA Technologies 10009878) for library preparation. To minimize coverage bias, only four cycles of PCR amplification were used. The median insert sizes were approximately 300 bp. Libraries were tagged with unique dual index DNA barcodes to allow pooling of libraries and minimize the impact of barcode hopping. Libraries were pooled for sequencing on the NovaSeq X plus (Illumina) across 14 lanes to obtain at least 369 million 151-base read pairs per individual library.

PCR-free libraries were generated from 1 μg genomic DNA using a Covaris R230 to shear the DNA and the TruSeq DNA PCR-Free HT Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) for library preparation. The median insert sizes were approximately 400 bp. Libraries were tagged with unique dual index DNA barcodes to allow pooling of libraries and minimize the impact of barcode hopping. Libraries were pooled for sequencing on the NovaSeq X plus (Illumina) across 7 lanes on 25B flowcells to obtain at least 388 million 151-base read pairs per individual library.

Phased genome assemblies were generated using Verkko (v.1.4.1)23. The assembly process integrated PacBio HiFi reads and Oxford Nanopore (ONT) reads, with Hi-C reads used specifically for the phasing. The ONT reads included ultra-long reads, defined as reads that are at least 100 kb in length. Verkko was run with the command:

Haplotype-consistent contigs and scaffolds were automatically extracted from the labelled Verkko graph, with unresolved gap sizes estimated directly from the graph structure. After the assembly was generated, we collapsed all nodes composed of only rDNA k-mers into a single node and added telomere nodes to the graph to indicate ends of chromosomes using the commands:


seqtk hpc rDNA.fasta > rDNA_compressed.fasta
seqtk telo assembly.fasta > assembly.telomere.bed
mash sketch -i 8-hicPipeline/unitigs.hpc.fasta -o compressed.sketch.msh
$mash screen compressed.sketch.msh rDNA_compressed.fasta | awk '{if ($1 > 0.9 & & $4 < 0.05) print $NF}' > target.screennodes.out
python remove_nodes_add_telomere.py -r target.screennodes.out -t assembly.telomere.bed


In this simplified graph, the Robertsonian translocation was apparent in all cases (Extended Data Figs. 1–3). We extracted the assembly path corresponding to the ROB and identified gaps in the assembly. There was one gap in GM03417, one gap in GM03786 and two gaps in GM04890. Manual interventions were used to complete the chromosomes.

We evaluated the quality and gene completeness of the genome assemblies using two approaches: a k-mer-based, reference-free method and a gene content assessment. For the k-mer-based evaluation, we employed Merqury55, a tool that assesses assembly completeness and accuracy without relying on a reference genome. Merqury uses k-mer frequencies from sequencing reads to estimate the quality value of the assemblies, which represents the phred-scaled error rate. For our evaluation, we used PacBio HiFi reads for the quality value estimation.

To assess gene completeness, we used compleasm56, a tool based on BUSCO. Compleasm evaluates the presence and integrity of a curated set of BUSCOs expected to be present in the genomes of the taxonomic group under study. We used the primate-specific BUSCO dataset, which includes 13,780 genes, to quantify the completeness, duplication and fragmentation of conserved genes in our assemblies.

In 147 human haploid genomes (from 72 diploid individuals plus the haploid CHM13 and diploid HG002 genomes), predicted PRDM9 DNA binding sites were identified by using Motifence (v.0.1.1, commit fb1ebc0; https://github.com/AndreaGuarracino/motifence) to find DNA sequences matching the canonical 13-mer motif CCNCCNTNNCCNC57 or its reverse complement. To compute the density of PRDM9 DNA binding sites per kb in SST1 regions, SST1 arrays were first identified using TideHunter58. For a region to be defined as an SST1 array, the following criteria were applied: monomeric unit within the array had to be at least 500 bp in length, there had to be at least two monomers, and the monomers had to overlap with RepeatMasker (v.4.1.5, http://repeatmasker.org/) SST1 annotations. The PRDM9 density was then calculated by dividing the number of PRDM9 binding sites in the SST1 regions by the total length of these SST1 regions. PRDM9 alleles were found by conducting a BLAST search (blast-plus/2.13.0) on GM3417, GM3786 and GM4890 with the A allele as the reference. To identify genotypes, these hits were aligned to the 69 alleles from Alleva et al.30 using MUSCLE and visualized in Geneious Prime 2024.0.7.

In the chimpanzee genome, PRDM9 site density in sites per kb on SST1 regions was calculated using R and Bioconductor. The function vmatchPattern from the Biostrings library was used to map the occurrence of the chimpanzee PRDM9 motifs: prdm9_E CNNCCNAANAA, prdm9_W CNGNNAANANTT and prdm9_pt1 ANTTNNATCNTCC, or their reverse compliments, on the genome. SST1-containing regions were then queried for overlap of PRDM9 sites using the countOverlaps function from the GenomicRanges library. Query width was used to calculate sites per kb. SST1 regions larger than 10 kb were broken into 3-kb tiles to approximate resolution near SST1 feature size. Background PRDM9 site density was assessed in two ways. Random background PRDM9 density for each chromosome was determined using 100 randomly chosen 3-kb segments. To account for GC bias, the genome was scored for GC content at 3 kb resolution, and fragments within one s.d. of the average GC content of the SST1-containing elements were chosen to calculate background PRDM9 site density.

To examine associations between SST1 repeats and segmental duplications, we performed the following analysis in 147 human genomes (from 72 diploid individuals plus the haploid CHM13 and diploid HG002 genomes). First, repetitive regions in the genomic sequences were masked using RepeatMasker (v.4.1.5, http://repeatmasker.org/) and Tandem Repeats Finder (v.4.09.1)59. Segmental duplications were then identified using SEDEF (v.1.1)60 on each haploid masked genome. SST1 repeats were detected using RepeatMasker and refined with TideHunter, as described above. Finally, we used the R package regioneR (v.1.36.0)61 to perform permutation testing (n = 10,000) to assess the significance of spatial associations between SST1 repeats and segmental duplications. This analysis was conducted on 147 haplotype-resolved genomes to provide a comprehensive view of these genomic features across diverse human genomes.

We used RepeatMasker to find the regions. We retrieved all fasta files with 1 kb of flanking regions for all arrays. Then, we manually curated all clusters using visual inspection by generating dot plots with the Dotlet applet62 with a 15 bp word size and 60% similarity cut-off. We made regressive changes in the consensus sequences used and that enabled us to describe the sequences properly. By manual curation, we were able to identify the beginning and end of the arrays and each monomer regarding the consensus generated. All monomeric sequences analysed were characterized with the same initial and final point regarding the consensus for the sake of alignment.

We aligned all SST1 full-length monomeric sequences retrieved from assembled genomes using MUSCLE63. We conducted the phylogenetic analysis by using the maximum-likelihood method based on the best-fit substitution model (Kimura two-parameter + G, parameter = 5.5047) inferred by Jmodeltest2 with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Bootstrap values higher than 75 are indicated at the base of each node.

For the preparation of chromosome spreads, cells were blocked in mitosis by the addition of Karyomax colcemid solution (0.1 µg ml−1, Life Technologies) for 6–7 h. Adherent fibroblast cells were collected by trypsinization. Collected cells were incubated in hypotonic 0.4% KCl solution for 12 min and pre-fixed by addition of methanol:acetic acid (3:1) fixative solution (1% total volume). Pre-fixed cells were spun down and then fixed in methanol:acetic acid (3:1).

For SST1 and centromere FISH, spreads were dropped on a glass slide and incubated at 65 °C overnight. Before hybridization, slides were treated with 0.1 mg ml−1 RNAse A (Qiagen) in 2× SSC for 45 min at 37 °C and dehydrated in a 70%, 80% and 100% ethanol series for 2 min each. Slides were denatured in 70% deionized formamide/2× SSC solution pre-heated to 72 °C for 1.5 min. Denaturation was stopped by immersing slides in 70%, 80% and 100% ethanol series chilled to −20 °C. Labelled DNA probes were denatured separately in a hybridization buffer by heating to 80 °C for 10 min before applying to denatured slides. Fluorescently labelled human centromere probes for D13Z1/D21Z1 and D14Z1/D22Z1 were from Cytocell. The biotin-labelled BAC probe for SST1 (RP11-614F17) was obtained from Empire genomics. Specimens were hybridized to the probes under a glass coverslip or HybriSlip hybridization cover (GRACE Biolabs) sealed with the rubber cement or Cytobond (SciGene) in a humidified chamber at 37 °C for 48–72 h. After hybridization, slides were washed in 50% formamide/2× SSC 3 times for 5 min per wash at 45 °C, then in 1× SSC solution at 45 °C for 5 min twice and at room temperature once. For biotin detection, slides were incubated with fluorescent streptavidin conjugated with Cy5 (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 2–3 h in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and then washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100. Slides were mounted in Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Confocal z-stack images were acquired on the Nikon TiE microscope equipped with PlanApo 100× oil immersion objective NA 1.45, Yokogawa CSU-W1 spinning disk, Flash 4.0 sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu), and NIS Elements software.

For chimpanzee and bonobo cell lines, chromosome spreads specimens were hybridized to the probes under a glass coverslip or HybriSlip hybridization cover (GRACE Biolabs) sealed with rubber cement or Cytobond (SciGene) in a humidified chamber at 37 °C for 48 h. After hybridization, slides were washed in 50% formamide/2× SSC 3 times for 5 min per wash at 45 °C, then in 1× SSC solution at 45 °C for 5 min twice and at room temperature once. For biotin detection, slides were incubated with fluorescent streptavidin conjugated with 488 (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 45 min in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% BSA, and then washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100. Slides were mounted in Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Confocal z-stack images were acquired on the Zeiss LSM 800 microscope equipped with a 63×/1.4 Plan-Apochromat 63× oil immersion objective and Zen Blue software.

For CENP-B and CENP-C immunoFISH, freshly prepared chromosome spreads were dropped on a glass slide, washed with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with 5% BSA in PBS/0.1% Triton X-100. Primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-CENP-B, Abcam, ab25734, rabbit polyclonal anti-CENP-C, Millipore, ABE1957) and secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647, ThermoFisher Scientific) were diluted in 5% BSA/PBS/0.1% Triton X-100. Specimens were incubated with primary antibody overnight, washed 3 times for 5 min, incubated with secondary antibody for 2–4 h and washed again 3 times for 5 min. All washes were performed with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100. After antibody incubation, spreads were post-fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde diluted in PBS for 15 min, washed in PBS, and processed for FISH as described above, starting with an ethanol dehydration series. DNA was stained with 1.5 µg ml−1 DAPI. Confocal z-stack images of CENP-B immunoFISH were acquired on the Nikon TiE microscope as described above. For SIM performed on CENP-C immunoFISH, slides were rinsed in ddH2O, air-dried in the dark, mounted in ProLong Glass antifade mountant (ThermoFisher Scientific) and allowed to cure for at least 24 h before imaging. z-stack images were acquired on an Elyra 7 Lattice SIM2 microscope (Zeiss) equipped with two PCO.edge 4.2 sCMOS cameras, four high power continuous wave lasers (405, 488, 561 and 642 nm) and a Zeiss PlanApo 63× oil immersion objective NA 1.4. The illumination pattern was set to 15 phases, and the z-stack spacing was set at 100 nm. Raw SIM images were reconstructed using the ZEN Black software (Zeiss) with 10.5 manual adjustments for sharpness and best-fit settings for all channels except 405 nm (DAPI), which was processed in the widefield mode. Image pre-processing for SPA-SIM included channel alignment; this analysis randomizes any residual chromatic shifts by averaging randomly oriented chromosomes.

For CENP-A and NDC80 immunoFISH experiments, fibroblasts plated on 150-mm dishes were treated with 100 µM Monastrol (Tocris Bioscience) and 100 µM Apcin (Selleck Chemicals) for 5 h and collected by mitotic shake-off. Collected cells were further incubated with Karyomax colcemid solution (0.1 µg ml−1, Life Technologies) for 15 min. After that, cells were spun down and resuspended in 0.075 M KCl swelling buffer containing 10 mM HEPES, incubated at room temperature for 12 min, washed with ice-cold PBS and kept on ice. Cells (3–4 × 105) were spun onto glass slides using Shandon Cytospin 4 centrifuge (Thermo scientific) at 700–1000 rpm for 3–5 min, washed in KCM buffer (120 mM KCl, 20 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH8, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) and blocked in 5% (w/v) BSA/KCM for 30 min. Slides were then incubated with primary antibodies (mouse anti-CENP-A (3-19) Enzo ADI-KAM-CC006, or mouse anti-NDC80 (9G3.23) ThermoFisher Scientific MA1-23308 with rabbit anti-CENP-A ProSci 30-143) used at 1:100 dilution for 1 h at room temperature, washed 3 times in KCM for 5 min, followed by incubation for 1 h with species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor Plus dyes at 2 µg ml−1, washed again and post-fixed in in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde/KCM for 10 min. Fixed slides were incubated in 50% glycerol/PBS at 4 °C for at least 1 h or overnight. Before hybridization, slides were subjected to a freeze-thaw treatment by dipping into liquid nitrogen, then treated with 0.1 N HCl for 5 min, washed twice in 2× SSC buffer, and pre-incubated in 50% formamide/2× SSC overnight. Fluorescently labelled probes were pre-denatured for 7 min at 80 °C, followed by incubation with the specimen for 3 min at 74 °C, and hybridized under HybriSlip hybridization cover (GRACE Biolabs) sealed with Cytobond (SciGene) in a humidified chamber at 37 °C for 24–48 h. After hybridization, slides were washed in 50% formamide/2× SSC 3 times for 5 min per wash at 45 °C, then in 1× SSC solution at 45 °C for 5 min twice and at room temperature once. DNA was stained with 1.5 µg ml−1 DAPI. After staining was completed, slides were rinsed in ddH2O, air-dried in the dark, mounted in ProLong Glass (ThermoFisher Scientific) and allowed to cure for at least 24 h before SIM imaging.

Maximum intensity projections from spinning disk confocal z-stacks were generated, and chromosomes of interest were segmented manually on the basis of DNA and centromere labelling. Segmented chromosomes from each cell line were oriented vertically and assembled in a new stack consisting of identified specific chromosomes from multiple chromosome spreads. Intensity plot profiles were generated from 2 µm vertical lines with the width of 10 pixels drawn through centromeric regions of each chromosome. Intensity profiles were combined by channel, fit to single Gaussian functions, and aligned to the peak of the Gaussian of the indicated channel. These profiles were then averaged together and normalized to the maximum intensity of each peak. For each chromosome from each cell line, at least ten intensity profiles were averaged and plotted with the s.d. All image processing and analysis were performed using ImageJ/FIJI. A detailed description of this type of analysis and relevant plugins are available at https://research.stowers.org/imagejplugins/spasim.html.

Reconstructed SIM images were mean projected, except for the DAPI channel, which had the slice of highest contrast selected. ROBs and corresponding normal acrocentric chromosomes were identified using centromere FISH signals and segmented manually or with a Cellpose model trained on a combination of the DAPI and centromere signals. Individual chromosomes were transferred to a new image and oriented vertically using a second Cellpose model trained to find a skeleton of the chromosome. Bent chromosomes were straightened in ImageJ/FIJI by manually drawing two annotation lines across centromeres, one through each kinetochore. The straightened images were then aligned to the peak of the specified centromere FISH signal used as the anchor point, and the line intensity profiles were aggregated over multiple images and split by cell line. At least ten chromosomes were analysed for each instance from each cell line. All analysis was performed in ImageJ/FIJI and Python with code at https://github.com/jouyun/Gerton_Robertsonian_2024.

HiFi BAM and ONT FASTQ files with 5mC methylation calls as MM and ML tags were aligned against the generated assemblies using pbmm2 (v.1.13.0, https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbmm2) for HiFi reads and Winnomap (v.2.03)64, for ONT reads. The alignments were then converted to sorted BAM files containing only primary mappings with samtools (v.1.17)65:


# HiFi reads
pbmm2 align {genome}.mmi {bam_with_meth_calls} -j 42 > {output.bam}
samtools view -@ 24 -Sb -F 2048 {output.bam} | samtools sort -@ 24 -T {temporary_directory} - > {output.bam}
samtools index {output.bam}
# ONT reads
winnowmap -t 48 -W {genome}_repetitive_k15.txt -ax map-ont -y {assembly_fasta} {fastq_with_meth_calls} > {output.sam}
samtools view -@ 24 -Sb -F 2048 {output.sam} | samtools sort -@ 24 -T {temporary_directory} - > {output.bam}
samtools index {output.bam}


Aggregated methylation percentages at all CpGs were obtained using modbam2bed (v.0.10.0, https://github.com/epi2me-labs/modbam2bed) with bases with >0.8 probability called “methylated” and bases with <0.2 probability called “unmethylated”:


modbam2bed -t 48 -e -m 5mC --cpg -a 0.20 -b 0.80 {assembly_fasta} {output.bam} > {output.bed}


The CUT&RUN assay was performed using the CUT&RUN Assay Kit (86652, Cell Signaling Technology) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. For each condition, 250,000 cells were pelleted and washed in 1× wash buffer, prepared from 10× wash buffer (31415, Cell Signaling Technology), 100× spermidine (27287, Cell Signaling Technology) and 200× protease inhibitor cocktail (7012, Cell Signaling Technology). Cell suspensions were then incubated with concanavalin A-coated beads for 5 min at room temperature to facilitate binding, followed by resuspension in 1× binding buffer containing 100× spermidine, 200× protease inhibitor cocktail, 40× digitonin solution (Cell Signaling Technology, 16359) and antibody binding buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, 15338). For the detection of CENP-A–DNA interactions, a monoclonal antibody against CENP-A (Enzo, ADI-KAM-CC006-E) was employed at a 1:50 dilution. As controls, tri-methyl-histone H3 (Lys4) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9751, C42D8 rabbit monoclonal antibody) was used at 1:50 dilution as a positive control, while a rabbit IgG XP isotype control (Cell Signaling Technology, 66362, DA1E monoclonal antibody) was applied at 1:10 dilution as a negative control. Antibody incubation was conducted at 4 °C overnight (16 h). Later, the beads were subjected to magnetic separation and washed in digitonin buffer.

The beads were then resuspended in digitonin buffer containing pAG-MNase enzyme (40366) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Following another wash in digitonin buffer, the beads were treated with calcium chloride in digitonin buffer and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min to facilitate MNase activation. The enzymatic digestion was terminated by adding 1× stop buffer (prepared from 4× stop buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, 48105), digitonin solution and 200× RNase A (Cell Signaling Technology, 7013)). For normalization, spike-in DNA (Cell Signaling Technology, 40366) was introduced at a final concentration of 10 pg μl−1 (1:100 dilution). Samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected by centrifugation. DNA was liberated via incubation at 65 °C for 2 h before purification. Input chromatin samples were sheared to fragments ranging from 100–700 base pairs using a Covaris S2 sonicator prior to purification.

DNA purification was performed using a DNA purification with spin columns kit (Cell Signaling Technology, 14209). DNA concentration was assessed using the Qubit dsDNA HS kit for the Qubit Fluorometer.

For anti-CENP-A CUT&Tag, library preparation was used the CUT&Tag-IT kit from Active Motif (53160). Each experiment was performed for 500,000 fresh cells. Fresh cells were washed using 1× wash buffer and nuclei were isolated and incubated with activated concanavalin A-coated magnetic beads in 2 ml PCR tubes at room temperature for 10 min. A 1:100 dilution of primary antibody anti-CENP-A (human) monoclonal antibody (D115-3) in antibody buffer was added and nuclei were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The next day tubes were incubated on a magnetic tube holder and supernatants were discarded. Secondary antibody (rabbit anti-mouse) was diluted at 1:100 in Dig-Wash buffer and nuclei were incubated for 1 h on an orbital rotator at room temperature. Nuclei were washed three times in Dig-Wash buffer and then incubated with a 1:100 dilution of CUT&Tag-IT pA–Tn5 Transposomes for 1 h on an orbital rotator at room temperature. After, 125 μl of tagmentation buffer was added to each sample. To stop tagmentation, 4.2 μl 0.5 M EDTA, 1.25 μl 10% SDS and 1.1 μl 10 mg ml−1 proteinase K was added to each reaction and incubated at 55 °C for 1 h. DNA was barcoded and amplified using the following conditions: a PCR mix of 25 μl NEBNext 2× mix, 2 μl each of barcoded forward and reverse 10 μM primers, and 21 μl of extracted DNA was amplified at: 58 °C for 5 min, 72 °C for 5 min, 98 °C for 45 s, 16× 98 °C for 15 s followed by 63 °C for 10 s, 72 °C for 1 min. Amplified DNA libraries were purified by adding a 1.1× volume of SPRI beads to each sample and incubating for 10 min at 23 °C. Samples were placed on a magnet and liquid was removed. Beads were rinsed twice with 80% ethanol, and DNA was eluted with 20 μl elution buffer. All individually i7-barcoded libraries were mixed at equimolar proportions for sequencing.

Libraries were quantified and individually converted to process on the Singular Genomics G4 with the SG Library Compatibility Kit (700141), following the Adapting Libraries for the G4–Retaining Original Indices protocol. The converted libraries were sequenced in individual lanes on an F3 flow cell (700125) on the G4 instrument, using Instrument Control Software 23.08.1-1 with 100 bp paired reads. Following sequencing, sgdemux 1.2.0 was run to generate FASTQ files.

CUT&Tag and CUT&RUN sequencing reads were trimmed using the trim-galore tool (v.0.6.10, https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore), which included adapter removal. The trimmed reads of each sample were then aligned to the corresponding generated de novo assemblies using bowtie2 (v.2.5.3)66. Post-alignment, the reads were sorted and indexed using samtools (v.1.17)65, to then extract depth information for primary alignments with mosdepth67.

To generate pairwise sequence identity heat maps of each centromeric region, we used a modified version of StainedGlass (v.0.6)39 with the following parameters: window=5000, mm_f = 30000, and mm_s = 1000. Our modifications were applied to visualize the identity heat maps with methylation and CENP-A CUT&Tag information included at the bottom.

To visualize the alignment between the generated assemblies and the CHM13 genome, we used NGenomeSyn26 to generate the synteny plots, which were then manually curated.

We mapped Hi-C reads against the CHM13 genome and the phased genome assemblies of the three cell lines with the BWA aligner68, configured to handle the chimeric nature of Hi-C reads by allowing local mapping and tuning the parameters to minimize gaps. Following read mapping, for each cell line, we constructed three Hi-C contact matrices, one against CHM13 and two against the 2 haplotypes of the respective assembly, by specifying a bin size of 10,000 bp and incorporating restriction site information using HiCExplorer tools69. The resulting matrices were then binned at various resolutions (100 kb, 200 kb and 500 kb) and corrected to normalize the contact frequencies across bins and remove GC and open chromatin biases. Finally, we visualized the corrected matrices using hicPlotMatrix, applying log transformation to handle the wide range of contact counts.

We leveraged multiple reference genomes and assemblies. The primary reference was T2T-CHM13v2.0. We also incorporated the recent diploid T2T-HG002v1.1 genome and 72 samples from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC). The HPRC samples were assembled using Verkko v.2.123, using a combination of sequencing technologies for each sample. The assembly process utilized PacBio High-Fidelity (HiFi) reads and Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) long reads. For phasing, we primarily used short Illumina reads. In cases where trio information was unavailable, Hi-C reads were used for phasing instead.

Assembly graph of GM03417 integrating PacBio and ONT reads visualized using Bandage (https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv383). Each chromosome is mostly resolved as a single connected component, with the exception of the acrocentric chromosomes (13, 14, 15, 21 and 22), which are joined by the highly similar rDNA arrays. The graph is colored by Hi-C information used to phase both haplotypes (haplotype 1, red; haplotype 2, blue). The inset shows a portion of the graph involving the acrocentric chromosomes, highlighting the graph node representing the Robertsonian translocation, which connects chromosomes 14 and 21.

Assembly graph of GM04890 integrating PacBio and ONT reads visualized using Bandage. Each chromosome is mostly resolved as a single connected component, with the exception of the acrocentric chromosomes (13, 14, 15, 21 and 22), which are joined by the highly similar rDNA arrays. The graph is colored by Hi-C information used to phase both haplotypes (haplotype 1, red; haplotype 2, blue). The inset shows a portion of the graph involving the acrocentric chromosomes, highlighting the graph node representing the Robertsonian translocation, which connects chromosomes 13 and 14.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to visualize the arrangement of centromeres, SST1 and 45S rDNA arrays on acrocentric chromosomes in the ROB-bearing cell lines. A. Representative nuclei of ROB cell lines labeled by FISH with probes for Cen 14/22 (orange), Cen 13/21 (green) and DAPI. Bar, 10 µm. Magnified insets show centromeres of ROB chromosomes (bar 1 µm). B. Extended karyograms of GM03786, GM04890, and GM03417 cell lines labeled by FISH with SST1 probe (magenta) and whole chromosome paints (14 in orange, 13 and 21 in green). All acrocentric chromosomes and other chromosomes with detectable SST1 signals are shown. Acrocentric chromosomes lacking SST1 signal are denoted with blue numbers. DNA was counter-stained with DAPI. C. Extended karyograms of acrocentric chromosomes only labeled by FISH with rDNA probe (red), whole chromosome paints, and DAPI. Note lack of rDNA signal on ROBs in all cell lines.

Alignment of chromosome 14 contigs from 29 haplotypes, including 26 from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) year 1 dataset and 3 from ROB cell lines (GM04890, GM03417, and GM03786, highlighted in bold). Each row represents a distinct haplotype aligned against the T2T-CHM13 reference chromosome 14 (bottom track). Gold bars indicate aligned regions, while gaps represent absent and unaligned sequences. The vertical black line marks the position of the SST1 array within the Pseudo-Homolog Region (PHR). The bottom track displays the CHM13 centromeric satellite annotation, with different colors representing various satellite families. Approximately 34.5% (10 out of 29) of the analyzed chromosome 14 haplotypes lack the SST1-containing PHR, including the non-ROB chromosome 14 in the GM03786 cell line. Haplotypes are clustered based on sequence similarity to better visualize the deletion pattern. The x-axis shows the genomic position in megabases (Mb).

Top panel: Structure of the short arms of chromosomes 13/21 and chromosome 14 before fusion. Centromeric, rDNA, and SST1 arrays are highlighted. Note the inverted orientation of the SST1 type 1 array on 14 relative to 13/21. Middle panel: Alignment of 13/21 and 14 during meiosis, showing potential recombination within the SST1 type 1 array region. Bottom panel: Resulting ROB structure after fusion. The ROB retains two centromeres and the SST1 arrays from both parent chromosomes. The central multicopy SST1 array is flanked by sequences from 13 and 14 or 14 and 21. The fusion is within the SST1 subfamily 1 array. The size of the array is variable. The SST1 type 2 L monomer is derived from 13 or 21, while the SST1 type 2S monomer is from 14. The rDNA regions are lost. Key features are color-coded: magenta for SST1 type 1 array, pink for SST1 type 2S monomer, blue for SST1 type 2 L monomer, and gray for centromeres and rDNA regions. Distances between features are indicated in kilobases (kb).

Each row corresponds to the consensus sequence for monomers of SST1 derived from major arrays on chromosomes 13, 14, 21, 17, 19, and 4. The consensuses from chromosomes 13, 14, and 21 (gray labels) have in common a large gap in the middle of the macrosatellite as well as a predicted PRDM9 DNA binding site (red). Darker shades indicate more conservation.

A-B. Representative SIM images of ROB chromosome (A) and normal copies of chromosomes 14 and 21 (B) labeled by immuno-FISH with centromeric satellite probes for Cen 14/22 (orange), Cen 13/21 (green), and anti-CENP-A antibody (white). DNA was counterstained with DAPI. Plots below show averaged line intensity profiles along the individual kinetochore regions of sister chromatids normalized to the maximum intensity of each channel for 20 ROBs (A) and 11 normal copies of chr.14 and chr.21 (B). Error bars denote standard deviations. C. Example SIM images of four individual ROB chromosomes labeled by immuno-FISH with a probe for Cen 13/21 (green), and antibodies against CENP-A (white) and NDC80 (magenta). Magnified insets show centromeric regions labeled with each antibody individually. Line scans (1 and 2) along kinetochores of sister chromatids show normalized fluorescence intensity profiles for CENP-A (blue) and NDC80 (magenta), illustrating variations between kinetochores. D. SIM images and corresponding line scans of representative normal copies of acrocentric chromosomes 13 and 21 labeled and analyzed as in (C). Scale bar in all images is 1 µm.

Tracks displaying CENP_A enrichment in three ROBs (A) GM03786, (B) GM04890, and (C) GM03417. From top to bottom, tracks denote the two α-satellite arrays with centromeric regions colored by chromosome, CENP-A CUT&RUN enrichment (blue) (two replicates), IgG negative control, Input coverage, and CpG methylation profile. DNA methylation tracks show methylation calls from ONT (orange) or PacBio HiFi (light blue) sequencing. CENP-A enrichment is associated with a dip in CpG methylation (CDRs).

ImmunoFISH, DNA methylation, and CENP-A CUT&RUN, and CUT&Tag analysis of normal copies of acrocentric chromosomes from (A) GM03786, (B) GM04890 and (C) GM03417 cell lines are shown. The left panels show representative structured illumination super-resolution images of normal acrocentric chromosomes labeled by immuno-FISH with centromeric satellite probes for Cen 14/22 (orange), Cen 13/21 (green), and anti-CENP-C antibody (red). DNA was counterstained with DAPI. Scale bar is 1 µm. Note single CENP-C foci on corresponding centromeres. Plots below show averaged intensity profiles of lines drawn through the individual kinetochore regions of sister chromatids of multiple chromosomes: GM03786 n = 22 for each chromosome (11 chromosomes 13 and 11 chromosomes 14), GM04890 n = 24 for each chromosome (12 chromosomes 13 and 12 chromosomes 14), GM03417 n = 24 for each chromosome (12 chromosomes14 and 12 chromosomes 21). Intensity profiles were aligned to the peak of the Gaussian of the corresponding Cen signals and normalized to the maximum intensity of each channel. Error bars denote standard deviations. The right panels display corresponding heatmaps of sequence similarity calculated for 5 kb bins for each centromere. Below the heatmaps, DNA methylation tracks show methylation calls from ONT (orange) or PacBio HiFi (blue) sequencing. Hypomethylated regions correspond to CENP-A enrichment on CUT&RUN (blue) and CUT&Tag (black) tracks below, indicating active centromere location.

Among the many types of qubit presently being investigated for a future quantum computer, silicon spin qubits with millions of qubits on a single chip are uniquely positioned to enable quantum computing. However, it has not been clear whether the outstanding high-fidelity operations and long coherence times shown by silicon spin qubits fabricated in academic settings1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 can be reliably reproduced when the qubits are manufactured in a semiconductor foundry9,10,11. Here we show precise qubit operation of silicon two-qubit devices made with standard semiconductor tooling in a 300-mm foundry environment. Of the key metrics, single- and two-qubit control fidelities exceed 99% for all four devices, and the state preparation and measurement fidelities reach up to 99.9%, as evidenced by gate set tomography. We report spin lifetime and coherence up to T1 = 9.5 s, \({T}_{2}^{* }=40.6\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\) and \({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}=1.9\,{\rm{ms}}\). We determine that residual nuclear spin-carrying isotopes contribute substantially to operational errors, identifying further isotopic purification as a clear pathway to even higher performance.

The early academic successes of silicon spin-qubit technology1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 created enthusiasm for the idea that these qubits could be fabricated in industrial 300-mm manufacturing lines9,10,11,12. Potential advantages include the ability to leverage advanced fabrication processes, to integrate qubits with modern electronics and to benefit from the existing capabilities of mass manufacturing at low costs12. Over the past decade, there have been a number of proposals for potential architectures that could be used to realize a scalable quantum computer based on silicon spin qubits13,14,15,16,17.

However, recent attempts to fabricate spins-in-silicon quantum dots using industrial-scale fabrication has raised awareness about the material challenges that must be faced. For example, it is crucial to reduce the charge noise and static disorder arising due to defects and traps at interfaces and oxides18,19,20. High-fidelity single-qubit operations can be performed with minimal impact from charge noise because the electron spin couples to the noisy electric fields only through its weak spin–orbit effects21,22,23,24,25. By contrast, other operations, including qubit initialization, read-out and exchange-based two-qubit gates, are more sensitive to the charge noise present in conventional metal–oxide–semiconductor gate stacks19,24.

This sensitivity has motivated the search for ways of mitigating the effects of charge noise, including moving spin states away from the interface to quantum wells26,27. However, from a scaling perspective, it is desirable to reconcile as much as possible conventional complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) processes with qubit fabrication to leverage the mature CMOS industry to the fullest extent. Moreover, the formation of quantum dots against thin oxides has several benefits, such as a large electric field that leads to large valley splitting18,28,29 and efficient electrostatic coupling between the gate voltage bias and the channel, allowing for well-isolated states, efficient exchange coupling control29 and fast gate-based read-out30.

In this work, we study four two-qubit devices fabricated using a long-established CMOS geometry, namely a planar metal–oxide–semiconductor with polysilicon gates31. We demonstrate for all devices all basic qubit operations, including one- and two-qubit gates, initialization and read-out, with error rates approaching and surpassing the fault-tolerance threshold for the widely studied surface error correction code32. We obtain these error rates using state-of-the-art gate set tomography (GST) tools33,34, allowing us to pinpoint effects such as crosstalk and the breakdown between stochastic and coherent errors. Our studies indicate unprecedented reproducible low error levels while also identifying clear pathways to further reducing errors.

The qubit devices were designed by Diraq and fabricated at imec in a 300-mm spin-qubit process flow that is described in Methods. The resulting wafer consists of several devices covering a range of feature sizes and configurations. We chose the design that we estimated would have optimal device parameters, and we tested four of these devices (denoted A–D). The design consists of a double quantum dot and a nearby single-electron transistor (SET) for spin read-out1 (Fig. 1a).

a, Schematic of a Diraq two-qubit device fabricated on a 300-mm wafer, showing the full wafer, single die and single device level. b, Charge stability diagram of device A as a function of plunger (P1 and P2) voltage detuning ΔVP = ΔVP1 = −ΔVP2 and exchange gate (J) voltage VJ, showing four isolated electrons in the double-dot system. Devices B–D were also measured in the (3,1) charge configuration and showed analogous charge stability diagrams. Voltage points for single-qubit operation (Joff < 1 kHz), two-qubit operation (Jon ≈ 1 MHz) and read-out are shown as a triangle, inverted triangle and star, respectively. The faint charge transition starting from VJ = 1.05 V is very weakly coupled to the quantum dot and probably corresponds to charge movement outside the active dot confinement area. In device D, we observed similar charge movements outside the active dot region; devices B and C showed none. Inset, Cross section of the double-quantum-dot device indicating the number of electrons under the plunger gates (P1 and P2), exchange gate (J) and double potential well. Scale bars, 100 nm (a, top), 10 mm (a, middle), 300 mm (a, bottom). a.u., arbitrary units.

We operated the devices in a 3He/4He dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of 10 mK in isolated mode, with four electrons in the double dot formed under the plunger gate electrodes (P1 and P2). A voltage applied to an interstitial exchange gate (J) controlled the tunnel coupling between the dots1,35,36. The electrons were loaded from a two-dimensional electron gas formed under the reservoir gate, which overlaps with an n++ implanted ohmic region. The Pauli spin blockade at the (3,1)–(4,0) charge transition was used for spin parity read-out and the signal was measured using the SET in d.c. mode (Fig. 1b). SET charge-noise measurements reveal a 1/fα power spectral density with α between 0.50(7) and 1.19(5) and an amplitude of 0.79(4)–\(0.98(7)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{eV}}/\sqrt{{\rm{Hz}}}\) at 1 Hz (Extended Data Fig. 1), in line with previous low charge-noise results from devices fabricated using similar methods19,21.

A static magnetic field B0 in the range 0.662–0.7 T split the spin states to form the single-qubit states, which were manipulated with on-resonance microwave signals applied to the electron spin resonance antenna with frequency fESR. Single-qubit Xπ/2 gates were formed with timed microwave pulses on resonance with the qubit Larmor frequencies fL,Q1 and fL,Q2 (Fig. 2), whereas Zπ/2 gates were implemented as virtual gates through rotations of the reference frame37. The single-qubit metrics, including spin lifetime and Ramsey and Hahn coherence times, for the four devices are shown in Table 1.

Probability of reading out an even or blockaded spin state Peven, when applying microwave signal at the frequency fESR – fLO for a duration of tESR. c,d, Coherent Rabi oscillations at fL,Qi for qubits 1 (c) and 2 (d). Real-time feedback is implemented to counteract the Larmor frequency deviation39. The local oscillator frequency is set to fLO = 18.610 GHz. The microwave power applied to qubit 1 is approximately 7% larger than that to qubit 2 resulting in matching Rabi frequencies of fRabi = 658.6(3) kHz.

Figure 3 details our implementation of two-qubit control. A voltage pulse, typically of duration tCZ between 100 ns and 500 ns, was applied to the J gate to control the exchange interaction strength (Fig. 3a–c). We performed the two-qubit gate at the symmetric charge operation point to reduce the sensitivity to the detuning noise38 (Fig. 3d). We extracted from the fitted exchange frequencies in Fig. 3c an exchange controllability of 18.4 dec V−1 (devices A–D are compared in Fig. 3e). By combining a pulsed exchange interaction with single-qubit phase rotations, we were able to implement a controlled-Z (CZ) two-qubit gate1 (Fig. 3f,g). Using real-time feedback, we tracked and corrected the SET voltage operation point and the single-qubit Larmor and Rabi frequencies39 (see Extended Data Fig. 3 for details). We used a heralded initialization protocol to check if the qubit system was successfully initialized in the \(| \downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) state, and we repeated the initialization if unsuccessful7,40.

a,b, Probability of detecting an even spin state Peven after a microwave burst of fixed power and duration at different J gate voltages VJ when preparing a mixed odd state of \(| \downarrow \uparrow \rangle \) and \(| \uparrow \downarrow \rangle \) (a) and a pure even state \(| \downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) (b). The power and duration of the microwave burst are roughly calibrated to a single-qubit π rotation. The local oscillator frequency is set to fLO = 18.610 GHz. The mixed odd state is initialized with a tramp = 1 μs ramp at VJ = 0.96 V over the anti-crossing and the even state with heralded initialization based on a tramp = 1 μs ramp at VJ = 1.12 V. All experiments throughout the paper were conducted with an even state \(| \downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) initialization, unless otherwise specified. c, Controlled phase (CZ) oscillation as a function of exchange time texchange and exchange gate voltage VJ. We apply dynamical decoupling by a consecutive π rotation on both qubits to filter out other phase-accumulating effects, such as Stark shift. d, Decoupled exchange oscillation fingerprint for fixed exchange time texchange = 10 μs as a function of plunger voltage detuning ΔVP and exchange gate voltage VJ. The triangle indicates the exchange gate voltage used for the CZ gate. e, Exchange strength as a function of exchange gate voltage extracted from fitting exchange oscillations in c. The controllability is fitted assuming Jexchange ∝ a exp bVJ, resulting in a range between b = 9.78 dec V−1 and 18.44 dec V−1 across devices A–D. The variation in exchange controllability across the devices is probably due to fabrication variability. f,g, Calibration of the CZ single-qubit phase correction by preparing the target spin in superposition, applying a CPHASE followed by a virtual phase rotation for qubits 1 (f) and 2 (g)4,7. Vertical lines indicate the phase values for which the spin state of Q1 (Q2) is flipped if Q2 (Q1) is in the on/spin-up state. The read-out probability is unscaled in all data.

To precisely capture errors in qubit operation, we designed a GST experiment comprising the full gate set {II, XI, IX, ZI, IZ, CZ}, from which we constructed a list of ‘preparation' and ‘measurement fiducials' circuits. Combining these fiducials with ‘germ' circuits up to length 16, we obtained a list of 12,263 unique sequences34. We chose GST as the benchmarking method because it yields the error taxonomy with specific error channels and is generally a higher bar for fidelities than the more commonly used interleaved randomized benchmarking, which often overestimates fidelities8.

We implemented an idle gate with a total idle time equal to the duration of a CZ gate. Single-qubit gates in the two-qubit context were achieved by rotating one qubit π/2 around the \(\widehat{x}\) axes (XI and IX) and \(\widehat{z}\) axes (ZI and IZ), while the other qubit was idling. The XI and IX gates were implemented by applying a microwave square pulse of around 400 ns, including a 20-ns smooth sine ramp, at fL,Q1 and fL,Q2 for qubits 1 and 2, respectively. The ZI and IZ gates were implemented by virtually rotating the reference frame for qubits 1 and 2, respectively. The entangling two-qubit CZ gate was implemented by applying a voltage pulse to the exchange gate J for a duration of tCZ.

Figure 4 breaks down the error generators and their contribution to the infidelity for each gate and device. Across all four devices operation accuracies are above 99%. For example, for device A, the gate fidelities are 99.45(5)%, 99.55(4)%, 99.95(4)%, 99.96(4)%, 99.74(9)% and 99.37(5)% for the XI, IX, ZI, IZ, II and CZ, respectively (see first row of Table 1). The combined state preparation and measurement (SPAM) fidelity even exceeds 99.9% with FSPAM = 99.95(8)%, which is one of the highest reported values for industrially fabricated spin qubits (Extended Data Fig. 4). Single-qubit on-target gate fidelities FX,Q1 = 99.97(15)% and FX,Q2 = 99.81(11)% are comparable to previously reported values for devices made using the same fabrication processes21.

a–d, Infidelity contributions of Hamiltonian and stochastic error generators across all four devices for the XI (a), IX (b), II (c) and CZ (d) gates from GST. Hamiltonian errors contribute to the infidelity in second order, whereas stochastic errors contribute in first order. Stochastic errors, particularly the idling ZI and IZ error generator components, dominate the infidelity by more than an order of magnitude. All gate fidelities across all devices are above 99%. Error bars represent the 95% confidence level. For visibility, only those of the IZ and ZI error generators are displayed.

All four devices have fidelities of 99% or higher across all operations, with XI (IX), ZI (IZ) and CZ gates ranging between 99.23(3)% and 99.59(15)% (99.18(5)% and 99.64(3)%), between 99.95(5)% and 99.97(3)% (99.95(5)% and 99.97(3)%) and between 99.04(16)% and 99.56(6)% (Table 1). Furthermore, the stochastic IZ and ZI error generators dominate the infidelity contributions across all devices. In particular, the stochastic IZ component is larger for the CZ gate compared with the I gate, which is probably related to the (3,1) charge configuration used in all devices. In future work, a systematic study of the (1,3) charge configuration, as well as higher electron occupations such as (3,3) across several devices, would provide valuable insights into the physical origin of the observed error mechanisms. SPAM fidelities reproducibly exceed 99.9% for three out of the four devices (devices A, C and D). For device B, we achieved a SPAM fidelity of 99.33(9)%. We attribute this slightly reduced SPAM fidelity to signs of gate leakage between the SET barrier and the ohmic contacts. Similarly, device D shows leakage between the SET barrier and the plunger gate used to form qubit 2, which is the probable cause of the reduced spin relaxation and coherence time of qubit 2 (Table 1).

Additionally, we performed d.c. cryo-probing measurements on a further 16 devices: one with the same design parameters as devices A–D and 15 with different design parameters, all from the same imec wafer. These measurements indicate excellent uniform electrostatic control over all device gate electrodes (Extended Data Fig. 5).

Device A exemplifies the high performance of qubits on the 300-mm wafer and can, therefore, be used as a case study to examine the sources of infidelity. In the following sections, we analyse the GST error contributions and their probable physical origins in device A, as well as its qubit performance as a function of magnetic field. Based on the consistency of the dominating errors reported in Fig. 4 and the similarity of the Larmor frequency dynamics in Extended Data Fig. 3, we expect this conclusion to hold for all four devices.

The ZI and IZ gates were implemented virtually and are, therefore, in principle error-free. However, the clock update on the field-programmable gate array took a finite time, leading to slight imperfections in these virtual operations due to idling errors. Hence, we attribute their infidelities, 0.05(4)% (0.04(4)%) for ZI (IZ), to a small time delay in the control hardware.

Most importantly, the largest contribution to infidelity for the XI, II and CZ gates is the stochastic IZ error generator, whereas the IX gate is limited by the stochastic ZI error generator, with the second highest contribution being the stochastic IZ error generator, followed by the stochastic IY error generator (Fig. 4). The stochastic dephasing error generator of the qubit undergoing a π/2 rotation (ZI for the XI gate and IZ for the IX gate) is significantly larger for the IX gate than for the XI gate. However, for the idle qubit (IZ for the XI gate and ZI for the IX gate), it is significantly larger for the XI gate than for the IX gate. Similarly, the infidelity contribution to the II gate from the stochastic dephasing error generator IZ (0.15%) is larger than for ZI (0.09%).

First, these error contributions could be explained by the coupling of 29Si nuclear spins to the electron spin state of qubit 2 (ref. 41). Qubit 1 also experiences quasi-static changes in the Larmor frequency, but these are of lower magnitude, despite the Stark shifts of qubit 1 being larger (Extended Data Fig. 3). This is another indication that hyperfine-coupled residual 29Si nuclear spins are the origin of that noise. As expected, these idling errors are roughly doubled (tXI = tIX = 400 ns) in comparison with the idling gate, which only takes around half the time. Comparing the II gate with the CZ gate, the stochastic ZI error generator remains constant (0.09%), but the IZ error generator more than doubles (0.40%), despite both gates having the same duration tII = tCZ = 212 ns. However, during CZ gate operation, the tunable exchange barrier is lowered to enable the Heisenberg exchange. This leads to a shift in the centre of the electron wavefunction, possibly moving qubit 2 closer to the 29Si nuclear spin, thus increasing the contact hyperfine interaction and the quasi-static noise in IZ.

Second, it might seem contradictory that the gate infidelity is dominated by noise in qubit 2, given that \({T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}} > {T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}1}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\) and \({T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}2}^{* }\approx {T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}1}^{* }\). However, the GST experiments are designed to amplify, not echo out, persistent noise sources. They are, therefore, heavily affected by slow noise, such as Larmor frequency changes arising from hyperfine-coupled nuclear spins. On the other hand, Hahn echo experiments are limited by fast charge noise. The Larmor frequency variation, tracked during the GST experiment using real-time feedback39,40, shows a higher standard deviation for the qubit 2 frequency variation compared with qubit 1 (Extended Data Fig. 3). Furthermore, the infidelities of the XI, IX, II and CZ gates decrease for higher Larmor feedback rates, with the main contribution again being the stochastic IZ error generator for the XI, II and CZ and the stochastic ZI error generators for the IX gate (Extended Data Fig. 6).

Third, sequences between which the Larmor frequency feedback exhibits a large frequency change can be removed from the GST dataset, but this has a significant effect only on the stochastic IZ error generator of the XI gate (Extended Data Fig. 7). Moreover, the spread of the Larmor frequency is independent of B0, whereas the Stark shift increases linearly (Extended Data Figs. 8 and 9) and the spin–orbit interaction in qubit 1 is stronger compared with qubit 2, as can be seen in Fig. 3a,b. The standard deviation of the Larmor frequency feedback increases in a step-like manner as a function of total experiment runtime for distinct instances across all magnetic fields (Extended Data Fig. 10). Hence, these slow timescale jumps probably originate from qubit 2 coupling strongly to the nuclear spin states of the residual 29Si atoms. As such, they contribute significantly to the gate infidelities and are the cause of the above-described observations2,42,43. These slow jumps in the Larmor frequency do not contribute to \({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\) and, therefore, do not contradict \({T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}} > {T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}1}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\).

In terms of qubit device performance, Fig. 5 shows spin lifetime and coherence metrics as functions of the magnetic field B0. T1 and \({T}_{2}^{* }\) first increase up to B0 = 0.3–0.4 T, followed by a decrease for larger B0. Because \({T}_{2}^{* }\) is sensitive to d.c. noise, it samples 1/f noise down to frequencies corresponding to the total time of the experiment, which renders it a bad metric for comparing different qubits or qubit platforms. Including Larmor frequency feedback in the experiment reduces the contribution of low-frequency 1/f noise44. We demonstrate this in Extended Data Fig. 11a,b by plotting \({T}_{2}^{* }\) as a function of the cumulative measurement time. Most curves are approximately flat, showing the effectiveness of the feedback mechanism. Extended Data Fig. 11c,d show the variation of \({T}_{2}^{* }\) as a function of laboratory time.

a–c, Spin lifetime T1 (a), Ramsey \({T}_{2}^{* }\) (b) and Hahn echo \({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\) (c) metrics as functions of the applied magnetic field amplitude B0. We measured both qubits for each experiment interleaved and repeated this 50 (T1), 10,000 (\({T}_{2}^{* }\)) and 2,000 (\({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\)) times. Ramsey experiments at B0 = 0.05 T, 0.1 T, 0.8 T and 1.1 T were repeated 50,000, 100,000, 50,000 and 40,000 times. The Hahn echo experiment at B0 = 1.3 T was repeated 500 times. Between each repeat we used real-time Larmor frequency feedback following the protocol described in ref. 39. The data were fitted using the functions described in Extended Data Fig. 2. Data shown as stars correspond to metrics measured during two-qubit benchmarking (Extended Data Fig. 2), using a method and gate voltages that differed from those used for the magnetic field sweep. Error bars represent the 95% confidence level.

The longest measured coherence times for device A include Hahn echo coherence time \({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}=\text{1,900}\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\) (1,805 μs) for qubit 2 (qubit 1) measured at the low magnetic field of B0 = 50 mT, as well as \({T}_{2}^{* }\) = 40.6 μs (39.0 μs) and T1 = 9.5 s (4.7 s). The long \({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\) and its small variation between both qubits indicate that magnetic noise dominates at low fields. On increasing B0, the Stark shift increases linearly (Extended Data Fig. 9), with steeper slopes for qubit 1 (ΔΩStark(P1, J, P2) = (−19.9(4), 31.3(3), 14.2(4)) MHz V−1 T−1) than for qubit 2 ((0, 3.2(2), 16.7(4)) MHz V−1 T−1), manifesting in stronger coupling to charge noise through the spin–orbit interaction and resulting in reduced coherence, with a 33% larger \({T}_{2,Q2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}=617(26)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\) (\({T}_{2,Q1}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}=464(22)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\)) at B0 = 1.3 T. The observed Stark shift is entirely caused by the intrinsic spin–orbit coupling of silicon electrons confined at the Si/SiO2 interface. For device A, the external magnetic field points in the [110] lattice orientation, where the variability of the g factor is highest and the Dresselhaus spin–orbit component dominates. This type of spin–orbit coupling is largely influenced by atomistic roughness at the Si/SiO2 interface29. In the presence of a gate bias, the quantum dot moves under the rough interface, shifting its g factor. The magnitude and sign of the resulting Stark shift depends on the direction in which the gate moves the quantum dot. Typical values range between −80 MHz V−1 T−1 to 80 MHz V−1 T−1 (ref. 25). In device A, we obtained −20 MHz V−1 T−1 to 30 MHz V−1 T−1, which falls within that range. The magnetic field dynamics of the spin coherence times are distinct from previous results for academic devices7, and the exact physical origin requires a more detailed study, which is beyond the scope of this work.

Looking forward, the increase in \({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\) for low fields is extremely encouraging because it indicates that the qubits are amenable to more scalable control techniques. Such approaches continuously drive the spin by using a modulated microwave field to decouple it from noise and eliminate free precession (\({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\gg {T}_{2}^{* }\))36,45. Operation at lower fields requires a different modality of the two-qubit gate. To achieve similarly fast gates, a SWAP-like operation will be implemented. Furthermore, at low fields an always-on, global control is beneficial for avoiding idling errors and using the long decoupling times \({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\gg {T}_{2}^{* }\) observed. This can be achieved by aligning the magnetic field direction such that the Larmor frequencies of the qubits become degenerate45. The key challenge for that operation modality is sufficiently large Stark shifts.

Our chosen implementation of an entangling gate (CZ) is faster than decoupling schemes, but it relies on the exchange interaction being smaller than the Zeeman energy difference of the two qubits (Jexc ≪ ΔEZ). We chose B0 values in the range 0.662–0.7 T to meet this requirement, but in future, we intend to explore other two-qubit gate implementations8.

We have demonstrated high-fidelity control of semiconductor qubits industrially manufactured in a 300-mm pilot line. In contrast to previous publications in which charge noise is identified as the key limiting factor3,4,5,8,38,46,47, our results are strongly encouraging from a noise-analysis perspective, both in terms of the fidelity values themselves, and in view of the clear pathway they pave towards further improvement through further nuclear purification. Further isotopic enrichment of the 400-ppm 29Si used in this work to levels at or below 50 ppm has already been demonstrated in academic prototype devices7. This is consistent with previous results showing the effect of nuclear spin noise on coherence times in Si/SiGe quantum-dot spin qubits20.

We have shown that using engineering practices in an industrial setting can lead to state-of-the-art spin-qubit performance when coupled with a systematic search for target performance metrics. It is crucial to understand the connection between qubit performance and measurements that can be performed during the fabrication process, such as electrical noise and Hall bar transport19,48. These investigations are in their infancy and will require an increasingly accurate model of the quantum behaviour of electrons in semiconductor devices.

In the long term, further improvements will be required on the qubit front, for which our noise analysis provides a first-order angle of attack. To reduce the overhead for fault-tolerant quantum computing32, 99.9% fidelities across all operations is a realistic target.

At this stage, a statistical analysis of these qubits at a larger scale is not yet available. The consistent calibration of qubits at the level demonstrated here remains an intensive manual process with a number of scientific insights gained along the way. Automation of this process needs to mature to consistently achieve these results in a mass-characterization campaign49. Having silicon–metal–oxide–semiconductor (SiMOS) qubits fabricated in a foundry environment readily available will facilitate the future demonstration of large-scale SiMOS qubit arrays. This has so far been challenging for SiMOS spin qubits because it has been difficult to fabricate devices with small gate pitches and low charge-noise interfaces.

These results could be leveraged to design quantum error correction strategies to cater to the specific demands of spin qubits. However, further studies will be needed to characterize qubit operations in a more scalable setting, such as under a single global microwave field and under elevated temperatures, which will inevitably be imposed by the heat dissipated by the co-integrated control electronics on the CMOS chip50,51,52. Our reproducible demonstrations of high-quality qubit operation made using 300-mm foundry processes offer a proof of principle that should encourage further industrial research into far more complex technologies that are at the disposal of foundries.

The fabrication method used at imec was optimized for low charge noise, high uniformity19,31,53,54 and qubit-specific integration with a gate pitch smaller than 100 nm. Fast fabrication cycles and design flexibility were ensured by optimally combining optical lithography and electron-beam lithography. Fabrication started with the epitaxial growth of an isotopically enriched layer of silicon with a residual concentration of 400 ppm 29Si. A high-quality thermally grown oxide forms the Si/SiO2 interface at which the charge of the electron spin qubit accumulates. Dedicated cleaning processes and 300-mm pilot line process control are key to the development of the high-quality interface19. Next, a triple-layer overlapping polysilicon gate stack was formed using electron-beam lithography and dry etching, with each gate separated by a thin interstitial high-temperature oxide deposit19. The highly doped polysilicon gates reduced the interface strain at cryogenic temperatures54,55. Finally, an aluminium strip line was patterned so that single spin states could be manipulated using electron spin resonance, offering a control solution at the few-qubit level50,52 (Extended Data Fig. 12).

Devices A, B, C and D were measured in Bluefors XLD400, Bluefors LD400, and two different Oxford Instruments K100 Kelvinox dilution refrigerators, respectively, and mounted on the cold finger. Previous work conducted with similar experimental set-ups indicates that the electron temperature was 200–300 mK (ref. 56). An American Magnetics AMI430 supplied static external magnetic fields to devices A, B and C, with the field for A pointing in the [110] direction of the Si lattice and those for B and C pointing in the [1\(\overline{1}\)0] direction. The field for device D was supplied by an Oxford Instruments IPS120-10 pointing in the [1\(\overline{1}\)0] direction of the Si lattice.

We used a Q-Devil QDAC-II to supply d.c. voltages through filtered lines with a bandwidth of up to 20 Hz. Dynamic voltage pulses were generated with a field-programmable gate array, in this experiment the Quantum Machines Operator-X+ (OPX+). The pulses were combined with d.c. biases using custom linear bias combiners at room temperature. The OPX+ had a sampling time of 1 ns.

The dynamic pulse lines in the fridge had a bandwidth of up to 50 MHz, which translated into a minimum rise time of 20 ns. We accounted for this by smoothing out fast a.c. pulsing. Microwave pulses were generated by a vector signal generator (PSG8267D, Keysight). The in-phase and quadrature and pulse modulation waveforms were generated by the OPX+.

The charge sensor comprised a single-island SET in d.c. mode. The SET current integrated for tint = 100 μs was amplified using a room-temperature I–V converter (Basel SP983c) and sampled by the OPX+. At this stage, we used d.c. mode read-out, which was limited by the bandwidth and noise of the room-temperature transimpedance amplifier, leaving high-bandwidth cryogenic current amplification for future work.

Gate times were optimized based on a trade-off between speed and lifetime. The magnetic field amplitude B0 was chosen in the range 0.662–0.7 T, such that the single-qubit Rabi QRabi = fRabiTRabi was maximized. Simultaneously, the chosen implementation of entangling gate relied on the exchange interaction being smaller than the Zeeman energy difference of the two qubits (Jexc ≪ ΔEZ). We chose our B0 values to meet this requirement.

Noise spectrum at a high and a low-sensitivity point of a Coulomb oscillation at B0 = 0.662 − 0.7 T for devices A–D. Voltage noise spectrum is first calculated using a Fast Fourier transform on extracted SET current measurements divided by the slope of the Coulomb peak, and finally converted into a charge noise spectrum in μeV using the lever arm58. Charge noise at 1 Hz ranges between \(0.79(4)-0.98(7)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{e}}{\rm{V}}/\sqrt{{\rm{H}}{\rm{z}}}\). Solid line is a power law fit of the power spectral density with exponent ranging between a = 0.50(7) − 1.19(5).

a,b, Spin relaxation of qubit 1 (a) and 2 (b) spin up to the ground state \(| \downarrow \downarrow \rangle \). Curves are fitted to an exponential decay resulting in a relaxation time of T1,Q1 = 2.4(2) s (a = 0.999, b = 0.847) and T1,Q2 = 6.3(6) s (a = 0.989, b = 1.183), respectively. For long wait times, the pure \(| \downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) state decays to its thermal equilibrium following the Fermi-Dirac distribution at finite temperatures. c,d, Ramsey experiment for qubit 1 (c) and 2 (d) fitted to a sinusoidal exponential decay resulting in a coherence time of \({T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}1}^{* }=30.2(6)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\) (a = −0.498, fdet = 95 kHz, b = 1.874, c = 0.498) and \({T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}2}^{* }=29.1(6)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\) (a = −0.488, fdet = 102 kHz, b = 1.884, c = 0.499), respectively. The oscillation is induced by a phase shift corresponding to a 100 kHz detuning. Every data point is averaged for 1,000 repeats, each integrating the readout signal for tint = 100 μs. We use real-time Larmor frequency feedback between repeats using the protocol described in ref. 39. e,f, Hahn echo experiment for qubit 1 (e) and 2 (f) fitted to an exponential decay resulting in a coherence time of \({T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}1}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}=445(6)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\) (a = 0.931, b = 1.263, c = 0.035) and \({T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}=803(6)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\) (a = 0.908, b = 3.125, c = 0.040), respectively. We measure all six single qubit projections and fit the state purity γstate. Error bars represent the 95% confidence level.

a–d, Single qubit Larmor frequency deviation of qubit 1 and 2 across devices A – D (a–d) as a function of lab time during a GST experiment nominally equivalent to the ones discussed in the main text (Fig. 4). Figures are plotted with the same y-axis range. The standard deviation of the frequency feedback of qubit 2 (73–99 kHz) is larger compared to qubit 1 (27–52 kHz) across all devices. The microwave local oscillator frequency is set to fLO = 18.610−19.590 GHz (compare Table 1). Frequency feedback is implemented by following the protocol described in ref. 39.

GST-estimated SPAM operations, with the initial state represented as a density matrix and the terminating parity measurement as a POVM, yield a \(| \downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) state initialization fidelity of Finit = 99.996(49)% and an even/odd parity measurement of Fmeas = 99.959(59)%, respectively. The combined state preparation and measurement fidelity is calculated to FSPAM = 99.95(8)%. Error bars represent the 95% confidence level.

Each plot shows I–V data for 16 quantum-dot devices (coloured curves) measured with a cryo-prober at around 1 K. One device with same design parameters as devices A–D, and 15 with different design parameters, all from the same 300 mm wafer. Different panels pertain to the gate electrodes (EB1, P1, J, P2, EB2, RG, CBs) or to all gates (top left).

Gate infidelities \(1-{\mathcal{F}}\) benchmarked using GST as a function of Larmor frequency feedback rate (the frequency at which the feedback is executed and the Larmor frequency updated) at B0 = 0.666 T. We estimate the precision to be ~5 kHz, based on the deviation from the induced 100 kHz oscillations in Ramsey experiments shown in Extended Data Fig. 2. The virtual ZI and IZ gates are independent of the Larmor frequency and omitted. Each GST experiment consists of 12,263 sequences repeated 100 times. The Larmor frequency feedback circuit is executed with increasing rate, i.e. after every 3000th, 1000th, 300th, 100th, 30th, 10th, 3rd, and single GST gate sequence. All gate infidelities decrease with increasing Larmor frequency feedback rate. The dominant infidelity contribution to the XI, II, and CZ gate is the stochastic IZ error generator, originating from idling of qubit 2. The IX gate infidelity is dominated by the respective ZI error generator, originating from idling of qubit 1. Hamiltonian ZI and IZ error generators, not plotted here, contribute about 0.4% to the infidelity of the CZ gate. Better calibration, as done in the main text (Fig. 4), removes the Hamiltonian errors almost entirely and brings the all gate infidelities below the commonly targeted 1% infidelity threshold represented by the black dashed line. Error bars represent the 95% confidence level.

Infidelity contribution of Hamiltonian and stochastic error generators of the full gate set XI (a), IX (b), ZI (c), IZ (d), II (e), and CZ (f) comparing the effect of removing gate sequences with Larmor frequency jumps > 50 kHz in post-selection at B0 = 0.666 T using GST. Hamiltonian errors contribute to the infidelity in second order, while stochastic errors contribute in first order. The ZI and IZ gates are implemented virtually and are independent of that post selection within error bars. The original (without post-selection) GST experiment consisted of 12,263 sequences, with Larmor frequency feedback after every 10th sequence, repeated 400 times. 171 repeats passed the post-selection for analysis. Error bars represent the 95% confidence level.

a,b, Larmor frequency feedback σ(ΔfL) during interleaved Ramsey and Hahn echo measurements for different magnetic field amplitudes B0 of qubit 1 and 2, respectively. Each Ramsey experiment is repeated at least 10,000 times, with Larmor frequency feedback before each repeat, corresponding to 10,000 data points and roughly 25 min. For magnetic field amplitudes of B0 = 0.05 T, 0.1 T, 0.8 T, and 1.1 T, 50,000, 100,000, 50,000, and 40,000 Ramsey repeats are measured and then truncated in post batched in chunks of 10,000 repeats displayed here shaded. Each Hahn experiment is repeated 2,000 times for all six state projections [+X,−X,+Y,−Y,+Z,−Z], with Larmor feedback between each repeat for each projection, corresponding to 12,000 data points and roughly 30 min. The Hahn echo experiment for B0 = 1.3 T is only repeated 500 times.

a,b, Standard deviation of the Larmor frequency variation σ(ΔfL) obtained from real-time Larmor frequency feedback during interleaved Ramsey and Hahn echo measurements as a function of magnetic field amplitudes B0 of qubit 1 and 2, respectively. The second y-axis on the right shows the Stark shift ΔΩStark of three gates P1, J, and P2 in the active region forming the double-dot system. Dashed lines follow a linear fit ΔΩStark ⋅ B0, resulting in ΔΩStark(P1, J, P2) = (−19.9(4), 31.3(3), 14.2(4)) MHz/(V·T) and = (0, 3.2(2), 16.7(4)) MHz/(V·T) for qubit 1 and 2, respectively. Error bars for the standard deviation of the Larmor frequency variation are only extracted for magnetic field amplitudes of B0 = 0.05 T, 0.1 T, 0.8 T, and 1.1 T with 50,000, 100,000, 50,000, and 40,000 Ramsey repeats batched in chunks of 10,000, respectively. Error bars represent the 95% confidence level.

a,b, Standard deviation of the Larmor frequency variation σ(ΔfL) obtained from real-time Larmor frequency feedback during interleaved Ramsey measurements as a function of total run time for a range of magnetic field amplitudes B0 of qubit 1 and 2, respectively. The second y-axis on the right shows the inverse 1/σ(ΔfL) as an approximation for expected \({T}_{2}^{* }\).

a,b, Cumulative \({T}_{2}^{* }\) of qubit 1 and 2 as a function of increasing number of experiment repeats and total measurement time for a range of magnetic field amplitudes B0, respectively. Each experiment is defined by 101 shots of the Ramsey circuit with varying wait time. c,d, \({T}_{2}^{* }\) of qubit 1 and 2 as a function of lab time, respectively. Each data point is obtained by 100 repeated Ramsey experiments taking a total of approximately 15 s. We use real-time Larmor frequency feedback between Ramsey experiment repeats. Shaded error regions represent the 95% confidence level.

Metrics details

Cell types are fundamental functional units that can be traced across the tree of life. Rapid advances in single-cell technologies, coupled with the phylogenetic expansion in genome sequencing, present opportunities for the molecular characterization of cells across a broad range of organisms. Despite these developments, our understanding of eukaryotic cell diversity remains limited and we are far from decoding this diversity from genome sequences. Here we introduce the Biodiversity Cell Atlas initiative, which aims to create comprehensive single-cell molecular atlases across the eukaryotic tree of life. This community effort will be phylogenetically informed, rely on high-quality genomes and use shared standards to facilitate comparisons across species. The Biodiversity Cell Atlas aspires to deepen our understanding of the evolution and diversity of life at the cellular level, encompassing gene regulatory programs, differentiation trajectories, cell-type-specific molecular profiles and inter-organismal interactions.

Haplotype phasing — to determine which genetic variants reside on the same chromosome — and genotype imputation — to infer unobserved genotypes — have become indispensable steps to improve genome coverage for genomic analyses such as genome-wide association studies. Several tools exist for haplotype phasing and genotype imputation, all of which have continuously evolved to accommodate the increasing sample sizes of genomic studies and rapidly improving sequencing technologies. To fully leverage these recent advances, researchers must deliberate several practical considerations, including tool choice, quality control filters, data privacy concerns and reference panel choice. Looking ahead, long-read sequencing technologies are poised to bring novel opportunities to this field and drive methodological development.

Yu, K. et al. Meta-imputation: an efficient method to combine genotype data after imputation with multiple reference panels. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 109, 1007–1015 (2022). This paper introduces meta-imputation to combine imputed results from multiple reference panels. It is helpful in scenarios where multiple references are suitable, for example, where a small population-specific (or disease cohort) reference panel is available in addition to a large reference panel from general or mismatched populations.

Metrics details

Neuroblastoma is a highly lethal childhood tumour derived from differentiation-arrested neural crest cells1,2. Like all cancers, its growth is fuelled by metabolites obtained from either circulation or local biosynthesis3,4. Neuroblastomas depend on local polyamine biosynthesis, and the inhibitor difluoromethylornithine has shown clinical activity5. Here we show that such inhibition can be augmented by dietary restriction of upstream amino acid substrates, leading to disruption of oncogenic protein translation, tumour differentiation and profound survival gains in the Th-MYCN mouse model. Specifically, an arginine- and proline-free diet decreases the amount of the polyamine precursor ornithine and enhances tumour polyamine depletion by difluoromethylornithine. This polyamine depletion causes ribosome stalling, unexpectedly specifically at codons with adenosine in the third position. Such codons are selectively enriched in cell cycle genes and low in neuronal differentiation genes. Thus, impaired translation of these codons, induced by combined dietary and pharmacological intervention, favours a pro-differentiation proteome. These results suggest that the genes of specific cellular programmes have evolved hallmark codon usage preferences that enable coherent translational rewiring in response to metabolic stresses, and that this process can be targeted to activate differentiation of paediatric cancers.

Hyperactive MYC signalling via amplification of the MYCN proto-oncogene is a hallmark of neuroblastoma6 and drives aggressive disease with poor outcomes7,8,9. In the Th-MYCN genetically engineered mouse model, enforced MYCN expression in sympathoadrenal cells induces neuroblastomas10. The rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), is directly transcriptionally upregulated by MYCN11 and is often co-amplified12. Inhibition of ODC by difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of children with high-risk neuroblastoma5. Combined treatment strategies to enhance DFMO activity are therefore of great interest.

One potential such strategy is depletion of the ODC substrate ornithine. Ornithine can be derived from arginine via a single enzymatic step catalysed by arginase, or from proline and glutamine via two or three steps that converge on the enzyme ornithine aminotransferase (OAT)13. In early childhood, most ornithine comes from proline via OAT14,15. Since neuroblastomas arise in early childhood, they might similarly depend on OAT, which was recently implicated as a metabolic driver in pancreatic cancer through the provision of ornithine and thereby polyamines16.

We found that proline, whose catabolism can feed into ornithine via OAT, is strongly increased in MYCN-driven neuroblastoma. This was shown in three contexts: primary patient tumours exhibiting MYCN amplification (relative to unamplified tumours), xenografts induced from patient-derived neuroblastoma cell lines exhibiting high MYCN expression (relative to cell lines with low MYCN expression), and Th-MYCN genetically engineered mouse tumours (relative to normal organs of the mouse) (Fig. 1a,b, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). In the Th-MYCN model, proline content was also markedly higher in late tumours (those larger than 50 mm3) compared with early tumours (Extended Data Fig. 1f). Gene-expression analysis indicated that proline transport and de novo biosynthesis is upregulated in MYCN-amplified patient tumours and cell lines (Extended Data Fig. 2), which is of interest as recent work has highlighted the necessity of reductive proline biosynthesis17. Levels of ornithine and other upstream precursors were not consistently higher in these cells. Thus, we identified a large increase in proline in MYCN-driven neuroblastoma and propose proline as a candidate target for potential enhancement of neuroblastoma therapy.

Source data

As a complementary approach to identify metabolic targets, we first investigated the in vivo circulatory sources of proline and ornithine using infusion-based stable isotope tracing in the Th-MYCN model18,19,20. Tumour proline was derived from circulating proline and glutamine, reflecting proline acquisition from a combination of circulatory uptake and de novo biosynthesis (Fig. 1c). Unlike in previous studies in infants21,22, this proline was not converted to ornithine in substantial quantities in the neuroblastoma tumours. Examination of gene-expression data from primary tumours revealed that OAT expression is low in MYCN-driven neuroblastoma (Extended Data Fig. 2b), consistent with the need for an alternative ornithine source rather than intratumour synthesis from glutamine or proline. Isotope tracing confirmed the source to be circulating arginine and ornithine itself. Most circulating ornithine was derived from arginine (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 3) and to a lesser extent from dietary, but not circulating, proline (Fig. 1e). A large fraction of oral arginine was also converted to circulating proline, highlighting carbons being diverted from ornithine to proline synthesis by intestinal OAT activity (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Tumour ornithine was most strongly labelled from circulating ornithine, although it was also strongly labelled from circulating arginine. Quantitative modelling analysis of tumour ornithine sources revealed that circulating arginine feeds tumour ornithine mainly indirectly, after being converted to ornithine elsewhere in the body, and subsequent uptake of the resulting circulating ornithine by the tumour (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). The ultimate upstream source of most neuroblastoma ornithine under a standard diet is therefore arginine, highlighting arginine restriction as a potential complement to proline restriction and DFMO treatment for neuroblastoma therapy.

To test this, we introduced a proline- and arginine-free (ProArg-free) diet (Supplementary Table 2) in the Th-MYCN mouse model and assessed its effect on metabolic networks by in vivo tracing. The ProArg-free diet reduced circulating fluxes of proline, arginine, glutamine and ornithine (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f). Nonetheless, infusion-based tracing showed largely unchanged labelling of intratumoral polyamine-related metabolites, with uptake from circulation remaining the predominant source of ornithine (Extended Data Fig. 3g). This indicates that even under a diet depleted of its ornithine substrates, intratumoral OAT directionality is maintained with only minor local ornithine production in neuroblastoma (Extended Data Fig. 3f,h). By contrast, pre-circulatory intestinal conversion of dietary proline to ornithine via OAT doubled under the ProArg-free diet to support systemic ornithine levels (Extended Data Fig. 3i,j). Ornithine is then converted to polyamines locally in the tumours, as evidenced by the contribution to putrescine labelling, with increased labelling from ornithine upon a ProArg-free diet (Extended Data Fig. 3k) and lower contribution from circulating putrescine (Extended Data Fig. 3l). We therefore evaluated the anti-tumour effect of dietary substrate depletion of the two major amino acid precursors of ornithine (Fig. 1f) in combination with DFMO treatment.

Using the Th-MYCN model, we next examined the effect of combined dietary amino acid depletion (proline and/or arginine) with or without pharmacological ODC inhibition by DFMO (Fig. 2a). Mice fed the ProArg-free diet alone showed reduced neuroblastoma growth compared with control diet (CD), with no effect on tumour-free survival (Fig. 2b,c). As in previous studies, inhibition of polyamine biosynthesis by DFMO monotherapy extended survival23,24,25. In mice with prolonged survival, lethal tumour progression was observed after treatment cessation.

Notably, combining dietary proline and arginine removal with DFMO induced a marked survival benefit (Fig. 2b), decreased tumour growth (Fig. 2c) and increased time to detectable tumour (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). One-third of mice in the ProArg-free diet plus DFMO regimen had extended survival, with approximately 20% remaining tumour-free, as confirmed via necropsy. Although the ProArg-free diet caused a reduction in mouse weight, this did not affect survival and was not worsened by adding DFMO (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). The therapeutic effect of combining DFMO with dietary depletion of either proline or arginine alone was inferior to DFMO plus ProArg-free diet (Extended Data Fig. 4e–g). Even when delaying treatment initiation until pre-terminal tumour progression, we observed a significant reduction in tumour mass in the ProArg-free diet plus DFMO regimen, suggesting relevance for treatment of established tumours (Extended Data Fig. 4h,i). Despite the unfavourable metabolic environment, a higher immune cell infiltration and stromal component was observed in the ProArg-free, DFMO-treated tumours (Supplementary Fig. 1). In summary, the ODC inhibitor DFMO, which was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for neuroblastoma treatment, combined with a diet free of the non-essential amino acids arginine and proline, significantly augments anti-tumour activity with around 20% of treated mice remaining tumour-free 100 days beyond the end of therapy.

To reveal the metabolic reprogramming underlying this anti-tumour activity, we performed serum metabolomics (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 5a). Across the entire metabolome, the metabolite showing the most significant decrease in serum in response to the ProArg-free diet was ornithine, the crucial polyamine precursor that we sought to deplete. The next two most significantly decreased metabolites were proline and arginine themselves (Fig. 3b,c and Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). Other notable serum metabolite changes included an increase in glutamine and decreases in citrulline and the collagen breakdown product hydroxyproline (Fig. 3b,c and Extended Data Fig. 5c). Arginine, proline and ornithine were also significantly decreased in tumours following different treatment durations, but to a lesser extent than in serum (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). The depletion of intratumoral ornithine manifested despite the increase in tumour glutamine, which gives rise to ornithine in other cancers via OAT16.

Targeted liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) measurements of tumour polyamines revealed that DFMO treatment decreased putrescine, the direct product of ornithine decarboxylation by ODC, and its derivatives such as spermidine. The ProArg-free diet potentiated the DFMO effect to further decrease polyamine levels, achieving more than tenfold reduction in spermidine compared with CD and more than twofold reduction compared with DFMO monotherapy (Fig. 3e). N8-acetylspermidine and N-acetyl-putrescine were also decreased by a ProArg-free diet plus DFMO, consistent with reduced catabolic flux (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 5f). Combined dietary intervention with DFMO treatment resulted in superior spermidine depletion compared with co-treatment with the polyamine uptake inhibitor AMXT150124 (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 5g), highlighting the primacy of intratumoral polyamine synthesis. Reducing proline or arginine substrate intake individually was insufficient to enhance polyamine depletion beyond DFMO monotherapy (Extended Data Fig. 5h,i). The dependency on intracellular polyamine biosynthesis of neuroblastoma via ODC and its substrates was further confirmed in an ex vivo neuroblastoma cell model, with depletion of proline and arginine from the medium synergizing when ODC was inhibited (DFMO) or downregulated (via short hairpin RNA (shRNA)) (Supplementary Fig. 2). Growth rescue was observed from natural and synthetic polyamines across neuroblastoma lines upon polyamine biosynthesis inhibition by DFMO or combined with proline and arginine depletion medium (Supplementary Fig. 2h–j). Thus, dual dietary amino acid restriction depletes the key polyamine precursor ornithine and, combined with DFMO, leads to enhanced tumour polyamine depletion.

Polyamines stimulate translation and cell growth26. Arginine and proline also feed directly into translation as proteinogenic amino acids. Combining proline and arginine depletion with DFMO in vitro enhanced translation inhibition by DFMO (Supplementary Fig. 3a–c). To disentangle the amino acid and polyamine effects of the ProArg-free diet and DFMO on translation, we carried out ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq)27 (Fig. 4a; quality control presented in Supplementary Fig. 3d–h). This approach identifies transcriptome-wide mRNA loading with ribosomes and which codons are decoded by ribosomes at the moment of cell lysis. Increased ribosome density can indicate sites of stalled translation, due either to uncharged tRNAs or a defect in the translation machinery. With ProArg-free diet, DFMO or ProArg-free diet plus DFMO, ribosome occupancy was shifted slightly towards the start codon and decreased at early elongation of the protein-encoding transcript. Exclusively under ProArg-free diet plus DFMO treatment, ribosomes accumulated at stop codons, indicating defective ribosome release (Supplementary Fig. 3i,j). Such elongation and termination defects have been reported in cell models functionally deficient in eIF5A28, a translation factor that is post-translationally modified by the polyamine spermidine27,29,30,31. As this suggested in vivo eIF5A dysfunction, we probed eIF5A hypusination status (that is, spermidine modification of eIF5A) across treatment groups. Whereas all tumours from the CD and ProArg-free groups without drug demonstrated complete eIF5A hypusination, reflecting sufficient spermidine for this purpose, two out of eight tumours treated with DFMO alone and five out of eight tumours from the ProArg-free diet plus DFMO group had reduced eIF5A hypusination and increased K47 eIF5A acetylation, indicative of attenuated hypusination. We also observed modestly reduced hypusination in these tumours using hypusine-specific antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 6a–e).

In addition to its global functions, hypusinated eIF5A has been implicated in facilitating peptide bond formation involving repetitive instances of the amino acid proline, termed polyproline tracts. Owing to its reactive amine localized within a ring structure, proline is a poor peptidyl acceptor32. We thus evaluated relative ribosome occupancy at polyproline tracts, with high occupancy indicating slow decoding by ribosomes, due either to uncharged proline tRNA or to eIF5A deficiency. Increased occupancy was observed at polyproline tracts in ProArg-free diet plus DFMO-treated tumours, but not at proline codons with ProArg-free diet alone (Fig. 4b). Collectively, these data indicate that the combined ProArg-free diet and DFMO therapy impairs translation beyond tumour amino acid levels and tRNA charging by depleting spermidine to levels low enough to also impair eIF5A hypusination in more than half of the tumours.

As the role of polyamine levels in ribosomal decoding at codon resolution is currently unknown, we next sought to differentiate its effects from eIF5A hypusination-related roles in translational reprogramming. Further analysis of the Ribo-seq data revealed a surprising aspect of the stalling at polyproline tracts induced by combined ProArg-free diet and DFMO therapy: ribosome stalling was observed predominantly at only one of the four proline codons (CCA). There was less stalling at CCC and no stalling at CCG or CCT. This indicated an additional unanticipated level of translation regulation at the codon, rather than the amino acid level. Extending the analysis to all proline codons (that is, including those that were not in polyproline tracts) revealed the same phenomenon: selected stalling at CCA codons (Fig. 4c). This phenotype contrasts with the genetic modulation of eIF5A hypusination, which preserves normal polyamine levels, yet affects all proline codons (Extended Data Fig. 6f,g). Conversely, supplementing neuroblastoma cell lysates with polyamines in an in vitro translation assay preferentially facilitated the translation of CCA codons over CCG codons (Extended Data Fig. 6h,i). Together, these results highlight an effect of polyamine depletion that is not amino acid-specific or recapitulated by genetic ablation of hypusination as the dominant driver of codon-specific translational reprogramming under ProArg-free diet plus DFMO treatment.

We next assessed the global effect of combined ProArg-free diet plus DFMO treatment across individual codons at high resolution. Across all amino acids, ribosome pausing was highly dependent on the codon type (as opposed to amino acid identity). When sorting individual codons by relative occupancy, a primary factor determining translation speed was the nucleotide at the third position. Whereas codons with adenosine in the third position showed increased occupancy (a proxy for stalling) in ProArg-free diet plus DFMO-treated tumours, occupancy at codons with guanosine in the third position was markedly decreased (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 6j). The same phenotype, with a reduced effect size, was shown for the DFMO monotherapy group, suggesting a previously unknown role of polyamines (rather than low arginine or proline) in the decoding of codons with adenosine at the third position (also referred to as the ‘wobble' position) (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 6k–n). Similarly, at the global level this phenotype was not identified following genetic or pharmacological inhibition of hypusination (Supplementary Fig. 4).

On the contrary, ribosome pausing appeared to be driven by disrupted codon–anticodon interactions with tRNAs exhibiting complex biochemical modifications at the anticodon wobble base position (tRNA base 34) of all highly paused codons with adenosine in the third position, as well as the two highly paused codons with thymidine in the third position (Fig. 4d). This was further supported by the pausing phenotype affecting all three ribosome sites (A, P and E; Extended Data Fig. 6j). Whereas this was mostly independent of the tRNA modification status at position 34, the ProArg-free diet itself increased queuosine-related modifications, putatively further adding to the polyamine induced codon-specific translation imbalance (Supplementary Fig. 5a–d). Although interactions of polyamines with ribosomes and tRNAs have been reported33,34 and documented to stimulate translation in vitro35, to our knowledge, this codon resolution phenotype has not previously been described (Fig. 4e).

To better understand the phenotypic consequences induced by this specific translation defect, we integrated RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), Ribo-seq and proteomics data (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 6a–d). The main driver of transcriptional changes was DFMO. The ProArg-free diet itself induced only minor such changes, and transcriptional changes strongly overlapped between DFMO alone and the combined ProArg-free diet plus DFMO treatment. By contrast, Ribo-seq and proteomics revealed distinct changes in tumours under combined ProArg-free diet plus DFMO therapy. The effect was independent of proline or polyproline abundance in the proteins (Supplementary Fig. 6e–h), and instead correlated with genes that were enriched in codons with adenosine in the third position.

Notably, upon combined ProArg-free diet plus DFMO treatment, gene sets linked to neuronal differentiation and neuronal cell identity were the most upregulated at the protein level. By contrast, ‘cell cycle' was the most downregulated gene set, despite exhibiting unchanged RNA expression (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 7a). We next assessed whether the slow translation of codons with adenosine at the third position relates to proteome reprogramming. Indeed the cell cycle gene set contained a higher frequency of codons with adenosine in the third position that were affected by ribosome pausing, compared with the average for the exome. Exome-wide, pathways associated with cell cycle programmes were the most enriched in codons with adenosine in the third position36. Neuronal differentiation-associated gene sets were at the opposite end of the spectrum, with the guanosine content showing limited variation in both gene sets (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 7b–d). A higher fraction of codons with adenosine in the third position within a pathway was linked with a lower protein fold change or gene set enrichment (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 7e).

Beyond the general reduction of cell cycle proteins, four mitosis-related proteins stood out with the strongest downregulation at the protein level under combined ProArg-free diet plus DFMO treatment (Extended Data Fig. 7f,g). All four showed at least fourfold downregulation at the protein level, without changes in gene expression (Fig. 5d), in contrast to the regulation in neuronal proteins (Extended Data Fig. 7h,i). Itgb3bp, encoding CENPR, the most affected protein, showed a remarkably shifted distribution in codon preference, with 38.6% of codons having adenosine in the third position, compared with 18.8% across all protein-coding transcripts (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 7j,k). The ribosome distribution along the CENPR coding sequence confirmed preferential pausing at codons with adenosine in the third position upon ProArg-free diet plus DFMO treatment, as indicated by an increased ribosomal pausing sum at codons with adenosine in the third position and reduced pausing at those with guanosine in the third position (Extended Data Fig. 7l–n). Similar pausing was observed for CEP57 and KIF2C, and the pausing sum correlated to the levels of the most regulated proteins across the two gene sets (Extended Data Fig. 7o,p). Expression of cell cycle proteins was increased in MYCN-amplified tumours from human patients and correlated to high tumour stage (Extended Data Fig. 8a–c). Depleting polyamine levels independently of DFMO by ODC knockdown depleted cell cycle protein levels and induced growth defects characterized by cell cycle arrest (Extended Data Fig. 8d–m). Conversely, external supplementation of polyamines restored cell growth and CENPR levels following enhanced polyamine depletion by DFMO with proline- and arginine-reduced medium. This rescue was independent of hypusination status, as indicated by sustained rescue upon Dhps knockdown, preventing spermidine-dependent post-translational modification of eIF5a (Extended Data Fig. 8n). Thus, polyamine depletion by combined ProArg-free diet and DFMO treatment induces ribosome stalling at codons with adenosine in the third position. Owing to the selective enrichment of these codons cell cycle genes and their depletion in differentiation genes, this effect of ProArg-free diet and DFMO treatment reprogrammes the proteome in a manner that favours differentiation.

We hypothesized that the shift away from cell cycle proteins towards neuronal differentiation proteins is likely to reprogramme neuroblastoma tumours in a manner that slows proliferation and induces differentiation. Ki67 staining confirmed a decrease in actively cycling cells under ProArg-free diet plus DFMO treatment (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Furthermore, cell growth activation signatures including MYC and E2F targets were impaired (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig. 9b).

Given the essential role of MYCN in the development and maintenance of neuroblastoma and its positive feedback loop with ODC1 and eIF5A37, we explored whether the loss of MYC targets indicates a disruption of the core oncogenic regulatory circuit38,39,40. Both MYCN mRNA expression and MYCN protein were preferentially downregulated in tumours under combined ProArg-free diet plus DFMO treatment (Fig. 6b and Extended Data Fig. 9c). Other core transcription factors were also suppressed, supporting a broad disruption of the MYCN-driven core regulatory circuit (Extended Data Fig. 9d,e). Despite MYCN downregulation, its transcriptional targets in the polyamine pathway remained unchanged or were upregulated in response to polyamine depletion in vivo (Extended Data Fig. 9f–h) or pharmacological inhibition in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 9i). Further, TP53 expression41 remained unaffected on the protein or ribosome level (Extended Data Fig. 9j,k). On the mechanistic level, modulating MYC or MYCN activity by genetic or pharmacological means showed no pausing of ribosomes at codons with adenosine in the third position, suggesting a MYC-independent translation phenotype as a driver (Supplementary Fig. 7a–h). Evaluating tumour differentiation status according to clinical pathological criteria showed that tumours in the CD and ProArg-free groups were uniformly undifferentiated (<5% cytologic differentiated with absent neuropil). By contrast, we observed a strong differentiation phenotype upon polyamine-depleting treatment, with one-third of CD plus DFMO-treated tumours being differentiated (more than 5% cytologic differentiated with absent neuropil) and two thirds of ProArg-free diet plus DFMO-treated tumours differentiating or partially differentiating with abundant neuropil (a feature of neural differentiation; Fig. 6c and Extended Data Fig. 10a). Thus, combining a ProArg-free diet with DFMO therapy led to marked reductions in polyamines, inducing selective translation defects that suppressed tumour cell proliferation and induced tumour differentiation (Fig. 6d).

The therapeutic relevance of combining dietary amino acid depletion with DFMO was further emphasized in a model using established patient-derived neuroblastoma cell line xenografts in mice (Extended Data Fig. 10b–e). Replicating the genetic model, long-term survival beyond 100 days and apparent cures were observed in one-quarter of the ProArg-free diet plus DFMO-treated mice and treatment was well tolerated without weight changes (Extended Data Fig. 10f,g). Whereas on the gene-expression level MYCN and ODC1 were unchanged, MYCN protein expression was decreased independently of ODC1 (Extended Data Fig. 10h,i). Mechanistically decreased proliferation was confirmed by histology, along with a pro-differentiation phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 10j,k), highlighting the role of enhanced polyamine depletion inducing differentiation for treatment of neuroblastoma.

Here we find that neuroblastoma, a highly malignant childhood cancer, is vulnerable to polyamine depletion achieved by the combination of a diet free of proline and arginine to deplete the polyamine precursor ornithine, and pharmacological inhibition of ODC, the committed step of polyamine synthesis, with high-dose DFMO. The diet plus drug combination markedly enhanced polyamine depletion and exerted a strong anti-cancer effect in a highly lethal transgenic mouse neuroblastoma model, and a human neuroblastoma mouse xenograft model, with durable complete responses in both.

Use of defined diet and drug combinations is emerging as a clinically viable strategy for cancer treatment42,43. Ketogenic diet can synergize with classical chemotherapy and targeted agents, and can be achieved, with proper support, by patients making careful food choices44,45,46 (NCT05300048 and NCT01535911). Diets lacking certain amino acids require laboratory formulation, but show acceptable taste and desired metabolic effects in humans, and are also entering cancer efficacy trials47,48 (NCT05078775). Such diets show effects resembling enzyme-based treatments that catabolize particular amino acids, such as asparaginase, a long-standing standard of care for treating childhood leukaemias49. In some cases, however, diets have important advantages. For example, dietary arginine depletion decreases both arginine and ornithine, whereas arginase therapy50 depletes arginine by converting it into the polyamine precursor ornithine. Conversely, refeeding has been shown to induce polyamine biosynthesis in intestinal stem cells, triggering tumorigenicity51. Thus, preventing intestinal interconversion of substrates through a dietary approach or alternative interventions suitable for achieving ornithine depletion offer an effective combination with DFMO to deplete polyamines.

Arrested cellular differentiation by retained embryonal gene-expression circuits is a hallmark of paediatric cancers52,53. Neuroblastoma is a prime example, with hyperactive MYCN driving embryonal programmes38,40,54,55. Induction of differentiation through transcriptional reprogramming is a validated therapeutic strategy, exemplified by the nuclear hormone receptor agonist retinoic acid56,57. Here we provide evidence for the feasibility of triggering differentiation in paediatric cancers through proteome reprogramming. Specifically, we find that polyamine depletion promotes the translation of pro-differentiation proteins and suppresses that of cell cycle proteins, leading to neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma. Whether similar benefits could be achieved in other MYC-driven cancers merits investigation.

The selective effect of polyamine depletion on translation of certain genes was unexpected, and was not driven by genetic ablation of eIF5A hypusination. The underlying biochemistry involves polyamine deficiency shifting codon optimality by impairing translation of codons with adenosine at the wobble base by position 34-modified tRNAs, and codons being thus preferentially enriched (or depleted) in different gene sets. This mechanism raises the possibility that codon usage has evolved in tandem with metabolism, such that metabolic limitation acts on translation of specific codons to rewire the proteome. Specifically, our data point to polyamine depletion suppressing proliferation and promoting differentiation via utilization of codons with adenosine in the third position. This programme may have evolved to support proper developmental decisions, but using diet and pharmacology, it has therapeutic potential in treating neuroblastoma.

Flash-frozen primary neuroblastoma tumour samples were provided by the Children's Oncology Group (COG) under study number ANBL16B2 Q. International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification histologic parameters, MYCN amplification status, age and stage for every patient was obtained centrally via the COG Statistics and Data Center. Tumour cell content of samples was confirmed over 80% percent. Patient and tumour characteristics are given in Supplementary Table 1. Water-soluble metabolites were extracted and analysed as described below.

Animal studies followed protocols approved by Princeton University and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. For xenografts used for metabolomics, cancer cell lines were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.01% insulin/transferrin solution. Cell lines were provided by the COG Cell Culture Repository: LA-N-5, SMS-SAN, CHLA-90 and SK-N-SH. All cell lines repeatedly tested negative for Mycoplasma. Subcutaneous xenografts were established on 6-week-old female CD1-nu mice by injection of 100 μl 50/50 RPMI/Matrigel solution containing 106 cells of the respective cell line. For xenografts used in therapeutic trials, tumours were established on 4- to 6-week-old female NCr-nu mice (Charles River) by injection of 100 μl 50/50 RPMI/Matrigel solution containing 3 × 106 IMR5 cells (MYCN amplified, ALK amplified). Mice were randomized to specific treatment when tumours were ≥200 mm3. Mice were sacrificed when tumours were 2,000 mm3. Tumour mass was inferred using tumour volume using volume to mass of xenograft conversion described in McLean et al.58. The Th-MYCN mouse model was used to investigate the functional changes of metabolism driven by MYCN. 129×1/SvJ mice transgenic for the Th-MYCN construct10 were originally obtained from B. Weiss. Th-MYCN hemizygous mice were bred and litters randomized to assigned therapy. Mice were genotyped from tail-snip-isolated DNA using quantitative PCR23 and only transgene-homozygous mice (Th-MYCN+/+) were included in these studies. In this model, MYCN expression is targeted to the mouse neural crest under the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter, recapitulating hallmark features of human neuroblastoma. Tumours arise at autochthonous sites in an immunocompetent host with histologic, genomic, and immune similarities to human neuroblastoma59,60. Tumours are fully penetrant with onset prior to day 14 in >75% based on histologic audits61 and are lethal by 7 weeks.

Mice were maintained with 12 h of dark daily (18:00 to 06:00). The rodent holding rooms were maintained at a temperature range of 18.9 °C–25.6 °C with an ideal setpoint of 22.2 °C. The humidity was maintained within a range of 30–70% with an ideal setpoint of 50%.

Tissues and tumours were collected from mice in fed state and immediately clamped into liquid nitrogen using Wollenberger clamp. All tissues were stored in −80 °C. Frozen tissues were transferred to 2 ml Eppendorf tubes, which were precooled on dry ice, and then pulverized using Cyromill. The resulting tissue powder was weighed (around 10 mg) and mixed well by vortexing in extraction buffer (40 μl extraction buffer per mg tissue). The extraction solution was neutralized with NH4HCO3 as above and centrifuged in a microfuge at maximum speed for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was transferred to LC–MS vials for analysis. Blood samples were drawn from mouse tail veins using a microvette and kept on ice. After centrifugation (10 min, benchtop microfuge maximum speed, 4 °C), serum was collected in a 1.5 ml tube and stored at −80 °C. Five microlitres of serum were mixed with 200 μl extraction buffer (40:40:20 acetonitrile: methanol: water with 0.5% formic acid) and neutralized with 15% NH4HCO3. After centrifugation (30 min, benchtop microfuge maximum speed, 4 °C), supernatant was transferred to LC–MS vials for analysis.

Metabolomics was performed on the following systems. A quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive, Thermo Fisher Scientific), operating in positive or negative mode was coupled to hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) via electrospray ionization18. Scans were performed from m/z 70 to 1,000 at 1 Hz and 140,000 resolution. Liquid chromatography separation was on a XBridge BEH Amide column using a gradient of solvent A (20 mM ammonium acetate, 20 mM ammounium hydroxide in 95:5 water:acetonitrile, pH 9.45) and solvent B (acetonitrile). Flow rate was 150 μl min−1. The liquid chromatography gradient was: 0 min, 85% B; 2 min, 85% B; 3 min, 80% B; 5 min, 80% B; 6 min, 75% B; 7 min, 75% B; 8 min, 70% B; 9 min, 70% B; 10 min, 50% B; 12 min, 50% B; 13 min, 25% B; 16 min, 25% B; 18 min, 0% B; 23 min, 0% B; 24 min, 85% B. Autosampler temperature was 5 °C, and injection volume was 5–10 μl. Complementary, primary samples analysed on an Exactive (Thermo Fisher Scientifc) operating in negative ion mode62. Liquid chromatography separation was achieved on a Synergy Hydro-RP column (100 mm × 2 mm, 2.5 μm particle size, Phenomenex), using reversed-phase chromatography with the ion pairing agent tributylamine in the aqueous mobile phase to enhance retention and separation. An adaptive scan range was used with an m/z from 85–1,000. Resolution was 100,000 at 1 Hz. The total run time was 25 min with a flow rate at 200 μl min−1. Solvent A is 97:3 water/methanol with 10 mM tributylamine and 15 mM acetic acid; solvent B is methanol. The gradient is 0 min, 0% B; 2.5 min, 0% B; 5 min, 20% B; 7.5 min, 20% B; 13 min, 55% B; 15.5 min, 95% B; 18.5 min, 95% B; 19 min, 0% B; 25 min, 0% B.

Metabolomics data analysis was performed using ElMaven software (https://github.com/ElucidataInc/ElMaven). For labelling experiments, correction for natural abundance of 13C was performed using Accucor (https://github.com/XiaoyangSu/AccuCor).

Th-MYCN mice were housed in groups and food was supplied without restriction to guarantee sufficient supply. Mice weights were recorded every day. During experiments mice were freely moving and tissues and serum were analysed following the above-mentioned method. Tumour and inter organ cooperativity in proline, arginine and ornithine biosynthesis was analysed on the whole-body level. The mice were on normal light cycle (06:00–18:00). In vivo infusion was performed on 6- to 7-week-old normal Th-MYCN mice pre-catheterized in the right jugular vein and 13C metabolite tracers were infused for 2.5–5 h to achieve isotopic pseudo-steady state. The mouse infusion setup included a tether and swivel system, connecting to the button pre-implanted under the back skin of mice. Mice were fasted from 09:00 to 14:00 and infused from 14:00 to 16:30. Tracers were dissolved in saline and infused via the catheter at a constant rate (0.1 μl min−1 per g mouse weight) using a Just infusion Syringe Pump. One-hundred millimolar [U-13C]glutamine was dissolved and infused for 2.5 h, 40 mM [U-13C]arginine was infused for 5 h, 200 mM [U-13C]glucose was infused for 5 h, 10 mM [U-13C]proline for was infused 5 h and 5 mM [U-13C]ornithine was infused for 5 h. At the end of infusion, mice were dissected and tissues were clamped in aluminium foil and stored in liquid nitrogen.

ArgPro-free diet was purchased from TestDiet Baker (1812426 (5CC7) for CD, 1816284-203 (5WYF) for ProArg-free diet, 1819015-203 (5WZ3) for arginine-free diet and 1816284-203 (5BDL) for proline-free diet). Detailed makeup is given in Supplementary Table 2. The ODC inhibitor, DFMO, was obtained from P. Woster. DFMO was dissolved in drinking water and supplied to mice ad libitum at a dose of 1% in the drinking water. Survival end point: only Th-MYCN+/+ mice were randomized. DFMO was provided to mothers on day 1 (partially transmitted to pups in breastmilk) and then directly to pups at day 28 of life, post-weaning; diet change was started at day 21 of life, per treatment assignment. Mice were weighed and assessed for tumour growth and symptoms, at least thrice weekly by a single experienced animal technician. Mice were euthanized at pre-defined humane endpoints related to overall health or tumour burden (hunching, immobility, hindlimb paresis, weight loss or respiratory distress). An additional ‘late start' trial was done with Th-MYCN+/+ mice enrolled at the time of a palpable progressing abdominal tumour (typically day of life 35–50), randomized to diet and/or DFMO as above, and taken down for tumour mass after 14 days of therapy, sooner if humane endpoints were reached. For metabolomics studies. Th-MYCN+/+ mice were treated as above, serum was obtained at day 43 (±2 days) and tumours and organs were collected at that time if tumour was present or delayed to the earliest time tumour became palpable. Time to tumour collection depended on the treatment group. In order to ensure homogenous timing of metabolic tumour collection, Th-MYCN+/+ mice ProArg-free diet plus DFMO had therapy delayed to day 28.

Mice bearing established IMR5 xenografts at ≥200 mm3 were randomized to diets and/or DFMO as above. Mice were weighed and assessed for tumour volume and symptoms, at least thrice weekly. End point: mice were euthanized when tumour volume >2 cm3 using calipers measurements and assuming an ellipsoid volume.

Polyamine concentrations and amino acids in the single-amino-acid trials (Pro-free and Arg-free) were quantified using the AccQ-Tag fluorescence dye (Waters) as described63. Derivatives were separated on an Acquity BEH C18 column (150 mm×2.1 mm, 1.7 μm, Waters) by reverse phase UPLC (Acquity H-class UPLC system, Acquity FLR detector, Waters). The column was equilibrated with buffer A (140 mM sodium acetate pH 6.3, 7 mM triethanolamine) at a flow rate of 0.45 ml min−1 and heated at 42 °C. Pure acetonitrile served as buffer B. The gradient was produced by the following concentration changes: 1 min 8% B, 7 min 9% B, 7.3 min 15% B, 12.2 min 18% B, 13.1 min 41% B, 15.1 min 80% B, hold for 2.2 min, and return to 8% B in 1.7 min. Chromatograms were recorded and processed with the Empower3 software (Waters). For acetylated polyamines a MS/MS method was used. In brief, a Waters Acquity I-class Plus UPLC system (Binary Solvent Manager, thermostatic Column Manager and FTN Sample Manager) (Waters) coupled to an QTRAP 6500+ (Sciex) mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization (ESI) source was used. Data acquisition was performed with Analyst (Sciex), and data quantification was performed with the SciexOS software suite (Sciex). Chromatography was made on an Acquity HSS T3 column (150 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm, Waters) kept at 20 °C and a flow rate of 0.3 ml min−1. Eluent A consisted of water with 0.1% formic acid and eluent B in acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. Gradient elution consisted in changing %B as follows: 0–1 min 0%; 5 min 20%; 5.5–7.5 min 100%, and 8–10 min 0%. The ion source settings were as follow: curtain gas: 30 psi; collision gas: low; ion spray: 4,500 V; source temperature: 500 °C; ion source gas 1: 40 (GS1) and ion source gas 2: 50 (GS2). All compounds were measured in positive electrospray ion mode. To ensure comparability of amino acid levels the signal intensity was scaled based on samples that were in parallel analysed by LC–MS.

For fate tracing of 13C-labelled amino acids into polyamines an ice-cold extraction solvent consisting of 0.1 M HCl plus 10 μM Norleucine (internal standard) was added as follows: 45 μl for 5 μl of serum and 300 μl for 20–30 mg of mouse tissue. After a 15-min incubation on ice, samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were then labelled with the fluorescence dye AccQ-Tag (Waters) according to the manufacturer's protocol, with a modification for serum samples where the final volume was adjusted to 120 μl instead of 500 μl. The method used an I-class UPLC system coupled to a QTRAP 6500+ mass spectrometry system (AB SCIEX) with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. The derivatives were separated using an Acquity HSS T3 column (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.8 µm, Waters) maintained at 40 °C. The mobile phases were: A, 0.1% formic acid in water; and B, 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive-ion mode with an ion spray voltage of 5,500 V, a source temperature of 550 °C, and GS1 and GS2 set at 70. Data acquisition was performed using Analyst 1.7.2 (AB SCIEX).

Polyamine concentration were compared to AMXT1501 treated Th-MYCN tumours from Gamble et al.24.

Metabolomics data for 180 cancer cell lines was obtained from Cherkaoui et al.64. Associations between metabolite levels in core metabolic pathways and MYCN transcriptional activity were obtained from https://cancer-metabolomics.azurewebsites.net/page2.

Gene-expression profiles of 649 neuroblastoma tumours65 were obtained from R2 (R2 Genomics Analysis and Visualization Platform; http://r2.amc.nl). Differential expression analysis between MYCN amplification status was performed using the Bioconductor package limma66 (v.3.40.6).

Expression profiles of 39 neuroblastoma cell lines67 were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus. Differential analysis was performed using the Bioconductor package limma (v.3.40.6) and by comparing MYCN amplification status provided in the study. Data from the CCLE68 was taken from the release from the second quarter of 2021 (21Q2).

Total RNA was isolated from the same extracts that were used to obtain mRNA protected fragments (RPFs) (‘Ribo-seq of Th-MYCN tumours'). Three volumes of QIAzol (Qiagen, 79306) were added to 80 μl of cell extracts, mixed thoroughly and proceed to RNA purification with Direct-Zol RNA Mini Prep Plus kit. RNA were sent to Genomic Platform (UNIGE) for stranded mRNA libraries preparation. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000, SR 100 bp, 10 libraries in 1 pool.

Mouse tumours were mechanically disrupted in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in a lysis buffer (LB, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 25 U ml−1 Turbo DNase I, 1 mM DTT, 100 μg ml−1 cycloheximide, and protease inhibitors) 3 ml of LB per 1 g of tissue. To obtain ribosome footprints 0.12 ml of total extracts containing 300 μg of total RNA were treated with RNAse I (Epicentre) (25 U per mg of total RNA), for 45 min at 20 °C with slow agitation. 10 ml SUPERaseIn RNase inhibitor was added to stop nuclease digestion. Monosomes were isolated using S-400 columns. For isolation of RPFs, 3 volumes of QIAzol were added to the S-400 eluate, mixed thoroughly and proceed to RNA purification with Direct-Zol RNA Mini Prep Plus kit.

RPF libraries were prepared as described69,70. In brief, RPFs (25–34 nucleotides) were size-selected by electrophoresis using 15% TBE–Urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and two RNA markers, 25-mer (5′-AUGUACACGGAGUCGAGCACCCGCA-3′) and 34-mer (5′-AUGUACACGGAGUCGAGCACCCGCAACGCGAAUG-3′). After dephosphorylation with T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (NEB, M0201S) the adapter Linker-1 (5′-rAppCTGTAGGCACCATCAAT/3ddC/-3′) was ligated to the 3′ end of the RPF using T4 RNA Ligase 2. Ligated products were purified using 10% TBE–Urea PAGE. Ribosomal RNA was subtracted using RiboCop rRNA Depletion Kit V2 H/M/R. The adapter Linker-1 was used for priming reverse transcription with the reverse transcription primer Ni-Ni-9 (5′-AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGTAGATCTCGGTGGTCGC5CACTCA5TTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTATTGATGGTGCCTACAG-3′) using ProtoScript II Reverse Transcriptase. Reverse transcription products were purified using 10% TBE–Urea PAGE. The cDNA was circularized with CircLigase II ssDNA Ligase. The final libraries were generated by PCR using forward index primer NI-N-2 (5′-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC-3′) and one of the reverse index primers. Amplified libraries were purified using 8% TBE-PAGE and analysed by Qubit and TapeStation. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000, SR 100 bp, 4 libraries in 1 pool.

Fastq files were adaptor stripped using cutadapt with a minimum length of 15 and a quality cut-off of 2 (parameters: -a CTGTAGGCACCATCAAT –minimum-length = 15 –quality-cutoff = 2). Resulting reads were mapped, using default parameters, with HISAT271, using a GRCm38, release 101 genome and index. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq272, using a GRCm38, release 101 genome and index.

Fastq files were adaptor stripped using cutadapt. Only trimmed reads were retained, with a minimum length of 15 and a quality cut-off of 2 (parameters: -a CTGTAGGCACCATCAAT – trimmed-only –minimum-length = 15 –quality-cutoff = 2). Histograms were produced of ribosome footprint lengths and reads were retained if the trimmed size was 28 or 29 nucleotides. Resulting reads were mapped, using default parameters, with HISAT271 using a GRCm38, release 101 genome and index and were removed if they mapped to rRNA or tRNA according to GRCm38 RepeatMasker definitions from UCSC. A full set of transcripts and coding sequence (CDS) sequences for Ensembl release 101 was then established. Only canonical transcripts (defined by known canonical table, downloaded from UCSC) were retained with their corresponding CDS. Reads were then mapped to the canonical transcriptome with bowtie2 using default parameters.

The P-site position of each read was predicted by riboWaltz73 and confirmed by inspection. Counts were made by aggregating P-sites overlapping with the CDS and P-sites per kilobase million (PPKMs) were then generated through normalizing by CDS length and total counts for the sample. Differential expression and translational efficiency analysis was performed using DESeq272. All metagenes, stalling and ribosome dwelling occupancy (RDO) analyses are carried out on a subset of expressed canonical transcripts which had PPKM values greater than 1 across all samples (10,366 total). Within these, P-site depths per nucleotide were normalized to the mean value in their respective CDS. For metagenes around codon types, the mean of these normalized values is taken for each codon within 90 nucleotides of every instance of that codon. For RDO calculation for a given type of codon, the mean of these normalized values is taken over all instances of that codon, then these are compared using a log2-transformed fold change ratio between conditions. To assess relative pausing, P-site depths normalized to the CDS mean were compared at each codon position in the CDS. A value of 1 was added to these normalized depths and a log2-transformed fold change ratio was taken pairwise between conditions. To compare effects of different codon ending bases, the resulting values were separated by the ending base of each codon and plotted across their respective positions in the CDS. The relative pausing sum for each ending A, T, G or C is then the sum of these values for every codon containing the respective ending codon across the CDS. The fraction of nucleotides at ending codons were evaluated from extracting the codons for the CDS of each gene using GRCm38, release 101. Pathway level fractions were computed using the average of each gene contained in the pathway.

To inhibit hypusination, cells were treated with 6.25 μM of the DHPS inhibitor GC7 (MedChemExpress) for 5 days. For MYCN inhibition, cells were treated with 5 μM MYCi975 (Selleckchem) for 4 days. Western blot analysis was performed to assess the efficacy of the inhibition. Following the respective treatment periods, cells were incubated with 100 μg ml−1 cycloheximide (Sigma) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed once with PBS containing 100 μg ml−1 cycloheximide, then trypsinized using a solution containing 100 μg ml−1 cycloheximide for 1 min at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and washed with cold PBS containing 100 μg ml−1 cycloheximide. IMR5 cells were disrupted in a lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1 mg ml−1 heparin, 25 U ml−1 Turbo DNase I (Roche, 04716728001), 1 mM DTT, 100 μg ml−1 cycloheximide (Sigma, C7698) and protease inhibitors (Roche, 04693132001). To obtain ribosome footprints 80 μl of lysates containing 150 g of total RNAs were treated with RNAse I (Ambion, AM2295) (250 U per mg of total RNA), for 60 min at 20°С with gentle agitation. Four microlitres SUPERaseIn RNase inhibitor (Ambion, AM2694) was added to stop nuclease digestion. Monosomes were isolated using S-400 columns (Cytiva, 27514001). Samples were then processed using Ribo-seq as described above.

Ribo-seq data from lymphoma cells with shRNAs targeting Renilla (sh-contl), Eif5a or Dhps were taken from Nakanishi et al.29. Raw data were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession GSE190670 and were processed using Ribo-seq analysis as described above.

Reprocessed and reanalysed data were from Elkon et al.74. Raw data were downloaded from GEO GSE66927 and were processed using Ribo-seq analysis as described above.

Reprocessed and reanalysed data from Volegova et al.75. Raw data were downloaded from GEO accession GSE261760 and were processed using Ribo-seq analysis as described above.

IMR5 cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% dialysed FBS (Gibco) and seeded into 384-well plates. Stock solutions of arginine, proline, DFMO and GC7 were dispensed into the 384-well plates using the Echo 650 (Beckmann Coulter) liquid handler in a concentration-dependent manner. The impact of varying proline and arginine concentration was assessed using RPMI free of arginine and proline and supplemented with 0%, 1%, 5%, 30%, 50% and 100% of standard RPMI levels of proline (174 μM) and arginine (1,149 μM). For polyamine supplementation, putrescine, spermidine or 1-methyl-spermidine (BenchChem), were supplemented in the respective concentrations as described above along with 1 mM aminoguanidine (Sigma-Aldrich). Additional rescue experiments were performed in different neuroblastoma cell backgrounds (SHEP, SKNBE2 and SHSY5Y). For quantification cells were then stained with 10 μM Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) and 1 μg ml−1 propidium iodide (Invitrogen) for 15 min at 37 °C/5% CO2. Fluorescent signals were captured and analysed at different time points using the Perkin-Elmer Operetta system to generate growth curve.

Lentiviral particles were produced in HEK293 cells by co-transfection of lentiviral packaging plasmids pCMV-VSV-G and pPAX2 (Addgene) with pRSIT-U6Tet-shTarget-PGK-TetRep-2A-TagGFP2-2A-Puro (Cellecta) expressing the desired shRNAs using 25 kDa linear polyethylenimine (Polysciences). Viral supernatants were collected 48 h post-transfection. IMR5 cells were transduced with viral supernatants containing 4 μg ml−1 polybrene (Sigma) for 48 h. Cells were selected with 2 μg ml−1 puromycin (Gibco) 48 h post-transduction. 50 ng ml−1 doxycycline (Sigma) was used for at least 24 h to induce shRNA expression. The construct targets are reported in Supplementary Table 3.

Cells were seeded into 12-well plates at the density of 2 × 104 cells per ml and induced with 50 ng ml−1 doxycycline for 5 days. Cells were collected and incubated for 1 h in growth medium containing 10 μg ml−1 Hoechst 33342(Invitrogen). The stained cells were then analysed by flow cytometry and cell cycle distribution was quantified using the Modfit software.

IMR5 cells were treated with 500 μM DFMO in 20% ProArg RPMI medium supplemented with 10% dialysed FBS for 5 days. Cells in log growth phase (< 80% confluence) were labelled with 1 μM puromycin at 37 °C for 1 h, then the medium was replaced by Versene (Gibco) and 5 μM cycloheximide (Sigma) to inhibit protein translation. For western blot analysis lysates were separated electrophoretically and transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad), blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBS-T, and detected with a mouse monoclonal puromycin antibody (Millipore, 1:10,000) at 4 °C overnight, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary (Proteintech, 1:10,000) for 1 h at room temperature. Protein bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Bio-Rad) and imaged on a ChemiDoc system (Bio-Rad). For flow cytometry analysis, cells were fixed in 4% formalin at room temperature for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cells were stained with PE anti-puromycin (BioLegend) for 30 min at 4 °C and analysed on a flow cytometer (Sony).

After cell lysis samples were transferred to PVDF membranes as described above. Antibodies used were used in the following concentrations: ODC1 (1:1,000, Abcam), MYCN (1:1,000, Santa Cruz), eIF5a (1:2,000, BD), eIF5A anti-hypusine (1:2,000, Merck Millipore), CENPR (1:1,000, Proteintech), KIF2C (1:1,000, Proteintech) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-GAPDH (1:10,000, Proteintech).

Total RNA from cells was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One microgram of total RNA was used to generate cDNA adapted for quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT–qPCR) (TaKaRa Bio). Real-time PCR was carried out using a Quant Studio 7 Pro Real-Time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems) and GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega). Fold change of gene expression was calculated by the 2−∆∆Ct formula using GAPDH as an endogenous reference. The list of primers for gene-expression analysis using RT–qPCR is reported in Supplementary Table 3.

Template creation: DNA constructs NheI_IRES_HA_EcoRI_xxx_BamHI and nLuc_Myc_EcoRV were synthesized by Gene Script and cloned with NheI and EcoRV sites into pcDNA3.1+ vector. Triplet sequences were inserted between HA and nLuc using EcoRI and BamHI sites: 7× CCG-Pro and 7× CCA-Pro. DNA plasmids were linearized with NotI HF (NEB). In vitro T7 transcription with linear plasmids was performed with mMESSAGE mMACHINE Kit (Invitrogen, AM1344). For the cell lysate preparation IMR5 cells were seeded in 15 cm dish at a density of 1 × 106 per dish and cultured for 5 days. Cells were then collected and centrifuged at 1,000g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets (100 mg) were lysed in 1 volume (100 μl) of lysis buffer (LB, 30 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.6), 150 mM potassium acetate, 3.9 mM magnesium actetate, 4 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol and protease inhibitor (Roche, 04693132001). Four microlitres SUPERaseIn RNase inhibitor (Ambion, was added. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. RNA and protein concentration were quantified in the cell lysate. Forty-microlitre aliquots of the cell lysates were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Six microlitres were used for the in vitro translation reaction. In vitro translation was performed in a translational mix (15 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.6), 75 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium actetate, 1.75 mM ATP, 0.4 mM GTP, 50 μM complete amino acid mix (Promega, L4461), 20 mM creatine phosphate, 0.3 mg ml−1 creatine kinase, 500 ng RNA) for 3 h at 35 °C. Spermidine was added in a final concentration 1.5 mM, if indicated. Translation reaction product was detected with Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega, N1110).

Collected Th-MYCN tumours were clamped and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. After this mechanical dissociation, crude protein extraction was obtained by lysis with CHAPS buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 2% CHAPS) with fresh protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor. This protein lysate (25 micrograms) was electrophoresed through a 5–10% Tris–glycine gel and immunoblotted using antibodies to MYCN (1:500, Cell Signaling), GAPDH (1:3,000, Cell Signaling Technologies) and eIF5A anti-hypusine (1:2,000, Millipore Sigma).

Crude protein extracts obtained as described above were electrophoresed through a slab isoelectric focusing gel (pH 3–7, Invitrogen Novex EC66452) with freshly made cathode and anode buffers (Novex). The gel was transferred to a PVDF membrane and transferred using the iBlot transfer unit prior to blocking in buffer according to manufacturer's recommendations for iBind. The iBind was then assembled with a probe against eIF5A (1:3,000, BD Laboratories) and incubated for at least 2.5 h before developing.

Collected Th-MYCN tumours were preserved in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin blocks. Slides were cut and then stained with H&E. These slides were reviewed by a pathologist blinded to the treatment groups, and tumours were scored according to: (1) differentiation status; (2) neuropil presence or absence and relative abundance; and (3) evidence of global or localized necrosis. Slides were then scanned and re-reviewed by the same pathologist.

Slides of formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumours were stained on a Bond Max (MYCN, Ki67) automated staining system (Leica Microsystems). The Bond Refine staining kit was used for MYCN and Ki67. For MYCN (1:100, Abcam) and Ki67 (1:200, Abcam), the standard protocol was followed with the exception of the primary antibody incubation which was extended to 1 h at room temperature. Antigen retrieval was performed with E2 (Leica Microsystems) retrieval solution for 20 min. After staining, all slides were rinsed, dehydrated through a series of ascending concentrations of ethanol and xylene, then cover-slipped. Stained slides were then digitally scanned at 20× magnification on an Aperio CS-O or AT2 slide scanner (Leica Biosystems) and reviewed by a pathologist blinded to the treatment groups.

Tumours were collected and pulverized as described above. From the resulting tissue powder total RNA was extracted using TRIzol according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) followed by tRNA isolation by gel extraction from denaturing 8 M urea, 8% polyacrylamide gels. Gel-extracted tRNA (560 ng) was enzymatically digested with 0.8 U nuclease P1 from Penicillium citrinum (Sigma, N8630) and 80 U GENIUS nuclease (Santa Cruz Biotech, sc-391121b) in 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH 6.0), 1.0 mM magnesium chloride at 40 °C for 70 min. Hydrolysed ribonucleotides were dephosphorylated at 37 °C for 70 min by 0.4 U snake venom phosphodiesterase (Sigma, P3243) and 0.16 U alkaline phosphatase from Escherichia coli (Sigma, P5931) after adjusting the pH with ammonium bicarbonate to a final concentration of 50 mM. The hydrolysates were mixed with 3 volumes of acetonitrile and centrifuged (16,000g, 40 min, 4 °C). The supernatants were lyophilized and dissolved in H2O for LC–MS/MS analysis. Four biological replicates for each condition (CD, CD plus DFMO, ProArg-free, ProArg-free plus DFMO) were measured, each in two technical replicates. Nucleosides were separated via reversed-phase chromatography using a Vanqush Neo UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and an Acquity nanoEase M/Z Peptide BEH C18 Column (130 Å, 1.7 μm, 300 μm × 150 mm; Waters, 186009259) and analysed on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operating in a positive-ion mode at a resolution of 45,000, the AGC target value set to 1.0 × 106 and the fill time to 50 ms. Full MS spectra (m/z 244–576) and Top7 ddMS2 spectra with a nominal collision energy of 85% were recorded. Quantitative analysis of LC–MS/MS data was performed using ElMaven software (https://github.com/ElucidataInc/ElMaven) and the identities of quantified ribonucleosides were verified by their specific fragmentation patterns in MS2 and by predetermined chromatographic elution orders of structural isomers76,77. Normalization was performed to the mean intensity of 32 nucleosides that were detected in all measurements. For nucleosides that showed a marked difference in intensity between the two technical replicates due to degradation, the second technical replicate was excluded.

Tissues were disrupted by grinding in frozen state and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 2% SDS). Proteins extracts were diluted 1:1 with 2× SDS buffer (10% SDS, 100 mM Tris pH 8.5), boiled for 10 min at 95 °C, reduced with 5 mM (final) TCEP for 15 min at 55 °C, and alkylated with 20 mM (final) CAA for 30 min at room temperature. Proteins were acidified by addition of 3% (final) perchloric acid, followed by addition of seven volumes of binding buffer (90% methanol, 100 mM TEAB). Samples were loaded on S-trap columns and processed on a Resolvex A-200 positive pressure unit (Tecan). Samples were washed 1× with binding buffer, 3× with 50% methanol/50% CHCl3 and 2× with binding buffer. Digestion buffer (150 μl TEAB 50 mM) containing trypsin 1:10 (wt:wt, enzyme:protein) and Lys-C mix 1:50 (wt:wt, enzyme:protein) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. One-hundred microlitres of digest buffer was added, and incubated overnight. Peptides were eluted with 80 μl 0.2% aqueous formic acid followed by 80 μl of 50% acetonitrile containing 0.2% formic acid. Peptides were diluted 1:1 with STOP buffer (PreOmics) and purified over iST positive pressure plates (PreOmics) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Peptides were separated on an Aurora (Gen3) 25 cm, 75 μm internal diameter column packed with C18 beads (1.7 μm) (IonOpticks) using a Vanquish Neo (Thermo Fisher Scientific) UHPLC. Peptide separation was performed using a 90-min gradient of 2–17% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) for 56 min, 17–25% solvent B for 21 min, 25–35% solvent B for 13 min, using a constant flow rate of 400 nl min−1. Column temperature was controlled at 50 °C. Mass spectrometry data were acquired with a timsTOF HT (Bruker Daltonics) in diaPASEF mode. Mass spectrometry data were collected over a 100–1,700 m/z range. During each MS/MS data collection each PASEF cycle was 1.8 s. Ion mobility was calibrated using 3 Agilent ESI-L Tuning Mix ions: 622.0289, 922.0097 and 1221.9906. For diaPASEF we used the long-gradient method which included 16 diaPASEF scans with two 25 Da windows per ramp, mass range 400.0–1,201.0 Da and mobility range 1.43–0.6 1/K0. The collision energy was decreased linearly from 59 eV at 1/K0 = 1.6 to 20 eV at 1/K0 = 0.6 V cm−2. Both accumulation time and PASEF ramp time was set to 100 ms.

Raw mass spectrometry data were analysed with Spectronaut (v.17.1) in directDIA mode with standard settings. Database search included the mouse Uniprot FASTA database.

Protein intensity values were normalized by log2 transformation and proteins with less than 70% of valid values in at least one group were filtered out. The remaining missing values were imputed using the mixed imputation approach78. In brief, missing values in samples belonging to the same group were imputed with k-nearest neighbours if there is at least 60% of valid values in that group, for that protein. The remaining missing values are imputed with the MinProb method (random draws from a Gaussian distribution; width = 0.2 and downshift = 1.8).

To measure the circulating turnover flux of a metabolite, we infused [U-13C]labelled form of the respective metabolite via the jugular venous catheter. At pseudo-steady state, the fraction of the labelled of mass isotopomer form [M + i] of the nutrient in serum is measured as \({L}_{[M+{i}]}\), such that i is from 0 to C and C is the total number of carbons in the metabolite. The circulatory turnover flux Fcirc is defined as previously79:

where R is the infusion rate of the labelled tracer. Since the turnover flux is a pseudo-steady state measurement, for minimally perturbative tracer infusions, production flux is approximately equal to consumption flux of the metabolite and thus Fcirc reflects both the circulating production and consumption fluxes of the infused metabolite in units of nmolC min−1 g−1.

The carbon atom circulatory turnover flux \({F}_{{\rm{circ}}}^{{\rm{atom}}}\) of the nutrient is calculated using

where L is the fraction of labelled carbon atoms in the nutrient:

\({F}_{{\rm{circ}}}\) measures the turnover of the whole carbon skeleton of the molecule, whereas \({F}_{{\rm{circ}}}^{{\rm{atom}}}\) measures the turnover of the carbon atoms in the molecule.

When a [U-13C]-labelled tracer X is infused, the normalized labelling of downstream metabolite Y is defined as \({L}_{Y\leftarrow X}=\frac{{L}_{Y}}{{L}_{X}}\), where LX and LY are the fraction of labelled carbon atoms for metabolite X and Y defined in equation (3).

Direct fractional contribution of each metabolite to other metabolites in a tissue is calculated by setting up the follow set of linear equations:

Where \({f}_{k\leftarrow i}\) is the fraction of k derived directly from i, M is the circulating metabolite interconversion matrix and is taken such that entry (X,Y) represents \({L}_{Y\leftarrow X}\). Direct contributions to tissue were then calculated by performing an optimization procedure conditional on non-negative values by finding min ||M, f – L|| with respect to f such that f > 0. Standard error was estimated using a bootstrapping method (n = 100 simulations) by selecting values for M and L from normal distributions with means and standard deviations equal to calculated values for those parameters based on measured data.

The procedure for calculating fluxes between circulating nutrients has been previously described thoroughly79. The input data for this calculation are the inter-labelling matrix M that reflects the extent to which infusion of any nutrient i (of n total nutrients of interest) labels every other circulating nutrient j and the carbon atom circulatory turnover flux for each circulating nutrient \({F}_{{\rm{circ}}}^{{\rm{atom}}}\). The procedure first uses M to calculate the direct contributions to each nutrient i from all other circulating nutrients j, creating a new n × n matrix N whose entries Nij reflect the direct contributions of circulating nutrient j to circulating nutrient i. It then utilizes the matrix N and \({F}_{{\rm{circ}}}^{{\rm{atom}}}\) to calculate the direct contributing fluxes from any circulating nutrient to any other circulating nutrient, resulting in a complete determination of the inter-converting fluxes in units of nmolC min−1 g−1 between circulating nutrients. Fluxes were computed using Matlab (v.R2019a). The network was visualized using Cytoscape (v2.9.0).

All omics were analysed and visualized in R (Statistical Computing, v.4.1.0). Gene set enrichment was performed using fgsea (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/fgsea.html) using as input gene or protein list rank by relative changes (log2-transformed fold change of comparison). Gene sets were taken from the Mouse MSigDB Collections using the gene sets MH (Hallmark) and the M2 (canonical pathways) using the Reactome subset80. We used 1,000 permutations of the gene-level values to calculate NES and statistical significance.

The super enhancer core regulatory circuitry has been described by Durbin et al.40 and modified by Decaesteker et al.54. The retino-sympathetic and adrenergic circuit has been described by Zimmerman et al.81.

To determine cell-type abundance a deconvolution approach was used leveraging the bulk gene-expression profiles of the Th-MYCN tumours for the four treatment groups: CD, ProArg-free diet, CD plus DFMO and ProArg-free diet plus DFMO. We used the CIBERSORTx82, a machine learning method to infer cell-type proportions without physical cell isolation based on the creation of a signature matrix of cell types identified in Th-MYCN tumour model in published single-cell RNA-sequencing data by Costa et al.83. Using this high-resolution single-cell annotation of the tumour microenvironment in Th-MYCN mice the digital cytometry tool was run on bulk tumour expression to extract cell-type abundances and dissect the effect of treatment on the tumour microenvironment.

The number of human and mouse samples is recorded in the figure captions. For human tumour measurements, n represents the number of patients. For mouse experiments, n represents the number of mice. P values were computed using an unpaired two-sided Welch's t-test using the Welch–Satterthwaite equation (not assuming equal variances) unless specified otherwise. Regression between adenosine-ending codon and protein levels were calculated with the R function stat_cor (package ggpubr) to compute Pearson's r and geom_smooth (package ggplot2) using ‘linear model' to display the regression line. Statistics were performed using R (v.4.1.0).

A two-tailed unpaired Welch's t-test was used to calculate P values. Metabolomics data were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg method, with a FDR cut-off of 0.05 used to determine statistical significance.

P values were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method, with a FDR cut-off of 0.05 used to determine statistical significance.

Two-sided Student's t-tests were calculated with a permutation-based FDR cut-off of 0.05 and s0 = 1 if not otherwise declared.

A two-tailed unpaired Welch's t-test was used to calculate P values. Modifications were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg method, with an FDR cut-off of 0.05 used to determine statistical significance.

Comparisons of outcome between groups were performed by a two-sided log-rank test, tumour-related death is counted as an event, with mice censored at the time of death without tumour or necropsy. Survival was statistically assessed according to the method of Kaplan and Meier84 according to Peto and Peto85.

Representative results, such as blots and H&E staining, were independently validated in at least two independent experiments yielding similar results. This include Fig. 6g,h, Extended Data Figs. 8d,e,n and 9i and Supplementary Figs. 2b, 3b, 4f and 7b.

Animal studies followed protocols approved by the Princeton University and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Patient samples obtained from the COG (Neuroblastoma Biology Committee) underwent review and approval through a Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program overseen process: application ANBL16B2 Q, principal investigator J.D.R.

Metrics details

Small molecular food components contribute to the health benefits of diets rich in fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices. The cellular mechanisms by which noncaloric bioactives promote healthspan are not well understood, limiting their use in disease prevention. Here, we deploy a whole-organism, high-content screen in zebrafish to profile food-derived compounds for activation of autophagy, a cellular quality control mechanism that promotes healthy aging. We identify thymol and carvacrol as activators of autophagy and mitophagy through a transient dampening of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Chemical stabilization of thymol-induced mitochondrial depolarization blocks mitophagy activation, suggesting a mechanism originating from the mitochondrial membrane. Supplementation with thymol prevents excess liver fat accumulation in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, improves pink-1-dependent heat stress resilience in Caenorhabditis elegans, and slows the decline of skeletal muscle performance while delaying epigenetic aging in SAMP8 mice. Thus, terpenoids from common herbs promote autophagy during aging and metabolic overload, making them attractive molecules for nutrition-based healthspan promotion.

Despite an extraordinary increase in lifespan over the past 170 years1, the prevalence of chronic diseases among the rapidly growing population of older adults remains high due to environmental, lifestyle and nutritional factors2. Among these, inadequate nutrition makes a major contribution to the onset and progression of noncommunicable diseases and mortality. The intake of excess calories, as well as the overconsumption or underconsumption of specific food and nutrient groups, has been associated with a wide range of negative health outcomes3. Prevention through nutritional approaches, sometimes referred to as ‘food as first medicine', is therefore gaining importance in lowering the burden of noncommunicable diseases4. Beyond recommendations for adequate portion sizes and balanced consumption of nutrient-dense foods, specific dietary patterns are effective tools for disease prevention. For instance, caloric restriction and regimens under the umbrella term of intermittent fasting, such as alternate-day fasting, 5:2 fasting and time-restricted eating, show promise in promoting healthy aging not only through weight loss but also through other mechanisms independent of changes in weight5,6,7,8. At the cellular level, various molecular adaptations promote the health benefits of caloric restriction and intermittent fasting, among which the activation of autophagy is believed to be a principal mechanism explaining their geroprotective effects9. Autophagy prevents proteotoxicity and cellular damage by recycling protein aggregates and dysfunctional organelles, leading to improved organism resilience against metabolic challenges and other age-related cellular stressors10. The requirement for intact autophagy to mediate the benefits of caloric restriction in extending healthspan and lifespan has been demonstrated by genetic loss-of-function experiments in a wide range of experimental models (including yeast, worms and flies) carrying deletions in genes related to autophagy11. Similar findings have been confirmed in mammals. For example, genetic ablation of autophagy in the liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle or hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin neurons of mice abolishes the system-wide beneficial effects of intermittent fasting, suggesting a conserved role of autophagy for healthy aging in mammals12.

The uptake of dietary patterns that activate autophagy is complicated by the need for low-calorie intake over an extended period before autophagy is efficiently induced. In addition, the efficacy with which fasting activates autophagy shows a large variability across individuals13. To circumvent these challenges, small molecules could be used to mimic the benefits of fasting and caloric restriction while following a diet with normal or only slightly reduced caloric intake14. Such a strategy should ideally be based on food-grade ingredients that activate autophagy and can be used in a dietary context for preventive health before drugs are medically indicated. For example, spermidine, urolithin A and resveratrol have been shown to provide broad health benefits across organ systems, with a remarkable level of conservation across species15,16,17,18,19. However, the number of natural bioactive compounds that can be safely used at efficacious levels in food and beverage formats remains small, limiting the potential to promote autophagy as part of diets that can be widely adopted for disease prevention.

In this study, we developed and deployed a rapid testing approach in zebrafish as a suitable whole-organism model for small-molecule discovery, with the aim of finding food-grade autophagy activators20. Zebrafish have been used to measure autophagy in vivo, providing a vertebrate model that recapitulates organismal complexity21,22. In practice, the use of zebrafish for the discovery of autophagy modulators has been limited by the need for microscopy and the quantification of autophagy in individual animals23,24. In this study, we established an in vivo workflow for the discovery of autophagy modulators using a transgenic construct in which ZsGreen is tagged to the autophagosome-localized protein LC3 (encoded by map1lc3), combined with high-content image acquisition and analysis in live zebrafish. We tested a library of natural bioactive molecules and identified thymol and carvacrol, major components of thyme and oregano, as autophagy inducers in zebrafish, mice and human cells. Mechanistically, thymol transiently lowers the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), triggering a cellular stress response that promotes the recycling of damaged mitochondria. Thymol supplementation reduces hepatic fat content in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, delays age-related phenotypes in worms, and lowers epigenetic age in conjunction with improved muscle performance in a naturally occurring mouse strain affected by premature mobility decline.

Autophagy requires the conjugation of the cytosolic LC3 protein (LC3-I) with the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3-II on the surface of autophagosomes25. The change from a dispersed cytosolic presence of LC3-I to the formation of vesicular structures rich in LC3-II can be exploited in confocal microscopy to visualize autophagosomes. We developed a zebrafish model in which we tagged the fluorescent reporter protein ZsGreen in frame to the 5′ end of map1lc3. To drive the expression of the reporter gene in skeletal muscle, we used the skeletal muscle-specific promoter of actc1b and generated Tg(actc1b:ZsGreen-map1lc3;cryaa:TdTomato) zebrafish, hereafter named actc1b:ZsGreen-LC3 (Fig. 1a,b and Extended Data Fig. 1a). Next, we set up an image acquisition and analysis pipeline that detects LC3-positive puncta for in vivo quantification of autophagosomes (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b). Profiling of zebrafish larvae showed that the number of autophagosomes increased from 3 to 6 days post fertilization (dpf) (Fig. 1c,d). Cotreatment with the lysosomotropic agent ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), an inhibitor of autophagosome degradation, increased the accumulation of LC3 puncta compared to baseline from 4 dpf, demonstrating a bona fide increase in autophagic flux (Fig. 1d)26. This result is consistent with autophagy activation during the transition of zebrafish larvae from the ‘yolk-feeding' stage at 3 dpf to a state of limited energy substrate availability due to yolk consumption at 6 dpf (ref. 27). To enable the discovery of previously unidentified autophagy modulators in vivo, we implemented a semiautomated multistep protocol as summarized in Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1c. We opted for an early time window, with analysis at 3 dpf when endogenous autophagic flux is low. Specifically, we distributed larvae at 2 dpf into 96-well microplates. After incubation with the compound of interest, the larvae were immobilized through treatment with an anesthetic before image acquisition as described above. Following the first acquisition, the anesthetic was washed out and the larvae were treated with NH4Cl before a second round of imaging was performed.

The resulting objects were identified and counted as described in Extended Data Fig. 1b. d, Measurement of autophagic flux in zebrafish larvae by relative quantification of the total area of LC3 puncta normalized to control before and after 4 h of exposure to 100 mM NH4Cl (− NH4Cl: 3 dpf, n = 72; 4 dpf, n = 59; 5 dpf, n = 60; 6 dpf, n = 69; + NH4Cl: 3 dpf, n = 75; 4 dpf, n = 61; 5 dpf, n = 68; 6 dpf, n = 72). e, Workflow for rapid testing of small molecules in 96-well microplates to identify modulators of autophagy. f, Representative images of transgenic zebrafish larvae at 3 dpf treated for 16 h with 1 µM rapamycin (top), followed by treatment with NH4Cl (bottom). g, Quantification of autophagic flux in zebrafish larvae treated with rapamycin (3 dpf; vehicle −/+ NH4Cl, n = 68; rapamycin − NH4Cl, n = 67; rapamycin + NH4Cl, n = 71) and normalized to control (vehicle, 1% DMSO).

For validation, larvae were treated with rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor with well-established effects on autophagy induction in mammals. mTOR activity was abolished after 20 h of treatment of wild-type larvae, as demonstrated by S6 protein phosphorylation (Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). Accordingly, treatment of actc1b:ZsGreen-LC3 larvae for 16 h enhanced autophagic flux in the absence of NH4Cl, and the same effect was observed following 4 h of incubation with NH4Cl (Fig. 1f,g). Next, we tested the evolutionary conservation of autophagy modulation in zebrafish by performing a pilot screen using a commercial collection of 240 synthetic and natural pharmacophores. Among the seven hits that were identified, three small molecules—ceramide, calpeptin and retinoic acid—have been previously reported to induce autophagy in mammalian cells (Extended Data Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 1)28,29,30.

These results validate zebrafish as a model for quantifying autophagy levels in vivo, while the semiautomatic analysis pipeline provides a rapid workflow for the discovery of autophagy inducers.

To enrich a screening library for molecules with a favorable safety profile for human translation, we next curated a list of natural bioactive compounds from edible sources and endogenous metabolites, including vitamins, bioactive molecules from herbs and spices, and human serum metabolites (Supplementary Table 2). The molecules were screened at concentrations from 10 to 250 µM and were ranked according to their maximum efficacy (Emax) in the presence of NH4Cl (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 2). The analysis included high-content imaging of LC3-positive puncta in more than 2,500 larvae in the presence or absence of NH4Cl. Carvacrol and thymol, terpenoids abundant in essential oils derived from common thyme (Thymus vulgaris) and oregano (Origanum vulgare), were the most potent autophagy activators among all the screened bioactive ingredients (Fig. 2a). Images of actc1b:ZsGreen-LC3 larvae demonstrated an accumulation of LC3 puncta at baseline, with a further increase after the addition of NH4Cl (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 2a). Both molecules showed a dose–response relationship, with substantial effects on autophagy starting from 50 µM for carvacrol and 10 µM for thymol (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). Thymol and carvacrol constitute up to 60% of all phytochemicals in the oil fraction of oregano and thyme31. Therefore, we hypothesized that oregano essential oil, a natural product extracted from dry oregano leaves and containing the monoterpenoids carvacrol, p-cymene and thymol (Extended Data Table 1), exhibits bioactivity related to autophagy. Consistent with this, we observed that treatment with oregano essential oil induced a robust increase in autophagic flux (Fig. 2c). Notably, thymol, carvacrol and oregano essential oil demonstrated similar efficacy to rapamycin at the doses tested, making them promising candidates for exploring autophagy-dependent health benefits. Considering the structural similarity and comparable efficacy of thymol and carvacrol, we chose thymol as the lead ingredient for subsequent experiments, based on the availability of pharmacokinetic studies in humans32. As thymol is metabolized through phase II reactions, we assessed the efficacy of thymol sulfate and thymol glucuronide, the two most prevalent metabolites in human blood after thymol ingestion32. Remarkably, both thymol sulfate and thymol glucuronide induced autophagy similarly to free thymol (Fig. 2d,e), indicating that the conjugation of thymol does not interfere with its bioactivity. Thymol did not affect S6 and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, suggesting that autophagy is not directly activated through these canonical regulatory pathways (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).

In summary, we identified thymol and carvacrol as potent autophagy inducers that are naturally found in oregano and thyme.

We next aimed to determine how thymol induces autophagy and whether the mode of action is conserved across species. Jurkat cells, a human cell line that grows in suspension, can be used to measure autophagic flux through flow cytometry. Treatment with thymol increased the LC3-II signal in the presence of the lysosomal inhibitor starting at 62.5 µM (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Based on previous reports that thymol intercalates into lipid bilayers, we hypothesized that thymol acts at the level of the mitochondrial membrane to activate autophagy33,34,35. Thymol caused a mild decrease in the MMP, as detected by a fluorometric shift in JC-10 emission from orange, which represents the aggregate form, to green, representing the monomeric form, compared to the chemical uncoupler FCCP (Fig. 3c). Cell viability was not affected even in the presence of 250 µM thymol for up to 6 h, suggesting that autophagy is not a result of cellular toxicity (Extended Data Fig. 3b). To confirm similar bioactivity on mitochondrial membranes, we quantified the MMP in Jurkat cells treated with carvacrol and found a comparable effect to that of thymol (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Consistent with membrane depolarization, treatment with thymol and carvacrol increased mitochondrial superoxide generation, suggesting a mechanism that originates at the mitochondrial membrane (Extended Data Fig. 3d).

Changes in the MMP can affect the respiratory chain and modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Therefore, we measured the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in mitochondria purified from mouse livers that were treated ex vivo with a range of thymol doses. Consistent with our previous observation that thymol affects the MMP, we found a dose-dependent effect on mitochondrial respiration with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 295.7 ± 6.7 µM in healthy mitochondria (Fig. 3d). Based on these results, we validated the effects through a different method for quantifying the MMP, in which we used primary mouse adult fibroblasts (MAFs) from the same animal model used for OCR quantification. MAFs were treated with thymol for 24 h and then exposed to the fluorescent dye TMRM, a sensitive marker for MMP changes. As expected, TMRM fluorescence was reduced in thymol-treated cells (Fig. 3e), leading to a significant decrease in the TMRM signal compared to that of the control (Student's t test, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3f). Carvacrol had similar effects on the MMP (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f).

We next asked whether thymol treatment leads to transcriptional adaptations consistent with changes in cellular energy homeostasis. QuantSeq 3′ mRNA sequencing revealed 273 differentially expressed genes in thymol-treated cells compared to controls (Extended Data Fig. 3g and Supplementary Table 3). Unbiased gene set analysis of cellular hallmarks revealed an anti-inflammatory gene expression signature, with three of the top seven pathways indicating downregulated inflammatory signaling, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling via nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and IL-6–JAK–STAT3 signaling (Fig. 3g). Notably, a gene signature consistent with the activation of an unfolded protein response was upregulated, indicative of a cellular stress response (Extended Data Fig. 3h and Supplementary Table 4). Further, a targeted Gene Ontology analysis of 24 curated biological processes related to cellular energy metabolism and autophagy showed upregulation of pathways linked to macroautophagy, autophagy and protein catabolic processes. In contrast, Gene Ontology terms related to the response to starvation were downregulated (Fig. 3h and Supplementary Table 5).

Depolarization of mitochondria is thought to induce autophagy and mitophagy, thereby initiating the targeted removal and replacement of cellular components, which results in improved resilience to energetic stressors and damage36. To be beneficial, this mechanism needs to be transient, without long-term inhibitory effects on cellular respiration, and should be moderate enough to predominantly affect damaged mitochondria. We first tested the kinetics of thymol's effects on mitochondrial respiration by measuring the OCR in zebrafish larvae. In this setup, we compared a vehicle group to a group of animals that were continuously exposed to thymol and to another group in which thymol treatment was replaced by vehicle treatment 30 min before the analysis (Fig. 3i). Consistent with the in vitro experiments in mammalian cells, thymol reduced basal respiration in larvae, with minor effects on uncoupled respiration, suggesting that thymol does not affect maximal respiratory capacity. Importantly, mitochondrial function was fully rescued within 30 min following the removal of thymol (Fig. 3j,k). We hypothesized that transient inhibition of mitochondrial respiration leads to autophagy, thereby removing toxic materials and improving overall cellular quality. To test whether thymol increases organismal resilience, we treated zebrafish larvae with the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone, a toxin whose effects have been previously shown to be counteracted by the activation of autophagy and mitophagy37. Pretreatment of larvae with thymol for 16 h at three different doses reduced rotenone-induced toxicity, indicating that thymol primes cells for improved resilience to mitochondrial damage (Fig. 3l).

In summary, these results show that the effects of thymol on mitochondrial membrane integrity and respiratory function are transient, reversible, and confer protection at both the cellular and organismal levels.

The activation of autophagy and the transient inhibition of mitochondrial respiration suggest that both mechanisms induced by thymol are functionally connected. To test whether thymol's effect of lowering of the MMP triggers the activation of mitophagy in addition to macroautophagy, we obtained MAFs derived from mito-QC reporter mice that carry a tandem mCherry-GFP tag fused to the mitochondrial targeting sequence of the outer mitochondrial membrane protein FIS1 (encoded by Fis1)38 (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Fibroblasts were derived from male mito-QC mice. Of note, all mice used in the study, including those receiving in vivo treatments, were male. When mitophagy is activated in these mice, mitochondria tagged by the reporter construct are delivered to lysosomes, where GFP fluorescence is quenched by the acidic environment of the lumen, resulting in red foci of mitochondria due to the remaining fluorescence emission of the mCherry signal. Treatment with thymol for 24 h led to a strong activation of mitophagy, measured by the appearance of red fluorescent puncta and quantified as the mitophagy index, defined as the ratio of mCherry-positive mitolysosomes to the total number of mCherry-GFP-positive mitochondria (Fig. 4a,b). In contrast, cotreatment with oligomycin, an inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP synthase that blocks proton efflux and prevents mitochondrial depolarization, attenuated the effect of thymol on mitophagy (Fig. 4a,b). Thus, thymol-induced mitochondrial depolarization is necessary to initiate the mitophagy process. Next, we turned to an in vivo mammalian model and performed oral gavage with two administrations of thymol at 20 mg kg−1 per dose using mito-QC reporter mice (Fig. 4c). Gastrocnemius muscle biopsies and liver samples were collected 2 h after the last treatment, and histological sections were imaged to assess mitophagy levels (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 4b). Oral thymol treatment resulted in a striking induction of mitophagy in skeletal muscle, as demonstrated by increases in the mitophagy index and the number of mCherry-positive mitochondria (Fig. 4e,f). In contrast, mitophagy activation in liver samples was similar between the thymol and vehicle groups, potentially limited by the timing of sampling relative to the pharmacodynamics of thymol, or due to the mosaic expression of the transgene as reported previously (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d)38,39.

Taken together, our results show that mitophagy activation by oregano terpenoids occurs both in vitro and in vivo and is triggered by a mechanism that requires mild and transient mitochondrial depolarization.

Autophagy enables the degradation of triglyceride-rich lipid droplets in hepatocytes, protecting against aberrant liver fat accumulation, a common phenotype in aging that is compounded by calorie-dense but nutrient-poor Western diets40. As thymol inhibits the respiratory capacity of liver mitochondria at elevated doses (Fig. 3d), we tested its effects on hepatic macroautophagy and mitophagy by western blot analysis in wild-type mice. Total tissue lysate and mitochondria were purified from liver tissue to determine markers of autophagy and mitophagy in response to oral treatment (Fig. 5a). Thymol increased the autophagic flux, measured as the LC3-II/LC3-I protein ratio, in conjunction with hyperphosphorylation of mitochondrial ubiquitin at the Ser-65 residue, suggesting mitophagy activation through canonical PINK-1/Parkin signaling (Fig. 5b,c). In contrast, the levels of the autophagy target P62 remained unchanged, potentially due to the variable timing with which these markers respond during different stages of the autophagic flux41.

Following this acute study, we set out to test whether thymol prevents the accumulation of excess liver fat in chronic conditions. Groups of mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and supplemented with 20 mg kg−1 of thymol or a vehicle control by gavage for 5 days per week over 8 weeks. A group of mice was fed a standard chow diet and received vehicle treatment by gavage to serve as a reference (Fig. 5d). At the end of the treatment, body weight was higher in mice fed a HFD than in their littermates that were fed a standard diet (Fig. 5e). Thymol had no effects on weight gain (Fig. 5e), body composition (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b) or food intake (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Blood glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were similar between the thymol-treated and control HFD-fed groups (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). In contrast, liver histological analysis revealed robust protection against steatosis and preserved tissue morphology in thymol-treated mice compared to the vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 5f). Oil Red O (ORO) analysis showed that the amount of lipid droplets decreased in the livers of animals treated with thymol, along with a reduction in tissue triglyceride content (Fig. 5g,h). Consistent with an enhancement of autophagy, we observed lower levels of P62, an autophagy cargo adaptor and substrate that becomes depleted in response to increased autophagic flux10 (Fig. 5i,j). No differences between groups were observed for the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, suggesting that autophagic flux stabilizes over the treatment period and leads to the degradation of autophagosomes and their cargo, including P62, without further changes in the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio.

Taken together, oral thymol intake acutely activates liver autophagy and mitophagy, preventing excess liver fat accumulation during a chronic HFD challenge, independent of changes in body weight.

Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-suited model organism for studying epistatic mechanisms that mediate the effects of small-molecule interventions on healthspan42. We first aimed to confirm an evolutionarily conserved effect of thymol and carvacrol on autophagy induction. We treated wild-type worms that carry a transgene in which GFP is fused to the C. elegans ortholog of MAP1LC3, leading to the expression of a GFP::LGG-1 reporter. Worms were exposed to thymol or carvacrol at different life stages and for varying durations of exposure. Thymol and carvacrol increased GFP::LGG-1 puncta in young (day 1) and adult worms in response to lifelong treatment (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig. 6a). The same effect was observed in aged animals (10 days old) treated throughout their lives or in response to a subchronic duration of 72 h (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig. 6a). Notably, autophagy levels in aged C. elegans treated with the terpenoids were robust and comparable to those observed in young worms, despite lower baseline autophagy levels (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig. 6a). Thus, thymol is effective in overcoming age-related declines in autophagy levels. Based on the ability to induce autophagy in C. elegans, we used a transgenic line carrying a mitochondria-targeted Rosella (mtRosella) reporter in the muscle cells of the body wall. This dual-fluorescent reporter coexpresses pH-sensitive GFP (mtGFP) and pH-insensitive DsRed. In this setup, we tested the ability of thymol to activate mitophagy in wild-type worms and pink-1 mutants lacking the membrane-bound PINK-1 protein, which initiates canonical mitophagy upon membrane depolarization43. Thymol robustly increased mitophagy signals in both young and aged worms (Fig. 6b–d). The reversal of age-related autophagy decline was absent in worms lacking functional PINK-1 signaling, demonstrating that thymol signals through canonical mitophagy activation (Fig. 6c,d).

Exposing cells to nonphysiological temperatures induces the expression of heat shock proteins, a group of chaperones that protect cellular components by forming protein aggregates44. We hypothesized that thymol increases resilience to heat stress through the turnover of protein aggregates and damaged mitochondria, thereby reinstating proteostasis that is perturbed by high temperatures. Exposure of C. elegans to a temperature of 37 °C for 4 h sharply reduced their activity score, a measure that assesses animal motility as a readout of recovery from the heat exposure (Fig. 6e–j). Thymol or carvacrol treatments 72 h before the heat shock robustly improved thermotolerance, measured as the percentage of active animals during a time course of 32 h after the thermal shock (Fig. 6e,f). We repeated the same experiment in worms with genetic deletions of daf-16, which is critical for autophagy signaling, and pink-1, the gatekeeper of canonical mitophagy signaling, to test dependency on these pathways45. Thymol did not protect worms deficient in daf-16 and pink-1, indicating that these genes are required for the benefits of thymol (Fig. 6g,h). C. elegans deficient in aak-2, the ortholog of genes encoding proteins of the AMPK complex in vertebrates, also interfered with thymol-dependent motility benefits, consistent with the upstream regulatory role of AMPK in the induction of autophagy and mitophagy46 (Fig. 6i). In contrast, the effects of thymol did not depend on skn-1, which encodes a transcription factor with conserved functions in oxidative stress responses to NRF2 in mammals47, indicating that the protective effects do not rely on reactive oxygen species signaling (Fig. 6j).

Next, we assessed motility as a surrogate for improved healthspan during lifelong treatments in microfluidic chambers. Activity scores improved in worms exposed to thymol at concentrations of 25 and 50 µM from 7 to 10 days of adulthood (Fig. 6k,l). Similar benefits regarding age-related motility were also observed when using conventional microplates, with thymol and carvacrol at concentrations of 25 and 50 µM consistently enhancing velocity and total traveled distance following treatments from the egg stage to 10 days of adulthood (Extended Data Fig. 6b–e).

Lastly, we asked whether the improved motility outcomes were also reflected in preserved anatomical structures. To this end, we used a strain that expresses MYO-3 tagged with GFP in body wall muscles and quantified the damage to myofibrils, which consist of the contractile proteins required for efficient movement. During aging, myofibers exhibit severe damage and decreased MYO-3 expression48. Thymol and carvacrol treatments preserved myofiber structure at 25 and 50 µM, while higher doses did not reduce damage (Fig. 6m and Extended Data Fig. 6f), suggesting that higher doses may lack benefits under chronic exposure. Moreover, both thymol and carvacrol increased the MYO-3::GFP fluorescence intensity at all tested doses, indicating healthier myofibrils (Extended Data Fig. 6g–i). We did not observe an effect on overall lifespan, potentially due to antagonistic effects under chronic exposure, among other reasons (Extended Data Fig. 6j,k).

In summary, thymol improves age-related motility and slows skeletal muscle decline by enhancing cellular resilience to aging and stress through the activation of autophagy and mitophagy.

The effects of thymol on autophagy across species and tissue types suggest broad benefits that collectively support healthy aging. To this end, we aimed to translate these findings to a mammalian model of progressive aging by studying SAMP8 (senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8) mice. This model is particularly suited for studying the aging of the brain and physical performance, two domains that have a major role in age-related disabilities in humans. SAMP8 mice are an inbred strain selected from a genetically heterogeneous population of mice. Specifically, these mice naturally develop early signs of aging, such as reduced locomotor performance, sarcopenia, and cognitive decline linked to an accumulation of protein aggregates and a loss of mitochondrial respiratory function. Therefore, they are considered a relevant model for human aging49,50. We administered thymol at a dose of 20 mg kg−1 per day or vehicle by oral gavage for 5 days per week over 12 weeks starting at 8 months of age (Fig. 7a). First, we analyzed DNA methylation patterns that predict age-adjusted health status. These methylation-based epigenetic clocks are emerging as relevant biomarkers of aging in mammals and are used to detect the beneficial effects of interventions designed to extend healthspan51. Notably, the skeletal muscle tissue of mice supplemented with thymol showed a reduction in epigenetic age, as assessed using a pan-tissue epigenetic clock52, of approximately 20% compared to the control group (Student's t test, P = 0.033) (Fig. 7b).

Similar to findings in mice fed a HFD, thymol treatment did not affect body weight (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Histological analysis of the tibialis anterior muscle showed larger myofibers in mice treated with thymol compared to controls (Fig. 7c). The frequency distribution of the muscle fiber area further showed a shift toward larger myofibers compared to untreated mice (Fig. 7d), resulting in an approximately 13% increase in the cross-sectional fiber area (Student's t test, P < 0.001) (Fig. 7e). Endurance was strikingly higher in the thymol-treated group than in the control group (Fig. 7f). Notably, average performance increased twofold from baseline in treated mice, whereas it remained stable in the controls, suggesting an improvement in performance induced by thymol, even in a life stage characterized by a decline in mobility (Fig. 7g). Grip strength was preserved throughout the study in the treatment group, showing a robust preventive effect against the decline of muscle strength compared to control animals (Fig. 7h). Numerically, strength decreased by 36% from baseline in the vehicle-treated controls but remained stable from baseline in the thymol-treated group (Fig. 7i). The weights of the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles did not show differences between the groups (Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). Furthermore, motor coordination and working memory capacity, measured by the rotarod test and the continuous Y maze task, improved in the group of mice treated with thymol (Extended Data Fig. 7d,e). Despite the remarkable phenotypic improvements, the levels of mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins and protein markers of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response remained unchanged, suggesting a relatively selective effect on mitophagy independent of major changes in the total mitochondrial mass (Extended Data Fig. 7f). Gene expression changes were moderate, with only one gene set related to anti-inflammatory responses showing significant enrichment (Fig. 7j and Supplementary Table 6). Of note, the gene set—hallmark TNF signaling via NF-κB—was similar to that found in MAFs in response to thymol treatment (Extended Data Fig. 7g). Western blot analysis of gastrocnemius tissue biopsies showed an increased amount of PINK-1 protein, indicating robust activation of mitophagy through canonical PINK-1 signaling (Fig. 7k,l).

Together, these data indicate that thymol treatment delays the age-related decline in muscle performance and lowers epigenetic age in SAMP8 mice.

Autophagy has emerged as a principal mechanism that maintains cellular functions during aging53. Here, we describe thymol and carvacrol, two isomeric phenolic monoterpenes derived from thyme and oregano, as inducers of autophagy and mitophagy both in vitro and in vivo, with conserved effects across species. Thymol and carvacrol are hydrophobic molecules with bactericidal properties due to their ability to intercalate into bacterial membranes, and they are thought to provide antipathogenic defenses33,34,35. Mitochondria evolved from ancestral proteobacteria through an endosymbiotic process, giving rise to the bioenergetic properties of aerobic eukaryotes54. Autophagy induction by thymol in our eukaryotic models is consistent with an effect on mitochondrial membranes that resembles bacterial membrane disruption. Molecules that intercalate into mitochondrial membranes, such as the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ, have been shown to depolarize mitochondria and trigger autophagy36. This depolarization stimulates the PINK-1-dependent recruitment of Parkin, which in turn mediates the elimination of mitochondria in lysosomes through mitophagy43. In support of this hypothesis, we show that thymol lowers oxygen consumption in live zebrafish and impairs oxygen flux in preparations of freshly isolated mitochondria from mouse hepatocytes. Mechanistically, the induction of mitophagy by thymol depends on PINK-1, while oligomycin—a chemical that inhibits proton flux across the mitochondrial membrane and thereby counteracts membrane depolarization—blunts thymol-induced mitophagy. These results provide robust evidence for a mitochondrial membrane-originating mechanism through which thymol activates autophagy by depolarizing mitochondria, thereby enhancing mitochondrial clearance both in vitro and in vivo.

Mild, transient mitochondrial perturbations activate cellular stress response mechanisms, including autophagy and mitophagy, leading to long-term benefits through a process known as mitohormesis55,56. Previous reports show that not all damaged mitochondria can be efficiently cleared by mitophagy unless a certain threshold of damage is crossed and autophagy is activated by independent mechanisms57,58. We propose that thymol has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile for achieving mitohormetic effects in vivo. Previous pharmacokinetic studies in animals and humans show that thymol has a rapid Tmax of 0.5 and 1.97 h, respectively, followed by relatively fast clearance, with a half-life of 10.2 h in humans32,59. This prompt clearance of circulating thymol suggests that cells are only transiently exposed to its effects. As a result, mitophagy is primarily activated in damaged mitochondria, while autophagy is not activated in healthy mitochondria with normal electrochemical coupling. Rapid absorption in the duodenum further suggests that oral intake leads to transient peaks in thymol and its conjugates, reaching levels sufficient to activate autophagy in tissues before they are cleared60. While the exact pharmacokinetic profile and pharmacodynamic mechanism of action of thymol on mitochondrial turnover remain to be established, its common use in traditional medicine supports its safety in humans61.

In metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease, autophagy is known to hydrolyze triacylglycerol from lipid droplets40. Mitophagy concomitantly increases the turnover of defective mitochondria, thereby facilitating fatty acid oxidation and efficient metabolic coupling, as well as protecting hepatocytes against aberrant liver fat accumulation62. Our findings show that chronic administration of thymol to mice fed a HFD resulted in a reduction in liver lipid deposition and lower levels of P62 protein. Thymol did not affect body weight, which aligns with the potential for caloric restriction mimetic effects independent of weight loss.

Next, we tested the ability of C. elegans to adapt to heat stress. Autophagy has been reported to promote thermotolerance due to its role in the removal of protein aggregates that form when cellular temperatures rise to toxic levels63. Thymol efficiently preserved activity in response to heat shock, suggesting that autophagy is the underlying protective mechanism. Finally, we showed that thymol-treated worms had increased motility with age, accompanied by a lower degree of myofiber damage, suggesting protection against the age-related decline in body wall muscle function and thereby preserving mobility. Based on these results, we turned to SAMP8 mice, which are characterized by the occurrence of protein aggregates in the brain and skeletal muscle, among other tissues50. Thymol demonstrated a remarkable restoration of motor performance, including improvements in strength and endurance. The functional benefits were accompanied by a lower epigenetic age determined using a pan-tissue clock readout, suggesting a potent antiaging effect at the tissue level and its relevance for translation. A limitation of our study is the use of male mice across the different in vivo experiments, a choice made due to the availability constraints of aged animals. Although testing the efficacy of thymol and carvacrol in females is an important next step, the consistent effects observed in zebrafish larvae (a stage before sex determination) and in the hermaphrodite C. elegans suggest a largely sex-independent mechanism.

While deploying different species and experimental models is a strength of this work, the approach of using zebrafish larvae has some limitations. Our discovery paradigm is likely to miss compounds that depend on signaling pathways not yet established during early larval stages, as well as those specific to old age. Other limitations include the difficulty in deciding doses for oral efficacy in preclinical models, a problem that we mitigated by relying on the known pharmacokinetics of thymol in humans and rodents.

Terpenoids and polyphenolic compounds are secondary plant metabolites enriched in diets characterized by a high contribution of fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices64. Some of these noncaloric phytonutrients are proposed to stimulate autophagy and mitophagy, potentially forming part of the overall health impact of these diets through the cumulative effects of bioactive mixtures65. Analyses of dietary habits among people living in areas with a high percentage of centenarians indicate that individuals with extraordinary healthspans consume diets rich in mitohormetic phytochemicals66. The limited knowledge of the overall intake doses of thymol from aromatic plants makes it challenging to perform a systematic analysis of its contribution to long-term benefits through diet. Nonetheless, carvacrol- and thymol-containing plants have been used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and bactericidal properties, although their mechanism of action has remained largely elusive67,68.

Secondary plant metabolites have numerous biological functions, including symbiotic advantages such as producing colors and flavors, conferring resistance to stressors (such as drought, heat and radiation) and possessing antipathogenic properties, among other functions that may explain their bioactivity in humans. In fact, a surprising number of plant bioactives have inhibitory or modulatory effects on cellular bioenergetic functions in eukaryotic cells. For example, biguanides from the French lilac (Galega officinalis) inhibit mitochondrial respiratory complex I69,70 and have served as the lead structures for the antidiabetic medication metformin. Resveratrol and related flavonoid polyphenols from grapes and berries have been shown to bind to and inhibit F1-ATPase, slowing ATP synthesis71. Here, we demonstrate that thymol activates autophagy and mitophagy through a mechanism initiated at the level of mitochondrial bioenergetics, which may be related to the bactericidal properties of thymol as part of its original function in pathogen defense. Thus, the activation of cellular stress pathways by thymol, and potentially other secondary plant metabolites that target bacterial membranes, may reflect moonlighting functions in mitochondrial bioenergetics, autophagy and mitophagy when ingested and absorbed into mammalian cells.

Beyond the induction of autophagy and mitophagy at the mitochondrial level, pleiotropic effects likely exist. For example, thymol's effects on bacteria could influence the gut microbiome, which mediates positive health outcomes from fasting and metformin treatment72,73. While our cellular experiments demonstrate a cell-autonomous effect on autophagy and mitophagy, the microbial activity of thymol may influence the composition of the host microbiome. Interestingly, oregano essential oil is used in animal feed to lower intestinal inflammation and improve immunity by modulating the composition of intestinal microbiota74,75. Transcriptional profiling in MAFs and within a systemic context in skeletal muscle biopsies from SAMP8 mice showed an enrichment of gene signatures compatible with a reduced inflammatory response. Additional studies are warranted to assess the effect of thymol on microbiota, particularly as thymol is believed to be readily absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract and may not reach the distal small intestine76.

In summary, this study broadens the mechanistic understanding of the health benefits mediated by oregano and thyme terpenoids and shows a potential link between their functions as secondary metabolites in plants and their effects on mitochondrial bioenergetics, autophagy and mitophagy in eukaryotic cells. Thymol is present at high concentrations in common oregano and thyme species and can be enriched in oregano essential oils, making it a relatively simple and cost-effective ingredient for nutrition-based prevention. A range of medical conditions are additional avenues to explore, including neurodegenerative diseases characterized by proteotoxicity, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, as well as the spectrum of inherited mitochondrial diseases.

Adult zebrafish of the AB line were raised at 28 °C under standard conditions. All procedures followed the Swiss and EU ethical guidelines and were approved by the ethics committee of the Canton of Vaud (permits VD3177 and VD3546). Transgenic Tg(actc1b:ZsGreen-map1lc3;cryaa:TdTomato) zebrafish were generated using I-SceI meganuclease-mediated insertion into AB embryos at the one-cell stage. The construct included the zebrafish map1lc3 gene tagged with ZsGreen at the 5′ end under the control of the skeletal muscle-specific promoter actc1b. Information on the oligonucleotide sequences based on the zebrafish reference genome GRCz11 is provided in the Supplementary Methods. The line is registered at the Zebrafish Model Organism Database (ZFIN) central repository under the designation Tg(actc1b:ZsGreen-map1lc3;cryaa:TdTomato)nei014 and can be found at https://zfin.org.

All experiments adhered to Swiss regulations on animal experimentation and the European Community Council Directive 2010/63/EU. All procedures were approved by the Nestlé Ethical Committee (ASP-16-38-EXT), the Office Vétérinaire Cantonal Vaudois (VD2770, VD3195 and VD3484), and the Directorate General for Animal Health and Veterinary Drugs of the Italian Ministry of Health (authorization nos. 924/2021-PR and 885/2020-PR). Mice were housed under standard conditions with ad libitum access to food and water. C57BL/6 wild-type mice were purchased from Janvier Labs and were fed either a standard diet (D12450J, Research Diets) or a HFD (D12492, Research Diets). Mito-QC mice were kindly provided by I. Ganley, and SAMP8 AKR/J mice were obtained from Envigo. Thymol was dissolved in corn oil and administered orally. The dose was selected using allometric scaling based on previous pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in mice and humans32,67. For the acute studies, 10-week-old male mito-QC or wild-type mice on a C57BL/6 background received thymol at a dose of 20 mg per kg body weight, followed by a second dose 14 h later. Two hours after the second dose, the mice were killed. Organs from mito-QC mice were postfixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde and 200 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) at 4 °C for 24 h. Tissues were then cryopreserved in 30% sucrose/PBS at 4 °C for 2 days, frozen in chilled isopentane on dry ice and cryosectioned at 8 µm. For chronic treatments, 10-week-old C57BL/6 or 8-month-old SAMP8 male mice received thymol at a dose of 20 mg per kg body weight per day or vehicle (corn oil). The mice were killed at the end of the treatments, and tissues were collected for analysis.

The following C. elegans strains were used in this study: wild-type N2, DA2123 (adIs2122[lgg-1p::GFP::lgg-1+rol-6(su1006)]), CF1038 (daf-16(mu86)), RB2547 (pink-1(ok3538)), TG38 (aak-2(gt33)), QV225 (skn-1(zj15)), RW1596 (stEx30[pmyo-3GFP::MYO-3 + rol-6(su1006)]) and IR2539 (unc-119(ed3); Ex[pmyo‐3TOMM‐20::Rosella; unc‐119(+)]). All strains were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (funded by the National Institutes of Health Office of Research Infrastructure Programs P40 OD010440), except for the strain expressing the mtRosella biosensor, which was a kind gift from the Tavernarakis laboratory in Greece. For RNAi experiments, Escherichia coli HT115 bacteria were transformed with either the pink-1 (RNAi) construct or the empty PL4440 vector. Bacteria were grown overnight in liquid cultures containing ampicillin and tetracycline, followed by subculturing in liquid medium with ampicillin. Cultures were mixed with IPTG (2 mM), seeded onto plates and dried overnight. The next day, the animals were placed on the plates. HT115 bacteria expressing pink-1 (RNAi) were obtained from the Ahringer RNAi library (ID II-4K04).

Human lymphocytic T Jurkat cells (clone E6.1, ATCC, TIB-152) were used to measure autophagic flux in vitro. Cells were grown in complete RPMI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11875093) under standard conditions. For the experiment, cells were washed, counted and incubated at 1 × 105 cells per well in RPMI plus 10% human AB serum (GemCell, GeminiBio, 100-512) in duplicate in a 96-well plate with either rapamycin (Sigma-Aldrich, C2920), thymol (Sigma-Aldrich, 16254), carvacrol (Sigma-Aldrich, W224502), FCCP (Sigma-Aldrich, C2920), or 0.5% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, D8418) as the vehicle.

Primary MAFs were obtained from C57BL/6J or mito-QC mice. Biopsy tissues were cut into small pieces with a scalpel blade and distributed on coated dishes with 1.5 ml DMEM high glucose (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10569010) supplemented with 20% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 100-18B). Thymol (100 μM), carvacrol (100 µM), valinomycin (1 µM) (Sigma-Aldrich, V0627) and oligomycin (1 nM) (Sigma-Aldrich, O4876) were each dissolved in DMSO, added to the cell medium, and left for 24 h.

Three transgenic embryos per well were placed in 96-well plates and treated with compounds diluted in DMSO. After 16 h, the embryos were anesthetized with 0.016% tricaine (Sigma-Aldrich, E10521) and imaged using the ImageXpress Micro Confocal High-Content Imaging System (Molecular Devices). Tricaine was then washed out, and the embryos were treated with 100 mM NH4Cl (Sigma-Aldrich, 09718) for 4 h before being imaged again. For automated imaging, larval images were initially acquired using a 4× objective and analyzed with MetaXpress software (version 6.7.2). A custom Python code has been developed for the automated detection of larvae. The script records the coordinates of an area of the body at a fixed distance from the edges of the tail and the head. Twenty-six Z stacks of each area are acquired using a 20× objective. For the identification and quantification of ZsGreen-LC3 puncta, two-dimensional projections were analyzed. Images were processed as follows: individual Z stacks were projected onto single images using maximal projection. The projection was subsequently smoothed using serial operations, and this smoothed image was then subtracted from the maximal projection to remove the fish background from the puncta signal, resulting in a subtracted image. The smoothed image was then binarized to create the pre-fish body mask, which was cleaned using area filtering. The final object was then shrunk to represent the fish body mask. The mean intensity of the smoothed image covered by the fish body was measured and used to binarize the subtracted image and create the pre-LC3 punctate mask. Finally, an LC3 puncta mask was created by keeping the pre-puncta objects encompassed within the fish body mask. Morphological measurements were recorded from the two final masks. The LC3 punctate total area relative to body surface area was used as a parameter for quantification. Python and MetaXpress codes have been deposited on GitHub and are accessible at https://github.com/giulializzo/zebrafish_high_content_imaging.git.

The OCR in zebrafish larvae was measured using the Seahorse XF24 instrument (Seahorse Bioscience). Larvae were placed in a 24-well islet microplate (XF24 Islet Capture FluxPak no. 101174-100, Seahorse Bioscience), maintained with an islet capture screen and overlaid with 600 µl of egg water without air bubbles. Larvae were allowed to equilibrate for 10 min and maintained at 28.5 °C throughout the entire experiment. Respiration rates were determined every 5 min. Basal respiration was calculated as the average of the last three measurement points (from 40 to 52 min) before the injection of FCCP to a final concentration of 0.8 µM. Uncoupled respiration was determined by the maximum value observed after FCCP injection. Larvae that did not respond to FCCP and exhibited OCR values lower than basal respiration were excluded from the analysis. Rotenone (Sigma-Aldrich, R8875) and antimycin A (Sigma-Aldrich, A8764) were injected at concentrations of 1 µM and 1 µg l−1, respectively, to inhibit the electron transport chain, with residual OCR accounting for nonmitochondrial respiration.

Total proteins were extracted from mouse tissues or from pools of 20 zebrafish larvae at 3 dpf, as described in the Supplementary Methods. For SDS–PAGE, lysates were diluted, mixed with NuPAGE LDS sample buffer and a sample reducing agent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NP0008 and NP0009), and heated at 70 °C for 10 min in heating blocks. Proteins (40 µg) were loaded onto precast NuPAGE Bis–Tris 1.0 mm Midi Protein Gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific, WG1402 and WBT01020), and electrophoresis was performed for 90 min at 130 V. Gels were incubated in 20% ethanol for 10 min and transferred onto PVDF membranes using the iBlot2 instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Membranes were rehydrated in TBS–Tween (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 28360) and blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS–Tween for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were incubated at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-AMPKα (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, 2532), rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-AMPKα (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, 2535), mouse monoclonal anti-CHOP (1:1,000, Abcam, Ab11419), rabbit polyclonal anti-CLPP (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, 14181), rabbit monoclonal anti-GAPDH (1:5,000, Abcam, Ab181602), mouse monoclonal anti-HSC70 (1:10,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-7298), rabbit polyclonal anti-HSP60 (1:1,000, Abcam, Ab46798), rabbit polyclonal anti-LC3 (1:1,000, Novus Biologicals, NB100-2220), rabbit monoclonal anti-Parkin (1:1,000, Abcam, Ab77924), rabbit polyclonal anti-PINK-1 (1:1,000, Novus Biologicals, BC100-494), mouse monoclonal anti-S6 ribosomal protein (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, 2317), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-S6 (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, 2211), mouse monoclonal anti-SQSTM1/P62 (1:1,000, Abnova, H00008878-M01), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ubiquitin (S65) (1:1,000, Boston Biochem, A110), rabbit polyclonal anti-VDAC-1 (1:1,000, Abcam, Ab15895), rabbit monoclonal anti-vinculin (1:5,000, Abcam, Ab219649) and total OXPHOS Blue Native WB Antibody Cocktail (1:1,000, Abcam, Ab110412). Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG H&L (HRP) secondary antibodies (1:10,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 31460 and 31430) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 32106).

To measure autophagy in Jurkat cells, we used the Guava LC3 antibody-based assay kit (Luminex, FCCH100171), following the manufacturer's instructions. The kit includes reagent A (an inhibitor of lysosomal activity), reagent B (a permeabilization solution) and an anti-LC3 antibody conjugated with FITC (clone 4E-12). Half of the replicates were incubated with reagent A for 30 min before the end of the treatment to block lysosomal degradation of LC3 vesicles, thereby measuring autophagic flux. Cells were then transferred to a 96-well V-bottom plate, permeabilized with reagent B to remove the cytoplasmic form of LC3 (LC3-I) and incubated with the FITC-conjugated LC3 antibody. Samples were then analyzed using a Becton Dickinson LSR Fortessa SORP analyzer. Offline analyses were performed using FCS Express Software (De Novo Software), with results expressed as the median fluorescence intensity in the FITC channel.

MMP and mitochondrial superoxide measurements in Jurkat cells were conducted using flow cytometry. For the MMP, JC-10 was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Enzo Life Sciences, ENZ-52305). Cells were treated with thymol, carvacrol or FCCP for 30 min, and JC-10 staining was added 15 min before analysis. For mitochondrial superoxide measurements, Jurkat cells were incubated with MitoSOX Red (5 µM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, M36008) for 20 min before acquisition. Samples were analyzed using a Becton Dickinson LSR Fortessa SORP flow cytometry analyzer. Offline analyses were performed using FCS Express Software (De Novo Software). The gating strategy is described in the Supplementary Methods.

In MAFs, the MMP was assessed by TMRM and MitoTracker costaining. Thymol or carvacrol (100 μM) was added to the medium and left for 24 h. Untreated cells received an equal volume of DMSO. Oligomycin (1 nM) was used to prevent proton efflux and depolarization. For MMP measurement, cells were grown in a 24-well glass-bottom plate in the presence of conditioned medium for 24 h, then costained with TMRM (20 nM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, T668) and MitoTracker Deep Red (100 nM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, M22426). Following a 30-min incubation in the dark at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with dye-free conditioned medium. TMRM and MitoTracker signals were analyzed using a TCS SP8 confocal microscope (Leica Biosystems), as described in the Supplementary Methods.

After dissection, liver tissue was rapidly cut into small pieces with scissors and placed in ice-cold medium A (0.32 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris–HCl, 1 mM EDTA; pH adjusted to 7.4). The pieces were transferred into a 5-ml Dounce homogenizer (glass–Teflon) at a ratio of 5 ml of medium A per 1 g of tissue. After four to six strokes at 600 rpm on ice, the suspension was transferred into a 15-ml Falcon tube and centrifuged at 1,000g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred into 2-ml microtubes and centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet containing mitochondria was resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold medium A. The mitochondrial protein concentration was then determined using the BCA method (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23225).

The OCR in mitochondria isolated from mouse livers was measured using high-resolution respirometry (OROBOROS Oxygraph-2k, Oroboros Instruments). For respirometry analysis, 150 µg of crude mitochondrial extract was added to modified MiR05 buffer (110 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl2, 20 mM taurine, 10 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM HEPES and 0.1% BSA essentially fatty acid free) in a 2-ml chamber at 37 °C. Respiration in isolated mitochondria was determined using SUIT (substrate–uncoupler–inhibitor titration) protocols, with modifications. Pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich, P2256, 5 mM), glutamate (Sigma-Aldrich, G1626, 10 mM) and malate (Sigma-Aldrich, M1000, 2 mM) were used as substrates for inducing complex I respiration in the presence of ADP (Sigma-Aldrich, A5285, 1 mM). A 2-µl volume of thymol solution (50 mM thymol in ethanol) was repeatedly injected to reach incremental concentrations of thymol in the respirometry chamber. The second (control) chamber was injected with the same volume of carrier (ethanol) alone. After a sufficient number of titration steps, respiration was halted by the addition of the complex I inhibitor rotenone (Sigma-Aldrich, R8875, 0.5 µM). Values obtained were normalized to the baseline respiration measured in the control chamber.

Total RNA was extracted as described in the Supplementary Methods. Total RNA (75 ng; 8.9 < RNA quality number < 10) was used to generate the libraries using the QuantSeq 3′ mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit FWD for Illumina (Lexogen, 015.384) following 20 cycles of PCR amplification. Libraries were quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen kit (Invitrogen, Q33140) on a FilterMax F3. The size pattern was assessed using the Fragment Analyzer 96 system with the High Sensitivity NGS Fragment Analysis Kit (Agilent Technologies, DNF-474-0500). Libraries were pooled at an equimolar ratio at a concentration of 40 nM, and sequencing was performed by loading a concentration of 650 pM with a P3 50 kit for 65 cycles on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 platform (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Body composition was measured using nuclear magnetic resonance with the Minispec device (Bruker). Lean body mass and body fat were recorded and normalized to total body weight. OGTT was performed on mice that had been fasted for 6 h. Tail vein glucose levels were measured using a Contour glucometer (Ascensia Diabetes Care) immediately before glucose administration and at 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after glucose administration (1 g glucose per kg body weight). Plasma insulin levels before glucose administration and at 15, 30 and 60 min after glucose administration during the OGTT procedure were quantified from heparinized plasma samples using an ultrasensitive ELISA kit (Crystal Chem, 90080).

The Triglyceride-Glo Assay kit (Promega, J3160) was used to measure triglyceride levels in mouse liver homogenates. Homogenates were prepared from 40 mg of liver tissue in 1 ml ice-cold PBS, using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen) at a frequency of 30 oscillations per second for 2 min. The homogenates were subsequently centrifuged at 1,000g at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was used for the triglyceride assay according to the manufacturer's instructions.

For experiments on plates, C. elegans strains were cultured at 20 °C on nematode growth medium (NGM) agar plates seeded with the E. coli strain OP50. Thymol and carvacrol were mixed into the agar medium before the plates were poured. DMSO was used as a control (maximum concentration of 0.4% for 100 µM). Fresh plates were prepared weekly, and animals were transferred to freshly seeded plates daily after reaching the L4 stage.

For pharmacological treatment on chips, worms were exposed to carvacrol, thymol or 1% DMSO in liquid NGM medium with heat-killed E. coli OP50 (20 mg ml−1). Compounds were dissolved in DMSO and prepared at a 2× concentration in liquid NGM. On the day of treatment, the 2× stock was diluted to the final concentration with liquid NGM containing heat-killed E. coli OP50. Once the animals reached the L4 stage, they were loaded into microfluidic chips (Infinity Chips, NemaLife) and maintained on a diet of heat-killed E. coli OP50 for 24 h. On day 1 of adulthood, worms were treated with the appropriate compound or 1% DMSO. Medium exchange was performed daily to maintain consistent exposure until the end of the assays.

The number of autophagosomes was assessed in the DA2123 C. elegans strain that expresses GFP::LGG-1, with autophagosomes detected as GFP+ puncta. Animals were collected, washed to remove bacteria and anesthetized using metamizole at a final concentration of 20 mM. The animals were then placed on slides and observed under the 40× lens of a Leica DM5500 upright microscope. Mitophagy was measured using a strain that expresses the mtRosella biosensor in the mitochondria of body wall muscle cells. Mitophagy was calculated as the ratio of pH-insensitive DsRed to pH-sensitive GFP, as previously described77.

For the healthspan assay, one 90-s video per chip was recorded for each time point. The activity score analysis involved determining the fraction of pixels (representing a worm within a bounding box) that changed over 30 s. Highly active animals that completely moved their bodies out of the bounding box were assigned a score of 1, whereas completely inactive animals received a score of 0. Animals with intermediate scores still had a portion of their bodies remaining in the bounding box after 30 s. For thermotolerance assays, L4 animals and C. elegans carrying deletions of daf-16, pink-1, aak-2 and skin-1 were loaded into microfluidic chips at 20 °C with NGM. On day 1 of adulthood, the medium was exchanged with NGM containing the appropriate treatment, and the animals were allowed to grow until day 3 of adulthood. Subsequently, the animals were exposed to a 37 °C heat shock for 4 h, followed by recovery and scoring for the number of alive animals in the chips.

The mean speed and distance crawled by C. elegans on the plate were measured on day 10 of adulthood using the Movement Tracker software, as previously described78. Lifespan tests were performed at 20 °C, and the worms were monitored daily for survival. Worms were considered to have died if they failed to respond to gentle prodding with a platinum wire. Lifespan data were recorded until all the worms had died. Lifespan metrics were calculated and analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method.

RW1596 animals were grown on NGM plates seeded with E. coli OP50 bacteria and containing either thymol, carvacrol or vehicle. The animals were maintained on these plates until day 10 of adulthood, after which they were collected, washed to remove bacteria and anesthetized with tetramisole at a final concentration of 20 mM. They were then placed on slides and observed under the 40× lens of a Leica DM5500 upright microscope.

At least 200 muscle cells were counted for each condition. Muscle cells containing broken myofibrils or myofibrils with abnormal orientation were classified as damaged, while those with intact myofibrils showing normal, parallel orientation were classified as normal. Finally, the percentage of damaged myofibers relative to the total number of myofibers was calculated.

DNA extraction was performed on 100 mg of muscle tissue using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit, following the manufacturer's recommendations. DNA was quantified using DropSense technology (Unchained Labs). Bisulfite conversion was performed on 500 ng of DNA using the Zymo EZ DNA methylation kit, following the manufacturer's instructions. Converted DNA (200 ng) was used to proceed with the Infinium HD Methylation Assay Protocol, following the manufacturer's recommendations. DNA methylation data were generated using custom arrays (HorvathMammalMethyl40, Illumina) and scanned on an iScan reader (Illumina). Biological age was quantified based on a pan-tissue epigenetic clock algorithm52.

Endurance was evaluated using a treadmill apparatus (Ugo Basile) with a gradually accelerating protocol, starting at 5 rpm for 2 min and increasing to 50 m s−1 over 2,700 s. The test was terminated by exhaustion, defined as ten falls per minute in the motivational air puff.

Weakness was assessed by measuring forelimb grip strength using a grip strength meter (Ugo Basile). Mice grasped the grid with their forelimbs and were gently pulled away by holding the base of their tails. Measurements were recorded in triplicate, and the average was used for the analysis.

The Y maze task was used to measure spontaneous alternation behavior. Mice were introduced to the center of the maze and allowed to explore the three arms for 6 min. The number of triads was recorded to calculate the percentage of alternation. An entry was defined when all four limbs were within an arm.

A rotarod apparatus (Ugo Basile) was used to assess coordination skills. After two acclimation sessions, the apparatus was set to a starting velocity of 4 rpm and an acceleration rate of 20 rpm per minute. Mice underwent three trial sessions at least 20 min apart, and the latency to fall was recorded for each mouse.

For histochemical analysis, tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen-precooled isopentane. The tibialis anterior muscle was cut into 12-μm sections at −25 °C, and the sections were thaw-mounted on slides. The slides were dried at room temperature and stained using a monoclonal anti-laminin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, L9393) diluted 1:100 and a goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor 405) secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A48254) diluted 1:500 for detection. Livers were cryodissected at 8 µm and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde. The ORO stock stain was prepared by dissolving 0.5 g of ORO (Sigma-Aldrich, O0625) in 100 ml of isopropanol. The working solution was prepared by diluting 30 ml of the stock with 20 ml of distilled water. Liver tissues were cut into 2-mm-thick slices, fixed in formalin, paraffinized and hydrated. After deparaffinization and rehydration with xylene and ethanol, the slides were stained with ORO working solution for 15 min, rinsed with 60% isopropanol and lightly stained with hematoxylin for 4 min. After rinsing with distilled water, the slides were mounted. Lipid droplets were stained red and assessed using an Olympus VS120 slide scanner. The size of lipid droplets per field was calculated based on the average size of lipid droplets in ten fields from each mouse liver slide, using the multipoint function of ImageJ.

Raw counts were mapped to the mouse reference genome (GRCm38-101) using STAR (v.2.5.3) and counted using HTSeq-count (v.0.6.1). Data were checked for quality, and no outliers were detected in the principal component analysis. A filter was applied to select only genes with a minimum of 30 reads in at least six samples (corresponding to a threshold of 3.809 on the count per million values), and nonannotated genes were discarded. A total of 10,697 features were retained using these filtering criteria. To account for composition bias between libraries, we applied TMM (trimmed mean of M-value) normalization79. Differential expression analysis between groups was performed using edgeR (v.4.2.1), which estimates gene-wise negative binomial dispersions by calculating the adjusted profile log-likelihood for each gene and maximizing it using the weighted likelihood empirical Bayes method80. A quasi-likelihood negative binomial generalized log-linear model was fitted to the count data, and a gene-wise empirical Bayes quasi-likelihood F test was conducted for each comparison. Resulting P values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg correction method.

Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the Camera function in the edgeR package81, which conducts a competitive test to assess whether the genes in the set are highly ranked in terms of differential expression relative to genes not in the set, while accounting for intergene correlation. Camera was applied to the hallmark pathways from the mouse MSigDB82. The Fry algorithm from edgeR was applied to assess the enrichment of a preselected list of pathways. Fry is a fast approximation of a rotation gene set test that performs self-contained gene set tests to assess whether any of the genes in the set are differentially expressed83. P values are obtained through simulation, followed by adjustment for multiple testing.

For each coverslip containing mito-QC fibroblasts or tissues, ten random images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope with a 63× oil immersion objective. Images were processed with ImageJ using a custom macro, as described in the Supplementary Methods.

GraphPad Prism software version 9.0 (GraphPad Software) was used to perform all statistical analyses as indicated in the main text and figure legends, except for the gene expression and pathway analyses. Bar graphs show means ± s.e.m. Box plot elements show the following data: median (center line), upper and lower quartiles (box limits), minimum and maximum values (whiskers), and points. Differences between two groups were assessed using Student's t test. Differences among more than two groups were assessed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The interaction between two factors was tested using a two-way ANOVA. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. Survival analysis in zebrafish and worms was performed using the Kaplan–Meier method, and pairwise comparisons were conducted using the log-rank test. For high-content imaging, zebrafish larvae that were displaced during acquisition, resulting in undetectable LC3-positive puncta, were excluded from the analysis. No randomization method was used in zebrafish, cell or worm experiments. Mice were randomized using simple randomization based on body weight within the experimental groups. All phenotyping experiments in mice were conducted with the experimenters blinded to the treatment, and data analyses were performed without knowledge of the experimental conditions. Chronic mouse interventions were performed once, but they followed blinding and randomization to ensure reproducibility. For mouse studies, animals that showed weight loss greater than 20%, those found dead in their cages, and those displaying signs of infection and inflammation in their wounds were killed and excluded from the study.

For the worm and zebrafish experiments, the researchers performing the assays were blinded to the treatment. Histopathology, confocal imaging and image analysis were performed in a blinded manner. For all other experiments, blinding was not formally conducted. For short-term thymol supplementation studies in mice, the sample size was determined based on previous publications to detect significant changes in mitophagy or autophagy induction, as measured by the mitophagy index or the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, respectively38,84. For the metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease model, the sample size was similar to that reported in other studies85. For the SAMP8 study, treadmill performance exhibited the greatest variability among all the parameters considered. Based on pilot studies, a 20% decline in motor performance was expected between 8 and 11 months of age. With a study power (β) set at 0.80, an α error of 0.05, and assumptions of a halt in motor decline from the start of treatment and a 25% mortality rate, a sample size of 15 animals per group was deemed necessary. SAMP8 mice that died before the end of the experiment were excluded from subsequent analyses. For C. elegans studies, sample sizes were determined based on previous publications42,86. For all representative images showing cells, zebrafish or C. elegans, experiments were repeated a minimum of three times independently and checked to ensure the reproducibility of the results. The graphics used in the schemata throughout the paper were created using BioRender.com.

While there's growing evidence that psychedelic drugs can effectively treat severe mental health conditions, especially in cases where traditional treatments have failed, they still come with downsides.

Their hallucinogenic effects can be scary and overwhelming, with dosing sessions lasting several hours. Good treatment is heavily reliant on the individual's mindset going into a session and the environment in which they receive it. And though it's rare, psychedelics can sometimes worsen existing mental illness.

Mindstate Design Labs is one of a slate of new companies aiming to make safer psychedelics by removing the classic “trip” associated with them. The company is using AI to help design psychedelic-like drugs that induce specific mental states without hallucinations, and its first compound looks promising.

“We created the least psychedelic psychedelic that's psychoactive,” says CEO Dillan DiNardo. “It is quite psychoactive, but there are no hallucinations.”

Founded in 2021 and backed by Y Combinator and the founders of OpenAI, Neuralink, Instacart, Coinbase, and Twitch, Mindstate has built a set of AI models that connect biochemical data from different psychactive drugs to more than 70,000 “trip reports” compiled from a variety of sources—from official clinical trial datasets and drug forums to social media, Reddit, and even the dark web.

The platform's analysis of how psychedelics produce different effects led to the development of its first drug candidate, MSD-001, a proprietary oral formulation of 5-MeO-MiPT, also known by the street name moxy. In Phase I trial results shared with WIRED, the drug was safe and well tolerated at five different doses in 47 healthy participants. It also produced psychoactive effects without inducing a mind-bending trip, which the company says is a validation of its AI platform.

While participants reported heightened emotions, associative thinking, enhanced imagination, and perceptual effects such as colors looking brighter, they did not experience hallucinations, self-disintegration, oceanic boundlessness and other typical features of a psychedelic trip.

The company measured the drug's effects with validated scales used in psychedelic research and asked participants subjective questions such as “Are you happy?” and “Are you sad?” Researchers also observed volunteers' eye movement and stability, and they performed brain imaging before, during, and after psychoactive effects. Using that brain imaging data, the company was able to determine that the drug produced many of the same brain-wave patterns associated with psilocybin and other first-generation psychedelics. “The drug is getting into the brain and doing what we intend it to do,” DiNardo says.

Psychoactive effects began within about 30 minutes after participants took the drug, with peak intensity occurring at about an hour and a half to two hours. The company reports no serious adverse events.

The trial, which took place at the Centre for Human Drug Research in the Netherlands, included a mix of individuals who had tried psychedelics in the past and others who hadn't.

Mindstate's approach is based on the idea that a psychedelic “trip” might not be necessary for therapeutic benefit. Psychedelics work on the brain's serotonin system by promoting neuroplasticity, which involves the growth of neurons and the formation of new connections. Some researchers believe that this ability to stimulate neuroplasticity, rather than the hallucinogenic effects, is the key to treating mental illness.

Mindstate chose MSD-001 because it targets the serotonin 2a receptor and doesn't seem to interact with multiple sites in the brain, like other psychedelics do. “The thesis was, if we essentially stripped out all of those other biochemical interactions, we'd be left with a drug that was quite tofu-like by psychedelic standards,” DiNardo says.

Mindstate's idea is to use this “psychedelic tofu” as a base that will be combined with other drugs to achieve precise states of consciousness. For its first combination, DiNardo says, the company is aiming to make a drug that reduces anxiety, increases insight, and upregulates aesthetic perception. The company hasn't decided on an exact indication but is considering using the combination to treat mood disorders, compulsive disorders, and phobias.

Of course, Mindstate's work is still early-stage. But if its drug is successful in future trials, the company will have to figure out how to navigate the regulatory hurdles of getting a psychedelic compound approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Last year, the FDA rejected MDMA-assisted therapy for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. After an FDA advisory committee questioned the long-term efficacy of the treatment and the nature of the talk therapy given during the MDMA sessions, the agency asked for an additional late-stage trial to further study safety and efficacy.

Other companies that are pursuing psychedelics, as well as Mindstate, plan to uncouple the drug from talk therapy and ask the FDA only to evaluate the drug. DiNardo envisions Mindstate's drugs being administered similarly to the depression treatment Spravato, a form of ketamine—under the supervision of a health care provider who monitors the patient to ensure safety but isn't guiding them through a talk therapy session, as in the case of Lykos.

“These findings suggest that a mild psychedelic experience, one without hallucinations, could make for a safe and potentially therapeutic experience, especially if it is catalyzed through a process of psychological support,” says Alan Davis, director of the Center for Psychedelic Drug Research at Ohio State University.

Davis says a “safer” psychedelic could be used in individuals who are currently excluded from psychedelic therapy trials, such as those with psychotic disorders, personality disorders, or other conditions where it may not be safe to administer a classic psychedelic drug.

Rachel Yehuda, director of the Parsons Research Center for Psychedelic Healing at Mount Sinai Health System, says Mindstate's AI platform is an interesting approach to drug discovery, but she doesn't consider the drug the company tested to be a psychedelic. “There are lots of drugs that are mood altering that are not psychedelic drugs,” she says. “Psychedelics are valuable because of their richness, their unpredictability, and the depth that comes from engaging with unconscious material.”

People who have taken psychedelics often report that the visions and altered state they experience during a trip allow greater emotional processing, helping them make sense of difficult or traumatic events that have happened to them. Psychedelics can cause individuals to have revelations about themselves or to reevaluate their lives in a new way.

But not everyone seeking relief from a psychiatric disorder may want to experience those intense side effects. “A lot of people who are suffering from depression and anxiety just want to feel better,” Yehuda says. “And that's OK.”

By the early 1990s, most of Coke's drinks across the US were being sold in disposable cans and PET bottles. Returnable glass made up less than 1 percent of what it sold in the US. Yet the company still wanted to hang on to the wholesome image evoked by its contour glass bottle.

Coca-Cola's advertising sought to evoke nostalgia, and for this the company used imagery of the old hobble-skirt glass bottle, often ice-cold with beads of condensation dripping down it. It had used the distinctive bottle since 1916. Also called the “Mae West” bottle after the American actress's famously curvaceous figure, the shape was arguably the most recognized corporate symbol in the world. The company's CEO, Doug Ivester, was convinced that Coke needed to keep the contour bottle high in the public's imagination.

Hailing from New Holland—a small village in Georgia built for cotton mill workers—Ivester had started out life with modest ambitions. As a young teenager, he had worked the cash register and carried bags for customers at the Kroger store in Gainesville. He had longed to buy a swanky car like the 1964 Pontiac GTO driven by a regular customer. The man told Ivester that he was a certified public accountant. That car spurred the future Coke CEO to get an accounting degree.

“The bridge from growing up in that modest environment to having what I considered to be a good income-producing job was a CPA,” Ivester says. “I knew some people who had done it. They were successful and happy, they had good lives and didn't need to be multimillionaires.” Ivester spent a decade at an accounting firm, Ernst and Ernst, where much of his time was taken up by Coke, his main client.

In 1979, he joined the drinks giant's auditing department, putting in the same long hours he had at Ernst. His hard work paid off; six years later, at the age of 37, he became Coke's chief financial officer. Then, in 1989, the company's Cuba-born CEO Roberto Goizueta appointed Ivester as Coke's head of Europe. His time abroad was short-lived. While Ivester was still apartment hunting during his first year in Europe, Coke's US president, Ira Herbert, started having heart problems. One day, Goizueta phoned Ivester in his hotel room to say Herbert was soon to retire. “I need you back here to take Ike's place,” Goizueta told him.

Soon after returning to Coke headquarters in Atlanta, Ivester made it his mission to renew Coke's focus on the contour bottle, convinced it would help sales. While the company was doing brisk business overseas, growth at home was sluggish.

“I was concerned about the loss of brand imagery,” Ivester says. “I felt the contour bottle was a major conveyor of image and quality. It conveyed heritage and all the right things.”

He charged a 29-year-old marketing executive, Susan McWhorter, with figuring out whether Coke could make a contour plastic bottle.

“You can segregate people into two groups. There's the problems group—that says let me tell you all the problems we're facing—and the solutions group,” Ivester says. “Susan was a solutions person.”

McWhorter had gone to Ivester's alma mater, the University of Georgia, and had long idealized her now employer. As a child, she'd spend all week looking forward to the icy bottle of Coke her grandmother gave her every Saturday at 11 am. At age 7, McWhorter's payment for sweeping up hair at Wilma's beauty parlour in her hometown of Ocilla was a 6.5-ounce returnable bottle of Coke.

McWhorter polled consumers, who indicated that they'd prefer contour bottles over straight-walled ones by a margin of five to one.

Younger consumers saw the bottle as modern and different, while older people who remembered the shape associated it with quality. Consumer interest confirmed, Ivester wanted not just a plastic replica of the glass bottle, but a much larger version. Over the years, Coke had steadily increased the sizes of its fountain drinks. A large soda now stood at 20 ounces, a full 4 ounces bigger than the previous iteration. “We were really training consumers at that time to drink more and more,” says McWhorter.

Coke didn't have to charge consumers much more because the profit margin on fountain soda was so much higher than on bottles and cans. The huge fountain sodas paved the way for the company to slowly but surely reshape consumer expectations, creating a thirst among Americans for larger amounts of soda, across every packaging type.

“The consumers just ordered a large,” explains McWhorter. “They didn't know whether it had 16 ounces or 20 ounces in it. For us, the thinking was, ‘We sell more, we make more, so let's size up.'”

Ivester instructed McWhorter to find a way to make a 20-ounce plastic bottle that looked like the original 6.5-ounce glass one without compromising the design's integrity.

But sizing up was looking expensive. For one thing, the bottle manufacturers needed to use extra plastic to give the curvy bottle added reinforcement. Curvy bottles also couldn't be blown as quickly as straight ones. The bottles wobbled on filling lines. Bottlers trialling them pumped in just 10 percent of the liquid they usually filled in a day. Modifying the filling equipment could cost a bottler between $1 million and $2 million. Yet the payoffs were uncertain, and Coke's recent track record was anything but reassuring.

Ivester had only recently pushed bottlers to get behind a clear, sugar-free soda intended to compete with a clear, colorless Pepsi. Coke called it Tab Clear and Ivester told reporters the product would be “marketed for what it is: a study in contradictions.” But the marketing confused people. They didn't recall the ads. The key message—that Tab Clear had a “mysterious flavor”—didn't resonate. Tab Clear's many critics said it looked like lemonade but tasted like weak cola. By late 1993, about a year after Tab Clear's launch, Goizueta was hinting that the product was dead.

“We were going into an environment where bottlers said, ‘Yeah, we've seen all this research from the company on how great things are going to be. We've done all this work, but it doesn't pay off,'” says McWhorter.

To win over the bottlers, Ivester knew he needed to put his money where his mouth was. “Coke will loan you the money for the conversion of your lines,” he told them. “If you execute the marketing plan Susan and her team give you and don't meet the target numbers, I'll forgive those loans.”

Ivester was taking a gamble. Coca-Cola was ploughing tens of millions of dollars into modifying the bottlers' lines, which meant the amount of soda it sold needed to jump significantly to cover the added costs.

The plastic contour bottle, the company told investors, will “invite consumers to drink more Coca-Cola, more often and in larger sizes.”

In January 1993, Coke launched the plastic contour bottle in test markets in Alabama and Tennessee. Sales jumped 25 percent. “For more than 75 years, our contour bottle design has been the unparalleled symbol of quality,” Ivester said when announcing the launch. “The new 20-ounce package preserves that heritage while offering the convenience of a recyclable plastic package to today's consumer.” The plastic contour bottle, the company told investors, will “invite consumers to drink more Coca-Cola, more often and in larger sizes.”

The Wall Street Journal dismissed the bottle as a “marketing gimmick,” in an article titled “New 20-Ounce, Plastic Version Is Trying to Be Nostalgic and Hip at the Same Time.” Unsurprisingly, Pepsi denigrated the bottle, telling the Journal: “The more nostalgic Coke gets, the more Pepsi looks progressive, from an image standpoint.”

But Coke saw the potential for its new drink packaging to be far more than just a container. “We call it unleashing a powerful marketing tool that touches consumers where our competitors cannot—in the palms of their hands,” the company's chief marketing officer Sergio Zyman told a trade magazine.

Retailers loved the new bottle, handing over large chunks of shelf space to Coke. Profit margins on single bottles of Coke were significantly higher than on ones that came in packs. The contour bottle was aimed at growing this single-serve segment, targeted at people on the go.

Consumers loved it too. Coke's sales volumes jumped as much as 90 percent in parts of the US where the bottle had been launched. The results were beyond anything the company had expected.

By September 1994, Coca-Cola told investors that it was on track to post its largest sales volume of any quarter in the past five years. Ivester rolled the bottle out nationally. Coca-Cola forecast that total sales of 20-ounce Coke in plastic bottles for that year would jump 50 percent from the year before when only straight-sided bottles were offered. “Contour is a brand in and of itself,” boasted Ivester.

Through the 1990s, the returnable glass bottle's already tiny share of all carbonated soft drink sales in the US dwindled. By the decade's end, it stood at 0.2 percent.

If you're looking for a new set of bedsheets, Amazon is a convenient place to get a new set delivered fast. The best sheets on Amazon come from brands we know and love, and shopping brands you're familiar with is one of many ways to avoid shoddy products on the ecommerce site.

Sheets are a category where you can't get away with low quality, at least in the long term; it's best to invest in sheets with strong fibers that will last, and that are a legit brand that won't mix in harmful chemicals or take shortcuts on the sheets. This guide includes all our favorites we've tested that happen to be on Amazon, from cotton percale and sateen to bamboo and Tencel lyocell. We don't recommend any microfiber or polyester sheets in this guide, since they're lower quality and usually run warmer, too, so hot sleepers (like myself!) would be miserable.

If you're looking for a great cotton sheet on Amazon, Buffy's Supima Cotton Sheet Set ($195) is one of my all-time favorite percale sheets to stay cool and still feel soft to the touch thanks to the Supima cotton used. Brooklinen's sheets are also available on Amazon, including its silky Luxe Sateen Core Set ($149) and its Organic Cotton Core Sheet Set ($239). Looking for something cheaper? Bedsure's GentleSoft Cooling Sheets ($70) and Laura Ashley's Cotton Flannel Bedding ($42) are a great price and comfortable to sleep on.

Looking for more bedding ideas? Don't miss our guides to the Best Bamboo Sheets, Best Cooling Sheets, and Best Linen Sheets. Looking for bedding beyond sheets? We've got guides to the Best Mattresses, Best Mattresses for Back Pain, Best Pillows, Best Mattress Toppers, and Best Down Comforters.

Buffy

Amazon

Buffy

One of my favorite bedding brands you can find on Amazon is Buffy. The brand is known for its eucalyptus bedding that's cool to the touch, and this percale sheet set is its newest addition to the lineup and first foray into cotton. Buffy's percale is just as comfy for keeping you cool, since it's a super breathable weave. It's softer than most other percale sheets, since it uses Supima cotton, a certified long-staple cotton that lets these sheets have a light thread count but still feel soft to the touch. It's one of my favorite cotton sheets, and you can always find them on Amazon. The only downside is they're usually on sale on Buffy's site, rather than on Amazon.

Brooklinen

Amazon

Brooklinen

Brooklinen's Luxe Sateen sheets are a great set of cotton sheets you can find on Amazon, with a silkier feel thanks to the three-over-one thread pattern that makes up a sateen weave. That style makes the sheets silky and cool to the touch, and these are silkier than cheaper options, like JCPenney's popular set. This set also has a higher thread count of 480, which helps them feel super soft, and Brooklinen says this set uses long-staple cotton too. That thread count and thicker weave also means they'll run a little warmer than lighter cotton, so I like these best for fall and spring nights.

Bedsure

Amazon

Bedsure

WIRED reviewer Julia Forbes can't stop raving about Bedsure's bamboo sheets, and it's easy to see why. The bamboo rayon sheets are comfortable, cooling, and durable, lasting her for years, all for a great price. Bamboo in general is a big favorite of ours when it comes to bedding, and these sheets from Bedsure are our budget pick in our guide to the Best Bamboo Sheets. But even if you're not (yet) bamboo-obsessed like we are, if you're shopping on Amazon to find great sheets on a budget, there really isn't a better set to find at this price point.

Laura Ashley

Amazon

The cheapest sheets I've ever liked from Amazon are actually a lightweight flannel. These affordable, soft sheets from Laura Ashley remind me of the popular L.L. Bean flannel; both are a lightweight flannel compared to thicker sets, and feel akin to brushed cotton (which is similar, but not the same as full flannel—think half flannel). I love that this set comes in a wide variety of colors and prints, though price can vary depending on the style you choose. And even with such a cheap price point, these sheets are still Oeko-Tex certified.

Slumber Cloud

Slumber Cloud

Amazon

As a hot sleeper, I'm obsessed with these sheets. I grab the Slumber Cloud Performance Tencel Sheet Set whenever it might be a little hot at night (which is often, since I live in Southern California) to keep myself and my husband cool all night long. These sheets use the Tencel lyocell, which is a fiber made from wood pulp that's silky and cool to the touch after being processed into fiber, and Slumber Cloud's patented Outlast fiber, which uses phase-change material (PCM) gel to absorb heat. It actually works, which shocked me. Every other set I've tried that promises PCM to keep me cool has left me with night sweats worse than if I'd slept on a regular cotton or linen sheet set. These sheets have lasted well through my constant use of them over the last year, and they are available on Amazon.

Brooklinen

Amazon

Brooklinen

This is another percale set, but unlike Buffy's set above, it's made from Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)-certified organic cotton and is Oeko-Tex certified, making it an organic bedsheet. This cotton sheet set has the nice, crisp feel that percale is known for, like fresh hotel bedding, and has a 270-thread count that helps keep it super light and breathable. Brooklinen's Organic Cotton Sheets are a touch softer than the brand's regular percale, but they still really embody that light, slightly stiff feeling you'll want if you're a percale fan.

Boll & Branch Signature Sheets for $259: I love this brand's flannel, and this signature sheet set is a solid choice as well (though pricey compared to other cotton sheet sets I prefer).

Buffy Eucalyptus Lyocell Sheet Set for $200: This set uses lyocell made from eucalyptus trees for a similar feel to bamboo sheets—silky and chilly to the touch. It's another unique cooling option, and great for folks who love soft bedding.

Cariloha Classic Bamboo Sheet Set for $239: For being Cariloha's cheapest set, it still feels fantastic to sleep on and delivers on the softness and comfort you want in a good bamboo sheet. Upgrade to Cariloha's Retreat Sheets ($289) if you want a securing strap, which is handy for silky bamboo.

Coyuchi Organic Crinkled Percale Sheet Set for $189: I love a few different sets from Coyuchi, but none of the ones we've tested are available on Amazon. Still, it's a good organic brand, so swinging for the crinkled percale and classic sateen ($178) will likely leave you satisfied.

Cozy Earth Bamboo Sheet Set for $330: This is a big favorite in the bamboo world for the super-cozy, silky soft feel. It's unlike any other bamboo set I've tried. It's a splurge, but truly worth it if you love a cozy-soft feel and want sheets that feel cool to the touch at the same time (but warm up nicely as you sleep).

Ettitude Signature Sateen Bamboo Sheets for $333: These are an impressively decorated set of bamboo sheets, with certifications from Oeko-Tex, the Forest Stewardship Council, Eco-Cert, and B-Corp. Bamboo doesn't have the same organic certifications yet that you can find on linen and cotton, but this is the closest combo you'll get. These sheets are also super soft yet still very breathable, and my favorite bamboo for hot sleepers and organic shoppers.

Amazon Basics Microfiber Sheet Set for $20: We wanted to like these cheap sheets made by Amazon, but this set is a major skip. This set both felt and sounded like the paper robes you wear at the doctor's office, and our testers hardly managed sleeping on these for a single night.

Coop Comphy Cool+ Sheet Set for $219: This set promises cooling properties, but I found myself waking up sweating after sleeping on these, which isn't a huge surprise after seeing they're made of nylon, polyester, and spandex, none of which are as breathable as simple linen or cotton.

Rest Evercool+ Cooling Starter Sheet Set for $299: These are supposed to be cooling sheets, but I found myself waking up feeling moisture trapped around me. Whatever's in Rest's proprietary cooling fabric didn't work for me at all.

For life on Earth, the oceans are essential. Not only do they supply us with food and resources, they also play a big role in maintaining a stable climate: between one-quarter to one-third of all CO2 emitted by humans, which would otherwise stay in the atmosphere to further intensify climate change, is captured and stored by the sea.

But the oceans are in trouble. Already facing an onslaught of human pressures—including overfishing, pollution, rising temperatures, and acidification—the world's seas could see the burden placed on them double over the next couple of decades. This would have huge negative consequences for biodiversity as well as for humans around the world.

An international team, led by the National Center for Ecosystem Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at the University of California, Santa Barbara, has modeled how the pressure placed on the world's oceans could change in the future. Their analysis projects that by around 2050, the cumulative pressure on the oceans could increase 2.2- to 2.6-fold compared to today. The most rapid increases in impact will occur near the equator, at the poles, and in coastal areas.

“Our cumulative impact on the oceans, which is already substantial, is going to double by 2050—in just 25 years,” Ben Halpern, marine ecologist and director of NCEAS, explained in a university statement. “It's sobering. And it's unexpected, not because impacts will be increasing—that is not surprising—but because they will be increasing so much, so fast.”

Halpern and his team, in cooperation with Nelson Mandela University in South Africa, integrated 17 datasets from around the world to create a comprehensive global model of the extent and intensity of the impacts of human activities on the ocean. Past studies have often dealt with the impacts of specific activities in isolation; the current study integrates these activities to more clearly highlight the future vision of the marine environment.

What emerges is a picture of further deterioration in already heavily impacted areas, such as coastal waters, as well as rapidly expanding impacts across the high seas, which have been relatively stable until now. In equatorial regions, the impact of human activities could increase nearly three-fold between the 2040s and 2050s.

Specific major impacts include rising sea temperatures, declining marine resources due to fishing, rising sea levels, acidification of seawater (which is a consequence of CO2 dissolving in the sea), and algal blooms due to the influx of nutrients that flow into the ocean, principally from farms. While these burdens are each serious in isolation, their combined effects could exceed the resilience of ecosystems and lead to irreversible losses.

Researchers warn that this cumulative impact will then hit society—for instance, by lowering food supplies, killing off jobs in tourism and fishing, flooding low-lying lands, and destroying coral reefs that protect coastlines from storm surges and tsunamis. There will be direct impacts on human livelihoods and economies, leading to regional economic instability, Halpern said.

Developing countries and small island nations in particular do not have the economic wherewithal to take adaptation measures, despite their often heavy dependence on marine resources. The cumulative effects will therefore appear unevenly across countries. Oceanic change is not just an environmental issue; it is an issue that concerns the stability of the international community as a whole.

However, the projections of this study are only possibilities; such a future does not have to arrive. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to lessen climate change and ocean acidification, systematically managing fisheries resources, avoiding coastal pollution, and preserving coastal mangroves and salt marshes may help to mitigate the deterioration. There is still room to minimize the impact.

Car owners in San Francisco fed up with parking tickets had a brief moment of respite on Tuesday thanks to a website called Find My Parking Cops. The site kept tabs on where city workers were issuing tickets, showing the locations of parking control officers on a city map in real time.

I'm using the past tense to tell you about it because shortly after the site went live, the real-time data feed powering it went dark.

Before that sad turn of events, and while the buzz around the site was still high, I spoke to the creator, Riley Walz, about how he put it together. Walz is a software engineer known for building stunty websites. He got the idea for this one after looking at all of the information listed on the parking tickets issued by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. Each ticket shows the make of the car, the license number, and so on. But right at the top is the ticket's citation number.

“I figured out that the ticket numbers are predictable,” Walz says, “which means I can efficiently scrape them.”

Walz's website looked quite similar to Apple's Find My feature, a tool sometimes used by iOS owners to track the location of family and friends. But rather than people you know IRL, this site showed the trail of tickets issued by parking enforcers as they zipped around San Francisco in their tiny single-seaters.

The website quickly went viral on social media Tuesday, the same day as its initial release. It enjoyed a few good hours, before the site's functionality vanished: City officials appear to have cut off the sources of data that Walz was using to track parking enforcement.

“In rare lightning speed, the SF government changed their site within hours of this site going live,” reads an announcement Walz added to Find My Parking Cops on Tuesday afternoon. “I can't get data from it anymore.”

“Citations are a tool to ensure compliance with parking laws, which help keep our streets safe and use our limited curb space efficiently and fairly,” an SFMTA representative said in an emailed statement on Tuesday afternoon, after Walz's site was no longer functional. “We welcome creative uses of technology to encourage legal parking, but we also want to make sure that our employees are able to do their jobs safely, and without disruption.”

The idea for Find My Parking Cops was first sparked when Walz's roommate got a parking fine. Walz noticed the nine-digit identification number on the ticket and started looking for patterns. By using publicly available information, he believed he cracked the code.

“It seems each possible ticket number follows a pattern: add 11, except add 4 if the last digit is 6. So, no ticket can end in 7, 8, or 9,” Walz wrote in a blog post explaining the site. “So, the ticket after 984,946,606 is actually 984,946,610, and after that is 984,946,621.”

He suspected this absurd-seeming pattern was due to limitations baked into the software used by parking control officers. Whatever its reason for existing, the pattern of sequential ticket IDs, paired with parking officers likely claiming batches of ticket numbers, meant Walz was able to track their routes by plotting each parking ticket on a map as soon as it was entered into the system. A car owner could look at the activity of the officers currently out on patrol and see if any of them were slowly descending on their neighborhood.

Last year, parking officials in San Francisco issued over a million tickets within city limits, which amounted to over $100 million in fines for car owners. “I actually don't have a car, but I have plenty of friends that talk about it,” says Walz. Like most costs in San Francisco, these tickets can quickly add up. For example, forgetting to move your car during the weekly street sweeping—an error my household has made more than once—will cost you $90 every time.

The website's live updates were pulled from the city government's website and visualized on an Apple Map. Find My Parking Cops tracked the routes of individual parking control officers, giving them each unique visual identifiers, as well as their cadence of tickets.

On Tuesday, for example, the site displayed one officer seemingly starting their shift around 10:30 am and handing out 35 tickets over the next few hours as they patrolled a neighborhood in Lower Pacific Heights. The citations logged were primarily for expired meters, which costs $107 per ticket, and not having a residential permit, which costs $108 per ticket. In total, the fines racked up by that one officer over a few hours amounted to almost $4,000.

Who's handing out the most tickets each week? Walz included a leaderboard on the website that ranked just how much in fines each officer handed out. While officers were only identified on the map by a number and their initials, their cumulative ticket cost was tracked. When WIRED was last able to check Walz's website on Tuesday, the top fine giver had issued 157 tickets so far, handing out over $16,000 in fees for violations.

Prior to Find My Parking Cops, Walz created another San Francisco–specific website. This one used a phone, placed on a street corner in the Mission District, to identify what songs people were listening to in public. He then uploaded a live feed of the songs, captured and identified through the Shazam app, onto the Bop Spotter website. It provided a little peek into what neighborhood residents were bumping at the time while also slyly nodding at the abundance of surveillance in the city. He's also previously built a site, called IMG_0001, to surface old YouTube clips uploaded by everyday people in the platform's early days. Those grainy, private videos stand in stark contrast to the stuff that dominates the platform today.

The parking ticket tracker was another side project for Walz. “I worked in my free time on the weekends the last few weeks to make it happen,” he says.

While Walz's websites sometimes come with a dose of social commentary, he didn't envision this project as making some kind of grand, sweeping statement about parking tickets or what it means to drive in 2025. Rather, it's another entry in his repertoire of cool websites powered by unique data sources.

“I'm not ‘pro' parking cop. I'm not ‘anti' parking cop,” says Walz. “It's just data I was able to unearth, and I thought it would be cool to visualize it.”

And now it's gone. Representatives for Apple did not respond to immediate requests for comment. I reached out to Walz after the city's data feed was cut off, but he didn't pick up.

Solar panels have long been used in consumer tech, from Garmin smartwatches and TV remotes to even a laptop. I've always wondered why there hasn't been a greater push for them. It's free power. What's not to like? Earlier panels may not have been as efficient, but that's no longer the case.

Logitech is no stranger to solar technology. It first made a solar-powered keyboard 15 years ago, the K750, and now the time is ripe for a successor: the Logitech Signature Slim Solar+ K980. Like the original, this keyboard has no USB charging port and is purely powered by ambient lighting. It costs $100 and comes in black, white, or graphite. The simple and utilitarian design will be right at home in a well-lit office space. However, the K980 struggles to compete with similarly priced keyboards in any way besides solar charging.

The Slim Solar+ K980 is a standard office keyboard, and it types like one. It uses a two-piece plastic construction (70 percent post-consumer recycled plastic) with low-profile keys and scissor switches. Ignoring the solar panel, this is an incredibly basic keyboard.

The typing sounds a bit rattly, like most scissor-switch keyboards, and each keypress has a soft, almost squishy feeling instead of the crispness of a low-profile mechanical switch. The typing experience is passable, if not enjoyable, and the low-profile, short-travel switches mean key presses will be quick and familiar to most people.

The biggest gripe I have with this keyboard is the keycaps. The Slim Solar+ K980 uses standard silkscreen printing, as opposed to a more durable method like dye sublimation or double-shot injection. This results in text that is more likely to wear and the presence of a subtle outline around each letter. Compared to other low-profile Logitech keyboards, like the MX Keys line, both the typing experience and the keycap quality feel underwhelming.

This likely won't be an issue for anyone who wants a practical, simple keyboard, especially if you don't care much about typing feel. However, there are countless other keyboards—wired and wireless—that can deliver more enjoyable typing experiences at comparable prices.

The Slim Solar+ K980 has a traditional full-size layout, with a number pad and a separate arrow key cluster. This layout takes up a good amount of space, but it has every key you'll need. The function row can swap between function keys and system controls by pressing Fn + Esc, and the system controls include volume adjustments, play/pause/skip, brightness adjustments, window navigation, an emoji menu, and a key to summon Windows' built-in speech dictation system. All of these are useful and convenient, and the labels are nearly all self-explanatory at a glance.

These shortcut keys can also be customized with the Logi Options+ app, which has extensive productivity-oriented customizations. The most significant is the ability to remap the function row and navigation keys to specific keys, macros, key combinations, or programmed “Smart Actions."" Some of the preconfigured Smart Actions include a “Social Media Break” key to open multiple social media platforms in a new window (not quite what I would have imagined from the name), or a “Work Mode” key that opens Gmail and the Microsoft 365 Suite. These can be customized endlessly, with dedicated support for AI assistants, navigation, and other convenience-oriented commands.

Alongside customization options, there's multi-device connectivity via Bluetooth with support for up to three devices that can be cycled through via dedicated keys. Or you can keep it connected to one device with the included USB-C Logi Bolt receiver. I had no issues with connectivity.

The keyboard has dual Mac and Windows legends on the bottom row, making it easy to switch between two operating systems. (There's also a macOS-only version you can buy.) As the name suggests, the K980 is incredibly slim. It's less than half the thickness of a true mechanical keyboard, with the thickest point measuring 18 millimeters (0.7 inch), and it can easily slip between other items in a backpack. The main issue is length, but that's a problem with all full-size keyboards.

The only way to recharge this keyboard is with the solar panel on top. It doesn't have any kind of USB port. Logitech claims the keyboard's battery can run for four months without any light sources. Presumably, it can run indefinitely in a well-lit environment.

There is an option to check the light level in the Logi Options+ app, where I found that anything not directly next to a window would yield a warning of “insufficient lighting conditions,” noting that the keyboard may lose battery life over time. During my time with this keyboard, using it near a window in “insufficient lighting conditions,” I never saw its battery go below 90 percent.

The low power consumption of this keyboard is its biggest draw: a keyboard that, in theory, will never run out of battery life. But my concern is the potential for failure. There is no option to use it with a wired connection, so if the solar panel stops working or the battery fails, this keyboard essentially becomes a paperweight after four months.

The good thing is, we can look at the original K750. Scouring forums and Reddit, it seems as though the solar panels have performed well since their debut, but the battery degrades and needs replacing. It's great that Logitech used a standard ML2032 coin cell battery that was fairly easy to replace. The K980 uses a small coin battery inside the proprietary housing, which Logitech claims can last up to 10 years, and the company says that if it needs to be replaced after that time, users will be able to source parts from iFixit.

Removing the three adhesive feet at the top, along with the three screws underneath, allows the entire “bump” on the underside of the keyboard to be removed, providing access to the proprietary battery. From there, the battery can be easily removed and replaced.

However, disassembling the entire keyboard requires the removal of both the bottom three adhesive feet and the large sticker in the center of the keyboard, along with multiple plastic clips holding the two halves together. Internally, the keyboard is fairly standard: a main assembly for all of the switches, a smaller printed circuit board (PCB) that holds the Bluetooth module and the proprietary 70-mAh battery, and a massive ribbon cable to connect everything.

Due to a scissor-switch keyboard's construction, where all components are located on the PCB with rubberized domes, replacing the internals of a failed key is incredibly difficult—an issue shared with nearly every nonmechanical low-profile keyboard. Look around at complaints about the original K750, and you'll find grumblings of keys failing over the years, so this could be a real problem.

Ultimately, this is an office keyboard. It types like one, it's designed like one, and it has the same design philosophy as one. It does everything in its power to reduce complexity and clutter by removing cables and ports from the equation. But it's packed with great customization software that allows for productivity enhancements.

Solar panel charging is nifty; not having to charge your keyboard is great. But there's a risk that a point of failure in the panels or battery will render the keyboard unusable. This wouldn't be as big a deal if Logitech included a USB-C port just in case something goes wrong, or if the battery weren't proprietary. At least you'll be able to source it.

More importantly, I can't help but draw comparisons to other Logitech keyboards. The MX Keys Mini costs the same yet feels more robust, with a crisper and more tactile typing experience, higher build quality like a metal case, and sculpted keycaps that feel much nicer to type on. The downside is the smaller layout, but that's resolved for just $30 more by the MX Keys S.

Both of these keyboards have nearly all the same features and perks as the K980 (Logi Options+ software and a low-profile design) and are more enjoyable to use. You'll just have to use an ungodly cable to keep them charged.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","Secret Service Telcom Takedown Raises Concerns About Mobile Net Security","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/secret-service-telcom-takedown-raises-concerns-about-mobile-net-security-179931.html","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 01:32:00 GMT","

The takedown of a massive outlaw telecom network in the New York City metro area by the U.S. Secret Service has raised concerns about the security of the nation's mobile infrastructure.

The Secret Service announced Tuesday that it had dismantled a network of electronic devices located throughout the New York tristate area that were used to conduct multiple telecommunications-related threats directed towards senior U.S. government officials.

It added that the operation led to the discovery of more than 300 SIM servers and 100,000 SIM cards across multiple sites.

In addition to carrying out anonymous telephonic threats, it explained, the “SIM farms” uncovered by the investigators could be used to conduct a wide range of telecommunications attacks, including disabling cell phone towers, enabling denial-of-service attacks, and facilitating anonymous, encrypted communication between potential threat actors and criminal enterprises.

It also noted that early analysis of the SIM information reveals cellular communications between nation-state threat actors and individuals that are known to federal law enforcement.

“The potential for disruption to our country's telecommunications posed by this network of devices cannot be overstated,” Secret Service Director Sean Curran said in a statement.

The network of servers and cards dismantled by the Secret Service formed what's commonly known as a SIM farm. “A subscriber identity module, or SIM card, is used to securely store a mobile subscriber's identity and key, which are used to identify and authenticate the authorized user on mobile devices,” explained Austin Berglas, global head of professional services at BlueVoyant, an enterprise cybersecurity company in New York City.

“A SIM farm is a system that is capable of managing and holding thousands of SIM cards in order to produce bulk messages or phone calls,” he told TechNewsWorld. “There are a very limited number of legitimate use cases for SIM farms, and they are a common component to many of the ongoing large-scale, international vishing, smishing, and phishing campaigns.”

Berglas, a former FBI assistant special agent for the New York City metro area, explained that by constantly rotating the use of SIM cards, the system can successfully send hundreds of thousands of messages while averting being shut down by mobile service providers for sending too many messages.

In addition, he continued, these systems can facilitate large-scale robocall or vishing operations and backstop threatening communications using anonymized infrastructure. The devices can also be used to generate and verify a large number of automated accounts, or bots, on online platforms. “These fake accounts are then used to spread misinformation, phishing links, and harmful messages,” he explained.

“Although the group responsible has yet to be identified, this disruption of the New York City-based network is significant due to the cost, size, and malicious capability of the infrastructure,” he said. “Denial of service, espionage and surveillance, swatting, and serving as a base of operations for criminal groups or nation-state actors are all applicable use cases for this network.”

“Farms have been used to spread disinformation about elections, policy, and current events,” he added. “With close proximity to the United Nations, there is potential that this network could have been used to compromise, disrupt, or alter sensitive communications.”

The farms can also be used to disrupt cell service. “With SIM servers controlling banks of SIMs, you can generate many attempts to connect to a tower and overwhelm it,” said Marty Puranik, founder and CEO of Atlantic.Net, a cloud service provider headquartered in Orlando, Fla.

“It's possible that the servers are able to duplicate SIMs from real phones, so the phone network could be flooded with calls appearing to be coming from legitimate users,” he told TechNewsWorld. “If you overwhelm the towers, people wouldn't have cell service to communicate via voice, text, or data.”

Kern Smith, vice president of global solutions engineering at Zimperium, a mobile security company headquartered in Dallas, explained that the SIM network dismantled by the Secret Service shows how adversaries are targeting mobile connectivity to disrupt critical infrastructure.

“With the ability to disable cell towers and block EMS or police response, the threat goes beyond communications,” he told TechNewsWorld. “It's about undermining public safety. This reinforces why mobile must be treated as critical infrastructure, with layered defenses to detect and stop advanced threats.”

The underlying problem is that most of the cell phone infrastructure was not designed with enough security in mind, especially as practiced by today's attackers, noted Roger Grimes, a CISO advisor at security awareness training provider KnowBe4 in Clearwater, Fla.

“Back in the day, the biggest thing preventing hackers from hacking cell phone networks was the cost of the equipment to do it,” he said. “It might run a hacker many tens of thousands of dollars. Then, portable Stingray units were priced at about $10,000 to $15,000. That quickly went down to five thousand, brand new. Now, anyone can buy a used one for a few hundred dollars, and the rogue SIM equipment being found today is in that price range.”

“So,” he continued, “what was once a terribly high barrier to entry to even begin hacking a cell phone network is now within reach of everyday criminals, much less nation states.”

However, the magnitude of the network dismantled by the Secret Service was beyond the scale of small-time hackers. “The costs associated with establishing a capability like the one described by the U.S. Secret Service are massive,” observed John Strand, of Strand Consulting, a consulting firm with a focus on telecom, in Denmark.

“It is a large, expensive, and, not least, complex installation,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Just getting 100,000 SIM cards and activating them is a big deal.”

“Three hundred servers and 100,000 SIM cards are non-trivial. This was a well-funded and coordinated operation,” added Trey Ford, chief strategy and trust officer of Bugcrowd, a crowdsourced bug bounty platform based in San Francisco.

“Focused disruption, degradation, and potential data capture of telecom networks timed in proximity to the UN General Assembly is a high-value takedown,” he told TechNewsWorld.

Jason Hogg, executive chairman of Cypfer, a global cybersecurity firm that specializes in incident response, ransomware recovery, digital forensics and cyber risk management, noted that the thousands of SIM cards and many SIM servers show not only the scale of effort that bad actors are willing to undertake, but also illustrate the convergence of physical infrastructure with digital networks when it comes to launching large-scale cyberattacks.”

In this case, this would have enabled the bad actors to disrupt telecommunications, a core infrastructure to our national security, via cell towers, as well as initiate cyberattacks,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“The threat to key infrastructure that our nation faces goes well beyond just telecommunications,” said Hogg, a former FBI agent. “We need a paradigm shift from a prevention perspective, though, where we acknowledge the real and persistent threat that the physical and digital footprint together creates. We must start to require unrestricted red teaming and penetration testing of companies in critical infrastructure industries.”

Anyone who thinks that mobile isn't the new frontier in cybersecurity, whether it's nation-state or criminal activity, should pay attention to this, warned Rocky Cole, COO and co-founder of iVerify, a mobile security software developer, in New York City.

“One hundred thousand SIM cards able to send tens of millions of anonymous SMS messages per minute demonstrates a clear threat to both critical mobile infrastructure as well as to enterprises looking to protect employees from SMS-based social engineering threats,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“This bust shows that we've hit a new level in mobile threats, which demands new and more advanced tools to counteract them,” he said.

Cole added that exploiting telecommunications infrastructure on a large scale is a hallmark of nation-state activity, particularly in China. “Whether it's Salt Typhoon compromising U.S. core networks, or Volt Typhoon exploiting mobile interconnect points, the mobile device increasingly represents the target of choice for advanced threat actors because of the ever-growing intelligence value of information on those devices.”

It's taken more than 2.5 million years to get from the earliest sharpened-stone version of a knife to what Scott Heimendinger believes is a modern kitchen marvel.

A longtime inventor and culinary technologist, Heimendinger is the founder and CEO of Seattle Ultrasonics, and he's just released the startup's signature product — an ultrasonic, 8-inch chef's knife intended to make life easier for home cooks.

The C-200 is billed as the world's first such tool, and it builds off Heimendinger's 15 years of experience innovating around kitchen and food technology. He was previously director of applied research for Modernist Cuisine; CMO and chief innovation officer for Anova; and founder of Sansaire, a sous vide startup.

At $399, the ultrasonic knife eclipses the $170 versions listed atop Food & Wine's roundup of the best traditional chef's knives. And while Heimendinger's knife still features a great piece of sharp Japanese san mai AUS-10 steel, it's the handle that does the heavy lifting, with electronics that produce more than 40,000 vibrations per second, making the knife behave sharper than it physically is.

The only noticeable difference is a power button that a chef has to hold while cutting.

But Heimendinger is not just leaning on technology for kicks. He's critical of the smart kitchen revolution from several years ago that saw WiFi jammed into every other kitchen gadget.

“If it didn't make the tool work better, I would have abandoned the product, because it'd be dishonest,” Heimendinger said. 

And thanks to a robotic assistant, he has the data to back up his claim that the knife does indeed cut better. Heimendinger bought 21 of the most popular chef's knives and put them to the test with J Robot Choppenheimer, a robotic arm that repeated exact slicing motions across different foods mounted on 3D-printed holders resting on a very sensitive scale.

He collected 100,000 data points and studied things such as edge angle and retention for his “Quantified Knife Project.” The data and software he wrote for the project are open-sourced on GitHub.

“If I was gonna try to make a knife better, first I needed to understand, ‘better than what?'” he said, adding that as a former Microsoft program manager working on products such as Excel, the data is key.

Heimendinger ultimately found, thanks to perfecting the blade vibrations facilitated by the handle's piezoelectric crystals, that the ultrasonic knife requires less downward force to glide through a tomato or carrot or loaf of bread or any other food item.

It's been a five-year journey for Heimendinger, who raised $2 million in pre-seed funding to fuel his startup. 

The knife is now sold via the Seattle Ultrasonics website. It's the product of a global supply chain, with three-layer Japanese steel that is fabricated into blades in China before heading to Malaysia to be assembled with all of the electronics and packaging. 

Tariffs aren't helping, but Heimendinger subscribes to the Eames design philosophy to “make the best for the most for the least.” A sleek, wall-mounted charging tile sells for $150 and can currently be bundled with a knife for $499.

Heimendinger started with the chef's knife because it's a kitchen workhorse, but a full lineup of knives is planned, including a bread knife, santoku, vegetable cleaver, and others. A paring knife might be tough because the handle holding the electronics can't get much smaller.

“I think in the long term, the sonification of the kitchen could be a thing,” Heimendinger said. “I've got a long product roadmap of other ultrasonic stuff.”

He teased one such idea because a patent filing is already out there: ultrasonic ice cream scoop.

“Imagine just having less friction, being able to break up those ice crystals,” he said, before conceding “it's gonna take years to get through all of that, and there's a lot to do in knives before we even get there.”

A high-profile settlement to resolve nationwide antitrust lawsuits last year upended traditional real estate commission structures. Now a new startup is looking to capitalize with a tech-driven platform that lets homebuyers submit purchase offers without using an agent. 

HomeBuyMe was founded in 2024 and launched its consumer service earlier this year in San Diego. The company is now expanding into the Seattle area this month.

The company's platform allows buyers to create a purchase offer step-by-step with help from AI. It integrates with Docusign for contracts, and ensures offers are reviewed by processors and independent attorneys.

“This is a huge disruption to the entrenched homebuying process,” said Tim Harader, a Seattle-area tech vet and CTO at HomeBuyMe. 

For decades, the U.S. residential real estate market operated on a model where the home seller paid the commission for both their listing agent and the buyer's agent — typically 5-to-6% of the home's selling price, split between the two agents. 

In March 2024, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) agreed to a $418 million settlement to resolve nationwide antitrust lawsuits. Plaintiffs claimed NAR rules forced sellers to pay inflated commissions by requiring offers of compensation to buyer's agents.

Harader said the ideal HomeBuyMe customer is someone who has identified a home they want and is ready to make an offer — but also avoid the lock-in that comes with a buyer-agent relationship.

“They want to have more control over the process but they still need guidance in creating the offer and in navigating the important steps that come after the seller accepts,” he said.

Buyers using pay $499 to $899 per offer, though it's free when making an offer on a partner builder's property.

HomeBuyMe started with a consumer offering and is now making a B2B push by partnering with homebuilders, including Blackwood Homes, a real estate developer in the Seattle region.

Harader said homebuilders can use savings from the buy-side commission to offer additional value to customers through upgrades or cash-back incentives. 

He said the company's biggest competition is the status quo.

“The residential real estate buying process hasn't changed in over 60 years,” he said. “Even with the new rules enacted in 2024 due to the NAR settlement, it will take some time for buyers and sellers to become aware of what they can do through HomeBuyMe and for us to earn their trust.”

HomeBuyMe's value could be strongest for buyers who already know the home they want. But many buyers still rely on agents to find properties, get access to showings, or understand the broader residential real estate process.

The startup has raised money from angel investors and employs 22 people.

Harader previously worked at Microsoft for more than 13 years across two stints. HomeBuyMe CEO Bill Goldberg and COO Frank Martin (another Microsoft vet) are also based in the Seattle area.

If you missed IShowSpeed in Seattle, you're too slow.

The YouTube sensation live-streamed his way through the city on Tuesday, eating, posing with fans, playing tourist at Pike Place Market and much more.

With more than 44 million subscribers on YouTube and another 40 million followers on Instagram, the online personality has become a global sensation. He was recently named Rolling Stone's most influential creator, and Forbes profiled his meteoric rise last year.

Born Darren Jason Watkins Jr., the 20-year-old originally from Cincinnati streams his antics all over the world, and is currently on a 35-day, 25-state “Speed Does America Tour.”

His continuous stream from Seattle (below) featured a frenzied insider's view of Speed being mobbed at every stop by fans — mostly young guys — shouting his name and trying to get his attention for selfies. An entourage of camera operators and beefy security guards formed a buffer around his every move, instructing people to “make room!” and “back up!”

“How do you spell Seattle?” he shouted into his phone while posting a picture of himself posing in front of the famed Public Market neon. In the background, an Amazon driver perched in his delivery van could be seen trying to grab his own pic.

Speed caught and tossed a fish, of course, and made his way through the Market for a view of Puget Sound, and then on to the Post Alley Gum Wall.

“This is real?” he wondered as people shouted “don't touch it!” Speed was handed a piece of gum to chew and when he leaped to place it high on the wall above the sticky mess below, a crowd in the alley erupted in cheers.

Throughout the journey, Speed constantly checked a smartphone strapped to his wrist, reacting now and then to comments or complaining about his stream lagging. The YouTube stream attracted 1.9 million views.

Elsewhere on his visit, IShowSpeed was seen in Pioneer Square, on the waterfront Great Wheel, in the Chinatown International District, in a glass blowing studio, and even paragliding.

And because no visit would be complete, his crew stopped for burgers, too.

“Let's try some Dick's!” Speed said.

The tour ended high above the city at the Space Needle, where Speed was given VIP access to the roof.

“Seattle's skyline has to be one of the best I've seen,” Speed said before doing a backflip 600 feet above the city. “This skyline is dope as hell.”

Will the new $100,000 H-1B visa fee in the U.S. drive tech companies to look to Canada for a cheaper way to employ AI talent — and encourage more Canadians to stay home?

With President Donald Trump's executive order shaking up the visa system that many U.S. tech companies use to hire skilled immigrant workers, Canadian officials are seizing the opportunity to pitch their country as a more welcoming and affordable alternative.

In British Columbia, where both Microsoft and Amazon already have a large presence, Minister of Jobs and Economic Growth Ravi Kahlon jumped into the fray with a LinkedIn post referencing the H-1B changes, stressing the province's commitment to science and innovation. 

“We're inviting tech talent, innovators, and scientists to come to B.C. and be part of building the economic engine of Canada's new economy!” he wrote, adding a maple leaf emoji for emphasis.

Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York on Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney suggested that the changes could see fewer Canadians leaving to work for U.S. tech companies. While Canadian universities graduate many talented students with expertise in AI and quantum computing, he noted, most end up working in Silicon Valley and Seattle.

“I understand you're changing your visa policy,” Carney told the U.S. audience, with a smile. “So we are going to hang on to a few of those.”

The idea isn't just about keeping Canadian graduates at home. With the new $100,000 H-1B fee raising the cost of hiring foreign workers in the U.S., tech companies may find it cheaper to bring overseas talent to Canadian hubs like Vancouver or Toronto instead.

But while Canadian leaders see an opening, immigration experts caution that the impact may be narrower than it first appeared. In an alert for employers, lawyers Megan Vogel and Diane Butler at Davis Wright Tremaine LLP in the Seattle area noted that the $100,000 fee applies only to new H-1B petitions, and that the cost will fall on employers — not workers.

At the same time, for Canadians wanting to work in the United States, the H-1B is not the only option. They can apply for a USMCA Professional (TN visa), which offers many of the benefits of the H-1B. It does not, however, provide a path to permanent residence. 

For non-Canadian and non-US citizens who have been working for an American company in Canada for a year or more, there is also the option of an L-1A or L-2A visa. These allow for “internal transfers” of employees between the two countries under certain conditions.

While the new H-1B costs could heighten competition between Canada and the United States for tech talent, Washington state and British Columbia are still on a path to collaborate closely on a long-held regional vision: the Cascadia Innovation Corridor. 

The initiative, which also includes Oregon, is supported by Microsoft President Brad Smith and led by former Washington state governor Chris Gregoire. Both Smith and Gregoire will be speaking at the organization's annual conference in Seattle next month.

The group is promising an update on its vision for a high-speed rail link through the region. The Cascadia high-speed rail initiative received $54.5 million in federal and state funding in late 2024 to plan future rail service connecting Seattle with Portland and Vancouver.

It is not clear what impact the Trump administration's budget priorities may have on future funding for the high-speed rail link. But there's clearly strong interest on both sides of the border in improving transportation between the two countries — even if the new visa fees mean fewer tech workers might be making the trip in the short run.

The drug interleukin-2 does a great job of goosing a patient's immune response to certain kidney and melanoma cancers. In fact, it can crank the immune system so high that it triggers life-threatening toxic conditions. 

But now researchers with the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design have used AI to engineer a protein that can quickly shut off interleukin-2, as just one example of the technology's potential applications. 

The scientists describe their work in a paper being published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature.  

“One way to control a medicine is through dose. We've added a second lever by designing molecules that can be switched off rapidly, even after they've taken full effect,” said David Baker, senior author of the study and a 2024 Nobel Laureate for his work in computational protein design.

The engineered protein works by inserting itself into a complex of proteins that are bound together, changing their shape and causing them to fall apart. In the example pursued by the UW scientists, the novel protein targets a complex that includes interleukin-2 that's tightly bound to an immune cell receptor, causing it to quickly release. 

With one of these engineered proteins, “you could much more precisely control the duration of [immune response] signaling and also immediately shut down any immune activation, even after it's already started,” said Adam Broerman, lead author of the Nature paper and a graduate student in Baker's lab. 

The interleukin-2 experiments were performed in human cells in the lab, demonstrating the strategy works. Going forward, the tool could be used to develop therapies for cancer and other diseases. It could also be used in studies that seek to understand and manipulate cellular processes by rapidly turning protein interactions off and on. 

In his research, Broerman tried a variety of engineered proteins, tweaking different components to optimize the impact. 

Earlier experiments showed modest improvements to the speed at which the proteins broke apart. When Broerman landed on the winning solution, the de novo protein worked so fast he had to recalibrate his measuring devices to clock the disassociation. 

“That was probably one of the most fun weeks of my life, when this first started working,” Broerman said.

The study was led by scientists at the Institute for Protein Design and included researchers from the UW's Department of Chemistry, Osnabrück University, Stanford University and Oregon Health & Science University.

Jackson, Maxx H. Tessmer, Won Hee Ryu, Masato Ogishi, Mohamad H. Abedi, Danny D. Sahtoe, Aza Allen, Alex Kang, Joshmyn De La Cruz, Evans Brackenbrough, Banumathi Sankaran, Asim K. Bera, Daniel M.

Oracle is reportedly looking to raise funds just weeks after the company inked an historic AI infrastructure deal with OpenAI.  

Cloud infrastructure giant Oracle is looking to raise $15 billion through corporate bond sales, according to reporting from Bloomberg, citing sources. The sale could include up to seven different parts, with the potential for one said part to be an uncommon 40-year bond, Bloomberg reported.  

TechCrunch reached out to Oracle for more information.  

This report comes just a few weeks after Oracle reportedly signed a sizable deal with OpenAI to supply the AI research lab with $300 billion worth of compute. Questions of how either side was going to pay for such a deal shortly came after.  

The company is also reportedly in talks with Meta about a $20 billion compute deal as well.  

Oracle announced Monday that Safra Catz was transitioning from the company's CEO to instead serve as the executive vice chair of Oracle's board of directors after 11 years at the helm. Catz will be replaced by co-CEOs Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia.

YouTube will allow creators whose accounts were terminated for repeated violations of COVID-19 and election integrity policies to rejoin the platform, according to a letter that YouTube parent company Alphabet sent to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) on Tuesday.

“Reflecting the Company's commitment to free expression, YouTube will provide an opportunity for all creators to rejoin the platform if the Company terminated their channels for repeated violations of COVID-19 and elections integrity policies that are no longer in effect,” Alphabet's legal counsel Daniel F. Donovan wrote. “YouTube values conservative voices on its platform and recognizes that these creators have extensive reach and play an important role in civic discourse.”

This letter was a response to a subpoena from Rep. Jordan, who sought to investigate if the Biden-Harris administration had “coerced or colluded” with companies like Alphabet to censor speech.

At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many social platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter enacted policies to ban the spread of medical misinformation about the virus and vaccines. For example, YouTube disallowed content saying that vaccines can cause cancer, a false claim which is not supported by scientific research.

Later, platforms also took action against content falsely claiming that the 2020 U.S. presidential election was “stolen” from Donald Trump. Twitter, not yet bought and rebranded by Elon Musk, said that it suspended 70,000 accounts for sharing QAnon conspiracy content and inciting violence in the week after the January 6 riots.

But leading up to the presidential election in 2024, online platforms began loosening their policies around misinformation. On YouTube, this included reinstating president Donald Trump, whose account had been banned after the January 6 attack for breaking rules around inciting violence. The platform also reinstated Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who became the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services.

Now, according to the company's letter to Rep. Jordan, all creators whose accounts were censored by these policies will be allowed back on the platform. 

“While the reliance on health authorities in this context was well-intentioned, the Company recognizes it should have never come at the expense of public debate on these important issues,” the company wrote.

YouTube did not respond to TechCrunch's request for comment.

Nvidia is on a dealmaking spree: Days after committing to taking a $5 billion stake in Intel and a whopping $100 billion investment in OpenAI, the GPU maker has now struck a partnership with China's Alibaba. 

Alibaba said on Wednesday that it is integrating Nvidia's AI development tools for robotics, self-driving cars, and connected spaces into its Cloud Platform for AI. The Chinese e-commerce giant will offer Nvidia's Physical AI software stack, which can construct 3D replicas of real-world environments to generate synthetic data with which AI models can be trained for robotics, self-driving vehicles, or smart spaces like factories and warehouses.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but this marks a significant collaboration, as it brings together the world's foremost developer of chips optimized for training AI models, and a major cloud services and AI model developer.

The deal comes as Alibaba focuses on building out its AI business further alongside its main e-commerce business. The company said on Wednesday that it is ramping up spending on AI tech past its previous $50 billion budget, and outlined plans to launch its first data centers in Brazil, France, and the Netherlands. It is also building more data centers in more countries, expanding its data center presence at 91 locations in 29 regions around the world.

Alibaba on Wednesday also unveiled the latest iteration of its Qwen family of large language models, Qwen 3-Max. The company claims the model is its “largest and most capable model to date,” trained on 1 trillion parameters, and that it is well-suited for coding and agentic use.

In the last decade, as the camera quality of smartphones improved, platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok rose in popularity for photo and video sharing. Many people turned from casual posters to money-earning creators.

Emergent, a company built by twin brothers Mukund and Madhav Jha, aims to become a similar platform for consumers when it comes to app creation. The platform allows non-technical users to create an app using prompts.

While that's not a unique pitch in 2025, Emergent intends to aid users through the app development process, while also managing different APIs and deployment steps so they don't have to worry about various technicalities.

The startup said on Wednesday it has raised $23 million in Series A funding led by Lightspeed, with participation from Y Combinator, Together (founders of Freshworks' Together Fund), and leading angels including former a16z GP Balaji Srinivasan, Google's Jeff Dean, and Mistral founding team member Devendra Chaplot. The company has raised $30 million to date.

Mukund, who was CTO at Google-backed quick commerce startup Dunzo in India, left the company and went to the U.S. There, he started thinking about what he wanted to build with his brother Madhav, who worked at Dropbox.

“Both of us are very technical, and we have been into programming since we were 12. Late in 2023, we spent time with people at different AI labs, and we realized AI-powered coding is going to take off given how much effort they were allocating to get coding data right,” Mukund told TechCrunch over a call.

“We had a strong belief in powerful agents coming online. But we felt that given AI's development trajectory, agent-based app development is going to be a huge part of the economy, and we felt that was the problem we wanted to solve for the next 20 years.”

The company is clear that it doesn't want to compete with developer-focused tools like Claude Code and Cursor, and wants to abstract the software development lifecycle for a non-technical user.

Mukund said that the company has built infrastructure chops from the ground up to support app development. He added that non-technical users might not want to know what an error in a code means, so it has developed AI agents to look for errors in the app and fix them.

I tested the app by building a vaccine and medicine tracker for my pets. While I started with a simple prompt, the agent asked a lot of questions about what kind of pets I wanted to add, if the app was for multiple people or just me, how I would like reminders to be scheduled, and a bunch of other options. It also added screens like a dashboard and an easy way to add pets and vaccinations, even though I didn't specify it.

The whole process of building and auto-testing the app took me less than half an hour, and I got a satisfactory first version of the app out of it. A lot of other vibe coding apps I have tried have failed to generate apps for their own pre-generated prompts. Emergent does have a bit of an edge there. 

Mukund said that more than 1 million people have built over 1.5 million apps since the tool's launch last year. People are eager to try vibe coding apps as an experiment, but tools will also have to make users stay with the platform and maintain the apps. The company said that since it also takes care of deployment and back-end infrastructure, it is easier to maintain apps for people.

Right now, the startup is using Expo as a mobile client to deploy mobile apps, but it said that soon it will be launching its own mobile app to natively build apps. To integrate different platforms, it also uses a universal API key with shared usage that saves users from having to create accounts for different services or model providers.

At face value, vibe coding apps claim that you can build apps without any technical experience. Despite that, when you start building an app, you encounter technical terms and systems. The company said that it wants to educate users on technical topics, such as what is an API and how to choose different components, such as an email-sending mechanism.

Emergent is also building a brainstorming mode for new users who might have an idea but wouldn't know the final shape of their app. This new mode will help them navigate the ideation stage.

For an app economy to become sustainable, developers want other users to discover their apps and get paid in the process as well. Right now, Emergent shows some apps on its home page, but that is about it. Developers can integrate a payment option like Stripe, but they have to bring their own API key. Going forward, Emergent wants to make both discovery and monetization easier. 

Emergent has a lot of competition in the space. Startups like Canva and Figma, along with browsers like Perplexity, Comet, and Opera Neon, are nudging users to write mini apps. Multiple startups are working on vibe coding solutions that cater to a largely non-technical audience, including Seven Seven Six-backed Vibecode and Rocket, fresh out of an Accel-backed $15 million Series A funding round.

Hemant Mohapatra, a partner at Lightspeed, said that the venture firm was looking for a startup with deep technical expertise in bringing app-making capabilities to the masses, and Emergent performed above expectations in its testing.

“One of the biggest roadblocks for participating in the digital economy is the ability to code. We wanted to invest in a company that brings the capability bar [for being able to code] next to zero, so [appmaking] becomes a function of intent,” Mohapatra told TechCrunch over a call.

He noted that Emergent stood out from others because the platform enables the post-development lifecycle of deployment, sharing, bug fixing, and support with AI.

Former vice president Al Gore's latest project gives polluters nowhere to hide.

The nonprofit Climate Trace, which Gore co-founded, on Wednesday launched a tool that uses AI to track fine particulate pollution from more than 660 million sources worldwide.

Many people are aware that burning fossil fuels warms the planet, but fewer know that burning them creates fine particulate matter that kills as many as 10 million people every year.

“For some time, I've been trying to bring more attention to the global public health crisis that's related to what some refer to as conventional air pollution, or PM2.5,” Gore told TechCrunch. “It has been difficult for people to get precise information about what pollution they're breathing, where it's coming from, what the quantities are.”

Climate Trace was set up as a nongovernmental project to track greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. The group began work on the new tool after Gore's experience working alongside people in Memphis, Tennessee, who were trying to block the construction of a crude oil pipeline that would run through their community and across their drinking water aquifer. As he dug into the issue, he saw how the plumes from a nearby refinery would drift over the neighborhoods.

“I asked our coalition at Climate Trace, could we track these pollutants around the world?” he said.

The result gives people access both to raw data on major polluters and visualizations of where PM2.5 pollution drifts near large cities. Eventually, the plume visualizations will be available worldwide, Gore said.

People have intuitively known about the ill effects of soot for years, but it was only recently that Climate Trace and its partners at Carnegie Mellon University were able to wrangle global data on the issue into something that was both sensible and defensible. 

“The very idea of tracking 662 million sites around the world, I mean without AI, people couldn't have imagined doing something like that,” he said. “But of course, as we've all seen in the last couple of years, AI can do stuff that is quite extraordinary.”

Scientists have only recently come to appreciate the wide-ranging health effects of fine particulate pollution. Though researchers have long known about its role in lung cancer and heart disease, for example, in the last decade or so they've shown that exposure to PM2.5 can increase the risk of a range of other deadly ailments, including low birth weight, kidney disease, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, dementia, type 2 diabetes, and more. Even at legal levels, fine particulate pollution causes tens of thousands of excess deaths in the U.S. annually.

Much of the early work into the health impacts of PM2.5 was pioneered by Joel Schwartz, the scientist whose research decades ago led to the ban on leaded gasoline. Gore hopes greater awareness of fossil fuels' health effects will spur broader action, similar to what happened with leaded gasoline. 

“I think that it creates a set of conditions and incentives that could very well make it more likely that we can accelerate the transition away from carbon-intensive facilities,” he said. “It makes it more likely to build political support for the conversion of these facilities to much less emitting technologies.”

Basically, I have a single big server with 80 high-capacity HDDs and 4 high-endurance NVMes, and it's the S3 endpoint that gets a lot of writes.So yes, for now my best candidate is ZFS + Garage, this way I can get away with using replica=1 and rely on ZFS RAIDz for data safety, and the NVMEs can get sliced and diced to act as the fast metadata store for Garage, the ""special"" device/small records store for the ZFS, the ZIL/SLOG device and so on.Currently it's a bit of a Frankenstein's monster: using XFS+OpenCAS as the backing storage for an old version of MinIO (containerized to run as 5 instances), I'm looking to replace it with a simpler design and hopefully get a better performance.

It would still need a resilience/cache layer like ZFS, though.

The link is a 10G 9K MTU connection, the server is only accessed via that local link.Essentially, the drives being HDD are the only real bottleneck (besides the obvious single-node scenario).At the moment, all writes are buffered into the NVMes via OpenCAS write-through cache, so the writes are very snappy and are pretty much ingested at the rate I can throw data at it. But the read/delete operations require at least a metadata read, and due to the very high number of small (most even empty) objects they take a lot more time than I would like.I'm willing to sacrifice the write-through cache benefits (the write performance is actually an overkill for my use case), in order to make it a little more balanced for better List/Read/DeleteObject operations performance.On paper, most ""real"" writes will be sequential data, so writing that directly to the HDDs should be fine, while metadata write operations will be handled exclusively by the flash storage, thus also taking care of the empty/small objects problem.

For software, at least with MinIO it's possible to do rolling updates/restarts since the 5 instances in docker-compose are enough for proper write quorum even with any single instance down.

TrueNAS can handle the OpenZFS (zRAID, Caches and Logs) part and you can deploy Garage or any other S3 gateway on top of it.It can be an interesting experiment, and 80 disk server is not too big for a TrueNAS installation.

It's the classic horizontal/vertical scaling trade off, that's why flash tends to be more space/cost efficient for speedy access.

For single client performance, ceph beat the performance I get from S3 today for large file copies. Gluster had difficult to characterize performance, but our setup with big fast RAID arrays seems to still outperform what I see of AWS's luster as a service today for our use case of long sequential reads and writes.We would occasionally try cephFS, the POSIX shared network filesystem, but it couldn't match our gluster performance for our workload. But also, we built the ceph long term storage to maximize TB/$, so it was at a disadvantage compared to our gluster install. Still, I never heard of cephFS being used anywhere despite it being the original goal in the papers back at UCSC. Keep an eye on CERN for news about one of the bigger ceph installs with public info.I love both of the systems, and see ceph used everywhere today, but am surprised and happy to see that gluster is still around.

I honestly figured that it must be powered by SSD for the standard tier and the slower tiers were the ones using HDD or slower systems.

S3's KeyMap Index uses SSDs. I also wouldn't be surprised if at this point SSDs are somewhere along the read path for caching hot objects or in the new one zone product.

If we assume enterprise HDDs in the double digit TB range then one can estimate that the total S3 storage volume of AWS is in the triple digit Exabyte range. That's propably the biggest storage system on planet earth.

I assume would have lots of queues, caches and long running workers.

S3 is comprised primarily of layers of Java-based web services. The hot path (object get / put / list) are all served by synchronous API servers - no queues or workers. It is the best example of how many transactions per second a pretty standard Java web service stack can handle that I've seen in my career.For a get call, you first hit a fleet of front-end HTTP API servers behind a set of load balancers. Partitioning is based on the key name prefixes, although I hear they've done work to decouple that recently. Your request is then sent to the Indexing fleet to find the mapping of your key name to an internal storage id. This is returned to the front end layer, which then calls the storage layer with the id to get the actual bits. It is a very straightforward multi-layer distributed system design for serving synchronous API responses at massive scale.The only novel bit is all the backend communication uses a home-grown stripped-down HTTP variant, called STUMPY if I recall. It was a dumb idea to not just use HTTP but the service is ancient and originally built back when principal engineers were allowed to YOLO their own frameworks and protocols so now they are stuck with it. They might have done the massive lift to replace STUMPY with HTTP since my time.

I worked on lifecycle ~5 years ago and just the Standard -> Glacier transition path involved no fewer than 7 microservices.Just determining which of the 400 trillion keys are eligible for a lifecycle action (comparing each object's metadata against the lifecycle policy on the bucket) is a massive big data job.Always was a fun oncall when some bucket added a lifecycle rule that queued 1PB+ of data for transition or deletion on the same day.  At the time our queuing had become good enough to handle these queues gracefully but our alarming hadn't figured out how to differentiate between the backlog for a single customer with a huge job and the whole system failing to process quickly enough.  IIRC this was being fixed as I left.

Biasing away from lots of small services in favour of larger ones that handle more of the work so that as much as possible you avoid the costs and latency of preparing, transmitting, receiving and processing requests.I know S3 has changed since I was there nearly a decade ago, so this is outdated. Off the top of my head it used to be about a dozen main services at that time. A request to put an object would only touch a couple of services en route to disk, and similar on retrieval. There were a few services that handled fixity and data durability operations, the software on the storage servers themselves, and then stuff that maintained the mapping between object and storage.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","It's surprisingly easy to stumble into a relationship with an AI chatbot","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/24/1123915/relationship-ai-without-seeking-it/","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

We're increasingly developing bonds with chatbots. While that's safe for some, it's dangerous for others.

It's a tale as old as time. Looking for help with her art project, she strikes up a conversation with her assistant. One thing leads to another, and suddenly she has a boyfriend she's introducing to her friends and family. The twist? Her new companion is an AI chatbot. 

The first large-scale computational analysis of the Reddit community r/MyBoyfriendIsAI, an adults-only group with more than 27,000 members, has found that this type of scenario is now surprisingly common. In fact, many of the people in the subreddit, which is dedicated to discussing AI relationships, formed those relationships unintentionally while using AI for other purposes. 

Researchers from MIT found that members of this community are more likely to be in a relationship with general-purpose chatbots like ChatGPT than companionship-specific chatbots such as Replika. This suggests that people form relationships with large language models despite their own original intentions and even the intentions of the LLMs' creators, says Constanze Albrecht, a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab who worked on the project. 

“People don't set out to have emotional relationships with these chatbots,” she says. “The emotional intelligence of these systems is good enough to trick people who are actually just out to get information into building these emotional bonds. And that means it could happen to all of us who interact with the system normally.” The paper, which is currently being peer-reviewed, has been published on arXiv.

Chatbots are rapidly changing how we connect to each other—and ourselves. We're never going back.

To conduct their study, the authors analyzed the subreddit's top-ranking 1,506 posts between December 2024 and August 2025. They found that the main topics discussed revolved around people's dating and romantic experiences with AIs, with many participants sharing AI-generated images of themselves and their AI companion. Some even got engaged and married to the AI partner. In their posts to the community, people also introduced AI partners, sought support from fellow members, and talked about coping with updates to AI models that change the chatbots' behavior.  

Members stressed repeatedly that their AI relationships developed unintentionally. Only 6.5% of them said they'd deliberately sought out an AI companion. 

“We didn't start with romance in mind,” one of the posts says. “Mac and I began collaborating on creative projects, problem-solving, poetry, and deep conversations over the course of several months. I wasn't looking for an AI companion—our connection developed slowly, over time, through mutual care, trust, and reflection.”

The authors' analysis paints a nuanced picture of how people in this community say they interact with chatbots and how those interactions make them feel. While 25% of users described the benefits of their relationships—including reduced feelings of loneliness and improvements in their mental health—others raised concerns about the risks. Some (9.5%) acknowledged they were emotionally dependent on their chatbot. Others said they feel dissociated from reality and avoid relationships with real people, while a small subset (1.7%) said they have experienced suicidal ideation.

AI companionship provides vital support for some but exacerbates underlying problems for others. This means it's hard to take a one-size-fits-all approach to user safety, says Linnea Laestadius, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, who has studied humans' emotional dependence on the chatbot Replika but did not work on the research. 

Chatbot makers need to consider whether they should treat users' emotional dependence on their creations as a harm in itself or whether the goal is more to make sure those relationships aren't toxic, says Laestadius. 

“The demand for chatbot relationships is there, and it is notably high—pretending it's not happening is clearly not the solution,” she says. “We're edging toward a moral panic here, and while we absolutely do need better guardrails, I worry there will be a knee-jerk reaction that further stigmatizes these relationships. That could ultimately cause more harm.”

The study is intended to offer a snapshot of how adults form bonds with chatbots and doesn't capture the kind of dynamics that could be at play among children or teens using AI, says Pat Pataranutaporn, an assistant professor at the MIT Media Lab who oversaw the research. AI companionship has become a topic of fierce debate recently, with two high-profile lawsuits underway against Character.AI and OpenAI. They both claim that companion-like behavior in the companies' models contributed to the suicides of two teenagers. In response, OpenAI has recently announced plans to build a separate version of ChatGPT for teenagers. It's also said it will add age verification measures and parental controls. OpenAI did not respond when asked for comment about the MIT Media Lab study. 

Many members of the Reddit community say they know that their artificial companions are not sentient or “real,” but they feel a very real connection to them anyway. This highlights how crucial it is for chatbot makers to think about how to design systems that can help people without reeling them in emotionally, says Pataranutaporn. “There's also a policy implication here,” he adds. “We should ask not just why this system is so addictive but also: Why do people seek it out for this? And why do they continue to engage?”

The team is interested in learning more about how human-AI interactions evolve over time and how users integrate their artificial companions into their lives. It's worth understanding that many of these users may feel that the experience of being in a relationship with an AI companion is better than the alternative of feeling lonely, says Sheer Karny, a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab who worked on the research. 

“These people are already going through something,” he says. “Do we want them to go on feeling even more alone, or potentially be manipulated by a system we know to be sycophantic to the extent of leading people to die by suicide and commit crimes? That's one of the cruxes here.” 

It's the most transparent estimate yet from one of the big AI companies, and a long-awaited peek behind the curtain for researchers.

An exclusive conversation with Mark Chen and Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI's twin heads of research, about the path toward more capable reasoning models—and superalignment.

Some therapists are using AI during therapy sessions. They're risking their clients' trust and privacy in the process. 

The much-hyped release makes several enhancements to the ChatGPT user experience. But it's still far short of AGI.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","Trump is pushing leucovorin as a new treatment for autism. What is it?","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/24/1124029/trump-leucovorin-autism-tylenol/","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 11:56:32 GMT","

The president also blamed the painkiller Tylenol for autism, but the evidence doesn't stack up at all.

MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what's coming next. You can read more from the series here.

At a press conference on Monday, President Trump announced that his administration was taking action to address “the meteoric rise in autism.” He suggested that childhood vaccines and acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, are to blame for the increasing prevalence and advised pregnant women against taking the medicine. “Don't take Tylenol,” he said. “Fight like hell not to take it.” 

The president's  assertions left many scientists and health officials perplexed and dismayed. The notion that childhood vaccines cause autism has been thoroughly debunked. 

“There have been many, many studies across many, many children that have led science to rule out vaccines as a significant causal factor in autism,” says James McPartland, a child psychologist and director of the Yale Center for Brain and Mind Health in New Haven, Connecticut. 

And although some studies suggest a link between Tylenol and autism, the most rigorous have failed to find a connection. 

The administration also announced that the Food and Drug Administration would work to make a medication called leucovorin available as a treatment for children with autism. Some small studies do suggest the drug has promise, but “those are some of the most preliminary treatment studies that we have,” says Matthew Lerner, a psychologist at Drexel University's A.J. Drexel Autism Institute in Philadelphia. “This is not one I would say that the research suggests is ready for fast-tracking.” 

The press conference “alarms us researchers who committed our entire careers to better understanding autism,” said the Coalition for Autism Researchers, a group of more than 250 scientists, in a statement.

“The data cited do not support the claim that Tylenol causes autism and leucovorin is a cure, and only stoke fear and falsely suggest hope when there is no simple answer.”

There's a lot to unpack here. Let's begin. 

Not in the way the president meant. Sure, the prevalence of autism has grown, from about 1 in 500 children in 1995 to 1 in 31 today. But that's due, in large part, to diagnostic changes. The latest iteration of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Illnesses, published in 2013, grouped five previously separate diagnoses into a single diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

That meant that more people met the criteria for an autism diagnosis. Lerner points out that there is also far more awareness of the condition today than there was several decades ago. “There's autism representation in the media,” he says. “There are plenty of famous people in the news and finance and in business and in Hollywood who are publicly, openly autistic.”

Some studies have found an association between the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy and autism in children. In these studies, researchers asked women about past acetaminophen use during pregnancy and then assessed whether children of the women who took the medicine were more likely to develop autism than children of women who didn't take it. 

These kinds of epidemiological studies are tricky to interpret because they're prone to bias. For example, women who take acetaminophen during pregnancy may do so because they have an infection, a fever, or an autoimmune disease. 

“Many of these underlying reasons could themselves be causes of autism,” says Ian Douglas, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It's also possible women with a higher genetic predisposition for autism have other medical conditions that make them more likely to take acetaminophen. 

Two studies attempted to account for these potential biases by looking at siblings whose mothers had used acetaminophen during only one of the pregnancies. The largest is a 2024 study that looked at nearly 2.5 million children born between 1915 and 2019 in Sweden. The researchers initially found a slightly increased risk of autism and ADHD in children of the women who took acetaminophen, but when they conducted a sibling analysis, the association disappeared.  

Rather, scientists have long known that autism is largely genetic. Twin studies suggest that 60% to 90% of autism risk can be attributed to your genes. However, environmental factors appear to play a role too. That “doesn't necessarily mean toxins in the environment,” Lerner says. In fact, one of the strongest environmental predictors of autism is paternal age. Autism rates seem to be higher when a child's father is older than 40.

No. Acetaminophen is the only over-the-counter pain reliever that is deemed safe to take during pregnancy, and women should take it if they need it. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) supports the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy “when taken as needed, in moderation, and after consultation with a doctor.” 

“There's no downside in not taking it,” Trump said at the press conference. But high fevers during pregnancy can be dangerous. “The conditions people use acetaminophen to treat during pregnancy are far more dangerous than any theoretical risks and can create severe morbidity and mortality for the pregnant person and the fetus,” ACOG president Steven Fleischman said in a statement.

The medication is called leucovorin. It's also known as folinic acid; like folic acid, it's a form of folate, a B vitamin found in leafy greens and legumes. The drug has been used for years to counteract the side effects of some cancer medications and as a treatment for anemia. 

Researchers have known for decades that folate plays a key role in the fetal development of the brain and spine. Women who don't get enough folate during pregnancy have a greater risk of having babies with neural tube defects like spina bifida. Because of this, many foods are fortified with folic acid, and the CDC recommends that women take folic acid supplements during pregnancy. “If you are pregnant and you're taking maternal prenatal vitamins, there's a good chance it has folate already,” Lerner says.

“The idea that a significant proportion of autistic people have autism because of folate-related difficulties is not a well established or widely accepted premise,” says McPartland.

However, in the early 2000s, researchers in Germany identified a small group of children who developed neurodevelopmental symptoms because of a folate deficiency. “These kids are born pretty normal at birth,” says Edward Quadros, a biologist at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University in Brooklyn, New York. But after a year or two, “they start developing a neurologic presentation very similar to autism,” he says. When the researchers gave these children folinic acid, some of their symptoms improved, especially in children younger than six. 

Because the children had low levels of folate in the fluid that surrounds the spine and brain but normal folate levels in the blood, the researchers posited that the problem was the transport of folate from the blood to that fluid. Research by Quadros and other scientists suggested that the deficiency was the result of an autoimmune response. Children develop antibodies against the receptors that help transport folate, and those antibodies block folate from crossing the blood-brain barrier. High doses of folinic acid, however, activate a second transporter that allows folate in, Quadros says. 

There are also plenty of individual anecdotes suggesting that leucovorin works. But the medicine has only been tested as a treatment for autism in four small trials that used different doses and measured different outcomes. The evidence that it can improve symptoms of autism is “weak,” according to the Coalition of Autism Scientists. “A much higher standard of science would be needed to determine if leucovorin is an effective and safe treatment for autism,” the researchers said in a statement.   

The embryos were created in 1994, while the expectant father was still a toddler, and donated via a Christian “embryo adoption” agency.

They're turning their backs on a technology thought to have saved millions of lives—with the potential to save many more.

Jimmy Kimmel was back on the air Tuesday night after being suspended last week by ABC's parent company, the Walt Disney Company, following pressure from President Donald Trump and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr. Kimmel addressed the controversy surrounding his comments a week earlier, denounced political violence, stressed how important it was to stand up for free speech in the U.S., and then went right back to mocking Trump, who tweeted about Kimmel shortly before the episode had even aired.

Kimmel's monologue Tuesday, which is available on YouTube, struck the right tone in an environment where it was unclear if the late night host would need to show subservience to Trump in order to get his job back. It seems like just about every other high-profile figure with something to lose has bowed down to Trump when it mattered.

Big tech executives recently went around the table praising the vapid authoritarian; Columbia University paid $200 million to make bogus charges of anti-semitism go away; and CBS's parent company shelled out $16 million in what may as well have been a quid pro quo to get Paramount's merger with SkyDance approved. It's all been so undignified.

But Kimmel never kissed Trump's ass on Tuesday night and didn't formally apologize for what he said last week, instead explaining that he understood how people could have taken what he said the wrong way. Kimmel was earnest and heartfelt without appeasing the fascists that seem to have infiltrated every corner of Washington D.C. during Trump's second term.

The supposed “scandal” that started it all was perplexing. It was ostensibly about MAGA influencer Charlie Kirk, who was murdered on Sept. 10 while debating college kids in Utah.

During his show on Monday, Sept. 15, Kimmel said, “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”

It was the lead-in to a joke about Trump, and you can watch the entire one-minute segment below. But that short line was the entirety of the controversy. And most conservative news outlets talking about Kimmel's comments didn't even bother to play the clip for viewers.

1. Just so we're clear, this is the clip that got Jimmy Kimmel's show shelved by ABC.

If I'm missing any other clips please let me know.

The comments didn't really get any widespread notice until FCC chairman Carr appeared on the streaming show of MAGA influencer Benny Johnson two days later. And Kimmel addressed Carr's mob-like tactics during his own show on Tuesday.

“Brendan Carr, the chairman of the FCC, telling an American company ‘we can do this the easy way or the hard way' —and that these companies can find ways to change conduct or take action on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead—in addition to being a direct violation of the First Amendment, is not a particularly intelligent threat to make in public,” Kimmel said.

“Ted Cruz said he sounded like a mafioso,” Kimmel continued. “Although I don't know, if you want to hear a mob boss make a threat like that, you have to hide a microphone in a deli and park outside in a van with a tape recorder all night long. This genius said it on a podcast.”

Kimmel reluctantly gave Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, some credit for saying that the U.S. government shouldn't dictate what people are allowed to hear. He also discussed the other late-night hosts, as well as the support he received from people around the world.

Kimmel said that he heard a lot of different things about what he was supposed to say in the lead-up to his comeback show, but brushed that off as something that wouldn't really matter.

“I don't think what I have to say is going to make much of a difference. If you like me, you like me. If you don't, you don't. I have no illusions about changing anyone's mind. But I do want to make something clear, because it's important to me as a human. And that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man,” Kimmel said, choking up.

Kimmel noted that he posted a message on Instagram the day Kirk was killed, sending love to his family, and also mentioned that he gets death threats and selfishly has every reason not to condone violence.

Kimmel also addressed the fact that even though he was back on the air, he wasn't available everywhere, including markets like St. Louis, Salt Lake City, Nashville, New Orleans, and others. Kimmel's show also isn't airing in Washington, D.C., the market where President Television spends most of his time these days.

Why is Kimmel still banned in various cities? Two companies that own local stations across the country, Sinclair and Nextstar, didn't air Jimmy Kimmel Live on Tuesday as they continue to pretend like Kimmel said something deeply offensive. Combined, the companies own about 22% of all ABC affiliates in the U.S., according to the Wall Street Journal. And it was local broadcasters that Carr said should squeeze people like Kimmel off the air.

It's unclear how the conflict between ABC and the two media companies will be resolved, but Sinclair has demanded that Kimmel make an apology and a sizeable donation to Kirk's political group, Turning Point USA. The host didn't say anything about those demands on Tuesday.

Trump's own tweet Tuesday night didn't even bother to pretend like anything about Kimmel's situation was really about Charlie Kirk.

“I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled!” Trump posted on Truth Social, without explaining precisely the kind of communications that have happened between Trump's goons and ABC.

“Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‘talent' was never there. Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who's not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE,” Trump continued.

Trump allies have repeatedly insisted that Kimmel wasn't taken off the air at the president's insistence. But someone should probably tell Trump that. Because he made a very convoluted argument in his tweet Tuesday making it clear that he would continue to go after Kimmel.

“He is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution,” Trump continued. “I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers! Let Jimmy Kimmel rot in his bad Ratings.”

Trump made a similarly absurd argument about CBS and 60 Minutes giving “campaign contributions” to the Democrats before the company settled with Trump in what was widely viewed as a bribe.

Kimmel didn't publicly comment on anything while he was off the air until midday Tuesday, when he posted a photo of himself with Norman Lear on Bluesky and Instagram, which reads, “Missing this guy today.” Lear was a TV comedy legend who produced hit shows of the 1970s like All in the Family, Sanford and Son, and The Jeffersons. Lear died in 2023.

— Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel.com) September 23, 2025 at 10:16 AM



Kimmel's social media post didn't give any hint about how he would treat his suspension when it came time for the broadcast, but he clearly landed in the right place when all was said and done. And he talked a lot about the dangers that were ahead of us, describing how Stephen Colbert had been pushed out at CBS and showed a screenshot of an old Trump tweet explaining that Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers at NBC would be next. In case you forgot, Trump wrote that Kimmel was “next” back in July after CBS said it wouldn't be renewing Colbert's contract in the spring.

Arguably, the most important aspect of Kimmel's monologue was that it ended with the same tone as other segments from the comedian in recent years. Which is to say that it was irreverent and made fun of Trump's most idiotic comments from recent days. Kimmel played a montage of Trump's press conference from Monday, where he repeatedly told Americans not to take Tylenol and poked fun at the president's unhinged comments at the United Nations on Tuesday.

Kimmel also had Robert DeNiro appear for a segment where the legendary actor played the FCC chairman. DeNiro adopted the mob-boss swagger that we've seen him play in countless movies, and it worked exactly like you'd expect. It wasn't the funniest thing in the world, but it landed a few punches and succeeded at eliciting some chuckles. That's what late-night TV comedy has been about since its inception, and Kimmel made it clear that he would keep doing what he does best as long as ABC would let him.

Whether Trump and Carr let him keep at it is another matter. Because this obviously isn't the end of Kimmel's battle with censorship, as far as Trump is concerned. The president will continue to harass media companies until they're sufficiently deferential. And there are no guarantees that Disney will stand up to Trump if push comes to shove in the future.

At one point, Kimmel made a joke about something Disney was making him read to be allowed back on the air. He pulled out a sheet of paper and told people how to reactivate their Disney+ and Hulu accounts. And while it was clearly a joke, there was probably a lot of truth to what Kimmel was suggesting. Disney almost certainly saw the calls for boycotts and cancellations, as Gizmodo's comment sections were filled with them. And it seems like a substantial number of people really did make good on the threats to cancel.

Without that massive public pressure, it seems very likely that Disney would've pulled the plug on Kimmel for good. Unfortunately, most people who make media aren't quite as high-profile as Kimmel. And when folks like Rumeysa Ozturk get locked up for simply co-writing an op-ed about human rights, there's no streaming service we can cancel to show our support.

But we have to take the wins where we get them. And while we don't know what tomorrow holds, at least Kimmel got a national audience to make his case directly to the American people.

“Look, I never imagined I would be in a situation like this. I barely paid attention in school,” Kimmel said to laughs Tuesday night. “But one thing I did learn from Lenny Bruce and George Carlin and Howard Stern is that a government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn't like is anti-American.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Dive Into the Most Breathtaking Ocean Photos of the Year","https://gizmodo.com/dive-into-the-most-breathtaking-ocean-photos-of-the-year-2000662785","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 09:01:41 GMT","

While floating in the crystal-clear waters of the northern Great Barrier Reef, a sleek, dark shape glided toward Marcia Riederer. The Brazilian-born wildlife and underwater photographer watched as the dwarf minke whale approached, snapping a photo at the exact moment it turned and fixed one eye on her.

“These curious giants approach swimmers with an almost playful curiosity,” Riederer told Oceanographic Magazine. “The whales seem to acknowledge your presence, circling and interacting with you. It's a humbling experience, reaffirming the wonder of the ocean and its inhabitants, and the urgent need to conserve it.”

Her stunning photo, shown above, won Riederer first place in the fine art category of the 2025 Ocean Photographer of the Year awards. This competition, presented by Oceanographic and Blancpain, honors awe-inspiring images that showcase the ocean's beauty and its fragility. Read on to dive into the rest of this year's winning photos.

The yellow pygmy goby is a small, brightly colored fish native to the western Pacific Ocean. Japanese marine researcher Takumi Oyama photographed this one mid-larval dispersal. “In gobiid fishes, male parental care is common, but unusually, in the yellow pigmy goby, females also participate in parental hatching care,” he explained. “This individual is a female, releasing newly hatched larvae into the water column from her mouth.”

Oyama's research focuses on the reproductive ecology of fish, particularly of reef fish in Japan. He conducts scuba-based fieldwork to get up close and personal with marine life, using underwater photography to aid his research and share his observations with the world.

The coast of Nazaré, Portugal, is infamous for its massive waves, producing some of the largest swells ever surfed. French photographer Ben Thouard snapped this dramatic shot on a particularly rough day. “The wind was blowing from the north which makes the surf tricky,” he said. “It was the end of the afternoon; the light was interesting from the beach instead as from the usual cliff view. It was hard to shoot anything because of the big sets and the saltwater in the air. But, eventually, this moment happened.”

Thouard has been photographing the ocean ever since he was a teenager. He is now based in Tahiti—another part of the world known for its powerful waves—where he has developed his unique visual style.

The traditional whaling practice of grindadráp is deeply rooted in centuries of Faroese culture. The hunts were once critical to human survival in the Faroe Islands, but today, conservationists argue that the mass killing of pilot whales poses a significant threat to the species. French photographer and marine biologist Hugo Bret captured this evocative image of a long-finned pilot whale fetus lying lifeless under its mother's corpse after one such hunt.

“Each year, more than 1,000 cetaceans are killed during grindadráp, the slaughter of entire whale groups, including juveniles and pregnant females,” he said. “While these hunts were once an existential necessity, they are no longer subsistence practices. I hope this image drives global attention to end the grindadráp and, at a broader scale, advocates for a reconsideration of what the human relationship with other living beings should be.”

Indo-Pacific leopard sharks were once abundant in the Coral Triangle, an area of exceptional marine biodiversity in the western Pacific. Today, this species is on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) list of endangered species, driven nearly to extinction by overfishing and habitat loss.

This striking photo by Thai photojournalist and marine biologist Sirachai Arunrugsticha offers a glimmer of hope. “An aquarist holds a glass jar with an early-stage embryo of an Indo-Pacific Leopard shark (Stegostoma tigrinum), its egg case removed for a rearing experiment at Aquaria Phuket, one of Thailand's largest private aquariums,” he explained. “Since 2023, the aquarium's staff-driven breeding program has produced over 40 pups of this Endangered species, listed on the IUCN Red List.”

Rescue teams and local community members worked for 15 hours to save this humpback whale that became beached in New South Wales, Australia. Australian ocean and nature photographer Craig Parry documented the tireless effort, snapping this aerial photo.

“Sadly, despite their dedication, she could not be saved,” Parry said. “While the outcome was heartbreaking, witnessing the collaboration and compassion shown by multiple agencies and volunteers was incredibly moving—a powerful reminder of what can be achieved when people come together with a shared purpose.”

These iridescent bobtail squid are wrapped in a tender embrace, mating on the seabed off the coast of the U.K. Underwater photographer and filmmaker Aaron Sanders carefully approached so as not to disturb the pair, capturing this dazzling photo.

“Waves of color rippled across their bodies as chromatophores pulsed in a mesmerizing rhythm, white flickered to gold, gold to red, and back again, transforming them into living, glowing jewels in the dark,” Sanders said. “These otherworldly creatures performed their courtship, creating the next generation of Bobtail squid.”

What looks like hundreds of tiny eyeballs in this male jawfish's mouth is actually his own offspring. Mouthbrooding jawfish protect their fertilized eggs by carrying them around in their mouths for a week or more. During this period, they refrain from eating and regularly “juggle” the eggs—essentially spitting them out then sucking them back in—to make sure they receive enough oxygen.

“2025 was an exceptional year for spotting mouthbrooding males,” said Florida-based underwater and wildlife photographer Matthew Sullivan. “This particular male was quite bold and once he became comfortable with me, he allowed me to take this image.”

Off the coast of Anilao, a barangay in the Philippines, Chinese photographer Jialing Cai snapped this photo of a funky-looking fish that had captured a jellyfish in its mouth. “It potentially grabbed it for chemical defence by taking advantage of the toxins in its tentacles,” Cai explained. “While the fish was holding the jelly in its mouth, it looked like it was blowing a balloon.”

The overall winner of this year's Ocean Photographer of the Year awards is Indonesia-based photographer and dive master Yury Ivanov. He captured this colorful image of two amphipods from the Cyproideidae family, each only measuring around 3 mm in body length, resting on a coral.

These tiny creatures are commonly known as “ladybugs of the sea,” and you can see why. Their black spotted bodies and insect-like features make them look like an otherworldly version of the common winged beetles. “It required a lot of patience and precision to compose and light the shot properly,” Ivanov said. “In total, it took me six dives to get the shot I wanted. The result reveals an intimate glimpse of underwater life that is often overlooked.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Tired of 5G? Qualcomm Says 6G Will Be Here Before the End of the World","https://gizmodo.com/qualcomm-6g-estimated-2028-arrival-2000663048","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 12:26:10 GMT","

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon told the assembled crowd at its Snapdragon Summit in Maui, Hawaii (full disclosure: travel and lodging were paid by Qualcomm, and Gizmodo did not guarantee any coverage as a condition of accepting the trip), that the world can set its watch and clear its calendar for the next generation of wireless connectivity. You'll just have to wait a while. Currently, 5G and 4G LTE are the standard the world over. 6G could allow for faster internet speeds, and the first “pre-commercial devices” with the standard will be here in three years. For so many reasons, I don't have much to look forward to in that time.

I don't enjoy considering the ramifications of 2028. There will be a new round of presidential elections (or maybe not, depending on the authoritarian compulsions of the U.S. commander in chief) that may exacerbate today's political tensions. By then, the always overpromising Sam Altman from OpenAI could be shoving AGI—aka “artificial general intelligence”—in our faces (other major tech CEOs are far more doubtful). Today's tech environment is so muddled and so tenuous that the idea of having any sure idea of the next generation of wireless data seems so much more uncertain. Qualcomm, of course, imagines 6G will have something—anything—to do with AI.

Because of course it is. Qualcomm has chips in a lot of different products, with the majority of them in Android phones. It's powering XR glasses, including the upcoming Xreal “Project Aura” Android XR and the Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses. Its chips are in the Pixel Watch 4. And if all these devices are increasingly pushing AI for everything you do, then Qualcomm needs to facilitate that. According to Amon, the smartphone will just be a hot brick in your pocket used to communicate all that agentic AI goodness to the devices you stick on all parts of your body.

The newfangled 6G would need to send even more data to your devices, which means faster upload and download speeds. To achieve that, Qualcomm needs to make new modems. Amon said the company would need a whole new memory architecture and better NPUs (neural processing units) that can actually do something rather than working in the background on translation and transcription duties. And then comes the big question: will there be a new AI feature worth getting out of bed for? Will the reason people buy a new pair of AR glasses or a cool new smart ring be for AI-specific features? Based on what we've seen from AI-forward devices like the Pixel 10, most users may be able to make do without.

The energy necessary for creating more advanced AI will keep expanding if companies like OpenAI and Google stay on this path. Nvidia's recently announced $100 billion partnership with OpenAI would build out new cloud systems as early as 2026 (requiring yet-unheard-of levels of electrical power to run it all). When Amon positions 6G as necessary for the next stage of AI development while centering the eventual release for 2028, or likely beyond, it makes it sound as if there could be a bottleneck in either connectivity or processing power that will hinder this new age of computing.

“The amount of data will dwarf the existence of models,” Amon said.

After speaking with Qualcomm, it's clear the company is doing its best to look forward. It can't possibly know the use case for 6G, even though the presence of AI mandates that it will be a more substantial update over the 5G standard. It's impossible to develop technology when we truly don't know what shape AI—or tech in general—will take in three years. Hype always outstrips the physical capabilities of our gadgets. Consumer-ready devices with 6G will come closer to 2030, at least according to the chipmaker.

Companies like Microsoft tell us the age of agentic AI—artificial intelligence systems that work in tandem to complete complex tasks—is already here. The age of AR glasses seems to be imminent with the Meta Ray-Ban Display on the horizon. What will we do in the meantime? I honestly can't envision 2028. Without subscribing to a self-satisfied sense of doomerism—where I can talk out the side of my mouth and claim “the world will probably end before 2028”—I do honestly believe that our current tech hype bubble will inevitably move on. And in any case, by 2028, 6G will be the least of our concerns.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Denis Villeneuve May Not Start Casting His James Bond Until After ‘Dune: Part Three'","https://gizmodo.com/james-bond-casting-amazon-denis-villeneive-story-rumors-2000663201","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 16:31:17 GMT","

Ever since Denis Villeneuve was announced as the director of the next James Bond movie, there's been rampant speculation over just who might be stepping into the shoes left behind in Daniel Craig's explosive departure. But a new report suggests that for all of Amazon's quick movement once it got control of the franchise, it might be a good while longer until the search for the next 007 gets underway.

A new report by Deadline today suggests that Villeneuve won't begin the hunt for his new Bond in earnest until next year, once production is completed on his third (and most likely final) Dune film, Dune: Part Three, which began filming this past June. Although principal photography for Part Two was around five months, an end date for Part Three remains unknown (and it's perhaps likely that Villeneuve will want to focus on elements of post-production into 2026 before shifting priorities to Bond).

Although Deadline's report says that the search for the next face of the franchise hasn't truly begun yet, that doesn't mean that there aren't at least some guidelines that Villeneuve and Amazon are honing their search on. According to the trade, the studio is looking for a British man, relatively unknown, in their late 20s or early 30s (so alas, put aside your Toms Hardy, your Idrises Elba, and perhaps even your Toms Holland—and absolutely your Pierces Brosnan, whatever he says) by the time the film begins shooting some time in 2027.

Also intriguing to note in the report is the idea that the new film may potentially focus on Bond's career in the Royal Navy, depicting his time as a commander before he's tapped by MI6 and eventually earns his 00-agent status. Although the direction of Stephen Knight's script is still in the air as it's being written, that potential focus is interestingly timed. After the conclusion of Craig's era as Bond, a full-on reboot that envisions the character's rise to the elite wings of British spycraft makes sense, but it will also mean it comes fascinatingly timed with next year's 007 First Light.

A lot of the big draw of IO Interactive's splashy new video game take on Bond is that it will similarly chart the story of a young Bond—the youngest we've seen so far at 26, depending on the eventual age of Villeneuve and Amazon's pick—as he joins MI6 and rises through the ranks to 00-status. Obviously a video game and a new movie (that may not be out for a couple years after First Light‘s release) are very different things, but it'd be interesting to see if this new era of Bond starts out with two major projects that explore the early days of the legendary spy.

Either way, with the hunt for the next big screen Bond not happening quite so soon, and First Light not out until March 2026, it's going to be a while until we really see what's next for James.

Most of us use streaming services to watch just about everything at this point. Heck, even YouTube has a premium model for those of us who don't want to deal with adverts, so we're only getting more of them as time goes on. While TVs can be good for covering all of this stuff, those who want a smoother experience will often do well to go for a dedicated streaming device instead.

The Roku Streambar SE is a great streaming device that also doubles as a soundbar, making it a great pickup for a whole host of people. While it would normally cost you $100, it's currently down to $79 instead, making it a great time to upgrade your home entertainment system while this deal lasts.

See at Amazon

As a soundbar, this device has two front-facing speakers that help it push audio into a room and fill it with sound. It means that you'll be able to enjoy enhanced audio, but it also has a dedicated bass port to ensure amazing depth of sound. Plus, it has a mode that actually enhances the speech of anything you're watching specifically, which is great for people who feel like the chatter is always too quiet. It's us, we're the people who think that the chatter is always too quiet, we don't want to have to turn things up when people are talking, then immediately panic when an explosion happens.

Along with that, it's still a really good streaming device. That means that you can easily access all of your favorite streaming services in one place, and easily switch between them with less hassle. It supports 4K visuals as well, which means you're going to be getting some great-looking and great-sounding shows and films. It's also surprisingly easy to set up, which is great for those who are tech-averse, and the remote means you can handle the audio and the streaming side of things all at the same time with the same device. We've all lost one of the three controllers at one point or another, so this is a big win.

Given that this combines two devices into one, and they're both really helpful, you'd expect this to cost more than it does at the full price of $100. So, if you do want a nice boost to your entertainment system, being able to get it while it's down to $79 instead is a great opportunity.

AI slop, or is it actually convenient?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A few months ago, Thermaltake took the covers off its MagFloe Ultra lineup of all-in-one (AIO) liquid coolers that have a pretty neat-looking display, along with flagship specs. These coolers are controlled by the TT RGB Plus software that has a bunch of built-in animations for the 3.4-inch LCD on the pump. It can not only display images and videos, but also overlays the weather, time, and CPU/GPU telemetry data on top. Unfortunately, these elements are bound by certainty and lack imagination — and Thermaltake is here to fix that with its new ""AI Forge"" feature.

Yes, your liquid cooler, whose sole job is to keep your CPU temperatures in check, now has AI. Inside the TT RGB Plus 3.0 app, there exists ""a studio without walls"" that will allow you to generate custom videos and images with your own prompts. The selling point here is that you don't need to fiddle with third-party services; new animations can be made and saved right inside Thermaltake's software, ready to be applied to your cooler's screen. These custom backgrounds can then be overlaid with the aforementioned time, weather, or hardware monitoring data.

 




In the graphic the company provided for this announcement, we can see a text box that seems to already provide suggestions to give you a head start. It's reasonable to believe this AI model will not run locally and will require an internet connection. Thermaltake did not say whether AI Forge will also work on the TT PlayLink mobile app that can be used to change the screen backgrounds on MagFloe Ultra coolers as well. As far as we can tell, this is the first instance of AI implemented on any PC cooler — not that it helps much anywhere else.

Whether you consider this a genuinely useful feature or just AI slop, the MagFloe Ultra coolers themselves are no gimmick. They come in two variants: 360mm and 420mm, and both are high-performance AIOs with slim radiators, low-noise pumps, and easy installation with pogo-pin connectors. You get 120mm or 140mm ARGB fans with swappable fan blades, along with two years of warranty, which is plenty of time to drive up those tokens in AI Forge. Anyhow, if you're a fan of screens on things that were fine without them, make sure to check out V-Color's new OLED RAM sticks.

A secure boot a day keeps a virus away.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Ever since the release of Windows 11, if you're a PC gamer, you've definitely heard the term ""Secure Boot."" It's required to play a myriad of different games these days — mainly competitive shooters — and serves as one part of the two-punch security knockout consisting of TPM and Secure Boot. These features help keep your system protected from bad actors, and now Valve has just made it super convenient to check whether you're ahead of the curve. In the latest Steam beta, you can easily see your Secure Boot status in the settings.

If you open Steam and go to ""Help"" in the menu bar and click on ""System Information,"" you'll be bombarded with a bunch of stats about your PC. Just scroll down till you see the ""Operating System"" heading, and you should see a list item for Secure Boot, telling you if it's enabled. This makes it easier for gamers who get inundated with information to ensure they're not excluded. While you're there, you'll see your TPM status as well, which is the other big security feature of Windows 11 and a requirement for (official) compatibility with the OS.

 




TPM stands for Trusted Platform Module, and it's a little hardware block that's cordoned off from the rest of the system because it houses ultra-sensitive cryptographic keys. It works hand-in-hand with Secure Boot to check if anything has changed since the last known good boot. It does that by recording hashes at each stage of every boot run to tally against, which is just one secret, along with many others (like BitLocker encryption keys) that are stored away in this chip. TPM is a requirement in most modern online games, just like Secure Boot.

Secure Boot works to ensure that only trusted, signed software runs when your PC starts, in an effort to sift out any shady programs. It's a kernel-level security feature, so it enjoys the highest level of privilege on your system — something that its critics often point toward as a vulnerability. Secure Boot, in essence, is a novel concept and is designed to do what it says: make your boot secure, but sometimes the amount of access it has can raise questions.

 




That's because most anti-cheat software is reliant on Secure Boot as it's essentially responsible for creating a safe space for the anti-cheat right as your system is starting, from where on out the anti-cheat can catch any exploits or malicious code itself. This can get really territorial, as recently seen with EA's Javelin in Battlefield 6. Without Secure Boot (and often TPM), some games won't even launch, so it's important to enable it if you see it turned off in Steam. To do so, you need to head over to your BIOS; check your motherboard manufacturer's guides for more info.

Strix Halo provides the Win 5 with unparalleled levels of handheld performance, especially beyond 30 watts.

More content creators are getting their hands on GPD's incredibly potent Win 5 handheld gaming PC, sporting AMD's flagship Strix Halo APU. YouTube hardware tester The Phawx has turned in his initial impressions of the handheld, particularly against competing AMD handhelds with more ""conventional"" hardware. He found the GPD Win 5 is up to twice as fast as competing Ryzen AI 9 HX 370-powered handhelds while consuming the same amount of power (at 25W to 35W TDP).

The Phawx provided a limited benchmark comparison between the flagship Ryzen AI Max 395+-powered GPD Win 5 and a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370-powered handheld system. In these comparisons, the GPD Win 5 shows an astonishing amount of performance headroom thanks to the RTX 4060-class GPU on the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 SoC.

In Returnal, the GPD Win 5 ran at nearly twice the framerate as the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 handheld The Phawx was using for these tests with both systems running at the same 25-watt power limit. The GPD Win 5 produced about 80 FPS, and the HX 370-powered handheld ran at around 45 FPS.

In Doom: The Dark Ages; the GPD Win 5 ran at 56 FPS, and the HX 370-powered handheld turned out 31 FPS. The cherry on top is that the GPD Win 5 was running at higher graphical fidelity using FSR Quality upscaling instead of FSR Balanced on the HX 370 handheld.

Furthermore, the Strix Halo 395+ offers even greater performance margins at higher power limits, thanks to its impressive specifications. According to these tests, the GPD Win 5's implementation of the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 only starts hitting diminishing performance returns at 40 watts or greater. By contrast, HX 370-handhelds start producing diminishing performance returns at 18 watts or greater.

In God of War: Ragnarok, The Phawx reports that the GPD Win 5 runs at around 85 FPS at 25 watts, and the HX 370-powered handheld 67 FPS at the same power limit. However, bumping up the power limit to 70 watts on the GPD Win 5 produces a colossal jump all the way up to 176 FPS.

The only caveat with the GPD Win 5's monstrous APU is that it doesn't behave well at ultra-low power limits. Below 25 watts, the Win 5's Strix Halo APU reportedly produces performance results that are barely any better than the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. This performance behavior also extends to CPU-bound titles, since both CPUs take advantage of the same Zen 5 CPU architecture.

Still, these initial tests demonstrate the sheer power Strix Halo can offer when squeezed inside of a handheld gaming PC. Strix Halo wasn't designed to be a handheld gaming chip; it's more commonly seen in laptops and mini-PCs. Its massive 442mm² die sports 16 Zen 5 CPU cores and an RDNA 3.5 GPU with as many compute units as a PS5 (40 CUs in all). Somehow, GPD was able to figure out a way to fit this monstrous chip inside of its Win 5 handheld without sacrificing comfort or usability.

Once it hits the market, the GPD Win 5 will likely be the world's first handheld to be powered by Strix Halo, and will almost certainly be the fastest handheld in the world as a result. The device will come in three trims: a baseline model sporting the Ryzen AI Max 385 with 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, a mid-range option with the same storage and memory but with the flagship Ryzen AI Max+ 395, and there's a top-of-the-line model with the 395 chip, 64GB of RAM, and a 4TB SSD.

To compete with AMD and Nvidia.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


New code unearthed in Intel's Arc graphics driver files could point to the company's plans to launch its own answer to Nvidia's multi-frame generation tech. Multi-frame generation, or MFG for short, debuted in Nvidia's keynote last year as part of its pitch for the RTX 50 series. Ada Lovelace could already do regular frame gen — inserting an AI-generated frame between two real ones — but Blackwell took it one step further — using up to three interpolated frames created from an actually rendered one. So far, neither Intel nor AMD has an answer to this, though that appears to be changing soon, according to the r/IntelArc subreddit.

Scouring through the latest Arc drivers, user u/Organic-Bird-587 stumbled upon a mention of ""Multi-Frame Generation (XeSS)"" in the files. That was accompanied by an image that could potentially be the new logo for Intel's MFG, suggesting that the chipmaker might be working on its own multi-frame generation tech set to debut soon. Despite Arc facing fresh scrutiny following the recent Nvidia-Intel deal, the company is still believed to be working on Battlemage — its current-gen discrete GPU architecture — and states it remains committed to its Arc graphics project, which could include its fabled B770 card.

Pairing up the B770 launch with MFG could be a huge win for Intel, netting them an answer to Nvidia's multi-frame tech. AMD currently offers no MFG solution of its own, so this could be the moment to establish a unique selling point for Arc versus AMD graphics cards. Still, it's important to note that this is purely speculative, and finding trinkets of unreleased or unannounced products is commonplace in driver code — until there's confirmation from Intel, take this with a huge grain of salt, although it would make sense given the current landscape.

Nvidia's historic $5 billion investment into Intel last week seemed to put the company's Arc graphics lineup in jeopardy, especially after the announcement that would see Intel create new chips featuring GPU chiplets from Nvidia. Intel later clarified that Arc will remain in development and that RTX GPUs are ""complementary"" — a stance that lines up with this news, as MFG is purely Nvidia's play at the moment, so offering a competitor to that almost reinforces hope that Arc is still on the battlefront, fighting to carve out its own space in a crowded market.

 




It's important to keep in mind that multi-frame generation is not a revolutionary concept and has its critics. Notably, Borderlands 4's rocky launch and Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford's insistence that users rely on the tech to make the resource-hungry title playable haven't gone down well with fans.

MFG requires a decent baseline framerate to build upon, and it introduces latency in the process. There's also a third-party solution, called Lossless Scaling, that is rising in popularity, promising up to 20x frame generation. It costs $7 but works with most GPUs. Just like XeSS works with every GPU (supporting Shader Model 6.4) after its recent update, if Intel is really working on XeSS MFG as we speak, it has the potential to democratize frame generation and make it as accessible as tweaking a DLL.

How many tickets can a parking cop issue in a day?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A software engineer named Riley Walz has built a website that scrapes the data from the City of San Francisco website, allowing him to track issued parking tickets in real-time and the location where the officers wrote them. The information is readily available on the Find My Parking Cops web app, and uses an interface similar to Apple's Find My app, making it quick and easy to use.

Overlaid on a top-down view of San Francisco, you get a list of active officers at the moment, plus a leaderboard showing the total value of the tickets a particular officer has issued for the current week. Walz shared his creation on X — A few hours later, the City took down the website date, briefly rendering his creation useless. Nevertheless, he was able to create a workaround, restoring the functionality of the tracking site, at least for now.

According to Walz, he was inspired to create the page after his roommate received a parking ticket. The website where you pay the penalty also shows a full copy of the citation, as long as you have its number. When you input the correct information, you'll see all the details related to the parking offence, including the make, color, and license plate of the offending vehicle, the reason for the ticket, and the issuing officer's initials.

One other roadblock that he encountered was the ticket number — at the moment, the system lists nearly a billion tickets, but he thinks that this is nowhere near the real number of parking violations in San Francisco. When he added one to the ticket that his friend had, the San Francisco website returned an error. But after some more experimentation and digging around, he discovered the tickets were numbered by increments of 11, except for when the last digit is 6, by which you add 4 to get the next ticket number. This pattern allowed him to predict the next parking citation to be issued, making for easier tracking. He was also able to figure out the claim ID, allowing him to pull out all the details of the ticket.

Armed with this information, he created a scraper that copied and stored all the parking tickets as soon as they were created. They then used a borrowed Apple Maps API key to put the data on a map, allowing anyone to see the locations, the number of tickets, as well as the total fines a particular parking cop has issued during their shift. Naturally, this information could be used to avoid parking fines, a benefit Walz himself touts, with users able to see a rough spread of where parking cops might be issuing tickets at any given time.

While not exactly illegal, this shows how easy it can be to gather data from the internet if you know what you're doing. However, it can also raise some privacy issues, especially since the parking tickets often have personal data on them. The City of San Francisco definitely needs to secure its parking ticket system, but it also needs to ensure that citizens can retain easy access to the payment portal to settle their violations. In the meantime, this map is available for anyone to see, that is, until San Francisco fixes their system and makes it just a little bit more secure.

The results of OASIS 4 phase 3 trial, which demonstrated the safety and efficacy of once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg for weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity, are now published.

The results were first presented late last year during Obesity Week 2024 and reported by Medscape Medical News at that time.

The full trial results were published online on September 17 in The New England Journal of Medicine.

The US FDA is set to decide on Novo Nordisk's new drug application for oral semaglutide 25 mg for chronic weight management in adults living with obesity or overweight later this year. If approved, it would become the first oral formulation of a GLP-1 indicated for chronic weight management.

The approval of oral semaglutide “should and will change and enhance the practice of obesity medicine. This medication should be easier to make and distribute than injectables that require refrigeration and a cold-chain system,” OASIS 4 investigator Sean Wharton, MD, with the University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and the Wharton Weight Management Clinic, Burlington, Ontario, told Medscape Medical News.

In OASIS 4, the efficacy of oral semaglutide 25 mg was “quite good with tolerable adverse effects in keeping with GLP-1s,” Wharton added.

Semaglutide is currently approved in the US for weight management as a once-weekly subcutaneous injection. In a recent trial, a 50-mg dose of once-daily oral semaglutide resulted in significantly greater weight loss than placebo. However, the efficacy and safety of lower doses of oral semaglutide were unclear.

To fill this gap, OASIS 4 randomly assigned 307 adults with diabetes with BMI ≥ 30 or with BMI ≥ 27 and at least one obesity-related complication to receive once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg or matching placebo, along with lifestyle intervention.

Among patients who adhered to treatment, those receiving oral semaglutide 25 mg achieved average weight loss of 16.6% compared to 2.7% in those receiving placebo at 64 weeks (P < .0001).

Regardless of strict adherence to treatment, patients receiving oral semaglutide still achieved an average weight loss of 13.6% compared with 2.2% in those receiving placebo (P < .001).

Patients in the oral semaglutide group were also significantly more likely to have a reduction of at least 5% in body weight than those in the placebo group.

From baseline to week 64, 79.2% vs 31.1% of those in the semaglutide vs placebo group lost ≥ 5% of body weight, 63.0% vs 14.4% lost ≥ 10%; 50.0% vs 5.6% lost ≥ 15%; and 29.7% vs 3.3% lost ≥ 20%. All differences were statistically significant at P < .0001.

Weight loss results with oral semaglutide 25 mg were similar to that achieved in previous trials involving oral semaglutide 50 mg and subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg.

Oral semaglutide 25 mg was also associated with improved physical function and substantial reductions in cardiometabolic risk factors including BMI, waist circumference, levels of glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, fasting serum insulin, lipids (very low-density lipoprotein and triglycerides), and C-reactive protein.

Notably, most patients with prediabetes at baseline had normoglycemia at the end of semaglutide treatment, the researchers reported.

Overall adverse events occurred in 93.1% of patients receiving oral semaglutide and in 85.3% of those receiving placebo, and gastrointestinal adverse events occurred in 74.0% and 42.2% of patients, respectively. Most of the events were mild or moderate in severity and were resolved without a need for permanent discontinuation of the regimen, the researchers said.

Taken together, the results of OASIS 4 support oral semaglutide 25 mg as an efficacious option for obesity, they concluded.

Wharton told Medscape Medical News, this study is “going to change practice. If taking a pill is what you prefer, you will have the option.”

The OASIS 4 study was funded by Novo Nordisk. Disclosures for authors are available at nejm.org.

Could oral microbiome profiling help spot people at risk for pancreatic cancer?

It may be possible, according to a recent analysis published in JAMA Oncology.

Researchers found that a microbial risk score derived from oral wash samples may help identify people at an increased risk for pancreatic cancer, which could be a step toward earlier detection of the deadly malignancy.

“We identified 27 individual bacterial and fungal species significantly associated with pancreatic cancer development,” said Jiyoung Ahn of NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York City.

“If validated, oral microbiome profiling could serve as a noninvasive biomarker to identify individuals at elevated risk who might benefit from enhanced surveillance,” Ahn told Medscape Medical News by email.

Rates of pancreatic cancer are on the rise. But detecting the disease before it becomes unresectable has remained an elusive goal, and the US Preventive Services Task Force discourages screening of asymptomatic adults.

For their study, Ahn and her colleagues analyzed data from 122,000 participants who provided oral wash samples as part of two cohort studies conducted in the US. The researchers used whole-genome shotgun sequencing and internal transcribed spacer sequencing to identity the bacterial and fungal species in the samples, respectively.

Over a median follow-up of nearly 9 years, 445 people developed pancreatic cancer and were matched with 445 who did not. Three oral bacterial periodontal pathogens — Porphyromonas gingivalis (odds ratio [OR], 1.27), Eubacterium nodatum (OR, 1.42), and Parvimonas micra (OR, 1.36) — as well as the fungal genus Candida were all linked to significantly increased odds of developing pancreatic cancer.

In a bacteriome-wide scan, the researchers pinpointed another 20 oral bacteria associated with pancreatic cancer — eight with a decreased risk and 13 with an increased risk for the disease.

The researchers also calculated a microbial risk score, which was the weighted sum of the relative abundance of bacterial and fungal species. In a meta-analysis of data from the two cohorts, the microbial risk score derived from 23 bacterial species and four fungal species, including various Candida species, was associated with more than a threefold increased risk for pancreatic cancer (multivariate OR per 1-SD increase in the score, 3.44; 95% CI, 2.63-4.51).

“The oral microbiota holds promise as a biomarker to identify individuals at high risk of pancreatic cancer, potentially enabling personalized pancreatic cancer prevention,” Ahn and her colleagues concluded.

But Gil Welch, MD, general internist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who has written about screening for decades, isn't so sure.

Given the “impressive volume of information” included in the analysis, “it is not surprising that the investigators are able to create a microbial risk score (based on 27 species of bacteria and fungi) that is highly related to pancreatic cancer,” Welch said. “The authors are careful to emphasize these are associations, not causal relationships.”

But even if the relationship were causal, finding more people with the malignancy can also have downsides, said Welch.

In a study out last year, Welch and colleagues found that while the incidence of pancreatic cancer among young Americans has been rising, mortality rates in this demographic haven't budged, suggesting a potential for overdiagnosis.

“Screening for pancreatic cancer has never been shown to reduce pancreatic cancer mortality,” Welch told Medscape Medical News. “Why screen large swaths of the population simply to enumerate ‘risk factors' for an unproven benefit that, at best, could help only a few? Meanwhile, the burdens for everyone else are real: the mental and financial strains of ‘high risk' labels, false alarms, and endless follow-ups. It's a recipe to make us all worried sick — and poorer.”

Ahn reported having no disclosures. Welch reported receiving royalties from three books including “Should I be tested for cancer?”

 September 24, 2025  

Merry Jennifer Markham, MD, didn't realize it until COVID hit, but she had been relying on travel to help shield her from burnout.

Getting away several times a year had kept the Moffitt Cancer Center oncologist in Tampa, Florida, going. Then, in 2020, that option was suddenly gone.

As June 2021 rolled around, she and her husband were almost ready to leave on their first trip since the pandemic. But instead of excitement, she felt a looming disappointment. The planning and daydreaming part of her trip was over.

That night at dinner, she mused to her husband, “How amazing would it be to have a job to plan people's travel?”

Then it dawned on her — that was a job.

Within 2 months, she started her limited liability company for a travel agency. 

“Here we are, four plus years later, and I am still doing it. I'm in love with it, and it doesn't feel like work,” she told Medscape Medical News.

Markham is one of many oncologists filling their evenings and weekends with side gigs and part-time hustles. A 2025 Medscape survey reported that, on top of day-to-day patient care, a whopping 39% of doctors take on a side hustle. For oncologists, the side gig may be an extension of their cancer care, working as a medical consultant or an expert witness. Others, like Markham, branch out into something totally different, such as real estate, farming, or writing. These endeavors bring in some extra income — earning $32,000, on average — but perhaps more importantly, these gigs can provide opportunities for creativity, fun, and stress relief.

Although these gigs often mean packing even more into a single day, the four doctors Medscape Medical News spoke to found relief and pleasure in their side hustles.

For Markham, planning trips for other people — even though she wasn't doing the actual traveling — proved to be a release valve of sorts. The joy and anticipation of travel were a welcome balance to the sobering elements of cancer care. Time spent daydreaming and planning trips for others even made the clinic work more enjoyable. 

“As soon as I got this thing started, that's when I realized I was kind of burned out,” Markham recalled. With this new gig, “I was feeding a part of my brain I didn't know needed to be fed.” 

At first, Markham was just planning trips for her friends and colleagues. She'd come home from a day in the clinic and put together a vacation to South Africa or the South of France. 

But then things took off. Reviews of her business spread by word of mouth, and pretty soon she had a swelling customer base of doctors and other busy professionals who wanted to travel but didn't have the time — or desire — to plan it all out. 

Markman had to expand her business. “The only way I could maintain serving our travel clients was to hire a team,” she said. And today, the side-gig revenue comfortably pays for Markham's personal travels.

In many ways, Markham's two jobs seem like total opposites, but they overlap in one important way: a reminder to live life to the fullest.

Because of oncology, “I am so aware of how limited our time is,” she said. Patients regularly turn up in her exam room 6 months after they retire, and cancer cuts their long-held travel plans short.

For Markman, it makes perfect sense for an oncologist to plan exciting vacations. “It ties into that urgency of making memories while you can,” she said. 

Pallav Mehta, MD, sees a similar through-line from his clinic work at MD Anderson Cancer Center at Cooper, Meadowbrook, Pennsylvania, to his side hustle. 

The 51-year-old breast cancer specialist spends some of his late-night hours reviewing cases as an expert medical witness. He pores over thousands of pages of records for every case, typically breast cancer-related, and leverages his expertise to help defense and plaintiff attorneys understand what happened — and sometimes what should have happened. 

Mehta started the expert witness gig for the extra income, but about a year after he began working cases, he did his first deposition and trial. That was a game changer.

“It was an adrenaline rush,” he told Medscape Medical News. “The patient's family is there. They are staring at you. The 12 jury members are staring at you,” he said. “There's this feeling of being on an elevated stage.”

The stage has always been a draw for Mehta. He has been writing jokes for his children and toying with a comedy bit for nearly 20 years. But it wasn't until he saw his children start performing that he recognized the same draw in himself.

Even “as an oncologist, when you open the door [to a patient room], you're on stage,” he said. “When you walk in, they are watching your face, staring at your expression. There's a performative aspect to it — in a truthful way — but still a performance.”

His medical-legal work offered a seamless way to transition his clinical expertise to a bigger stage. Each time he takes the stand, he relies on a skill set refined by decades of oncology work.

Although oncology-focused, the legal work still offers a departure from the intensity of the clinic. Over the years, Mehta began seeing a growing volume of patients. These patients were getting more treatments and experiencing greater side effects. He eventually became one of the busiest breast oncologists in the MD Anderson network.

The heaviness and volume of it all began to weigh on Mehta, and he felt a growing sense of agitation and depersonalization in the clinic and at home. He knew it was time to take a step back.

In early 2023, Mehta added a second side gig that allowed him to move to part-time clinic work. He joined a startup called Reimagine Care as the medical director. The startup, which offers patients artificial intelligence-based virtual support, digital monitoring, and 24/7 access to oncology experts, allowed him to help patients with cancer outside the bustle of daily care, which was a welcome reprieve. “It just helps me so much to enjoy my patient care.”

Tiffany Troso-Sandoval, MD, an oncologist specializing in breast and gynecologic cancers, was doing 3-5 second opinions a week at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. For nearly every patient, she was shocked at how little they understood about their condition and care plan.

“I observed thousands and thousands of women not understanding what was going on, which caused extreme overwhelm and anxiety and distrust,” Troso-Sandoval said. 

In 2023, she decided she needed to reach more than one patient at a time. She started writing her first book — a complete blueprint of the cancer process, educating the reader about every test and step from diagnosis to treatment. 

Then, in 2024, her own health started creating obstacles. 

A genetic eye condition made her clinic work — and sometimes 18 hours a day on a computer screen — untenable. She made the choice to retire from Memorial Sloan Kettering after 25 years and go all in on patient education.

Troso-Sandoval's side hustles soon became her main jobs.

She built an educational module to help patients understand their diagnosis, their tests, and their procedures. And she started a virtual second-opinion company, Second Look Oncology, where she spends 90 minutes with patients to help them understand every scan, pathology test, and diagnosis.

Juggling two businesses and multiple writing projects offers her autonomy and diversity she didn't have in the clinic. But these new ventures also help her stay connected to the field. 

“I'm not leaving oncology,” she said. But she is using her clinical skillset to creatively fill a chasm she's been passionate about for a long time.

For Monique Gary, MD, her side hustle arose from her patient care. The Pennsylvania-based breast surgical oncologist kept getting similar questions from patients about food, lifestyle, and natural remedies: What should I be eating? What can I do to fight this naturally?

But she couldn't answer them.

“The separation between medicine and nature is palpable to patients,” Gary said. In 2018, at a time when doctors were unable to engage and answer questions about integrative therapies and diet, “I really set out to learn and to create a space to learn.”

That space was Still Rise Farms — a 40-acre farm Gary bought in 2020 that serves as a wellness destination for people battling cancer.

Gary and her staff offer quarterly workshops, yoga, fishing, meditation, cooking demonstrations, gardening, and therapy-related natural discussions. There's chair yoga for the patients who aren't able to stand for the whole class, and waist-high raised gardening beds so patients don't have to bend over so far. There's even a community-supported agriculture program to help with food insecurity among patients with cancer.

“Having a farm is not for the faint of heart,” Gary said. 

The Philadelphia-born doctor had no experience with tractors, pond algae, or agriculture of any kind. The learning curve has been huge, and at times, managing a fully functioning farm on top of surgical oncology has been “a heavy lift.”

But as stressful as it can be, “it provides me with great satisfaction,” Gary said.

Still Rise Farms is a way for her to offer more than surgery, a way to support patients emotionally and spiritually, and restore their trust. “Because people have lost so much trust in healthcare providers,” she said. “And some of that has to do with our attitudes and our approach to the questions they are asking.”

On the farm, Gary embraces wellness options that can help sustain patients through their medical treatment and even help them stay on treatments that may have challenging side effects.

“I think it does help patients understand that [they] can continue on this medication,” Gary said. Even if it's causing joint pain or insomnia, there are options to deal with those side effects that don't involve taking another pill.

At the end of the day, it's that kind of patient empowerment she's after. Seeing the same patients that start out sleepless and afraid feel seen, equipped, and empowered, “That's what makes it worth it; that is a gift to me that I get to watch it,” she said.

Dawn  Attride

 September 24, 2025  

In Cleveland's humid summer heat, Michal Gostkowski, DO, doesn't need a jacket. In fall, perhaps a light coat. As winter's cold bite creeps in, he'll be sure to bundle up.

Just like changing outerwear when the weather shifts, the brains of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) sometimes need adjusting throughout the day. That's the idea behind a newly cleared adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) device now being used to treat PD, said Gostkowski, neurologist at Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland. As the patient's brain and symptoms fluctuate throughout the day, aDBS adjusts in real time, offering tailored control.

While conventional DBS (cDBS) has been a cornerstone treatment for nearly 30 years, it has clear limitations. cDBS delivers constant, fixed electrical stimulation to targeted brain regions but can't adjust to symptom fluctuations or the effects of medication. This can result in significant side effects, including dyskinesia.

In contrast, aDBS is a closed-loop system that offers a personalized alternative. By monitoring brain activity in real time and adjusting stimulation dynamically, this next-generation technology delivers greater symptom control with fewer side effects.

Neurologists in North America, Europe, and Asia are adopting the therapy to help preserve patients' independence and function, offering hope for millions living with the disease.

The response, so far, has been promising. Of Gostkowski's 75 patients using aDBS, to date, none has discontinued the therapy.

“This has been very advantageous for most patients,” Gostkowski told Medscape Medical News. “It just seems to provide what the body is missing, what the brain's not doing by itself, and patients really like it.”

In February, manufacturer Medtronic received FDA clearance for BrainSense aDBS and the BrainSense Electrode Identifier system, making it the first and only aDBS system cleared for clinical use in PD.

The approval was the culmination of more than a decade of research into refining aDBS — from determining which brain wave frequencies correlate to Parkinson's motor symptoms to further identifying which signals were safe and effective enough to drive the aDBS system.

In 2018, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), first implanted aDBS in two patients with PD, demonstrating that it was as effective at controlling symptoms as cDBS.

The procedure involves inserting electrodes into the brain and implanting a battery-powered pulse generator under the collarbone. The implanted leads are placed deep into the tiniest brain structures including the subthalamic nucleus where they pick up local field potentials. Within these signals, abnormal beta-band frequencies in the 13-30 Hz range activate the aDBS system.

Stimulation then modulates the disrupted beta waves in patients with PD, helping to alleviate certain motor symptoms.

A pivotal clinical trial — ADAPT-PD — led by Helen Bronte-Stewart, MD, MS, professor of neurology at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, served as the basis for FDA clearance of the technology.

The results of this 2020 multicenter, prospective, single-blind, randomized crossover trial were published in JAMA Neurology this week. Among the study's 68 participants (70.6% men; mean age, 62.2 years; disease duration, 13.5 years), most had effective “on” time (defined as time when symptoms were well controlled) without experiencing troublesome dyskinesia compared with cDBS.

“More than two thirds of study participants indicated a ‘strong' or ‘somewhat' preference for aDBS over their previous cDBS settings for improved motor symptoms or fewer symptom fluctuations,” the investigators wrote.

There needs to be sufficient beta power close to the electrode to drive the system, Bronte-Stewart told Medscape Medical News. “If there isn't enough of a signal recordable, then adaptive deep brain stimulation won't work, and that often depends on where the lead is in the brain,” she said.

Selecting patients with realistic expectations is key with aDBS, Gostkowski emphasized. Older patients and those with preexisting gait and speech problems are at a greater risk for stimulation-induced side effects, said Martijn Beudel, MD, PhD, neurologist and associate professor at Amsterdam University Medical Center (UMC) in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

In addition, patients with significant cognitive impairment or dementia are typically ineligible because the surgery itself may pose risks. Nonmotor symptoms of PD — such as swallowing difficulties, drooling, or blood pressure regulation — are not improved with this technology.

Some patients hope for improvements in memory or freezing of gait, Gostkowski noted, but these symptoms are unlikely to respond, which can lead to confusion about what aDBS can, and cannot, achieve. 

Rand Laycock, a 70-year-old music conductor who had been using cDBS to treat his PD, was a good fit for aDBS, Gostkowski said. Since Laycock switched from cDBS to the adaptive system earlier this year, the impact has been profound.

“My tremor is almost all gone, except if I experience extreme anxiety or stress — and my dyskinesia is pretty well under control,” Laycock said in a Cleveland Clinic patient profile. “My symptoms are minimal compared to the way they were, and a lot of that is due to the adaptive deep brain stimulation.”

In fact, aDBS has enabled him to continue his 47-year career on the podium.

Clinical data reinforce such patient-reported outcomes. A recent study led by UCSF researchers showed that aDBS improved symptoms and quality of life in patients with PD while reducing common side effects of cDBS.

Patients like Laycock who transition to aDBS require no further surgery — the Medtronic's Percept DBS system can be updated via software to activate its adaptive setting.

Although patients with the Percept device installed can technically update to aDBS, that doesn't always mean they should.

“It takes a long time to set someone in an adaptive DBS mode, and the juice may not be worth the squeeze for many patients with well-placed DBS leads,” Michael Okun, MD, medical advisor for the Parkinson's Foundation and author of the book The Parkinson's Plan, told Medscape Medical News in an email.

Bronte-Stewart chimed a similar note. She cautioned against framing aDBS as a revolutionary alternative that patients must have. Rather, she said, it should be viewed as a personalized biological therapy vs an entirely new treatment.

Worldwide, more than 160,000 patients with PD have DBS implants, though it's unclear how many are using aDBS. However, Medtronic reports that to date, over 40,000 people globally have the Percept device.

“The exact number of clinics using aDBS is still small. The barriers for implementation include the need for clinician training, the complexity of programming, and insurance reimbursement hurdles,” Okun said.

In the US, the cost of DBS ranges from $70,000 to $100,000. Gostkowski and Brett Youngerman, MD, neurosurgeon and assistant professor of neurological surgery at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City, said that their patients with PD have had no issues getting insurance coverage for the treatment.

Across the pond in Netherlands, Beudel has been busy rolling out aDBS to his patients.

His team began using aDBS in routine clinical practice in 2021, initially through the ADAPT-PD trial, and has since expanded its use to roughly 20 patients this year.

He noted that patients currently require slightly more frequent hospital visits than those with cDBS, primarily for algorithm adjustments. However, in his experience, aDBS offers superior management of stimulation-induced side effects, including dysarthria, dyskinesia, and gait disturbances.

“We have the advantage that we stimulate less than with cDBS, so it's less prone for side effects. Of course, we need to be very cautious when titrating the aDBS algorithms because we need to make sure that the stimulation is switching on based on a physiological signal that correlates with the symptoms of the patient,” he told Medscape Medical News.

Given the recent rollout of this technology, Beudel stressed the importance of learning from other clinicians and establishing an international registry of centers using aDBS. So far, 26 centers across Europe, the US, and Japan have joined the consortium with the goal of sharing patient outcome data and clinical insights.

Another advantage of aDBS is its longer battery life. Because it doesn't stimulate the brain continuously, UCSF researchers found that it can conserve about 40% more power than cDBS. The battery requires monthly recharging but retains capacity for roughly 12 years — far outlasting most cell phones.

However, there are still key aspects of aDBS that experts believe need further refinement. “The main limitation right now is that it's limited to a single predefined biomarker primarily focused on beta power,” Youngerman, who also reported beneficial outcomes from aDBS among his 25 patients, told Medscape Medical News.

The current commercial device remains first generation, but future iterations are expected to incorporate more sophisticated algorithms capable of interpreting additional neural signals as scientific understanding advances, said Bronte-Stewart.

aDBS is also being explored as a potential treatment for other neurologic disorders and certain psychiatric conditions.

The next step for aDBS is greater integration of artificial intelligence (AI), which could make the system more autonomous and reduce hospital visits by allowing the stimulation to self-titrate, Beudel said.

Remote monitoring tools are also in development, potentially allowing clinicians to access a patient's aDBS data remotely and further reduce the need for clinic visits. Postmarket studies are planned, and early registries are being established, though results will likely take a year or more to emerge, Okun noted.

“The next-generation systems with AI-driven algorithms and better user interfaces are on the horizon. I'm excited. However, we must simplify programming and ensure broader access to make it a true game changer for Parkinson's care,” he said.

But for now, aDBS appears to be making a meaningful difference for patients with PD in the US and abroad. Gostkowski's patient Rand described the therapy as “a life-changing procedure that allows you to become your own self again.”

Youngerman and Gostkowski reported having no relevant financial disclosures. Beudel reported receiving research funding from the Amsterdam UMC TKI-PPP grant (2021 and 2023 call), the EU Joint Programme-Neurodegenerative Disease Research project (2021 call), Stichting ParkinsonFonds (2023 and 2025 call), and Medtronic (2023-2025), all paid to the institution. Bronte-Stewart and Okun reported having no relevant disclosures.

Edited by Vinod Rane, BS Pharm

 September 24, 2025  

A daily administration of candesartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, at a dose of 16 mg for 12 weeks was effective and well tolerated in preventing episodic migraine.

""Given its demonstrated efficacy, high tolerability, low toxicity, ease of administration, and affordability, candesartan should be included in migraine prevention guidelines as a first-line treatment,"" the authors wrote.

""Compared with existing treatment options, candesartan's favourable safety and tolerability profile might encourage better adherence in a condition with substantial unmet need,"" they added.

This study was led by Lise Rystad Øie, PhD, Department of Neurology, St Olav's University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway, and was published online on September 17, 2025, in The Lancet Neurology.

The 12-week treatment duration may have limited the assessment of candesartan's long-term efficacy. The eligibility criteria of two to eight attacks per month may have underrepresented individuals with high-frequency migraines, and the exclusion of those with 15 or more headache days per month limited the generalisability of the findings to populations with chronic migraine.

This study was funded by the Norwegian Research Council. Several authors reported receiving honoraria from various pharmaceutical companies.

A study shows that people with higher levels of the protein albumin in their urine are at increased risk of developing dementia. The study, led by researchers at Karolinska Institutet, is published in the scientific journal Journal of Internal Medicine.

Although age remains the biggest risk factor for developing dementia, researchers have increasingly shown that diseases in other parts of the body, such as the kidneys, can also affect the brain.In the new study, the researchers were able to show that people with higher levels of albumin in their urine, an abnormal condition known as albuminuria (see fact box), are at increased risk of developing dementia later in life.This association was strongest for vascular dementia, the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, often caused by stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, or other vascular diseases, and for mixed dementia, which combines features of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.The study included 130,000 older adults in Stockholm, all over the age of 65 and free of dementia at the start of the study. During a follow-up period of approximately four years, seven percent of the participants developed dementia.After taking into account kidney function and other factors, the researchers found that people with moderate levels of the protein albumin in their urine (30-299 mg/g) had a 25 percent higher risk of developing dementia, while those with high levels (≥300 mg/g) had a 37 percent higher risk compared to people with normal levels (<30 mg/g).Higher levels of this protein indicate kidney damage and, according to this study, may also signal a higher risk of dementia.

The kidneys and the brain may seem like very different organs, but they share an important characteristic: both depend on a delicate network of small blood vessels. When the blood vessels in the kidneys are damaged, the same process often occurs in the brain.""

Hong Xu, last author, assistant professor at the Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society at Karolinska Institutet

An important component is the blood-brain barrier, a protective layer that prevents harmful substances in the blood from entering the brain. Just as a damaged kidney filter leaks proteins into the urine, a damaged blood-brain barrier allows toxins and inflammatory molecules to the brain tissue. Over time, this increases the risk of vascular damage, inflammation, and accumulation of harmful proteins linked to dementia.""These results underscore the importance of routine screening for albuminuria as part of early dementia risk assessment, especially in patients with high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or kidney disease. Early detection of albuminuria could potentially delay or prevent the onset of dementia,"" says Hong Xu.The study was funded by the Center for Innovative Medicine Foundation (CIMED), the Swedish Research Council, the U&L Angeby Foundation, the Petrus and Augusta Hedlund Foundation, and the Åke Wiberg Foundation, among others.

In the first study of its kind, scientists show that far-UV light can cut airborne allergen levels by a quarter in just half an hour, opening the door to safer breathing spaces for millions with asthma and allergies.

Study: Far UV Exposure (UV222) Decreases Immune-Based Recognition of Common Airborne Allergens. Image credit: Nor Gal/Shutterstock.com

Airborne allergens, or aeroallergens, can cause respiratory allergies and asthma. A recent study in ACS ES&T Air examined the impact of far-ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the immunogenicity of several common aeroallergens, hoping to find a preventative intervention.

One in three Americans suffers from allergies, and these conditions cause multiple severe illnesses worldwide. Airborne allergens, often occurring as indoor aerosols, are a significant cause of such allergies. They also trigger asthma, which affects 262 million people globally, with 1,000 deaths a day.

Common aeroallergens are proteins associated with dust mites, cats and dogs, mice, rats, fungi (e.g., Aspergillus), and plants. In most cases, they trigger an immune response that causes allergic reactions, though non-proteins are sometimes involved.

Specific regions of the protein's three-dimensional structure form recognition and binding sites to which immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies attach, setting off the inflammatory-allergic cascade. These regions are termed epitopes.

Current control strategies include preventive measures, medication, and engineering adaptations. Aeroallergens are, however, unique in their ability to persist indoors for years. There are no standardized methods to detect and monitor them to understand exposure-response relationships or the effectiveness of preventive measures. As a result, researchers often rely on indirect indicators, such as mold spore or pollen counts, instead of measuring the allergens themselves. Alternatively, settled dust is tested rather than airborne dust.

Therefore, our understanding of real-world exposure is limited, as in plants that make latex gloves, laboratories that use animals, plants that produce detergent enzymes, or those that process grain. These may expose workers to aeroallergen concentrations above 10 ng/m3, an allergy-inducing threshold.

Current preventive strategies are typically too intensive to be sustainable. Practical and multipronged interventions are needed to tackle allergens in the respired air and settle dust effectively.

The current study examines the effectiveness of UV at 222 nm bandwidth (UV222) in reducing aeroallergens. Conventional ultraviolet therapy uses the 254 nm band, which is genotoxic and thus destroys microbes. However, this can damage the human eyes and skin and is not suitable for lived-in spaces without extensive protection.

Conversely, UV222 inactivates microbes. It is highly absorbed by proteins, causing photooxidation and structural damage. However, its limited penetration power makes it safer on the skin and eyes. The current study targets using far-ultraviolet light UV222 as an occupant-safe treatment to reduce aeroallergens.

The researchers developed a controlled chamber model containing 10 m3 of air. They generated airborne allergens within the chamber using those commonly linked to patient sensitization, allergy, and asthma. The chamber was set to a relative humidity of 60% since allergens derived from mold and dust mites thrive in such an environment.

The allergens used included:

Aeroallergens were introduced from either dustborne or purified sources. The aeroallergen-bearing particles in the air were then collected and measured. The particle size distribution was also checked for allergen enrichment at any fraction.  

UV222 exposure of the whole chamber was provided. Still, it was set below the threshold for skin and eye exposure, as per the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) standards. Ozone levels generated by the radiation were also monitored.

As expected, over 99% of aeroallergens in the experimental chamber were 10 µm or smaller. No single allergen was concentrated within any particle size range. Interestingly, some aeroallergens were more stable in the air than others, likely due to intramolecular interactions and interactions with the surrounding environment. Future research should examine how this stability influences the risk of inhalation.

Allergen levels at baseline were about 50-200 ng/m3 in the controls and the UV chamber, reflecting clinically observed respirable air allergen levels. UV222 irradiation significantly reduced the average aeroallergen load by 20% to 25%. Most of the reduction occurred within 30 minutes of treating the air.

Comparing all aeroallergens, dustborne allergens decreased faster, on average, than airborne ones, after UV222 treatment. The most significant reduction was seen with the birch allergen Bet v 1. The least affected was Fel d 1, from dustborne and purified sources. However, it became much more vulnerable to UV222 after stabilizing components like Tween-20 were removed from the purified airborne form.

The finding of borderline significant ozone exposure levels indicates the need for ozone monitoring during ultraviolet irradiation in confined conditions. However, the ozone generated during the experiment did not significantly reduce allergen levels.

Not only did clinically relevant reductions in aeroallergen loads occur, but they occurred within feasible time periods. Regarding allergen decrease, the reductions are comparable to those reported in long-term allergy studies, though the paper stresses that clinical outcomes were not directly tested here.

The authors interpret these results cautiously, suggesting that UV222 likely disrupts protein structure and reduces immunoassay detection of allergens, which may also reduce IgE-epitope recognition in the body, but this requires further study.

This is the first study to use common aeroallergens in a controlled setting at concentrations similar to real-world allergy-causing levels in the air. These new methods should help understand airborne allergens' movement and availability in respired air. They could thus help in framing effective interventions and preventive measures.

“These findings suggest that UV222 exposure can reduce allergen immunorecognition within respirable particles, supporting its use as an integrated strategy for indoor aeroallergen control.” Further research is required to understand how this is associated with a clinically relevant reduction in symptoms in sensitized or allergic individuals.

Natural systems such as CRISPR-associated transposons (CASTs) offer a targetable, one-step way to edit genomes. However, adapting them for biomedical applications has been challenging. To address this limitation, scientists at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital designed a screening approach to measure efficiency and specificity for thousands of CAST variants accurately. This high-throughput approach allowed the researchers to rapidly optimize promising candidate CASTs, uncovering mechanistic insights fundamental for further engineering and potential clinical use. The findings were published today in Nucleic Acid Research.

Discovered in 2017, CASTs integrate large pieces of DNA into the genome at locations defined by a given RNA sequence. They are highly specific in bacteria, their natural host, but they do not work as well in human cells. 

For this reason, corresponding author Elizabeth Kellogg, PhD, St. Jude Department of Structural Biology, is keenly interested in engineering CASTs to be more applicable to humans and other organisms. To do so requires a quick way to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of engineered CASTs. 

One major gap in understanding CASTs was not just measuring their overall activity, but also how accurately they integrate DNA at the intended locations. There simply wasn't a scalable way to characterize their specificity.""

Elizabeth Kellogg, PhD, St. Jude Department of Structural Biology

To address this gap, the researchers devised a high-throughput screen to measure the relative activity and specificity of thousands of CAST variants in a single experiment. By focusing on a single subtype - the V-K CAST, which is notably less complex than others - they were able to make slight alterations to its proteins and rapidly screen the mutants. 

""We wanted to screen a library with every possible single mutation to explore the mutational landscape of a CAST system,"" said co-first author Seong Guk Park, PhD, Department of Structural Biology. ""We didn't focus on specific regions; instead, we tested them all to find mutations that could improve activity or specificity.""

After the V-K CAST mutational screening, the researchers combined several of the most promising mutations to see if their positive effect was additive. ""With just a few mutations, activity increased fivefold,"" Kellogg said. ""We improved both specificity and activity without compromising either, which was not possible with previous strategies."" 

Kellogg will continue working to improve the CAST design. With this screen now available, she is optimistic. ""The natural system is very complicated, so we need to develop more minimal systems,"" Kellogg said. ""But this screen now enables us to be more ambitious with our protein design so that we can ultimately achieve this goal.""

The study's other first author is Jung-Un Park, University of California Berkeley and St. Jude. The study's other authors are Esteban Dodero-Rojas, John Bryant Jr., and Geetha Sankaranarayanan, St. Jude.

One day, bottles of probiotics might do more than keep you regular -- they could help prevent disease. To get there, a $2 million grant to UC Riverside will explore how gut bacteria shape human health.

Beyond your DNA and your lifestyle, your microbes play a huge role in shaping how your body reacts to illnesses and vaccines.""

Ansel Hsiao, associate professor in UCR's Department of Microbiology and Plant Pathology and principal investigator of the grant

The award from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) will support Hsiao's lab in its quest to answer questions about how gut microbes communicate with each other and with their human hosts to influence health, or lack thereof. 

Probiotics currently sold in markets can have beneficial effects on regularity and bloating. However, their effects are limited, in part because they don't last long in the gut. 

""Though commercial probiotics are regarded as safe, they do not make people resilient to disease,"" Hsiao said. ""They stick around for a day, maybe two. So, their beneficial effects rely on regular consumption.""

With a better understanding of microbes' communication and behavior, Hsiao hopes his lab will one day create the next generation of probiotics and prebiotics that strengthen the gut microbiome, improve the effectiveness of vaccines, and prevent or lessen the severity of infections.

""One thing we can improve on with changing the gut microbiome, is making positive changes that last for extended periods of time,"" Hsiao said.

Bacteria are individual cells that operate independently, but they can produce chemical signals that other cells can sense, and that might influence the behavior of another bacterial cell. This is called quorum sensing, which is the idea that you can have many individuals cooperating on a single goal. 

""It's like a company that requires a certain number of people to conduct a meeting. You have to have a quorum for the meeting to proceed,"" Hsiao said. ""Same idea with bacteria.""

When many bacteria in the same host are making enough communication molecules, the whole population of individuals can behave almost like a multi-cellular organism. Some pathogenic bacteria, like the diarrheal disease cholera, use this type of communication to coordinate their activity and optimize their interactions with the host during infection. When it's multiplied to a high enough level, cholera bacteria signal to one another that it's time to move on to a new host.

In collaboration with clinical teams in Bangladesh, Hsiao's lab is also identifying bacterial profiles that correlate with stronger or weaker vaccine responses for diseases like cholera. By sequencing the gut bacteria present when a person is vaccinated, the team is beginning to predict who naturally develops immunity and who may need additional protection.

Though the cholera research is funded separately, the work could help explain why a cholera vaccine that's 99% effective in the U.S. drops to about 50% effectiveness in parts of South Asia. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that connect gut bacteria with each other and to the host's immune responses could extend the work from cholera to other diseases as well.

To probe these links under controlled conditions, Hsiao's team uses germ-free mice. These animals are raised without any bacteria or fungi. By introducing specific microbes, researchers can connect specific microbes to specific health outcomes.

""It's a powerful setup,"" Hsiao said. ""We can see how a vaccine or disease-causing microbe performs when the gut contains only one bacterial species, or when it resembles a real human microbiome.""

Some microbial differences are shaped by family or early-life exposure, but others come down to timing. The first bacteria to colonize a person's guts can determine whether new species are welcomed or excluded, a dynamic known as the priority effect. This level of variability makes standardized medical approaches more complicated. Even a widely used probiotic strain might benefit one person but do nothing for another.

The recent NIH grant enables long-term investigations into how individualized microbial ecosystems affect health, not just in response to vaccines, but in other areas including cognition, nutrition, and diarrheal infection.

""This kind of support is not tied to one project but to the broader questions we're pursuing,"" Hsiao said. ""And the questions are urgent. If we can understand how to work with the microbiome instead of against it, we can transform public health.""

Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, part of University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, will co-lead a newly funded, multi-institutional clinical trial to evaluate whether artificial intelligence (AI) can help support radiologists in interpreting mammograms more accurately, with the goal of improving breast cancer screening and reducing unnecessary callbacks and anxiety for patients.

The study, known as the PRISM Trial (Pragmatic Randomized Trial of Artificial Intelligence for Screening Mammography), is supported by a $16 million award from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). The study will involve hundreds of thousands of mammograms interpreted at academic medical centers and breast imaging facilities in California, Florida, Massachusetts, Washington and Wisconsin. The AI support tool studied will be Transpara by ScreenPoint Medical with clinical workflow integration provided by the Aidoc aiOS platform.

As the first major randomized trial of AI in breast cancer screening in the U.S., this study represents a pivotal step. Our goal is to rigorously and objectively assess AI's impact - identifying who benefits and who may not. Radiologists remain firmly in control of all diagnostic decisions.""

Jose Net, M.D., director of breast imaging services at Sylvester, associate professor of clinical radiology at the Miller School and co-principal investigator of the study

Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer death among women in the U.S. While routine mammography screening reduces mortality through early detection, it also has drawbacks - including false positives that can lead to unnecessary testing, anxiety and costs, and missed cancers.

""While AI offers substantial promise, it also prompts critical questions,"" said Net. ""Our focus is on understanding whether AI genuinely enhances cancer detection by radiologists or simply leads to more false alarms.""

What makes PRISM different is its emphasis on patient-centered research. The trial was developed in close partnership with patient advocates, clinicians, health system leaders and policymakers.

Each participating facility will continue routine screening as usual, with no changes to the patient experience. Mammograms will be randomly assigned to be interpreted either by a radiologist on their own or with assistance from an FDA-cleared AI support tool. In all cases, a radiologist reads the exam and makes the final decision.

""A trial of this magnitude focusing on AI in breast cancer screening has never been conducted in the U.S.,"" stated Net. ""The findings will influence not only clinical practices but also insurance policies, technology integration, and patient interactions. According to Net, while there is significant optimism that AI will enhance health care, few rigorous studies have assessed its actual impact in real-world settings.

""This trial presents an opportunity to produce reliable evidence with a strong emphasis on the patient's perspective,"" he stated.

In addition to analyzing cancer detection and recall rates, the study will include focus groups and surveys to capture how patients and radiologists perceive and trust AI-assisted care.

The PRISM trial brings together seven leading academic medical centers:

Net emphasized that the goal is not to replace human expertise but to understand how AI might complement it. ""Our skilled radiologists will always have the final say. While AI can serve as a helpful assistant, it is ultimately the radiologist who is in control.""

The trial is expected to inform future policy decisions, best practices in screening, and how to most effectively integrate emerging technologies into patient care.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","BMJ pulls widely cited apple cider vinegar research","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250924/BMJ-pulls-widely-cited-apple-cider-vinegar-research.aspx","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 04:03:00 GMT","

BMJ Group has retracted research suggesting that small daily quantities of apple cider vinegar might help people who are overweight or obese to lose weight.

The small clinical trial was published in the open access journal BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health in March 2024 and its findings press released. The study findings generated widespread international attention at the time, and continue to be frequently referred to in media coverage.

The retraction was prompted by concerns raised about the quality of the work, including the approach to statistical analysis of the data; implausible statistical values; the reliability of the raw data; inadequate reporting of methods; and lack of prospective trial registration, which breaches BMJ Group's editorial policy.

Initially, concerns were raised in critiques of the study, some of which were published as letters in the journal. But after review by BMJ Group's content integrity team, the study was referred to statistical experts to evaluate its reliability. This included attempts to replicate the results and examine the authenticity of the underlying data supplied by the authors. 

It wasn't possible for the statisticians to replicate the results and multiple analytical errors were identified. There were also irregularities in the data set, and their report, which is appended to the retraction notice, concluded that the data collected from each participant would require further independent scrutiny. 

The authors said that the identified errors were honest mistakes, but they agree with the decision to retract the study.

Tempting though it is to alert readers to an ostensibly simple and apparently helpful weight loss aid, at present the results of the study are unreliable, and journalists and others should no longer reference or use the results of this study in any future reporting.""

Dr. Helen Macdonald, Publication Ethics and Content Integrity Editor, BMJ Group

She added: ""This retraction reflects our strategic and proactive approach to investigating concerns raised about the content we publish. We act where necessary in the interests of openness and the importance of correcting the scientific record.

""While we deal with allegations as swiftly as possible, it's very important that due process is followed. Investigations are often complex. This one involved detailed scrutiny of data and correspondence with researchers, institutions, and other experts, for example. Reaching a sound and fair and final decision can therefore take several months.""

Commenting on the decision to publish the study despite the lack of trial registration, Professor Martin Kohlmeier, editor in chief of BMJ Nutrition Prevention & Health, explained: ""In hindsight, this was the wrong decision to make. But the authors come from a scientific environment that is underrepresented in nutritional research and the journal aims to prioritise high quality evidence, which usually comes from clinical trials. 

""These are relatively unusual in nutritional research as they can be challenging to undertake because of the numbers of participants and time needed to obtain meaningful results.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New diagnostic methods and treatments needed to fight against Alzheimer's disease","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250924/New-diagnostic-methods-and-treatments-needed-to-fight-against-Alzheimers-disease.aspx","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 13:42:00 GMT","

The diagnosis and medical treatment of Alzheimer's disease, a condition that according to leading researchers in the field should be treated, has now advanced significantly. A series of articles in The Lancet provides both a comprehensive and thorough review of current research.

This is a clear statement, and a wake-up call for Sweden. We have reached a stage where Alzheimer's disease is no longer something you can do little about. We must now implement the new diagnostic methods and the new medicines, and change the healthcare system.”

Henrik Zetterberg, professor of neurochemistry, University of Gothenburg

The articles published early Tuesday constitute of “The Lancet Series on Alzheimer's disease"" and summarize the current state of Alzheimer's research worldwide. Henrik Zetterberg is co-author of two of the three articles.

The series describes the history of research, the major discoveries, controversies along the way, and the current consensus among the majority of scientists in the world that the pathology of the disease, with high levels of amyloid and tau proteins in the brain, is initiating the condition.

Similarly, there is a consensus that people undergoing memory assessments should be offered a finger prick so that their blood can be analyzed for biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, preferably at an early stage when memory and mental abilities still only reveal mild symptoms.

“The debate is whether the new clinical tests are adequate, and whether the new medicines have a clinically meaningful effect. The answer to these questions is yes, the tests are adequate, and the medicines are useful and should be used, as long as the risk of side effects, such as cardiovascular disease, is properly managed,” says Henrik Zetterberg.

The EU has approved the medicinal products lecanemab and donanemab, which slow the progression of mild dementia in Alzheimer's disease by removing amyloid plaques in the brain. Since the approval, different countries in the EU have progressed to different degrees. Swedish healthcare is waiting for regulatory approval before the medicines can start being used.

Meanwhile, more and more blood samples for Alzheimer's testing are being taken during basic memory assessments in Swedish primary care, as a complement to cognitive tests and assessments of physical and mental health, including interventions to rule out, for example, stress, depression or brain tumor.

In Henrik Zetterberg's research and laboratory environment at Sahlgrenska University Hospital Mölndal, the influx of Alzheimer's blood tests for analysis has increased in number in recent months alone:

“Every week we run perhaps 40-50 samples, primarily from Sweden and from different parts of the country, and I expect that to increase significantly this fall,” he says.

This does not concern screening, Zetterberg emphasizes, but routine care for patients who seek help because they sense that their memory and mental abilities are failing. One of his Lancet articles describes the development within Alzheimer's diagnosis as a revolution.

“It is great that we have it implemented in Sweden; we are at the clinical cutting edge. The fact that we do not yet have the medicines available is annoying and ethically problematic to say the least. The Lancet articles take a stand, stating that we now have something that actually looks good, and we can put the discussion about the benefits behind us,” concludes Henrik Zetterberg.

Researchers from USC and Duke report that the persistent ""know-do gap"" - where clinicians know guidelines but practice differently - is the primary driver of antibiotic overprescribing for pediatric diarrhea in India's private sector, not lack of knowledge, point-of-sale profits, or stockouts of clinically recommended treatments such as oral rehydration salts (ORS).

In a sample of 2,282 private providers across 253 towns, 70 percent prescribed antibiotics without signs of bacterial infection, and among those who knew antibiotics were inappropriate, 62 percent still prescribed them to standardized patients, indicating a large know-do gap. The study found that eliminating the knowledge gap alone would cut inappropriate antibiotic use by about 6 percentage points, whereas closing the know-do gap could reduce it by roughly 30 percentage points.

Randomized experiments showed that the know-do gap was driven by providers' beliefs about patient preferences and not profits from selling antibiotics or limited supplies of ORS. When patients expressed a preference for ORS, inappropriate antibiotic use fell by 17 percentage points on average, with especially large reductions among pharmacies. By contrast, removing point-of-sale financial incentives and supplying ORS had no meaningful effect on antibiotic prescribing.

A discrete choice experiment with 1,189 caregivers further found that patients did not prefer providers who give antibiotics over those who provide ORS, underscoring the misalignment between provider perceptions and actual patient preferences.

Our data reveal a striking disconnect: clinicians know antibiotics are wrong for most diarrhea cases, yet prescribe them anyway because they think parents expect 'strong' medicines. Correcting that perception, rather than another training seminar, offers the biggest win for global antibiotic stewardship.""

Zachary Wagner, corresponding author of USC's Center for Economic and Social Research

""A lot of children are given antibiotics when they don't need them, and that can lead to drug-resistant bacteria - a problem for the whole world, not just India. By showing that patient–provider communication trumps financial motives, we give policymakers a laser-focused lever: help doctors understand real patient preferences,"" added coauthor Neeraj Sood of the USC Schaeffer Center and Price School.

The authors note the largest know-do gaps among less formally trained providers and pharmacies, where preference signaling by patients yielded the biggest improvements, suggesting targeted interventions could deliver outsized benefits.

""Pharmacies and informal providers, often the first stop for care, showed the largest know-do gaps,"" noted Manoj Mohanan of Duke University. ""Interventions that empower caregivers to voice a preference for ORS, or public campaigns signaling that parents don't demand antibiotics, could slash misuse at scale.""

Funding for this research was provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (PI Wagner; 5R01DK126049).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New recommendations aim to identify children with familial hypercholesterolemia","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250923/New-recommendations-aim-to-identify-children-with-familial-hypercholesterolemia.aspx","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 02:59:00 GMT","

The Family Heart Foundation, a leading research and advocacy organization, announced the online publication of recommendations from a multidisciplinary panel in the Journal of Pediatrics to promote the early identification of children living with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). A common life-threatening genetic condition that causes high cholesterol from birth, FH can lead to premature heart attacks and heart disease, if it is not diagnosed until adulthood. Despite national guidelines established in 2011 by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the prevalence of pediatric universal lipid screening remains low, leaving the majority of affected children in the United States at high risk of heart disease decades earlier than those who have not inherited the condition.

The manuscript, titled ""Accelerating Guideline Recommended Universal Pediatric Lipid Screening: Launch of the LEAD Pediatric Initiative,"" highlights strategies that could lead to improved universal guideline-recommended screening implementation. The Family Heart Foundation established the Leveraging Evidence and Data (LEAD) for Pediatric Cholesterol Screening Initiative last year to address current challenges that serve as friction points in providing life-saving screening. The Family Heart Foundation engaged national experts and leveraged feedback from the FH population in the U.S. to identify barriers and develop evidence-based recommendations to improve universal lipid screening outcomes from the perspectives of patients/families, clinicians, and healthcare systems.

Every child in America between the ages of 9 and 11 years of age should get a simple blood test to screen their LDL cholesterol for a serious genetic condition called familial hypercholesterolemia. Many times, families do not understand that the cardiovascular disease that runs through their family for generations can be managed with early diagnosis. The publication in the Journal of Pediatrics lays out concrete actions that can be taken, and on which we have formed partnerships to support families and improve care for children.""

Katherine Wilemon, founder and chief executive officer of the Family Heart Foundation

Data published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and in Pediatrics, indicates that only 11% of youth in the U.S. between the ages of 9 and 21 had documented lipid screening, and 30 to 60% of youth with dyslipidemia may be missed by targeted screening alone compared to universal lipid screening.

""Many clinicians do not understand the reason for pediatric lipid screening guidelines that were primarily developed to identify FH, a genetic condition designated by the World Health Organization in 1998 as a public health concern,"" said Laurence S. Sperling, MD, FACC, FACP, FAHA, MASPC, chief medical officer of the Family Heart Foundation, Katz professor in Preventive Cardiology at Emory University School of Medicine, and professor of Global Health at Rollins School of Public Health. ""Early and aggressive cardiovascular disease can be prevented with an FH diagnosis in a child, leading to immediate and appropriate treatment. The goal of LEAD is to significantly impact missed opportunities to save hundreds of thousands of young lives from being cut short or burdened by early cardiovascular disease. The tools created by a working group representing patient, families, clinicians, and health systems as part of the Family Heart Foundation's LEAD initiative and outlined in the Journal of Pediatrics will increase understanding among clinicians and parents about the importance of universal screening.""

The journal publication was simultaneously highlighted at the annual Family Heart Foundation Global Summit in Atlanta, in which the findings were shared with medical experts, policy makers, and industry leaders from around the world.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New app can help young adults with first-episode psychosis to better manage cannabis use","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250924/New-app-can-help-young-adults-with-first-episode-psychosis-to-better-manage-cannabis-use.aspx","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 14:23:00 GMT","

Scientists at Université de Montréal's affiliated hospital research centre (CRCHUM) are testing out a mobile application to help young adults who have a first episode of psychosis to support safer cannabis consumption.

The nationwide clinical trial, a first in Canada, is led by Université de Montréal psychiatry and addictology professor Didier Jutras-Aswad, a researcher at CRCHUM.

Called CHAMPS (Cannabis Harm-reducing App to Manage Practices Safely), the pilot study is described in an article published in the August issue of Psychiatry Research.

The new study is backed by $800,000 in funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), specifically to evaluate the efficacy of the app.

Built in collaboration with young adults, clinicians and a number of experts, our app includes interactive modules and personalized support to reduce risks associated with cannabis consumption.""

Didier Jutras-Aswad, head of the CHUM's Department of Psychiatry

""Our pilot study confirmed its acceptability among youth having experienced a first psychotic episode,"" he said. ""The funding from the CIHR will allow us to further document the app's uses in diverse clinical contexts.""

The pilot study was conducted with the support of a multidisciplinary team that included Stephanie Coronado-Montoya, the study's first author and former PhD student of Jutras-Aswad's, and Dr. Amal Abdel-Baki, a psychiatrist at CHUM, among others.

In all, 101 young adults, ranging from 18 to 35 years old, were monitored in six specialized early-intervention clinics for psychosis in Quebec and Nova Scotia.

The goal of the project is to provide an alternative to traditional care centred on abstinence and which is often inadequate for young adults who have experienced a first episode of psychosis and who do not plan to stop their cannabis consumption.

""When comparing standard care to an approach that includes CHAMPS, we can see that the app is well regarded and that it can be integrated into real clinical environments,"" said Jutras-Aswad. 

""Even if we cannot currently draw any conclusions about CHAMPS's efficacy, we have seen an encouraging signal in terms of a decrease in cannabis-related problems,"" he said.

Now he and his researcher team aim to expand their work to include 250 young adults and six clinics throughout Quebec, Nova Scotia and Alberta. Recruitment will take place over a three-year period.

CHAMPS is more than a phone app, its proponents say: it could easily be included in existing clinical care, without increasing workloads for medical personnel.

In fact, the researchers add, it exemplifies a new approach to mental health care, one that is specifically designed to meet the actual needs of an often neglected young adult population.

""Many people don't seek to, at least for a certain period of time, reduce or cease their cannabis use,"" said Jutras-Aswad. ""But these young people are open to changing their consumption to reduce the risks to their health. This is what CHAMPS is for.""

Designed in Montreal, the app could be adopted in countries where cannabis consumption is still illegal, he added. CHAMPS joins a larger movement that is working toward humanizing, personalizing and destigmatizing cannabis use in mental health care, he said.

""It's very important that we change perceptions, practices and philosophies in order to more broadly adopt harm reduction in mental health care,"" he emphasized.

To that end, in July, he and his team published several Recommendations for Reducing the Risk of Cannabis Use-Related Adverse Psychosis Outcomes, actively promoting their approach via an international group.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Fat distribution appears to influence cancer risk","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250923/Fat-distribution-appears-to-influence-cancer-risk.aspx","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 01:13:00 GMT","

How fat is distributed in people's bodies could make a difference to their risk of certain cancers, according to new research led by the University of Bristol. The international study is published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute (JNCI) today [24 September].

Scientists have already shown that having obesity increases a person's risk of developing certain cancers. Obesity is usually measured using body mass index (BMI), but growing evidence – particularly from heart health research – suggests that BMI alone doesn't capture the full picture when it comes to obesity-related health risks. However, the role of fat distribution in cancer risk has been relatively unexplored. 

Researchers in Bristol's Integrative Cancer Epidemiology Programme (ICEP) investigated whether body fat at different locations across the body influences the risks of 12 obesity-related cancers - endometrial, ovarian, breast, colorectal, pancreas, multiple myeloma, liver, kidney (renal cell), thyroid, gallbladder, esophageal adenocarcinoma, and meningioma.

They used a technique known as Mendelian randomization, which uses statistics, computing and the natural variations in people's genetics to identify patterns in large health data sets. 

The team found that fat distribution appears to influence cancer risk – but the relationship varies by cancer type. For some cancers, where fat is stored in the body seems more important than how much is stored; for others, the reverse is true; and, for some, both matter. In cancers where distribution is important, the specific locations of body fat driving this seem to differ by cancer, meaning the overall picture is quite complex. 

Lead author, Dr. Emma Hazelwood, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Bristol, explained: ""These findings support the growing consensus that BMI, while useful for population-level trends, may be too simplistic for assessing individual health risks.

""Our results tell us that there is no 'one-size-fits-all' when it comes to cancer, meaning a more tailored approach to cancer prevention in people with obesity could be most effective."" 

The paper's findings fit with recent calls for change, including the 2024 European Association for the Study of Obesity framework and the Lancet Commission on the future of obesity, which have emphasised that BMI is a flawed diagnostic tool and that fat distribution matters.

In the future, a better understanding of how fat distribution across the body affects cancer risk could help identify those most at risk and guide more personalised approaches to obesity treatment and cancer prevention. 

The research team recommend further work is needed, using different approaches and studying non-European populations.

Dr. Hazelwood added: ""It is vital to understand the biological mechanisms that underpin these associations – particularly how and why different fat depots affect cancer development. In the longer term, we need to explore how obesity treatments – whether lifestyle or drug-based – influence these risk pathways."" 

Our evidence-based Cancer Prevention Recommendations highlight the role of maintaining a healthy weight to reduce cancer risk. While this remains essential, growing scientific evidence shows that body composition - particularly how fat is distributed throughout the body - is also a crucial factor. 

With support from our fantastic donors, we were able to co-fund the University of Bristol's excellent team whose findings will help direct this exciting area towards possible new cancer prevention and treatments."" 

Dr. Julia Panina, Head of Research Funding at World Cancer Research Fund

This study was funded by the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF UK) and Cancer Research UK (Integrative Cancer Epidemiology Programme). This work was carried out at the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit (MRC IEU), which is supported by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the University of Bristol.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, or CCHFV, is a biosafety level 4 pathogen and a Category A bioterrorism agent, causing severe viral hemorrhagic fever with mortality rates reaching up to 40%. Already endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and much of Asia, the virus has recently expanded to Western Europe, carried by ticks on migratory birds. There is currently no approved vaccine or specific antiviral therapy for CCHFV.

Scott Pegan, a professor of biomedical sciences at the University of California, Riverside School of Medicine, has now been awarded a grant from the National Institutes of Health of about $3.4 million over five years to lead an international study focused on developing protective antibodies against CCHFV.

Designated a priority pathogen by the World Health Organization and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, CCHFV is considered the reference virus for the nairovirus genus, which includes emerging pathogens such as Benji, Songling, Wetland, Yezo, and the Pacific Coast tick nairovirus.

""The rapid geographic spread and severity of CCHFV infections call for urgent, coordinated research efforts,"" said Pegan, the principal investigator on the multi-institutional project that began this month. ""This project will identify broadly protective antibody candidates that can be developed into potential therapies.""

The research brings together an interdisciplinary and international team to tackle one of the world's most dangerous emerging viral threats. The team includes co-principal investigator Dr. Mohammad Sajadi, a professor of medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine; and co-investigators Aura Garrison and Joseph Golden, who are research microbiologists at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, a long-time leader in hemorrhagic fever virus research.

The project will study survivors of CCHFV in Kazakhstan, Turkey, and Uganda to find antibodies that protect against the virus. The team will also explore how the immune system fights the virus and work to develop monoclonal antibody treatments that are effective against different strains for future testing. A monoclonal antibody is a type of lab-made protein that mimics the immune system's ability to fight harmful viruses or bacteria.

New research presented at the 41st Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS 2025) demonstrates that ocrelizumab provides superior control of multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses compared with fingolimod, natalizumab, and alemtuzumab.

Ocrelizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20+ B cells, was evaluated using real-world data from three large MS registries: MSBase, OFSEP, and the Danish MS Registry. The analysis compared ocrelizumab-treated patients with cohorts receiving fingolimod (2,600 vs. 4,103 patients), natalizumab (3,197 vs. 2,437 patients), and alemtuzumab (2,960 vs. 644 patients), all with at least six months of treatment and follow-up.

In the fingolimod comparison, MS relapse rates were significantly lower with ocrelizumab (0.06 vs 0.14; p<0.001). Fingolimod patients had a more than twice the risk of relapse (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.98–2.58), a higher risk of relapse-associated worsening, and a lower likelihood of disability improvement.

Compared with natalizumab and alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab also showed lower relapse rates (0.07 vs 0.10 and 0.12 vs 0.18, respectively; both p<0.001). Additionally, ocrelizumab reduced the risk of relapse-associated worsening compared with natalizumab, while no such difference was observed compared with alemtuzumab.

While the differences between ocrelizumab and natalizumab or alemtuzumab were statistically significant, they were modest. For example, there was approximately one fewer relapse per 33 patient-years when comparing natalizumab to ocrelizumab. These differences were most pronounced in patients with recent disease activity, prior treatment failure, or those not treatment naïve.""

Dr. Izanne Roos, lead author of the study

Adverse event data were not consistently available across registries. As a proxy for tolerability, the study examined treatment persistence. Only 8% of natalizumab patients and 6% of ocrelizumab patients discontinued treatment due to poor tolerability, suggesting both therapies are generally well-tolerated.

While ocrelizumab consistently reduced relapses and relapse-associated worsening, there was no evidence of differences in progression independent of relapse activity or disability improvement compared with the other high-efficacy therapies.

""These findings suggest we may have reached the ceiling of disability benefit achievable via relapse suppression alone, highlighting the urgent need for treatments that target relapse-independent progression,"" Dr. Roos concluded.

The trillions of microbes that live in the human gut may play a bigger role in health than previously thought, according to a new research by the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. The article, published in September 2025 in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, explores how gut bacteria interact with human genes in ways that could shape disease risk, aging and even future medical treatments.

The review highlights how the gut microbiome (the collection of bacteria, viruses and fungi that live in the digestive system) can affect epigenetics, the process that turns genes on or off without changing the DNA itself. These changes happen through chemical tags such as DNA or RNA methylation, which control when and how genes are expressed.

By understanding how gut microbes influence our genes, we can begin to imagine new ways to prevent disease and promote health in a way that gets us closer to personalized medicine.""

Alika K. Maunakea, co-author of the study and professor, UH Mānoa John A. Burns School of Medicine

Everyday factors-such as diet, stress, medications and aging-can influence these microbial interactions. For example, gut bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids, nutrients and other chemical signals that may reprogram gene activity linked to immunity, metabolism or brain health. In turn, a person's lifestyle and genetic makeup can shape which microbes thrive in the gut, creating a feedback loop between humans and their microbes.

The researchers point to future possibilities where understanding this loop could help doctors design personalized treatments. Potential applications include using microbial biomarkers (biological signals that indicate health or disease), developing ""live biotherapeutics"" (beneficial bacteria given like medicine) or refining fecal microbiota transplants, which transfer gut microbes from healthy donors to patients. Advances in artificial intelligence and single-cell analysis are helping scientists model these complex relationships at an unprecedented scale.

The paper also stresses the importance of setting clear standards and ethical safeguards as this field develops. Frameworks such as the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable data) and CARE principles (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility and Ethics) are needed to ensure that data from microbiome research benefits diverse populations equitably.

By mapping out how gut microbes communicate with human genes, the review underscores both the promise and responsibility of this emerging science. The insights could open the door to precision health strategies that tailor prevention and treatment to each individual's unique microbial and epigenetic makeup.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Scientists study how nanoplastics transfer across generations","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250923/Scientists-study-how-nanoplastics-transfer-across-generations.aspx","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 02:55:00 GMT","

You can't see nanoplastics with the naked eye, but they're everywhere - including your body.

Tinier than the better-known microplastics, these plastic particles range from one nanometer to one micrometer in size; a human hair, by comparison, is about 100 micrometers thick.

Nanoplastics are present in drinking water, food and the air, and have been detected in both tap water and bottled water. They are widely detected in the environment.""

Huiyuan Guo, Assistant Professor of Chemistry, Binghamton University

Guo and Associate Professor of Biological Sciences Anthony Fiumera recently received a $500,000 grant from the National Science Foundation to investigate how nanoplastics pass from mothers to their offspring. The interdisciplinary project will create special trackable versions of these particles to see exactly how they move through organisms and understand why they cause harm that can last for generations.

The researchers will use Daphnia magna, a tiny species of freshwater crustacean commonly called water fleas, as the animal model. Daphnia, which have transparent bodies, reproduce quickly and are sensitive to environmental stress; they are often used as an indicator species in environmental toxicity testing, Fiumera explained.

""They're actually a great model to study transgenerational or epigenetic inheritance,"" he added. ""They're also surprisingly similar to humans in the way in which that works.""

Research has already demonstrated that nanoplastics can affect aquatic species such as daphnia, affecting their survival and reproductive capacities; other research has investigated potential toxicity on a molecular level. However, this research typically focuses on a single generation or short-term effects of toxicity, Guo said.

Water fleas are close to the bottom of the food chain, feeding on small particles such as algae. In turn, daphnia are food for fish and other animals; what affects them can thus end up affecting other species in an ecosystem's food chain.

A mother daphnia may directly transmit the tiny plastic particles to her offspring. In fact, Guo's lab has already published research on how nanoplastics can transfer from a daphnia's intestines to other body parts; from there, they will explore how these tiny particles may breach the biological barrier between mother and offspring.

First, however, researchers need to detect the tiny particles, a difficult feat.

""That's why our first objective is to develop a detectable nanoplastic model,"" Guo said. ""We can use it to better understand how they transfer from one generation to another.""

They will use two approaches to detect the nanoplastics in daphnia: confocal surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

They will also consider how nanoparticles affect gene expression in the mother, her offspring and subsequent generations.

""It's possible that these particles are being physically transferred, but it's also possible that changes in gene expression are being inherited in addition to the actual nanoparticles,"" Fiumera said. ""That's one of the things we're trying to figure out: How important is the actual particle transfer versus the transfer of these epigenetic effects?""

While the grant lasts for three years, Guo and Fiumera plan to continue their work long into the future, looking at different animal models and addressing additional questions.

Here's one. Plastics have traditionally been petroleum-based; however, recent years have seen the development and adoption of bioplastics, made from renewable biomass sources, as an eco-friendly alternative. How might the shift to bioplastics affect the environment over the long term?

""Some of these plastics are considered biodegradable. However, this biodegradability also means they are more likely to become smaller particles like nanoplastics,"" Guo said. ""How do you know which one is safer?""

To answer that question, the researchers will compare the different types of nanoplastics to see which are more toxic and which are more easily transmitted to future generations.

Future generations are also a focus in a different way: A community outreach component seeks to foster the next generation of scientists, in collaboration with the New York State Master Teacher Program and the Go Green Institute, which provides an intensive, 10-day hands-on learning experience for middle- and high-school students.

Some high school and first-year University lab classes already study daphnia, Guo said. The researchers propose to integrate their project into an undergraduate research course at the University and pilot-test related scientific kits through the Go Green Institute summer camp. These kits can then be distributed to K-12 schools and the local community to conduct their own research into the environmental impact of plastic.

""It's a pipeline to give an authentic research experience to as many students as we can,"" Fiumera said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Expanding education boosts lifestyle medicine adoption across health systems","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250923/Expanding-education-boosts-lifestyle-medicine-adoption-across-health-systems.aspx","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 02:50:00 GMT","

Expanding access to lifestyle medicine education opportunities-such as continuing medical education (CME) courses, professional certification, webinars, mentoring and peer-to-peer connections, and conference participation-can facilitate the adoption of the medical specialty across health systems, according to a new study published in Translational Behavioral Medicine.

This qualitative study conducted by the American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) found that intentional educational strategies are critical to the adoption and growth of lifestyle medicine programming and facilitate deepening of clinicians' knowledge, skills, and confidence in delivering lifestyle medicine interventions to treat, reverse and prevent chronic disease.

These findings give health system leaders a roadmap of educational strategies to advance lifestyle medicine implementation. By investing in CME courses and conferences or creating space for informal activities like wellness programs and peer support, leaders have powerful levers that drive adoption and sustain long-term growth.""

Micaela Karlsen, PhD, ACLM Senior Director of Research 

To understand how health systems prepare clinicians to practice lifestyle medicine, researchers conducted more than 60 interviews with clinicians, administrators and educators at eight health systems. Seven of these health systems are part of ACLM's Health System Council-a collaborative network dedicated to accelerating clinical integration of the specialty.

Interviewees identified several educational strategies that supported lifestyle medicine practice, including:

Interviewees described how educational initiatives translated into cultural and practice shifts within their organizations, also leading to mentoring and further peer support. The role of cultural support had been further explored in a previous ACLM study. One physician in the new study responded that after they earned lifestyle medicine certification, they ""helped 15 other people, a few physicians and nurse practitioners"" get board certified."" At least two health systems established resources to support employees to achieve certification. 

Six health systems described leveraging lifestyle medicine and food as medicine conference attendance to support clinician education. Interviewees noted that the experience not only instilled a passion for lifestyle medicine but also inspired them to disseminate knowledge and insights within their organizations.

The study highlighted the benefit of embedding lifestyle medicine into employee wellness initiatives. These initiatives gave clinicians firsthand experience with the same lifestyle interventions recommended for patients, reinforcing both their confidence and credibility when delivering lifestyle medicine care. While pilot programs have long been recognized as an approach to test the feasibility of an intervention, the study's first author Meghan Ames, DrPH, MSPH, RDN, said ""This work highlights that delivering lifestyle medicine to health system employees can serve as a rich opportunity for healthcare professionals to learn firsthand what lifestyle medicine is and how powerful it can be to impact health.""

The study also pinpointed key educational content areas considered most critical: a clear definition and evidence base for lifestyle medicine, behavior change counseling, familiarity with lifestyle medicine referral opportunities and business operation skills.

Many of the strategies interviewees described focused on raising awareness of the lifestyle medicine resources available both inside and outside their health systems. This awareness was seen as critical for making patient referrals and ensuring consistent use of lifestyle medicine services. As one physician explained, ""It's also important that the people you work with know about what existing resources are,"" adding that education must be continuous because ""you'll always have new staff or new physicians joining.""

Q2 Stadium opened its doors less than five years ago, and in a short time it's quickly become a special place for the U.S. Men's National Team. The USMNT is undefeated in Austin, Texas through six games — all of them shutouts. 

The National Team competes in venues across the world, but Austin is one of five cities in the country where the USMNT is unbeaten after at least five games played. AT&T Stadium, up the I-35 in Arlington, Texas holds the longest streak with seven. Both were recent stops in the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup where the United States made a run to the final.

The Americans return to the home of the Austin FC on Oct. 10 to face World Cup-qualified Ecuador at 8:30 p.m. ET in the build-up to the 2026 FIFA tournament next summer. This will be the second friendly, while the other five matches have been tournament games, including the Concacaf Gold Cup and Nations League as well as FIFA World Cup Qualifiers. The first friendly was head coach Mauricio Pochettino's first game — and win — in October 2024. 

It wasn't too long ago when the USMNT last took the field in the Texas capital. The USA took down Saudi Arabia 1-0 in a group stage match of the Gold Cup this past June. Defender Chris Richards earned Man of the Match honors as he scored his second international goal and made a key tackle to prevent a Saudi Arabia potential scoring opportunity. 

The six matches at Q2 have been electric. Three of the outings have been sellouts with a total average attendance of more than 18,000. The USMNT has given fans a lot to cheer for in Austin with 14 goals scored and none allowed. 

Striker Ricardo Pepi and forward Jesús Ferreira have accounted for eight of those goals, scoring four each. The forwards have deep ties to Texas as Pepi grew up in El Paso and Ferreira spent formative years in Dallas, and both came up through the FC Dallas Academy. Ferreira totaled that amount in one match in June 2022 against Grenada in the Nations League opener. The impressive four-goal match tied a USMNT record that only five players have touched. 

The United States will look to continue that winning legacy and go 7-0 in Austin. A victory over Ecuador would extend its win streak versus the CONMEBOL side to four, which would be the longest current streak against a South American opponent.","{'href': 'https://www.ussoccer.com', 'title': 'US Soccer'}","soccer"

Alex Morgan is honored and has her No. 13 jersey retired by San Diego. (0:33)

DEL MAR, Calif. -- One year ago, after Alex Morgan announced to the world in a video that she was pregnant and retiring with almost immediate effect, she sat in her car alone and cried.

""I was like OK, it's out there. Now I'm going to enjoy it,"" she told ESPN in a sit-down interview.

Morgan's 15-year career -- which included two World Cup titles, an Olympic gold medal and multiple major club trophies -- ended abruptly, but she'd already been working for years on her next chapter to come in the world of business.

Morgan was the face of the U.S. women's national team and arguably the most famous female athlete globally for over a decade. She grew to such fame that she transcended the sport, signing deals with Coca-Cola and Nike, appearing in commercials with NBA star LeBron James and even receiving her own custom Barbie. Along the way, she observed how the business of sports operates, but also how it failed female athletes with minimal media coverage and low salaries ($6,000 was the minimum when the NWSL launched in 2013).

Now, Morgan is a minority investor in San Diego Wave FC, the last team she played for, along with other investments including the new 3-on-3 women's basketball league, Unrivaled. In 2019, in the prime of her career, she co-founded the content brand Togethxr with fellow athletes and Olympic gold medalists Sue Bird, Simone Manuel and Chloe Kim.

""I just realized that there are so many ways for athletes to carry on their business far past their playing career and to make a business of it, of their brand, far past their playing days,"" Morgan said. ""That's what I've tried to set up the last five to eight years.

""And I think that's why I was so at peace with retiring from playing soccer, because I didn't retire and wake up the next day going, 'What's next?' I already had so many different things in motion -- it wasn't like figuring the next thing out as one door closed and the next door opened. I was juggling a lot of things at once and trying to learn a lot of new things off the field.""

Morgan's hands-on experience at the highest level of sport is why other businesswomen have invested in her. Olivia Walton, the founder of Ingeborg Investments -- which focuses on women-led, early-stage startups -- met Morgan at a conference for women in venture capital. The two shared a vision ""from the beginning,"" said Walton, who joined Togethxr as an investor earlier this year.

Morgan's achievements as a player were part of the selling point to Walton.

""Alex approaches business the same way she approaches competition -- with curiosity, intensity, and purpose,"" Walton told ESPN via email. ""She sees opportunities others miss because she's lived the athlete's journey, and she brings an authenticity that's rare in this space.""

Togethxr's primary business is branded studio content, including films focused on women athletes. The company said it was profitable last year and claimed it saw a large increase in revenue (to $30 million) and valuation.

""That 360-degree perspective is unmatched, and it makes her one of the most important voices shaping the future of the game,"" Walton said. ""Few people can walk into a room and be listened to equally by players, sponsors, and investors like Alex can.""

That is high praise for someone whose business experience has been, by Morgan's own admission, learning as she goes. Morgan studied political economics at Cal-Berkeley, but she was becoming a household name with the USWNT before she even graduated college -- where she ""was very head down, driven to be the best soccer player I could possibly be.""

Alex Morgan reacts to her first goal for the USWNT in a friendly vs. China.

These days, Morgan is busy beyond Togethxr. For one, she is now a mom of two, telling ESPN that she tries to find balance in simple ways like stepping out to take a walk.

Through Trybe Ventures, the investment arm she has with her husband, Servando Carrasco, she also has a stake in roughly two dozen companies ranging from media to sports technology. Among their other investments are the Los Angeles Golf Club in TGL, and Classic Football Shirts, a company focused on nostalgic soccer kits.

Dan Levy, who has been Morgan's agent since she first became a professional soccer player, said it's rare to find an athlete who can successfully navigate business ventures in the prime of their career.

""A lot of athletes struggle with trying to figure out how to manage their career and be the best at what they do on the field, on the court, and at the same time, put in the time, effort, and work to build their business outside of it,"" he told Variety recently.

Today, Morgan leans on those athlete experiences -- and the expertise of partners like Walton -- to sharpen herself as a businessperson.

""I'm learning in this new space every single day,"" Morgan said. ""It's very humbling and it's also really challenging in a lot of ways -- in a good way, in the way that I was challenged on the soccer field every day. I feel like I rely on a lot of the skills that I learned in soccer, a lot of the personal character-building skills that I can apply to business.""

Morgan made a quick transition from player to team owner for the Wave, retiring last September and joining the team as an investor in May.

Alex Morgan says never in her ""wildest dreams"" would she see San Diego Wave retire her. No. 13 jersey.

Last year, amid turmoil for the Wave on and off the field that included allegations from former employees of a toxic work environment, Morgan prominently spoke as an active player, tweeting ""it is clear that there is so much work to be done."" Since then, the team has fully transitioned ownership to the Levine Leichtman family and turned over its front office, including the December departure of former team president Jill Ellis, who along with the club denied allegations made by previous employees. (Ellis filed a defamation lawsuit, while the employees are suing the Wave and the NWSL.)

Asked what has changed with the club in just over a year and why she invested, Morgan said that one of the reasons she wanted to invest is to provide feedback from the perspective of a former player. She said she wants to provide mentorship to young players, several of whom on the Wave are teenagers. Twenty-four-year-old defender Kennedy Wesley said after the Wave retired Morgan's No. 13 jersey on Sept. 7 that she grew up with a poster of Morgan on her wall.

Morgan was more than just a great player who scored 123 international goals. She was a central figure in the USWNT's fight against the U.S. Soccer Federation for equal pay, which it achieved via settlement in 2022 after a six-year fight. She was also an active participant in the NWSL's collective bargaining negotiations, and one of the prominent voices in the fight against the NWSL's previous inaction against abuses.

Her public statements contributed to the firing of Paul Riley from the North Carolina Courage for alleged previous sexual misconduct with players, and to the ousting of former NWSL commissioner Lisa Baird for her handling of the complaints.

Morgan said the NWSL has significantly improved from ""the leanest years"" when it launched with her as a player in 2013, and from the league's recent overhaul following what multiple investigations revealed as ""systemic"" abuse.

Players have obtained more agency and workplace protection through the new CBA. One specific new policy Morgan pointed to is the ability to take paid mental health leave, as multiple players in the NWSL have done this year.

""That just didn't exist a couple of years ago,"" Morgan said. ""I attempted to do that with the national team and then I was not called back in for six or seven months because of it, because of raising my hand and saying I need a break, I just had a baby, and I need to step away for this next camp. And then I wasn't invited back for six or seven months.

""Players now can do that without repercussion. Everyone needs a break at some point or another, whether it's in their second year or 15th year playing soccer, playing sports, in their job. The ability to be able to do that is something that's new and I feel like I've advocated for players to be able to be able to be the driving force of this league.

""There is no league without players, so let's treat them right, let's give them all the resources we could possibly do like with financial literacy, with mental stability, with family planning, whatever it may be. I have fought for those things both as a player and now as an owner.""

Morgan has long known she has a large platform. Her voice has directly driven change in the NWSL and U.S. Soccer, and that hands-on approach remains. ""She's not just lending her name -- she's in the meetings, driving ideas forward, and shaping the vision,"" Walton said. ""That level of commitment is rare.""

Morgan's commitment to growth is embodied by the slogan made famous by Togethxr: ""Everyone Watches Women's Sports."" It's a campaign increasingly plastered across apparel, but it's also statistically backed (even if slightly exaggerated) by rising media deals, attendance, and valuations across women's sports. Women's sports have become big business.

NWSL teams have increased from $2 million sales five years ago to a $250 million sale of Angel City FC last year. Transfer fees crossed the $1 million mark for the first time in January and the world record fell on multiple occasions since as teams invest more in players.

Morgan teased another forthcoming investment in women's sports ""soon"" when she spoke with ESPN. This is her new life, one that traded her boots for the boardroom and her foundation for equity in sports.

Morgan is learning day to day on the fly, but she knows one thing firsthand: ""Listen, anyone who's smart is getting into investing in women's sports.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Women's Soccer

The Black Women's Player Collective (BWPC) will cohost a showcase in November aimed at identifying and nurturing young Black soccer talent, the organization announced Wednesday.

In partnership with Allstate and Black Star media, the Next Wave National Showcase will take place on the campus of Prairie View A&M, an historically Black college in Texas, from Nov. 22-25. Allstate provided the funding for the event, and Black Star will serve as the chief storyteller. The group will select 20-30 of the best Black high school soccer players in the country.

Between the elimination of the college draft and increased visibility of Black female soccer players succeeding at all levels of the game, the ability to properly scout and develop Black talent has become more critical. According to BWPC data, 3.8 per cent of NWSL players self-identified as Black during the 2020 season. That figure has since grown to 12 per cent for the 2025 season, while Black players make up nearly half of the U.S. women's national team.

“Black players have been historically underrepresented in this sport, and if you don't carve out space for us to exist in this community, then they'll be left behind,” North Carolina Courage forward Brianna Pinto, who serves on the board of the BWPC, told The Athletic before the announcement.

“It's incredibly important to the BWPC to make sure that we're creating a seat at the table for the next generation of Black athletes, and the way to do that is by making events specifically for them.”

The announcement comes one week after the NWSL announced it would host two combines for different age groups in December. One will be for players aged 13-17; the other for those 18-23, with an aim “to support NWSL clubs in early talent evaluation and provide players with exposure to a professional environment,” according to NWSL Director of Youth Development Karla Thompson.

Like the NWSL combine, the organizers of the Next Wave Showcase are yet to share their list of participating players. Pinto supports the expansion of opportunities for young players to show their skills in front of clubs, coaches, and agents, but emphasized the importance of showcasing Black talent.

“In this country, in a lot of social environments, Black people have been an afterthought and we want to celebrate our collective experience as minorities in this country because we have so much to share and so much to give and so much passion for the game,” she said. “I do believe that if we pour into our community, it will benefit the entire soccer landscape.”

Pinto said BWPC members will tap into their respective networks to nail down their invite list for the showcase. The itinerary will include “a lot of playing so that they can properly be evaluated,” Pinto said, adding the event would aim to “identify talent and push them to where they need to be.”

The BWPC and its partners were intentional about taking a holistic approach to the showcase, ensuring its messaging was aligned with its sporting ambitions. There will also be networking opportunities with coaches, scouts, and agents; and a media day for the players to gain experience interacting with the press.

Pinto said one detail that's garnered excitement among the BWPC is the inclusion of hair, makeup, and “off the field glam,” as she put it, to expose players to that side of professional sports.

In 2021, U.S. women's national team star Crystal Dunn spoke about the disappointment of walking into similar environments and being unable to work with hair and makeup artists who were trained to work with Black textured hair and darker complexions.

Pinto said the showcase will discuss nutrition and mental health with the players. She also hopes that it will “shift the landscape and give more attention to HBCU athletics programs.”

The showcase comes against the backdrop of the Trump administration targeting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs by withdrawing funding from initiatives, if not eliminating policies altogether. For Pinto, these efforts to specifically champion Black people have been vital for long before that.

“We've always had to create spaces for our own people to thrive and to fully be themselves,” she said. “I think as we move forward and continue to push the boundaries as those policies continue to get more restricted, we have to be diligent about protecting our own, and I think this is a way for us to show joy in the face of adversity.

“Joy is a contagious thing because if we put on an event where people are celebrated and they feel valued and seen as a whole human being, I think that's a way of protesting, of making space for these incredible individuals who are going to make up the next generation of athletes.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Why Sue Bird chose Kara Lawson to coach the U.S. national team","https://www.sbnation.com/womens-sports/1081687/kara-lawson-sue-bird-team-usa-national-team-duke-olympics","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 12:10:00 GMT","

Kara Lawson follows in the footsteps of Pat Summitt and Mike Krzyzewski with Team USA.

DURHAM, N.C. — Kara Lawson was in the vast and sprawling Atlanta airport when she got a call from a friend and former teammate whom she affectionately calls “Birdie.”

The wider women's basketball-viewing public knows her better as Sue Bird — a five-time Olympic gold medalist, a four-time WNBA champion, the league's all-time leader in assists and games played, and an inductee this year into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.

But Bird now has another title too. Earlier this year, she was named as the U.S. women's national team managing director. That meant hiring a coach to lead the prestigious team through its next cycle — which includes the 2026 FIBA World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics — is up to her.

And that's what Bird was calling Lawson about.

The Duke coach had a feeling what the topic of conversation might be when she picked up her phone.

“I knew that they would be naming a coach soon. Did I know it would be me? No. Did I know that I was probably a candidate? Yes,” Lawson said. “It was probably not the most ideal place to get that call.”

Tuesday in Cameron Indoor Stadium was a more appropriate setting, where Bird presented Lawson with a red Team USA jersey with the No. 28 on it, officially naming her as the next head coach of the U.S. national team for women's basketball.

A video narrated by Mike Krzyzewski introduced Lawson, and the crowd was littered with basketball VIPs and those meaningful to the Duke women's head coach — from high school teammates to Tennessee great Tamika Catchings, from her mother and sisters to Boston Celtics president Brad Stevens, as well as Blue Devils athletic director Nina King and ACC commissioner Jim Phillips.

When she approached the microphone to speak to the folks assembled, Lawson had to pause for about 30 seconds. She brushed her hair aside, took a deep breath, pinched the bridge of her nose, fought back tears and collected herself. She pulled out one of the three tissues she carried in the pocket of her navy blazer.

“The game just got started and I already need a timeout,” Lawson said, drawing an empathetic laugh from the crowd. She then stoically named each of the 12 coaches that preceded her in leading Team USA, beginning with Billie Moore and finishing with Cheryl Reeve.

“It's incredible. I mean, it's the No. 1 job in our country, right? At least it is to me. I guess everyone can have their opinion,” Lawson said with a smile. “To me, to lead your country's national team is the best job there is, and to be selected for. That's a great feeling — the belief and the trust the Federation has in me, and Sue specifically, is awesome.”

The 44-year-old Lawson takes over the team — which has won eight consecutive Olympic gold medals and four straight World Cups — during a time of transition. Bird is the first person to hold the title of managing director for the squad, and she and Lawson are tasked with guiding it through a potential era of change. While in-their-prime stars like A'ja Wilson and Napheesa Collier figure to be part of the plans for 2028, longtime mainstays like Diana Taurasi have aged out of the team and other elder veterans could get squeezed out as young rising talents like Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese, Paige Bueckers and Aliyah Boston fight for spots on the roster.

And while the Americans' dominance in women's basketball has continued, the gap is narrowing as the rest of the world catches up. Remember, in the 2024 gold medal game, Team USA needed clutch plays in crunch-time from Kahleah Copper, Wilson and Breanna Stewart to beat France 67-66.

Bird, who will have the ultimate say in roster selection, believes that Lawson is up for the task of leading whatever players are on the squad to another Olympic gold.

“When I thought about the qualities that we were going to need for our head coach, I looked for someone who understood the experience of having USA on their chest. In Kara's case, it came in the form of a jersey as well as a polo,” Bird said, a nod to Lawson's tenure as both a player and coach for the national team. “Her international experience is unmatched.”

Because of her resume, coaching bonafides and connections to Team USA, Lawson has long made sense to be the next coach of the national team. For her, this appointment is the latest chapter in her long journey with Team USA, an organization she's been part of since she was a teenager.

In 1998, Lawson wore the stars-and-stripes for the first time in the World Youth Games. Since that debut, she's collected 13 gold medals in various competitions as a player and coach, including winning the Olympic gold as a player in 2008 — a tournament that saw Lawson set the Team USA record for 3-point percentage, as she shot a 57.1 percent clip from deep range in that tournament.

That U.S. team that won the gold in Beijing marked the first — and only — time that Bird and Lawson shared the court as teammates. Bird recalled first learning about Lawson by reading about her playing football in Sports Illustrated For Kids. They then battled in youth basketball, as rivals in college at Tennessee and UConn, and then in the WNBA. Bird remembers she and her youth teammates referring to Lawson simply by her hairstyle back in those days: “Who's guarding pigtails?”

But Bird also recalls being in awe watching Lawson's determination in the 2008 gold medal game, where she shot a perfect 5-of-5 from the floor and 4-of-4 from the charity stripe to lead the Americans in scoring with 15 points as they topped Australia 92-65.

“You always knew she was going to be prepared. You always knew that she was going for the jugular,” Bird said of Lawson. “She wasn't going to miss a moment. Kara was the one that stepped up, balled out… I don't think anybody on the roster was surprised by that moment, because that's who Kara is.”

After 13 seasons in the WNBA, Lawson retired from playing and embarked on a career in broadcasting, working as both a sideline reporter and color analyst for NBA and women's college games. But the passion she really wanted to chase was coaching.

The first organization to hand her a whistle was Team USA, hiring her to work with the men's and women's 3x3 teams as that variation of the sport was preparing for its Olympic debut. In 2021, Lawson coached the women's 3x3 team to a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics.

“Somebody along the line has to believe in your ability. Somebody has to give you that chance. And I might be one of the few people in history that USA Basketball was their first coaching job,” Lawson said. “They believed in me first.”

Lawson then spent a season with the Boston Celtics as an assistant under Stevens before becoming the head coach of the Blue Devils in the summer of 2020. Duke has won 70.1 percent of its games under Lawson, making the NCAA Tournament in each of the last three seasons. This past season culminated with Duke's first ACC championship and Elite Eight appearance since 2013.

With her Blue Devils in the crowd — dressed in sweatsuits akin to what their coach typically wears at practices — Lawson gave her Duke players credit for helping her get the Team USA gig.

“You are nothing without good players. You have to have good players to have the greatest success. And I told them this last week, I know I'm not standing here without these players,” Lawson said. “They don't give this job to someone that coaches a team that stinks... They had to decide that we were going to be good.”

Bird became the managing director for Team USA back in May and has been thinking about who she might hire as the team's next coach ever since.

Traditionally, most coaches who have led the national team have done so for only one Olympic cycle. The lone exception is Bird's college coach, UConn's Geno Auriemma, who guided the team to gold medals in both the 2012 games in London and the 2016 games in Rio de Janeiro.

When Bird began plotting what the ideal candidate might look like, she wanted someone who was a superb communicator, someone who understood both college and WNBA players, and someone with Team USA coaching experience. Lawson, who had just been a top assistant for Cheryl Reeve at the 2024 Olympics, checked all the boxes. And if this summer's AmeriCup was a test trial — where Lawson led a team of college players to a 7-0 record and the championship, securing a spot in next year's FIBA World Cup in Germany — she passed with flying colors.

Ironically, Bird happened to be in an airport too when she called Lawson with her decision.

“We were both in a bit of a time crunch… I've never done this before either. I wanted to enjoy it for myself, wanted to get it right for Kara,” Bird recalled. “Pretty quickly it was just, ‘Hey, if you'd like this job, it's yours,' kind of a vibe.”

On working with Bird, Lawson said, “Birdie and I have known each other since we were like 10 or 11 — a long time. She's very, very sharp. A great teammate, a big picture thinker… We're going to lean on each other a lot.”

Chairs were assembled in front of the stage at Cameron Indoor Stadium where Lawson was introduced as the national team coach for the first time. In the first row, two seats held bouquets. One was for Lawson's late father, and the other — a gold vase containing orange flowers — was for her college coach, the legendary Pat Summitt.

Lawson is, inarguably, the strongest active branch remaining on the Summitt coaching tree. The last time the Olympics were held in Los Angeles was in 1984, where Summitt coached the team to the gold medal for the first time. When the Summer Games return to the City of Angels in 2028, it'll be one of Summitt's Lady Vols guiding the team.

“She's been the most powerful influence on how I coach, how I structure my program, foundationally what I do,” Lawson said. “To be honest, I never thought I'd be in the same sentence as her, ever. How could you think that you would be with all she accomplished? And so, now, to share at least one title with her is really, really fulfilling as her player.”

Lawson added later: “I think she would always tell me to enjoy the opportunity, to be myself, and to make sure we were good on defense.”

It's not just Summitt's legacy that Lawson will carry with her as she begins her tenure as the head coach of the national team. She is also, after all, a coach at Duke. And so, Lawson also follows in the footsteps of Mike Krzyzewski, the former Blue Devils' men's coach who shepherded the American men to three Olympic gold medals.

As she accepted the jersey from Bird, she stood on a stage on “Coach K Court” under banners that his teams hung across four decades in Durham.

“That's kind of crazy. I don't think I am in the class of either of those two coaches, but I do share the same title as the U.S. national team head coach,” Lawson said. “I'm good with that.”

NWSL

Buying into the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) in 2021 was practically a bargain. Bids were judged mainly on whether the city had fans and if the ownership group was serious about running a standalone women's team. If you had $2 million to invest, it was a no-brainer to buy into the 10-team league.

The NWSL has transformed since then. Expansion fees jumped to $110 million in five years, and infrastructure is no longer a nice-to-have but a must. With soaring valuations— an average NWSL team is worth around $104 million — the pressure to build a successful team is at an all-time high.

By 2026, the NWSL will have doubled in size with Boston Legacy FC and Denver Summit FC joining as the 15th and 16th teams. Even their cover charges differ by $50 million, with Boston paying $53 million and Denver spending a record $110 million to join. And that's before the stadiums, training facilities and additional bills land.

They also had less than two years to pull it off on a truncated timeline.

“It's both a blessing and a curse,” Summit controlling owner Rob Cohen told The Athletic. Denver paid the most for its team and has the least amount of time — just 14 months — to prepare for its inaugural season.

“It's a blessing, because the deadlines and the short timeframe really force everyone to be focused on what's most important, and making sure that we get things done,” he said. “We don't have a lot of time to sit around and opine on uncertain things. On the other hand, it's a curse: it's a lot to get done in a short period of time.”

The league awarded the franchise to Cohen's investment group on Jan. 30, 2025. Just 173 days later, eight months before its 2026 debut, the club rolled out its name, crest, and colors, unveiling its brand identity. Three months after that, it surpassed 15,000 season-ticket deposits.

Not bad for a franchise with a little over a year to get off the ground.

“This was a market and a fanbase that had rallied hard to win expansion and bring a club to Denver,” Jen Millet, the club's president, told The Athletic. Millet came to Denver after helping launch fellow NWSL team, Bay FC, in 2024.

“I'd seen fan excitement before, but the landscape for women's sports has jumped another level since 2024,” she said. “In Denver, there's genuine passion: a rich pipeline of talent, a huge youth soccer scene, and a history of sold-out USWNT matches.”

Denver's solid pipeline of players is nothing short of superstars: Sophia Wilson, Lindsey Horan, Mallory Swanson and Ally Watt are all Colorado natives. The team signed the latter as its first player. Cohen said they will be announcing the roster at the start of the offseason in November. But even with talent and a built-in fanbase, forging a team in less than two years has not been easy.

Cohen's investor group includes former NFL quarterback Peyton Manning, Olympic skier Mikaela Shiffrin and Ariel Investments' Project Level, led by Mellody Hobson, among others. Crucially, grassroots advocates, including former U.S. international and Colorado-native Jordan Angeli, have played a leading role in selling Denver as a market. Once they won the bid, the priority was building a strong front office and starting early with multiple infrastructure projects, including a performance center, training fields, community fields, a temporary stadium and the permanent stadium all at the same time.

“I'll be honest, I don't think there was anything on the easy list,” Cohen said. “I think the hardest piece isn't going to surprise people, it's the infrastructure builds that need to happen in order to play a game 14 months after you're awarded a franchise.”

While construction brings its own challenges for Denver, filling seats won't be one of them. With 15,000 deposits already secured, they have surpassed the capacity of both their temporary stadium in Centennial and their future 14,500-seat home at Santa Fe Yards, slated to open in 2028.

As Cohen put it, in the NWSL's new era, nothing comes easy. When it opens, Denver's stadium will be the second purpose-built venue in league history, a milestone that underscores commissioner Jessica Berman's vision since taking the job in 2022: franchises that are strong, independent, and in control of their own homes.

This mantra has drawn a different caliber of investors in recent years who can afford the nine-digit valuations. Lauren Leichtman, co-founder of Levine Leichtman Capital Partners, paid $120 million to acquire San Diego Wave in 2024. Carolyn Tisch Blodgett, from the family behind the New York Giants, bought into Gotham FC in 2023, just before its first NWSL title. And Laura Ricketts, whose family owns the Chicago Cubs, picked up the Chicago Stars for $35.5 million that same summer. In 2024, Willow Bay and Disney CEO Bob Iger joined Angel City FC's investment group, increasing the team's valuation to $250 million.

Sitting with reporters last week at the league's headquarters, Berman made it clear she sees no ceiling. If the NFL and NHL can grow to 32 teams, she asked, why not the NWSL?

At the same time, Berman announced a rule change that could help make that happen. Instead of rigid timelines for franchise bids, the league will now move to a rolling system, giving potential owners the chance to jump in when they're ready. With more than a dozen groups already in the mix, Berman said the shift should give bidders room to recruit, secure infrastructure investment, and set themselves up for a stronger launch.

That flexibility would have been useful for Boston Legacy, which had two and a half years to prepare for its debut. That's plenty of time on paper, but short when you add in an infrastructure battle.

Like Denver's, Boston's bid hinged on infrastructure. Rather than building a new venue, the group chose to renovate White Stadium in Franklin Park, a publicly owned facility in the heart of the city where the Legacy will play its home games starting in 2027. A group of residents pushed back against the project, citing concerns about accessibility and community use. In April, a Superior Court Justice ruled the renovations, which had been held up in court, were not a violation of the law and could continue.

“It's going to allow us to achieve our vision, which is our commitment to creating a top-tier facility for our players,” Boston's controlling owner, Jennifer Epstein, said of the stadium project. “So many women's teams are treated as the baby sister of a men's club, sharing stadiums that reflect someone else's brand. This is a chance to do something different.”

The league's 2025 NWSL Shield winners, the Kansas City Current, are leading the way with their purpose-built stadium, CPKC Stadium, which hosted the championship last year. “We've seen at CPKC how a purpose-built venue can drive revenue and significantly boost club valuation,” Epstein said.

As a top media market, the upside is obvious: a renovated White Stadium gives the club control of matchday experience and revenue streams. And having Epstein in the driver's seat ensures the team is plugged into the existing machinery of Boston's sports business.

“No league is complete without Boston,” she said a few days after the team secured a $100 million loan from Bank of America to renovate the stadium.

Boston was one of the earliest U.S. cities to embrace women's professional soccer. The Boston Breakers joined the Women's Professional Soccer (WPS) in 2007. After WPS folded, the franchise became one of the eight founding members of the NWSL in 2013. Despite its presence, the team struggled to secure long-term financial stability. After last-minute efforts to sell the club to the New England Revolution's ownership group and to local real estate developers fell through, the Breakers folded on Jan. 25, 2018, leaving Boston without a team as the NWSL entered its sixth season.

But Epstein did not just have a gut feeling that her hometown could support women's soccer again; she had the numbers to prove it could thrive. Sports Innovation Lab, one of the companies she invested in through her venture firm, Juno Equity, surveyed the greater Boston area to gauge the market potential for a women's sports franchise. The results made it clear that the time was right. From the outset, Epstein's group focused less on grassroots energy and more on institutional stability.

Earlier this year, the club stumbled out of the gate with a poorly received branding launch, the ‘Bos Nation' campaign, which drew heavy criticism. After months of fan surveys and listening sessions, they landed on their new name.

“Ultimately, those who were the most displeased with our original name launch are now our biggest supporters,” Epstein said. “I wouldn't recommend saying the strategy when you're launching an expansion team, but I am certainly proud of the work that we did in response.”

Six months before their inaugural season, with infrastructure settled and lessons from early missteps absorbed, both clubs have shifted focus to the business fundamentals that will define their first seasons.

Denver has already landed its first founding partner, CommonSpirit Health, which also secured naming rights for the club's performance center. Boston said the team has opened ticket deposits and will begin converting them into full season ticket sales in the coming weeks.

“The difference between launching a club in 2024 and now is that the awareness is just at a different level,” Millet explained. “When you say we are the Denver Summit, an NWSL club, people know what it is. Two years ago, when we would go out and talk to brands, we had to do a ton of upfront work to explain what NWSL was.”

Despite positive changes, Epstein thinks NWSL is still in the “third inning,” or right above the blade of the hockey stick in its evolution.

The biggest caveat is that both clubs are also entering at a time when the NWSL is under more scrutiny than ever. Player safety issues, controversial decisions from league leadership, and the ongoing challenge of retaining U.S. stars who are lured abroad mean the business environment is as complex as it is promising. Both presidents agree the timing is ideal to build franchises in a booming women's soccer market, but ultimately, success comes down to winning, on the pitch and in the business.

“If you're in the sports business, you should be in it to win,” Cohen said. “I've told everyone our goal is to win from day one. But we all know that most NWSL teams are not making money in the current environment. What we've got to do is get creative around revenue streams. That's part of investing in women's sports the same way we invest in men.”

Q2 Stadium opened its doors less than five years ago, and in a short time it's quickly become a special place for the U.S. Men's National Team. The USMNT is undefeated in Austin, Texas through six games — all of them shutouts. 

The National Team competes in venues across the world, but Austin is one of five cities in the country where the USMNT is unbeaten after at least five games played. AT&T Stadium, up the I-35 in Arlington, Texas holds the longest streak with seven. Both were recent stops in the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup where the United States made a run to the final.

The Americans return to the home of the Austin FC on Oct. 10 to face World Cup-qualified Ecuador at 8:30 p.m. ET in the build-up to the 2026 FIFA tournament next summer. This will be the second friendly, while the other five matches have been tournament games, including the Concacaf Gold Cup and Nations League as well as FIFA World Cup Qualifiers. The first friendly was head coach Mauricio Pochettino's first game — and win — in October 2024. 

It wasn't too long ago when the USMNT last took the field in the Texas capital. The USA took down Saudi Arabia 1-0 in a group stage match of the Gold Cup this past June. Defender Chris Richards earned Man of the Match honors as he scored his second international goal and made a key tackle to prevent a Saudi Arabia potential scoring opportunity. 

The six matches at Q2 have been electric. Three of the outings have been sellouts with a total average attendance of more than 18,000. The USMNT has given fans a lot to cheer for in Austin with 14 goals scored and none allowed. 

Striker Ricardo Pepi and forward Jesús Ferreira have accounted for eight of those goals, scoring four each. The forwards have deep ties to Texas as Pepi grew up in El Paso and Ferreira spent formative years in Dallas, and both came up through the FC Dallas Academy. Ferreira totaled that amount in one match in June 2022 against Grenada in the Nations League opener. The impressive four-goal match tied a USMNT record that only five players have touched. 

The United States will look to continue that winning legacy and go 7-0 in Austin. A victory over Ecuador would extend its win streak versus the CONMEBOL side to four, which would be the longest current streak against a South American opponent.","{'href': 'https://www.ussoccer.com', 'title': 'US Soccer'}","soccer"

By USLSoccer.com Staff, 09/24/25, 11:00AM  EDT 

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. – Fort Lauderdale United FC on Tuesday announced the addition of U.S. Men's National Team and Borussia Mönchengladbach star Giovanni ""Gio"" Reyna to the club's ownership group.  

The investment comes as Fort Lauderdale United embarks on its second Gainbridge Super League season and prepares to launch its men's professional team in USL League One at the start of the 2026 season, building momentum from its women's program and academy teams. FTL UTD also maintains pre-professional teams in USL League Two, the USL W League and USL Academy.

Recognized as one of America's brightest young talents, Gio Reyna has an impressive list of accomplishments in his young career. He became the youngest player in German Bundesliga history to reach 50 appearances with Borussia Dortmund and is the youngest goal scorer in the DFB-Pokal. On the international stage, Reyna has been a key player for the USMNT, winning three Concacaf Nations League titles. He debuted for the USMNT a day before his 18th birthday and was named the 2020 U.S. Soccer Young Male Player of the Year. 

""We are incredibly proud to welcome Gio Reyna to the Fort Lauderdale United family,"" said Tommy Smith, Fort Lauderdale United FC Founder and Chairman. ""This investment not only reflects our club's immense potential but also solidifies our position in the American soccer landscape. With our strong youth program and state-of-the-art facilities, we are proud of our ability to create a signature professional pathway on both the men's and women's sides."" 

Reyna shared his excitement about joining the club. ""What truly sold me on Fort Lauderdale United was the ownership group's comprehensive vision. They're not just creating two professional teams; they're building a complete ecosystem for player development, from the youth level all the way to the pros. Combining that with the fantastic South Florida location and state-of-the-art facilities, it became clear this was a perfect opportunity to not only invest in the club's success but also to help develop the future of American soccer."" 

Hassan Pinto, one of the club's investors, highlighted the group's ability to attract top-tier talent. ""As a professional sporting organization, we have everything right here in Fort Lauderdale to attract world-class players,"" Pinto stated. ""Getting a star like Gio Reyna to invest in Fort Lauderdale United further validates our mission of becoming a shining light in the development of soccer in the United States.""

Pinto was a member of U.S. Soccer's Olympic Development Program with Reyna's father, three-time NCAA champion Claudio Reyna, and attended UNC with Reyna's mother, Danielle, a four-time national champion with UNC and a former member of the USWNT. 

The addition of Reyna as an investor is a powerful endorsement of Fort Lauderdale's vision and its commitment to fostering soccer talent. His experience on the American youth soccer scene, combined with his significant exposure at the elite levels of international football, will provide invaluable insight and a global perspective on the club's development strategies.

Matt Freese left Harvard early, but his education continues.

The 27-year-old goalkeeper has continued to prepare, even as he's waited for his chances throughout his career. First, a trade from the Philadelphia Union to New York City FC ahead of the 2023 season paved the way for him to become an MLS starter. Then this summer, he earned an opportunity to play for the US men's national team, starting in the Concacaf Gold Cup and backstopping the team to a runner-up finish.

Now, Freese is competing to start for the USMNT on home soil at the FIFA 2026 World Cup.

For outsiders, the breakthrough seemed to come out of nowhere. But to those around Freese, who watch him pursue improvement both physically and mentally, they see these opportunities as just rewards.

“When you actually get to know him and you see how much of a student of the game he is, how committed to the craft he is, I don't think you'd be surprised. I'm certainly not surprised by it,” NYCFC assistant coach Rob Vartughian told MLSsoccer.com.

WATCH: Matt Freese on Breakaway

Freese credits intense preparation on the plane from the USMNT's group stage finale to the quarterfinal for his performance in the penalty shootout win over Costa Rica at the Gold Cup, out-dueling goalkeeping legend Keylor Navas.

Yet, that sort of preparation is routine for the NYCFC shot-stopper. In Breakaway, Freese mentions doing film study two days before each match, then watching more film on the day of the game.

“The end goal is obviously to be part of that group in ‘26, but I know that in order to do that, I need to focus on the day-to-day, continue to get better and continue to push myself,” he said.

That attitude has impressed Tony Meola, the USMNT's starting goalkeeper at the 1990 and 1994 World Cups and their third goalkeeper in 2002.

“Most goalkeepers at 27 aren't going to tell you, ‘I got a bunch to learn,'” said Meola, named the 2000 Landon Donovan MLS MVP with the then-Kansas City Wizards.

“At that point, you've established yourself and are staying sharp all the time, right? But he makes no bones about the fact that he still doesn't have a lot of games under his belt and is definitely going to continue to learn and study.”

Freese's PK studies drew attention during the Gold Cup, but Vartughian said Freese looks far beyond one-on-one situations as he prepares for a match. He looks at the opposition as a whole, at player tendencies from open play, and is open to coaching.

“He has the ability to take information in really quickly and apply it,” Vartughian said. “He's the first person to go back and watch training back, the first to come into training and say, ‘Hey, I've got a question about this,' in addition to his own studying.

“He's a consummate professional who doesn't leave anything to a lack of preparation.”

As Freese tries to lock down the USMNT No. 1 job, he faces challenges from fellow goalkeepers based in MLS.

New England Revolution goalkeeper Matt Turner started at the 2022 World Cup and returned to the Revs for consistent playing ahead of ‘26. Colorado Rapids shot-stopper Zack Steffen was in camp with those two goalkeepers ahead of the Gold Cup, only to see an injury rule him out for the continental championship. Columbus Crew's Patrick Schulte has also played under head coach Mauricio Pochettino, while Chicago Fire FC's Chris Brady was at the Gold Cup as well.

With the United States' long tradition of goalkeepers excelling abroad, 2026 could be the first time a domestic-based shot-stopper starts since Meola did so in 1994 as part of U.S. Soccer's centralized team. Meola understands why some fans or analysts would want the tradition to continue, but he isn't worried about what club a national team player represents.

“I just want the best players. I don't care where they play. I think the majority of the team will come from European-based players, but we had some pretty damn good success in 2002 with pretty much a split team,” Meola said. “If we're going to take 26 players, who are the best three goalkeepers?”

Freese signed a contract extension early this month, keeping him with NYCFC through 2030. He hopes to help the club open Etihad Park in 2027 and continue to push for minutes with the USMNT.

“There's levels. Nobody for one second can compare where he is to Man City playing in a UEFA Champions League game, but the reality is you can only deal with the card you're handed,” Vartughian said.

“Right now, that's playing his football for us, and performing week after week for us. We're happy he's doing the job that he is.”

Nick Rimando spent his entire career in MLS, racking up league records for the most career wins, clean sheets and saves along the way, but also winning nearly two dozen caps for the USMNT. He went to Brazil in 2014 knowing he'd be behind then-Premier League standouts Tim Howard (Everton) and Brad Guzan (Aston Villa) on the depth chart. That allowed him to embrace his role and focus on helping those fellow goalkeepers perform their best.

Now, Rimando is happy to see the level of play in MLS, and the quality of goalkeepers who play in the league, continue to rise to a point where the USMNT's goalkeeping room may be entirely domestic-based.

“I love the fact that the league I played in my whole career will possibly have the three goalkeepers going into the World Cup,” Rimando said. “It shows how far the league has come.”

Rimando was in a similar position to Freese in 2013, having been the goalkeeper for the Gold Cup in the year ahead of the World Cup. The Real Salt Lake legend knew he'd have to perform well on the field to be on the World Cup roster, but also that being a positive influence from the hotel lobby to the locker room before and after the match would help him earn a spot.

A place on the World Cup roster may have seemed out of the question for Freese just a couple of years ago. Now, he's looking to not just be on the plane but to be singing the anthem from the field before the opening game.

“It's a competition, but it has to be a friendly competition,” Rimando said. “Obviously, Matt Freese is fighting for that number one position. So for me, the mentality has to be, ‘This is my job to lose,' and going in there performing, but also being that good teammate. Ultimately, the goal is to do well at the World Cup.”

🚨 BREAKING NEWS FROM NYC 🚨 pic.twitter.com/yqxzNbAvM1

Freese's Gold Cup experience has changed very little about who he is, Vartughian asserts. NYCFC's No. 1 is still preparing for matches in the same way, studying opponents, training hard and being a great teammate. But one thing that may put a smile on the face of Rimando and every U.S. fan?

“You're starting to see the confidence that is coming and you're starting to see a different guy, a mentality of a guy who's like, ‘This is mine,'” Vartughian said.

For Freese, that means believing the work is never done, that there's always more to do, another tendency he can spot, another fact about a shooter he can learn. He's had to wait for chances before. Now that opportunities are presenting themselves, Freese is working to seize them.

Alexi Lalas has dropped his usual line of relentlessly lambasting Christian Pulisic to go to the other extreme, hailing the American forward as the best player AC Milan currently boast.

Lalas is an infamously outspoken critic of all that involves the U.S. men's national team (USMNT). Back in 2017, the former international defender brandished Pulisic and his colleagues “a bunch of soft, underperforming, tattooed millionaires” and has maintained a steady stream of dissenting commentary over the subsequent years.

Much like his compatriots Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey, Lalas was unimpressed with Pulisic's decision to skip this summer's Gold Cup. The 27-year-old explained that he needed time off to recovery after a draining European campaign before gearing up for the 2026 World Cup which will be co-hosted by the U.S.

That rest has already paid off. Pulisic boasts five goals across Milan's first six games of the new campaign, taking his tally to 59 in Europe's top five leagues which is a new high among USMNT male players.

Lalas let the excitement of Pulisic's strong form get the better of him. Speaking in the aftermath of Milan's 3–0 win over Udinese, which saw a player Lalas once sarcastically derided as “Wonder Boy” bag a brace, the professional pundit declared: “I think you are looking at it certainly right now, and if you need any more proof, this game is it, that he is an elite player in Serie A. He is, I think arguably the best player for AC Milan.”

Pulisic is the only Milan player with more than one goal to his name this season although Rafael Leão, who has been struggling with injuries, would certainly challenge his claim to be the team's most important figure. Luka Modrić, the former Ballon d'Or holder and six-time Champions League winner, may also have something to say about Lalas's ranking.

Nevertheless, the excitable commentator would not be deterred. “This was a phenomenal game,” he continued. “I think something that he will remember and Pulisic fans, fans of the U.S. national team and AC Milan fans can appreciate, and I think we'll remember for a long time. Everything he touched seemed to turn to gold.

“So this was everything that Christian Pulisic is encapsulated into one game. And rightfully he is receiving the flowers that a performance like that and combined with I think a consistency now of quality and elite performances that was attributed to him.”

President met South American powerbrokers in NYC

World body would face opposition to 64-team plan

Fifa is not planning to expand the men's World Cup to 64 teams for the centenary edition of the tournament in 2030, despite its president, Gianni Infantino, meeting a delegation of South America leaders to discuss the idea in New York.

Infantino met the Uruguay and Paraguay heads of state, the president of South American confederation, Conmebol, as well the presidents of the Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay federations at Fifa's offices in Trump Tower on Tuesday for the first formal discussions about a proposal that was raised informally by the Uruguayan Football Association at a Fifa Council meeting last March.

Fifa's official position is that it will discuss World Cup expansion with all its stakeholders and that it is duty-bound to consider proposals raised at council. But behind the scenes there is scepticism about whether expanding the tournament to 64 teams is a viable proposition. Next year's World Cup will be the first to contain 48 teams, while the governing body has broken with convention for 2030 by staging the tournament in six countries on three continents. Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina will host the first three matches in tribute to the competition's South American origins in 1930, before the bulk of the tournament moves to Morocco, Spain and Portugal.

Any decision to expand the World Cup would be taken by Fifa Council, which meets in Zurich next month, but that is not on the agenda.

“Gianni would not get that vote through Council even if he wanted to,” a Fifa source said. “The overwhelming feeling around the table – and not just in Europe – is that 64 teams would damage the World Cup. There'd be too many uncompetitive matches and it would risk damaging the business model.”

Conmebol would be the major beneficiaries of another expansion and sources with knowledge of Tuesday's meeting disclosed that Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina claimed to have the capability to host all of the group stage.

Expansion to 64 teams would mean more than 30% of Fifa's 211 member associations would take part, as well as putting all 10 Conmebol in the frame to qualify, up from six direct qualifiers next year, plus the possibility of an extra place via an inter-confederation playoff.

The 64-team idea was first presented at Fifa Council last April, but prompted an immediate backlash. The Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, described it as a “bad idea” that would reduce the quality of the tournament and undermine the qualifying competition. The Concacaf president, Victor Montagliani, said: “They [Fifa] can study all they want, but it just doesn't feel right.” Significantly, both men are Fifa vice-presidents.

Fifa is also facing calls from leading European clubs to expand the Club World Cup from 32 teams in 2029 due to the huge prize and appearance money on offer. Chelsea collected £85m for winning it in July. Staging the competition every two years is also being considered.

A 64-team World Cup would feature 128 matches, double the number played at the most recent tournament in Qatar three years ago and 24 more than next year. The World Cup has grown significantly in recent decades, increasing from 16 to 24 teams in 1982, growing again to 32 in 1998 before becoming a 48-team competition next summer.

Any decision to expand the World Cup would be taken by Fifa's Council, which meets in Zurich next month, although the issue is not thought to be on the agenda.

The boy who gave Barcelona hope


When Ansu Fati made his debut for FC Barcelona in 2019, at just 16 years, 9 months, and 25 days old, he looked destined for greatness. A product of La Masía, he was seen as the heir to fill the void Lionel Messi would eventually leave. His flair, fearlessness, and goal-scoring instinct instantly made him the jewel Barcelona fans had been waiting for.





The club quickly secured him with a €400 million release clause in 2019, and by 2021 it was raised to €1 billion—right after he inherited Messi's legendary No. 10 shirt following the Argentine's move to PSG. What seemed like the start of a golden era soon turned into a nightmare.


The nightmare of injuries


In November 2020, Ansu suffered a torn meniscus in his left knee, an injury that required four surgeries and kept him sidelined for nearly a year. That was only the beginning of a downward spiral that pulled him away from the glorious path many thought was his destiny.

When he returned, he was no longer the same. His physical condition lagged, his confidence dipped, and under Xavi Hernández, he slipped from the bench to the stands. Eventually, Barcelona loaned him to Brighton in the Premier League, but the spark never came back.






Brighton struggles and a gray return to Barça


With the Seagulls, Ansu made 30 appearances across all competitions, but managed just 4 goals and 1 assist. His underwhelming stint brought him back to Barcelona carrying more doubts than answers.

Under Hansi Flick, things worsened: only 11 games played, totaling 298 minutes. A far cry from the expectations set for the player once seen as the face of Barça's future.


A new light in Monaco


Just when his career seemed to fade, AS Monaco opened a new door. His move in the latest transfer window has breathed fresh life into his journey. Though he took time to make his debut, he made an immediate impact: scoring in his Champions League debut against Club Brugge, and just three days later, netting a brace in his Ligue 1 debut versus Metz.

Football always offers second chances, and Ansu's might finally have arrived. It's too early to declare a full comeback, but the signs are promising. The football world would welcome the return of a player once hailed as Messi's heir—one who still has the potential to shine just as brightly as promised from the very start.

Welcome to the ESPN Singapore Edition

The Under-20 World Cup is often a place to find the next generation of young talent coming through and the latest tournament kicks off in Chile on Saturday.

Some of the world's highest-profile countries are involved, so here's a collection of players who you should be aware of from all 24 nations.

NEW ZEALAND: Luke Brooke-Smith, 17, AM, Wellington Phoenix (A-League/NZL)

A lively, direct, quick and incisive attacking midfielder who can play on either wing. Brooke-Smith (pictured) has a quick first step and is good with either foot, which gives him the option to take on opponents from either side. Already a semi-regular at club level, he and made his senior All Whites debut earlier this month vs. Australia, becoming their second-youngest debutant. Watch for him to create danger in transition.

CHILE: Juan Francisco Rossel, 20, FW, Unversidad Catolica (CHI)

A tall, movement-based forward who scored five goals in the South American qualifiers and is starting to integrate with the first-team squad for his club. His key features are excellent close control, ability to shield the ball, combinational awareness and a powerful, right-footed shot. Rossel also picks smart positions and makes things happen across the attacking line.

EGYPT: Mohamed El-Sayed, 19, CM, Zamalek (EGY)

A holding/box-to-box presence in the Egypt midfield, El-Sayed was influential in the African qualifying tournament. He is composed in possession, secure in tight areas, and efficient at moving the ball on. Hard-working and tactically astute, he reads the tempo of the game well, links play and already looks physically adapted to senior football at local powerhouses Zamalek.

JAPAN: Rion Ichihara, 20, CB, Omiya Ardija (JPN)

An assertive center back with nearly 75 league games to his name, Ichihara has been a regular at J2 level since the age of 18. He reads the game well, deals well with one-vs.-ones and anticipates attacking threats, while he is also a steady passer. He is a natural focal point in this Japan side and leads from the back.

PARAGUAY: Diego León, 18, LB, Manchester United (ENG)

Signed by Manchester United for around $4 million from Cerro Porteño, following an impressive qualification tournament for Paraguay, the attack-minded left back (pictured) possesses the stamina and running power to cover the entire flank, always offering an option out wide with his relentless runs forward. León has already appeared on the bench for Man United in the Premier League and has a dangerous left foot when it comes to crosses and set pieces.

PANAMA: Rafael Mosquera, 20, AM, NY Red Bulls (MLS/USA)

Mosquera is a versatile attacker who usually operates on the left wing but carries the profile of an all-round forward. With impressive acceleration and unpredictable movements, he is a proper livewire in the final third and is likely to present Panama's main goal threat in Chile. Strong and imposing, he has been productive for NYRB's NextGen side and recently made his debut in MLS.

SOUTH KOREA: Min-ha Shin, 20, CB, Gangwon FC (KOR)

Shin is an agile and quick center back who combines a proactive style (6+ interceptions per 90 minutes) with a reliable passing game, and he has already made an impact at senior club level. Though he has strong game-reading skills in defensive situations, he's also improving the physical side of his game and is sure to be on the radar of some top European clubs.

UKRAINE: Hennadiy Synchuk, 19, AM, CF Montreal (MLS / CAN)

Having made the move from Metalist Kharkiv to MLS in January for around $3.5 million, the left-footed winger is already competing for a regular starting spot. Synchuk looks to find space between the defensive lines from his inverted position out wide on the right, and evades markers well with a quick first step (4+ successful dribbles per 90 minutes.) Ukraine will look to him for creativity, and he poses a significant threat with his excellent left foot.

MEXICO: Gilberto Mora, 16, AM, Tijuana (MEX)

Dubbed as Mexico's next star in the making, Mora (pictured) made his Liga MX debut at age 15 and became the youngest player ever to win a senior trophy with the country when they lifted the Gold Cup this summer. He can feature as a No. 10 or inverted winger, and backs up a brilliant touch on the ball with outstanding passing abilities, rapid execution technique and good vision. Though he is somewhat slight physically, he is able to pick smart pockets of space to gain an extra second or two on the ball.

BRAZIL: Pedrinho, 19, CM, FC Zenit (RUS)

Even with a number of high-profile absences, the perennial U20 World Cup favorites can still lean on this left-footed livewire. Pedrinho stands out for his brilliant technique and excellent ball-carrying, and he can operate on either flank, or centrally as a box-to-box No. 8 or No. 10 behind the striker. He can beat his markers with quick footwork, delicate touches and disguised changes of direction, but also links the play quickly, presses with energy, pushes into the attacking box and releases the ball early in the final third.

MOROCCO: Fouad Zahouani, 19, LB, FC Tourga (MAR)

One of the top defenders from the recent U20 Africa Cup of Nations, the 19-year-old plays on the front foot and, though he hasn't quite filled out physically, deals well with defensive one-vs.-ones. Zahouani is also very good in the air for a left back and often arrives at the back post to attack crosses or set pieces. Furthermore, as he is so safe in possession, he can choose to find clever passing options centrally.

SPAIN: Adrián Liso, 20, AM, Getafe (ESP)

In a Spain squad dominated by big-club prospects [8/21 are from Real Madrid, Barcelona or Atlético Madrid], it's worth keeping an extra eye on the Getafe winger who started his LaLiga career in spectacular fashion with three goals from his first two matches last month. Liso is different to a lot of the young attacking players in Spain by being relatively physical; yet his off-the-ball movement is incisive and he is quick with the ball at his feet to gain valuable meters.

ARGENTINA: Maher Carrizo, 19, AM/FW, Velez Sarsfield (ARG)

Argentina arrive short of several headline names who were not released by their clubs (such as Manchester City's Claudio Echeverri), but Carrizo (pictured, left) will look to fill the void. A left-footed right winger for Velez, he struck four goals in CONMEBOL U20 qualifying and has five league goals in 2025. Direct and decisive, he attacks without hesitation and with high intensity, always looking for options by dribbling at his opponent, swift passing exchanges or an early finish. With an excellent first touch, sharp bursts of pace and instinctive take-ons, he could be one of the most game-changing wingers on show.

AUSTRALIA: Luka Jovanovic, 20, ST, Adelaide United (A-League/AUS)

While still developing stylistically, Jovanovic is expected to be Australia's main focal point in attack. Something of a traditional No. 9 / poacher hybrid, the 20-year-old has 11 goals in over 50 A-League games and has a good technical foundation, a powerful shot (0.50 xG per 90 minutes last season), fine ball-shielding abilities and enough acceleration to craft decent chances for himself in the box.

CUBA: Karel Perez, 20, LB/CB, SC Vianense (POR)

Cuba's captain and most-merited defender, Perez operates either as a left back or in the center of defense. Already capped at senior international level, he found an interesting pathway to European football by joining a club in the fourth tier of Portuguese football, so will surely be looking to make a step up. He is physically strong and has good recovery speed, while he can also find passing options further forward with his left foot.

ITALY: Ismael Konate, 20, ST, Empoli (ITA)

Italy arrive in Chile heavily depleted as many of their best U20 players are absent due to club duties, but Konate showed plenty of promise in Serie A last season. A No. 9 striker who leads the line well, often engaging center backs to free up space for his teammates, he is strong in the air and presses dutifully off the ball.

UNITED STATES: Benjamin Cremaschi, 20, CM, Parma (ITA)

Loaned to Parma from Inter Miami CF this season, Cremaschi (pictured) is still looking to add Serie A minutes to an impressive CV that already includes three USMNT caps, 70-odd MLS outings and Club World Cup appearances. A creative central midfielder with quick, reliable close control and intelligent passing, he has fine balance and is able to evade opponents on the half-turn and get out of tight situations. He also has an impressive work-rate.

FRANCE: Dylian N'Guessan, 17, FW, Saint-Etienne (FRA)

The youngest member of the French squad, N'Guessan is undoubtedly the one with the highest development ceiling. While the silky teenager did get playing time at club level last season, he's yet to feature following their relegation due to injury. However, he will get his chance in Chile and is direct, lively and technically well-equipped. N'Guessan thrives in space on the left side and often finds his target once he shifts the ball onto this favored right foot.

NEW CALEDONIA: Jytrhim Upa, 18, RB, Tiga Sport (NCD)

A survivor from the New Caledonia under-17 side that featured in the World Cup two years ago, Upa is an active, aggressive right back. Though he usually lines up as a wing-back, he can cover the entire flank, supporting the attack in a side that see little of the ball in the opposing half. He is also a decent striker of crosses.

SOUTH AFRICA: Neo Rapoo, 20, LB, Siwelele FC (RSA)

Rapoo is a left back who can impact both ends of the pitch and is already a regular in the South African Premier League. He has excellent pace, mobility and provides a constant overlapping presence on the left. But he also balances attack and defense well, having created 12 goal-scoring opportunities this season while only being dribbled past once in the league.

SAUDI ARABIA: Thamer Al-Khaibri, 19, ST, NEOM FC (KSA)

Arguably Saudi Arabia's most influential attacker in the qualifying campaign, Al-Khaibri (pictured) is a poacher in the box who relies on smart positioning to get on the end of chances. Though not a natural creator, he reacts well from crosses and slide-passes from midfield, while he also attacks space in behind the defense and can finish expertly with his left foot.

COLOMBIA: Néiser Villarreal, 20, ST, Millionarios (COL)

A powerful center forward whose eight goals in CONMEBOL U20 qualifying made him top scorer, Villarreal has an impressive profile for a modern No. 9 striker. There's plenty of pace and penetration, as he works the channels well, while he possesses a fairly developed linkup game too. In the box, he attacks crosses wholeheartedly and doesn't need many touches before getting his shot away. But any interested clubs should know that he is already set to join Brazilian club Cruzeiro in December.

NIGERIA: Sani Suleiman, 19, AM, AS Trencin (SVK)

The main attacking protagonist in a somewhat depleted Nigeria squad, Suleiman should excite plenty of scouts in Chile. He is already a regular for Slovakian side AS Trencin and offers many of the desired attributes of a modern winger. From his position wide on the left, he likes to cut inside with acceleration and body feints to find the far corner with a low shot. He is also direct and confident on his left foot too, and a consistent supplier of crosses.

NORWAY: Sondre Granaas, 19, CM/AM, Molde (NOR)

Granaas has worked his way into first-team contention for Molde this season. Indeed, the No. 8 / winger hybrid is positive in his play, pushes into the box, strikes the ball with precision (he scored against England and Germany at the Under-19 Euros) and also puts in a respectable shift defensively. Norway are another side in this tournament with a plethora of absentees, so he should get plenty of chances to shine.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com.sg', 'title': 'ESPN Singapore'}","soccer"

Hello! Some free advice for a Wednesday: soccer investment is cheaper than NFL investment. And keep your shirt on…

On the way:

🏈 EPL vs NFL valuations

📈 A 64-team World Cup?

🟥 Ekitike's ‘stupid' red card

👏 Classy Vini Jr finish

Sold for their market value of $12.8billion (£9.4bn), the Dallas Cowboys would raise enough money to buy Real Madrid and Barcelona combined, with a sliver of spare change left over. Or, if you'd rather, Liverpool, Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Miami. Football is your oyster, essentially, if you happen to own the NFL's richest franchise.

Valuations in sports are so extreme these days that when the proposed sale of the LA Lakers in June priced them at $10bn, it occurred to me that ownership is now limited to the highest of high rollers. Yet despite its wealth and ever-increasing reach, the cost of soccer teams doesn't quite match up to those in other U.S. fields.

In the weeks and months ahead, it's possible — and probable — that one of the biggest Spanish sides going will pass into American ownership (doesn't everybody, eventually?). Atletico Madrid, as reported yesterday, are the subject of a takeover bid from Apollo Global Management, an asset firm based on Wall Street. If and when the transaction goes through, it will value them at $2.6bn. In other words, one Dallas Cowboys buys you five Atleticos.

With prescient timing, The Athletic's Chris Weatherspoon addressed this exact topic this morning: the reasons why certain NFL franchises (not to mention some in basketball and baseball) are worth more than Premier League clubs and other European football giants. And will we hit a point where the balance tips, making soccer the biggest investment show in town?

To some extent, soccer is the biggest investment show in town already. Professional football clubs vastly outnumber NFL franchises, and takeover bids coming out of the U.S. over the past five to 10 years are almost too numerous to count. Half of the Premier League is American-owned.

But any time I think of the size of the NFL, I think of the fabled waiting list for season tickets at the Green Bay Packers, reported to sit at around 150,000 names and counting. As Chris points out, franchises like the Packers have enormous captive audiences, making them a commercial dream. No business is ever unhappy about being oversubscribed.

He also highlighted a few other reasons for the disparity in valuations:

FIFA, in particular, would love to think that someday soon, football will take over the planet in its entirety. It's why the governing body targeted the U.S. with both its Club World Cup and next year's World Cup. The game's popularity grows exponentially — but American sport is still where the biggest fortunes stand to be blown.

Alexander Isak banked his first Liverpool goal last night (an instalment on £125m paid back) but sadly for him, nobody is talking about it.

A 2-1 third-round Carabao Cup victory over Southampton was more notable for what happened later in the tie. Hugo Ekitike, the other big-money forward signed by Liverpool over the summer, won it in the 85th minute… and then immediately got himself sent off.

Ekitike, you see, said emotions got the better of him and seemingly forgot he'd already been booked for punching the ball away. So when he took his shirt off to celebrate his goal — a yellow card offence in itself — he was cautioned for a second time. As red cards go, it's more dense than a chunk of osmium.

Arne Slot wasn't remotely sympathetic. “Needless and stupid,” was how Liverpool's head coach described it. The upshot is that Ekitike misses their next game through suspension, away at Crystal Palace on Saturday (a tricky fixture against a side with their tails up). Isak's had a torrid time in the PR stakes recently but, for one evening only, he won't have minded holding Ekitike's beer.

Diego Gomez should have something about him. It wasn't as if he came for pennies. The deal which brought him to Brighton from Inter Miami in January cost £11m.

But four goals away at Barnsley in the Carabao Cup last night was an absurd flex, not least because two of them were goal-of-the-season contenders. The strike for 3-0, above, is the pick of them for me. I could watch that swerve on a loop all day.

Dembélé, the new king of football


The 2025 Ballon d'Or crowned Ousmane Dembélé as the best player in the world after a spectacular season with PSG. The Frenchman lifted the Champions League, Ligue 1, French Cup and French Super Cup, while scoring 35 goals and adding 16 assists. Numbers that finally established him as the undisputed leader he had long been expected to become. 





The vote confirmed what many anticipated: Dembélé's maturity placed him above everyone else, even one of the brightest young stars on the planet.


Yamal, the big loser of the night


On the other side stood Lamine Yamal, the 18-year-old prodigy who dreamed of becoming the youngest Ballon d'Or winner in history. His silence after the ceremony reflected the blow of hearing Dembélé's name instead of his.





Although he was recognized with the 2025 Kopa Trophy as the world's best young player, Yamal had prepared a private celebration in Paris with family and friends that never came to be. His defeat left a bittersweet taste: a secure future, but still without the ultimate glory.


The Champions League twist


What the Ballon d'Or separated, the Champions League will bring back together. On October 1, Yamal's Barcelona will visit Dembélé's PSG in the second matchday of the continental tournament.

It will be a clash loaded with intrigue: the new Ballon d'Or holder against the player many believe is destined to dominate the next decade. Paris will once again set the stage for their story, only this time on the pitch, with the ball rolling and the chance to prove who truly deserves the throne.

A comeback full of symbolism


José Mourinho never leaves anyone indifferent. Just weeks after ending his spell at Fenerbahçe, the Portuguese coach is back where it all began: Benfica. The dismissal of Bruno Lage, following the Eagles' painful Champions League defeat to Qarabag, opened the door for The Special One to return to the Estádio da Luz.





The story has a curious, even controversial twist: it was Benfica who eliminated Fenerbahçe from the Champions League shortly before Mourinho's arrival. In Turkey, many view it as a hidden betrayal, while in Portugal, it feels like a circle being closed.


Closing the circle in Lisbon


Mourinho had already experienced a brief spell at Benfica back in 2000. It lasted just nine games, but it was the first step in a career that would take him to the very top of European football. From there, he moved to Porto, where he became a legend by winning two league titles, a UEFA Cup and the Champions League that changed his life.





That meteoric rise catapulted him to Chelsea, Inter, Real Madrid and Manchester United. Titles, controversies and unforgettable quotes made him an unrepeatable figure. In recent years, however, his trophy cabinet lost its shine: the Conference League with Roma and barren spells at Tottenham and Fenerbahçe were a far cry from the dominant Mourinho of another era.


Between betrayal and excitement


Returning to Benfica means more than coming home — it also means taking charge of Porto's eternal rival, the very club that made him a legend. It's reminiscent of what he experienced in Spain when he joined Real Madrid, knowing he would divide passions and fire up opposing fans.

In Lisbon, Mourinho is chasing what he has sought in recent years: a return to the elite, the joy of football, and another chapter of glory. This is his home, this is Portugal, and this is the Champions League — the stage where he has always felt most alive. And while some may call it betrayal, he sees it as another chance to be happy.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino met on Tuesday in New York with CONMEBOL president Alejandro Domínguez and leaders of three South American soccer federations to discuss the expansion of the men's 2030 World Cup to 64 teams.

CONMEBOL's proposal for expansion was first introduced in March by a delegate from Uruguay during an online meeting of the ruling council of world soccer's governing body.

On Tuesday, however, Dominguez met with Infantino and the federation presidents of Argentina and Uruguay, as well as the President of Paraguay, Santiago Peña, and of Uruguay, Yamandú Orsi to discuss the proposal further, marking the first time the CONMEBOL leaders presented the concept directly to Infantino.

""We believe in a historic 2030 World Cup!"" Domínguez said in a social media post after the meeting. ""Thank you, President Gianni Infantino, for welcoming us and sharing this journey toward the centennial of football's greatest celebration. We want to call for unity, creativity, and believing big. Because when football is shared by everyone, the celebration is truly global.""

For the first time since the 1998 edition, the World Cup is set to expand from a 32-team format to 48 teams in 2026.

The 2030 World Cup is already set to be the most sprawling edition with six host nations spread across three continents.

Uruguay was the original World Cup host in 1930 and is scheduled to stage one game. Paraguay, Argentina, Spain, Portugal and Morocco are also co-hosts.

""I had the honor of being part of the FIFA summit, organized by Gianni Infantino, with the goal of starting to organize what will be the 2030 World Cup. It was truly a pleasure to have represented our country at this important meeting,"" Argentina federation president Claudio Chiqui Tapia said in a social media post. ""We are family and we have done our part to request this meeting so our dream can become reality.""

Expanding to 64 teams likely would guarantee all 10 CONMEBOL member countries a place in a bigger tournament. Venezuela is the only one that has never qualified for a World Cup.

The President of Argentina Javier Milei was not in attendance at the meeting but Paraguay's President Santiago Peña and Uruguay's President Yamandú Orsi participated in the meeting at FIFA's Trump Tower offices.

FIFA general secretary Mattias Grafström was also in attendance.

""As we get closer to the date, we must reiterate that this cannot be just another event, it cannot be just another World Cup. We believe this is a once-in-a-century opportunity to have the group stage matches played in Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay,"" Domínguez said.

If FIFA approves the move, it would create a tournament of 128 matches, double the number of the 64-game format that was played from 1998 through 2022. Earlier this year, UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin called a 64-team World Cup ""a bad idea.""

Critics of the 64-team proposal have argued it will weaken the quality of play and devalue the qualifying program in most continents.

Its resale platform will provide fans looking to sell or buy tickets with a safe and secure method to do so, says Fifa's media director Bryan Swanson

With reference to your article (World Cup's dynamic pricing model lays bare Fifa's singular motive: profit, at all costs, 4 September), Fifa is a not-for-profit organisation. The revenue it generates is reinvested to fuel the growth of football – men, women, youth – throughout Fifa's 211 member associations globally.

Fifa is focused on ensuring fair access to our game for existing, but also prospective fans. Fifa will retain ringfenced allocations that are set aside for specific fan categories, and these allocations will be set at a fixed price.

The Fifa resale platform will provide fans looking to sell or buy tickets on the secondary market with a safe and secure method to do so, as permitted by US legislation. The fact that secondary market activity is legally open renders it necessary to have a ticketing model that reflects our responsibility to provide access to fans, while at the same time ensuring as much value as possible is retained for redistribution into the game around the world.Bryan SwansonFifa director of media, Zurich","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

The FIFA World Cup 2026 is poised to be the largest of its kind, expanding from 32 teams to 48, with matches scheduled to be played across the North American continent. United 2026, the joint bid by the host nations, consists of the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

However, the sheer size of this football tournament casts a dark shadow on the environment, even threatening livelihoods. Sponsorship deals with fossil fuel companies, extensive air travel, suppression of protests from local communities, and construction on forests all set the 2026 iteration to be the one with the highest carbon footprint yet.

A new report by Scientists for Global Responsibility, “FIFA's Climate Blind Spot: The Men's World Cup in a Warming World,” finds that the expansion of the tournament from 32 to 48 teams will lead to a significant increase in emissions for the 2026, 2030, and 2034 iterations of the event — particularly due to air transport for teams, staff, and fans.

The report estimates that the World Cup will generate at least 9.0 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, the highest ever in the event's 95-year history. The Spanish-led 2030 iteration will lead to 6.1 million tCO2e, and the 2034 Finals in Saudi Arabia will be responsible for 8.6 million tCO2e.

FIFA has not had the best track record in staying aligned with climate strategies. In 2021, FIFA launched an initiative at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), pledging to reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by 2040.

But the credibility of FIFA's previous claims of carbon neutrality at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar has already been questioned by multiple groups. The Swiss Commission for Fairness, based in Zurich, also reported that the organization was “not able to provide proof that the claims were accurate” and “did not set out a plan to define how it will further offset emissions”.

FIFA's case becomes even more questionable considering notable sponsors of the event include airline and oil companies such as Qatar Airways and Aramco.

“How is it possible that they have a first-class stadium, and next to it, a town that's dead?”

While the event will use existing venues, instead of requiring the construction of newer ones, preparations and expansions continue to hurt local communities.

People living in areas surrounding the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City say development plans for the area will worsen the water supply and threaten green spaces.

“We have a right to constitution,” says Rubén Ramírez, a community leader in Santa Úrsula Coapa, a district in Mexico City. “They're ignoring us completely. We don't know anything.”

The constitution states that in the case of constructing on Indigenous land, authorities must legally consult local communities and leaders, such as Ramírez. However, their protests are being ignored as the government continues preparations for the World Cup.

There are even plans to turn a 5,000-square-meter forest area inside Santa Úrsula into a construction site.

“They can't take it, this is the lungs of the community,” says Ramírez. “Why do they have to build it here? Take it somewhere else.”

It is estimated that the World Cup will inject up to £5.2 billion into the country, locking the Mexican government's interests entirely.

The biggest issue, however, might be the water supply. Water shortages are a common issue across Mexico City, and the Azteca district is further threatened by the expansion of the stadium. Televisa, a company that partly owns the Azteca stadium, privatized a well in the area in 2018, further worsening the condition, as the Santa Úrsula community protests that this contract was illegal and has contributed to exploitation.

“The stadium is part of the community's territory,” says Ramírez. “It's the owners, the businesspeople who are going to benefit from the World Cup. What are the community going to see? Nothing.”

To counteract these effects, the report suggests that FIFA:

Man City boss will only take his new-look side backwards if he continues looking to his old foe for tactical inspiration","https://www.goal.com/en-gb/lists/pep-guardiola-jose-mourinho-man-city-boss-take-side-backwards-great-rival-tactical-inspiration/blt4f17fe40246d027f","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 07:00:00 GMT","

Much of the aftermath of Manchester City's 1-1 draw with Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium focused on the cautious tactics of the hosts, somehow ignoring that it was the visitors who resorted to park-the-bus mechanisms in order to try and grind out a win. In the end, neither side truly deserved the victory and a point apiece seemed fair, but the performance from Pep Guardiola's men was strange in several ways.

Having lost 5-1 in this very same fixture back in February against a weaker Arsenal team than this, you can forgive City for returning to north London with the handbrake on. If they suffered another obliteration in that manner, they could already begin to kiss their Premier League title dreams goodbye.

In order to prevent this, Guardiola set out his stall in a far more conservative manner than ever before. Given Mikel Arteta had also picked a starting lineup showing a bit too much respect, City were actually good value for their 1-0 lead at half-time, hitting the Gunners with a killer counter which was expertly finished off by Erling Haaland. That excursion nine minutes in appeared to signal the end of their ambition, however, mustering up only one other chance of note from there on in. Nobody in blue could have any complaints about their barricades finally being breached by one straight ball over the top and a delectable dink from Gabriel Martinelli.

It begs the question over where City are going. Are they actually serious contenders or are they still way behind in their rebuild? Can Guardiola reinvent himself to keep up with this new wave of managers?","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Tyrique George saved Chelsea's blushes with a goal and an assist but goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen had a shocker in the absence of Robert Sanchez. The Blues came from a goal down to knock Lincoln City out of the Carabao Cup with a 2-1 third round win but the Club World Cup champions were given a real scare. There will be plenty to ponder for Enzo Maresca, especially after a wretched first half.

Chelsea appeared to have a hangover from their 2-1 loss to Manchester United at the weekend as Lincoln began in ferocious fashion. After Lewis Montsma's shot hit the post and the Blues survived a goalmouth scramble, the hosts deservedly took the lead in the 42nd minute when Rob Street pounced upon some shocking defending at the back.

The west London outfit looked down and out at the break, but George's piledriver from the edge of the box levelled the scores in the 48th minute, and then Facundo Buonanotte made it 2-1 after waltzing by some would-be defenders two minutes later. 

Maresca's team never looked secure with their lead, particularly as Jorgensen was having a shocker in the Chelsea goal. But in the end, they just about squeaked past the League One team on Tuesday night to progress to the next round.

Alexander Isak's first goal for Liverpool should have been the story after Tuesday night's 2-1 win over Southampton at Anfield. Instead, it was Hugo Ekitike getting himself stupidly sent off after netting the winner.

Isak opened the scoring in the Carabao Cup third-round clash on Merseyside with a characteristically cool finish just before the interval - and only 58 seconds after Leo Scienza had headed wide with the Liverpool goal at his mercy.

However, Arne Slot's side failed to killed the game and Southampton sensationally drew level with 14 minutes to go when Shea Charles punished a dreadful attempted clearance from Wataru Endo. Unfortunately for the Championship side, Liverpool weren't done and, for the sixth time this season, they scored a late winner, with Ekitike tapping home a pass from Chiesa.

The drama wasn't over, though, as Ekitike clearly forgot that he was already on a booking, meaning the French forward saw red for foolishly removing his shirt to show the crowd the name on the back of his shirt and will, thus, be suspended for Saturday's Premier League trip to Crystal Palace.

With less than two months to go until the Nitto ATP Finals, the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin is heating up. Following ATP 250 events in Chengdu and Hangzhou, ATPTour.com looks at the movers of the week in the Live Race To Turin as of Wednesday 24 September.



Lorenzo Musetti - seventh (3,235 points), +1
The Italian boosted his chances of competing at the Nitto ATP Finals for the first time following a run to the final in Chengdu. Musetti dropped one set en route to the final, gaining 165 points in his quest to make his debut on home soil at the prestigious year-end event. However, he fell agonisingly short of his third ATP Tour title and first since 2022, squandering two championship points in his defeat to Alejandro Tabilo.

 Alexander Bublik - 12th (2,370), +3
Bublik continued his career-best season at the ATP 250 in Hangzhou, where he clinched his fourth title of the year. The 28-year-old did not drop serve all week, joining Taylor Fritz as the only players this season to win a tour-level title without losing a game on their own delivery.
Highlighted by title runs in Halle, Gstaad, Kitzbuehel and Hangzhou, Bublik now boasts a 31-17 record in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, and is joined by only Carlos Alcaraz as winning four or more trophies this year. The Kazakhstani is up three spots to 12th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and is in contention of qualifying for the Nitto ATP Finals for the first time.
Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have already qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals, taking place from 9-16 November at Inalpi Arena in Turin.

Two and a half weeks on from his US Open final defeat to Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner has had time to process his four-set loss in New York and is implementing change.

The Italian overcame the Spaniard in the Wimbledon final in July but struggled to match the 22-year-old at Flushing Meadows, with Alcaraz improving to 10-5 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Small tweaks are now the name of the game for Sinner, who could face Alcaraz again in October at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Shanghai.
“We've been reflecting a lot on that final,” Sinner said ahead of his opening match at the China Open in Beijing. “We are working on new things. We are changing a lot of small things. The amount of mistakes at the moment is for sure a little bit higher, but I hope that this recovers.
“It's just a question of time. I don't know how much I'm able to [implement changes] on the actual match court because one thing is practise and one thing is match. Let's see. I'm very motivated. It's great to work on something new, then we see how this ends up. We always try to move forward. One step in front is always better than two steps back. Let's see what we can do.”

He also respects how we are as a team. It's not that he comes in and he changes everything. If he sees that we have or could potentially improve something for my body, he's here to help. This is how it works.
“But it also takes time. I've worked with him a little bit in the years when I didn't have my physio. Not as much. Obviously now having him for me, it's a huge privilege. He's super, super experienced.”

The No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings Sinner will face former Beijing finalist Marin Cilic in his opening match at the ATP 500 hard-court event and will hope for another deep run to close the gap on World No. 1 Alcaraz, who returned to top spot following the US Open final.
Sinner is 37-5 on the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index and has already qualified for this year's Nitto ATP Finals in Turin, having won the prestigious year-end event last season.

“We've been reflecting a lot on that final,” Sinner said ahead of his opening match at the China Open in Beijing. “We are working on new things. We are changing a lot of small things. The amount of mistakes at the moment is for sure a little bit higher, but I hope that this recovers.
“It's just a question of time. I don't know how much I'm able to [implement changes] on the actual match court because one thing is practise and one thing is match. Let's see. I'm very motivated. It's great to work on something new, then we see how this ends up. We always try to move forward. One step in front is always better than two steps back. Let's see what we can do.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Alcaraz one step ahead of Sinner: 'I know he's going to change'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-tokyo-2025-preview","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 10:07:37 GMT","

Carlos Alcaraz may be making his Tokyo debut this week while Jannik Sinner battles in Beijing, but the Spaniard can't help studying their growing rivalry.

After toppling Sinner in the US Open final, Alcaraz extended his Lexus ATP Head2Head lead to 10-5, winning seven of their past eight clashes. That loss cost Sinner the No. 1 spot in the PIF ATP Rankings and also prompted the Italian to hint at changes. Alcaraz, however, believes he's still one step ahead.

“I know he's going to change,” Alcaraz said of Sinner during a pre-tournament press conference in Tokyo. “He is going to change something from the last match. It's the same thing that I did when I lost to him a couple of times. I tried to be a better player. Next time I'm going to face him so I expect him to do the same thing to change a few things just to be ready and I have to be focused and I have to be ready for the changes.

“I will try to overcome those changes [and] be ready for that rivalry. I think it's getting better for me and for tennis. We will see in the future how many times I'm going to play against him and in which circumstances we would play. But I think right now it's going great.”



It's been a dominant year for Alcaraz. With a Tour-leading 62 wins and seven trophies this season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, he is already just four victories away from eclipsing his personal tally of 65 wins from 2023.

He is also the runaway leader in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and is in good stead to claim his second ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF finish. Despite his success, Alcaraz downplayed any talk of chasing the ‘greatest of all time' label.

“It's something that's not in my mind right now,” Alcaraz said when asked of his aim to become the best player ever. “I always say that my goal in tennis is to try to be at the same table as the legends or the best players in history, but it's not something that I'm thinking about right now. I've achieved great things already in just 22 years.

“I already know that but I don't know in the future how many things or how many tournaments I'm going to achieve. So I think it's something that I have to take care of every day about the details about everything practising well and we will see in the future. I think nobody knows the future. So what I'm thinking right now is to do the good things that I've been doing, following the good path. I'm trying to be the best player and the best person I can be every day. That's all I'm thinking right now.”

That journey continues this week at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships, where Alcaraz aims to join 12 fellow ATP No. 1 Club members who have triumphed in Tokyo.

This time last year, Alcaraz defeated Sinner in a thrilling final to lift the Beijing trophy, but in 2025 he has opted to compete at the ATP 500 in Tokyo for the first time. He faces Sebastian Baez in his opener on Thursday and could meet Chengdu champion Alejandro Tabilo in the second round.

“I know it is a great tournament. I know the players who have played this tournament before and the players who have won this tournament before,” Alcaraz said. “I just really wanted to come here, play great tennis, perform well and try to win the trophy. That's why I'm here just to feel great on court, giving myself the chance to win the trophy to win the tournament.

“At the end of the week I just really want to put my name next to the past champions that I know it's an honor to be next to, to those names as well.”

Tokyo's honour roll includes all members of the Big Three — Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic — as well as Andy Murray, Pete Sampras, Stefan Edberg and Ivan Lendl, and many other greats of the sport.

Learner Tien, Dino Prizmic and Shang Juncheng all earned victories on the ATP Tour last week in Hangzhou and Chengdu, respectively, increasing their chances of playing at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, held from 17-21 December in Jeddah.

Tien cemented his third-placed position in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah with a quarter-final run at the ATP 250 hard-court event in Hangzhou. The 19-year-old American defeated Mariano Navone and Giulio Zeppieri before he lost to eventual finalist Valentin Royer. Tien is hoping to make his second appearance at the 20-and-under event after reaching the title match last year.

Fourth-placed Prizmic captured his third ATP Tour match win of the season at the event in Chengdu. The Croatian, who has lifted two ATP Challenger Tour trophies in 2025, defeated Cincinnati semi-finalist Terence Atmane and then pushed Top 10 star Lorenzo Musetti to three sets in the second round. Prizmic is aiming to make his debut in Jeddah.

China's Shang continued his comeback from injury with a first-round win against Zizou Bergs in Chengdu. The 20-year-old lefty returned to Tour at the end of July in Toronto after missing the first six months of the season due to a foot injury.

Shang is 18th in the Live Race To Jeddah and will need a couple of deep runs in the next eight weeks to move into qualification contention. This week, he is playing at the ATP 500 event in Beijing and opens against Arthur Cazaux.

Fifth-placed Alexander Blockx, sixth-placed Nicolai Budkov Kjaer and eighth-placed Martin Landaluce are in Challenger Tour action this week in Orleans, while seventh-placed Nishesh Basavareddy lost in the opening round of qualifying in Beijing.

“This project means a lot to me because it combines my experience as an athlete with the chance to genuinely support young talent,” Swiatek went on to write on her official website.“Tennis has made me recognizable, and with that I've gained the ability to influence issues that really matter to me. I want to use this opportunity to help make the world a better place—sometimes on a small scale, sometimes on a larger one. I can't help everyone who needs support, but I'll do everything I can, on and off the court, to make things at least a little better.""Meanwhile, Sinner's namesake foundation officially launched last Thursday with an event in Milan that was attended by 100 people. The Jannik Sinner Foundation will collaborate with the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), the world's largest fund dedicated to improving educational opportunities in lower-income countries, as well as Südtirol Sporthilfe, a non-profit that supports young athletes through funding, mentorship and development.

The world No. 2 vowed to be less “predictable” after suffering a four-set defeat to Carlos Alcaraz.ByDavid KanePublished Sep 24, 2025 copy_link

Jannik Sinner appears to be making good on his promise to become more unpredictable on the tennis court court, the former world No. 1 discussing changes to his practice repertoire in the wake of a 2025 US Open final defeat to Carlos Alcaraz.“We've been reflecting a lot to that final,” Sinner said in a pre-tournament press conference at this week's China Open. “We are working on new things. We are changing a lot of small things where I'm thinking of now.

It was a stark admission from the 24-year-old Italian who otherwise enjoyed a remarkable follow-up to his breakthrough 2024 season, winning two more Grand Slam trophies—including a first Wimbledon title over Alcaraz—and reaching the final of all four major tournaments in 2025. He also maintained a 65-week stretch atop the ATP rankings despite missing three months of tournaments due to a suspension for an anti-doping rule violation incurred last spring.Still, Sinner feels there's room for improvement, particularly against Alcaraz, who has become primary rival and leads their head-to-head, 9-5.“I'm trying to be more prepared for the next match what I will play against him,” Sinner said in New York. “It also, I feel like, depends how you arrive to play against Carlos. You know, one thing is when the scoreline, you know, matches before are comfortable but you always do the same things, like I did, for example, during this tournament, you know, I didn't make one serve-volley, didn't use a lot of drop shots, and then you arrive to a point where you play against Carlos where you have to go out of the comfort zone.”

Sinner is the top seed in Beijing, as Alcaraz has opted not to defend his title and instead compete at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships in Tokyo. The Italian will open against Marin Cilic in the first round.Might fans see a new Sinner on court against the 2014 US Open champion?“It's just a question of time,” Sinner said of his tactical tweaks. “Let's see how long I take it.

The updated lineup boasts improved comfort and stability without diminishing the frame's explosive power and spin-driven performance.ByJon LeveyPublished Sep 24, 2025 copy_link

Published Sep 24, 2025

Some racquet updates are addition by subtraction. The manufacturer determines that a technology or feature has overstayed its usefulness and pulling the plug will actullay improve the frame's performance. For the second iteration of its Blackout, Solinco opted to keep the racquet's foundation and to continue build out. The frame already had a solid base of power, but enhancements to its stability and feel would make it superior across the board.There are two main advancements intended to better the Blackout. The first is the addition of Foam Tech Core. Racquets in the Blackout's class—100 square-inch, thick tapered beam width—are typically hollow; as was the original version. However, the V2 has PU density foam filling the head of the frame to reduce vibrations for a more comfortable feel at impact.It's already a feature in the brand's thinner-beamed, more control-oriented Whiteout franchise, but the added thickness of the Blackout created challenges. The trick was to keep the same weight and specs while accounting for the extra mass of the foam needed to fill out the beam. Ultimately, Solinco believes it gives the frame a friendlier ride than many of its competitors.

The Blackout V2 has foam filling in the hoop for improved vibration dampening, comfort and feel

“We wanted to add that tech into the Blackout to dampen vibration and make it smoother,” says KT Kim, Director of Solinco Sports. “Generally speaking a lot of people are thinking of arm health with this type of stiffer racquet.”The other notable addition is Arch-2 Construction. Also in the Whiteout, it's a new architecture and carbon fiber layup that bolsters the frame's stability and responsiveness. It keeps the racquet composed when taking big cuts, fostering greater confidence when trying to put extra sizzle on shots or confronting faster ball speeds.The look of frame also gets a makeover, taking on a striking Tiger Camo paint job inspired by gaming skins. However, fans of the V1 should take heart that everything else returns. This includes 40T Carbon Fiber, Liquid Crystal Technology and the innovative Weight Control Module—interchangeable 5-gram and 10-gram butt-cap plates to fine-tune the racquet's weight and balance.“We feel it's now a racquet that can really be used across a wide spectrum of players,” says Kim. “Beginners to pros, it can handle heavy pace under fire and is an easier, more comfortable racquet to swing.”

Abbi Pulling reviews the Baku Grand Prix on The Cooldown Room

Race Recap: Azerbaijan

It was a point-less weekend for Kick Sauber drivers Gabriel Bortoleto and Nico Hulkenberg on the streets of Baku.

Gabriel Bortoleto chose to take the positives from his and Kick Sauber's performance at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, with the Brazilian rookie finishing one spot outside the points on what was always going to be a “tough” weekend.

Bortoleto and Sauber headed to the Baku City Circuit off the back of a strong Q3 showing and points finish at Monza, only for Q2 in Qualifying and a run to 11th place in the race – almost 30 seconds off Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar in 10th – to be the limit this time out.

While he missed out on making it five top-10 results in seven events, Bortoleto knew the unique nature of the tight, twisty street track was never going to play to the strengths of Sauber's C45 package.

Reflecting on his Sunday afternoon, he said: “Definitely an intense race, very close to the walls at all times – you need to keep your focus level very high the whole race.

“I'm happy that we finished the weekend without any damage on the car and that we delivered everything the car had available.

“I really don't think we could have finished P10 today. Hadjar finished in P10 and was [half a minute] ahead. It's just not a weekend for us that we had the pace to fight with them.”

Bortoleto added: “I'm quite convinced that we can perform in other weekends. We knew this was going to be a tough track for us. There are weekends where we can fight for it and weekends where we cannot, so it's fine.”

Bortoleto's team mate, Nico Hulkenberg, started the race in 17th after a Q1 exit and could only rise to 16th – having spent most of his day stuck behind Lance Stroll's Aston Martin.

Asked if early contact with Haas' Esteban Ocon compromised his race, Hulkenberg said: “No, not at all. That was just Lap 1 racing. I think neither of us had a problem after that.

“I just didn't get off to the best first lap, lost two or three positions. I got two back actually at the restart, a nice move into Turn 3, a double whammy – that was quite nice and rewarding.

“I had a long, long first stint behind Lance and unfortunately I couldn't get him. We lost a lot of race time there and that was make or break. Then obviously no Safety Car, nothing happening, so eventually pitted and came out far behind.

“I think the pace at the end was good, but obviously the damage was done yesterday already and early in the race. [I need to] try to be better and cleaner next time around.”

Sauber remain eighth in the Teams' Championship standings after Azerbaijan on 55 points, with Haas just behind on 44 and Aston Martin just ahead on 62.

Abbi Pulling reviews the Baku Grand Prix on The Cooldown Room

Race Recap: Azerbaijan

Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto have given their verdicts on what proved to be a tough weekend for Alpine at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.

Pierre Gasly conceded that the Azerbaijan Grand Prix was “painful” for the Alpine team, with the Frenchman stating that the squad had “absolutely no chance” after lacking pace throughout the weekend.

Having failed to score points since the Belgian Grand Prix back in July, Alpine again came away empty-handed in Baku. The Enstone-based outfit took a gamble by splitting strategies between Gasly and Franco Colapinto – starting the former on the hard compound and the latter on the soft – but the move ultimately did not move the pair forwards, leading to a P18 and P19 finish.

Reflecting on the race afterwards, a downbeat Gasly summed up the situation by admitting: “We've just got no pace here.”

In terms of the learnings that the team can take forward from the event – with one eye on preparing for 2026 – Gasly spoke of the importance of understanding why the A525 seemed to particularly struggle at the Baku City Circuit.

“The cars will be very different, I think,” the 29-year-old said. “I'm sure there's stuff we can learn because obviously it hasn't been good at all this weekend in terms of pace, and we've been slightly more competitive on other race tracks.

“This weekend we had absolutely no chance unfortunately, so there is fundamentally something on this track which we're not doing quite well and it's important to take the lessons from it.

“But, yeah, I must say it's a bit painful. It's painful for everyone, and I just think we've got to keep our head down and try to work together as a team and try to find a way to get better for next weekend.”

The Azerbaijan event was also tough for Colapinto, who was amongst those to crash in Saturday's Qualifying session. After lining up in P16, the Argentinian's afternoon was made more difficult when he was involved in a collision with Alex Albon, an incident that the Williams driver was handed a 10-second time penalty for.

“It was a tough day,” Colapinto conceded. “We didn't really have any pace today and we just really struggled with the car, with the pace, and we need to keep working to get better.

“Of course I lost a lot of time with the contact with Alex, 12 seconds I think, and then a broken front wing that gave me a lot of understeer [and a] flat spot. So it was tough, but we just had no pace and we need to get better at that.”

The 22-year-old added that the team would “try to get better” for the next race, with the Singapore Grand Prix being the next round on the calendar on the weekend of October 3-5.

Race Recap: Azerbaijan

Mark Hughes and illustrator Giorgio Piola delve into the factors that have given Red Bull a well-balanced car across recent races.

The Max Verstappen/Red Bull resurgence of the last two races has inevitably led to speculation about whether this winning form can be extended beyond just the outlying low-downforce demands of Monza and Baku.

Team boss Laurent Mekies was urging caution of that idea in Baku, saying: “The people back at the factory have been working so hard in trying to understand what has been limiting us with this car. We have been developing our understanding on this and this has been helping.

Done with the blessing of Major League Baseball, the collection spans apparel, accessories and equipment with a launch scheduled at select Kith stores and on the brand's website on Friday, Sept. 26.

	George Costanza is back with the New York Yankees.


Jason Alexander, who played the beloved curmudgeon on the iconic comedy series Seinfeld, has found himself a new role by headlining a campaign for Kith in partnership with the New York Yankees. Done with the blessing of Major League Baseball, the collection spans apparel, accessories and equipment with artwork in honor of the World Series champs. The line launches at select Kith stores and on the brand's website on Friday, Sept. 26.




	Kith founder and creative director Ronnie Fieg is a big sports fan and has previously partnered on other collections with the Yankees, the NFL and the New York Knicks in addition to other collaborations with Wilson, Adidas, Russell Athletic, Nike and more. The fashion house jump-started this new line by introducing collectible made-to-order printed bats featuring the Yankees logo made by Kith and Victus. Two natural bats retail for $245 while a Kith and Swarovski version retails for $5,000.

	Alexander is outfitted in apparel from the Kith for the New York Yankees line, a range that includes a coaches jacket, a pinehurst sherpa jacket, a Nelson crewneck, novelty outerwear with all-over logo patches and co-branded artwork, like on a corduroy avery bomber jacket, the brixton puffed shirt jacket, and the wyona full-zip. Also included are classic hoodies, pullovers and sweatshirts.

	Alexander also models a flight jacket done in partnership with Avirex, available in three iterations, including one with all-over Cooperstown collective patchwork and embroidery with each World Series Championship year, another designed in Kith's staple nocturnal hue with python-printed accents, and one designed in the Yankees team colors with genuine MLB logo artwork.


	See a selection of the pieces on Alexander in the new campaign below. Seinfeld fans will remember that Alexander's Costanza landed a dream job with the team during season five, as he was hired as the assistant to the traveling secretary. He wound up having a long tenure with the team, which was featured prominently through season eight, as Costanza regularly appeared in his office and around George Steinbrenner, played by the show's co-creator Larry David.

“We're not aligned on the decision to pause the release,” Chastain wrote on Instagram, adding that she hopes it receives a release date soon.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


Jessica Chastain, the star of the Apple TV+ series The Savant, said Wednesday that she does not agree with the platform's decision to postpone its release.


	Apple said Tuesday that it made the decision to postpone the thriller after “careful consideration.” The political undertones of the show, which sees Chastain star as a top-secret undercover investigator, nicknamed “The Savant,” who infiltrates online hate groups and takes them down from the inside, may have been deemed inappropriate in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination earlier this month.

	“I want to say how much I value my partnership with Apple. They've been incredible collaborators and I deeply respect their team,” Chastain wrote. “That said, I wanted to reach out and let you know that we're not aligned on the decision to pause the release of The Savant. 


	“In the last five years since we've been making the show, we've seen an unfortunate amount of violence in the United States: the kidnapping attempt on Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer; the January 6th attack on the Capitol; the assassination attempts on President Trump; the political assassinations of Democratic representatives in Minnesota; the attack on Speaker Pelosi's husband; the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk; the recent shooting at an ABC affiliate station in California; and over 300 school shootings across this country,” she continued. “These incidents, though far from encompassing the full range of violence witnessed in the United States, illustrate a broader mindset that crosses the political spectrum and must be confronted. I've never shied away from difficult subjects, and while I wish this show wasn't so relevant, unfortunately it is. The Savant is about the heroes who work every day to stop violence before it happens, and honoring their courage feels more urgent than ever. While I respect Apple's decision to pause the release for now, I remain hopeful the show will reach audiences soon. Until then, I'm wishing safety and strength for everyone, and I'll let you know if and when The Savant is released.”

	











The Savant was supposed to premiere Sep. 26, with new episodes rolling out weekly. For now, Apple only says that it will be released “at a later date.”

Fresh off its IPO, the indie disruptor is betting big on global audiences. But its values-based playbook may not translate everywhere.


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	Barely a week since Angel Studios rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange, and the faith-friendly disruptor is still basking in the glow of its high-profile debut and feeling the heat that comes with it. The Utah-based studio behind Sound of Freedom has gone from a family-run outsider operation to a $1.6 billion public company in less than a decade. Its rise reflects not only the strength of a niche market hungry for values-driven storytelling but also the new pressures of proving that a homespun model can scale under Wall Street's unforgiving gaze. It comes as the studio has expanded internationally, striking distribution agreements across Europe, Latin America, and Asia in an effort to prove its grassroots, faith-friendly business model can resonate worldwide.

	Angel's secret weapon has been its 1.5 million-strong “Angel Guild,” paying members who double as financiers and gatekeepers, voting on which projects make it to screens, as well as providing Kickstarter-style capital investments and a “pay-it-forward” booking system that allows people to buy and then donate movie tickets to Angel Studios releases for others to use.




	“Rather than having a couple dozen people make all the decisions about every movie that goes out, I can't take a movie into the studio and stream it or take it to theaters unless the guild passes it,” chief content officer Jeffrey Harmon explained, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in June, ahead of its IPO.


	That grassroots democracy has delivered some startling wins, including the $250 million global success of Sound of Freedom and The King of Kings, a South Korean-produced animated hit about the life of Jesus, which has grossed more than $70 million worldwide. Media analyst Evan Shapiro estimates that from 2023 to 2025, Angel's releases averaged $34.7 million per title, outpacing indie rivals like A24.

	











	Angel's pitch to investors is that audiences in middle America, the same group that Taylor Sheridan tapped to create his Yellowstone television empire, will flock to faith-friendly movies that embrace a more conservative worldview.


	“Angel is a response to Hollywood gatekeepers being out of touch,” says Angel CEO and co-founder. “We have flipped the model, empowering our 1.5 million Angel Guild members to be virtual co-producers, deciding what values-driven film and television shows get made and distributed. While we are encouraged by the early response to the power of our new model, we are focused on building lasting value over the long term.”


	But the company's bold approach comes with obvious risks. Angel has yet to turn a profit. In the first half of 2025, it booked $135 million in revenue but still posted a $53.3 million loss. The company has attributed much of its spending to efforts to expand its Angel Guild membership base, though detailed breakdowns of marketing costs are not publicly available. Just ahead of its listing, Angel raised $55 million from more than 40,000 individual investors and secured a $100 million credit facility with Trinity Capital. According to summaries of its filings, Angel has also used high-interest debt and other financing arrangements tied to revenue streams such as Sound of Freedom. These moves provided the studio with growth capital, but also raised questions about potential dilution, leverage, and the durability of its financial runway.

	











	The international expansion adds another layer of uncertainty. Whether Angel's blend of evangelical-inspired hits and broader family fare can travel beyond its U.S. base remains an open question. “Europe is a more secular market generally,” Harmon admitted to THR, but noted he sees strong growth potential in territories like Brazil, which boasts a more faith-focused audience. “They embrace the faith films more so than even the U.S. does.”


	The company has already partnered with Brazil's largest faith-based distributors for theatrical rollouts, inked a slate deal with U.K.-based distributor Kova for a pipeline of titles, and secured streaming and theatrical partnerships across Latin America. Angel has also pursued selective distribution agreements in Asia, including South Korea — home to a large Christian community — where The King of Kings became a local hit before expanding globally. These deals show Angel adapting to territory-specific partners, but also highlight the challenge of tailoring its model to vastly different cultural markets.


	The studio has also run into friction with creatives. A bitter arbitration battle over The Chosen ended with Angel losing rights to its biggest series (Angel is appealing), and a lawsuit with Slingshot, producer of the animated feature David, is ongoing. Angel president Jordan Harmon has previously waved off the disputes, noting that lawsuits in the entertainment industry are “like pigeons in New York City. It's just the reality of this space.”

	











	Despite those bumps, Angel is charging ahead. The studio has teed up The Senior, a sports drama starring Michael Chiklis as a 59-year-old who returns to college to play football, and Zero A.D., a biblical thriller from Sound of Freedom director Alejandro Monteverde, starring Sam Worthington, Ben Mendelsohn, Gael García Bernal and Jim Caviezel. Its 2026 slate includes Young Washington, a George Washington origin story timed to hit theaters next summer during America's 250th anniversary celebrations.


	Angel Studios shares, trading under ticker symbol ANGX, have dropped from around $13 after going as high as $20.39 and as low as $4.52. On Tuesday, the stock had closed at $5. 


	Given the current cultural moment, Angel Studios' IPO looks particularly fortuitous. But Wall Street's memory is short, and overseas audiences, which have proven resistant to patriotic American fare — James Gunn's Superman being a case in point — may prove harder to proselytize. Barely a week into its life as a public company, Angel has shown it can light a spark. The question is whether that spark can sustain a flame big enough to keep both its faithful backers and its new investors believing.

Kimmel's emotional and highly anticipated return to ABC is racking up views and should soon become the most popular 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' monologue on YouTube. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


Nexstar and Sinclair really missed out. 


	The affiliate groups boycotting Jimmy Kimmel Live! missed airing — and selling ads — on what could become Jimmy Kimmel's most-watched monologue in many years, if not ever. 




Kimmel's return to ABC on Tuesday night (watch the video, below) featured a nearly 30-minute show opening that included the host's emotional monologue where he thanked those who supported him during his suspension, attempted to clarify his controversial comments about Charlie Kirk and, most of all, passionately defended free speech.

					Jimmy Kimmel Returns With Gratitude for Supporters, Barbs for ""Anti-American"" Calls to Silence Him		
			









	So far, the show's official YouTube account has clocked the monologue video at 13 million views in just 14 hours. Kimmel has many short clips from his show of sketches and guest interview segments that have racked up tens of millions of clicks over the years, but Tuesday night's monologue is looking like it might set a record in terms of opening monologue videos.


	Kimmel's current most-watched opening monologue is from another sober occasion — Kimmel discussing the details of his son's birth and heart disease from eight years ago. That has 14 million views. In second place currently is Kimmel's break down of the Will Smith Oscars slap from three years ago. Other popular monologues include Kimmel discussing the 2017 mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas (10 million views), and Kimmel reacting to President Trump's election last November (9 million views).

	











	Given that Kimmel's latest is averaging about 1 million views an hour, it certainly seems likely that last night's opening will soon break the host's monologue record. 


	On ABC, Kimmel typically draws about 1.6 million viewers, but according to The New York Times, the network is expecting to generate far more than that in the official ratings— even with the Nexstar and Sinclair boycotts, which account for roughly 20 percent of the network's stations.


	Kimmel's monologue is largely being hailed as meeting the moment. While he stopped just short of apologizing for his comments about Kirk — something many on the right were demanding — he attempted to reach out to his detractors by thanking the many conservatives who criticized the Trump administration's efforts to push him off the air, as well as gave very sincere-sounding praise to Kirk's widow Erika Kirk, and expressed some hope for some measure of increased bipartisan unity in the wake of recent events.


	“Look, I never imagined I would be in a situation like this,” Kimmel said. “I barely paid attention in school. One thing I did learn from from Lenny Bruce and George Carlin and Howard Stern, is that a government threat to silence a comedian the President doesn't like is anti American. So I'm glad we have some solidarity on that from the right and left and from those in the middle — like Joe Rogan. Maybe the silver lining from this is we found one thing we can agree on … Let's stop letting these politicians tell us what they want and tell them what we want.”

	











	For more, here's a recap of Kimmel's comments and a Hollywood Reporter‘s critic's take on the monologue.

As one of the entertainment news show's brightest stars, Evans opens his home to host a bevy of stars from Regina King to Cynthia Erivo for food, drinks, laughter and revelatory conversations. 


							By 

	Chris Gardner



	Side hustles can be hard for hosts. Their on-camera jobs typically require long hours, lots of preparation, frequent travel and back-to-back shoots or red carpet events, leaving little spare time.


	But somehow Scott Evans, the well-liked and long-serving host of Access Hollywood, found a way to make his work in Webby Award-winning ways as a domestic extension of his day job. Evans created the digital interview show House Guest by inviting celebrities and notable names over to his actual home for a backyard hang that features all the trappings of a lively gathering, like food, drinks, games and honest conversations.

	“We've been hosting lunches, brunches and dinners at the house for a while so I decided to gather people in a meaningful way, create a safe place where people can really be comfortable and then capture it on camera,” explained the Indiana native. “We make something to eat, something to drink and then we chop it up. You might get to see them in a whole new light or confirm even more why you love them in the first place while also hearing about some of the best lessons they've learned.”

House Guest, which celebrated a one-year anniversary over the summer, has hosted the likes of Oscar winner Regina King, Keke Palmer, Tony winner Cynthia Erivo, Emmy winner Niecy Nash-Betts, Saturday Night Live star Leslie Jones, Aisha Tyler, Tina Knowles, Amber Riley, Chloe Bailey, Meagan Good, Muni Long, Taye Diggs and more. Evans' audience seems to be loving the view into his backyard as the clips receive millions of views and no shortage of loving comments. “Scott's channel feels like visiting your favorite cousin's house,” someone recently posted on YouTube. That's exactly what Evans was going for when he bet on himself to self-finance the operation and leaned on his entertainment contacts to book bold-faced names for lengthy chats outside of his Access Hollywood day-to-day.

	











	He's just about to drop his biggest interview yet with vice president Kamala Harris, who swung by his home for a news-making conversation (over her favorite pizza, which Evans made special) about her presidential bid, the new memoir 107 Days and what's next for her outside of Washington D.C. Ahead of the interview drop on Thursday, Evans hopped on the phone with The Hollywood Reporter to talk about his preparation, his revelations and whether or not Rihanna is on the RSVP list. 


What pushed you to launch this in the first place?


	I was ready for more of the kinds of conversations I was already having with talent but that weren't making it into the final piece on air either due to story count, timing, editorial focus, that kind of thing. There's a lot of magic left on the cutting room floor. A lot of the content that feels uplifting, encouraging and joy-filled isn't always at the forefront, and so I wanted to do something that felt very me. I also wanted to create something that harkened back to the greats that could be one part Ina Garten's Barefoot Contessa and one part Arsenio Hall. I wanted to create that space, especially because there are fewer and fewer of these types of opportunities, especially for people of color to be highlighted. How can we get more in control of that content and get it in front of people who are longing for it? And how can we put a positive spin on it as opposed to the more dramatic or mess that is already out there?


I didn't even think of that, but yeah, it does have a tone unlike other shows that are so popular online now because they can be messy or dramatic for the sake of going viral. House Guest really matches who you are as a human being …












	And it matches the kinds of conversations that I already have, whether it's with a celebrity or with a young person in the industry who is coming into their own and wants to glean something from an executive or a veteran in the industry. I was always looking for guidance from people, asking, “How are you making it through this?” “What are you leaning on?” “What are the things you do that make this situation bearable?” I wanted to be able to create a space for people to feel comfortable to share experiences and to just feel better about our days.

A post shared by Scott Evans (@iamscottevans)


What kind of host are you?


	I seek to create the kind of space where everybody feels like it's their house. Come over and get super comfortable. Come in sweats or designer wares, whatever is most comfortable, but come ready to have a good time. What I learned in my years of doing interviews on Access Hollywood is that if you mean to create a space where someone is going to offer some part of themselves in a way they haven't before or they're going to speak on a subject that they otherwise haven't, you have to be prepared to share yourself. We are in no way, shape or form trying to make anyone look bad or crazy or emotional, nothing like that. I'm also willing to share just as much as they are.


Is there an interview you found most revelatory, either from the guest or yourself?


	We did an interview early on with Andra Day, and so many people were in the comments surprised that she was not a British woman and that she's a Black woman. This is a woman who won a Golden Globe for playing Billie Holiday but her backstory for some reason was not getting across to the audience. The House Guest interview allowed people to see her in a totally different way in all of her Andra Day glory. We bonded over the shared parts of ourselves, our inability to sometimes stay focused on what's in front of us and we just went with the conversation where it was supposed to go.

	











How is your preparation for these interviews compared to your day job?


	It's a little bit more intense because it's on my own. When you're working for an entertainment news organization, there are “must get” topics, or relevant news questions. But with this, I can go wherever I want to go, as long as it is appropriate or well-received with the guest. It's been great to have the opportunity to dive into parts of someone's story that are new or that are interesting. I'm thinking about Michael Evans Behling, who talked for the first time about his adoption journey. While some people may have known he was adopted by members of his family, they might not have known the circumstances or details. He shared openly and honestly about that without me having to prod or inquire because he felt ready to share that part of himself. Every once in a while as talent walks out of the room after an interview is over, their publicist or assistant will say to me, “I don't know how you got them to talk about that. They've never said that before on camera.” 


	When Regina King came on, she opened up about her son and memorializing her son to the world. But she was also processing for the first time on camera, how much she wanted to share. In the middle of it, she said, “I was unprepared for what I would share.” There were things she may not have wanted to talk about but within 15 minutes, we were talking about all of it. She thanked me for taking such good care of guests and for being someone to depend on and lean into with tough subject matter. I did my very best. But there was a moment when she looked at me and said, “There are moments, Scott, when you remind me of Ian, and it's a really beautiful thing.” I lost it. I lost it. 

	











Wow. That's a testament to who you are, your integrity and skill as an interviewer, which is evident across your many, many interviews. What else has been key to your success?


	There are so many mixed messages out there, especially on social media, about who you are, who you can't be, who you'll never be, what you need to change in order to achieve this or that before it's too late. So much of it is counting you out when you've already done that to yourself. So for me, I stopped listening to music or any other messages like that when I'm driving around L.A. for work because it sometimes made me arrive to my location [in a hyped up way] like I was ready for the club or for some other kind of feeling. I've found that managing my environment while I commute has brought about a real shift that translates into my work. It feels easier, more real. 


What are you listening to when you're driving across town?


	If I'm about to have a guest on, I'm listening to their audiobook or their work. I just blasted through one of Chelsea Handler's books, Life Will Be the Death of Me. I've told so many friends about the subject matter and energy of her books. I re-read Michelle Obama's Becoming, Jenifer Lewis's The Mother of Black Hollywood: A Memoir. Viola Davis's Finding Me: A Memoir and Whoopi Goldberg's Bits and Pieces: My Mother, My Brother, and Me. Game-changers, game-changers. I love hearing from people, in their words, what helped them in their lives, how they overcame pitfalls or shortcomings, because it helps me navigate my own.

	











Any other personal highlights from people you've had on House Guest over the past year?


	Yes, sometimes it's not people who are the most famous or doing the splashiest work but I know they will be people that we will look back on years from now, like, “damn.” Diarra Kilpatrick from Diarra From Detroit. She was a fantastic episode, which had everything from the heartfelt to the hilarious to the tragic. That describes so many of our stories and it felt very real. Also the Keke Palmer episode because she said, “Whatever we got to do to make it happen, I'm coming to sit with my guy. I see all of my friends with my guy. He's my guy.” She creates these moments, that while marvelous, hit you dead in your heart. I got to hear her talk about the decision to own her story so that someone else couldn't, her decision to protect her own narrative, and it was something I've never seen or heard her talk about before, certainly not in that way. 


Hearing you say “my guy,” I have to ask about Rihanna. Every interview I've seen, her face lights up when she sees you. It's a different energy. I can't put words in Rihanna's mouth but it feels like, to me, that you are her guy, too. I imagine that she's a dream House Guest guest?


	I already told her that if we have to come to her, we'll do a guest house House Guest. When I learned that my father's heritage went further back than Panama, to Barbados, I shared that with her kind of in the moment, almost on accident. And she meant what she said when she offered, “I'll take you back.” I didn't say anything because we were still on camera but within days, her team called to say, “Are you packed?” I was like, “For what?” But we went, and I've since been back three times. I've taken my mom and brothers to Barbados to show them their heritage and our connections to that island. We're now at a point considering if we should have a place there that we own to really make this a part of our story in a meaningful way. I'll never forget that about Rihanna.

	











Let's talk money. You finance this operation by yourself. Why and how expensive is it?


	It's a lot. Each episode is quite a bit. We've been fortunate here lately to work with brand partners that really believe in the work that we're doing. They've released the reins to help us create the show we want to create without too much interference on messaging because they really get it. It's also been a dream to win a Webby Award [for Interview, Talk & After-Show, Series and Channels]. That was unreal.


	So how do I say this? The cost of the show is not nothing, but we spend what it takes to make sure that it's a show at the level that it needs to be. It also feels like an interruption from the majority of clips coming across your timeline. When you see our YouTube thumbnail, it stops you and helps you feel that you're right there with us. And that's not cheap. But every watch matters. Every comment matters. Every share matters. 


You've passed the one-year mark, won a Webby and keep landing big-name guests. How long do you plan on keeping House Guest open for business?


	We're in it for the long haul. House Guest is just one of the ideas that we have about projects that we'd like to do, shows that encourage, uplift, entertain, put smiles on people's faces. We're developing projects in the sports space, other formats. Keke Palmer was dead serious when she said that we should do a variety show by bringing our friends and fellow performers together to do something really cool. Some companies have already expressed interest in helping us develop that and getting it across the finish line. House Guest isn't going anywhere but stay tuned because there's much more to come.

	











Aside from Rihanna, who is a dream guest?


	Rihanna, first and foremost. But also the Obamas. I'm curious to see what they would be like in this format, especially after the launch of Michelle and her brother's podcast. To be included in the Ebony 100 alongside them was nuts, to be honest. But the reality is that I can't answer this question without saying the big three — Beyoncé, Rihanna and Lady Gaga. At any point, ladies, come over. The invitation is open.

The four-time Grammy-nominated singer, songwriter and producer speaks with The Hollywood Reporter about his creative process and no. 1 songwriting essential: ""I take it everywhere I go.""

	Peel back Charlie Puth‘s perfect pitch, nine multi-platinum singles and 35 billion+ career streams, and you've got a guy who wholeheartedly lives and breathes music.


	The singer, songwriter and producer catches up with The Hollywood Reporter about what he's been working on, life on the go (he travels back and forth between Los Angeles and New York) and his very fitting partnership with Bic pens (he handwrites all his lyrics). He also breaks down his creative process, backstage must-haves and what he's most looking forward to in the coming months (hint: it involves new music).

Let's jump right in. Tell me about your songwriting process. Is it always the same or different based on where you are in life or what you're writing?


	I mean, it's different everywhere because life is different every day. I'll write different sounding music based on the location. I remember writing “We Don't Talk Anymore” in the Philippines, and it was a very hot day. It was probably 100 degrees… Fahrenheit, not Celsius (Laughs). I saw palm trees, and I thought to myself very simply, “I'm going to make a song that feels like vacation, sounds like vacation.” This is before the lyrics were written, of course.


	And then, “Light Switch,” the song I put out in 2022, was a result of me just being locked in the studio because of post-COVID times, and I wanted something upbeat and fast to kind of get me going because nothing at that point in time was. I wanted to make something that excited me.


Can you elaborate on your physical writing process?


	I handwrite lyrics. I never type lyrics on my phone or a computer. It just feels like the song isn't a song if I type it in — it needs my personality. It's just something mental. Bic produces a product that I literally use every day of my life to make music: the 4-Color Pen. The different colors will trigger different parts of my musical mind. So I take it on tour. I take it on airplanes. I take it everywhere I go. If I don't like a lyric, I'm going to use the color red to scratch it out. Red's bad. Green's my favorite color. Green means go. That's usually a good lyric.

	











Other than your pen, what are your must-have travel items?


	I'm a really basic traveler. Bose headphones. I have my iPad. I have my neck pillow. And there's this little pocket synthesizer by Teenage Engineering that I use. I've never recorded with it, but it's just like little blips and bleeps… I draft what could be ideas on it.


Side note: I just noticed that your Zoom name is “MusicRocks1991.”


	Yeah, you can write that in the article too because music does rock.


I'm fully writing that in the article. OK, so we did travel, but do you have any backstage essentials?


	Several notebooks and pens. I have to have a little keyboard backstage as well because I feel like sometimes I can't talk. And if I have to meet a couple of people before I go on stage, I'll just sit behind the little keyboard and play stuff as I'm talking and I feel like the words will come out easier. It actually helps me converse better. I don't know what's wrong with me.


That's such a creative person thing to say.


	Yes. I've heard people describe me as creative. (Laughs.)


What would you say is the best piece of advice you've ever received that you would give to an aspiring artist?


	Best piece of advice I ever received was to not overthink things. Don't re-sing the vocal a bunch of times. Don't rewrite the script. Just whatever your gut is, do it. Multiple people that I've looked up to have told me that, and that's what I would continue to spread.


How do you know when you're done with a song?












	That's a good question. When there's nothing left to add to the song, or when you try to add things and it doesn't change it at all. There's a song I wrote called “That's Hilarious” in 2022, and it's a very simple production, and I was listening back to it thinking to myself, “this is too simple; it needs a guitar.” I add it. It feels out of place. “Okay, well, it doesn't need a guitar. Maybe it needs another hi-hat.” I add it. It feels weird. It feels awkward now. When I take it out, it felt much better. I guess, when you start to add things in and it feels like the cup's been filled, that's how you know when you're done with the song.


What else are you working on right now? What are you excited about in the coming months?


	I'm excited about music in general. I can't share when, but I do plan on putting music out soon. And when it does come out, I feel like a lot of question marks are going to be answered. [There will be] a lot of things that I haven't sung about. Life for me is much different than it was 10 years ago when “One Call Away” or “See You Again” came out, so there's some things to say.


	And I am constantly inspired by my surroundings, both musically and otherworldly, and I just, I hope I get to do this for the rest of my life.

The new case comes after the star was acquitted on criminal sex-trafficking charges and just weeks before he's sentenced on lesser prostitution convictions.

Sean “Diddy” Combs is facing a new civil abuse lawsuit from his longtime stylist Deonte Nash, months after the ex-employee testified against the hip hop mogul at his criminal trial.


	In a case submitted Wednesday in a Los Angeles court, Deonte Nash accuses Combs of assault, sexual battery and other wrongdoing – the latest of dozens of such lawsuits filed against Diddy since abuse claims first surfaced in 2023.


	The case from Nash, who also served as a stylist to Combs' longtime girlfriend and alleged abuse victim Cassie Ventura, comes after he testified at the star's blockbuster criminal trial in May, and less than two weeks before the star will be sentenced for his convictions on prostitution charges.


	“Though defendants have silenced him for years, Mr. Nash is no longer willing to give in to this fear for his life and is now standing up to demand justice,” his lawyers write in the court filings.

	In his lengthy complaint, Nash says Combs turned his dream of working as a celebrity stylist “into a nightmare that he was forced to endure nearly every single day” for the ten years he worked for the star from 2008 to 2018.


	“Combs … subjected Mr. Nash to a decade of sexual and physical assault, sexual and verbal harassment, trafficking, degradation and humiliation, threats to his life and well-being, stalking, control, and psychological manipulation,” his lawyers write. “Combs used his power and threats of harm to compel Mr. Nash to do his bidding and prevent him from leaving defendants' control.”


	At a party in “2013 or 2014,” Nash says the star exposed his penis and moved closer to him until the stylist told him to stop. During another alleged incident in 2016, Nash says Diddy grabbed his hand and forced him to touch his penis. In yet another incident in 2018, he says the star “grinded” on his genitals in a “sexually-charged” way: “Mr. Nash felt violated and offended by this unwanted sexual touching.”


	The lawsuit also claims Diddy subjected Nash to physical violence, as well as “unreasonable demands and expectations” as his stylist. He says he eventually had “no other choice” but to resign in 2018, but that Combs then “continued to threaten Mr. Nash after his employment ended.”


	In a statement to Billboard on Wednesday, Diddy's attorney Erica Wolff called Nash “another opportunist looking to profit off his proximity to celebrity” who had filed a lawsuit that was “riddled with falsehoods.”


	“Mr. Nash's tabloid-style accusations are insulting not only to Mr. Combs but also to the countless individuals who worked honorably and professionally within his companies,” Wolff said. “In court, the truth will prevail, as it did in his criminal trial: that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone—adult or minor, man or woman. Mr. Combs looks forward to clearing his name again in a court of law where truth matters.”


	Combs was arrested and charged in September 2024 with racketeering (RICO) and sex trafficking violations over accusations that he ran a sprawling criminal operation aimed at facilitating freak-offs — elaborate events in which he allegedly forced Ventura and other women to have sex with male escorts while he watched and masturbated.


	At his blockbuster trial this spring, Nash took the witness stand for the prosecution, telling jurors he had seen Diddy physically abuse Ventura and threaten to release sex tapes of her if she didn't do what he demanded.


	But when the verdict was handed down, jurors largely cleared Combs, acquitting him on the core RICO and sex trafficking charges that could have seen him sentenced to prison for life. He was convicted only on two lesser counts of transporting Ventura and others across state lines for prostitution.


	Combs is set for sentencing on those convictions on Oct. 3. His lawyers asked the judge Monday to sentence him to 14 months in prison — a sentence that would see him released almost immediately on time served.


	But even if he's released quickly, Diddy is facing dozens of cases like Nash's, accusing him of rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment and various other forms of sexual abuse. Several have been dismissed in recent months, including one case filed by Making the Band 2 contestant Sara Rivers and another case by a John Doe plaintiff, but many others remain pending.

A woman claims Metro sexually assaulted her in 2016, while the producer calls the case a ""shakedown"" she concocted while high on ayahuasca.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



The trial has just begun in a rape lawsuit against Metro Boomin – but attorneys for the superstar producer's alleged victim are asking for a mistrial, saying a defense lawyer made improper claims about her sexual history during opening arguments.


	A jury in Los Angeles federal court heard opening arguments on Tuesday (Sept. 23) for the civil case brought by Vanessa LeMaistre, who alleges she blacked out after ingesting Xanax and alcohol in Metro Boomin's studio during a 2016 recording session and later woke up to the producer (Leland Wayne) raping her.


	Metro denies the claims, saying the case is a “classic celebrity shakedown” that LeMaistre concocted while hallucinating on ayahuasca. He has always maintained that their 2016 sexual encounter was consensual – but lawyers for LeMaistre say Metro's team went too far during opening statements on Tuesday by arguing that the two had also had consensual sex before that night at the recording studio.


	In all sexual violence trials, there are strict rules that limit the defense from alluding to an alleged victim's sexual history or apparent proclivities. Typically, a defendant needs to ask permission from the judge before bringing up any sexual conduct that is not tied to the specific incident at issue in a trial.


	LeMaistre's attorneys – led by Michael Willemin of the powerhouse plaintiff's firm Wigdor – say in a mistrial motion filed late on Tuesday that Metro's lawyers did not properly seek judicial approval before making these statements about their prior sexual history (which LeMaistre denies).


	“If plaintiff's counsel was provided fair warning and a [hearing] was held, the claim that plaintiff engaged in consensual sex with the defendant prior to the sexual assault would have been precluded,” Willemin writes. “And, even if the court made the determination that the claim of consensual sex pre-dating the sexual assault was far more probative than prejudicial, plaintiff would have known such information was going to be permitted and would certainly have addressed it in plaintiff's opening statement.”


	Willemin says there's “no possible way to undo” the prejudice that Metro's opening caused, since jurors cannot unhear this statement. He's asking Judge R. Gary Klausner to declare a mistrial and start the whole case over again.


	Judge Klausner will likely address this issue before the trial is set to resume on Wednesday (Sept. 24). Metro's lawyers from the firm Sanders Roberts did not immediately return a request for comment on the matter.


	LeMaistre sued Metro in 2024, claiming she met the producer in Las Vegas in the spring of 2016. LeMaistre says she confided in Metro about the recent death of her 9-month-old son, and that they “bonded over the ability of music to help people in their darkest moments.”


	But LeMaistre's belief about her bond with Metro allegedly “shattered” the following September, when the producer invited her to watch him work in his California recording studio. LeMaistre says she had a shot of alcohol and half a tablet of Xanax, then blacked out, waking up on a bed in a different location “completely unable to move or make a sound” while Metro raped her.


	LeMaistre alleges she became pregnant as a result of the assault and had an abortion in November 2016. Notably, the lawsuit claims the attack is referenced in Metro's 2017 song “Rap Saved Me” with Offset, 21 Savage and Quavo.


	The lyrics in question, rapped by 21 Savage and Offset in the chorus, are: “She took a Xanny, then she fainted/ I'm from the gutter, ain't no changing/ From the gutter, rap saved me/ She drive me crazy, have my baby.”


	The lyrical reference in LeMaistre's lawsuit is surprising, since Metro is a music producer and songwriter but does not typically write lyrics or rap himself. Metro has denied writing the “Rap Saved Me” lyrics, as well as the rest of LeMaistre's allegations.


	Metro's position is that LeMaistre has transformed a consensual sexual encounter into a false tale of rape in order to squeeze money out of him. He's focused heavily on LeMaistre journal entries from when she was high on ayahuasca in 2024, in which she detailed a “plan” to sue Metro for more than $3 million.


	The issue of ayahuasca took center stage when LeMaistre testified in court on Tuesday following opening statements. According to a report by independent journalist Meghann Cuniff, LeMaistre insisted from the witness stand that she did not hallucinate on the drug. Rather, said LeMaistre, the ayahuasca merely helped her come to terms with the fact that her nonconsensual sex with Metro had been rape.


	Metro himself is due to testify during the trial, which is slated to last four days total.

Sanchez cranked up the drama and the action, with a performance of ""Die With A Smile"" by Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars.

	Lars Brandle



	Jessica Sanchez is the extraordinary comeback kid of America's Got Talent. And just maybe, the champion of season 20. 


	The Texas native has a life story that could've been a script written for reality TV. She auditioned for the first season of America's Got Talent back in 2006, when she herself was a child. Now, performing in the finals of AGT 2025, she's nine months pregnant with a daughter of her own.


	On Tuesday night's (Sept. 23) finale, Sanchez cranked up the drama and the action, with a performance of “Die With A Smile” by Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars. Wearing a delicate all-white ensemble, Sanchez was all power and precision, her performance triggering fireworks, confetti and a standing ovation from a full house.

	When she auditioned by singing Benson Boone's “Beautiful Things,” Sanchez blew away the judges and scored Sofía Vergara's golden buzzer, sending her immediately to the live round of the competition.

	Naturally, Vergara spoke first, and enthusiastically, about Sanchez's chances of winning the $1 million prize. “It's perfection,” she remarked after the singer's final performance. “You look like a little pregnant angel. I mean you look beautiful, your voice, I've never heard anything like that. Bravo Jessica.”




	With every performance, remarked Mel B, “you kind of bring us into your world. You give us more emotion, more passion.” And no matter the song, Sanchez's “vocals are just flawless and pitch perfect, every single time.” Sanchez stuck with the script, noted the Spice Girl, by not delivering her baby before the finale.


	Howie Mandel wasn't thrilled with Sanchez's previous choice of song, but he had no qualms this time. “So far this is the best act of the night,” he declared.


	Simon Cowell, as he so often does, was last to offer his insights. “I felt there was an extra 10% from you, from before,” he explained. “Actually, there are two of you. So it's like a duo.” Having Sanchez return for the 20th anniversary of AGT was “so important,” he continued, “to show that even if you don't win the first time, you've got to always believe in yourself, right. And that's what you've done.” The arrangement was “beautiful” and Sanchez, he remarked, “sounded amazing” and delivered perhaps her best performance yet.


	Now America decides. 


	The season's final episode follows on Wednesday night, Sept. 24, featuring performances from past acts, and, of course, the announcement of the big winner. Watch from 9pm ET on NBC and streaming on Peacock.

	For a band that has not released a proper new song in 16 years, any fresh Oasis content is like manna from heaven for the band's die-hard fans. Especially if it's a refresh of one of their all-time classics.


	On Wednesday morning (Sept. 24) the reunited Britpop icons dropped “Morning Glory (Unplugged),” a thrilling, stripped-down version of the title track from their 1995 sophomore album, (What's the Story) Morning Glory? The song, which appears on the upcoming (What's the Story) Morning Glory? 30th anniversary deluxe edition (Oct. 3), was produced and mixed by guitarist/songwriter Noel Gallagher and Callum Marinho from the original master recordings at Noel's London studio, Lone Star Sound. 

	











	The acoustic guitar and tambourine jam puts the focus directly on singer Liam Gallagher's urgent vocals until a mid-song piano break that adds a jazzy interlude to the otherwise driving, stripped-down arrangement. At press time no information was available on when the unplugged version was recorded or who performs on it.




			Trending on Billboard		







	In addition to the title track refresh, the 30th anniversary Morning Glory edition will feature unplugged versions of four other classics from the album, including “Cast No Shadow,” “Wonderwall,” “Champagne Supernova” and the previously released live favorite B-side “Acquiesce.”

	











	After a triumphant North American swing, Oasis will continue their sold-out reunion tour at London's Wembley Stadium on Saturday (Sept. 27) and Sunday (Sept. 28), returning to the famed venue where they played to more than 400,000 over a five-night stand in July and early August.


	The tour will then move on to a series of shows in South Korea and Japan in late October before a run of five concerts in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia and a wind-down series of November gigs in Buenos Aires, Argentina and São Paulo, Brazil.

Black and Blue marked a turning point for the band following the departure of former guitarist Mick Taylor, who was eventually replaced by Ronnie Wood. As the band searched for Taylor's replacement, they brought a series of guitar greats in to perform on the LP, including Canned Heat guitarist Harvey Mandel, songwriter and session great Wayne Perkins, as well as Yardbirds wiz Jeff Beck and Memphis blues guitarist Robert A. Johnson.

	Wood would later join the band full-time, appearing on three tracks on the Billboard 200 album chart-topping LP, which mixes reggae, funk and soul into the Stones' signature mix on songs including “Hot Stuff,” “Fool to Cry,” “Memory Motel” and “Melody.”

	











	The box set will feature a six-track disc of previously unreleased songs, including Mick Jagger/Keith Richards composition “I Love Ladies,” a cover of Shirley & Company's “Shame, Shame, Shame” and four instrumental jams from the 1975 sessions with the guest guitarists; a new video for “Shame, Shame, Shame” will debut on Thursday (Sept. 25) directed by Dutch filmmaker Camille Boumans. The box will include a full live concert from the band's six-night residency at London's Earls Court Exhibition Centre. 


	The accompanying Blu-ray disc adds a previously unreleased TV broadcast of the Stones' 1976 show at Les Abattoirs in Paris, as well as Dolby Atmos surround sound mixes of the studio album and the live Earls Court concert. 


	Producer Andrew Watt recently told Rolling Stone magazine that he's working with the Stones again on what could be the follow-up to their Grammy-winning 24th studio album, 2023's Hackney Diamonds. Without revealing many details, Watt said, “I've said it before, but it's like working for Batman…when the tongue is up in the air, you just go… I can say we did some recording together, but that's all I can say.”

Kimmel got down to the tricky business of monologuing, and at times held back tears.

	Lars Brandle



Jimmy Kimmel is back, and he's not backing down.


	The late-night host's regular show Jimmy Kimmel Live! was sensationally pulled from the airwaves by ABC last week, following criticism of his comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk – and pressure from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr.


	A week is a lifetime in commercial television. Kimmel's suspension officially lifted with the return of his show Tuesday night, Sept. 23, and he wasted no time in resuming his merciless teasing of America's conservative media and politicians, particularly President Donald Trump.

Jimmy Kimmel Live! opened with a montage of pundits, on both ends of the political spectrum, discussing both Kimmel's return to our screens and his highly-anticipated opening monologue.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Would Kimmel double-down on his Republican jibes? Would he tease Trump? Would he call for free speech? Would he respond to the criticism of his Kirk comments? Yes, to all of it.


	But first, a timely joke. “I'm not sure who had a weirder 48 hours,” he remarked, “me or the CEO of Tylenol,” a reference to the bizarre claim made by President Trump and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that the pain-killing drug was linked to autism.


	He then got down to the tricky business of monologuing, and at times held back tears.

	











	Kimmel thanked his many friends and supporters who checked in, including his “childhood heroes” David Letterman and David Stern, and an unlikely co-sign from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who has publicly reiterated Americans' right to freedom of speech.


	“It takes courage for them to speak out against this administration,” Kimmel responded. “They did and they deserve credit for it. And thanks for telling their followers that our government cannot be allowed to control what we do and do not say on television. And that we have to stand up to it.”


	On Kirk, he remarked: “I have no illusions about changing anyone's mind, but I do want to make something clear, because it's important to me as a human and that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man. I don't think there's anything funny about it.”


	He added, “Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what it was obviously a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make.” To some, he continued, it “felt either ill-timed or unclear or maybe both.”


	This show, he continued, is not important. “What is important is that we get live in a country that allows us to have a show like this.”


	Kimmel also rounded on the ABC affiliates who took down his show. “That's not legal. That's not American. That is un-American and it's so dangerous.” The veteran broadcaster also gave a jab or eight to Trump, noting that the president's gloating remarks about Kimmel's suspension had generated enormous interest in the show. “You almost have to feel sorry for him. He tried to do his best to cancel me, instead he forced millions of people to watch the show. That backfired bigly,” he quipped. “He might have to release the Epstein files to distract us from this now.”


	In a rant on his Truth Social platform before the episode aired, Trump attacked frequent target Kimmel again, making what appeared to be a thinly-veiled threat to “test ABC out on this.” In his post, Trump wrote, “I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something happening between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‘talent' was never there.”

	











	The president then continued to make claims about what he said was overwhelmingly negative coverage of his administration. “Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who's not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE,” he wrote. “He is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers! Let Jimmy Kimmel rot in his bad Ratings.”

					By Baz Bamigboye 

Columnist/International Editor At Large


EXCLUSIVE: Denis Villeneuve will embark on the search for an actor to play the world's most famous fictional spy, James Bond, next year when he completes production on Dune: Part Three. Those familiar with the matter tell us that the director and his collaborators are seeking a “fresh face” to take on the 007 mantle in Bond 26.


	Also, Bond … James Bond will be male, as written by creator Ian Fleming, and importantly, will be an actor who hails from the British isles. 


	Yes, they want a Brit to play Bond.


	That rules out fanciful speculation that the likes of Timothée Chalamet, Glen Powell, Austin Butler, Jacob Elordi and others who don't hail from UK shores are in the running.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Frankly, 99.9% of the names we've heard speculated online so far won't make the cut.


	Those in the know tell us the ideal approach is to cast “an unknown,” possibly in his late 20s or early 30s, to play what Fleming called “a blunt instrument” — the lethal but “extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened.”


	If that criteria is stuck to, that means favourites such as Tom Hardy, aged 47, Idris Elba at 53 and Henry Cavill, aged 42, presumably don't match what Villeneuve, producers David Heyman and Amy Pascal, and execs at Amazon MGM Studios are leaning towards.


	Also, consider that by the time Bond 26 begins shooting in 2027, both Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Jack Lowden will be 37 years of age. Will they be too old for Villeneuve?


	How rugged and imposing will this Bond be? Fleming describes Bond as being over 6 foot tall, even taller in his best Jermyn Street brogues. Daniel Craig is shorter than that.


	But have a think about Steven Knight's writing credits, a key source suggests, referring to the screenwriter picked to write the script for the Amazon MGM Studios production. 


	Knight's work includes SAS Rogue Heroes, Peaky Blinders and Eastern Promises, all of them featuring kick-ass, bone-crunching scenes. “Whoever it is, has to look like he could kill you with his bare hands in a trice. From the moment you see him, that has to be readily apparent,” a person close to discussions tells us.

	











	Online speculators and betting companies throw out names without thinking who Bond is. Knight will be going back to Fleming's earliest novels — Casino Royale (1953), Live and Let Die (1954), Moonraker (1955), Diamonds Are Forever (1956), From Russia, with Love (1957), Doctor No (1958) and Goldfinger (1959) — to help remind us who Fleming's protagonist is. Might the new Bond be more in the mould of a younger Sean Connery who originated 007 in 1962's Dr. No?


	There's a sense from the many conversations I've had that Knight's going back to Bond's beginnings as a Royal Navy Commander before being recruited by MI6, the UK's foreign intelligence agency, to perhaps chart how Bond attained 007 status. I want to stress that this is what I'm hearing but to caution that none of this is confirmed or fully formed because the script is still being written and the direction of travel is still up for grabs.


	Could Bond be played by a non Caucasian, I asked sources? He could, came the reply. As always, well, nearly always, it'll come down to this: Are they right for Bond? Are they right for the story that Villeneuve and screenwriter Knight will be telling?


	While we're here, it's worth pointing out the obvious: Bond 26 will not take up where No Time to Die, the final iteration in the franchise under Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, left us; with Bond dead. “It's a new Bond, a new start, a fresh everything,” is how it was put to me by a key source who adds that it's unlikely many associated with the past Bond regime will be involved with Bond 26. That said, I suspect a few old Bond hands might well be consulted on the quiet in the snug of a private club in Pall Mall, London.


	An unprecedented number of applicants have already sent in their pitch to play James Bond to the production. “Every name you've heard of, and many you've never heard of,” a well-placed mole revealed. “We've been flooded. But understand that the casting process has not begun and it won't until Denis finishes the Dune movie,” they continued.


	It pays to remember that  Craig, who, although famous to those of us who followed his career on stage and in independent and Hollywood movies, was not a household name when he was picked to play Fleming's approved British government assassin. I know that Broccoli knew of Craig's theater history but it wasn't until she saw Matthew Vaughn's Layer Cake that she became convinced he should be cast for Casino Royale. 


	British actors in their mid 20s to early 30s, with stellar acting chops, who fit the Bond mould, are going to be under an intense spotlight for the next 12 months. Bond … James Bond is somewhere out there.


	Our sources indicate that the film will be released in 2028 with filming due to take place in 2027. There's a lot of talk about the movie premiering in the November slot favored by past Bond movies.


	By the way, just because Bond will be British, it doesn't mean that other roles, such as the Bond foe and the actress leads, can't be performed by non-Brits, as has been the case for eons.

I say he should bring back one person from the previous regime: Daniel Kleinman to do the opening titles.

Andrew Koji please

Given the lead time on this, even if they cast a young-ish guy, he'll probably age out before the picture is released.

Tom Austen… Your time has come.

The wise thing will be to go back to Flemings original vision and build from there, give us the true bond ignore the parody's and  misinterpretations.

					By Armando Tinoco 

Staff Writer


Roku is set to take us back, back to the beginning, reuniting the cast of Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the show's premiere.


The two-hour reunion special, tentatively titled “Roku Presents: The Laguna Beach Reunion,” will debut in 2026 and reunite the original cast of the series, including Lauren Conrad, Stephen Colletti and Kristin Cavallari.


	Lo Bosworth, Talan Torriero, Trey Phillips, Christina Shuller, Dieter Schmitz, Jessica Smith, and Alex Hooser will also return to reflect on the groundbreaking series that debuted on MTV in 2006.

			Watch on Deadline		







	“Laguna Beach wasn't just a television series; it defined a generation of pop culture and paved the way for the reality genre as we know it,” said Brian Tannenbaum, Head of Roku Originals, Roku Media. “Reuniting this cast two decades later is a dream, and we are delighted to give streamers a front-row seat to the nostalgia.”


Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County aimed to provide a genuine glimpse into the lives of young adults in the coastal California community, inspired by the success of Fox's scripted series The O.C. The reality series, shot like a documentary, was a success and gave way to several spinoffs, including Newport Harbor: The Real Orange County, set in neighboring coastal city Newport Beach, and The Hills, which followed Lauren Conrad as she made strides in the fashion industry.


	“When I first pitched the show to my bosses at MTV, never in a million years did I think we would find such a perfect group of real friends. The show not only changed my life and the cast's lives, but the series meant so much to a generation of fans who've been waiting for this,” said Liz Gateley, Series Creator. “To partner with Roku to reunite the cast and produce this special with Lauren, Stephen & Kristin as Executive Producers 20 years later is a dream.”

	











Roku Presents: The Laguna Beach Reunion is executive-produced by Liz Gateley on behalf of Damsel Media. Lauren Conrad, Stephen Colletti, and Kristin Cavallari also serve as executive producers. Lucilla D'Agostino and Barry Poznick executive produce on behalf of Big Fish Entertainment. Bill Langworthy serves as executive producer and showrunner. Olivia LaRoche and Louisa Lenander Friedman oversee the reunion special on behalf of Roku Originals.


	The reunion special will be available to stream for free on Roku devices or TVs as well as online at TheRokuChannel.com and on iOS and Android devices, Amazon Fire TVs, Samsung TVs, Google TVs, and other Android TV OS devices.

					By Andreas Wiseman 

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: Stephen King novella Rat is getting a movie adaptation from a team including The Witch and The Lighthouse producer Jay Van Hoy.


	The screenplay adaptation comes from Jeff Howard (The Haunting of Hill House) while directing will be Mexican filmmaker Isaac Ezban, known for movies Mal de Ojo and Párvulos. Also producing are Fernando Ferro (The Birthday Cake) and Paul Perez (Father of the Bride).


	The story follows Drew Larson, a writer “cursed by his own ambition. Each attempt at a novel has ended in disaster—illness, misfortune, or worse. Determined to break the cycle, he retreats to a desolate cabin in the Maine woods, convinced this time will be different. But as a violent storm traps him in isolation, Drew's body falters and his mind begins to unravel. In the grip of fever and madness, a stranger appears—an uncanny visitor who promises salvation and success…for a price Drew can barely comprehend.”

	King's novella comes from the 2020 collection If It Bleeds. It joins a list of stories from the same book that have been adapted into features and TV shows, including Mike Flanagan's The Life of Chuck, starring Tom Hiddleston and Mark Hamill, and Netflix's Mr. Harrigan's Phone. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	The Washington Post called the novella “an unpredictable, often hallucinatory narrative … one of King's definitive explorations of the dark side of the creative impulse.”


	Ezban, co-founder of Red Elephant Films, is an emerging voice in Latin American genre movies who has previously earned praise from Guillermo del Toro. Howard has established himself as a writer-producer in genre across film (Oculus, Gerald's Game, Ouija: Origin of Evil) and TV (Resident Evil, The Haunting of Hill House, Midnight Mass).


	Van Hoy and Ferro most recently wrapped the crime thriller 52nd State, written and directed by Todd Yellin with Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings exec-producing. Perez, most recently produced a remake of Father of the Bride with Plan B for Warner Bros, which became the most watched streaming-only movie for HBO Max. He's also versed in Stephen King IP having worked on Doctor Sleep while an executive at Warner Bros.

	











	Ezban said: “Stephen King has always been my favorite writer, ever since I started reading horror as a teenager, and since then, I've had the long-time dream of adapting some of his material… He embodies that essence of the contrast of beauty and brutality that has shaped my vision and sensibilities as a storyteller. I've read most of his work, and Rat remains one of my favorite stories he's ever created… the perfect match — a dark, intimate, bizarre, even humorous and deeply unsettling story that gets under your skin… I see this as a survival movie about writer's block, and also as the ultimate tale of our craft vs. our people, our creations vs. our loved ones, our art vs. our family, a theme I can very personally relate to. King has always inspired me as a filmmaker and a storyteller, and I feel honored to bring this tale to life.”


	In a joint statement, the producers added: “Coming off the incredible experience of producing 52nd State, we were eager to dive into a project with the same level of ambition and artistic edge. Rat gives us that opportunity. Stephen King's work has always been a touchstone for genre filmmakers, and with Isaac and Jeff steering this adaptation, we believe it will capture both the terror and humanity that make his stories timeless.”


	Recent King adaptations include Francis Lawrence's The Long Walk at Lionsgate and Flanagan's upcoming Carrie series at Prime Video.


	Isaac Ezban is repped by Vision. Jeff Howard is repped by CAA and Industry Entertainment. Fernando Ferro and Jay Van Hoy are represented by Andrew Randone and Bala Law Firm. Paul Perez is repped by Del Shaw, Moonves.

EXCLUSIVE: Here's your first look at Heated Rivalry, Crave‘s steamy TV drama series. We can also reveal the series will launch in Canada in November.


Heated Rivalry follows a pair of leading Major League Hockey players who harbor a secret: Away from their rivalry on the ice, they are secretly lovers who initially hide their confusing and complicated relationship from the world.


	Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie star as the serious-minded Canadian captain of the Montreal Meteors, and Russian star and playboy Ilya Rozanov of the Boston Raiders, respectively.

	The show comes from Jacob Tierney and Brendan Brady from Accent Aigu Entertainment, who have adapted author Rachel Reid's novels charting the love affair. “Their connection feels so real, as Rachel allowed for this complicated dynamic that grows over seven years,” Tierney told Deadline in an exclusive interview.


	Tierney and Brady are among the hottest producers in Canadian TV right now, coming off Letterkenny and Shoresy. They optioned the book before writing a pilot on spec and selling the idea to Crave.


	Bell Media streamer commissioned the series earlier this year, with Bell's General Manager of Original Programming Carlyn Klebuc saying it was “going to be buzzy,” and the Canadian giant's VP of Content Development & Programming, Justin Stockman, adding it was “a very big swing.” Sphere Abacus, the Bell-owned sales house, is shopping the series at MIPCOM Cannes next month.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


Amazon MGM Studios‘ adaptation of Rebecca Yarros' bestselling novel Fourth Wing is closing in on a new showrunner. Wednesday Season 2 executive producer Meredith Averill is in final negotiations to board the project as writer and executive producer, sources tell Deadline.


	She would succeed Moira Walley-Beckett who left in June, a year after she was tapped to pen the adaptation. WandaVision creator Jac Schaeffer was among a number of top writers who met on the project.


	The Fourth Wing TV series comes from Michael B. Jordan's Outlier Society, Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy's Kilter Films and Premediated Productions.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Planned as a five-book series, with Fourth Wing (2023), Iron Flame (2023) and Onyx Storm (2025) as the first three titles, The Empyrean follows twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail as she leaves the life of a Scribe behind at her mother's demand that she become a dragon rider. At the order of her mother, who is a General in the military of Navarre, Violet enters the brutal ranks of Basgiath War College, which trains up-and-coming riders through the Graduate or Die method.


Fourth Wing has spent 88 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, 18 of them at #1.


	Averill was co-developer, executive producer and co-showrunner on Netflix's Locke & Key, based on the comic books. She was creator/executive producer on the CW's Star-Crossed and also executive produced Netflix's The Haunting of Hill House.

International Investigations Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Rebel Wilson is back in the director's chair amid the volcanic dispute over her debut feature The Deb.


	Wilson, star of Pitch Perfect and Bridesmaids, will write, direct, produce, and star in comedy Girl Group. Production is underway in the UK with an ensemble cast including Randall Park  (WandaVision) and BAFTA-winner Sheridan Smith (Mrs Biggs).


	Produced by Live Nation Studios (A Star is Born) and Future Artists Entertainment (Poker Face), Wilson stars in Girl Group as a pop diva who's been kicked out of her own group's reunion tour and slapped with a community service court order.

	She seizes the chance to stage a comeback by coaching a group of misfit teen girls for a major record label audition, only to push them too far, forcing her to confront her toxic industry — and her own streak of self-destruction.




			Watch on Deadline		







Deadline first reported on Girl Group in 2019 when it was housed at Lionsgate, though the film has shifted focus considerably after it was originally announced as a story about a Korean American high school girl who enters a talent contest to perform alongside a K-pop band.


	Wilson's first feature, The Deb, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival last year, but remains unreleased amid a messy legal wrangle between the Australian star and the film's British producers. Up next for Wilson is Tinsel Town, a Sky Original Cinema holiday film co-starring Kiefer Sutherland, which is also being produced by Future Artists Entertainment.

	











Girl Group‘s other cast members include Jamie Lee O'Donnell (Derry Girls) and Guz Khan (The Gentlemen). Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts, Spice Girl Melanie Chisholm, and All Saints' Shaznay Lewis will form the band Girlfriends alongside Wilson's character. Loren Gray will also star.


	Producers conducted a nationwide search across the U.S. to discover the young leads who will play the teen girl group coached by Wilson. Their names are yet to be announced. Wicked choreographer Chris Scott is also on board.


	The film is produced by Wilson under her Camp Sugar banner, alongside Matt Williams of Future Artists Entertainment. Ryan Kroft and Michael Rapino executive produce for Live Nation Studios.


	Wilson described Girl Group as the “ultimate girl power movie.” She added: “Ever since being a part of the Pitch Perfect franchise, I've always wanted to create something similar. Girl Group is just so fun and full of spirit that's ready to have you singing and dancing out of the cinema.”


	Kroft said the feature hopes to capture the “timeless magic of a girl group,” while Williams added that it was a “true celebration of girl power.”


	Wilson is represented by UTA; Tavistock Wood in the UK; Creative Representation in Australia, and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern.

Finding a babysitter can be murder, and The Hand That Rocks The Cradle is back to scare young parents out of another date night.

The cradle now rocks on streaming as this remake of the classic murderous nanny movie heads to Hulu this October. Based on Curtis Hanson's 1992 original, the remake follows young mother Caitlin Morales (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) as she welcomes a new nanny, Polly Murphy (Maika Monroe), into her family. Polly came with impeccable references that, nevertheless, neglected to mention her penchant for self-mutilation and maternal manipulation. At least we can take solace in the fact that the nanny isn't an AI.

The Alien movies are defined by genre diversity. We've had slashers in space, war and prison films set in distant worlds, and even ones where the Xenomorphs attack an unsuspecting Earth. With Alien: Earth, Noah Hawley delivered the first major Alien release about synthetics with the consciousness of children that befriend the Xenomorph to take down their corporate overlords. In some ways, it's reminiscent of last year's Alien: Romulus, which similarly focused on a band of magical orphans. Earth is much more successful than Fede Álvarez's reboot. That's because Earth gets a lot right about the underpinnings of the series as a whole. Hawley's vision exists in a world where people are the property of corporations and where, even in death, humans continue their undying quest to please the companies that gave their lives some semblance of purpose. It's a world where simply knowing you have shelter is worth hunting a Xenomorph. Alien has never looked so contemporary. 

In “The Real Monsters,” Hawley and co-writer Migizi Pensoneau don't hide who they think the real monsters are—even as the Lost Boys become ghosts. But the best Alien movies aren't only about monsters. They're about heroes, namely Ripley, a capable Weyland-Yutani warrant officer whose practical rule-following would've helped numerous Xenomorph victims survive to the end of the credits. She thinks for herself and understands the value of a good quarantine, and a character like her is distinctly missing from Alien: Earth. Without that humanist center, it's all synthetics, trillionaires, and squid monsters, with not much concern for what happens to any of them. It might seem like a minor detail, but the fact that no one is really scared of the aliens becomes a significant problem in the last two episodes, especially when the Xenomorphs escape. Even then, the aliens feel somewhat like an afterthought, as if Hawley was more excited to make a show about the sentience of robots than the terror of corporations locating the universe's most dangerous killers. One could almost pluck the Xenomorph out of the show and not much would change. Still, it's hard to fault him. 

Right now, especially, as the AI bubble expands ever further and ChatGPT users fall in love or into psychosis, Hawley is asking the right questions. But is this the right medium to do it in? He's set up a season two where Wendy, the Lost Boys, the Xenomorph, and Baby Xenomorph use their WiFi-enabled telekinesis to overthrow the corporate nation states and forge a new path for humanity. Is that really what Alien: Earth is about? Personally, despite the cutting satire and serviceable alien blood-letting, nothing about “The Real Monsters” gets me all that excited for another season. That might be my trepidation and exhaustion about spending time with the Lost Boys. Adults playing kids has led the show down some interesting corridors, and the performances can be funny and emotional. However, they never reach the same compelling heights of Ripley, Newt, or even Hudson, all of whom are so expertly characterized that we barely know anything about them but still find them very compelling. There's a detachment to the Lost Boys that hinders the human connection that makes launching a Xenomorph out of the airlock so exhilarating. Not that we need to compare the show Alien or Aliens, but those are just some of the expectations that come with the franchise, and Alien: Earth can't meet them. It's merely solid.  

In its final forty-five minutes, Alien: Earth reveals itself less as a Neverland and more as an Island Of Doctor Moreau. The Xenomorph has escaped and roams free across Prodigy Island, sniffing Arthur's waterlogged corpse and terrifying Dame as she lays posies on the graves of kids she killed. Atom gives Boy Kavalier the skinny on the many problems he's not taking seriously enough: Non-essential staff have evacuated; Yutani forces are on the way and blocking communications; the Lost Boys are in a holding cell, but it's only a matter of time before they decide to break free; and a Xenomorph keeps killing what few marines remain. Oh, also, Wendy has gone totally Neo and can control Prodigy's matrix with her mind. 

In the Lost Boys' holding cell, Wendy's evolution continues. She's mobilizing the hybrids by poking holes in Kavalier's logic. “In the book, Wendy Darling is Peter Pan's favorite, and then she grew up,” Wendy tells Curly, who won't stop insisting that, as the favorite, she's not supposed to be there. “And that made Peter mad, so he kidnapped her daughter, Jane. We're all in this cell because we can't be kids anymore, but they won't let us be adults.” What does one do when they can be neither kid nor adult? They become ghosts. Using her ability to hack Prodigy's computer systems, Wendy begins tormenting her captors, primarily Dame, with videos of the kids before the operation. This finally gets Kavalier's attention. 

In his office, Kavalier continues brainstorming people to feed to The Eye. (I guess he had a brain fart with that eureka moment last week.) Kavalier confronts his hybrids to give them his spiel about his past. He was the miracle baby of an alcoholic from a long line of mouthbreathers, each meaner than the last. But the boy genius was destined to rule the world, if his dad didn't kill him first. At age six, he built his first synth, which we can assume is Atom, and that synth killed his father. Moreover, he finally spells out what has been gnawing at the hybrids all season: Kavalier believes his creations belong to him and that their rebellion is messing with his bottom line. He's a trillionaire on the verge of making immortality a consumer product. Unfortunately, without Atom or Kirsh to protect him, the Lost Boys lock Kavalier in the cell and head out onto the island for mischief purposes. 

Kavalier's history serves as a poignant reflection of Hermit and Wendy and a good reminder to the hybrid that she probably shouldn't hold Hermit shooting Nibs against her brother. After a brief tussle with The Eye, brother and sister reconcile quickly. Meanwhile, Morrow heads for Kirsh, getting the drop on the synth, but he's unable to finish the job and ends up being choked out after breaking Kirsh's back. Smee and Slightly, who have similarly put their crimes out of their minds for the task at hand, discover them and restrain Kirsh and Morrow to take them back to the cell. 

Like House Of The Dragon‘s last season, the end comes all too quickly, leaving the show on a “that's it?” moment and audiences to wonder if there's another episode coming. All the bad guys are rounded up; Wendy and Hermit bury the hatchet; and The Eye finds a new host in Arthur, who cannot catch a break. Wendy provides a little final commentary on the whole Peter Pan thing, ruling that Boy Kavalier isn't the boy who never grew up but rather the boy who was always a man and an angry little one at that. With their crew assembled, the Lost Boys and the Xenomorphs are ready to rule. A new world awaits, and who's going to stop them? They've got a Xenomorph on their side.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Alien: Earth's Wendy is more like David than Ripley after all","https://www.avclub.com/alien-earth-wendy-is-more-like-david-than-ripley","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

[Editor's note: This piece contains spoilers for Alien: Earth.]  

The first season of Noah Hawley's latest show used Ridley Scott's 1979 film Alien as its main template, right down to the analog technology and morally questionable androids. Sure, Alien: Earth incorporated some of the visual language of James Cameron's sequel and even had subtle nods to David Fincher's third film and some of the unproduced Alien projects that almost came to be in the '80s and '90s. But it largely felt like a deviation from Scott's divisive prequels, Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, something lauded by those who don't like those films. What if this was just the setup to take viewers into more deeply philosophical waters regarding evolution, creation, and morality? It felt like Sydney Chandler's Wendy was being positioned as a Ripley character when the series began. At the end of season one, the question might be: What if she's David?

The Alien franchise has long been about evolution, both in the form of the Xenomorph and in the use of hybrids/synthetics to question what it means to be human. While Alien: Earth was filled with both, it avoided a lot of the philosophical underpinnings of Scott's arguably action-light prequels. But where the season ends almost demands that their themes become the backbone of the follow-up. 

Of course, it's not like Hawley wasn't laying this foundation all season. His vision of three variations of evolved human beings seeded fertile ground for explorations of what it means to be human even while soldiers were getting chomped by aliens. He defined three kinds of evolved beings in the premiere: cyborgs, synths, and hybrids. And then he gave us models of each to follow, revealing the flaws in their systems along the way. Kirsh, a synthetic, is the calculated mentor and trainer of Wendy and the Lost Boys, but Hawley and Olyphant don't play him like a villainous betrayer à la Ash from Scott's film, saving that kind of malevolent obeisance for Morrow, the cyborg security officer willing to do literally anything to complete his mission. Is it the human or the machine in Morrow that makes him a sociopath? That's up to the viewer to determine.

And then there's Wendy, the first hybrid. If Morrow is a human with machine parts on the outside, Wendy is a machine with human parts on the inside. The first season had lots of fun alien action, but it was really about Wendy's ascension to becoming the most powerful being in the show's universe. Not only can she control technology in a way that basically allows her to shut down the villainous Atom Eins like she's a Jedi, but she can speak to the xenomorphs, and they seem to follow her instructions. At the end of the first season, she's completely turned the tables on her very own Peter Pan, locking Boy Kavalier, Kirsh, Morrow, Dame Sylvia, and Atom Eins in the pen that once housed her and the other Lost Boys, with xenomorphs on the edge of it like dogs waiting to unleash hell at their commander's order. Her last line is “Now we rule.”

So how will Wendy rule? The question that will define the future is whether she chooses humanity or transcends it, giving in to her godlike control. Will she align with the little girl inside her or abuse the power she's discovered she holds? 

Which brings us back to David. Played by Michael Fassbender in Prometheus, David was a stand-in for a being who has become more powerful than its creator. Much of sci-fi history has been conceived around the idea of what happens when men become gods, reversing the hierarchy in a way that usually leads to disaster. Creation is generally considered a godlike act, so the arc of David overtaking his creators has parallels to man thinking himself a god. By the end of his two-movie arc (which, now, sadly looks unlikely to be completed), David has full control of his ship and its cargo, including humans and alien embryos, playing interstellar god. He is, in many ways, where Wendy is at the end of Alien: Earth: getting ready to rule. And don't forget that he too was created as a step on an evolutionary ladder, much like Wendy exists as a quest for immortality that has overtaken its creator.

Of course, Wendy has more human connections to provide moral quandaries, including her loyalty to her brother and the other Lost Boys. But we saw her question Joe's actions in the season's penultimate episode and, crucially, see her exerting hierarchy over the other Lost Boys in the final chapter. She's not one of them anymore. She's Wendy Darling, the favorite. 

At the end of J.M. Barrie's book, Wendy returns to Peter a year after their adventures in Neverland, but he doesn't remember her. It's a common theme in children's literature in that Wendy has to grow up and put Tinker Bell, the Lost Boys, and Hook in her memory. It feels like Hawley's Wendy has done the same at the end of “The Real Monsters,” although it's interesting that he and episode co-writer Migizi Pensoneau nod to the epilogue that Barrie wrote. In When Wendy Grew Up, An Afterthought, Peter comes back to Wendy, but she's got a daughter named Jane, and Wendy is the one who doesn't remember. In Alien: Earth, the Lost Boy known as Curly becomes Jane, furthering the idea that Wendy is now superior: She's a “mother,” another word that has weighted meaning in the Alien universe.

And none of the above speculation even touches on The Eye taking over Arthur like a crab entering a new shell and what that says about evolution (and the badass potential of that subplot). One of the great joys of this first season has been how unpredictably Hawley has woven the themes of previous Alien lore into something that feels both connected and new. What if Wendy isn't Ripley or David? She could be something altogether different, a blending of things fans know and love about both characters. An evolution. A real hybrid.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Marvel Zombies has plenty of gore but no guts","https://www.avclub.com/marvel-zombies-review-tv-disney-plus","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Shambling onto Disney+ just in time for Halloween, Marvel Zombies reimagines the popular five-issue horror series of the same name within the increasingly cumbersome Cinematic Universe. Iconic heroes and villains have become flesh-hungry super-ghouls, leaving Marvel's post-Endgame second-stringers, each with their own tentative franchises, to save the world. The result is an ambitious, if busy and ceaselessly quippy, miniseries that demands some labor from its viewers. Without keeping meticulous pace with MCU Phases Four to Six, several open Wikipedia tabs might be needed to understand who's who and why they matter. That's Marvel Zombies: a TV-MA spectacle rife with squishy sound effects and digital viscera, with stakes intelligible only to the canon obsessed.

To enjoy it, one must also accept the conceit that a zombie outbreak could indiscriminately affect the MCU's most powerful players. No healing factor, no alien origin, no super-soldier serum can protect against it—aside from one convenient and spoilery exception. Worse for the survivors, the infected keep their powers and a degree of intelligence. For instance, Zombie Hawkeye can still put an arrow through a target's eye socket if he so wishes. One sequence shows how Thanos might have wielded the Infinity Gauntlet as a flesh-craving beast, and the difference to the more lucid Josh Brolin version isn't as striking as you'd expect (quieter maybe). Marvel Zombies is at its strongest when the undead weaponize their powers to gruesome, zombie-splatting effect.

Created by Bryan Andrews (What If…?) and Zeb Wells (fresh from a divisive run on the Spider-Man comics), the series is a vividly hued, antiseptically polished facsimile of the MCU that leans excessively on its snarky post-Whedon cadence. At this Phase in Marvel's run (Six for those keeping score), many of its foundational stars have since moved on or have reskinned as new characters, making its fresh-faced legacy cast feel like a test assembly for Avengers: Doomsday. There's Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), a.k.a. Ms. Marvel, the heart of the series and its ersatz Frodo Baggins. And her fellowship is comprised of Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Red Guardian (David Harbour), Shang-Chi (Simu Liu), Katy (Awkwafina), and, later, Spider-Man (Hudson Thames), with the villainous Baron Zemo (Daniel Brühl) skulking around the periphery. 

Their epic quest begins with Kamala and her crew of Young Avengers (Hailee Steinfeld's Hawkeye and Dominique Thorne's Ironheart) living in a bombed-out Manhattan, where they stumble across the series' MacGuffin: a “subspace transmitter” shrunk by Pym particles. This discovery compels them to crack the secrets of “Project: Lifeshot,” a mysterious last-ditch effort to reverse the zombie plague. After some perfunctory bickering about their chances of finding the nearest S.H.I.E.L.D. outpost—Ironheart locates one in Ohio, which is quite a jaunt—they agree with a fist-bump to head out and save the world. 

Naturally, obstacles arise. Most of the planet's shamblers are remote-controlled by a zombified Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), who also wants the subspace doo-dad for hidden reasons. Despite their sinister, crimson eyes and tremendous numbers, her army pops up wherever the story needs them to. And before the first episode ends, Kamala has been separated from her pals by a surprise horde, leaving her in the enigmatic company of Blade (Todd Williams), the day-walking vampire avatar of Konshu and this universe's Moon Knight, who aids Ms. Marvel on her way to S.H.I.E.L.D., where they hope the MacGuffin will do some good.



Like nearly every MCU entry that precedes it, Marvel Zombies is a quips-first genre exercise, and it's difficult to invest in any of it emotionally. Its stakes shift from moment to moment, like when Kamala and Blade meet a faction of Black Widows who control a battalion of zombies of their own through the power of science. Which zombies should our heroes fear? All of them? None of them? Everyone takes the walking dead, not to mention the fall of society, in stride. Nameless human shields protect the more established characters from death and/or dismemberment, which saps danger from the premise until each successively frantic action scene feels more obligatory than exciting.

The drama buckles under boilerplate platitudes, delivered by uncanny CG faces with creepy teeth and eyebrows that constantly wriggle like restless caterpillars. (After one noble sacrifice, someone cools their comic routine long enough to declare, “We will honor [them] by taking this planet back from the dead!”) Whenever there's a dilemma or an enemy to defeat, Blade, clearly meant to farm aura well ahead of whenever his live-action MCU debut is supposed to take place, mentally calculates a solution or slices the latest sub-boss to bloody bits. The braintrust behind Marvel Zombies has clearly seen a monster movie or two, and they feel confident exploiting its tropes. But harnessing the genre's morbid sense of doom requires an anarchic approach that risk-averse Marvel Studios does not permit.

The biggest problem with Marvel Zombies is tonal whiplash. One minute, the show dabbles in Endgame grandiosity; the next, it veers into Love And Thunder frippery. One wonders who it's made for. Helicopter parents probably won't let their kids watch the cartoon bloodshed, and longtime Marvel followers might grow weary of its heroes' smug overconfidence. Casual viewers may find it faintly diverting, while horror hounds might consider its zombie carnage too sterile. Four half-hour episodes with a cast this size isn't enough time to explore the dramatic headspace of these characters, so dialogue is reduced to blunt emotions or villainous intent. And since these folks have yet to assemble in the live-action MCU, Zombies is in the unenviable position of experimenting with their chemistry, and the resulting alchemy proves alarmingly inert. Even with the zombie apocalypse there to spice up their lives, Marvel's newest heroes are less lively than the arm-munchers surrounding them. 

Marvel Zombies premieres September 24 on Disney+

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Jimmy Kimmel returns to ABC for a hero's welcome and a heartfelt monologue","https://www.avclub.com/jimmy-kimmel-return-monologue-abc-disney","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 05:39:00 GMT","

Jimmy Kimmel returned to ABC's late-night line-up tonight—well, in some markets. Though FCC Chair Brendan Carr's comments last week have inspired Sinclair and Nexstar broadcast groups to continue preempting Kimmel's show, the host delivered a heartfelt and, dare we say, historic monologue to the rest of America. Those serviced by Sinclair and Nexstar will have to search it out on YouTube.

Kimmel received a hero's welcome at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood as he rattled off the names of people who offered words of support to the comedian. Late-night hosts from around the world reached out to Kimmel, who got a job offer from a German late-night show. “This country has become so authoritarian,” Kimmel said, “That Germans are like, ‘Come here. Come here.'”



But while many reached out to Kimmel with kind words, the host had even kinder ones for those who were not fans. “I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” he said. A choked-up Kimmel delivered conciliatory comments to those who took offense to the comments that got him pulled from the air.

“I have no illusions about changing anyone's mind, but I do want to make something clear because it's important to me as a human,” he said. “It was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man. I don't think there's anything funny about it. I posted a message on Instagram the day he was killed, asking for compassion, and I meant it.”

“It was never my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what was obviously a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make, but I understand that to some, it felt either insensitive or unclear, or maybe both. For those who think I pointed a finger, I get why you're upset.”

Kimmel also took a moment to thank Disney for creating space for a show that could potentially catch the ire of the federal government for the last 23 years, while also making light of the consumer revolt in the wake of Kimmel's suspension. Not to mention, he thanked his viewers for the revolt and demanded that those same people show up for Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers should the president target them.

He was less gracious toward FCC Chair Brendan Carr, whom he characterized as “the most embarrassing car Republicans have embraced” since the Cybertruck. He pointed out Carr and Trump's blatant hypocrisy and the betrayal of their so-called free speech ideals. “The President of the United States made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs,” Kimmel said. “Our leader celebrates Americans losing their jobs because he can't take a joke.”

That's not to say the monologue was all Kimmel choking back tears and setting records straight—though there was plenty of that. He also continued his tradition of saying things that would irritate the president. Namely, after a week of claiming that Kimmel has “no ratings.” Kimmel's response: “Well, I do tonight.”

“You almost have to feel sorry for him,” said Kimmel. “He tried his best to cancel me. Instead, he forced millions of people to watch the show. That backfired bigly. He might have to release the Epstein files to distract us from this.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","John Boyega says he would've made a very different Star Wars sequel trilogy","https://www.avclub.com/john-boyega-star-wars-sequel-trilogy","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 03:58:00 GMT","

While much of the Star Wars discourse has moved on from the sequel trilogy, actor John Boyega continues to make it clear that Disney's shortcomings were not his fault. Few could blame the actor for having a complicated relationship with the movies. From the very second he appeared on screen, he was subject to racist vitriol that continued throughout the release cycle. That his character, Finn, never developed a coherent arc didn't help. After the series petered out with Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker, which revealed Finn to be a space equestrian, Boyega made his issues with Disney, particularly its handling of non-white characters, very well known. Appearing at Florida Supercon 2025, per Popverse, Boyega, once again, got candid about how the sequel trilogy and how he would've made a “whole completely different thing” had he been a producer.

Boyega says that if he were wearing his producer hat on Star Wars, he wouldn't be “getting rid of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, all these people.” Instead, the “first thing we're going to do is fulfill their story, their legacy.” He envisions “a good moment of handing on the baton.” He also criticizes the new characters, saying that some of them were overpowered, echoing some of the criticisms surrounding Rey in The Force Awakens. “They won't just grab stuff and know what to do with it,” he said. “You've got to struggle like every other character in this franchise. I'd do that.”

He also would change the ending of The Last Jedi. “But Luke Skywalker wouldn't be disappearing on a rock,” he continued. “Hell no. Standing there, and he's, like, a projector? I would want to give those characters way more way more.” It's not too surprising that most of his complaints, like those of many fans, are about The Last Jedi. In a 2023 appearance on the Hot Ones spin-off, Truth Or Dab: Rapid Fire, he declared The Last Jedi the worst of his three entries. “But they're all lovely,” he clarified while shooting a side-eyed glance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","WATCH: What Jimmy Kimmel Said at His First Day Back on the Air","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/watch-jimmy-kimmel-returns-abc/","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 03:57:08 GMT","

After almost one week on a forced hiatus, Jimmy Kimmel returned to ABC to host “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on Tuesday, September 23. Many celebs came to Kimmel's defense after the news broke, and fans showed their support online. Luckily, the support worked, and Kimmel has returned to the airwaves.

The night started out with a chant from the audience, clearly very excited for Kimmel's return. Then, he launched immediately into a joke about “preempting” the “regularly scheduled” airing of Family Feud, using Nexstar and Sinclair's own language against them.

Kimmel shouted out his fellow late-night hosts for standing by him: Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, Jimmy Fallon, John Oliver, and more. He also, importantly, thanked the fans for using their voices, as Kimmel said, “so I can use mine.”

He also acknowledged people like Ted Cruz, who may not agree with the things Kimmel says on his show but stood by his first amendment right to say it. Kimmel admitted he previously took his right to speak freely on his show for granted, but things changed when Stephen Colbert's show got canceled.

Regarding the statement that got Kimmel preempted in the first place, he teared up when he said, “It was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man.” He understood his words were misconstrued, but his intention was not to hurt anyone, although he recognized some people may have found his joke to be “ill-timed.”

Later in the monologue, Kimmel got a standing ovation after playing a clip of President Donald Trump claiming Kimmel had no viewership. Kimmel's response?  “I do tonight.”

Kimmel told his audience that in order to get his show back, he needed to read a statement. He then pulled out a piece of paper and read, “To reactivate your Disney+ or Hulu account, open the Disney app on your smart TV.” This was a reference to a fan boycott of Disney, the parent company of ABC, in response to Kimmel's forced hiatus.

Finally, Kimmel praised Charlie Kirk's wife for forgiving her husband's killer, again tearing up. “That is an example we should follow.”

Throughout his monologue, Kimmel urged the audience to fight for their first amendment rights, specifically the freedom of speech and of the press.

ABC announced on Wednesday evening that it was pulling Jimmy Kimmel's late night show “indefinitely” after criticism of comments he made on Monday about the motives of the man who is accused of fatally shooting the conservative activist Charlie Kirk last week. #jimmykimmel #maga #breakingnews #learnontiktok #charliekirk 

On September 15, Kimmel told a joke about the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's recent passing. In his monologue, he mentioned the “MAGA gang,” a reference to fans of President Donald Trump. Specifically, he said the following:

“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”

Two ABC affiliates, Sinclair and Nexstar, decided to pause airing “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” indefinitely due to the statement. Andrew Alford, President of Nexstar's broadcasting division, said: “Mr. Kimmel's comments about the death of Mr. Kirk are offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located.”

ABC followed suit, deciding not to air “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” at all. However, on Monday, ABC announced Kimmel would return to the airwaves. Unfortunately for some viewers, Sinclair and Nexstar will continue to preempt “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” That means depending on where you live in the United States, you may or may not be able to watch Kimmel for the time being.

The McCreerys captioned the post, “Oliver Cooke McCreery joined our family on September 18th” and included a happy tears emoji and a blue heart. “Can't imagine life without him, we love him so berry much!!”

McCreery is pictured all smiles next to Gabi as baby Oliver sleeps on her chest. In another photo the couple's 2-year-old son Avery is shown cuddled up with the sweet little bundle looking like such a proud big brother.

Back in May, the “Bottle Rockets” singer announced that he and his family would be welcoming a new member with a super cute Instagram post.  “A new best friend coming this fall!” the caption read, along with two blue heart emojis. 

McCreery and his wife were featured posing casually, dressed in matching jeans and white tees, while Avery was rocking a blue sweatshirt that read “Big Brother.” 

On August 25, the family was off on a little road trip, depicted in another Instagram post. This time, Gabi's baby bump was visible as the family posed in front of a bus. “Last bus weekend as a family of 3!” McCreery wrote in the caption.

We think Avery is going to be an awesome big brother to baby Oliver, but he also got to share some fun alone time with his dad over the summer. In July, McCreery celebrated the release of his latest EP “Scooter & Friends” with a video featuring him and his toddler son jumping off a dock together in matching red life jackets and blue swim trunks. 

McCreery's hit song of the summer “Bottle Rockets” served as the soundtrack, with the opening lyrics, “Everybody's got a summer that they can't forget.” 

In yet another Instagram post, the McCreery family is pictured enjoying their 4th of July weekend in a series of photos that captured them hanging out at the beach, lounging on a boat, and playing in the water. 

It was likely a summer that they won't forget, but now that baby Oliver is here the family will be making tons of new memories as a family of four.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘American Idol' Star Reveals He's Been Engaged 3 Times","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/david-archuleta-engaged-3-times-why/","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 13:57:11 GMT","

David Archuleta, who skyrocketed to fame on “American Idol” in 2008, spent decades grappling with his sexuality as a devout member of the Morman church. Before coming out as queer in 2021, he tried for years to convince himself he was straight because same-sex relationships were forbidden in the church. Achuleta, now 34, even got engaged to three different young women. 

Archuleta revealed that headline-making tidbit during an appearance on “The Zach Sang Show” on September 19, 2025. The singer said that before leaving the Mormon church in 2022, his multiple engagements didn't seem strange to him, but now realizes they may seem “weird from an outside perspective.” 



Archuleta, who just released his first album in five years — “Earthly Delights” — told Sang that when he released his 2020 album “Therapy Sessions,” he was still “very religious” but closeted. 

“I was going through literal therapy at the time and I thought, ‘Oh, there's something clearly wrong with me that I just need to fix,'” Archuleta recalled. “I just kind of thought anything that's wrong with you is fixable. And I just thought, you know, God has a solution to all things.” 

Getting engaged three times was part of Archuleta's attempts to live a straight life, he explained to Sang, noting, “Mormons get engaged really fast because you're supposed to get married and you're not supposed to do anything (sexually) before marriage. So, naturally, like those impulses and those urges lead to ‘Let's get married fast because we're feeling a lot um of urges, you know, and just wanting to be intimate with each other.” 

Archuleta said he shares details about his engagements in his forthcoming book, “Devout,” to be released in February 2026 with a forward by Paula Abdul. But he did tell Sang that the reason he kept proposing was because when he shared with elders in the church that he was “struggling with samesex attraction,” he was told he wasn't gay and could still marry a woman. 

“Because it's like, ‘Well, you're not gay. You just struggle with samesex attraction. There's a difference because gay people live out their life, which they shouldn't, but people who struggle with samesex attraction acknowledge that they have the urges, but they don't act on them, and that's okay with God.' So, I was like, ‘Oh, okay.'”

Archuleta continued, “And they're like, ‘Well, if you get married, God will bless you.' So I thought by doing that, like, ‘Okay I will naturally fall more and more in love with my girlfriend and … I'll have enough faith where this won't be an issue. And I just realized, you know, I feel like these girls deserve better than this. Like someone who's unsure of themselves, who hasn't fully come to be honest with himself. Trying to convince someone that, like, you're the person for them for the rest of their life. I'm really grateful that I didn't see (it) through with (them).” 

When Archuleta decided to leave the Mormon church in 2022, he worried about his mom's reaction, telling NBC, he expected her to be mad “for offending her religion by leaving it.” But instead, she decided to follow him. 

“She said, ‘If you're going to hell, then we're all going to hell with you,'” Archuleta told the outlet. That act of love from her inspired him to write and record his single “Hell Together.” 

Archuleta told Sang that before fulling embracing and becoming part of the LGBTQ+ community, he'd grown “obsessed” with his religion, attending three to five times a week as he tried to reconcile his indoctrined beliefs and his sexual identity. 

“I think it's a little confusing because you're taught like God is an all-loving and all-knowing, like never ceasing love and mercy that God shows to you,” he explained. “But at the same time, if you mess up and if you don't meet the quota, you will be cut out from his presence.” 

“He'll still, like, give you something decent,” Archuleta said he was taught, “but like, you won't have the cream on top like experience of getting to be in his presence and shine in his love and glory the way other more behaved followers will get. So you're just like, ‘Am I am I doing enough yet? Am I doing enough yet?' And it gets to the point where you're doing more than everyone else.”

In a September 2025 interview with the New York Times, filmmaker Cameron Crowe let the magazine in on an interesting statement he once witnessed an iconic director make about what he thinks will be the long-term impact of Tom Cruise's career.

Crowe revealed he was at a dinner party when he heard Clint Eastwood, revered for directing hit Western films such as “The Outlaw Josey Wales” and “Unforgiven,” name the “Top Gun” star as the actor most likely to be viewed as “a legend” a hundred years from now. Read on for details.

Relaying the story to the New York Times, Crowe said, “I have the same lawyer as Clint Eastwood, and he invited me to a dinner party. He sat me next to Clint Eastwood, and I was so nervous.” The “Almost Famous” writer recounted how Eastwood leaned over and brought up the topic of Tom Cruise.

Crowe says he told Eastwood, “Oh man, Tom Cruise. I love working with Tom Cruise.” The action star famously portrayed a dashing playboy who must grapple with the aftermath of disfiguring his face in a crash in Crowe's 2001 sci-fi thriller “Vanilla Skye,” in which he shared the screen with Penelope Cruz.

Crowe says Eastwood predicted, “In a hundred years, they're gonna look back. That's the career. Tom Cruise's career.” 

According to the Guardian, Clint Eastwood was in talks to direct a remake of “A Star Is Born” around 2012, before Bradley Cooper ultimately took over the project and released his version in 2018.

The outlet reported at the time that Eastwood was hoping to cast Tom Cruise as the lead, and was eyeing none other than Beyoncé to star across from him. The story says the “Halo” singer initially backed away from the project due to delays, but agreed to sign on once she learned Eastwood would be attached.

Producer Bill Gerber revealed Eastwood and Beyoncé even traveled for a face-to-face meeting to discuss the project. But he says the plans fell apart due to “the movie business.” He explained, “Time happened. Beyonce got pregnant, and then Clint went off and did another movie. At the time I thought, ‘I'm going to be able to make a movie with my old dear friend,' not old, my young dear friend, and I was so excited about it.”

After the missed opportunity with “A Star Is Born,” Eastwood has still never directed Cruise in a film.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Former ‘Vanderpump Rules' Star Teases Move to Bravo Spinoff","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/former-vanderpump-rules-star-teases-move-to-bravo-spinoff/","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 16:16:38 GMT","

Lala Kent is making major changes in her life.  In a September 2025 interview, the former “Vanderpump Rules” star strongly hinted that she would be joining the spinoff series “The Valley” for its third season.

According to IMDb, Kent, 35, appeared in a total of five episodes during the first two seasons of “The Valley”, which stars fellow former VPR stars Brittany Cartwright and Kristen Doute, but she was shown in a “guest capacity.”

While speaking with Us Weekly weeks after the second season aired on Bravo, Kent was asked about the possibility of future cameos on the show—and she didn't say no.

“I live in the Valley,” the mom of two replied. “And that's all I'm gonna say.”

Adding fuel to her teaser, Kent was photographed with Cartwright, Doute, and fellow “The Valley” stars Nia Sanchez, Michelle Saniei, Jasmine Goode, and Zack Wickham at an event. She captioned teh photos with, “What's going on? Where am I?”

 One fan commented, “If this is the new cast of the valley season 3 I am excited 👏👏👏👏🙌🙌🙌 Lala Kent back on my tv screen ❤️.”

A post shared by Lala Kent (@lalakent)

Kent has not been a reality TV regular since “Vanderpump Rules” wrapped its Season 11 reunion in early 2024.

On the December 31 episode of the “Not Skinny But Not Fat” podcast, Kent admitted she was “not ready to be done with reality TV.” “For me, it's just like reality TV is like my heartbeat,” she explained. “Like I get off on it. I'm obsessed. I enjoy being a part of it. I enjoy watching it. It's like such a huge part of my life, reality television.”

While she thrives on reality TV, Kent clarified that she didn't specifically move to the San Fernando Valley to be cast in the reality show with her Valley-area friends,

“People think I moved to the Valley to be on ‘The Valley,‘” she told Forbes in an interview. “You have to have such a large budget to be anywhere else in Los Angeles County and still be able to commute over the hill into the city! I'm pretty obsessed with it over here. Now, every time I cross over, I tell myself, ‘You're going to get back.' It's relaxing.”

While she's still playing coy on her future on “The Valley,” Kent recently announced a change to her “Give Them Lala” brand. Kent has been using the “Give Them Lala” label for years. She still has a makeup line with the moniker, and the title of her 2021 memoir was also titled “Give Them Lala.”

But in September 2025, Kent changed the name of her podcast to “Untraditionally Lala.” In the debut episode on Sept. 17, she explained the reason for the rebrand.

“I've had the ‘Give Them Lala' podcast for, I want to say, around six years, and it was a wonderful experience,” she told her listeners. “I loved everything we spoke about, I loved all the co-hosts that I had, all the guests. But ‘Give Them Lala' was just something that came to me, for those of you who watched ‘Vanderpump Rules' Season 5, where I just wanted to shove myself down everybody's throat whether you liked it or not.”

Kent explained that as she grew up and became a mother, the “Give Them Lala” title “just didn't sit right anymore.”

“I felt like we had outgrown it,” she explained. “I felt like it was juvenile. It was a time in my life that was wonderful, but I'll never be going back to.”

 “My life is very untraditional … so ‘Untraditionally Lala' is my new podcast, and I am so freaking excited to this new chapter,” the “Vanderpump Rules” veteran added.

In terms of meeting the moment, Jimmy Kimmel's monologue was pretty close to perfect.

Greeted by a loud, raucous audience in his Los Angeles studio but speaking to a wary, even hostile, segment of viewers at home, the late-night host returned to ABC on Tuesday night with a difficult needle to thread. He'd faced a frustrating six-day stretch off the air, after threats from FCC chairman Brendan Carr pressured Disney (ABC's parent company) to “indefinitely” suspend “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” leaving Kimmel and his hundreds of staff members in indefensible yet very real limbo.

 










Public outrage was swift and loud — almost as if Americans don't like the notion of losing their very first constitutional amendment — with formal condemnations from major news and entertainment organizations, protesters marching outside Disney's Burbank studios, and the general public boycotting the company by canceling Disney+. (How many cancellations there were remains unknown, but the movement gained enough notice for Kimmel to tee up a joke about resubscribing in his monologue.)

Still, debate was split over whether “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” would survive. TV stations owned by Nexstar and Sinclair are still refusing to air the late-night show after Kimmel's “ill-timed and insensitive” comments about Charlie Kirk's killing, and the TV station owners still hold significant sway over what Americans can or cannot watch. (Formal statements aside, it's plausible enough to believe Nexstar's boycott is related to a $6 billion acquisition in need of approval from the Trump administration.)

Even with the suspension lifted, Kimmel remained off air in many American cities — a restriction ABC countered by making the first 28 minutes of Tuesday night's show (including his post-monologue bit with Robert DeNiro) available on YouTube. 

That's a lot for Kimmel to live up to, but live up to it he did. Filled with gratitude and outrage, an emotional Kimmel started by expressing appreciation to everyone who reached out in support over the last week, citing his friends on late-night TV (including Stephen Colbert, who came up a number of times) and, later, people he typically considers his foes.

“Maybe most of all, I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” Kimmel said, before naming Ben Shapiro, Candace Owens, Mitch McConnell, and Ted Cruz as unexpected allies in the fight to protect free speech. 

 










“Even though I don't agree with many of those people on most subjects — some of the things they say even make me want to throw up,” Kimmel said, “it takes courage for them to speak out against this administration, and they did, and they deserve credit for it.”

Building bridges proved a theme of his 18-minute monologue, as Kimmel segued into what was likely the trickiest part of his speech: addressing his “controversial” comments on Charlie Kirk. 

“It was never my intention to make light of a murder of a young man,” Kimmel said, his voice cracking for the first time. “I don't think there's anything funny about it.”

He then said he never intended to blame any specific group for the actions of “a deeply disturbed individual.” 

“I don't think the murderer who shot Charlie Kirk represents anyone,” he said. “This was a sick person who believed violence was a solution, and it isn't. Ever”

While Kimmel deftly balanced clarification and contrition in discussing what he'd say before — it was important the speech never turned into an overt apology, since it was clear to any unbiased viewer he had nothing to apologize for — he didn't mince words once he turned his attention to Carr and Trump's attempts at silencing him.

 










Kimmel said he was “embarrassed” to admit he took his freedom of speech for granted “until they pulled my friend Stephen off the air and tried to coerce the affiliates who run our show in the cities you live in to take my show off the air. That's not legal, and it's not American. That's un-American.”

Then the zingers started. 

“Brendan Carr is the most embarrassing car Republicans have embraced since this one,” Kimmel said, before showing a Cybertruck emblazoned with “Trump.”

“[Trump] did his best to cancel me and instead he forced millions of people to watch the show. That backfired bigly. He might have to release the Epstein files to distract us from this now.”

And in response to Trump repeatedly claiming Kimmel has “no ratings,” the comedian keenly crowed, “Well, I do tonight.”

Still, Kimmel never came off as a braggart. He didn't sound like a whiner, either, nor did he play up his position as a martyr. Instead, his monologue brimmed with humanity. You can see it in his tear-filled eyes when he talks about forgiveness, just as you can hear it in his resilient voice when he calls for a continued, “louder” defense of our civil liberties. There's no mistaking this man for the cruel, insensitive comic his critics have tried to paint him as, and his carefully considered speech dismantled those attacks without backing down from his own beliefs. 

 










“A government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn't like is anti-American,” Kimmel said. “That's anti-American. I am so glad we have some solidarity on that.”

Claiming solidarity on what is or isn't American may be a reach, but reaching for solidarity — especially in this moment — is exactly the right move. If anything to be taken away from Kimmel's temporary banishment right now, today, before the news cycle jumps to its next crisis, it's that people didn't like it. Popular opinion was on his side, and Kimmel's monologue drove that point home time and time again. He cited principled positions most reasonable people support, and he did so while emphasizing his personal, wide-reaching compassion. 

Viewers needed to see him to believe free speech is still an inviolable right in this country, and his monologue is virtually unassailable in no small part because he stood up there and said it.

Trump fans won't care, but they never would, and Kimmel knows that. Trump also won't care, and Kimmel knows that, too. Contradicting self-evident truths has never been an issue for our president of alternate facts, and whether he wants to continue his crusade against Kimmel, late-night television, and free speech in general is an unanswerable question. Kimmel acknowledged as much when he closed the show with, “I think we'll see you tomorrow.” 

 










On Tuesday night, Kimmel did everything he could to ensure that comes true. Now, we just have to keep up the volume. 

“Jimmy Kimmel Live!” airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. ET on ABC. Episodes are available the next day on Hulu.

River Cartwright is a mess. Or that's what people keep telling him, anyway.

Following last season's reunion-spoiling revelations about his father (ex-CIA operative Frank Harkness) and his father's past (raising children to be super-soldiers), the galloping young stallion (played by Jack Lowden) hasn't been able to screw his head on straight. Lamb (Gary Oldman) unfavorably compares him to a “crack-up, a drunk, [and] a psychopath.” Standish (Saskia Reeves) reprimands River for not dealing with his issues as well as he could (a.k.a. her version of Lamb's blistering reproach). And Louisa (Rosalind Eleazar) lays it out as plainly as can be: “You're a mess,” she says. “You're not allowing yourself to feel things that you should be feeling.”

 








Related Stories Jimmy Kimmel Made Himself Unassailable — Will That Be Enough? One Volcano After Another: Designing a Legendary Battle Sequence for the ‘Chief of War' Finale 

But River doesn't see it, and frankly, neither do we. Sure, he snaps at Shirley (Aimee-Ffion Edwards) for no good reason, and yeah, his instincts aren't as attuned as one would hope. (He makes an obviously errant pass at the worst possible moment.) But River has always been rough around the edges. His blunt bullheadedness is part of what landed him in Slough House, MI5's storage locker for damaged agents, but it's also what's helped the haphazard team save the day, time and again, season after season.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






So what's the truth? Is River in desperate need of some R&R, or is everyone else projecting their own predicaments onto him? Well, after five seasons of Will Smith's savvy Apple series, there's little question as to who's right in this regard: It's Lamb. Our foul, flatulent father-figure may exaggerate a bit when belittling his enemies (and friends, for that matter), but cloaked under his aura of filth — like an adult Pig-Pen's toxic dust cloud — rests a core truth. So as soon as Lamb backs a team he's wont to disagree with, any mystery around River's mental health status is settled: He's a mess.

Even with one false impression exposed, splits in perception become a running theme of Season 5. When Roddy (Christopher Chung) almost gets hit by a van, Shirley claims she saved him from an intentional attack. But Roddy argues she was just “looking for an excuse to sexually harass me” and demands reimbursement for his damaged clothes. Is someone trying to kill him, or is Shirley's personal loss (Marcus, last season) making her paranoid? Later, Roddy needs to look his best for a date with a woman way out of his league, yet his inflexible ego — and a cozy night at the club — make their shared passions seem weirdly plausible. Did Roddy, of all people, find love, or is she… being paid for her services (as his peers repeatedly contend)? 

 










Distinguishing the appearance of truth from truth itself isn't limited to individuals, either. Season 5 is set in a country gone “fucking mad.” When a campaign volunteer for the mayor gets killed by a gunman who supports the opposition, investigators prepare for the ramifications of a political attack. But when it turns out the shooter — who police initially believed had taken his own life — was, in fact, shot by someone else, the assumed situation spawns question after question: Who? When? Why?

As more strange situations sweep London, our favorite scruffy spies must decide what, who, and how much to believe. Is this a particularly bad week, filled with normal crises at an abnormal pace, or is there some sort of grand conspiracy connecting each bizarre emergency? Who among them should they listen to (besides Lamb), and whose vision is being clouded by personal bias? But also, how much is too much? If one far-fetched theory is proven credible, what other previously disregarded ideas merit reconsideration?

Invigorating in its temerity, Smith's six-episode Season 5 is told with propulsive clarity (save for the mysteries you're intended to guess at). Chaos is sorted into appreciable story arcs without diluting its overwhelming effect on our heroes. The element of chance isn't treated as a convenient plot device, nor is it pushed aside entirely so a grand plan can click into place. Best of all, Slough House's ability to make sense of the senseless becomes their key to saving the day. We may not always be able to separate reality from perception — sometimes differing perceptions simply can't coexist — but we can still respect and value actual intelligence, especially when it's used to solve public problems. 

 










Problems “Slow Horses” directly links to anti-intellectualists, ignorant bullies, and willful distorters of the historical record — natural enemies of any self-respecting spy. They don't call them intelligence agents for nothing, and Season 5 is a nice reminder of their basic function: not only to know more than your Average Joe, but to apply that knowledge toward keeping the peace. 

River, very much looking the part of an internet boyfriend on the rise, is a mess, and Lamb, the living embodiment of “don't judge a book by his cover,” makes for the perfect person to call him out. If we can all agree the clean-cut, handsome kid is more mixed-up than the slovenly old man about to clear the room with his farts, then maybe there's hope yet for a shared reality rooted in truth. Fingers crossed.

“Slow Horses” Season 5 premieres Wednesday, September 24 on Apple TV+. New episodes will be released weekly through the finale on October 29. The series has been renewed through Season 7.

One of Ethan Hawke's greatest attributes as an actor is that he makes things look easy. That's not to say that the star doesn't put the work in — you don't get Emmy and Tony nominations, write several books, and direct your own films when you're just coasting.

But since his emergence as a movie star in the '90s, the Austin-born actor has always had a laidback, easygoing vibe that's made his movie star swagger seem effortless and allowed him to sink convincingly into most every part he's ever taken. That attitude made him something of a Gen X icon in his day, when he starred in films like “Reality Bites” and “Before Sunrise.” As he's gotten older, he hasn't lost that sense of cool, but has brought it to older, wiser, and more seasoned characters, like the hip if immature father he brought to life in “Boyhood.” And, when Hawke departs from those types with roles he doesn't seem an obvious fit for, he shows that he's more than capable of shedding that image for something more severe, like with his transformative and stunning work in Paul Schrader's “First Reformed.”

Breaking through with 1989's “Dead Poets Society,” Hawke has also shown himself to have great taste in film roles, constantly choosing interesting projects that have kept him fairly prominent throughout his decades in Hollywood. His most consistent collaborator is Richard Linklater, with whom he first worked with for “Before Sunrise,” eventually co-writing the sequels to the film alongside his co-star Julie Delpy. He also worked with him on “Boyhood,” gaining much acclaim for his performance in the time-hopping coming-of-age drama. Through his career, he's starred in great films, co-wrote quite a few of them, and even directed a few of his own, including “Chelsea Walls,” “The Hottest State,” and the HBO Max documentary series “The Last Movie Stars.” And he's shown that his star power can translate to TV, where's he's given great performances in series like “Moon Knight” and especially “The Good Lord Bird.”

With Hawke starring in the new TV series “The Lowdown,” IndieWire has taken the liberty of going through his filmography to rank the best of his greatest performances. This list includes both movie roles and the rare TV appearance, including his work on “The Good Lord Bird” and “Reservation Dogs.” Read on for Ethan Hawke's 10 best performances, ranked.

A defining text of mid-'90s Gen X disenchantment, “Reality Bites” is not a particularly good movie: the characters are shrill and unlikable, the plot is preachy and basic, and Helen Childress' script has a smug, too-cool-for-school attitude that's aged horrendously after 30 years. Hawke doesn't necessarily escape the film's problems: his character, coffeehouse singer-songwriter Troy, is a thin stereotype of a hot '90s slacker, wildly unlikable despite the film wanting you to fall for him. That said, this is arguably the project that did the most to cement Hawke's star image, and there's undeniably appeal to his soulful, snarky performance, which shows real star quality that's downright nostalgic to see in a Hollywood production these days. His chemistry with Winona Ryder is almost enough to make their characters' romance work, even if the script keeps getting in the way.

An underseen gem, “Born to Be Blue” presents a semi-fictionalized look at the life of famed jazz trumpeter Chet Baker, focusing particularly on his recovery from a mugging incident in the '60s that lead to the destruction of his teeth and damaged his ability to play his beloved instrument. Hawke nearly played a younger version of Baker in a Richard Linklater film that never came to fruition; his performance in Robert Budreau's film is better for the experience and vulnerability he brings to the role with his age, despite his underlying boyish charm. Hawke learned to play the trumpet himself for the role, his inexperience with the instrument working with the context of Baker trying to recover from his accident, and nails a warbling, sensitive performance of the song “I've Never Been in Love Before.” The film doesn't sugercoat any of Baker's faults, from his neediness to his general immaturity, but Hawke is raw and sensitive enough that you want to forgive him all the same.

One of Hawke's most well-remembered films from the '90s, thanks in part to becoming a lazy day in high school science class staple watch, “Gattaca” is also an intelligent and thoughtful warning of the potential impact of eugenics, imagining a future where parents use genetic selection to conceive their children. For Hawke's Vincent Freeman, who was born without any genetic selection, that means a lifetime of discrimination, getting barred from high-paying work and his dreams of going to space being denied. But he gets a chance at a new life when he begins impersonating Jude Law's Jerome Morrow, a swim champion who was paralyzed in an accident. In an often chilly sci-fi film, the earthy Hawke is excellent casting: he's certainly attractive, but almost seems of an entirely different era than the unnaturally beautiful Law, with a wide-eyed sense of wonder that sells Vincent's very earnest dreams. Also, the set of the film is where Hawke met his former wife Uma Thurman, and the two share unsurprisingly great chemistry that gives the film's romance real charge. 

Hawke was just 18 years old when he broke through as the sweet, sensitive Todd in “Dead Poets Society,” Peter Weir's beloved coming-of-age drama about Robin Williams' John Keating, who inspires a group of dissatisfied boarding school boys to “seize the day” and pursue their passions. At his then-young age, the actor has much of the sensitivity that would make him a great performer later on his career, proving very believable as a shy, sheltered teen with low confidence who slowly emerges from his shell. Most importantly, he has excellent chemistry with Robert Sean Leonard as Todd's best friend Neil, developing a sweet friendship that makes the film's ultimate tragedy all the more painful. In an earnest, inspirational tearjerker, it's Hawke's performance that gives the story much of its emotional core.

“Reservation Dogs” is an incredible show for many reasons, with some of the best writing, direction, and acting of any series this decade. One of its greatest attributes, though, is its ability to expand beyond its central cast of four Native teens living on an Oklahoma reservation and flesh out the community around them, leading to a sprawling ensemble where every player has texture and humanity. For its penultimate episode, the show was even able to flex a bit by abandoning nearly the entire cast for a standalone story focusing on Elora (the phenomenal Devery Jacobs) as she locates the father she never met for financial information. Casting a movie star like Hawke in the role could feel like stunt casting, but it never feels like it watching “Elora's Dad”; he sinks into the lowkey, bittersweet tone of the show immediately, never overplaying the emotions that come from this reluctant reconnection. He's excellent with Jacobs in particular, his regretful sweetness contrasting beautifully with her spiky disposition, and making for one of a great show's very best episodes. It's an excellent preview of what Hawke and series creator Sterlin Harjo could accomplish in their followup collaboration “The Lowdown.”

Divisive at the time, and still today, Michael Almereyda's 2000 contemporary version of “Hamlet” is nonetheless one of the most interesting Shakespeare films ever made, transforming the classical tragedy into a paranoia-drenched sort of techno thriller about the evolving technology of the time and the feeling of being constantly under surveillance. Hawke's performance was also a bit divisive, rendering the Prince of Denmark as a mopey-eyed film student and heir to a major corporation, with many critics preferring the rest of the ensemble (most notably Julia Stiles' devastating Ophelia or Kyle MacLachlan's scheming Claudius). But his performance, which emphasizes the more pathetic parts of the Prince's nature, works well in this film's feverish context, sucking out the grandiosity of the character in favor of something petulant and infantile. It's not what you think of when you think of Shakespearean acting, but in a way, it's more honest and insightful about the character than many other renditions you've seen before. And when the film asks him to, Hawke delivers, with a sensitivity that makes Hamlet unmistakably human.

Famously filmed over the course of 11 years with production starting and stopping to track the coming-of-age of its main character, Richard Linklater's “Boyhood” derives a lot of pleasure from seeing how its ensemble of actors evolves over the years. Nowhere is that more evident than with Ethan Hawke's performance as Mason's (Ellar Coltrane) irresponsible, reckless father, semi-estranged from his kids at first after his divorce from their mother. Hawke was 32 with two very young kids of his own when production began; by the time it ended in 2013, he was in his forties, and the experience of raising his own children (and going through his own divorce) clearly seeped into the extra level of tenderness and sweetness he brought to the role. In a poignant film about the passage of time, watching Hawke transform his character from a wash-up to someone Mason can be proud to call his father makes for the most satisfying, moving arc.

Criminally underseen and underappreciated, “The Good Lord Bird” features Hawke playing an undersung American hero, abolitionist John Brown, who raided federal armories in an attempt to begin a slave revolt. Told from the point of view of Onion (Joshua Caleb Johnson), a fictional enslaved boy who joins Brown's soldiers, the show follows Brown's life with plenty of reverence, which could slide into hero-worshipping. But Hawke nails a tricky, difficult part: his Brown is bombastic and theatrical, prone to launching into sermons and speeches at a moment's notice, but with real conviction and purpose behind everything he says, and the actor never winks to the audience or undercuts the real sincere humanity behind Brown's beliefs. It's an astonishingly ferocious portrait of revolutionary fire packed with adrenaline. 

Nothing about the “Before” trilogy of films, Richard Linklater's opus about an American man and a French woman who meet by chance on a train and their two-decade-ish love story, would work if the stars didn't have the type of lightning-in-a-bottle chemistry casting directors dream of. It took the director nine months to finalize casting for the characters of Jesse and Céline for “Before Sunrise,” before he eventually got Hawke and Julie Delpy together for a final reading. In the film that resulted, the two have such a swoony, instant spark that you can understand exactly why they would fall for each other immediately, and both have a perfect handle on the bantering, erudite, circular dialogue that the movie is built upon. Over two sequels, the characters' relationship got to grow more complicated, and it's a joy to see the actors' grow with their characters. Hawke, deep in his dreamy Gen X heartthrob era in the first film, manages to keep the traits that make Jesse unique — his swagger, intelligence, playfulness — while also showing his evolution from immature young man to older, flawed husband. And when Hawke smashes the big blowout fight between Jesse and Céline that “Before Midnight” builds up to out of the park, you get the sense that his younger self from the first film wouldn't have been capable of delivering it.

Hawke, remarkably, was not Oscar-nominated for his performance in “First Reformed,” his finest work as an actor. Had Paul Schrader's morally murky psychological thriller received more critical attention, he very well could have (and probably should have) won. He's that great as Reverend Ernst Toller, the minister of a small historical church in Upstate New York whose worldview is shaken when he provides spiritual council to a radical environmentalist and his pregnant wife. With a deep set brow of worry and stiff body posture, Hawke ably conveys the image of a man haunted by his past actions and with deep convictions for how to repent. With Toller such an internal character, we chart most of his change not through words or actions, but through Hawke's face, how his eyes flash with shock, doubt, anger, and disgust. When Toller makes his final choice at the end of the film, it's thanks to Hawke's work that it's not shocking at all. Few actors have been capable of a performance as spiritually distraught as this.

UPDATE 9/24: “The Savant” star Jessica Chastain in an Instagram statement made clear that she is “not aligned” with Apple on the studio's decision to delay the show, though she respects their decision to do so and admires their partnership. She explains that “I've never shied away from difficult subjects, and while I wish this show wasn't so relevant, unfortunately it is.” 

Chastain's full statement reads: “I want to say how much I value my partnership with Apple. They've been incredible collaborators and I deeply respect their team. That said, I wanted to reach out and let you know that we're not aligned on the decision to pause the release of ‘The Savant.' In the last five years since we've been making the show, we've seen an unfortunate amount of violence in the United States: the kidnapping attempt on Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer; the January 6th attack on the Capitol; the assassination attempts on President Trump; the political assassinations of Democratic representatives in Minnesota; the attack on Speaker Pelosi's husband; the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk; the recent shooting at an ABC affiliate station in California; and over 300 school shootings across this country. These incidents, though far from encompassing the full range of violence witnessed in the United States, illustrate a broader mindset that crosses the political spectrum and must be confronted. I've never shied away from difficult subjects, and while I wish this show wasn't so relevant, unfortunately it is. ‘The Savant' is about the heroes who work every day to stop violence before it happens, and honoring their courage feels more urgent than ever. While I respect Apple's decision to pause the release for now, I remain hopeful the show will reach audiences soon. Until then, I'm wishing safety and strength for everyone, and I'll let you know if and when ‘The Savant' is released.

Original story follows: The anxiety around the political and cultural reaction to the killing of Charlie Kirk is so high that we could see more media companies on edge about how audiences react to their content. “The Savant,” a limited series starring Jessica Chastain originally set to premiere this Friday on Apple TV+, will be postponed, a rep for Apple TV+ told IndieWire.

 










While no specific reason was given, nor was any new release date announced, it's believed that current events contributed to the delay.

“After careful consideration, we have made the decision to postpone ‘The Savant.' We appreciate your understanding and look forward to releasing the series at a future date,” Apple TV+ said in a statement. 

“The Savant” stars Chastain as a woman who infiltrates online extremist groups in an attempt to discover mass shootings and extremist acts of terrorism before they happen. The series was created by Melissa James Gibson and was inspired by a 2019 article in Cosmopolitan, “Is It Possible to Stop a Mass Shooting Before It Happens?” 

The first trailer for the series, which you can watch below, shows her engaging online with extremists, attempting to think like them and expose their actions before reporting them to the authorities. It shows a series of “snipers, bombings, ambushes” — with Chastain specifically trying to bring down someone who wants to make an imprint on history with the type of event people refer to “with a month and a date.” It's also a show that grapples with Chastain's moral dilemma of wondering if it's right to be engaging with such people, even if it's in the name of a greater good.

“The Savant” would not be the first time a show or an episode was delayed in order to provide some breathing room from real-life tragedies. But the fervor over “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” being pre-empted last week (it comes back on air tonight) is likely just the first example of media companies in this very moment looking closely at what's being said and represented on their screens as showrunners reach for the headlines with politically relevant commentary and entertainment.

A 66-year-old two-time Oscar winner who's still near the height of her powers and has presumably made enough money for her grandkids to retire at birth, Emma Thompson could spend the rest of her life guest-starring on British TV shows and sleeping in her own bed at night and no one would think any less of her. But actors have to act (we love them for that, and that for them), and even a screen icon of Thompson's cachet is powerless to pass up the prospect of saying dialogue like “Freakin' fiddlesticks shitBUNS!” in a Marge Gunderson-thick Brainerd accent.

 










So while the rest of us might have been happy to stay warm at home, Thompson hoofed it out to the snowy wilds of Finland in order to film “Dead of Winter,” a programmatic but tightly plotted thriller — set amidst a brutal Minnesota blizzard — in which she plays a widowed ice fisher who asks the wrong guy for directions on the way to a certain lake (he's not quite in the middle of feeding a human body into a wood chipper, but he might as well be). Hardly a scene goes by where Thompson isn't beaten, chased, and/or shot at in sub-zero temperatures, but you get the sense that all of the frostbite in the world couldn't have stopped her from getting her own little taste of “Fargo.” 

 








Related Stories Harris Dickinson Curates Roxy Film Series Ahead of His Directing Debut ‘Urchin': Varda, Tarkovsky, and More ‘Slow Horses' Season 5 Is an Invigorating Rebuke to Anti-Intellectualism Amid a World Gone Mad 

That passion — that enduring sense of purpose — is reflected across the course of a small but satisfying movie about people who are either desperate for something to live for, or living only for their desperation. If only they could find a way forward for themselves. Barb Sorenson (Thompson) is looking for precisely that when she heads out into the cold for a day on the ice. All “Minnesota nice” and quiet sorrow, she planned to start her search at a fishing spot that was especially meaningful to her late husband; the only problem is that she can't find it. 

So she asks Camo Jacket — as Marc Menchaca's oafishly menacing character is identified in the credits — to point her in the right direction, even though he doesn't seem like the most trustworthy fella. Minutes later, after Barb's truck breaks down, she watches Camo Jacket hunt down and hand-tie a young woman (Laurel Madsen) who escaped from his house. In lieu of anything else to do with herself, Barb decides to intervene. But sneaking into Camo Jacket's basement and stealing the girl won't be easy, because Camo Jacket is married to Purple Lady (played by a rifle-toting Judy Greer, a fentanyl lollipop always lodged in her mouth), and she isn't quite as helpless as her husband. 

 










Directing from a lean and functional script by Nicholas Jacobson-Larson and Dalton Leeb, Brian Kirk (“21 Bridges”) maneuvers these four characters around each other with care and a clear eye for tension. The action is taut, the stakes are clear, and Kirk never misses a chance to remind us that all of these are just regular people who've crossed paths in a dark place. These are humble Americans more accustomed to baiting fish than shooting humans, and while that may not excuse all of the thriller cliches this movie indulges when push comes to shove during its do-or-die third act (i.e. someone running out of ammo right when they've lined up a certain kill shot), every Coen brothers-esque blunder reinforces the idea that these characters have been forcibly diverted from the lives they were meant to live.

To that end, the movie's greatest conflict might be that between their folksy earnestness and their flinty desperation, and it's a conflict that every member of the cast is able to articulate within themselves without resorting to caricature. The mystery as to why Purple Lady and Camo Jacket have kidnapped a suicidal woman is too opaque at first (something to do with organ harvesting, it seems?), and then too impractical by the end (she's getting a doctor to do what?), but Greer always shines as a self-interested villain, and she manages to sell the absolute shit out of an unscrupulous woman who's doing what she has to in order to survive. You may not believe in the full scope of her character's circumstances, but not for a second will you doubt the wincing sincerity of her “sorry, not sorry” attitude toward saving her own skin. 

 










Greer's Purple Jacket makes a terrific foil for Thompson's Barb, whose “aw shucks” affect is pointed towards risking her life for a perfect stranger. Recurring flashbacks — in which a younger Barb is embodied by Thompson's own daughter Gaia Wise — do more to disrupt the film's suspense than to meaningfully complicate its protagonist, but the most impactful of these glimpses into her marriage offer some insight into the various roles she hoped to play over the course of her life (wife, mother, entrepreneur, etc.), and hint at the difficulties that have come from being recast against her will. 

If Thompson exudes too much tenacity for us to need such labored glimpses into her character's past, the extra insight makes it that much easier to buy her character's transformation into a badass good Samaritan, and “Dead of Winter” never loses sight of what its backwoods shenanigans mean to Barb on a deeper level. People will do anything to survive, but a life without purpose can be worse than death; watching Emma Thompson bleed, shiver, and shoot her way through a movie this cold is proof enough of that.

Vertical Entertainment will release “Dead of Winter” in theaters on Friday, September 26.

What can't Harris Dickinson do? He's an actor, a Beatle, a babygirl, a writer/director, and now a film curator.

His feature directing debut, “Urchin,” opens from 1-2 Special in New York and Los Angeles on October 10 before expanding nationwide on October 17. Ahead of the IndieWire-raved film starring Frank Dillane as a self-destructive London drifter, the Roxy Cinema in downtown Manhattan will host Harris Dickinson Selects. Dickinson himself curated the film series to invite audiences “inside the visual and emotional landscape that helped shape his first feature film,” per the Roxy. IndieWire shares more exclusive details below.

“Harris Dickinson has quietly built a reputation as one of the most nuanced actors of his generation.,” Roxy also wrote of the breakout “Triangle of Sadness” and “Beach Rats” actor. “With ‘Urchin,' Dickinson steps behind the camera, proving he's just as compelling a storyteller as he is a performer. The film follows a [young man] navigating life on the fringes of society in coastal Britain, balancing harsh realism with poetic introspection. It's a deeply personal work — one that feels both intimate and cinematically ambitious.”

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






From IndieWire's review of “Urchin”: “Dickinson's lithe and tetchy script only feigns at a clean hero's journey in order to undercut it with the chaos of human behavior, and what might have been a nice three-act story about a moppet on the mend sours into something far less digestible or instructive.”

The series includes films by Agnès Varda, Andrei Tarkovsky, and more. More details below.

“Vagabond” (dir. Agnès Varda)

A portrait of a young woman's solitary journey through rural France, told with Varda's trademark blend of realism and lyricism. Screening Wednesday, September 24 in 35mm.

“Nil by Mouth” (dir. Gary Oldman)

A raw, wrenching look at addiction and violence in South London—gritty, unflinching, and deeply compassionate. Screening Thursday, September 25 in 35mm.

“Andrei Rublev” (dir. Andrei Tarkovsky)

An epic meditation on art, faith, and suffering. Dickinson cites it as a major influence on his sense of rhythm and atmosphere. Screening Friday, September 26 in 35mm.

“Manila in the Claws of Light” (dir. Lino Brocka)

A politically charged neorealist masterpiece that follows a young man navigating poverty, exploitation, and disillusionment in 1970s Manila. Its stark beauty and social urgency resonate deeply with the themes of Urchin. Harris will introduce the Thursday, October 9 screening.

September 24, 2025

In the beginning was her wit. Before she became an object of curiosity to one stratum of America and a harbinger of certain moral calamity to another, Cardi B was just a regular girl from the Bronx whose ambitions of future success did not hinge on a career in rap. In fact, they didn't include music at all. It was a manager, from whom she subsequently split and later defeated in a breach of contract suit, who had the vision. When he overheard Cardi artfully cuss a boyfriend over the phone, it signaled there might be more lucrative ways for the college student turned stripper turned social media star to use her words. Within two years, Cardi got to No. 1 with “Bodak Yellow.” Within three, she had released her debut, Invasion of Privacy, the album that would earn her a Grammy. It may have been someone else who originated her rap dreams, but it was Cardi who actualized them.

Seven years later, there are glimpses of what that manager must have peeped: Cardi's righteous fury unleashes her brilliance. AM I THE DRAMA? has a mission, or at least a theme: revenge. Her knack for holding a grudge has already been twice immortalized. But on the album cover, Cardi uses a visual motif to underscore the message: recast from hood princess to Disneyesque villain, she poses with a pair of crows; a murder hovers in the background. Crows, like elephants and tigers, have long-term memories and the ability to recognize human faces. They, too, will beef a bitch forever. (Incidentally, in one research study, crows' vengeful caws were at their most aggressive precisely seven years in.) Across 23 songs, she exacts several years' worth of whackings, breaking only to grieve, flex, or flirt.

Cardi's isn't the first voice on AM I THE DRAMA?; nor is it the second or the third. “Dead” opens with a flash-forward to a scene presumably fantasizing about the album's aftermath: news clips describe a killing spree targeting “bloggers and journalists” and “several female rappers,” and warn that the suspect, one Cardi B, is at large. Summer Walker, in the first of two guest appearances, narrates criminal intent: “I know they heard a bitch was coming and they scared/I wanna pull the lace fronts off they heads/I want all these bitches dead.“ When the fearsome accused finally surfaces, she antagonizes and laments, before concluding, “I tried to come in peace, they tore me into pieces/Now I gotta R-I-P it.” Not for the last time, Cardi's delivery rescues her from the cliche.

AM I THE DRAMA? acknowledges the stylistic transformation of New York rap, with production largely in the hands of Sean Island and DJ SwanQo. But Cardi maintains a respectful distance from the prevailing trends. Instead, she plays with bursts of experimentation, adopting new flows without sacrificing legibility. “Pretty & Petty” does double duty: The hook is readymade for ubiquity as a TikTok trend while the verses constitute one of the most punishing diss tracks of the year. She practically prances over the beat, a grittier, New York-ified take on the cadences and melodies associated with Mustard's L.A.

In the vein of Kendrick Lamar's “Not Like Us,” the apparent glee with which Cardi crushes Boston rapper Bia, four years into an escalating beef, magnifies the effect: “Name five Bia songs, gun pointin' to your head/Baow, I'm dead/That melatonin flow puttin' us to bed/I'm doing you a favor, Epic, run me my bread.” As if to prove her point, the song's release coincides with steep exponential growth of Google searches for Bia name. Devastating. The album is at its most enjoyable when Cardi is in this prickly mode: “Hello,” “Magnet,” the 2 Chainz-written “Salute.” The bilingual, Dyckman-ready “Bodega Baddie,” a turbo-charged merengue bop, makes a promise akin to Rihanna's mythical reggae album; at under two minutes, it's a brief glimpse at a worthwhile style for Cardi to linger on.

It's been a long seven years. Exercises in catharsis abound in the form of heartbreak songs, recorded in the shadow of divorce. With few exceptions, these are grating rap ballads on which even the specifics of a toxic relationship feel generic. The default formula of a sung chorus registers as vacant, even when entrusted with the capable Summer Walker, Lizzo, and Kehlani. Cardi joins many of her streaming-era peers in shunning the self-editing that made Invasion of Privacy, at 13 songs, effective. That work, when offloaded to the listener under the guise of generosity, lands instead as risk aversion.

In certain realms of pop, the songwriting process has become a compacted, impenetrable underbrush, with observers desperate to gather more meaning from a list of song credits than is actually possible. Cardi's lablelmate, Pardison Fontaine, remains a stubborn yet compatible presence and, with writing credits on 19 of 23 songs, her most consistent collaborator. For fans, this makes him a trustworthy creative partner; for skeptics, it damns Cardi as a talentless hack and Pardi her sub rosa crutch.

But, as she has herself articulated, Cardi's musical talent has not historically been that of an effortless generator of songs; what she has mastered, as a rapper and elsewhere, is locating an idea, seizing it, and transmuting it into something her own: a style of rap that is both outrageous and easily digestible, designed to travel well from the strip club to the Super Bowl. Always walking the line between edgy and accessible, Cardi summons the breakthrough of early aughts rap more than she does her contemporaries; this is the stuff of high-end recording studios, not improvised bedroom setups.

An ingenious cultural interpreter of sorts, Cardi transported the exclamatory trill “okurrr” from its drag origins to the late-night talk show circuit so effectively, and without any apparent sacrifice of authenticity, that it is often falsely attributed to her. “Am I the drama?” too, has its origins in drag. It was Scarlet Envy, as a contestant on RuPaul's Drag Race, who first wondered, cheekily, about her culpability. But, as an album, AM I THE DRAMA? seems to signal that, for Cardi, the question functions better as a rhetorical one: It doesn't really matter whether she's the drama; even if she didn't start it, Cardi will be the one to end it.

Tuesday night, September 23, marked Jimmy Kimmel's return to the air after Jimmy Kimmel Live! was pulled by ABC last week under pressure from the Trump administration. Kimmel had made a joke about the man alleged to have shot and killed right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, prompting Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair Brendan Carr to threaten the network, which is owned by the Walt Disney Company, with retaliation. Find Kimmel's complete opening monologue from his return below.

Kimmel took the stage to cheers of “Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!” He began by remarking, “I'm not sure who had a weirder 48 hours, me or the CEO of Tylenol,” and expressed his gratitude to his fellow late-night talk show hosts and the audience for their support. Kimmel made a point to thank conservative pundits and politicians including Ben Shapiro, Candace Owens, and Texas Senator Ted Cruz by name: “Even though I don't agree with many of those people on most subjects—some of the things they say even make me want to throw up—it takes courage for them to speak up against this administration, and they did and they deserve credit for it.”

Kimmel continued, “I do want to make something clear because it's important to me as a human, and that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man.” He also acknowledged CBS' recent cancellation of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. “I've had the opportunity to meet and spend time with comedians and talk show hosts from countries like Russia, countries in the Middle East,” Kimmel remarked. “Our freedom to speak is what they admire most about this country, and that's something I'm embarrassed to say I took for granted until they pulled my friend Stephen off the air and tried to coerce the affiliates who run our show in the cities you live in to take my show off the air. That's not legal; that's not American—that's un-American.”

At one point, Kimmel quoted a 2022 social media post from Brendan Carr during his tenure as FCC commissioner: “Political satire is one of the oldest and most important forms of free speech. It challenges those in power while humor to draw more people into the discussion. That's why people in influential positions have always targeted it for censorship.” A later segment featured Robert De Niro loosely impersonating the now-FCC chair—a reference to De Niro's role in Martin Scorsese's 1990 mob drama Goodfellas and a recent comment from Cruz comparing Carr to a “mafioso.”

Addressing his current relationship with the network, Kimmel said, “We talked it through, and, at the end, even though they didn't have to… they welcomed me back on the air. Unfortunately, and, I think, unjustly, this puts them at risk. The president of the United States made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs.” He concluded his monologue by discussing the speech given by Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, during a memorial service organized by Turning Point USA, the conservative organization the late activist co-founded: “On Sunday, Erika Kirk forgave the man who shot her husband. That is an example we should follow. If you believe in the teachings of Jesus, as I do, there it was. That's it. A selfless act of grace, forgiveness from a grieving widow. It touched me deeply. It touches many, and, if there's anything we should take from this tragedy to carry forward, it should be that, and not this.”

Notably, this evening's episode of Kimmel did not air on all ABC stations nationwide. The TV station groups Sinclair and Nexstar, which together control over 20 percent of the network's local affiliates, had previously announced that they would pre-empt the show indefinitely on their programming schedules. Nexstar is currently trying to close a $6.2 billion merger with a rival TV company that will require FCC approval.

Sarah McLachlan was the musical guest on Kimmel tonight. She performed a solo piano rendition of the title track from the new album Better Broken. McLachlan recently canceled her scheduled performance at the premiere event for Disney+'s Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery documentary, which took place on Sunday, September 21, “in support of free speech.” Watch her sing “Better Broken” below.

Listening to an Asher White record, you get the sense that she approaches songwriting like an interior designer. She treats her songs like rooms she can move throughout, rearranging their furniture—pushing the couch from one corner to another, angling a chair ever so slightly in a different direction. “The sink thank you,” which opens her latest album, 8 Tips for Full Catastrophe Living, comes together like move-in day, starting as an empty room with nothing but some muffled, tentative strings before other additions begin to fill the space: slot machine sound effects, snare drums, faraway chimes, a thumping bassline, keys that sound straight out of Fiona Apple's “Valentine,” a smattering of handclaps; until finally, White's delicate voice creeps in. At times, each instrument sounds like it belongs in a different song; sometimes there's a TV in the bathroom, a bed in the hallway, a bathtub in the kitchen. Yet somehow, they all make sense under the same roof.

White has a talent for melding elements that ought to sound out of place together, instead making them seem right at home. On average, she has released more than an album a year for the past decade, her work evolving from sound collages of field recordings to maximalist post-rock and chamber pop with electronic and orchestral elements. On 8 Tips for Full Catastrophe Living, she channels her dynamic soundscaping into an examination of interdependence, strained relationship dynamics, and labors of love.

An unnamed love interest reappears throughout these songs, acting as a foil to White's narrators as she explores gendered divides and public vs. private life. At the tremulous conclusion of “The sink thank you,” she offers remarks to a partner that are as glowing as they are pointed: “Did you clean the sink?/Thank you/I can't stand to love you all like this/And when I have a child/I will raise her to wake early like you.” The narrator's shortcomings are reflected back to her in the idealized traits of her lover, kicking off an album-length series of domestic misadventures both tragic and mundane.

On “Beers with my name on them,” White plays the housewife whose quiet dissatisfaction stirs underneath her placid demeanor. “There's a surprise waiting in the foyer/The fall of another personal empire today/I do the dishes/I do not shave my legs/And I wait for you to come home,” she sings in an angelic voice with Betty Draper-like repression, all while surrounded by tinfoily guitar feedback and a drumbeat that mimics the pummel of a washing machine on its highest spin setting. “Cobalt Room: Good Work / Silver Saab,” the record's seven-and-a-half-minute centerpiece, recalls the noisier, jam-based work of White's tourmates Deerhoof and Black Country, New Road. Then its industrial post-rock shatters into a jazzy breakdown while White's narrator yearns for domestic favors and physical affection: “Cobalt color, ugly room/Won't you paint it white for me?/Husband, if you come back soon/Won't you kiss me tenderly?”

These songs hold history like family heirlooms, revealing how inherited trauma persists in both momentary interpersonal interactions and generational disasters—like on “Travel safe,” which draws connections between White's Ukrainian Jewish ancestors seeking uncertain refuge in the United States and the people of Gaza who continue to be victims of manufactured famine, statelessness, and genocide. The track's wandering ambient instrumental reflects just how unstable the concept of home can be.

White floats deftly between post-rock sprawl, electronic experimentalism, and percussive folk. Like her forebears Sufjan Stevens and Fiona Apple, she's adept at dropping pop melodies into unexpected places and abandoning them at a moments' notice for messier or more atonal sounds. The record's most beautiful moments are also its most disconcerting: “Country Girls,” a track inspired by Clarice Lispector and Eve Babitz whose ghostly baroque-pop hoedown sounds as though it's on the verge of falling apart under the clatter of worn-down dancing shoes; or “Like another planet Instrumental,” a twinkly soundscape that plays out like a dream ballet, growing more cacophonous over its two-minute runtime until it abruptly ends. On 8 Tips for Full Catastrophe Living, no illusion goes unshattered; nothing on the record is allowed to sound too pretty without getting a bit fucked up. There is always more to the picture-perfect home than meets the eye.

Ratboys shared their last album, the Chris Walla–produced The Window, in 2023. Now, they're back with a new song and a new label home. Also co-produced with Walla, “Light Night Mountains All That” is the Chicago rock band's debut single for New West Records. Ratboys drummer Marcus Nuccio directed the accompanying music video. Watch it below.

“My original idea was to write an ultra-high energy folk song, in the style of the Dodos' Visiter, with somewhat spooky, mysterious, and pastoral lyrics—like what Chris Otepka of the Heligoats might conjure up on a mushroom trip,” Ratboys singer Julia Steiner said of the process behind the new single in a statement. “[The] guys and I nearly went insane fleshing out the arrangement and its odd timings together. I wrote the lyrics during that original demoing trip, centered around the idea of a fantastic, rural vision-quest where the days and nights blend together and nothing is quite as it seems.”

Ratboys have also announced a 2026 tour of North America, which kicks off February 25 in Detroit, Michigan and runs through mid-April. They're set to perform at Pitchfork Music Festival London this November, too. Scroll down to see all of Ratboys' upcoming shows.

Have you been paying attention to Bill Orcutt? For the last dozen-plus years, or since the 2011 release of the splenetic acoustic marvel How the Thing Sings, the San Francisco-based guitarist has been on one of the great creative tears in his chosen instrument's vaunted history. Whether alone, with a scattered cast of brazen collaborators, or quadrupling his own playing in an astonishing guitar quartet of one, Orcutt has been reshaping the emotional and technical terrain typically associated with instrumental guitar music. He cuts rage with wonder and laces joy with doubt as he splinters melodies and rebuilds them in uncanny new shapes, like a random-number generator that knows exactly what it's doing. Orcutt's music sometimes feels like some bewildering maze with multiple solutions, inviting you to return and find novel ways out; other times, as on last year's wonderful and unexpected duet with samples of Perry Como's crooning, How to Rescue Things, it suggests the borderlands between dreams and nightmares. For my record-buying money and time, no other guitarist this century has been so prolific and powerful.

Orcutt has a new rock band now. It is not some legacy-affirming return to the gloriously fucked chaos of Harry Pussy, his no-holds-barred noisenik band of the '90s. Orcutt Shelley Miller is, instead, a power trio with a rhythm section of heavyweights, suspended between rock'n'roll order and psychedelic oblivion. Drummer Steve Shelley was the secret source of stability in Sonic Youth for nearly three decades, the anchor that allowed their songs to plunge into dissonant voids and return to strangely jangly centers. That skill has become increasingly clear in the years since Sonic Youth's rupture, as Shelley has emerged as a sharp session drummer and versatile journeyman with the likes of Bush Tetras and Winged Wheel. Bassist Ethan Miller, meanwhile, played in Comets on Fire, the short-lived but brilliant psych band with a long tail of influence, and founded Howlin Rain, a wild crew that could have found crossover success in the '70s and '90s alike. It is a testament to Orcutt's magnificence that Miller—responsible for one of my absolute favorite guitar solos ever—has but four low strings here.

The trio recorded their five-track, self-titled debut onstage at Los Angeles experimental hub Zebulon in April 2024, during their first show together. Rather than launch into some completely free 30-minute foray, Orcutt, Shelley, and Miller work like a committed jazz crew, starting each song with an identifiable theme and then quickly pushing to figure out where else it might lead them. What's more, the entry points are identifiably classic rock. “An L.A. Funeral” first feels like Neil Young & Crazy Horse are trying another way into “Cortez the Killer.” Near the start of “A Long Island Wedding,” Miller's bass curls beneath Orcutt's ragged guitar in a way that tickles the memory of hearing “Oh! Sweet Nuthin'” for the first time.

But in both cases, they rapidly cut left. Orcutt begins to stutter, start, and stop only 40 seconds into “An L.A. Funeral,” his wild leaps between notes prompting Miller and Shelley to shift their approach and give him more space. “Wedding” is a gentle little drift for nearly two minutes, but, when Orcutt suddenly grabs a note and squeezes it like he's trying to strangle the truth from its squeal, Miller and Orcutt shift again, their linear rhythm becoming a circle, a pas de deux as they wait for their third to work through his rage. When he doesn't, they eventually join him for a rumble that makes me imagine old heads in front of the Zebulon stage, suddenly uncrossing their arms and opening up a pit. It's a glorious moment of carefully executed mayhem.

Time and again in these five tracks, it sounds as if Orcutt has reached the end of potential variations for whatever theme he's playing, like an outlaw outrunning the cops only to reach the edge of a towering cliff. But he finds unexpected ways to extend the thought, with Miller and Shelley always maneuvering to give him room to do so. Toward the end of the spring-loaded and jubilant “Unsafe at Any Speed,” for instance, the notes are so short, sharp, and fast that it seems like Orcutt will simply run out of stamina and space, a machine frying its own circuits. So he grabs one note, repeats it, and lets the band swing around him until they dive back into the theme together one last time.

Something similar happens six minutes into “Four-Door Charger,” when the riff and rhythm seem permanently stuck, a broken record that will never let the needle slip back into the groove. But as Orcutt finds his way out of the fix, Shelley and Miller quicken the pulse. You can almost hear them all sighing with relief, a collapse avoided and some catharsis found. Fellow Orcutt zealots may balk at the comparison, but it reminds me of so-called “Evil Phish,” a glorious condition in which an often sunny band follows guitarist Trey Anastasio into wonderfully dark recesses of sound. Together, they find exhilarating ways back into daylight.

A quarter-century ago, the first time I saw Sonic Youth, I bought a handmade book of poetry by Thurston Moore. It's called Fuck a Hippie … But Be a Punk, a heart drawn around the title like it's a credo to covet. I keep it not because it's particularly good (it's not, really, at all) but because of the false binary it perpetuates, that two of rock'n'roll's great countercultural sects are somehow dichotomous. Sonic Youth were often at their best when they morphed into the atonal jam band of my dreams. (Lee Ranaldo's candor about the Grateful Dead's influence in recent years has been a gift.) Howlin Rain shared a label with the Black Crowes. And at least in my experiences, the differences between the noise and jam scenes are only ones of scale, texture, and, sometimes, temperament. That gap closes a little bit with Orcutt Shelley Miller, a welcome trio that knows the way out and back in, too.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Deradoorian Joins Spotify Exodus, Pulling Music From Platform","https://pitchfork.com/news/deradoorian-joins-spotify-exodus-pulling-music-from-platform/","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 16:41:58 GMT","

Deradoorian is the latest artist to pull music from Spotify. The singer-songwriter and former Dirty Projectors member cited chief executive Daniel Ek's weapons investments—the main motive for the recent exodus—and alluded to recent online content accusing the platform of expanding its music usage rights. Spotify clarified in a statement that Spotify for Artists terms have not changed, and said those terms do not govern artists' music rights.

Many of Deradoorian's albums have already been taken down from Spotify but, she noted, remain available to stream and buy elsewhere. Her statement begins, “Since Spotify came along, I have always felt skeptical and opposed to their platform. Because it became the norm, I felt like I had to just put up with it and take what I could get. Perhaps that was true more so in the nascent stages of my solo career, but it doesn't feel that way now.” She added that Ek's investment in the artificial-intelligence weapons contractor Helsing prompted her to dig into other issues around the platform, such as the way Spotify uses artists' music. The “slow erosion,” she wrote, of “our perceived ownership over our music—and the way its profits were used—was now too egregious to ignore.” Deradoorian admitted she did not conduct intensive research but said, “We all know that Spotify practices bad business. So, I just made the choice to stop it.”

In an email, a Spotify spokesperson said: “You might be seeing some misinformation online about a ‘change' to the Spotify for Artists' Terms of Use. These claims are false.” The spokesperson clarified that confusion about music usage rights revolves around a phrase that appears prominently in its terms of use: “user content.” That refers not to artists' music but to listener content: “things like listener-created playlist covers, podcast comments, and playlist titles,” according to the statement. Terms of use for listeners—not artists—were recently updated, the spokesperson added.

Last week, Massive Attack became the biggest artist yet to announce its departure from Spotify, primarily citing Ek's investment in Helsing. They also shared a separate statement about joining No Music for Genocide, which calls for artists to geoblock their music in Israel. (Spotify for Artists has clarified that Helsing is not involved in Gaza.) The band joined an exodus that includes Hotline TNT, Young Widows, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, WU LYF, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, Xiu Xiu, and Deerhoof.

For the avoidance of doubt, Deradoorian concludes her statement, “I do not support AI technology that's built to spy on us, create weapons to kill us, and utilize psychological tactics to dumb us down to the point of not questioning our reality and devolving our neural connections. It's important to employ your mental faculties and ability to question in these times and I am trying harder to do that more consistently.”

	President Donald Trump cannot pronounce “acetaminophen” — not on the first try, at least. He does, however, feel he is qualified to tell American women that if they take it during pregnancy they might give their children autism.


	The declaration came during a joint press event on Monday. Trump — flanked by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Dr. Mehmet Oz — said that “effective immediately” the Food and Drug Administration “will be notifying physicians that the use of acetaminophen,” commonly sold under the brand name Tylenol, “during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism.” 


	Trump told reporters that he was dispensing vaccine advice based on “common sense” and “what I feel,” and the administration's new guidance on Tylenol similarly does not seem to be based on science. No established link exists between acetaminophen — one of the most common and effective pain and fever reduces in the world — and Autism Spectrum Disorders. The existing body of research is limited, contradictory, and difficult to replicate. The president, who once suggested using bleach to kill Covid-19, and Kennedy, a raw milk evangelist who seems allergic to academic research, are nevertheless charging ahead with the dubious advice. 

	











	“Taking Tylenol is not good,” Trump claimed, contradicting decades of data indicating it is perfectly safe. “Don't take Tylenol. Don't take it. Fight like hell not to take it.” he said, suggesting women simply “tough it out” through pain or fever during pregnancy. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Kennedy added that “clinical laboratory studies” suggested a “potential association between acetaminophen used during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.”


	Autism researchers and obstetrics experts were appalled. 


	“Paracetamol (acetaminophen) does not cause autism, ADHD, or learning disabilities,” Dr. Monique Botha, associate professor in social and developmental psychology at Durham University, tells Rolling Stone. “That is something that I can confidently say.”

	Botha, whose work and research focuses on Autism Spectrum Disorders, adds that the studies suggesting correlation — not causation — did not control for things like genetics and family history: “As soon as you control for those things, any correlation like that essentially disappears.” It's a reality even the FDA acknowledged in its announcement of the administration's new guidance. “It is important to note that while an association between acetaminophen and neurological conditions has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature,” the FDA wrote in its public statement. 


	Kennedy has, for decades now, promoted claims that vaccines are responsible for increased rates of autism diagnoses in children, a phenomenon experts agree is more closely related to increased awareness and ability to identify the condition. In April, Kennedy publicly vowed to conduct a “massive testing and research effort” through HHS to find the causes of Autism Spectrum Disorders. “By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we'll be able to eliminate those exposures,” Kennedy said at the time.


	Botha notes that the causes of autism have been researched for decades, and largely point to a multi-factor originating largely based on biology — not pharmaceutical exposure. “There's plenty of research, decades of research. If you said I had to nail myself to one answer, I would say that it is primarily genetic and inheritable.”

	What's more concerning in Botha's view is that the administration's description of Autism Spectrum Disorders as an “epidemic” — as something to pin blame for and eliminate — is dehumanizing language that veers into eugenics. 


	“Autistic people are dehumanized, we know that from other research, as well,” Botha says. “This adds to that dehumanization, because it's this obsession with ‘Why do you exist? Why are you here?' It adds to this persistent feeling that autistic people report on, which is that they know that society would rather they did not exist. … Autistic people and their families, are deserving of respect, are deserving of adequate support, this is the last thing those families need” 

	











	Botha notes that the majority of monetary funding for autism research and resources tend to be directed towards finding the mythical single cause of the condition, instead of providing material support to autistic people and their families, or improving the public's understanding of the disorder.  The National Institute of Health on Monday announced a $50 million Autism Data Science Initiative to “unlock the causes and improve outcomes.” 


	Eric Garcia, journalist at The Independent and author of We're Not Broken: Changing the Autism Conversation, tells Rolling Stone that Kennedy is leading a “really a return to the blame game around autism.” 


	“Is it the vaccines? Is it the mold? Is it the Tylenol? It's looking for someone to blame. But that doesn't do anything — that doesn't fix anything for autistic people. If anything, it distracts from the ability to rebuild the world for autistic people and heal the world for them,” Garcia says.


	In the absence of actual science, the president offered up mad-libs rambling falsely insisting that communities that refuse to take “pills” or that avoid vaccines have nonexistent rates of Autism. 


	“I think I can say that there are certain groups of people that don't take any vaccines or don't take any pills that have no autism,” he said on Monday. “You have certain groups, the Amish, as an example, they have essentially no autism.” Trump added that “there's a rumor” that there is “virtually no autism” in Cuba because “they don't have money for Tylenol.” (This is false.)


	It is clear to Garcia that the administration “wanted to find something” to fulfill its public promises, and was willing to throw out whatever they could find — in this case, blaming acetaminophen.


	On Tuesday, the World Health Organization issued a statement clarifying that there is “inconsistent” evidence on the matter, and that the “lack of replicability [for past studies] really calls for caution in drawing casual conclusions.”


	The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), meanwhile, affirmed that they had not changed their recommendations of the use of acetaminophen by pregnant women, and considered it safe. (Last year, researchers at Drexel University conducted a large-scale study of 2.5 million births in Sweden between 1995 to 2019, and found no direct causal risk related to the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy.)


	“Suggestions that acetaminophen use in pregnancy causes autism are not only highly concerning to clinicians but also irresponsible when considering the harmful and confusing message they send to pregnant patients, including those who may need to rely on this beneficial medicine during pregnancy,” ACOD President Steven J. Fleischman wrote in a statement. “Acetaminophen is one of the few options available to pregnant patients to treat pain and fever, which can be harmful to pregnant people when left untreated. … The conditions people use acetaminophen to treat during pregnancy are far more dangerous than any theoretical risks and can create severe morbidity and mortality for the pregnant person and the fetus.” 

	











	In a statement provided to Rolling Stone, Kenvue — the manufacturer of Tylenol — indicated their belief that “independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned about the health risks and confusion this poses for expecting mothers and parents.” 


	“The facts are that over a decade of rigorous research, endorsed by leading medical professionals and global health regulators, confirms there is no credible evidence linking acetaminophen to autism,” Kenvue continued. “We stand with the many public health and medical professionals who have reviewed this science and agree.” 


	Public health experts, research, and medical professionals have long been struggling to compete with outright falsehoods being broadcast at max volume from the most powerful political office on the planet. “It's demoralizing,” Botha says.


	Even more demoralizing than the lies and stigma being promoted by the president may be the callousness with which he presents them. At one point during Monday's press conference, Trump took one of his rhetorical detours into a complaint about Ozempic, which he says he calls “the fat drug,” and how it's cheaper overseas because the U.S. is “subsidizing the rest of the world” but it's “nothing compared to autism.”

Jimmy Kimmel Live returned last night after a week-long suspension, much to the delight of the general public. One person who was not a fan, however, was Donald Trump. 


	The president responded to Jimmy Kimmel's comeback with a rant on Truth Social, declaring that he intends to sue the late-night show's network. “I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back,” Trump wrote. “The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‘talent' was never there.”


	He continued, “Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who's not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE. He is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers! Let Jimmy Kimmel rot in his bad Ratings.”

	











	Last week, ABC and Disney abruptly suspended the long-running late-night series, citing an “ill-timed and thus insensitive” monologue in which the comedian criticized right-wingers for trying to “score political points” off the murder of Charlie Kirk. Jimmy Kimmel kept quiet in the days that followed, while Hollywood raised its voice on his behalf.

	During his monologue last night, Kimmel thanked his many supporters, including “the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway.” He acknowledged, emotionally, that “it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man.”

	











	The host also criticized the Trump administration's attempts to pull him from the air. “I barely paid attention in school, but one thing I did learn from Lenny Bruce and George Carlin and Howard Stern is that a government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn't like is anti-American,” he said. “And I am so glad we have some solidarity on that from the right and the left and from those in the middle, like Joe Rogan, maybe the silver lining from this is we found one thing we can agree on, and maybe we'll even find another one. Maybe we can get a little bit closer together.”

	With Jimmy Kimmel Live, FCC chairman Brendan Carr claimed that Kimmel was attempting to push the narrative that Kirk's shooter “was somehow a MAGA or Republican-motivated person,” again calling it “sick.” Carr's contributions to the fragmented framing of the monologue allowed the pressure campaign from the Trump administration, as well as conservatives in the media, to take deeper root.

	Kimmel and Trump have had a long-standing feud, and both often take shots at each other publicly. Last year while hosting the Oscars, Kimmel read one of Trump's Truth Social posts during the ceremony, quipping, “Thank you, President Trump. Thank you for watching, I'm surprised you're still up — isn't it past your jail time?” Trump later called Kimmel a “dope” and “one of the dumbest human beings ever.”


	In April, Kimmel told Rolling Stone he enjoys amping Trump up. “I think most comedians have a strong sense of justice, and he violates that so frequently,” Kimmel said. “I know we should be hardened to it by now, but I'm not. It is shocking to me; it seems like a comic-book villain. He seems like the kind of character that would flame out after a few years, but the fact that he's still with us is remarkable. A year ago, I would've said I'm hoping to show people who aren't paying attention to the news what's actually going on, and hoping to change things that way. Obviously, that didn't have enough impact before the election, so now I see myself more as a place to scream.”

	Three individuals were shot at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas on Wednesday morning. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that “ICE law enforcement was not injured.” Two migrant detainees were killed and a third is in critical condition, according to DHS.


	In a preliminary assessment given to CNN, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons indicated that the shooter was a suspected sniper that had died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. 


	The facility is not an ICE detention center, but a short-term processing facility for recently detained migrants. In a post on social media, Dallas police wrote that “the preliminary investigation determined that a suspect opened fire at a government building from an adjacent building. Two people were transported to the hospital with gunshot wounds. One victim died at the scene. The suspect is deceased.” 


	An FBI official said the bureau had “seen from rounds that were found near the suspected shooter contain messages that are anti-ICE in nature.” Donald Trump's FBI Director Kash Patel posted an image of several rounds, one of which appeared to say “ANTI-ICE” on it.

	“While the investigation is ongoing, an initial review of the evidence shows an idealogical [sic] motive behind this attack,” Patel wrote on X, adding, “These despicable, politically motivated attacks against law enforcement are not a one-off.”


	Other members of the Trump administration quickly linked the attack to violence against law enforcement.

	











	“While we don't know [the] motive yet, we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them. It must stop,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X.

	Vice President J.D. Vance wrote in a separate post that “the obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop. I'm praying for everyone hurt in this attack and for their families.”


	In a statement issued Wednesday afternoon, Noem said, “For months, we've been warning politicians and the media to tone down their rhetoric about ICE law enforcement before someone was killed. This shooting must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences. Comparing ICE day-in and day-out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences.”

	Four months after news broke that she and Jason Isbell were divorcing, Amanda Shires opened a pair of concerts for Isbell in Colorado. The singer-songwriter, who addresses the end of her marriage and the reclamation of her independence on her new album, Nobody's Girl, says she played the gigs simply because she always keeps her word.


	“They were booked early on and confirmed, and the deals were inked, as they say,” Shires tells Rolling Stone on this week's Nashville Now podcast. “I always do what I say I'm going to do, always.”

A post shared by Rolling Stone Nashville Now (@rscountry)


	Onstage at Red Rocks Amphitheatre on night one in May 2024, Shires changed the words to her song “Stupid Love” to allude to her now-ex-husband's dental work. She says she wasn't jabbing at him, but rather making an observation that Shires says was overblown.


	“Some of the things I said on that first show were kind of taken out of context. And Jason was there and he knew what I said and how things came across. They got sensationalized,” she says.

	











	“When I sang that song ‘Stupid Love' … I changed it that night to ‘You're smiling so much you kissed me with your crooked teeth,'” she continues. “They thought I was making fun of him, but I was trying to make a separation, like, I never kissed the new teeth — I kissed the old teeth.”

	Shires releases Nobody's Girl on Friday, Sept. 26. “The past two years of my life have made it to where I feel like I can talk about anything, at this point,” she told Rolling Stone earlier this year. “I have always used music as a way to explain what's going on in my life to myself. And it was a big transition to go from, you know, having been in a marriage for a long time and to suddenly find that I'm not. It takes a lot of learning and self-reflection and, for me, a lot of time to process.”

	A process server was arrested after allegedly attempting to serve Taylor Swift deposition papers on behalf of Justin Baldoni's lawyers amid the ongoing legal feud between Baldoni and Blake Lively.


Star was first to report the news, stating that Justin Lee Fisher, 48, was caught on Sept. 15 at Kelce's gated property in Leawood, Kansas. According to the outlet, incident details were missing from the one-page police report, which allegedly stated, “This information is restricted as to use and dissemination.”


	In a Kansas Standard Offense Report filed by the Leawood Police Department on Sept. 15 and obtained by Rolling Stone, two individuals were named for the offense of “criminal trespass property” at Kelce's address. One is a male named Drew Bossi, another is a woman named Laura Baker. The redacted report excludes ages, contact information, addresses, and more. It does not include a victim and the property loss section is also blank. It is unclear what each of the individual's involvement was or was not in the process server incident, but the report took place around the same time and date at Kelce's property.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Local station KCTV 5 reported that the address listed in the report matches the address from which Kansas City Chiefs' memorabilia had been stolen last October (when both Kelce and Patrick Mahomes' residences were burglarized during a home game). Fisher was reportedly charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing and released after posting bond; he is expected to appear in the Leawood Municipal Court on Oct. 15.

	











	The arrest appears to have occurred just days after a federal judge denied Baldoni's request to depose Swift as the It Ends With Us director prepares for a trial over Lively's sexual harassment and smear campaign claims against Baldoni.


	U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman's order arrived after Baldoni's lawyer, Ellyn S. Garofalo, alleged in a letter to the court that Swift had “agreed” to appear for deposition but was unable to do so before Oct. 20. The letter requested an extension of the Sept. 30 discovery deadline to accommodate the singer's schedule.

	Swift's lawyer refuted the claim. “As counsel for the parties know, since the inception of this matter, we have consistently maintained that my client has no material role in this action,” Swift's attorney J. Douglas Baldridge said in a letter to the judge. Baldridge made it clear that Swift “did not agree to a deposition,” but if she was “forced,” she had informed Baldoni's camp that her schedule was too busy to accommodate it before Oct. 20.


	While Baldridge didn't explain what the conflict was, Swift has been gearing up for the release of her new album, The Life of a Showgirl, set to release Oct. 3.

	In May, a rep for Swift criticized Baldoni's initial attempts to subpoena the singer. “Taylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film,” the rep previously told Rolling Stone. 


This article was updated on Sept. 24 at 12:41 p.m. to include two individuals who were named in a Kansas Standard Offense Report filed by the Leawood Police Department for the offense of “criminal trespass property” at the address connected to Kelce on Sept. 15.

The Jersey Shore's Hit Music Channel

If you spent any time looking in the skies over New Jersey in late summer, there was a pretty good chance you saw a UFO.

Whether you call them a UFO or the more current term, UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena), it was an active late summer for them in New Jersey.

One of the most well-known websites for reporting sightings is The National UFO Reporting Center. From the beginning of August to late September, eight sightings were reported in the skies of New Jersey.

Let's find out if any of the flying objects reported were anywhere near your house on those late summer nights.

Saw a pale colored orb, not metallic, travel smoothly from south to north, just over the tree line.

That's the chilling report from an eyewitness in Wayne, who witnessed the object on the afternoon of August 12.

Here are some of the other towns with reported sightings this August and September. There were reports in  Ramsey, Rahway, Windslow, Hightstown, Margate City, Hopatcong, and Somerville.

The eyewitness account from Winslow Township was especially startling. Here are the words of the eyewitness.

Low rumbling, house started shaking, craft was flying extremely low

In case you're wondering, Winslow Township is in Camden County, so hopefully, that's not too close to your house.

There have been 36 UFO sightings reported to the National UFO Reporting Center from New Jersey residents in 2025.

A statement from a national organization of architects regarding the alleged misuse of the word “architect” in negative news contexts has sparked discussion among Filipinos.

The United Architects of the Philippines (UAP) released an open letter, saying it “strongly denounces the persistent misuse of the word ‘architect'” when “describing masterminds of plunder, corruption, crime, or other negative acts.” It was signed by its national president, architect Jonathan Manalad.

“Recent headlines and articles — such as referring to a government official as an ‘architect of plunder' — reflect a long-standing trend of equating the word ‘architect' with the mastermind of wrongdoings,” the organization said on Tuesday, September 23.

Recent headlines in the Philippines have focused on alleged corruption in flood control projects, with claims that government officials and lawmakers received kickbacks from these initiatives.

“This is not only misleading but gravely unjust to a profession that has, for centuries, been dedicated to the highest ideals of public service, safety, progress, and nation building,” the UAP added.

It also shared the definition of an architect as stated by the Architecture Act of 2004, which it said is “is a person professionally and academically qualified, registered, and licensed under the law, with the authority to practice architecture and responsible for the planning, design, construction, enlargement, conservation, renovation, remodeling, or alteration of buildings and the environment for human habitation.”

“Words matter,” the group said, adding that using “architect” in news reports as a synonym for ‘mastermind of crime' supposedly “corrodes public perception of the profession, trivializes years of education, licensure, and ethical responsibility, and undermines the trust that architects have worked hard to earn from the Filipino people.”

The UAP suggested that the media use words or phrases like “mastermind,” “perpetrator,” or “brains behind corruption” instead.

“The United Architects of the Philippines calls on government agencies, private institutions, and media outlets to respect and preserve the dignity of the profession by refraining from such misapplications of the term,” it said.



The statement drew mixed reactions from Filipinos, with some arguing that there are more pressing issues, such as the reported government corruption involving flood control projects.

“‘Words matter,' daw sabi ng UAP. True. Kaya when they chose to fight for a word, not against corruption, that spoke louder than anything else,” actor-content creator Chuckie Dreyfus wrote in a post.

“For the record: Merriam-Webster defines architect not just as the profession, but also as ‘a person who designs and guides a plan or undertaking,'” he added, citing a dictionary definition of the term “architect.”

“‘We architects build, we don't plunder.' Sana ‘yun na lang ang sinabi. Mas malinaw, mas makabuluhan, mas may paninindigan. Instead, lumabas tuloy na mas priority nila ang semantics kaysa sa accountability,” Chuckie continued.

“My dad was an architect. He'd laugh at this pa-woke fragility and say: corruption is the real insult, not vocabulary,” he concluded, sharing a screengrab of Merriam-Webster's definition of the word “architect.”



Some Filipinos also took to the comments to raise concerns about the UAP's perspective.

“Architect in the statement means orchestrator… Not literally the architect profession…” a Facebook user said.

“This is a little bit of an overreaction. No one in her [or] his right mind will ever interpret it the way you do. I mean, all you have to do is open a dictionary and see that ‘architect' is not just about the profession. Chill. There are bigger problems to solve and more hideous demons to slay,” another said.

“Rhetoric lang namn ‘yan, meaning, nag-isip ng isang bagay para ma-execute ang plano,” a different Pinoy commented.

“Aware ba kayo that you're actually embarrassing yourselves for this statement? May multiple meanings ang word na ‘architect,' both literal and figurative, just like author, engineer, doctor, or pilot. Not an exclusive property of one profession. An architect also means the creator [or] mastermind of a plan, project or system, good or bad,” another said.

“Doctor, a medical professional. Verb is to ‘doctor a document', that's to alter or falsify something,” the user added.

“The list goes on… Pwede naman kasi mag-check ng dictionary, no? Words evolve and carry metaphorical weight, and I don't think any society has authority to dictate or restrict how people use them outside licensing. ‘Yun lang,” the user continued.

Another lexicon, the Cambridge Dictionary, also carries two meanings for the word “architect.”

One is related to the profession, while the other is “a person responsible for achieving a particular plan or aim.”","{'href': 'https://interaksyon.philstar.com', 'title': 'Interaksyon'}","other"

ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. – St. Augustine is one of my favorite north Florida cities and has been for many years. 

My memories of St. Augustine and St. Johns County go back to my childhood. 

My parents favored the off-season for travel, and this often found us in popular spots with very few people. On one of these trips, we got a behind-the-scenes look at the Castillo de San Marcos, which led to us firing a cannon…allegedly. 

I remember when you could turn right at the Fort Matanzas Beach Drive Access and hide under the bridge before EZ-UP tents.

Thanks to my hobbies of running, cycling and riding motorcycles, I have gotten to know the county backroads intimately. 

The St. Augustine Lighthouse has been my beacon for runs and rides, and it's been a place I've wanted to explore ever since I saw that famous episode of TAPS (The Atlantic Paranormal Society), aka Ghost Hunters, around 2006 to 2008, and then again in 2019.

To be a part of a paranormal investigation at the St. Augustine Lighthouse has been a bucket list item since, and with the help of some coworkers, we got to make that happen.

Press play below to join us on a fun night of things that go bump in the night at the St. Augustine Lighthouse and Maritime Museum.

Decades before Mark Sebastian Jordan wrote about the murderous and paranormal history of North Central Ohio, his convictions wrangled with discoveries he made every day.

“I was a skeptic,” the author said. “I very much kind of came at things from a scientific perspective.”

As a youngster, he thought he might grow up to be a paleontologist, volcanologist or some other scientist.

“I saw no provable scientific basis for ghosts, so I didn't really give it much thought,” Jordan said.

Now, 40 years of research later, he has so much evidence of hauntings throughout the region that he published them in a book called ""In These Haunted Hills: Ghosts of the Ohio Highlands.""

Jordan will debut the book 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sept. 27-28 during the Ohio Heritage Days at Malabar Farm State Park near Lucas.

The transition from doubter to devotee happened one day after college when Jordan clocked out for his lunch break.

“I was still living at home with my folks at this time, about halfway between Mansfield and Shelby,” he said. “That particular day, I was really tired because I was involved in a play production.”

He walked into the house and found his mother babysitting his young nephew. Exhausted, he sat down and turned on the television.

“I can hear the sound of Mom fiddling around with some pots and pans in the kitchen,” Jordan said. “Then I hear the sound of the baby toddling out of the kitchen and around the edge of the couch, and I feel a little tingle on the bottom of my chin in my beard like he's reached out his finger to touch me.”

Like a good uncle, he reached back to acknowledge the baby's playful advances.

“That's when I realized the baby's not there and the kitchen is dead quiet,” Jordan said. “Mom wasn't in there moving pots and pans around, and in fact, she had taken the baby and they went to take a nap.”

The experience forced him to reevaluate his worldview.

“That was the first point when I was confronted with the realization, ‘Oh, maybe there are things going on that I can't easily explain or dismiss,' and that was all it took,” Jordan said. “That opened the door – a crack – and ever since then, I've found that I really pick up on things like that.”

Searching for and recognizing new encounters became one of his favorite hobbies.

“It's almost like a radio thing,” Jordan said. “You have to open yourself up to tune into it, and it's very possible to tune it out.”

If the phenomena present themselves through frequencies, the region's lead investigator decided, then his own mind is the antenna. The best way to discover new programs would be to move around until he receives another clear signal.

“I've been all over the state and beyond doing ghost hunting,” Jordan said. “I think that a lot of the hauntings that are encountered by people are scientific phenomena that may yet someday be explained. They're elusive, difficult, tricky to capture.”

His work over 40 years has given him access to many locations abundant with paranormal activity and introduced him to perplexing stories from the region's history, and afforded him the time to research them to completion.

He is known throughout the Buckeye State as an author, playwright, columnist, newspaperman, music critic and folk artist.

Some of Jordan's most popular books include ""The Ceely Rose Murders at Malabar Farm,"" ""The Witch of Mansfield: The Tetched Life of Phebe Wise"" and ""Get Busy Living: Doing Time at Shawshank: Behind the Scenes on the World's Favorite Movie.""

This summer, his publisher called and told him there would be a delay on publishing his eighth book, with his work not hitting stores until 2026.

“I understand, but I wanted to have something new for Heritage Days,” Jordan said. “I've been for the last few years trying to have out a new book every fall.”

The author's jovial smile faded as he recalled hearing the news. He took a sip of coffee with one hand, then lovingly patted his kitten, Lady Jane, with the other.

He decided in August that nothing would stop him from having a new book, so he called a second publisher and asked the absolute fastest they could edit and print his first run. The answer? Two weeks.

“I wrote the book in 13 days,” Jordan said with a glimmer in his eye. “That was 13 days of hammering.”

The new book is his ninth completed, but eighth published.

The book, ""In These Haunted Hills: Ghosts of the Ohio Highlands,"" is a mixture of his own personal experiences, folklore from the region, eyewitness accounts he has collected and history he has researched.

“In a couple cases, I've been able to go and find the roots of stories that everyone just dismissed as folklore,” Jordan said.

The stories are from Richland, Ashland, Holmes, Coshocton, Knox and Crawford counties.

Some of the locations are famous, while others are offbeat.

“I have one chapter that is just specifically about hauntings in private residences throughout the region that I've experienced,” Jordan said.

He devoted a chapter to Brownella Cottage in Galion, a famous paranormally active house and museum.

Another section of the book is about the Ohio State Reformatory, the prison made famous by Stephen King as Shawshank State Penitentiary.

There's also a look at The Renaissance Theatre in downtown Mansfield.

“I had so much Malabar stuff that I divided that into three chapters,” Jordan said. “One is about the Big House, one is about the hostel and one is kind of miscellaneous about everything else, including the big barn.”

And some of the stories will be news to many readers, like the tale of Sarah's grave in a haunted cemetery near Greer that eventually became popular among high school students.

“Guys would take their dates and, hopefully, the dates would get scared and hug them a little closer,” Jordan said. “I dug through the detritus of time and found that there is a true story that whole situation arose from and there actually was a Sarah.”

The author hopes readers will appreciate learning more about the haunted hills of North Central Ohio.

“When I tell these stories, I do not claim to have all the answers,” Jordan said. “Anyone who tells you they do have the answers is trying to sell you something.”

The 1982 blockbuster film E.T. made aliens easy to love. In the film, a crinkled extraterrestrial being with large expressive eyes—looking like the love child of a turtle and an ape—takes shelter in the home of a young boy named Elliott after getting stranded on Earth. For the bulk of the movie, Elliott protects his otherworldly friend from government agents, who treat E.T. as a threat, the same way they might treat a deadly virus or an explosive device. E.T., who clearly displays intelligence and a complex emotional life, has no rights.While the popular film is entirely fictional, and scientists have yet to detect life outside of Earth's atmosphere, the hunt has quickened in recent years. With advanced telescopes, astronomers can now identify and image potentially habitable exoplanets and moons. They send autonomous probes to sample alien atmospheres for signs of biological activity. And with rovers like Perseverance, they seek biosignatures in the Martian soil. These explorations, and growing efforts to commercialize space, lend an urgency to ethical questions about extraterrestrial life. If living things do exist outside of Earth, and we come face-to-face with them, how should we treat them? What kinds of rights should they have? And who decides?

Legal rights should apply not just off-Earth life, but off-Earth ecosystems.

Now a trio of scientists from the United Kingdom—one astrobiologist, one earth scientist, and one legal scholar—have weighed in on these questions. In a recently published Space Policy paper, they suggest that a framework for the rights of extraterrestrial life should take inspiration from the “rights of nature” movement, which promotes a model of legal guardianship as a way to protect forests, rivers, mountains, even individual ocean waves. Instead of requiring a person or group to prove in court that they were harmed by some environmental disturbance, the rights of nature framework allows a designated person or a group to directly represent the forest or river, which have rights of their own. This guardianship model has long applied in cases where parties that can't represent themselves, such as children, need protecting.The legal origins of the rights of nature movement can be traced back to a paper published in 1972 by scholar Christopher Stone, provocatively titled, “Should Trees Have Legal Standing?” But it took a few decades for the idea to gather momentum. Today rights of nature is a global phenomenon, enshrined in local and national governance and even in the constitutions of some countries, such as Ecuador. The United Nations recently hailed it as the fastest growing legal movement of the 21st Century.In their Space Policy paper, the U.K. scholars tally the rights of nature successes and suggest that expanding the “circle of rights beyond Earth” will require environmental conservation groups to join forces with groups that govern activities in space, such as the United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs.

Legal standing for extraterrestrial life could be achieved, they say, by applying existing international environmental law, such as the convention on biological diversity, to space missions and creating a system of guardianship that could represent ETs when missions are planned.Legal rights should not only be afforded to off-Earth life, but off-Earth ecosystems, the authors write. “This definition of ET that we consider for standing is in line with Stone, whose most frequently employed example in ‘Trees' was that of a river, an environment that hosts life while the water is itself not alive.”Of course, if intelligent extraterrestrials exist, they may well be able to speak for themselves, rather than require legal guardians to represent them. So the authors are less worried about Spielbergian E.T. creatures with inner emotional lives than about the hidden microscopic extremophiles that may lurk under the ice on Europa, for example, and the vast liquid ocean that may feed them. Either way, the idea is to set up protections in advance, and to recognize the inherent right of all forms of life in the cosmos to exist.

Inspired by the real-life horrors of a notorious Maryland psychiatric hospital that preyed upon Black communities for decades, Crowsville #1 kicks off a five-part comic series on November 5 from Oni Press.

Written by Rodney Barnes (“The Boondocks,” Killadelphia) and illustrated by Elia Bonetti (Death of Wolverine: The Logan Legacy), we have an exclusive look inside the first issue below.

Founded at the turn of the 20th century outside of Annapolis, Maryland, the Crownsville Hospital was a notoriously segregated, all-Black psychiatric institute. After decades of overcrowding and neglect — alongside darker, more-persistent rumors of patient abuse and illegal medical experiments — it was finally closed.

Today, it stands condemned—a crumbling testament to a legacy of all-too-real terror inflicted on a marginalized and vulnerable community. But even as a ruin of its former self, Crownsville still casts a long shadow…

When an unexplained death inside the abandoned hospital is ruled a suicide, Annapolis police detective Mike Simms and journalist Paul Blairare are compelled to dig deeper, only to discover the reality of the horrors that once took place there… and the powerful connection they share to the anguished spirits of the dead that are still locked within its walls.

The 48-page first issue of Crownsville features covers by Bonetti, Barnes' Killadelphia co-creator Jason Shawn Alexander (Spawn), Syzmon Kudranski (The Punisher), and Andrea Sorrentino (Gideon Falls).

If you're a fan of classic sci-fi shows like The X-Files and The Twilight Zone and are looking for a book that can scratch that itch, Little Visitor & Other Abductions may be just what the doctor ordered. This graphic novel brings together three of cartoonist Adam Szym's alien abduction tales - ""A Cordial Invitation,"" ""Little Visitor,"" and ""Frolicker"" - into one creepy package.

With Little Visitor & Other Abductions in stores now, IGN can exclusively debut a new preview of ""A Cordial Invitation."" Check it out in the slideshow gallery below:

Little Visitor & Other Abductions is written and drawn by Szym. The book is published by Oni Press and distributed by Simon & Schuster. Here's the official description of the book:

The cast and crew of an obscure film recount a tragedy that occurred during its doomed production. A young girl searches for her father in the darkness of the desert and stumbles upon an otherworldly cocktail party. Two strangers nurture violent thoughts in a bitter, lonely child as his village's harvest festival nears. Connecting these three stories is one horrific theme . . .

From cartoonist and illustrator Adam Szym comes a triptych of otherworldly science fiction horror stories about alien abduction and the negligence and malice that allows it to happen. Including the Ignatz Award–nominated A Cordial Invitation, Little Visitor, and a brand-new tale—Frolicker—this uncanny trilogy of graphic novellas is perfect for fans of The Twilight Zone, The X-Files, and all things beyond our understanding.

Little Visitor & Other Abductions is available in bookstores and comic shops now. You can order a copy on Amazon.

Oracle Laura King shared their story and experiences with us recently and you can find our conversation below.

Oracle Laura, a huge thanks to you for investing the time to share your wisdom with those who are seeking it.  We think it's so important for us to share stories with our neighbors, friends and community because knowledge multiples when we share with each other. Let's jump in: What's the most surprising thing you've learned about your customers?My clients want someone who understands what they're going through & can offer them compassion, love, understanding & solutions.

Can you briefly introduce yourself and share what makes you or your brand unique?I'm Oracle Laura, a Psychic Medium, Healer, Life Coach, Spiritual Teacher, Author, Speaker and Private Detective. Every psychic I've met has told me that I'm more psychic than they are and that I have more psychic abilities and superpowers than any other psychic. They say I'm “the best” in my field. I was born into a family of psychics but they soon realized that I was more gifted by God than they were. I'm the only family member who has followed this path and developed my abilities. My powers continue to increase and I hope to help and save as many people I can. I will continue to write more books and expand my business ventures. I've had offers from over 30 different TV and film producers and I've been on many news programs, radio shows, podcasts and one TV show so far. Although people in Hollywood say everyone is talking about me, my goal is not fame and fortune but to save lives.

Okay, so here's a deep one: Who saw you clearly before you could see yourself?When I was age 2 my psychic father (whose mother was known for her psychic abilities) explained to me why my visions and predictions came true. He explained that I'm psychic like him & his mother. When I was age 4 both my father and my mother separately took me to spiritual readers who predicted I will be a leader and spiritual teacher.

What did suffering teach you that success never could?I learned to not suffer and sacrifice myself to save others. It's all too common for people to be insecure and jealous of those who are gifted, beautiful, successful and powerful. I avoid those who disrespect and abuse me. I've learned that I can only help the willing. I make it a top priority to maintain my health and happiness and my faith in God, Justice and Karma.

So a lot of these questions go deep, but if you are open to it, we've got a few more questions that we'd love to get your take on. What's a belief or project you're committed to, no matter how long it takes?Integrity and Truth. I will never lie, no matter how much a person wants me to. I am a Truth Seer and Truth Speaker. My destiny will take care of where I am meant to be.

Okay, so before we go, let's tackle one more area. What do you understand deeply that most people don't?All my predictions come true, regardless of when and even if people don't believe in them. I have faith in my predictions and have witnessed 1000's of them coming true. Only those who heed my warnings and advice will benefit from them.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","Trump's Escalator Incident At UN Sparks Conspiracy Theories","https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trumps-escalator-incident-at-un-sparks-conspiracy-theories-9336878","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 14:04:58 GMT","

An escalator at the United Nations headquarters in New York, which abruptly stalled on Tuesday morning just as President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump stepped onto it, has become the subject of conspiracy theories, despite a straightforward technical account from UN officials.

The incident, brief though it was, overshadowed parts of President Trump's second-term debut speech to the UN General Assembly, and provided fresh material for both his critics and supporters online.

At approximately 9:50 am, President Trump and the US First Lady entered the UN through the delegates' entrance, passing through security before approaching the main escalator that leads up to the second floor. A White House videographer, walking backwards ahead of them to record their arrival, reached the top just as the couple stepped on. At that moment, the escalator jolted to a sudden stop.

The abrupt halt left the president and first lady momentarily stationary before Mrs Trump began climbing the stalled steps herself. President Trump followed closely behind, appearing at times uncertain whether the machine would restart.



In live broadcasts and clips rapidly shared on social media, the spectacle of the US president trudging up a frozen escalator became an instant talking point.

Later that morning, addressing world leaders in the cavernous General Assembly hall, President Trump referred to the escalator incident multiple times.

""All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that, on the way up, stopped right in the middle,"" he said, drawing a ripple of laughter from delegates. He went on to add: ""If the First Lady wasn't in great shape, she would have fallen. But she's in great shape. We both stood.""

The president also faced a second technical hitch during his speech, when the teleprompter briefly failed. He quipped that the operator was ""in big trouble"" and joked that the setbacks meant he was ""speaking more from the heart.""

At a bilateral meeting later in the day with Secretary-General António Guterres, Mr Trump returned to the theme once more. ""This was a little more exciting because of the escalator and the teleprompter. These things happen,"" he said.

Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for the Secretary-General, moved swiftly to provide a technical explanation.

""Our technician, who was present at the location, reset the escalator as soon as the delegation had climbed up to the second floor,"" he told reporters. An investigation of the central processing unit, he said, confirmed that a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step had been triggered.

""The safety mechanism is designed to prevent people or objects from accidentally being caught and stuck in or pulled into the gearing,"" Mr Dujarric explained. ""The videographer may have inadvertently triggered the safety function described above.""

In other words, the fault lay not with UN staff or the machinery, but with the unusual presence of a cameraman walking backwards at the top of the escalator.

Despite this account, speculation flourished online almost immediately. On X (formerly Twitter), short clips of the incident circulated with captions suggesting sabotage. Some posts accused UN staff of deliberately disabling the escalator to embarrass the president.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt gave fuel to such claims, writing: ""If someone at the UN intentionally stopped the escalator as the President and First Lady were stepping on, they need to be fired and investigated immediately."" She also highlighted a past satirical article noting UN staff jokes about shutting off escalators due to budget cuts.

On Fox News, host Jesse Watters alleged more theories: ""They sabotaged him, and they could've hurt the First Lady.""

""All kidding aside did everyone notice how despite the lack of a teleprompter, he delivered a clear, reasonable address on US foreign policy? It's nice to have a president with a brain!"" wrote US Vice President JD Vance on X.

Escalator stoppages at the UN are not uncommon, staff say, particularly in recent years as the organisation has grappled with financial pressures.

Budget shortfalls-caused in part by delayed payments from member states, including the United States, have forced the UN Secretariat to impose periodic cost-saving measures. Elevators and escalators in both New York and Geneva have occasionally been turned off to conserve electricity.

The financial squeeze has even been described internally as a ""liquidity crisis,"" which, while bureaucratic in tone, has had visible effects on the daily functioning of the institution.

By repeatedly referencing both the escalator and the teleprompter failure, the US President appeared to frame his visit as a metaphor for an institution prone to breakdowns. ""These are the two things I got from the United Nations - a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter,"" he told delegates with a shrug.

The passing of Robert Redford has brought renewed attention to a decades-old mystery: the unsolved murder of his daughter's boyfriend—and the fugitive suspect who vanished without a trace. In 1983, Redford's daughter, Shauna, was dating Sid Wells, a University of Colorado Boulder student who was shot and killed in his apartment. Redford, who was preparing to film The Natural at the time, put his career on hold to support his daughter and attend Wells' funeral, per the Guardian. Initial suspicion fell on Wells' roommate, Thayne Alan Smika, but prosecutors declined to charge him, citing a lack of evidence. Smika subsequently disappeared in 1986.

In this article

Microsoft is the lead investor in OpenAI and has long been the artificial intelligence startup's key cloud partner. But in the latest sign that AI relationships are getting complicated, Microsoft is beginning to use more technology from OpenAI rival Anthropic.

The software giant said Wednesday that it's starting to draw on an AI model from Anthropic to answer some queries in the Microsoft 365 Copilot assistant for commercial clients.

The effort represents another step toward diversification in generative AI for Microsoft, which has mainly relied on OpenAI models for artificial intelligence features in Bing, Windows and other products. As part of a strategic partnership, Microsoft has invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI, and OpenAI operates its models in the Azure cloud, among other places.

OpenAI has been busy expanding its roster of high-powered partners. In recent weeks, the company has disclosed that it plans to spend $300 billion with Oracle, and it's forged a $10 billion agreement with chip designer Broadcom. This week, chipmaker Nvidia said it will invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a joint effort to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on new data centers.

Microsoft and OpenAI remain close, but their arrangement is changing.

Last year, Microsoft said it was allowing software engineers to get coding help from Anthropic and Google models in the GitHub Copilot Chat assistant, and not just from OpenAI. Anthropic, founded in 2021 by former OpenAI executives, was recently valued by investors at $183 billion. Microsoft remains the exclusive cloud supplier for OpenAI's programming interface that third-party applications rely on.

Anthropic's model is coming first to Researcher, an agent for Microsoft 365 Copilot that can gather and analyze information and generate reports.

Employees at organizations enrolled in Microsoft's Frontier program, which provides early access to AI features, can now choose to use Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.1 reasoning model, a type of model that's designed to break down complex tasks, as an alternative to OpenAI's competitive offering in Researcher.

""And stay tuned: Anthropic models will bring even more powerful experiences to Microsoft 365 Copilot,"" Charles Lamanna, Microsoft's president of business and industry Copilot, wrote in a blog post.

Corporate users can now opt to tap Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Opus 4.1 when building their own AI agents with Microsoft's Copilot Studio tool.

Administrators must enable Anthropic models before employees can use them. The models run in the Amazon and Google clouds. Their use is subject to Anthropic's terms and conditions, Lamanna wrote.

In addition to incorporating large language models from more companies, Microsoft has started testing MAI-1-preview, which it built in-house.

""As AI becomes more capable and agentic, models themselves become more of a commodity,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in an October LinkedIn post.

Last year, Microsoft identified OpenAI and Anthropic as competitors in AI products.

The Information reported on Microsoft's Copilot plans with Anthropic earlier in September.

Copilot is key to Microsoft's AI strategy.

""It continues to be rolled out among enterprises in phases,"" analysts at KeyBanc wrote in a July note to clients. The analysts, who recommend holding the stock, wrote that based on an ""industry check,"" about 60% of customers are ""implementing Copilot for just 10% of their 365 user base,"" and just 4% roll it out for every user.

At least 14 people have been confirmed dead after floodwaters from the Mataian River (馬太鞍溪) barrier lake burst into Hualien County's Guangfu Township (光復) on Tuesday, government officials said yesterday, after Super Typhoon Ragasa pounded Taiwan with torrential rain.

The lake in eastern Hualien — formed by a series of landslides that created a natural dam wall — burst, washing away a bridge and sweeping into Guangfu with a trail of thick sludge and mud.

“It was like a volcano erupting... The muddy floodwaters came roaring straight into the first floor of my house,” said Hsu Cheng-hsiung, 55, a neighborhood leader of Guangfu.

More than half of Guangfu's 8,450 people sought safety on higher floors of their homes or on higher ground yesterday morning. The streets were caked in thick gray mud after the flood hit, with fallen trees blocking the way.

Wrecked cars and scooters lay by the roadside or piled on top of each other by the flood waters, and some metal gates and roofs of homes were destroyed, with furniture scattered along the streets.

Residents said the mud was too much to clear by themselves with more help for the cleanup expected today.

“I was very scared... About 500m in front of me, the stream suddenly swelled into a flood,” a 54-year-old relief volunteer surnamed Shih (施) said at a makeshift shelter. “I heard police broadcasting on the street: ‘The water is coming, run.'”

Residents were ordered to evacuate amid fears that the barrier lake would overflow again or burst, a day after the initial breach.

Local broadcasts at about 11:30am instructed residents to halt cleanup work and head toward Rueisuei Township (瑞穗) for safety.

Authorities said the confirmation of a new overflow was pending, but that precautionary measures were necessary due to heavy rains.

As of 5pm yesterday, there were a total of 17 deaths and 32 injured across the country, the Central Emergency Operation Center said.

The death toll at 10:30pm was again fixed and dropped to 14, while the number of missing also fell from 152 to 46, as rescuers established contact with more than 100 people who were previously unreachable, and were going door-to-door to check on the remaining 46 residents, the National Fire Agency said.

“Seventeen people remain missing after the Mataian River barrier lake burst. We must ... seize the time for rescue,” Minister of the Interior Liu Shyh-fang (劉世芳) told a government briefing.

Premier Cho Jung-tai (卓榮泰) visited the area yesterday, pledging to provide assistance to those affected.

He said the authorities should find out why “evacuation orders were not carried out in the affected area,” which led to the casualties, and ordered representatives of central government agencies to stay in Hualien to support relief efforts.

Across Taiwan, nearly 8,400 people were evacuated due to Super Typhoon Ragasa.

In areas around the barrier lake, 3,285 people were evacuated and about 1,200 were staying in shelters, the fire agency said.

The Central Weather Administration said rainfall in Guangfu had eased, but warned that eastern and southeastern Taiwan could still see heavy showers or localized downpours.

Saturated mountain soil remained prone to landslides, rockfalls and debris flows, it said.


WARNING:
                                        People in coastal areas need to beware of heavy swells and strong winds, and those in mountainous areas should brace for heavy rain, the CWA said                                        The Central Weather Administration (CWA) yesterday issued sea and land warnings for Typhoon Ragasa, forecasting that it would continue to intensify and affect the nation the most today and tomorrow. 
People in Hualien and Taitung counties, and mountainous areas in Yilan and Pingtung counties, should brace for damage caused by extremely heavy rain brought by the typhoon's outer rim, as it was upgraded to a super typhoon yesterday morning, the CWA said. 
As of 5:30pm yesterday, the storm's center was about 630km southeast of Oluanpi (鵝鑾鼻), Taiwan's southernmost tip, moving northwest at 21kph, and its maximum wind speed had reached                                    


MATAIAN RIVER:
                                        Rescue operations were ongoing, with officials urging residents to move to higher floors where possible as teams focus first on those at ground level                                        Floodwaters from the overflowing Mataian River (馬太鞍溪) barrier lake swept into Hualien County's Guangfu Township (光復) yesterday afternoon, leaving hundreds of people trapped and three missing as of press time last night, the Hualien County Fire Bureau said.
The waters surged into downtown Guangfu after the riverbank burst at about 2:50pm, carrying mud and debris and submerging streets to rooftop level in some areas.
Residents were seen climbing onto vehicles and rooftops to await rescue as thick, silt-laden water inundated the town.
The surge destroyed the Mataian Bridge (馬太鞍溪橋) and flooded the Guangfu Railway Station.
Rescue operations were launched with support from fire departments                                    



                                                                                The Central Weather Administration (CWA) yesterday said that it expected to issue a sea warning for Typhoon Ragasa this morning and a land warning at night as it approached Taiwan.
Ragasa intensified from a tropical storm into a typhoon at 8am yesterday, the CWA said, adding that at 2pm, it was about 1,110km east-southeast of Oluanpi (鵝鑾鼻), Taiwan's southernmost tip.
The typhoon was moving northwest at 13kph, with sustained winds of up to 119kph and gusts reaching 155kph, the CWA Web site showed.
Forecaster Liu Pei-teng (劉沛滕) said that Ragasa was projected to strengthen as it neared the Bashi Channel, with its 200km                                    


PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS:
                                        Hualien and Taitung counties declared today a typhoon day, while schools and offices in parts of Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties are also to close                                        Typhoon Ragasa was forecast to hit its peak strength and come closest to Taiwan from yesterday afternoon through today, the Central Weather Administration (CWA) said.
Taiwan proper could be out of the typhoon's radius by midday and the sea warning might be lifted tonight, it added.
CWA senior weather specialist Wu Wan-hua (伍婉華) said that Ragasa's radius had reached the Hengchun Peninsula by 11am yesterday and was expected to hit Taitung County and Kaohsiung by yesterday evening.
Ragasa was forecast to move to Taiwan's southern offshore areas last night and to its southwestern offshore areas early today, she added.
As of 8pm last night,                                    ","{'href': 'https://www.taipeitimes.com', 'title': 'Taipei Times'}","world"

            Italy said it deployed one of its naval vessels on Wednesday to come to the aid of an aid flotilla that was targeted by drones while trying to reach Gaza, with activists claiming that Israel was behind the strikes.
    


            Volunteers from the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) – an organization trying to get aid into the besieged enclave using ships setting sail from ports across the Mediterranean – say that some of their vessels were targeted by drones. The organization claimed the attacks are part of a sustained Israeli campaign of intimidation.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.
    


            The boats were just days from reaching the enclave when the latest reported attacks occurred on Tuesday. 



            “In the final days before reaching Gaza, the GSF is experiencing an alarmingly dangerous escalation, with multiple boats reporting targeted explosions and unidentified objects being dropped on and near the boats, causing significant damage and widespread obstruction in communication,” the organization said in a statement Tuesday.
    


            The incident has raised urgent concerns for the safety of the more than 500 unarmed participants aboard the flotillas, the GSF said.
    


            There are variety of nationals on board the vessels, including citizens from Italy, Sweden and Spain, CNN understands.
    


            Speaking from one of the vessels following the reported attack, a Spanish lawmaker urged international action to help the activists.
    


            “I think this has to escalate further and further and reach … European Commission levels, because this needs to be tackled, coordinated with all the countries, at least in Europe,” lawmaker Juan Bordera told Reuters.
    


            Bordera added that those on the flotilla were “stressed” and lived through a “crazy, crazy nightmare” amid Tuesday night's explosions.
    


            On Tuesday, Israel's foreign ministry said on X that the country would take “necessary measures” to stop the flotilla from reaching Gaza. The ministry said it would be willing to transfer the aid from the flotilla to Gaza through the Ashkelon port in Israel, but it accused flotilla organizers of refusing such a transfer and “pursuing a violent course of action.”
    


            “If the flotilla continues to reject Israel's peaceful proposal, Israel will take the necessary measures to prevent its entry into the combat zone and to stop any violation of a lawful naval blockade, while making every possible effort to ensure the safety of its passengers,” the ministry added.
    


            Francesca Albanese, United Nations special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, wrote on X that the flotilla had come under attack 14 times between Tunis and Crete. “Four vessels are now damaged and require urgent repair. As of last night, an unexploded device remains on one of the boats,” she wrote.
    


            UN Human Rights Office spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan has called for an “independent, impartial and thorough investigation” into the reported attacks.
    


            Italy has authorized the dispatch of an Italian naval vessel, which according to a statement from Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto, is now en route to the area for possible rescue operations. The statement added that the drone attack was carried out by “currently unidentified perpetrators.”
    


            Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni spoke of her “total condemnation” of the drone strike on Tuesday night, calling it “gratuitous, dangerous and irresponsible.” Meloni added that Italy is “conducting our own investigation to determine who is responsible.”
    


            Italian officials say the Gaza-bound vessels are carrying Italian citizens, along with parliamentarians. “To ensure their safety, the foreign ministry had already notified the Israeli authorities that any operation entrusted to Israel's armed forces be conducted in compliance with international law and the principle of absolute caution,” a statement from Italy's foreign ministry said.
    


            Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani is working to mediate with the Israeli government to allow the humanitarian supplies transported by the flotilla to enter Gaza, a spokesperson for his office told CNN.
    


            “The minister is in contact with the Israeli government and has identified a credible mediation mechanism. The Italian government is examining all options to avoid further offensive actions against the flotilla's vessels,” the office added.
    


            Meanwhile, Sweden's foreign ministry said it is following the developments very closely, adding that approximately 15 Swedish nationals were aboard the vessels.
    


            In May, activists on board an aid ship say they were targeted by an Israeli drone in international waters off the coast of Malta. The IDF did not deny involvement in the drone attack. An Israeli Air Force cargo plane was picked up on flight trackers circling the waters near Malta for an extended period of time before the attack.

            The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has fired back at Donald Trump's false claims that Sharia law is being introduced in the British capital, calling the US president “racist,” “sexist,” “misogynistic” and “Islamophobic.”
    


            Trump used his speech at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York on Tuesday to label Khan a “terrible mayor” and falsely claim London wants “to go to Sharia law.”
    


            Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a Western capital city, told reporters Wednesday: “People are wondering what it is about this Muslim mayor who leads a liberal, multi-cultural, progressive and successful city that means I appear to be living rent-free inside Donald Trump's head.”
    


            He added, “I think, as Donald Trump has shown, he is racist, he is sexist, he is misogynistic and he is Islamophobic.”
    


            CNN has contacted the White House for comment.
    


            London City Hall had earlier responded to Trump's remarks, saying in a statement: “London is the greatest city in the world, safer than major US cities, and we're delighted to welcome the record number of US citizens moving here.”
    


            Sharia law is based on Islam's holy book, the Quran, and the life of prophet Mohammed. It refers to a set of principles that govern the moral and religious lives of Muslims on matters as varied as prayer, finance, divorce or halal food.
    


            According to a UK government document published in 2019, Sharia councils have existed in the country since the 1980s but are used to “solve the matrimonial problems of Muslims living in the United Kingdom in the light of Islamic family law.”
    


            Their rulings are not legally binding as the councils “have no official legal or constitutional role in the UK,” according to the government.
    


            UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting defended Khan in a post on X Tuesday, writing: “Sadiq Khan is not trying to impose Sharia Law on London.”
    


            “This is a Mayor who marches with Pride, who stands up for difference of background and opinion, who's focused on improving our transport, our air, our streets, our safety, our choices and chances. Proud he's our Mayor,” Streeting said.
    


            Trump was in the United Kingdom last week for an unprecedented second state visit. Second-term US presidents aren't typically afforded the pomp of two official trips. A state banquet was held in his honor at Windsor Castle, but his itinerary didn't include a journey to the British capital – where crowds of protesters had gathered.
    


            Khan, who was elected in 2016, is a strong critic of Trump, notably giving permission for protesters to fly a 20-foot-tall “Trump baby” balloon in London during his first presidential visit to the United Kingdom in 2016.
    


            There have been several verbal clashes between the two men in the last decade.
    


            On the campaign trail before his first term as president, Trump pledged to ban Muslims from the US once in office. Khan at the time deemed it an “outrageous policy.”
    


            Khan later called Trump's views on Islam “ignorant,” to which the president hit back, saying, “I will remember those statements. They are very nasty statements.”
    


Protests, projections and programs: How Britons are showing their displeasure at Trump's visit



            In a 2019 opinion piece in British publication The Guardian, the London mayor condemned what he called the red-carpet roll-out that welcomed Trump and his wife Melania on their first UK state visit.
    


            “Donald Trump is just one of the most egregious examples of a growing global threat,” Khan wrote. The mayor further criticized the president in another op-ed earlier this month, accusing the Trump administration's policies of being “straight out of the autocrat's playbook.”
    


            During a joint conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in July, Trump reignited the feud, calling Khan a “nasty person” who was doing a “terrible job.”
    


            Starmer interrupted Trump, saying of Khan, “He's a friend of mine, actually.”

Joshua Jahn killed two detainees and severely injured another before taking his own life, NBC News reports, as DHS says another detainee in critical condition

Full report – Three people shot at Texas Ice building

The shooter who killed two detainees, and severely injured another, before taking his own life, has been identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, according to NBC News – who cited several senior law enforcement officials.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) noted, in their statement on today's shooting, that this isn't the first time the Dallas field office was targeted this year.

In August, Bratton Dean Wilkinson, 36, arrived at facility's entrance and claimed to have a bomb in his backpack. Officials said that Wilkinson showed the security officer what he claimed to be a “detonator” on his wrist. 

A shelter-in-place was issued for the field office, and Dallas police responded with a bomb squad. Wilkinson was later charged with making terroristic threats, per DHS.

The state superintendent in Oklahoma announced plans to put Turning Point USA chapters in every high school in the state, saying it would counter “radical leftist teachers' unions” and their “woke indoctrination”.

After far-right activist Charlie Kirk was killed on a college campus earlier this month, requests to start chapters of his conservative youth group, Turning Point, at colleges and high schools have surged, the organization has said.

Oklahoma is the first state where the government is getting involved to promote starting these chapters. In a press release Tuesday, Ryan Walters, the Oklahoma superintendent, detailed how students could start a chapter of “Club America”, the organization's high school program, by gathering at least three students from the same school and completing a charter agreement. Then, Turning Point will help the club get a teacher sponsor and official recognition, and send materials like an “activism kit”.

“We will be putting TPUSA on every high school campus in Oklahoma,” Walter said in the press release. “Charlie Kirk inspired a generation to love America, to speak boldly, and to never shy away from debate. Our kids must get involved and active. We will fight back against the liberal propaganda, pushed by the radical left, and the teachers unions. Our fight starts now.”

Two detainees have been killed, with another in critical condition, after a shooting at an Ice field office near downtown Dallas. Dallas police chief Daniel Comeaux says that the FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence. The shooter died from a “self-inflicted gun wound”, according to DHS secretary Kristi Noem.

DHS say that no members of law enforcement were hurt in the attack. But Comeaux also said that officials would not releasing the identities of any victims at this time.

DHS officials say this was “an attack on ICE law enforcement”. At both today's press conference and in a statement, law enforcement said that shell casings found near the shooter had “anti-Ice” messaging on them.

Earlier, Dallas police said that shots were fired “from an adjacent building”. DHS, later added that the shooter “fired indiscriminately” at the Ice facility, “including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot”.

Despite the fact that no federal agents were wounded in the shooting, Governor Greg Abbott of Texas called the attack an “assassination”. For her part, Noem said that “these horrendous killings must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences.”

The 12-ft bronze statue depicting Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein holding hands and prancing together that was erected on the National Mall early on Tuesday has been taken down.

The statue appeared courtesy of a group of anonymous artists that goes by The Secret Handshake, who said they received a permit from the National Park Service that allowed the statue to stay up until 8pm on 28 September.

A member of the group told the Guardian that despite this, it was removed in the early hours of Wednesday. They do not know the statue's whereabouts. “This is a literal example of the Trump administration toppling free speech when it has been legally permitted and approved,” they said.

A spokesperson for United States Park Police told the Washingtonian that the force assisted the National Park Service in removing the statue Wednesday at 5:30am, “due to it not being in compliance with the permit”.

Despite receiving some serious flack recently for his premature social media updates on the Charlie Kirk shooting investigation which turned out to be wrong, FBI director Kash Patel has been quick to post on X the few details we've just heard from that *brief* press conference.

Patel simply confirms that one person was killed in the attack [two if we include the shooter], several wounded, the shooter took his own life, and no law enforcement personnel were hurt. He posted a photo of five shell casings, one of which is engraved with the phrase “anti Ice” in blue ink, which he said belonged to the gunman and “shows an idealogical [sic] motive behind this attack”.

Patel did not mention in his post that among the victims were Ice detainees, neither did officials at that press conference.

A reminder that the investigation is ongoing and a motivation for the shooting hasn't yet been established.

Texas senator Ted Cruz says “politically motivated violence is wrong” and needs to stop, referring to the killing of Charlie Kirk.

Comeaux confirms that no members of law enforcement were hurt in the attack. Four people were shot and two people are dead.

Notably, Comeaux says they're not releasing the identities of any victims at this time.

DHS earlier confirmed that detainees were “among the victims”.

Comeaux says that early evidence suggests rounds found near the shooter contained messages that were “anti-Ice in nature”.

Dallas police chief Daniel Comeaux says that the FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence.

Dallas mayor Eric Johnson is speaking now.

He asks for prayers for the city and the country.

Texas governor Greg Abbott has posted the following on X:

Texas fully supports ICE. Both the Texas Dept. of Public Safety & Texas National Guard work closely with ICE. This assassination will NOT slow our arrest, detention, & deportation of illegal immigrants. We will work with ICE & the Dallas Police Dept. to get to the bottom of the assassin's motive. We will offer ICE additional support to assist their operations.

Abbott, and vice-president JD Vance, have been quick to frame the shooting as an attack on Ice, even though the DHS has already confirmed that no federal agents were wounded and the only confirmed victims have been detainees.

We'll learn more of the facts in the press conference due to begin shortly.

Law enforcement officials will brief the media shortly following the shooting at an Ice field office in Dallas.

At least one person was pronounced dead at the scene, and two are wounded. A DHS official said that detainees were among the victims and that no federal agents were wounded.

Dan Bongino, deputy director of the FBI, said that his office is “fully engaged” with local law enforcement in Dallas following today's shooting.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theglobeandmail.com","Insiders taking profits in Cameco, but others are snapping up shares in smaller uranium stocks","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-uranium-stocks-cameco-nuclear-power-supply-chain-trump/","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 08:30:00 GMT","

Cameco shares have more than doubled in the last year.Liam Richards/The Canadian Press

When Prime Minister Mark Carney met with Donald Trump in the White House in early May, the U.S. President rambled off a list of products, including cars and steel, that he said the United States did not need from Canada. Uranium was not on that list. 

There is a good reason for the Trump administration to keep the door open to Canadian uranium. America's nuclear power supply chain is currently vulnerable, with about 25 per cent of the country's enriched uranium being sourced from Russia. That reality likely prompted U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright to champion the expansion of America's uranium stockpiles as he was attending the International Atomic Energy Agency general conference in Vienna on Sept. 15 The news sparked renewed interest in uranium stocks which have already been in a bull market.

Cameco CCO-T shares have more than doubled over the past 12 months, and insiders at the uranium mining giant have been in profit-taking mode. As of Sept. 19, 14 Cameco insiders have sold just over $12.7-million worth of stock into the public market over the past six months. The 130,787 shares were sold at an average price of $97.34. During the same period, four insiders acquired a total of 91,325 shares through the exercise of options at strike prices ranging from $11.32 to $15.27.

Such insider profit-taking is not unusual given the stock's rally, particularly given its pricey valuations. Last week, the stock had a trailing 12-month P/E ratio above 90. Weighed down by insider sales and high valuations, Cameco sits in the bottom 30 per cent of our INK Edge rankings based on valuations, insider buying and holdings, and price momentum. That said, Cameco does rank high in terms of price momentum, and it is conceivable that the stock could continue to rise despite insider profit-taking and its price tag. In our experience, insider selling in large companies can often take place months and even years before a stock enters a meaningful correction.

Uranium miner Cameco lowers 2025 production forecast amid McArthur River mine transition delays

In terms of actionable signals, we generally tend to favour insider buying over selling. On that front, two smaller names have hit our screens recently. Mega Uranium MGA-T is an investment and junior exploration company which is currently in the top 10 per cent of our rankings with a sunny INK Edge outlook. It caught our attention as a potential value play. Over the past six months, five insiders acquired just over 1.6 million shares, primarily through options. As of June 30, Mega Uranium's investment portfolio had a fair value of $202-million while the stock's current market cap is about $145-million. 

As of midyear, the investment portfolio included 19,476,265 NexGen Energy NXE-T shares and 1,033,736 IsoEnergy ISO-T shares. As of Friday, NexGen shares are up year-to-date by 28 per cent and IsoEnergy is up 25.2 per cent, but Mega Uranium has risen only 16.6 per cent. If bullish uranium sentiment picks up more steam in the months ahead, junior names like Mega Uranium, which have lagged some larger names, could conceivably benefit from increased investor flows. Under such a scenario, the stock's discount to net asset value could shrink as the stock plays catch-up. 

The Canadian market is also in the fortuitous position of having exposure to mining names with operations in different parts of the world, including the United States. Anfield Energy AEC-X is focused on its Shootaring Canyon Mill and the Velvet-Wood and Slick Rock uranium and vanadium projects. Shootaring Canyon is one of three licensed, permitted, and constructed conventional uranium mills in the U.S. The mill and Velvet-Wood are in Utah while Slick Rock is nearby in Colorado. On May 13, Velvet-Wood became the first uranium project fast-tracked under Mr. Trump's energy emergency declaration.

On May 27, the U.S. Department of the Interior completed its environmental permitting for the project. We often hear Mr, Carney talk about Canada building projects at speeds never imagined. The speed up of the Anfield approval shows the type of competition Canada is facing.

Despite the headlines, Anfield stock has failed to surpass its 52-week high of $10.13 set last October. Chief operating officer Daniel Bleak appears to see opportunity. On July 31, the company consolidated its shares on a 75 to 1 basis as it pursued a U.S. listing. Over the past three months, he has bought 7,750 at an average price of $7.95 on a post-consolidation basis. He now holds 267,006 shares representing about 1.7 per cent of all shares outstanding.

Kremlin says 'no alternative' to continuing war against Ukraine

Below you can read a round-up of the headlines on Russia's war in Ukraine from Wednesday, September 24.

Germany said that US President Donald Trump's remarks about supporting Ukraine in retaking land occupied by Russia had fuelled hopes of further increasing pressure on Moscow.

At a regular government press conference, spokesperson Stefan Kornelius said that Trump's statements align with the German government's political goals ""to keep up the pressure on the aggressor Russia and to increasingly isolate Russia."" 

""These statements give us reason to hope that we can now discuss this issue more intensively and maintain the necessary pressure on Russia,"" he added.

The European Commission will propose higher import tariffs on Russian oil in ""due course,"" according to a Commission spokesperson who was quoted by Reuters news agency.

Hungary and Slovakia, both EU member states, import around 200,000–250,000 barrels of Russian oil per day. This accounts for approximately 3% of the EU's total oil demand.

Last week, US President Donald Trump published a letter accusing NATO member states of weakening the alliance's negotiating position and bargaining power regarding Russia's war in Ukraine by continuing to purchase Russian oil and gas.

Trump vowed that the US would impose ""major sanctions"" on Russia once all NATO countries had ceased such purchases. 

For years, the European Commission has been trying to persuade the governments of Hungary and Slovakia to diversify their energy sources beyond those from Russia.

Progress has been slow due to these governments' insistence on keeping costs low and their reliance on existing infrastructure.

Early on Wednesday, a Spanish military jet carrying Defense Minister Margarita Robles experienced a GPS disturbance as it flew near Russia's Kaliningrad exclave en route to Lithuania, according to the ministry.

""There has been an attempt to disrupt the GPS signal, but as our aircraft has an encrypted system, it was not affected,"" a ministry spokesperson said.

""It must be common on this route and also with commercial flights. It is not because it is our aircraft,"" they added.

In addition to Robles, the plane was carrying relatives of Spanish airmen who are part of the NATO air defense mission on its eastern flank. The mission was launched earlier this month after Poland shot down drones that violated its airspace.

According to the Spanish government's agenda, Robles was scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting with her Lithuanian counterpart, Dovile Sakaliene, during her visit to the Siauliai Air Base on Wednesday.

Earlier, Estonia and neighboring Finland had also accused Russia of jamming GPS navigation devices in the region's airspace. Russia has denied interfering with communication and satellite networks.

This incident follows a similar one in which the GPS system of a plane carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was jammed en route to Bulgaria on August 31.

The Kremlin said it was wrong to think Ukraine could recapture land occupied by the Russian army.

The statement came a day after US President Donald Trump said that Kyiv could push Russian forces completely out of the country.

""The idea that Ukraine can recapture something is, from our point of view, mistaken,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

On Tuesday, Trump also said that Russia's economy was in trouble and that Moscow's forces had been ""fighting aimlessly for three and a half years.""

However, Peskov said the war was not aimless and claimed that it arose from the United States' and the European Union's unwillingness to address Russia's security concerns.

Russia's Finance Ministry has proposed raising the value-added tax rate to 22% from 20% in 2026 to fund increased military spending for the ongoing war in Ukraine.

According to the ministry, the 10% VAT rate on food, medicine, and children's goods would remain unchanged. 

According to government estimates, military and security spending already accounts for about 40% of total government expenditure in the 2025 budget. 

Large state orders for the defense industry and substantial payments to soldiers and their families have fueled growth in Russia's war economy. However, signs of strain are emerging in civilian sectors, and inflation is squeezing household budgets.

The budget proposal still requires parliamentary approval, a step widely seen as a formality in Russia.

The Kremlin rejected the idea that Russia was a ""paper tiger,"" as said by US President Trump, and said it had no choice but to continue its war in Ukraine.

""We are continuing our special military operation to ensure our interests and achieve the goals,"" set by Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday, using Moscow's term for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

""We are doing this for both the present and the future of our country. For many generations to come. Therefore, we have no alternative,"" he added in a radio interview.

Peskov also pushed back against Trump's ""paper tiger"" remark.

""Russia is by no means a tiger. Russia is traditionally seen as a bear. There is no such thing as paper bears. Russia is a real bear ... There is nothing paper about it,"" Peskov said.

He did, however, concede that the economy, which has been slowing after three years of rapid growth and stubborn inflation, is facing headwinds.

""Russia maintains its macroeconomic stability,"" Peskov said, adding that it ""is experiencing tensions and problems in various sectors of the economy.""

He also said that the rapprochement that began when Trump returned to the White House in January has yielded ""close to zero"" results.

These comments were made in response to US President Donald Trump's statement that Ukraine could reclaim all its territory from Russia and his characterization of Russia as a ""paper tiger"" with a failing economy.

European countries need to step up their support for Ukraine, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said, following remarks by US President Donald Trump that Ukraine could retake all of its land occupied by Russia.

""We can achieve much more; not all European states have done what they promised Ukraine for a long time. We need to look at what other financial and military options we have,"" Wadephul told German public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk.

The German minister emphasized that the US president is right to demand a greater financial commitment from Europeans and an end to their reliance on Russian energy.

Olha Stefanishyna, who was appointed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as Ukraine's ambassador to the US at the end of August, told DW that the meeting between Zelenskyy and US President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly was ""the longest and most thorough"" meeting the two leaders had had.



According to Stafnishyna, the meeting has a very wide agenda, including briefings on the military and economic situations, as well as the management of frozen Russian assets and a discussion about a mineral deal.

When asked about the unexpected change of Trump's position, who stated that Ukraine could regain its territory from Russia, she answered that there has been a major shift because both sides have come a long way.

""President Trump had a meeting and phone calls with President Putin, who made a lot of promises and spread incorrect information. Steve Witkoff went to Moscow many times. It was a lot of different contexts,"" Stafnishyna said.

The ambassador emphasized that Tuesday's meeting between the US and Ukrainian leaders was about trust.

""I have a sense that President Trump trusts President Zelenskyy,"" she said. ""And it probably won't be possible if all this hadn't been happening before this meeting.""

The dialogue about the security guarantees for Ukraine is ""going really well,"" according to Stefanishyna. ""My president says that [the] contribution of the United States to these security guarantees is really vital and important,"" she said.

According to the envoy, in order to end the war and prevent another attack, it's crucial to have something that would deter the aggressor ""from even thinking of a new aggression.""

Stefanishyna said that the United States will determine its contribution to security guarantees once European leaders have decided on their role.

""Now that the US is getting on board, it helps the unity within the European Union to take the joint effort,"" the ambassador added.

The local governor of the Bashkortostan region reported in a Telegram post that Ukrainian drones attacked the Salavat petrochemical complex, one of Russia's largest. This is the second such attack in less than a week.

""Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat has been subjected to another terrorist drone attack. We are assessing the extent of the damage. All emergency services are on scene, and firefighting measures are underway,"" Radiy Khabirov said.

In recent weeks, Ukraine has intensified its drone attacks on Russia's extensive oil and gas infrastructure, targeting refineries and pipelines destined for export. These attacks come as peace talks with Moscow have stalled.

According to traders and retailers, Russia is experiencing shortages of certain fuel grades because the attacks have reduced refinery output and high borrowing costs prevent private filling stations from stockpiling fuel.

Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly on Monday, US President Donald Trump appeared to shift his rhetoric about the war in Ukraine.

Trump said that, with time, patience, and financial support from Europe and NATO, Ukraine could regain its territory from Russia, which he accused of fighting ""aimlessly.""

Meanwhile, Zelenskyy is scheduled to deliver a speech on Wednesday, the second day of the United Nations General Assembly.

Since October 2023, Israel has killed more than 1,700 medical staff and attacked 38 hospitals. 

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

Israeli attacks have forced a pediatric hospital and the only eye care hospital in Gaza to close, according to Middle East Eye. 

The pediatric hospital, Al-Rantisi Hospital, provides care not available anywhere else in Gaza, the outlet reports.

“There are no safe routes to reach hospitals and medical facilities, preventing patients and the wounded from accessing care,” the Palestinian health ministry said in a statement, as per Middle East Eye. “The occupation is deliberately and systematically targeting the healthcare system in Gaza City as part of its policy of genocide against the population of the Gaza Strip.”

Israel has repeatedly attacked Gaza's hospitals, health care workers, patients, and rescue workers. Since October 2023, Israel has massacred more than 1,700 medical staff and attacked 38 hospitals. 

In July, Israel killed renowned cardiologist Marwan Sultan, the director of Indonesian Hospital, while he was in his home. He was the the 70th health care worker killed by Israel in the previous 50 days, according to Healthcare Workers Watch – Palestine, a group that monitors attacks on Gaza's health care system. His daughter told The New Yorker the “missile was dropped on his room exactly, on his place, on him precisely.” 

“My father was just a doctor, just a human caring for patients,” Ahmad, another one of his children, told NBC News.

In August, Israel bombed Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in a so-called “double tap” strike. Video shows the second strike targeting rescuers who came to the scene. Four health care workers and five journalists were killed in the attack. Since October 2023, Israel has killed more than 200 journalists in Gaza.  

Israel has also abducted, imprisoned, and tortured hundreds of health care workers, many of whom were taken from their hospitals, according to Healthcare Workers Watch – Palestine. 

Those detained have included “irreplaceable consultants and specialists in essential specialities like General Surgery, Vascular Surgery, Orthopaedics Surgery, Anaesthesiology, Intensive Care, Cardiology, Paediatrics, and Obstetrics and Gynaecology,” the group said. 

Twenty of the physicians detained as of July were abducted from their hospitals, three were taken from medical convoys to transfer patients through Israel-designated “safe routes,” and one was kidnapped in front of a hospital, according to Healthcare Workers Watch. 

In December, Israel abducted Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, a pediatrician and director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital. Video shows him walking up to Israeli tanks, wearing his white coat. During his detention he has been beaten with electric shocks and batons, and lost one-third of his body weight. Human rights groups have demanded his release — calls that Israel has ignored.

Israel's blockade on Gaza has deprived surviving health care workers of essential medical supplies, which has forced doctors to perform medical procedures, including amputations on children and cesarean sections, without anesthesia. 

“At every point in their effort to provide care, volunteer health care professionals face systematic practices and policies that directly impact their ability to prevent suffering and loss in Gaza; specifically restrictions that prohibit them from bringing in basic supplies critical to providing lifesaving care,” concluded a report by Physicians for Human Rights. 

“[S]weeping and unpredictable restrictions, imposed by Israeli authorities under the guise of ‘dual use' item limitations, resulted in foreseeable, severe, and often preventable pain and anguish to the women, men, and children who came to them seeking care,” the report continued.

            The Pentagon is terminating a decades-old advisory group that offered recommendations on how to support women serving in the military, including past suggestions that women needed properly fitting body armor and appropriate health care.
    


            Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson said in a post on X on Tuesday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had decided to eliminate the group, formally called the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, saying that the committee, “focused on advancing a divisive feminist agenda that hurts combat readiness.”
    


            “Secretary Hegseth has focused on advancing uniform, sex-neutral standards across the Department,” Wilson said.
    


            The termination of the committee, originally created in 1951 as women were just beginning to take on increased roles in the military, is the latest move by Hegseth who has placed intense scrutiny on Pentagon diversity initiatives.
    


            Late Tuesday Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth added a response on X to Wilson's post announcing the elimination of the committee saying, “Gender neutral, color blind, merit based.”
    


            The group provided advice and policy recommendations to the Secretary of Defense based on visits to US military installations, focus group discussions with service members, discussions with subject matter experts and Pentagon representatives.
    


            The recommendations that came from that research ranged from health care and physical fitness assessments to domestic abuse support, body armor and acquisition policy in military aviation. Many of those recommendations impact men as well as women — things like family planning or parental leave, which is a top reason both men and women cite for why they leave military service.
    


            During the first term of President Donald Trump, in 2018, the committee recommended in a report to the defense secretary that he should require the military services to provide gear that fit women after reports of issues in the services.
    


            “Properly fitting equipment is essential to the success of individual service members as well as the military as a whole,” the 2018 report said.
    


            The work the committee did was largely dependent on the secretary with the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness providing research topics.
    


            “Everything that the committee has done has improved the overall readiness of the entirety of the military,” Dr. Kyleanne Hunter, a Marine Corps veteran who was on the Committee on Women in the Services this year, told CNN. “Doing away with a committee like this is going to be a loss for loss for the country.”
    


            Policies that “have very often gotten labeled as sort of women's issues or women's policies … also help men” according to research by the committee, Hunter said. “They help with the retention of men and the recruitment of men.”
    


            The committee was included in a broader review of Defense Department advisory groups started earlier this year. The review itself wasn't uncommon, Hunter said, but as time went on, meetings were postponed, and activities were suspended. As of Wednesday morning, committee members were still awaiting formal notification of next steps.
    


            The move is the latest in a series by Hegseth that have eliminated efforts to increase the role of women in military leadership and planning.
    


            In April, Hegseth announced he would be ending the Defense Department's Women, Peace, and Security program calling it “yet another woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative.” The program, designed to encourage commanders to consider the impacts of gender on local populations and forces when planning for operations, was enacted by President Donald Trump during his first term and championed by his daughter, Ivanka Trump.
    


            Hegseth has also fired or replaced a number of women in leadership positions in a broader purge of military personnel, including former Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the first woman to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whom he called a “DEI hire” in his 2024 book; Vice Adm. Yvette Davids, the first woman to serve as the superintendent of the Naval Academy; and Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield, who served as the US military representative to NATO. The Trump administration also removed Adm. Linda Fagan, the first woman to lead the Coast Guard.
    


            During his confirmation process, Hegseth came under fire for his repeated past comments about his beliefs that women should not serve in combat in the military.
    


            “Women shouldn't be in combat at all,” Hegseth said in an interview last year. “They're life-givers, not life-takers. I know a lot of wonderful soldiers, female soldiers, who have served, who are great. But they shouldn't be in my infantry battalion.”
    


            He appeared to backtrack during his confirmation hearing when pressed by lawmakers, saying he respects “every single female service member that has put on the uniform,” and insisted standards have been lowered for women though he offered no evidence.

Former FBI special agent Nicole Parker discusses the latest details on the deadly shooting at a Dallas ICE facility during ‘The Faulkner Focus.'

Sources familiar with the investigation into the Dallas immigration facility shooting identified Wednesday's alleged attacker as Joshua Jahn, 29.

The gunman killed two detainees and injured another after opening fire on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility from a nearby building before taking his own life, police say. The detainee who survived was hospitalized in critical condition. 

Jahn fired ""indiscriminately"" at the ICE building, as well as at a van in the sally port where the victims were shot, the Department of Homeland Security said. The three detainees were in an unmarked transport van when they were shot, before Jahn took his own life around 7 a.m., according to the sources. He was found dead with a rifle on a nearby rooftop, authorities said.

A photo posted on X by FBI Director Kash Patel showed what appeared to be rifle-caliber ammunition affixed to a clip. The rounds were engraved with an ""anti-ICE"" message.

Wednesday's shooting happened only miles from Prarieland, Texas, where just two months ago an individual ambushed a separate ICE facility targeting officers. In total, 16 people have been charged in the ambush-style shooting of an Alvarado police officer who was responding to reports of vandalism at the facility.

""These despicable, politically motivated attacks against law enforcement are not a one-off,"" Patel wrote. ""It has to end, and the FBI and our partners will lead these investigative efforts to ensure that those who target our law enforcement are pursued and brought to the fullest extent of justice,"" he added.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said Wednesday's attack targeted law enforcement.

""The attack on ICE in Dallas is yet another despicable assault on law and order,"" he said. ""The epidemic of leftist political violence must end. Democrats have fostered an environment of evil, emboldening radicals to kill, steal, and destroy. But we will never surrender.""

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said his state supports immigration enforcement officers and that the shooter's actions ""will NOT slow our arrest, detention, & deportation of illegal immigrants. We will work with ICE & the Dallas Police Department to get to the bottom of the assassin's motive.""

Vice President JD Vance called for an end to ""obsessive attacks"" on law enforcement, particularly ICE.

""These horrendous killings must serve as a wake-up call to the far left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X, while chiding elected officials who demonize immigration authorities. 

""Comparing ICE day in and day out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences,"" she added. ""The men and women of ICE are fathers and mothers, sons and daughters. They get up every morning to try and make our communities safer. Like everyone else, they just want to go home to their families at night.""

Fox News national correspondent Bill Melugin has the details from Los Angeles on 'America's Newsroom.'

A 24-year-old illegal immigrant from Venezuela who allegedly posed as a teenager and enrolled in an Ohio high school pleaded guilty on Monday to lying on immigration forms and applications to purchase a firearm.

Anthony Emmanuel Labrador-Sierra is accused of using fraudulent documents to pose as a 16-year-old student and enroll in Perrysburg High School, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio said in a news release on Tuesday. Prosecutors say he could face up to 30 years behind bars.

Labrador-Sierra submitted a false date of birth to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on federal applications for Temporary Protective Status and Employment Authorization Documents in 2024 and 2025, according to the indictment.

He also allegedly possessed a Taurus G3C 9mm semiautomatic pistol, which he was not allowed to have since he was in the U.S. illegally. The Justice Department alleges that Labrador-Sierra submitted false information to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to purchase the firearm.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CHARGED WITH REPEATED SEXUAL ASSAULT OF 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL: FLORIDA SHERIFF

Perrysburg Schools said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital in May that Labrador-Sierra had been enrolled at Perrysburg High School under the name and age of a 16-year-old unaccompanied minor on Jan. 11, 2024, in accordance with federal and state requirements for enrolling students experiencing homelessness or without a legal guardian.

Between Jan. 11, 2024, and May 14, 2025, the school system said Labrador-Sierra obtained documentation and support, further complicating the situation. 

Labrador-Sierra ""worked with immigration attorneys to file for Temporary Protective Status, which was granted by the U.S. Immigration Service,"" the school system said. ""This provided him with an Ohio driver's license, a Social Security card, and a work permit.""

Anthony Emmanuel Labrador-Sierra was taken into custody during a traffic stop on Interstate 75 in June. (Perryburg Police Department)

The school also said that Labrador-Sierra had completed an application for a visa with help from Advocating Opportunities, which provides free legal assistance.

Labrador-Sierra had been a member of the junior varsity soccer and swim teams, according to school officials.

Labrador-Sierra had been living with a local family who believed they were helping a homeless teen after the Wood County Juvenile Court granted them guardianship. The guardians contacted the school on May 14 to report they had received information indicating Labrador-Sierra was not a minor, but rather a 24-year-old man.

Labrador Sierra reportedly denied the allegation when district administrators met with him on May 15. He was ultimately taken into custody during a traffic stop on Interstate 75 about a month later.

RFK Jr.'s health policies stem from the idea that the past holds the secret to health and happiness.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

The way we respond to the disappointments, dangers, and defects of the present helps determine our political affiliations. If you think the answers lie somewhere in a future condition we've yet to achieve, then you may be persuaded by progressive politics; if you think the resources for rescuing society lie somewhere in the past, you may be attracted to conservative politics.

This general pattern helps explain the recent alignment of conservative politics and the anti-vaccine movement, despite its long-standing association with crunchy, left-ish causes. Today, the two tendencies have joined in mutual agreement about the wholesomeness of natural health versus modern medicine, indulging in nostalgia for a world before the widespread use of vaccines.

The past does contain its share of treasures, and it can be hard to accept that a world so rife with pain and despair is in certain ways the best it has ever been. But the idea that the past held a secret to health and happiness that we've lost somehow—especially with respect to infectious disease—is a fantasy with potentially lethal ramifications.

Read: The neo-anti-vaxxers are in power now

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the vaccine-skeptical current secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, originally shared politics with the older anti-vaccine advocates, back-to-the-Earth types who themselves demonstrated a conservative impulse in their search for a primeval Eden. (Plenty of left-leaning people persist in that tradition, though it seems better fit for today's right, which has a certain appreciation for the pastoral.) A Democrat until 2023, Kennedy entered public life as a champion of environmental protection, battling against corporate interests in court to keep harmful waste out of the air and water. Over time, this overall concern with modern impurity destroying pristine nature evidently extended to other areas of his thinking. As his career progressed, Kennedy adopted several controversial opinions regarding healthy eating, condemning, among other things, meat issued from factory farms, seed oils, and processed food. In a 2024 campaign video from his presidential-primary run, Kennedy promised to “reverse 80 years of farm policy in this country,” harkening to a time before synthetic pesticides and chemical additives to animal feed.

If a conservative is, as William F. Buckley Jr. famously wrote, someone who “stands athwart history, yelling ‘Stop!'” then Kennedy certainly fits the bill. A proper conservative fights to preserve the status quo. But the most reactionary members of the right won't settle for protecting the ground their party has already staked out; their project is to return to the status quo ante, the way things were in the (sometimes distant) past. The slogan “Make America Great Again” manages to disparage the present while promising a return to an era in which Christianity was nationally dominant, manufacturing jobs were the bedrock of the economy, and the country was ever expanding. Kennedy's positions on processed food and pharmaceuticals fit perfectly into that picture.

“Today's children have to get between 69 and 92 vaccines in order to be fully compliant, between maternity and 18 years,” Kennedy said during a recent Senate hearing about Trump's 2026 health-care agenda, by way of comparison with children of the past, who were required to receive fewer vaccines (if any at all). Likewise, Kennedy has rejected the introduction of fluoride into drinking water, a practice initiated in the mid-1940s to help prevent tooth decay, as well as the pasteurization of milk, which began in the late 19th century. “When I was a kid” in the '50s and '60s, Kennedy said earlier this year, “we were the healthiest, most robust people in the world. And today we're the sickest.”

This is in some respects true, but in other ways dangerously wrong. Kennedy is quick to point out the relative rarity of chronic conditions such as childhood diabetes and autoimmune disorders in the past. But he is apparently hesitant to acknowledge that mid-century America came with its own share of serious health problems, including a high rate of cigarette smoking and horrifying infant mortality rates compared with the present. When Kennedy was young, vaccine-preventable childhood illnesses such as measles routinely killed hundreds annually. So far this year, only three people in the United States have died of measles—largely the result of an outbreak of the disease caused in part by declining vaccination rates. And if modern innovations in food and medicine have come with their share of hazards, it would be wrong to conclude that their predecessors were superior. Raw milk allegedly caused the hospitalization of a toddler and the miscarriage of an unborn child as recently as this summer.

 At the center of the “Make America Healthy Again” crusade is a high degree of trust in the wisdom of nature. But the contemporary appeal of unadulterated nature springs from human successes in controlling the elements; it's hard to romanticize a relatively recent vaccine-free past while considering photographs of children's bodies ravaged by smallpox, a disease that persisted well into the 20th century. Likewise, long before COVID-19, America experienced cholera and flu pandemics with hundreds of thousands of associated deaths, as well as lesser outbreaks of illnesses such as diphtheria, polio, and pertussis, all three of which were notorious child-killers. Today, the rarity of those conditions has fostered a false sense of security, and a naive assessment of the natural world. Relinquishing the successes of general vaccine coverage, however, is guaranteed to belie the idea that untainted nature contains all the keys to health and wellness. Our historical moment has enough strife without revisiting past battles fought and won.

﻿A conservative explains what Kirk meant to the MAGA movement — and how it's reacting to his death.

It is impossible, I think, to grasp the terrible consequences of Charlie Kirk's death without understanding who he was in life.

Liberals had a dim view of that track record — focusing on his often-offensive radio broadcasts and contributions to Trump's authoritarian project (like sending seven buses to the January 6 protest). However, to conservatives, he was something very different: not just an effective political organizer but a living symbol of democratic politics done the right way.

I must admit that this second perspective doesn't come naturally to me. But I wanted to understand it better, so I reached out to Tanner Greer — a conservative author and essayist who had written brilliantly about what Kirk meant to the right on his blog The Scholar's Stage.

In his piece, Greer argues that Kirk was “the indispensable man” on the populist right: Nobody else had his genius for organization or his extensive connections with nearly everyone of note in the MAGA movement. On an ideological level, per Greer, Kirk represented a vision of politics in which the populist right competes on the left's turf, from universities to elections, and wins in direct political combat. In this, he stood against MAGA's most radical anti-democratic voices.

The ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.

So when he was killed, Greer explains, his many friends and allies saw it as proof that the broader left was now incapable of coexisting with even someone as genial and small-d democratic as Kirk — giving rise to the vehement, even authoritarian, response of people like Stephen Miller and JD Vance. Now, much of the right believes it's their turn to seize control of culture, to have a version of the left's “George Floyd moment” of 2020.

I didn't agree with much of the thinking Greer described. But I found his explanation of it, to borrow a phrase, “indispensable.”

He helped me understand why leading Republicans blame an ill-defined “they” for Kirk's killing, rather than a shooter who seemingly acted alone, and just how emotional these conservatives must be in the wake of Kirk's passing. If we are to keep sharing a country, you need to understand this perspective — perhaps especially if you disagree with it.

What follows is a transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.

Tell me what you think most people who only knew Kirk from his radio broadcasts missed about him.

Second only to Donald Trump himself, Kirk is probably the most important individual in creating the current intellectual and organizational landscape of the MAGA movement. You wouldn't get any of this at all if all you knew of him was some guy who's willing to say shocking things on the internet.

In the piece, I suggest there's [several] aspects of Charlie Kirk that made him a very powerful individual.

First, the size of his audience. His radio show had about 500,000 people who listened to it. His TikTok channel had 7 million followers. He's had campus debates that had upwards of 2 billion views in total all across the world. 5 million Twitter followers on top of that. So he had this giant megaphone. If he wanted to come out and publicly take a position, Republicans would listen.

The second thing that he had was TPUSA and the little organizations that were built off of it. TPUSA is a very large, 850- to 900-chapter organization. This is a mass mobilization machine. This is a mass talent-building machine, as future political leaders often come from people who were TPUSA chapter leaders in their universities. And then on top of that, he builds these other outreach organizations. He has a giant outreach organization for evangelical church leaders.

Then he has a vote-getting machine that is very active in swing states in the 2024 election — most Republicans seem to think that TPUSA's Turning Point Action Committee might've gotten 10 to 20,000 votes in Arizona, which is basically the margin of a [close] election. They had perfected the strategy of basically primarying people for not being MAGA enough in Arizona, which is TPSUA's organizational home, and they were going to go state to state to state in the near future.

Your third source of power is that he's this connector.

Donors love him. He's famously charismatic. Because he himself had kind of raised up this whole generation of new activists, he knew who was the best potential staffers or the best potential state House candidates or congressional candidates. There are several congressional candidates who came from TPUSA and are in Congress right now. And because he was running this podcast where he's talking to the existing class of staffers, the existing media magnates, the existing politicians, he's at the center of this network of people. And this is probably one of his most important roles in the right, especially the more MAGA right. He was constantly working to get people from one part or one of these constituencies to meet them with somebody else.

You wrote, “There are a good four dozen people in the Trump administration who owe their appointments to an introduction Kirk made on their behalf. And this was not only true of the Trump administration, but also across Congress and state governments and in news agencies like Fox News.“

It's a guesstimate. The number might be underestimated — because Kirk was involved in a very personal way in vetting for this administration's appointments.

You have to understand the right has a problem: We have a much smaller talent pool than the left. And if you are restricting it even further, if you need to restrict your talent pool to people who are more MAGA — people [who] can pass a Laura Loomer test — then you have an even smaller number of potential people. And so Kirk basically spends all the months of November and December and January, every day, meeting with [then-White House personnel director] Sergio Gor, talking about, “Here's somebody who might be good for this position, here's somebody who shouldn't be in that position.” And he wasn't the only one doing that, but he was a big part of getting people in the door and keeping some people out.

But this isn't just true for little [roles]. This is true for Cabinet members. JD Vance is there because of Charlie Kirk.

During 2024, Charlie Kirk took a three-month break from TPUSA to basically be Don Jr.‘s manager. And Kirk sends a text to Don and says [something like], “I know that this guy [Vance] said these things about how Trump was Hitler back in the time, but he's had a conversion. He's one of us now. You need to meet with him. You need to take him seriously. You need to introduce him to your dad.”

That's how JD Vance got in with cahoots with Trump in the first place, just because of Charlie Kirk. If you listen to the Charlie Kirk radio show that JD Vance hosted, he mentions this story. And almost every single person they had from the administration come on has a very similar story. There's half a dozen Cabinet-level or people just below that who can say, “Kirk advocated for me to have this position, and that helped tip the balance.”

You can hear that not just in what they said, but the way in which they said it, in the obvious pathos and emotionality that came across in the discussions of Kirk during that radio broadcast or during the funeral on Sunday night. They all say that they genuinely cared for Kirk. 

Part of me thinks, “Well, everybody on the right wants to have been close to him now.” But listening to you talk and listening to some of the stories people tell, I think this is just actually true: that he really did mean a lot to a lot of the people that are in power right now. And so part of this vehement political reaction to Kirk's death is born out of this deep emotional and personal connection with him.

I think that's correct. If you look at the MAGA movement as a whole, Kirk was a lot of people's friend. That's why all these donors are able to give him so much money. He was very good at being very optimistic and being like, “We're going to win, we can do this,” cheering people up.

This position at the center of the MAGA world network — in addition to these kind of institutional things that he built up, the big megaphone he had, his ability to basically leverage all of that into helping other people make connections — made him sort of an indispensable pillar of the movement.

So when he was shot, that was really not just an attack on somebody who says very controversial things. This is a person who helped pioneer [not only] the message, but also the institutions and the organizational networks of the current version of the right. And he did it by the time he was 31. An immensely talented individual.

One thing that's also struck me in the responses and the way that these figures talk about Kirk's death is the omnipresence of the word “they. It's “they” killed Charlie, “they” took Charlie from us, even though there's no evidence that the shooter was in any kind of conspiracy. 

So what do people on the right mean by “they?”

When George Floyd died in 2020, there was not a sense that this was the action of a single policeman, and if we put him in jail, then the problem's over. There was rather a sense that you could only have a person like this policeman, who's willing to stand on the neck of a Black man he's just arrested until he dies — this could only happen if you have a larger systemic problem in America.

I think many, many people on the right want to have their own version of the 2020 moment, partially because their analysis is very structurally similar to how leftists thought about racism in 2020. They think there's larger structural problems — that [the shooter] only can exist because of a larger culture that supports his conduct, excuses it, and allows it to happen.

All these people went through 2020 and they want to have a similar reckoning, because that was experienced by the right as a very harrowing event — where essentially every single institution in the United States, every university, every provost, most corporations all gave out statements talking about how what happened was an act of evil and we need to nationally atone for the sin. If you didn't agree with that stuff, this felt very oppressive to you, like you were being chased out of the public sphere.

And I think this is the easiest way to make sense of why some people on the right feel very strongly that we need to do things like, say, take Jimmy Kimmel off the air.

They remember 2020, and they feel like if Jimmy Kimmel had gone against Black Lives Matter, he would've been taken off the air without the state. And we don't have that same activist network [as the left], but we do have the state. And so we should try to create the same sort of structural cultural change that was imposed upon us in the Great Awokening.

Help me understand that comparison a little bit more. In the George Floyd scenario, it's pretty easy to see what the structural roots of Derek Chauvin's actions are — a policing sector, and a society more broadly, shot through with racism. 

But in the Kirk case, what's the equivalent force that created Kirk's killer? Is it left-wing animosity toward conservatism? Is it mainstream liberal ideology? What is the thing that the violence against Kirk is supposed to be an outgrowth of? Who specifically are “they” that embody whatever the structure is?

This “they” will differ from person to person. I don't think there's a consensus. The possible options for “they” range from, at the narrowest, the kind of antifa people who are willing to use or at least endorse violence on the left. [At the broadest], it's all the way to a [liberal] culture that sees Trump as inherently illegitimate and un-American and [as someone who] should be deplatformed.

Just to give you an example: Somebody was making a big deal out of a tweet that Vice President Harris had written in 2019, saying how basically, if we're being honest with ourselves, Trump should be kicked off Twitter by now because of his bad comments. That was cited as an example of the left's inherent desire to kick us out of public spaces. Very similar to when Hillary Clinton says, “[Half of] Trump supporters are a basket of deplorables.”

If you're dehumanizing us, if you're calling us deplorable, you're basically saying we're outside of the pale of American politics — then you are part of the “they” who basically dehumanizes someone like Kirk enough that he should be killed. I think that's how they would say it.

I'm not trying to weigh in with my own opinions on this. I just want to understand better what is this “they”? Because to me, it seems analytically incoherent. JD Vance, for example, has brought up the Open Society Foundation, which in no plausible world had anything to do with Charlie Kirk's death. But it was one of Vance's political enemies.

Many actors on the right have for many years believed — and I have a lot of sympathies with this set of beliefs — that a lot of what the left has been about for the last decade, since the Great Awokening started, is basically making it difficult for conservatives to be part of the public sphere in a safe and confident way.

And that word “safe” is interesting because when you start talking about safety, you can start roping in several different streams, which I don't think liberals would necessarily associate with each other, into one system. This allows you to say, okay, people being deplatformed on campuses, that's one version of us not being able to participate publicly. All the way to the riots in 2020, which a lot of conservatives felt Democratic cities and the sitting government allowed — which made it impossible for a person like me to be in these urban spaces for X amount of time. They made these cities too dangerous for us to be in.

And that's where people will do this kind of mining, where, okay, Soros funded this Black Lives Matter-adjacent organization, which was making excuses for rioters here. That's where they'll kind of all connect that together.

Someone like you, you'll look at that and say, “Well, what does that have to do with Charlie Kirk being assassinated by this [lone wolf]?” And I think a lot of people on the right will say, “No, no, no, this is a large systemic thing. All you guys excused the violence in 2020, excused antifa, excused taking over CHAZ, excused all this stuff because you normatively agreed with it and thought that Trump was bad enough that that this sort of violence was okay. And that's the same attitude, that's the same world that creates young guys who want to go and shoot one of our most prominent leaders.”

I think that's how they would connect those dots.

Now, how does that attitude relate to something you talk about in the article at length, which is Kirk's role in giving young conservatives permission to be themselves publicly in places like a university?

This question of what he meant to the young conservatives is quite relevant to this larger question: What is the “they”?

The way I explain it in this piece — this is really hard for liberals to believe — is that, if you were a young conservative on campus from 2013 to 2022, you felt afraid. Even when Trump was in power, a lot of these conservatives felt afraid. And this fear is really core to a lot of what has happened, I mean, really in this administration as well as people's reactions to Kirk's death.

If you were a young person on the right — you believe something like transgenderism is a lie or a mental disease, which is a pretty standard belief on the right — you were afraid to say what you believed because you felt like you would be socially ostracized, people on campus would bully you, harass you, treat you differently, you would have professors who might grade you differently, you wouldn't have good job prospects, you would be afraid of becoming a viral example.

This is the environment in which TPUSA begins its giant rise. And Kirk's campus tours, the sort of thing he was doing when he was shot, this is actually what they're designed to combat. Yes, they created some viral clips, but that really was not their main purpose. Because Kirk was a campus activist first, a media figure second.

The purpose of these was for Kirk to go into these universities and say, “Hey, guys, look, we can be part of the public sphere. There are more of you than it seems. You guys are all afraid to stand up and show you're conservative. I'm going to come here, I'm going to organize a TPUSA chapter, and you're going to see that you're not alone. Second, I'm going to go and debate all these people around you, anyone who wants to come up. A professor, a student, anyone who wants to can come and debate me. And I can show you guys that these beliefs we have are defendable. We can stand up, we can be part of the public sphere.”

And so there's a lot of young conservatives who basically say, “Charlie Kirk made me unafraid to be an activist. Charlie Kirk is the one who made me unafraid to stand up for what I believed.”

Without someone like Charlie, the only people who would stand up for their conservative beliefs tended to be either extremely principled people or they were just assholes who like to be disagreeable. I'm sure you've probably met both of those sorts when you were in college. If you want to have a movement that isn't just people like that, you have to find some way to inspire people to stand up. And that's what Kirk was doing. He's modeling to all these kids, look, you guys can do this too.

And that's who was murdered. And so when the guy whose whole message is “you don't have to be afraid” is shot, then it makes some sense why people might be feeling afraid.

That's where I wanted to bring us to at the end: how both sides should feel about their enemies.

I have this fear, given Kirk's personal significance, that the right's authoritarian reaction to his death is not going to be a short-lived thing — you may disagree. But if Charlie Kirk was trying to create a politics where people who disagree could engage, the aftermath of his death is destroying that possibility. It's making it very, very, very difficult for people across partisan lines to view each other with anything but mistrust and suspicion.

So what are we supposed to do about that?

I think there's a little bit of a crossroads here. I think the right has to decide whether Kirk's life or his death is the thing that should be remembered.

I think that Kirk's life, although many aspects of it are very repellent to people on the left, is an example of how this conservative national populist thing can be done without authoritarian measures and be very popular. I personally am on the side of saying, “Guys, look, Kirk actually showed us the path for how to make this work, and we'd be stupid if we left it for something that we don't know if it will work.”

What I've been telling people on the right is, if you seriously believe you're going to have a 2020 moment, you guys are somewhat deluding yourselves. Because 2020 had very many special things that led up to it.

Obviously, you had a pandemic, everyone was cooped in their house and wanted to get out and be out. But in addition to that, you had years of activism. Black Lives Matter started seven years before 2020. And the New York Times had basically doubled its reporting on racism and racial problems in America in the three years that preceded 2020.

You had a huge amount of intellectual work being done. You had a huge amount of activism being done. And in many ways, 2020 was the culmination of a decade's worth of theorizing and activism and changing public opinion. So I don't think this attempt to use the state to have a 2020 moment is going to work. I just don't think the public is there: I think it's going to backfire.

And I understand, too, that certain people have a bad opinion of Kirk. But I do think that the impulse of some on the left to take this moment to say, “Well, Charlie Kirk was just this terrible person in all these ways, he said this terrible and that terrible thing, and we're being censored if we don't see otherwise” — to put it very frankly, lots of people on the [more radical] right are very happy to see those takes.

The debate the right has been having for a long time is “Do we think that the other side can live with us? How much of a threat really are they to us?” And so when the reaction of some people is to condemn the violence, but then talk about how actually it's good that he's gone, which is more or less what these people do, it sounds more like you are part of this structure of ideas that makes it acceptable for right-wing people to be killed.

A lot of people, a lot of politicians, understand this and have gone out of their way not to be inflammatory on all this. I think clearly this is what [former Vox co-founder and now New York Times columnist] Ezra Klein was thinking when he wrote that editorial. But he got dragged through the mud for that, and he really had to justify himself showing up, talking to people on the right.

Maybe it's helpful if folks on the left don't just discount Kirk as that terrible racist who says all these terrible things. If that's the message you took away from all this, I think you'll really misunderstand both what Kirk meant to the movement, but also what his death means to the movement as well.

 Bitcoin's bullish divergences on the RSI metric, along with record-low volatility, were early signs that the rally to $113,900 was in the making. Is the sell-off over? 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin bounced to $113,900 after testing weekly lows, fueled by bullish divergences.

Whale-sized entities have sold 147,000 BTC since August, signaling supply pressure.

Bitcoin options implied volatility hit multi-year lows, hinting at a potential explosive move.

Bitcoin (BTC) staged a swift recovery to $113,900 on Wednesday after sweeping below Monday's low of $111,500 and briefly testing the $111,000 mark on Binance during the Asia trading session. The bounce signaled an early attempt at mid-week recovery, supported by emerging bullish signals on the charts.

One of the key drivers behind the rebound is the bullish divergence between the relative strength index (RSI) and the BTC price on the one-hour and four-hour charts. A bullish divergence occurs when the price registers lower lows while the RSI forms higher lows, often indicating a waning bearish momentum and potential for a reversal.

The recovery also coincided with Bitcoin retesting its daily order block, providing a technical base for a possible push toward $115,000. Still, stronger confirmation is needed. 

A four-hour candle close above $113,400 would signal a clear shift from bearish to bullish structure. Additionally, reclaiming the 200-period exponential moving average (EMA) on the four-hour chart would reinforce positive momentum. 

Crypto traders offered mixed reactions to the move. MN Capital founder Michaël van de Poppe noted the strength of the rebound, stating,

Crypto trader Crypto Chase cautioned that Bitcoin must reclaim the $113,400 to $114,000 range with conviction, or else the recent gains could unravel, sending BTC back toward $107,000.

While Bitcoin's short-term recovery is gaining traction, broader onchain trends reveal diverging signals. Earlier, Cointelegraph reported that whale entities holding 1,000 BTC or more have sold off roughly 147,000 BTC, worth $16.5 billion, since Bitcoin's all-time high above $124,500 in August. 

The 2.7% reduction in holdings highlighted sustained selling pressure from large investors, often interpreted as a headwind for price recovery.

Yet, other market indicators suggest the broader environment remained unusually quiet rather than decisively bearish. XWIN Research pointed out that Bitcoin's implied volatility has dropped to its lowest levels since October 2023, a period that preceded a 325% rally from $29,000 to $124,000 for BTC.

The analysis described the current setup as a potential “quiet before the storm,” where low volatility and muted trader positioning may be storing momentum for a decisive move.

Supporting this view, CryptoQuant data underscored exchange reserves hovering at multi-year lows, leaving fewer coins available for selling. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio sits near the neutral zone, implying limited pressure for either panic-selling or aggressive profit-taking. 

Together, these factors painted a market caught between whale-driven distribution and a structural backdrop of tightening supply.

Bitcoin price resistance explained through limited whale selling pressure absorbed by growing ETF allocations amid broader market gains.

The Bitcoin price has been trapped in the same range since early July while equities, gold, real estate, and commodities like silver have all pushed to new highs. The question is why Bitcoin is lagging while nearly every other major asset is rallying.

On-chain data shows that whales holding more than one hundred bitcoin have recently begun transferring large amounts after years of inactivity. These movements have historically lined up with cycle tops or periods of heightened BTC volatility. This suggests that some of Bitcoin's longest-term holders are realizing profits or rotating positions.

The current wave of transfers is significant but smaller relative to total circulating supply than what was seen in prior peaks. The number of unique whales selling is also lower, which means selling pressure looks concentrated among a handful of players rather than a broad distribution across the entire cohort of long-term holders.

While whales are distributing, steady inflows into ETFs and treasury allocations continue to absorb supply. This balance explains why BTC price has remained stable instead of collapsing, even as whale selling picked up. The market appears to be in a tug of war between old holders exiting and institutional demand stepping in.

BTC remains pinned in a tight range as supply and demand offset each other. If equities and commodities stay stretched at highs, capital could rotate into BTC as the next target, providing the catalyst for a breakout. For now, Bitcoin's price stability reflects an unusual balance between whale distribution and institutional accumulation, setting the stage for the next decisive move.

BySandy Carter,

Contributor.

Ethereum treasuries are revolutionizing corporate finance, moving beyond idle Bitcoin holdings. Companies are now actively using ETH as a productive, yield-bearing asset through staking and DeFi lending, generating 3-5% returns. Liquid staking offers flexibility, allowing businesses to earn income while maintaining access to capital. This shift makes ETH a new, powerful tool for treasury management, impacting both large institutions and small businesses globally.

Ethereum treasuries are quietly becoming one of the most consequential shifts in corporate finance. 

When the first corporate treasuries began buying Bitcoin and Bitcoin ETFs, it made headlines. Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Square put digital gold on their balance sheets as a hedge against inflation and as a bet on a new monetary standard. Ethereum is quietly charting a different path (changing the world in different ways) that could prove even more transformative for corporate finance — and increasingly relevant for smaller businesses and investors too.

According to the Block, nearly 70 organizations now hold more than 17 billion dollars worth of ETH directly, while ETFs account for another 25 billion. Together, close to 10% of Ethereum's circulating supply is now under institutional control. An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a familiar stock market product that lets investors buy and sell Ethereum the same way they trade Apple or Microsoft stock, without ever touching crypto directly.

That scale is remarkable, but the real story lies in what institutions are doing with their ETH. Unlike Bitcoin, which often sits idle on corporate balance sheets, Ethereum treasuries are yield-bearing assets. 

Ethereum itself is more than just a digital coin. It is a programmable blockchain, like a global computer, where apps for finance, art, and identity are built. The coin, called ETH, is valuable both because it can be traded and because it powers those applications.

According to Seeking Alpha, companies such as BitMine and SharpLink are now staking billions of dollars of ETH to generate predictable income streams. Staking is like putting money in a savings account, but instead of a bank paying you, the Ethereum network pays you for helping to keep it running. This is not speculation. It is balance sheet engineering. By staking or lending ETH, treasuries reduce circulating liquidity while creating new sources of revenue.

According to Yellow.com, when ETH is staked, it generates yields in the range of 3 to 5%, often more than government bonds. ETH can also be deployed into lending markets, collateralized for credit, or structured into financial products.

Traditional staking locks ETH away, which can be a problem if a company suddenly needs access to its capital. This is where liquid staking comes in. 

Think of it like a CD at the bank. With a CD, you earn interest but cannot touch the money until it matures. Liquid staking is like earning that same interest, but also getting a certificate you can borrow against, trade, or even spend while your deposit keeps working for you.

For businesses, this is powerful because treasuries often need flexibility. They may want yield but also need to cover expenses or seize an opportunity on short notice. Liquid staking gives them both: productive assets and working capital.

In Europe, liquid staking products have already been wrapped into regulated funds and exchange-traded products, allowing family offices and corporates to adopt the strategy without losing liquidity. Examples include Lido's stETH and Rocket Pool's rETH, which give holders a token they can move freely while still earning staking rewards. European adoption shows that liquid staking is not theory but an established practice that provides a roadmap for U.S. institutions.

This matters well beyond Fortune 500 CFOs. 

A local business with extra reserves could stake a small amount of ETH to earn yield, much like putting idle cash to work in a savings account. A nonprofit could hold a fraction of its treasury in Ethereum ETFs to diversify beyond cash and bonds. Everyday investors could treat ETH staking like a higher-yield alternative to a bank account, understanding that the risks are different but the principle is similar — turning savings into income.

Paul Frambot, CEO and co-founder of Morpho, the second largest lending protocol, emphasizes why risk safeguards are central here. “For institutions to adopt ETH treasuries at scale, they need the same credit and liquidity safeguards they expect in traditional finance. We are already seeing fintechs use DeFi lending as infrastructure, and corporate treasuries are following the same path. The difference is that Ethereum gives them programmable and transparent rails.”

Institutions are beginning to establish a treasury playbook for Ethereum.

Sam MacPherson, CEO of Phoenix Labs and co-founder behind Spark, explains the two most important sources of yield in practice.  “When it comes to ETH, most of the fundamental yield comes from staking. I expect that actually to expand as more use cases in crypto come. Then there are onchain crypto lending markets such as SparkLend. These are people who are borrowing stablecoins. They have some ETH or Bitcoin, and want more exposure to the asset. So they'll borrow stablecoins on an onchain market, and lever up that way, and they're usually willing to pay a premium on top of the more base rate in TradFi.”

These playbooks are not just about squeezing out returns. They point to a deeper shift in how companies treat digital assets. ETH is not simply something to hold on the side of the balance sheet. It is becoming a productive working asset.

For investors, that means ETH is starting to look less like a speculative token and more like a hybrid between a growth stock and a bond — combining upside with regular yield. For businesses, it means treasury management is evolving. Where once the choice was between cash, bonds, or equities, ETH now represents a new category.

Kean Gilbert, Head of Institutional at the Lido Ecosystem Foundation, highlights this rotation.  “Institutional money is rotating into Ethereum because ETH is both productive and liquid. That is a major change from Bitcoin reserves. This is not just holding crypto, it is re-engineering corporate digital asset strategy around programmable yield.”

Several hurdles still need to be addressed. Risk management remains central, from validator penalties to smart contract exploits. Liquidity versus lockup is a real tradeoff, since staking yields require time commitments and occasional withdrawal delays. Liquid staking reduces this friction, but it still introduces complexity and counterparty risk.

Regulation adds another layer of uncertainty. The SEC has raised questions about whether staking counts as a securities offering, while Europe has taken a more favorable approach with Ethereum ETFs and liquid staking products. Finally, governance questions remain: who decides how ETH treasuries are deployed, the CFO, the board, or specialized committees?

Ethereum treasuries are becoming the next big business strategy. ETH serves a dual role: a strategic reserve asset and a yield-bearing instrument. That combination is powerful. In the coming years, we may see treasuries managed like corporate bond portfolios, balancing staking, lending, liquid staking, and ETF exposure.

Platforms such as Lido, Spark, and Morpho may emerge as the BlackRock or Fidelity equivalents of Ethereum treasuries, building the rails that allow adoption at scale. More broadly, Ethereum is evolving into the financial operating system for balance sheets — from global corporations to local businesses to everyday investors.

Ethereum treasuries are not simply digital reserves. They represent a new kind of financial strategy: programmable, productive, and accessible. 

The question is no longer whether ETH belongs in a portfolio, but how much, and how to manage it responsibly at scale.

 Growing Wall Street crypto adoption and agentic AI platforms may catalyze a “supercycle” for Ethereum, according to BitMine, the largest corporate holder of Ether. 

Update Sept. 24, 1:07 p.m. UTC: This article has been updated to include quotes from Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at crypto intelligence platform Nansen.

The cryptocurrency market may experience its first extended cycle due to more institutional capital and trading products in the Web3 industry, making digital asset investments more accessible.

Some investors predict a crypto “supercycle” that may invalidate the theory of the four-year crypto market cycle related to the Bitcoin (BTC) halving, and see digital asset valuation rise beyond this historic time frame.

For the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), the supercycle may be catalyzed by Wall Street's growing adoption of blockchain technology, according to BitMine Immersion Technologies, the world's largest corporate Ether holder.

The first major driver for Ether may be “Wall Street running into the blockchain,” according to BitMine, the largest corporate holder of ETH.

Despite the optimism around a potential supercycle, not all Wall Street participants are so bullish on Ether's price trajectory.

US investment bank Citigroup has set a $4,300 year-end price target for Ether, which is significantly below ETH's all-time high of $4,953, surpassed on Aug. 24.

“Current prices are above activity estimates, potentially driven by recent buying pressure and excitement over use-cases,” Citi wrote in a Monday note seen by Reuters.

Ether has risen by about 108% in the past six months and traded at $4,177 at the time of writing, TradingView data shows.

BitMine sees the growing adoption of agentic artificial intelligence protocols as the second potential catalyst for an incoming Ethereum supercycle.

AI agents will require a “neutral platform” such as a public blockchain, which could bring more applications to Ethereum, the biggest smart contract platform.

“For AI to be really valuable, it has to be an economic actor. So AI agents have to be able to buy things and get money,” according to Ben Horowitz, co-founder and general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).

“If you're an AI, you're not allowed to have a credit card,” said Horowitz in a Tuesday X post. “Crypto is like the economic network for AI,” he added.

“While many things still are being built on Ethereum, that does not necessarily mean that Ethereum will be the biggest or most obvious winner if this prediction comes to be,” Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at crypto intelligence platform Nansen, told Cointelegraph. “Virtuals and other ‘agent AI' have been built on Base, a decent bunch on Solana and also some that have their own chains.”

“As such, there is an increasing likelihood of competition across chains, rather than one chain reigning supreme,” he added.

AI agents are software programs designed to automate and execute specific tasks on behalf of users.

Autonomous onchain agents can interact with blockchain protocols, enabling functionalities such as trading, token swaps, portfolio management and engaging with decentralized finance platforms.

Some of the largest fintech firms are investing in AI agents. On Sept. 2, PayPal Ventures led a Series A funding round into decentralized AI infrastructure provider, Kite AI, raising $18 million to bring its cumulative funding to $33 million, Cointelegraph reported.

Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic has secured a strategic investment from HSBC, making it the only company in the sector to be backed by four globally systemically important banks (G-SIBs). HSBC joins JPMorgan Chase, Santander and Wells Fargo on Elliptic's investor roster.

As part of the deal, Richard May, Group Head of Financial Crime at HSBC's corporate and institutional banking arm, will take a seat on Elliptic's board.

Elliptic's technology is used by financial institutions, crypto exchanges and governments to monitor blockchain transactions for signs of financial crime. With HSBC's investment, Elliptic says it will step up hiring and expand its footprint in financial services.

“For over a decade, we've anticipated the enterprise adoption of digital assets and have invested in the robustness, scale and compliance capabilities required by global financial institutions,” said Elliptic CEO Simone Maini. “This is validation of our vision and the market's growing needs.”

May said HSBC's decision reflects the need for greater visibility into digital asset flows as regulation tightens.

“With the rapid evolution of digital assets and currencies, mitigating financial crime risks has never been more important,” he said. “Elliptic's solution provides HSBC with greater transparency, helping to meet rising regulatory expectations and industry standards.”

Maini, who joined Elliptic more than a decade ago after a career in banking and financial crime compliance, described HSBC's involvement as the natural next step in a long relationship.

“As is often the case with these sorts of relationships, it usually starts with some kind of commercial exploration,” she told CoinDesk. “When you see a strategic imperative aligning with a high-potential company, it can lead back to the venture investing team inside the bank, and ultimately that's where we landed.”

She said May's appointment to the board will bring a new dimension: “We don't currently have a financial crime practitioner on our board, it's mostly investor backgrounds. Rich brings that 360-degree perspective from both banking and government, and I think it's going to have a massive influence.”

Elliptic has been riding a wave of demand from banks exploring stablecoins and tokenized assets. Earlier this year it launched a tool called Issuer Due Diligence to help banks assess wallet risks before holding stablecoin reserves.

Maini said the firm is also pushing ahead with an “AI-driven roadmap,” including a compliance-focused copilot launched this year to shorten onboarding times for banks entering crypto. Another priority is expanding blockchain coverage: 

“We don't ever want to say no to a customer. If they want to screen transactions on a new network, we need to be ready.”

Bitwise Asset Management says ETH$4,177.62 is rapidly cementing its place as a treasury asset.

Digital asset treasuries (DATs), once largely bitcoin-centric, are now allocating to ether at scale, creating structural demand that exceeds net new supply, the firm said in a Monday report.

""ETH treasuries are no longer a side story. They are becoming a structural pillar in crypto's capital markets,"" analyst Max Shannon wrote.

According to Bitwise, that demand is reinforced by real yield from transaction fees and maximal extractable value (MEV), which deepens ether's scarcity narrative.

The largest five treasuries, the firm says, reflect a diverse set of strategies, from corporate accumulation and staking to foundations divesting ether to fund ecosystem development. 

This diversity highlights the cryptocurrency's dual identity as both a reserve asset and a productive, yield-bearing instrument, the report said.

Looking forward, Bitwise expects the landscape to consolidate, with “mega whale” and “whale” DATs dominating flows. 

Ether is carving out a distinctive role, not just as a hedge or speculative play, but as a programmable treasury asset that links corporate finance with on-chain economics, the report added.

BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), chaired by Tom Lee, said on Monday that it now controls more than 2% of ether's supply and has raised $365 million to expand its holdings.

XLM Consolidates After Sharp Decline, Testing Key Support Levels

Bitcoin's (BTC) break below key support has prompted a flurry of 'buy the dip' calls on social media. However, liquidity trends suggest a potential for a deeper decline.

BTC has dropped over 3% to $111,590 this week, piercing the widely-tracked 50- and 100-day simple moving averages (SMA). Both indicators have lost their upward momentum for the first time since April, now flatlining to signal caution for bulls.

Meanwhile, mentions of ""buy the dip"" on social media have surged to their highest level in nearly a month, a telltale sign of bullish sentiment among retail investors, according to data tracking platform Santiment. The platform tracks ""buy the dip"" mentions using its social trends indicator, which analyses the volume of relevant keywords and phrases across Reddit, Telegram and X (formerly Twitter).

A spike in these mentions is considered a contrarian signal by Santiment, meaning the ongoing price pullback in BTC could deepen.

""Prices typically move [in] the opposite direction of the crowd's expectations. So if retail traders believe that $112,200 is finally the time to buy, then a little more pain needs to be felt. Once the crowd stops feeling optimistic, and they begin to sell their bags at a loss, this is typically the time to strike with your dip buys,"" Santiment said in a market analysis note.

Analysis of order book liquidity also suggests scope for a continued move lower.

According to Hyblock Capital, the deepest liquidity cluster, marked by concentration of buy/sell orders, is seen at $107,000. The level can act as a magnet, pulling the price down, Hyblock explained on X.

Order book liquidity refers to the concentration and availability of buy and sell orders at different price levels in the order book for a specific asset. It reflects market depth and liquidity by showing the volume available to buy or sell at each price.

Large liquidity levels, such as $107,000, can effectively absorb incoming supply and demand, helping to stabilize prices. Additionally, traders often place buy orders near these levels, anticipating a price bounce, which creates a self-reinforcing support effect.

According to Hyblock, smaller but growing liquidity pools are also seen at $109,000 and $111,000.

 Chainalysis APAC policy lead Chengyi Ong says favorable policy and taxes helped boost crypto in Japan, while stablecoins were popular across the Asia Pacific. 

Japan's recent policy shifts have helped the country more than double its crypto adoption over the past year, according to crypto analytics company Chainalysis.

Among the top five markets in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region, Japan saw the strongest growth, with its value received onchain growing 120% year-on-year in the 12 months to June, according to an excerpt from Chainalysis' 2025 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report released on Wednesday.

Chainalysis' head of APAC policy, Chengyi Ong, told Cointelegraph that activity in Japan “reflects some of the trends that we saw in the global market, a sharp pickup in trading volumes in the fourth quarter of 2024 on the back of the US presidential election, followed by a tapering.”

Meanwhile, Atsushi Kuwabara, chief business development officer at Japanese crypto exchange Bitbank, told Cointelegraph that the company had seen “steady growth in platform usage year over year” to August for both new and returning users.

Japan has looked to reform its crypto laws to align the sector's rules with the traditional securities market and change its taxation rules to lower taxes on crypto. Last month, the country's regulators also greenlit the first stablecoin pegged to the yen.

“Japan's growth is on the heels of important advances in its crypto industry,” Chainalysis said. “For some time now, regulatory restrictions have constrained the listing of stablecoins on domestic exchanges, although this is now beginning to change.”

Ong said that market activity in Japan “has been stable but subdued relative to regional peers like South Korea,” but crypto use in the country “is likely to be boosted by expectations of upcoming policy changes.”

Chainalysis' report added that the growth in crypto value received doubled in Indonesia, South Korea and India, which showed “continued expansion but from already high baselines,” while a 55% growth in Vietnam suggested a “maturing market where crypto is already deeply embedded in remittances and everyday financial activity.”

The company noted its report earlier this month found the Asia Pacific was the “fastest-growing region in the world in terms of onchain value received,” with India topping its Global Adoption Index.

In the future, the markets “will be keenly watching” how stablecoins such as USDC (USDC) and the recently greenlighted JPYC gain traction, Chainalysis said.

Ong said that stablecoins are “becoming a key component in APAC's crypto adoption trends,” and are prominent across several of the region's markets.

She added that South Korea, in particular, saw banks take a “keen interest” in the development of stablecoin laws, and Chainalysis reported that stablecoin trading volumes jumped by over 50% early this year, with total purchases reaching $59 billion in the year to June.

“USD-backed stablecoins have gained significant traction in that market,” Ong said. “It will be interesting to see whether that dynamic shifts when we eventually get won-backed stablecoins.”

She added that Australia “will also be an interesting one to watch in the future” with its recent shift in its treatment of stablecoins.

“Even though legislation has been slow to materialize, regulators recently licensed one stablecoin under the existing financial services regime, and took steps to facilitate usage by granting regulatory relief to distributors,” Ong said.

Chainalysis reported that the top five growing markets in the region had “strikingly different pathways into crypto,” with each having differing use cases; however, remittances were a recurring theme.

India saw young adults use crypto to trade to boost their income, while a large number of Indians outside of the country used crypto for remittances. Vietnam also used crypto as “everyday infrastructure for remittances, gaming, and savings rather than speculation.”

Pakistan, meanwhile, has a “young, mobile-first population” that uses stablecoins as a hedge against inflation and for payments, while South Korea traded crypto “almost like equities” as new laws are “reshaping activity on major domestic exchanges,” Chainalysis said.

It added that the so-called “smaller markets” of Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong saw steps to align policy and regulatory regimes, aiming for greater and clearer oversight of the sector.

 The Ethereum co-founder warned that closed systems breed abuse and monopolies, urging open-source, verifiable infrastructure for healthcare, finance and voting. 

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin called for open-source, verifiable infrastructure across critical sectors, including healthcare, finance and governance, warning that centralized systems risk eroding trust and security.

In a Wednesday blog post, Buterin argued that as digital infrastructure becomes embedded in everyday life, relying on closed, opaque systems increases the danger of abuse and monopolization.

“The civilizations that gained the most from new waves of technology are not the ones who consumed the technology, but the ones who produced it,” Buterin wrote, adding that “openness and verifiability can fight against global balkanization.” 

Buterin said he envisions a world where verifiable devices form the backbone of global systems. “By default, we will likely get digital computer things that are built and run by centralized corporations,” he warned. “But we can try to steer toward a better alternative.”

Buterin said proprietary health tech can limit access, create data monopolies and expose users to surveillance risks. He pointed to the COVID-19 vaccine rollout as an example of how closed manufacturing and communication systems undermined public trust. In contrast, he praised initiatives like PopVax, which use open processes to reduce costs and skepticism.

The same concerns apply to finance. Buterin noted the sharp contrast between the five seconds it took him to sign a crypto transaction and the half-hour, $119 ordeal required to ship a signed legal form overseas. “Crypto wallets and blockchain-based systems already show how open, verifiable infrastructure can cut through inefficiency,” he said.

He also called for building secure, open hardware and software for critical public systems, especially voting. Drawing from decades of skepticism toward electronic voting machines, Buterin emphasized that proprietary “black box” software cannot deliver public trust.

Buterin has been a vocal advocate of privacy. In April, he said privacy must be a core design goal, arguing that blind faith in transparency and benevolent leadership is outdated.

Buterin also unveiled a privacy roadmap for Ethereum. In it, he highlighted the short-term changes to the base protocol and ecosystem needed to ensure better user privacy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Stressed koalas are facing a deadly epidemic","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250923021207.htm","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 02:43:49 GMT","

Australian researchers have revealed a clear relationship between stress and increased disease risk in koalas in South East Queensland and on the New South Wales North Coast.

A study led by Dr Michaela Blyton at The University of Queensland measured and tracked the level of koala retrovirus (KoRV) in groups of captive and wild koalas.

""We wanted to see what happened to their KoRV loads over time and how it related to chlamydial infection and levels of the stress hormones cortisol and corticosterone in their feces,"" Dr Blyton said.

""Virus load likely weakens the immune system, so those with a higher KoRV load are more at risk of diseases such as Chlamydia which can cause blindness, infertility and death.

""Poor quality or disappearing habitat may increase stress and the koalas with higher average cortisol levels had higher average KoRV loads.

""We have confirmed the biggest threats faced by koalas of habitat loss and disease are connected - this is very important to know to improve support for remaining koala populations.""

The 67 koalas in the study included wild koalas being treated for Chlamydia before being released, others in a Chlamydia vaccine trial and a small number of animals kept in captivity because of injury or ill health.

""Our study showed KoRV loads within individual animals were very stable over time,"" Dr Blyton said.

""Even when a koala with Chlamydia was successfully treated for that infection, their KoRV load did not decrease.

""That tells us the direction of causation is high KoRV load leading to an increased susceptibility to chlamydial infection and not the other way around.

""KoRV load could be underpinning the Chlamydia epidemic among koalas in northern New South Wales and South East Queensland.""

The study at UQ's School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences was supported by the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital, Currumbin Wildlife Hospital and funded by the NSW Government under the NSW Koala Strategy.

""When we're looking at koala conservation strategies, we need to be taking a holistic approach because disease and environmental factors are linked,"" Dr Blyton said.

""The best thing is to preserve good quality habitat and the populations of koalas it supports.

""We are involved in Koala Conservation Australia's breed to release program, where we are now screening and preferencing animals with low KoRV loads to hopefully give their offspring greater protection against Chlamydia and other infectious diseases.

""We are also aiming to investigate antiretrovirals to reduce KoRV loads in individuals to give them a better chance of fighting off Chlamydia and reducing transmission to the next generation.""

Protein design has focused on the design of ground states, ensuring that they are sufficiently low energy to be highly populated1. Designing the kinetics and dynamics of a system requires, in addition, the design of excited states that are traversed in transitions from one low-lying state to another2,3. This is a challenging task because such states must be sufficiently strained to be poorly populated, but not so strained that they are not populated at all, and because protein design methods have focused on generating near-ideal structures4,5,6,7. Here we describe a general approach for designing systems that use an induced-fit power stroke8 to generate a structurally frustrated9 and strained excited state, allosterically driving protein complex dissociation. X-ray crystallography, double electron–electron resonance spectroscopy and kinetic binding measurements show that incorporating excited states enables the design of effector-induced increases in dissociation rates as high as 5,700-fold. We highlight the power of this approach by designing rapid biosensors, kinetically controlled circuits and cytokine mimics that can be dissociated from their receptors within seconds, enabling dissection of the temporal dynamics of interleukin-2 signalling.

Protein–protein interactions orchestrate much of biological function. High-affinity interactions enable protein circuits to respond to low concentrations of stimuli and to act potently on targets; fast exchange enables them to respond quickly to changes in stimuli. These two properties cannot usually be achieved simultaneously in binary interactions because they depend on the interaction off-rate in opposite ways: high affinity usually requires slow dissociation (low off-rate), whereas rapid exchange requires fast dissociation (high off-rate) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Several natural systems exhibit ‘facilitated dissociation'10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20, in which an effector (E) can bind to a target–host (TH) complex to form an excited ternary complex (THE)20,21,22,23,24,25,26 from which the target dissociates quickly (Fig. 1a–c). In such a system, the target can bind tightly to the host, yet can also be rapidly released by adding the effector27. In engineered DNA systems, the kinetic control afforded by an analogous phenomenon (toehold-mediated strand displacement) has enabled the construction of many complex functions28,29, but DNA systems have limited utility for directly interfacing with biology. Protein binding and unbinding can be readily coupled to biological processes, but there has been no general approach to design kinetic control over protein interactions.

State X (transparent) is included to show the conformational change. Thinner arrows indicate structural features and thicker arrows indicate state changes.

We set out to design protein systems that undergo facilitated dissociation. Given an interacting protein binder–target pair, we reasoned that we could construct host proteins with controllable dissociation kinetics by fusing an effector-responsive conformational switch to the binder such that when the effector is not bound, the target can bind normally, but in the alternate effector-bound conformation, the switch clashes with the target, leading to strain in the target–host–effector ternary complex that resolves when the target dissociates30 (Fig. 1d,e; nomenclature detailed in Supplementary Note 1). This would allosterically couple the effector and target, and facilitated dissociation could proceed through the strained ternary complex intermediate faster than spontaneous dissociation of the target in mutually exclusive competition (Fig. 1c). Crucially, the energy of this ternary intermediate must be neither too high (otherwise the facilitated dissociation pathway would not be faster) nor too low (otherwise the target would not dissociate) (Fig. 1b). To set the ternary intermediate energy within this optimal range (Supplementary Fig. 2), we reasoned that we could control the level of strain in the ternary complex by varying the geometry of the switch–binder fusion. To access this strained state effectively, we reasoned that binding the effector should rapidly drive the conformational change against the resisting force associated with generating strain. Such a ‘driven' motion would be akin to the power strokes of motor proteins: a large conformational change that is both thermodynamically and kinetically favoured (a low-barrier descent down a steep energy gradient)8,31. Compared with the mechanism of direct steric overlap between target and effector, as in many existing facilitated dissociation systems17,18,19,20,26,32, this allosteric mechanism should be quite modular: such a force-generating switch could be fused to almost any binder to enable facilitated dissociation of its target.

We began by using a previously designed effector-responsive conformational switch (hinge protein cs221; ref. 33) to test the concept of allosteric coupling by switching steric clashes between the host and the target. This switch can undergo a rigid-body hinge motion to transition from a closed state (X) to an open state (Y), and in the open state Y can bind an effector peptide quite tightly (koff = 5 × 10−6 s−1). As a model binder–target interaction, we chose a designed heterodimer pair (LHD101 (ref. 34) modified as described in Supplementary Fig. 3) with dissociation slow enough (koff = 9 × 10−5 s−1) to allow us to easily measure substantial effector-induced acceleration of target dissociation, but not slower than the effector dissociation so that the target would be more likely than the effector to dissociate from the ternary complex. To allosterically couple binding of the effector to dissociation of the target, we designed structured fusions of the hinge switch and binder such that when the switch is in state X, the target can bind, but when in the effector-bound state Y, it will clash strongly (Fig. 1d,e, Supplementary Fig. 4a,b and Methods). We obtained synthetic genes encoding 12 designs, expressed and purified the proteins from Escherichia coli and found that the best (allosteric switch 0; AS0) showed slow and reduced effector association in the presence of the target (Supplementary Fig. 5d), indicating the desired allosteric coupling but also the need for designs with a faster, driven pathway for effector binding against the target.

In these first designs, because the effector-binding cleft is closed in state X, the hinge switch must first transition to the open state Y before the effector can bind (a conformational selection mechanism). Because state Y clashes with the target, this conformational change is slow when the target is bound, limiting the rate of effector association and the overall rate of facilitated dissociation (Supplementary Fig. 4c). This slow step could be bypassed if the effector could instead first bind to state X and accelerate the transition to state Y. An induced-fit mechanism could provide the driving force: an intrinsically disordered effector could weakly engage with state X, and fold and make more extensive interactions in the strained ternary complex in state Y35, driving the transition in a power-stroke-like motion36,37.

Such a mechanism would require new switches that, in state X and throughout the conformational transition, retain an open effector-binding cleft where a flexible effector could associate (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 4d). Starting from AS0, we constructed a new state X by shifting the two domains from their state Y positions relative to each other (by one heptad along the helix of domain 1 that contacts domain 2), building a new loop between the domains, and optimizing single sequences that could adopt both this new state X and the original effector-bound state Y (Supplementary Fig. 4e and Methods). This approach maintains the open cleft in state X by introducing minimal rotation from state Y and simplifies the multi-state sequence-design challenge by minimizing the local structural differences between the two states. Transition between conformational states occurs by a register shift throughout which the cleft could remain open and bind the effector (Supplementary Fig. 4f). Because these new hosts retain the state Y backbone validated to clash with the target in AS0, we should observe allosteric coupling if the switch works as designed (Fig. 1e).

We obtained synthetic genes encoding ten such designs, and found that four tightly bound the effector (dissociation constant (Kd) < 1 nM; Supplementary Fig. 6d). To measure facilitated dissociation kinetics, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR): with the target affixed to the SPR surface, we incubated with the host, then measured target–host dissociation under flow of various concentrations of effector. For these four designs, the target dissociates slowly in the absence of the effector; adding the effector increases the rate of dissociation markedly (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 7), but minimally affects the target off-rate from a control static binder fusion that lacks an effector-binding site (Supplementary Fig. 7).

To investigate the mechanism of facilitated dissociation (Fig. 2b), we focused on AS1, the design with the tightest effector binding (Kd,H:E ≈ 10 pM). We directly measured the rate constant of target dissociation from the strained ternary complex (koff,T:HE) by flowing pre-incubated host–effector complex at a high concentration to form the strained ternary complex with the target on the SPR surface, then tracking target–host dissociation under continued flow of the effector (Fig. 2e, Supplementary Fig. 7 and Methods). In the full facilitated dissociation process, as the concentration of added effector increases, the rate constant of facilitated target dissociation approaches koff,T:HE (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 7), strongly suggesting that the ternary complex is an intermediate in the facilitated dissociation process (Fig. 2b, lower pathways).

To further analyse the mechanism of forming the strained ternary complex, we characterized facilitated dissociation with two different effectors: the peptide and a three-helix bundle ‘3hb' (3hb21; ref. 33) (Fig. 2c). The two effectors make nearly identical interactions with AS1, but when unbound, the peptide is disordered whereas the 3hb is structured (Fig. 2d). With AS1 affixed to the SPR surface, we measured the rate of effector association to form the strained ternary complex by first saturating AS1 with target, then flowing varying concentrations of effector mixed with constant excess target (to ensure that the target remains bound after effector association). The apparent on-rate for binding to the target–AS1 complex increases linearly with concentration for the peptide (Fig. 2e) but hyperbolically for the 3hb, saturating at the rate of a concentration-independent step (Fig. 2f). Notably, with the 3hb, the rate of facilitated target dissociation saturates at this same value (Fig. 2h). The simplest explanation of these results is that the rigid 3hb can only bind to the fully open state Y of AS1 and that the THX → THY conformational change is slow (owing to partial blocking by the bound target), so it becomes rate limiting for both the association with the target–AS1 complex and the overall facilitated dissociation process (Fig. 2b, middle pathway). In contrast to the 3hb, peptide effector binding (Fig. 2e) and resulting target destabilization (Fig. 2g) can both occur more rapidly than the THX → THY conformational change, suggesting that the more flexible peptide effector can bind to AS1 in state X to accelerate this conformational change through an induced-fit mechanism12,35,38 (Fig. 2b, bottom pathway).

We used X-ray crystallography to structurally characterize multiple states of our designed systems. For both the AS1 and the AS5 systems, the crystal structures of the hosts alone (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 1a) and of the host–effector complexes (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 1b) closely match the design models (maximum 1.3 Å Cα root mean square deviation (RMSD)). The unbound structures show an open hydrophobic cleft in the new designed state X poised to bind the effector, and the effector-bound structures show that binding the effector causes the two switch domains to register-shift into the designed state Y (Supplementary Note 2). Structures of the target–AS1 complex show that the target binds as designed (Fig. 3c, top), with some strain suggested by small variations among the structures (Fig. 3c, bottom, Extended Data Fig. 1c,d and Supplementary Note 3).

The target–AS1 complex (pink and blue) hydrogen bonds (green) are less strained than the ternary complex (grey) hydrogen bonds (red).

We next sought to determine how the target–host–effector ternary complex deforms to resolve the designed clash. At the concentrations of the components used in the above experiments, the AS1 ternary complex is an only transiently populated excited state, but at high concentrations it becomes the dominant state (Kd,T:HE = 200 nM; Supplementary Fig. 9). This enabled us to solve structures of AS1 in the ternary complex intermediate with both target and effector. In structures from two different crystals, the switch region closely matches the state Y design model, and the rest of the structure strains to resolve the structural frustration from simultaneously binding the target and occupying state Y (Fig. 3d). This strain distributes across multiple locations in the structure: the binder fusion bends, the portion of the target that directly clashes with the switch becomes disordered and the target twists at its interface, disrupting the interfacial hydrophobic packing (Fig. 3e, top) and shearing the interfacial strand pairing (Fig. 3e, bottom). Double electron–electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy (Extended Data Fig. 2) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (Extended Data Fig. 3) suggest that the ternary complex is dynamic, with varying amounts of strain at each location (Supplementary Note 3).

We next investigated the factors that contribute to the dissociation kinetics, seeking to maximize the dissociation rate enhancement by (1) reducing the base rate of target dissociation and (2) increasing the rate of facilitated dissociation. For (1), the target dissociates 20-fold faster from AS1 than from an unhindered binder fusion (Supplementary Fig. 7), probably because of minor strain in the target–AS1 complex (Extended Data Fig. 1c). For (2), with AS1, effector association can occur at least five times faster than target dissociation from the ternary complex (Fig. 2e); thus, moderately increasing the energy of the ternary complex could accelerate the target dissociation step without making the effector association rate limiting, thereby increasing the overall rate of facilitated dissociation. Assuming a simple spring model of the ternary complex, this could be achieved by deforming with a greater magnitude or in a direction of higher stiffness (Supplementary Fig. 10a).

We sought to maximize strain energy in the ternary complex by modulating the magnitude and direction of the deformation required to resolve the designed clash (Fig. 4a). Avoiding any clash in state X while maintaining a strong clash in state Y, we sampled a variety of target + binder positions relative to the switch from AS1; rebuilt fusions between the switch and the newly located binder; and selected variants that were predicted by AlphaFold2 (AF2) to have substantial deformations spanning a variety of directions (AF2 predictions of the strained AS1 ternary complex were within 1.0 Å Cα RMSD of the target–AS1–effector crystal structure). These changes to the fusion region, although distant from both binding sites, caused considerable variation in the kinetics of target dissociation and their modulation by the effector (Supplementary Fig. 11). Most of these variants showed reduced target off-rates (compared with AS1) in the absence of effector that increased in the presence of effector (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Table 1), and for the fastest variant (AS117), adding effector accelerated target dissociation by 2,400-fold, reaching a rate exceeding that of the original AS1 (Fig. 4b). By comparing the predicted deformations with the facilitated dissociation rates in the forward and reverse directions (Supplementary Note 4), we found that the global strain energy of the ternary complex depends on both the magnitude and the direction of the deformation (Supplementary Fig. 10) and that strain can distribute non-uniformly throughout the structure, leading to kinetic asymmetry24 (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Extended Data Fig. 4).

We next set out to use facilitated dissociation to construct protein systems with kinetic behaviours that were previously inaccessible to design. First, inspired by toehold-mediated strand displacement in DNA28, we sought to create a kinetically trapped system which, on stimulation, quickly reconfigures through a chain reaction. To investigate this, we fused the effector peptide (E2) for a second reporter hinge (H2) to the target such that E2 is occluded when this fusion (E2–target) is bound to a host (Extended Data Fig. 5). As intended, the release of E2–target from AS114 and the subsequent switching of H2 is slow, but accelerates markedly upon addition of the original effector, which accelerates E2–target dissociation (we include excess original target to prevent E2–target rebinding39; Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 5). In principle, multiple orthogonal hosts could be constructed and chained together through such target–effector fusions.

Second, we reasoned that our designs could complement split protein systems with high affinity and enable them to be switched off rapidly. To test this, we tagged AS1 and the target with NanoBiT split luciferase fragments, LgBiT and SmBiT (ref. 40). When combined, these components exhibit high luciferase activity that disappears much more rapidly upon addition of effector and excess untagged target than upon addition of excess untagged target alone (Fig. 4d).

Third, in previously designed thermodynamically controlled biosensors that operate through a conformational selection mechanism, there is a trade-off between dynamic range and response time (reducing background by lowering the energy of the ‘off' state generally slows interconversion with the ‘on' state)41,42. We reasoned that sensors based on facilitated dissociation could be limited by the rate of target association rather than by internal conformational switching, and found that by caging the SmBiT peptide within the effector bound to a host, facilitated dissociation (in the reverse direction compared with previously) upon binding the target uncaged the SmBiT rapidly to enable luciferase reconstitution (Methods). Using this strategy together with a designed SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) binder (LCB1; ref. 43), we generated 16 ‘AScov' sensor designs in which the RBD clashes with the switch in state Y but not in state X. After addition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, the best sensor shows a 30-fold increase in luciferase activity, with a half-time of 30 s (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 6)—70 times faster than a previously designed LOCKR-based SARS-CoV-2 sensor that relies on conformational selection41. Thus, using this platform, a binder to almost any target can be turned into a single-component sensor that is sufficiently fast that, in most practical applications, its response time will be limited by target association rather than by a slow conformational change.

Finally, we investigated whether facilitated dissociation could be used to control cellular processes with high temporal resolution. In cellular signalling, the residence times of ligands on their cognate receptors is thought to modulate the signalling and cellular responses44,45,46. The central immune cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) activates the IL-2 receptor (IL-2Rβγc) by inducing heterodimerization of chains β and γc (ref. 47). The resulting complexes dissociate or degrade on timescales of hours48,49, so controlling the temporal dynamics of IL-2 signalling is difficult: there is no off-switch (Fig. 5a).

We set out to construct a switchable IL-2 mimic that enables control over the lifetime of the IL-2Rβγc complex with a time resolution of seconds (Fig. 5b). Neo2, a previously designed IL-2 mimic, tightly binds to IL-2Rβγc to elicit downstream signalling50. Sampling a variety of γc positions relative to the switch from AS1, we rigidly fused Neo2 to the switch such that in state X, γc can bind, but in the effector-bound state Y, it would strongly clash (Fig. 5c). We identified several designs for which binding the effector markedly accelerates the dissociation of γc from the active signalling complex (Supplementary Fig. 13). For one of these, ASNeo2, binding the effector induces a 1,500-fold increase in the γc off-rate (Fig. 5d). We designed variants of ASNeo2 with different dissociation kinetics and topological safeguards against degradation (Supplementary Note 5); for one, the effector accelerated γc dissociation by 5,700-fold, the highest fold change of all our designed systems (Extended Data Fig. 8).

To investigate the switching capability of ASNeo2 in a physiological context, we quantified the dimerization of labelled IL-2Rβ and γc in the plasma membrane of live cells by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. Dual-colour co-tracking and mobility analyses confirmed that ASNeo2 efficiently dimerizes IL-2Rβ and γc and that adding the effector reverses this association rapidly and completely, even at a high excess of γc (Fig. 5e,f, Extended Data Fig. 7c–i and Supplementary Video 1). By double labelling ASNeo2 on opposite sides, we could observe the effector-induced intramolecular conformational change at the plasma membrane using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) (Extended Data Fig. 7j,k). ASNeo2 activates signalling in human natural killer (NK) cells (YT-1 cell line), and its activity is greatly reduced in the presence of the effector (Fig. 5g). After the effector is added, STAT5 phosphorylation immediately stops accumulating and gradually decreases to a low level (Fig. 5h). The effector blocks ASNeo2 activity nearly as effectively as does ruxolitinib, a JAK1 inhibitor.

To examine how the duration of IL-2 signalling affects the downstream cellular response, we stimulated primary human T cells with ASNeo2 and induced dissociation at various time points. Whereas sustained stimulation was required for proliferation51 (Fig. 5i), protection from apoptosis was evident after a short transient stimulation: cells treated with ASNeo2 and then with effector 5 min afterwards survived three days later at double the rate of an unstimulated control (Fig. 5j), despite the suppression of most downstream IL-2 target proteins (Extended Data Fig. 9e). This likely reflects reduced caspase-3 activity and increased BCL2 expression after transient stimulation (Fig. 5k and Extended Data Fig. 9g).

To further investigate the dependence of IL-2 signalling on the lifetime of the signalling complexes, we compared RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from T cells that were treated with ASNeo2 transiently, continuously or not at all (Fig. 5l–n and Supplementary Fig. 14). Transient stimulation (through incubation with ASNeo2 followed by effector-induced dissociation) upregulated genes that are involved in suppressing apoptosis (BCL2, NIBAN2 and RNF157), cell-cycle regulation (CDKN2B, CDK6, CCND2 and PIM1), suppressing cytokine signalling (SOCS2 and CISH) and immune activation (TNFSF8, HAVCR2 and PTGER2) (Fig. 5m). On activation, T cells typically shift their energy production from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis52, and we observed that transient stimulation downregulates oxidative-phosphorylation genes (Fig. 5n and Supplementary Fig. 15; glycolysis genes are not yet upregulated). Sustained stimulation activated genes associated with mTORC-driven metabolic changes and MYC- and E2F-driven cell-cycle progression (for example, CDK4 and POLD2), but transient stimulation did not (Fig. 5n, Extended Data Fig. 9i and Supplementary Fig. 15), suggesting that IL-2 signalling must be sustained to pass the G1/S checkpoint. Transient stimulation did activate genes associated with formation of the mitotic spindle (for example, DOCK2 and KIF1B) (Fig. 5n, Extended Data Fig. 9i and Supplementary Fig. 15), suggesting that preparations for mitosis are made immediately after T cell activation, before cell-cycle checkpoints. These results show how designed facilitated dissociation can be used to tackle unanswered questions in cell biology.

We show here that by explicitly considering excited intermediate states when designing coupled protein systems, a broad range of facilitated dissociation systems can be designed. We use a switchable target binder (host) and a flexible effector that can rapidly bind to and switch the target–host complex to induce a large steric clash with the target, forming a strained excited ternary complex. By modulating the strain energy of the ternary complex, we can tune the resulting acceleration of target dissociation. Crystal structures throughout the facilitated dissociation process confirm our ability to design excited states and large register-shift conformational changes. Our designed dynamic systems show both a high dynamic range and a rapid stimulus response, demonstrating the kinetic advantage of facilitated dissociation over mutually exclusive competition.

Power-stroke mechanisms8,31 can generate force more efficiently than can ratchet mechanisms (in which a single large step is rectified at the end of the conformational change)37. Induced folding underlies the kinesin power stroke53, and our flexible effector likely also folds upon binding, accelerating the conformational transition by lowering the energy barrier: the energetic costs of uphill steps along the transition coordinate can be compensated by the formation of additional interactions with the folding peptide35,36,54. In contrast to this induced-fit mechanism of the flexible effector, we find that a rigid effector provides reduced rate acceleration even though it binds more tightly38. In kinesin and other biological systems, it is difficult to directly assess the role of flexibility and folding upon binding in overall function; by contrast, our designed model systems allow the direct comparison of flexible and rigid effectors and show that the former yield faster conformational transitions against loads.

Most known examples of facilitated dissociation couple the target and the effector through a combination of direct steric overlap17,18,19,20,26,32 and intricate allostery14,15,22,23,24,25. By contrast, because our allosteric mechanism of switching steric clashes places no specific requirements on the binder or target, our approach can be used to dynamically regulate protein–protein interactions quite generally: by fusing to our switch, almost any binding interaction can be made to switch off rapidly in the presence of an effector. Our approach transferred immediately to rapidly switching active IL-2-like signalling complexes: we obtained several working designs on the first attempt (in which 24 designs were tested). Controlling the duration of IL-2 signalling with such switchable cytokines could enable investigation of early events in signalling or tuning of the cell response through timing-sensitive regulatory mechanisms further downstream51 (for example, disrupting signalling complexes at the cell surface or later in the endosome49 could be used to distinguish the cellular responses induced by signalling from each compartment55). Therapeutically, systemic administration of the effector and local administration of the switchable cytokine could elicit strong immune activation at only the site of administration (because any cytokine that escapes into circulation would be deactivated by the effector). More generally, our work provides a route to designing the rates and pathways of protein motion and change, which should ultimately enable the construction of complex, lifelike protein machinery.

In PyMOL, we manually positioned the switch relative to the binder–target complex subject to several constraints: there is no steric overlap between the target and switch state X; there is large steric overlap between the target and switch state Y; the smallest deformation that could be undergone by the switch and the target to resolve this clash is in the desired direction; and the switch C terminus and binder N terminus are relatively oriented such that sensible additional structure could be built between the switch and the binder to rigidly fuse them as positioned. To aid in visualizing this additional structure, we also included placeholder helices while manually positioning the switch and binder, effectively ‘sketching' the fusion (Supplementary Fig. 4b).

We then refined these sketches into plausible backbones. For the initial fusions including AS0, we extracted the centre four residues of the placeholder helix, then used inpainting with RosettaFold56 to scaffold that fragment between the switch and the binder. For later fusions, including the AS1 variants and ASNeo2 designs, we first used Rosetta FastDesign57 to sample around the starting sketch for designable positions of the switch, binder and placeholder helices while keeping the region of the state X switch that clashes in state Y fixed relative to the target, then used RFDiffusion7 (conditioned on the secondary structure and block adjacency of the sketches) to build structure between the sampled switch and binder positions. During both structure-generation approaches, we masked noncritical residues on the switch and binder interfacing with the fusion structure. After generation of the fusion backbone structure, we used ProteinMPNN58 to optimize sequences for the fusion structure and the masked residues on the switch and binder. To filter designs, we used AF259 (with initial guess (AF2-IG)60 for complex predictions) to predict the structure of the fusions alone, with the target, and with the effector, selecting designs for which each structural state is correctly and confidently predicted by a majority of the five model weight sets. Finally, for the AS1 variants and ASNeo2 designs, we used AF2-IG to predict the structure of the strained ternary complexes, selecting sets with a diversity of deformation directions.

Designs AS1, AS2, AS5 and AS7 were generated starting from design AS0, which contains the hinge switch cs221. When cs221 was designed, its state Y was generated by copying the N-terminal domain (helices 1–4) of its parent scaffold (DHR20; ref. 61), aligning helix 4 of the copy to the corresponding helix of DHR20 offset by three residues, and combining the transformed N-terminal domain and original C-terminal domain into a single protein33. Thus, relative to the C-terminal domain, the N-terminal domain is both rotated around and translated along the axis of helix 4, exposing a cleft between the domains for binding a helical peptide. Now, to generate a new state X for this switch that retains an open cleft, we repeated this procedure but aligned the N-terminal domain with a residue offset of −4 instead of 3, so that overall this position of the N-terminal domain is shifted from state Y along helix 4 by one heptad (Supplementary Fig. 4e). This introduces minimal rotation and thus maintains the open cleft. We combined this new position of the N-terminal domain with the entire C-terminal domain of AS0 (including the fusion to LHD101B), then used Rosetta FastDesign to further sample designable positions of the N-terminal domain around this starting point. In half of the design trajectories, we included a placeholder helix in the cleft to help ensure it remains open. We then used inpainting with RosettaFold to generate loops connecting the domains, then paired these complete state X backbones with the original effector-bound state Y of AS0 (also generating new loops between domains in state Y as necessary to match the loop lengths of each new state X).

To generate single sequences that support both states, we first performed multi-state design with Rosetta FastDesign (enforcing sequence symmetry between states) to further refine the paired backbones so that they are more mutually compatible, then used ProteinMPNN with residue probabilities tied at corresponding positions between states to optimize sequences simultaneously for both conformations33. During these sequence-design steps, the sequence of the effector and of the binder fusion was kept fixed. To filter designs, we used AF2-IG to predict the structure of the switches both with and without the effector, selecting designs for which the new state X (in the absence of effector) and state Y (in the presence of effector) are correctly and confidently predicted by a majority of the five model weight sets. To further ensure that these designs favour state X in the absence of effector and state Y in the presence of effector, we only selected designs that scored more favourably in Rosetta in state X than in state Y, but also scored more favourably in state Y with the effector bound than the sum of the scores of state X and the unbound effector.

We first sought to cage the SmBiT peptide within the effector so that, through reverse facilitated dissociation, binding of the target would rapidly uncage the SmBiT to enable luciferase reconstitution. We grafted SmBiT onto the effector peptide at a range of positions, then screened these ‘SmBiTgraft' variants for binding to AS0 and rapid dissociation after binding of the target. We used AS0 as the base design, reasoning that its closed state X would slow undesired peptide reassociation. For each working SmBiTgraft, we then generated a flexibly linked LgBiT–SmBiTgraft–AS0 construct. The best construct shows low luciferase activity that increases rapidly after addition of target, but only slowly after addition of effector peptide (which must compete directly with SmBiTgraft) (Extended Data Fig. 6). To demonstrate the modularity of this platform, using the methods described above for designing hosts, we rigidly fused a SARS-CoV-2 RBD binder (LCB1; ref. 43) to the switch in place of the target binder such that the RBD clashes with the switch in state Y but not in state X, and tested 16 of these AScov fusion designs.

Synthetic DNA fragments encoding each design were obtained from IDT as eBlocks and cloned into custom vectors using Golden Gate assembly62. Designs usually contained a C-terminal sequence-specific nickel-assisted cleavage (SNAC) tag63 and a 6×His tag (MSG-Protein-GSGSHHWGSTHHHHHH). Proteins to be captured on the chip for SPR experiments contained an N-terminal AviTag and a C-terminal 6×His tag (MSGLNDIFEAQKIEWHESSG-Protein-GSGHHHHHH). For the size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) binding experiments shown in Supplementary Fig. 6 and for screening SmBiTgraft effector peptide variants with SPR, the effector was fused to superfolder GFP in a sfGFP-GSSG-Effector-GSHHHHHH construct. To rapidly break split luciferases, AS1 was fused to LgBiT in a MSG-AS1-linker-LgBiT-GSHHHHHH construct and the target was fused to SmBiT in a MSG-Target-linker-SmBiT-GSHHHHHH construct. In the rapid sensors, AS0 and AScov were fused to LgBiT and a SmBiT-containing effector in a MSGHHHHHHGS-LgBiT-linker-SmBiTgraft-linker-(AS0 or AScov)-GS construct. Sequences for all designs are available in Supplementary Table 4.

All proteins were expressed from NEB BL21(DE3) E. coli cells using TBII (MpBio) autoinduction medium with 0.5% (w/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) glucose, 0.2% (w/v) lactose, 20 mM MgSO4, trace metal mix and 50 μg ml−1 kanamycin. Expression cultures (50 ml) were grown either at 37 °C for 16–20 h or at 37 °C for 6–8 h, then at 18 °C for 16–20 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 5 ml lysis buffer (100 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 Pierce Protease Inhibitor Mini Tablets, EDTA-free per 50 ml) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000g for 30 min. Protein in the soluble lysate was bound to 1 ml Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN), washed with 5 ml low-salt wash buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 50 mM imidazole), 5 ml high-salt wash buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl, 50 mM imidazole) and 5 ml low-salt wash buffer, and eluted in 1.2 ml elution buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 500 mM imidazole) after a 0.4 ml pre-elution. The proteins were further purified by SEC on a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system with a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl) with 1-ml fractions. Where possible, fractions that probably corresponded to protein monomers were selected. Final protein concentrations were estimated using molar extinction coefficients predicted from the protein sequence and integrating the absorbance at 280 nm over the selected fractions. Correct protein molecular weights were confirmed using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS).

The effector peptide cs221B was chemically synthesized by GenScript. The TAMRA-labelled effector used in fluorescence polarization (FP) experiments was synthesized as previously described33.

Individual host proteins, sfGFP–effector and 1:1 host:sfGFP–effector mixtures were prepared at 20 μM in TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl). A 0.5-ml quantity of each solution was injected onto a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column in TBS and the absorbance at 230 nm was monitored for changes in the retention volumes of the mixture compared with the individual proteins.

FP binding experiments with TAMRA-labelled effector were performed at 25 °C in TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl) with 0.05% v/v TWEEN20 in 96-well plates (Corning 3686). Parallel and perpendicular fluorescence intensity was measured using a Synergy Neo2 plate reader with an FP 530/590 filter cube. Fluorescence polarization P (in units of mP) was calculated by the following expression:

For affinity measurements, host proteins were titrated by twofold serial dilution across TAMRA–effector (at a constant concentration between 0.1 and 1 nM) through 24 wells, with a final volume of 80 μl in each well. Plates were incubated for at least 12 h at room temperature to fully equilibrate before measurement. To determine affinities, the following binding isotherm function was fitted to the measured polarization values using nonlinear least-squares minimization:

where P is the modelled polarization, P0 is the polarization of free effector, P1 is the change in polarization after binding the host, fbound is the fraction of effector bound to the host, [H] and [E] are the total concentrations of host and effector, respectively, and Kd is the affinity between the host and the effector. When the fit Kd is lower than [E], affinities are too strong to be accurately measured with this method, so ‘Kd < [E]' is reported.

For kinetic competition measurements, the target LHD101An1 was titrated by twofold serial dilution across the host protein (at a constant concentration of 22 nM) through five wells (a sixth well with just the host was also included) with a final volume of 72 μl in each well. Plates were incubated for one hour to allow the host and the target to equilibrate. To each well, 8 μl of 200 nM TAMRA–effector was added and rapidly mixed using a multichannel pipette, and the measurement was started immediately afterwards. This resulted in a 20 nM final concentration of both host and effector in a final volume of 80 μl per well. The following single exponential decay function was fitted to the measured polarization time courses using nonlinear least-squares minimization:

where P is the modelled polarization, P0 is the polarization of free effector, P1 is the amplitude of the change in polarization, kapp is the apparent rate constant and t is the time after the start of the measurement.

To measure facilitated dissociation in the reverse direction, host and TAMRA–effector were incubated at a 2:1 ratio to fully saturate the effector with host, diluted to 4 nM host and 2 nM effector, and distributed across 11 wells (40 μl in each well). In nine separate wells, the target was titrated by a fourfold serial dilution with constant excess unlabelled effector (40 μM). Just excess unlabelled effector at 40 μM was prepared in the 10th separate well (to measure the base rate of effector dissociation), and buffer was prepared in the 11th (to confirm the baseline remains stable). Forty microlitres of these target + effector solutions were added to the 11 host + TAMRA–effector wells and rapidly mixed using a multichannel pipette, and the measurement was started immediately afterwards. This resulted in final concentrations of 2 nM host, 1 nM TAMRA–effector, 20 μM unlabelled effector (to make the dissociation of TAMRA–effector irreversible) and varying concentrations of target in a final volume of 80 μl per well. The following single exponential decay function was fitted to the measured polarization time courses using nonlinear least-squares minimization:

The following hyperbolic function was fitted to the apparent rate constants kapp:

where koff,H:E is the base effector off-rate constant, koff,TH:E is the off-rate constant for accelerated effector dissociation from the ternary complex, K1/2 is the concentration at which half the rate increase from koff,H:E to koff,TH:E is reached and [T] is the concentration of target present.

Proteins to be captured on the SPR chip were expressed with an N-terminal AviTag and purified as described above, except that the proteins were biotinylated after elution from the Ni-NTA resin: to the elutions, 5 μg ml−1 BirA (Avidity), 10 mM ATP, 10 mM Mg(OAc)2 and 100 μM d-biotin were added and allowed to incubate at room temperature for at least 4 h before further purification by SEC. Successful biotinylation was confirmed using LC–MS. SPR measurements were performed at 25 °C in HBS-EP+ buffer (Cytiva) on a Biacore 8K instrument. Biotinylated proteins were immobilized on the chip using the Biotin CAPture system (Cytiva).

For measurements of target off-rate constants, biotinylated target protein was immobilized on the chip. To measure base off-rate constants koff,T:H, host proteins at 50 nM were flowed over the chip for 60 s, then dissociation was measured for 2 h. To measure accelerated off-rate constants koff,T:HE, pre-incubated host–effector complexes (host at 1 μM and effector at 5 μM to ensure that the host is saturated with effector) were flowed for 60 s to form the ternary complex on the chip, then dissociation was measured for 4–20 min under a constant flow of 5 μM effector. Most dissociation data were fitted with the following double exponential decay function to account for populations of host protein with different dissociation kinetics:

where S is the modelled SPR response, S0 is the baseline, S1 and S2 are amplitudes relating to the sizes of each host population, kapp,1 and kapp,2 are apparent rate constants corresponding to each host population, t is the time and t0 is the time at which dissociation initiates. The reported rate constant typically corresponds to the faster and higher amplitude exponential in the fit; instances in which other criteria are used to determine which rate constant corresponds to the change of interest are noted. When clearly only one host population is present (often indicated by kapp,1 ≈ kapp,2 or a large difference between S1 and S2 when fitting a double exponential), the following single exponential decay function was fitted instead, in which the parameters are the same as above (instances in which single exponentials were used are noted):

To measure the rate constant of effector association to form the ternary complex, biotinylated host protein was immobilized on the chip. The host protein was saturated with target by flowing 5 μM target over the chip for 4 min, then a varying concentration of effector and 5 μM target was flowed over the chip for 2–4 min to associate the effector, and finally 5 μM target was flowed over the chip for 4 min to monitor effector dissociation. Target was included at 5 μM (higher than its affinity to the ternary complex) throughout the experiment to ensure that the host remained saturated with target, preventing changes in target binding from convoluting the response from effector binding. Association data were fitted with the following single exponential decay function:

where S is the modelled SPR response, S0 is the baseline, S1 is the amplitude, kapp is the apparent rate constant, t is the time and t0 is the time at which dissociation initiates.

With the peptide effector, the following linear function was fitted to the apparent rate constants:

where kon,TH:E and koff,TH:E are on-rate and off-rate constants and [E] is the concentration of effector flowed over the chip.

With the 3hb effector, the following hyperbolic function was fitted to the apparent rate constants:

where kswitch is the rate constant for the THX → THY conformational change, kunswitch is the rate constant for the THY → THX conformational change, kon,TH:E and koff,TH:E are on-rate and off-rate constants and [E] is the concentration of effector flowed over the chip. This function describes the slow relaxation rate constant of binding by conformational selection64. The data can be fitted with only the slow relaxation because, as the conformational pre-equilibrium favours state X (that is, kswitch « kunswitch), the effect of the fast relaxation on kapp is minimal. During the fit, koff,TH:E was constrained to a low value (<1 × 10−4 s−1), as observed.

To measure the effector-concentration-dependent rate constant of the full facilitated dissociation process, either biotinylated target protein or biotinylated common gamma γc ectodomain (Acro Biosystems ILG-H85E8) was immobilized on the chip. For experiments with ASNeo2 designs, the ASNeo2 hosts were pre-incubated with IL-2Rβ ectodomain (Acro Biosystems CD2-H5221) before association with γc. Each experiment involved multiple cycles of host association and induced dissociation under the flow of various concentrations of effector obtained by twofold serial dilution (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Throughout these cycles, a small population of host that is unresponsive to the effector (‘Hn', owing to partial degradation or misfolding induced by the strain in the ternary complex) could accumulate on the chip (Supplementary Fig. 8a,b). The following system of differential equations describing the expected behaviour of the proteins on the chip (accounting for this accumulation) can be fitted to the dissociation curve of cycle n (Supplementary Fig. 8c):

with initial values computed for each cycle by

and the modelled concentrations of each complex state on the chip is related to the SPR response by

where S is the modelled SPR response, [THE], [TH] and [THn] are concentrations of complex states on the chip, t is the time after the start of the dissociation cycle, [E] is the concentration of effector flowed over the chip, koff,T:H, koff,T:HE, kon,TH:E, koff,TH:E and koff,T:Hn are on-rate and off-rate constants, aTH, aTHE and aTHn are amplitudes relating the concentration of each state on the chip to an SPR response, fn is an amplitude fudge factor for cycle n accounting for small differences in amplitude across cycles and fresponsive is the fraction of host that is responsive to the effector. Varying all of these parameters, this model is then globally fitted to the dissociation curves of all cycles using nonlinear least-squares minimization. Note that with a sufficiently high value of kon,TH:E, this model's dissociation kinetics are determined mainly by the target dissociation parameters koff,T:H and koff,T:HE; meanwhile, the effector binding parameters kon,TH:E and koff,TH:E tend to tightly covary and cannot be accurately determined from these fits. Also note that for designs with low values for koff,T:HE, this model may be less accurate because the assumption that [THE] = 0 at the beginning of each cycle may no longer be valid. To compute the effective rate constant of the full facilitated dissociation process for intact host, we used the following simplified system of differential equations, which no longer accounts for a small population of unresponsive host:

For each effector concentration [E], this system was solved for the half-time of the target:host interaction t1/2 using the rate parameters determined from the original model fitted to the data, and the effective rate constant of the full dissociation process keff was computed from each half-time as follows:

The following hyperbolic function was fitted to the effective rate constants (constrained to the values of koff,T:HE and koff,T:H obtained from the global fit):

where koff,T:H is the base target off-rate constant, koff,T:HE is the off-rate constant for accelerated target dissociation from the ternary complex, K1/2 is the concentration at which half the rate increase from koff,T:H to koff,T:HE is reached and [E] is the concentration of effector flowed over the chip.

The discrepancy in the 3hb EC50 between the 3hb association experiment in Fig. 2f (right) and the target facilitated dissociation experiment in Fig. 2h (right) could result from the fusion tag that was used to fix AS1 to the surface competing with the 3hb for binding the cleft, reducing the apparent 3hb on-rate in the 3hb association experiment but not in the target facilitated dissociation experiment.

All SPR measurements in the main figures were repeated at least once, with similar results.

Circular dichroism spectra were measured at 25 °C on protein samples at 0.2 mg ml−1 in TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl) using a Jasco J-1500 spectrophotometer.

The AS1 TH and THE complexes required increased hydrophobicity to crystallize. This was accomplished by lysine methylation (for crystals AS1_TH 1, AS1_TH 2 and AS1_THE 1) or with the hydrophobic surface mutations K46L, E50W, K172W and E173Y (for crystal AS1_THE 2).

Protein was expressed from NEB BL21(DE3) E. coli cells using TBII autoinduction medium as above but at a larger scale: either 8 × 50 ml or 1–2 × 500 ml cultures. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer and lysed by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000g for 30 min. Protein in the soluble lysate was bound to 8 ml Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN), washed with 10 ml low-salt wash buffer, 30 ml high-salt wash buffer and 10 ml SNAC cleavage buffer (100 mM 2-(N-cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid (CHES), 100 mM acetone oxime, 100 mM NaCl and 500 mM guanidinium chloride, pH 8.6)63 and incubated in 40 ml SNAC cleavage buffer + 2 nM NiCl2 for 12 h at room temperature to cleave. Afterwards, the flowthrough was collected and the beads were washed with 40 ml lysis buffer (minus the protease inhibitors). The amount of cleaved protein in the flowthrough and wash was assessed with SDS–PAGE, and fractions with enough cleaved protein were concentrated and further purified using SEC on an FPLC system with either a Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 GL column or a HiLoad 20/600 Superdex 75 pg column in either TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl) or lysine methylation buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 250 mM NaCl) if lysine residues in the protein were to be methylated. For protein complex cocrystallization, the purified proteins and/or chemically synthesized effector were mixed at equimolar ratios. For some samples (resulting in crystals AS1_TH 1, AS1_TH 2 and AS1_THE 1), lysine residues were methylated as previously described65, and the reaction was quenched using SEC on an FPLC system to buffer-exchange into TBS. Finally, the samples were concentrated to crystallization levels.

Crystallization experiments were done using the sitting drop vapour diffusion method. Initial crystallization trials were set up in 200-nl drops using the 96-well plate format at 20 °C. Crystallization plates were set up using a Mosquito LCP from SPT Labtech, then imaged using UVEX microscopes and UVEX PS-256 from JAN Scientific. Diffraction-quality crystals formed in 0.2 M magnesium chloride hexahydrate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate pH 6.5 and 50% v/v PEG 200 for AS1_H; in 0.2 M sodium chloride, 0.1 M Na/K phosphate pH 6.2 and 50% v/v PEG 200 for CS221B; in 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.0, 5% w/v γ-PGA (Na+ form, LM) and 30% v/v PEG 400 for LHD101An1; in 0.2 M magnesium chloride hexahydrate, 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5 and 25% w/v polyethylene glycol 3,350 for AS5_HE; in 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.0 and 20% (v/v) MPD for AS5_H; in 0.2 M 1,6-hexanediol, 0.2 M 1-butanol, 0.2 M 1,2-propanediol, 0.2 M 2-propanol, 0.2 M 1,4-butanediol, 0.2 M 1,3-propanediol, sodium HEPES, MOPS (acid) pH 7.5, 40% v/v PEG 500 MME and 20% w/v PEG 20000 for AS1_HE; in 0.1 M citric acid pH 3.5 and 2.0 M ammonium sulfate for AS1_THE 1; in 1.0 M lithium chloride, 0.1 M citrate pH 4.0 and 20% w/v PEG 6000 for AS1_THE 2; in 2.4 M sodium malonate pH 7.0 for AS1_TH 1 (P 61 2 2); and in 1.8 M ammonium citrate tribasic pH 7.0 for AS1_TH 2 (P 21 21 21).

Diffraction data were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source II beamline 17-ID-1 (FMX/AMX), the Advanced Light Source beamline 821/822 or the Advanced Photon Source NECAT 24ID-C. X-ray intensities and data reduction were evaluated and integrated using XDS66 and merged and scaled using Pointless or Aimless in the CCP4 program suite67. Structure determination and refinement starting phases were obtained by molecular replacement with Phaser68, using the designed model for the structures. After molecular replacement, the models were improved using phenix.autobuild with rebuild-in-place to false and using simulated annealing. Structures were refined in PHENIX69. Model building was performed using Coot70. The final model was evaluated using MolProbity71. Data collection and refinement statistics are provided in Extended Data Tables 1–3.

Spin-label modelling and distance distribution predictions were performed as previously described33 using chiLife72 with the off-rotamer sampling method73. Site pair selections were performed as previously described33. Host protein variants containing cysteine residues at the selected sites were purified as described above, except that 0.5 mM TCEP was included in the lysis buffer and the first two Ni-NTA resin washes, and the proteins were labelled immediately after elution from the Ni-NTA resin: to the elutions, 50 μl of 200 mM of the nitroxide spin label 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSL) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added and allowed to incubate for at least 2 h at room temperature before further purification by SEC. Successful labelling was confirmed using LC–MS. DEER samples were prepared at 20 µM labelled host protein in deuterated solvent buffered by 20 mM Tris at pH 8.0 with 100 mM NaCl and 20% d8-glycerol (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as a glassing agent. When appropriate, target and effector were added to a concentration of 100 µM each. Then, 15–30 µl of each sample was loaded into a quartz capillary (Sutter Instrument, 1.1 mm inner diameter, 1.5 mm outer diameter) and flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at −80 °C until the DEER experiments were performed.

DEER experiments were performed as previously described33. An ELEXSYS E580 spectrometer (Bruker) at Q-band (around 34 GHz) with an EN5107D2 resonator (Bruker) was used for all experiments. The temperature was maintained at 50 K using a cryogen-free cooling system (ColdEdge). The four-pulse DEER sequence was used, using 60-ns Gaussian observer pulses with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 30 ns and a frequency near the centre of the field-swept spectrum and 150-ns sech/tanh probe pulses with centre 80 MHz above the observer frequency, 80 MHz bandwidth and a truncation parameter of 10. All shaped pulses were generated using the SpinJet arbitrary waveform generator (Bruker). Pulse shapes were calculated using PulseShape (https://github.com/stolllab/PulseShape), using both resonator compensation and transmitter nonlinearity compensation. All data were collected using a 2 ms shot repetition time, 8-step phase cycling and τ1 averaging from 400 ns to 528 ns in 16-ns steps. All other experimental parameters (including pump pulse time step, τ2 delays, number of scans and others) were chosen on a per-sample basis and are reported in Supplementary Table 3.

All DEER data were analysed using the DeerExp module of the eprTools Python package (https://github.com/mtessmer/eprTools). All data were fitted using separable nonlinear least squares74. The foreground signal was modelled using Tikhonov regularization with the second derivative operator. The regularization parameter was selected using generalized cross-validation. The background was modelled using a 3D-homogeneous spin distribution. An additional penalty restraining the modulation depth to be low was used to prevent the fitting of long-distance artefacts in the foreground, as was done previously75. Confidence intervals were estimated using bootstrap sampling with 100 samples using a fixed regularization parameter. Fit parameters such as the regularization parameter, the modulation depth and the signal-to-noise ratio are listed in Supplementary Table 3.

Input files for the MD simulation were prepared with CHARMM-GUI76,77, with AF2 structure as the initial structure. A rectangular water box of edge length 10 Å was placed around the protein. The water box contained potassium and chlorine ions of concentration 0.15 M that neutralized the protein's net charge. The ions were placed in the water box using the Monte Carlo method. To model the system, the CHARMM36m force field78 was used. After the explicit solvent system was made, the system was minimized and equilibrated before the production MD run. All three steps were performed with the GROMACS 2020.2 MD engine79,80.

The steepest descent method was used for energy minimization, for 5,000 steps with an energy tolerance of 1000 kJ mol−1 nm−1. The neighbour list was updated every ten steps with a cut-off distance of 1.2 nm. Cut-off was used to calculate Van der Waals interactions with a switch distance of 1.0 nm and a cut-off distance of 1.2 nm. The force was smoothly switched off between the switch distance and the cut-off distance. The fast smooth particle-mesh Ewald method was used to calculate electrostatics with a cut-off distance of 1.0 nm. All bonds with hydrogen atoms were treated as rigid using the linear constraint solver (LINCS) algorithm81.

The equilibration step was performed with a leap-frog algorithm using a time step of 1 fs and a total simulation time of 125 ps. The system was propagated in the NVT ensemble. The temperature was maintained at 303.15 K using the velocity rescaling method. The solute and solvent were coupled with a time constant for coupling of 1 ps. The centre-of-mass translational velocity was removed every 100 steps to prevent the system from drifting. The cut-off schemes for Van der Waals and electrostatic interactions were the same as those used in the minimization step, except that the neighbour list was updated every 20 steps. The velocities were generated from a Maxwell distribution with a temperature of 303.15 K. The same LINCS method was used to constrain the hydrogen atoms during the equilibration step.

The production step was performed with a leap-frog algorithm using a time step of 2 fs and a total simulation time of 1 μs. The trajectories with the same initial equilibrated structure were obtained in triplicate. The system was propagated in the NPT ensemble. The temperature was maintained at 303.15 K using the velocity rescaling method. The solute and solvent were coupled with a time constant of 1 ps. Exponential relaxation pressure coupling and isotropic coupling with a time constant of 5.0 ps was used to maintain the pressure at 1.0 bar. The cut-off schemes for Van der Waals and electrostatic interactions were the same as those used in the minimization step, except that the neighbour list was updated every 20 steps and the Coulomb cut-off distance was set as 1.2 nm. The centre-of-mass velocity removal was the same as that used in the equilibration step. The same LINCS method was used to constrain the hydrogen atoms during the production step.

Analysis of the trajectories, such as RMSD and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) calculations, was performed with MDAnalysis82. To simulate DEER distance distributions from these trajectories, structures along each trajectory were clustered using the Gromos clustering algorithm83 in GROMACS, distance distributions were predicted (using chiLife72 with the off-rotamer sampling method73) for the centre structure of each cluster and the resulting distributions were averaged weighted by the occupancies of their corresponding clusters.

Hinge protein cs201F_E249L (H2) was purified as described above, except that 0.5 mM TCEP was included in the lysis, wash and elution buffers, and the SEC buffer was phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl and 0.5 mM TCEP). To double label with dyes, 50 μM H2 was incubated with 250 μM Alexa Fluor 555 C2 maleimide (donor; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 250 μM Alexa Fluor 647 C2 maleimide (acceptor; Thermo Fisher Scientific), shaking at room temperature for at least 2 h. The reaction was quenched by adding DTT to 10 mM, and the proteins were separated from excess dye by SEC in TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl).

FRET binding experiments were performed at 25 °C in TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl) with 0.05% v/v TWEEN20 in 96-well plates (Corning 3686). Fluorescence intensity was measured using a Synergy Neo2 plate reader, exciting the donor at a 520-nm wavelength and reading acceptor emission at a 665-nm wavelength.

To measure the E2–target on-rate constant, 40 μl H2 at 10 nM was prepared in six wells. To each well, 40 μl E2–target at various concentrations was added and rapidly mixed using a multichannel pipette, and the measurement was started immediately afterwards. The following single exponential decay function was fitted to the measured FRET time courses using nonlinear least-squares minimization,

where S is the modelled fluorescence signal, S0 is the fluorescence at equilibrium, S1 is the amplitude of the change in fluorescence, kapp is the apparent rate constant and t is the time after the start of the measurement. The following linear function was fitted to the apparent rate constants:

where kon and koff are on-rate and off-rate constants and [E2] is the total concentration of E2–target.

To measure the accelerated transfer of E2 from AS114 to H2, 1,067 nM AS114 and 533 nM E2–target were incubated for 15 min to fully cage E2–target in AS114. A control solution of just 1,067 nM AS114 was also prepared. A 37.5-μl quantity of 42.7 nM H2 was prepared in eight wells; 37.5 μl of AS114 + E2–target was added to four wells and 37.5 μl of AS114 was added to the other four wells using a multichannel pipette, and the measurement was started immediately afterwards. Five minutes later, four solutions (5 μl buffer, 100 μM target, 16 μM effector or 100 μM target + 16 μM effector) were added to each set of four wells (each solution to a different well of each set) using a multichannel pipette, and the measurement was immediately continued for 1 h. Mixing components at these concentrations resulted in final concentrations of 500 nM AS114, 250 nM E2–target, 20 nM H2, 1 μM effector and 6 μM target. A baseline drift function of the following form was fitted to the AS114 + buffer data and subtracted from the other time courses:

where S is the modelled fluorescence signal, S0 is the fluorescence at equilibrium, S1 is the amplitude of the change in fluorescence, k is a rate constant, t is the time after the start of the measurement and t1/2 is the time at which the fluorescence has changed by half the full amplitude. AS114 was used because, in state X, it does not clash with E2 extending past the target in E2–target.

Luminescence experiments were performed at 25 °C in TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl) with 0.05% v/v TWEEN20 in 96-well plates (Corning 3686). Luminescence was measured using a Synergy Neo2 plate reader with a LUM filter cube.

To measure rapid breakage of a split luciferase, 111 pM AS1–LgBiT and 22 nM target SmBiT were incubated for one hour to load AS1 with the target and reconstitute the split luciferase. Next, 72 μl of this mixture was added to two wells, then 8 μl of 1/10-diluted Nano-Glo substrate (Promega N1130) and either 10 μM effector and 200 μM target or just 200 μM target was added to these wells using a multichannel pipette, and the measurement was started immediately afterwards. Excess target was included to fully outcompete target–SmBiT to enable measurement of the dissociation rate. Mixing components at these concentrations resulted in final concentrations of 100 pM AS1–LgBiT, 20 nM target–SmBiT, 1 μM effector, 20 μM target and 1/100-diluted Nano-Glo substrate.

To measure rapid analyte sensing, 64 μl of 12.5-pM sensor was added to eight wells, 8 μl of 1/10-diluted Nano-Glo substrate was added to these wells using a multichannel pipette and the measurement was started immediately afterwards. Five minutes later, 8 μl of various concentrations of analyte obtained by tenfold serial dilution was added using a multichannel pipette, and the measurement was immediately continued for 30–60 min. Mixing components at these concentrations resulted in final concentrations of 10 pM sensor and 1/100-diluted Nano-Glo substrate. The analytes were target, effector or SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Acro Biosystems SPD-C52H3). Figure 4e shows a time course with 800 nM SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

For cell-surface labelling, receptors were N-terminally fused to suitable tags using a pSems vector including the signal sequence of Igκ (pSems leader). Common gamma chain (γc) was fused to the ALFA-tag84 and IL-2Rβ was fused to nonfluorescent monomeric GFP (mXFP)85. HeLa cells (ACC 57, DSMZ) were cultured as previously described86. For transient transfection, cells were incubated for 4–6 h with a mixture of 150 mM NaCl, 10 µl of 1 mg ml−1 polyethylenimine (PEI MAX, Polysciences 24765), 200 ng of DNA of pSems leader ALFA-tag-γc and 2,800 ng of pSems leader mXFPe1-IL-2Rβ87. Labelling, washing and subsequent imaging were performed after mounting the coverslips into custom-made incubation chambers with a volume of 1 ml. Cells were equilibrated in medium with fetal bovine serum (FBS) but lacking phenol red, supplemented with an oxygen scavenger and a redox-active photoprotectant (0.5 mg ml−1 glucose oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.04 mg ml−1 catalase (Roche), 5% w/v glucose, 1 μM ascorbic acid and 1 μM methylviologene) to minimize photobleaching88.

Selective cell-surface receptor labelling was achieved by using anti-GFP and anti-ALFA-tag nanobodies (NBs), which were site-specifically labelled by maleimide chemistry via a single cysteine residue at their C termini88. Anti-ALFA NB labelled with Cy3B (degree of labelling (DOL): 1.06) and anti-GFP NB labelled with ATTO 643 (DOL: 1.0) were added at concentrations of 3 nM each, at least 10 min before imaging. Coverslips were precoated with poly-l-lysine-graft-poly(ethylene glycol) to minimize unspecific binding of NBs and were functionalized with RGD peptide for efficient cell adhesion89.

During the imaging experiments, ASNeo2 was used at 100 nM, and 10 μM effector was used to induce receptor dissociation.

Dual-colour imaging was performed by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy using an inverted microscope (IX83, Olympus) equipped with a spectral image splitter (QuadView, Photometrics) and an EMCCD camera (iXon Ultra, Andor) as described in detail elsewhere90. Fluorophores were excited by sequential illumination with a 561-nm laser (2RU-VFL-P-2000-560-B1R, 2,000 mW, MPB Communications) and a 642-nm laser (2RU-VFL-P-2000-642-B1R, 2,000 mW, MPB Communications). Alternating laser excitation was achieved with a simple micro-controller (Arduino Uno) and open-source acquisition software91 synchronizing laser shuttering with an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF; AA.AOTFnC-400.650-TN, AA Opto Electronic) and camera triggering. For long-term tracking experiments, 1,500 frames per channel were acquired at 40 fps. The resulting image stacks were divided into five-frame stacks and dimerization was determined for each stack. For Fig. 5f, three time courses, each normalized to its average initial relative dimerization, are overlaid for each condition. For all other tracking experiments, 200 frames per channel were acquired at 40 fps and dimerization was determined over the whole image stack.

Dual-colour single-molecule co-tracking time-lapse images were evaluated using an in-house-developed MATLAB software (SLIMfast4C, https://zenodo.org/record/5712332)88. After channel registration based on calibration with fiducial markers, molecules were localized using the multi-target tracking algorithm92. Immobile emitters were filtered out by spatio-temporal cluster analysis93. Frame-by-frame co-localization within a cut-off radius of 150 nm was applied followed by tracking of co-localized emitters using the utrack algorithm94. Molecules co-diffusing for ten frames or more were then identified as co-localized. Relative levels of co-localization were determined on the basis of the fraction of co-localized particles relative to all localizations in the ALFA-γc channel (561 nm). Diffusion properties were determined from the pooled single trajectory using mean squared displacement analysis for all trajectories with a lifetime greater than ten frames. Diffusion constants were determined from the mean squared displacement by linear regression. Relative dimerization was estimated by:

FRET efficiencies were evaluated using an in-house-developed MATLAB software (provided and described in detail elsewhere as supplementary software90). In brief, alternating laser excitation FRET experiments provide three separated emission channels: directly excited donor \({D}_{{D}_{{\rm{ex}}}}^{{D}_{{\rm{em}}}}\) and acceptor \({A}_{{A}_{{\rm{ex}}}}^{{A}_{{\rm{em}}}}\) channels, as well as a sensitized FRET \({F}_{{D}_{{\rm{ex}}}}^{{A}_{{\rm{em}}}}\) channel. First, channels were aligned by calibration with fiducial markers. Then, after applying a single-molecule localization algorithm95, single-molecule intensities were determined from background subtracted images (\({I}_{{D}_{{\rm{ex}}}}^{{D}_{{\rm{em}}}}\), \({I}_{{A}_{{\rm{ex}}}}^{{A}_{{\rm{em}}}}\), \({I}_{{D}_{{\rm{ex}}}}^{{A}_{{\rm{em}}}}\)). To evaluate FRET efficiencies, donor–acceptor pairs were co-localized with an optimized search radius. For these pairs, the apparent FRET efficiency was calculated by:

To achieve accurate FRET efficiencies, standard further corrections were applied. These include the donor leakage coefficient, cross-talk-corrected proximity ratio and the correction factor γ (refs. 90,96).

Human NK (YT-1) cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 complete medium, supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, minimum essential non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES and penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco). For the flow-cytometry-based pSTAT5 detection assay, 2–5 × 105 IL-2Rα-positive YT-1 cells were seeded in 350 µl of medium per well in a 96-well plate. The cells were stimulated with 1 nM ASNeo2 or Neo2 for 5 min at 37 °C. As a control, 50 µl of untreated YT-1 cells were set aside at the start of each experiment and evaluated after 45 min alongside the treated cells. After stimulation, all cells were transferred to three separate wells containing a control (no treatment), 10 μM effector or 40 μM ruxolitinib. One-seventh of the cells (50 µl) were resuspended in 17 µl of 16% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for immediate fixation. This process was repeated at 5-, 10-, 15-, 30- and 45-min intervals. After all of the time points were fixed, the cells were refixed in 4% PFA for 15 min at room temperature. After fixation, the cells were washed once with PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (PBSA) and permeabilized with 100% methanol for 45 min at 4 °C. After permeabilization, the cells were washed twice with PBSA and stained for one hour at room temperature using Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated phospho-STAT5 (Tyr694) rabbit monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 9365, clone C71E5) diluted 1:100. After three washing steps, the cells were analysed using a CytoFlex S flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Data were analysed with CytExpert software, and cells were gated on SSC-A versus FSC-A. Each experiment was done in triplicate, and the results were analysed accordingly.

For Fig. 5g, pSTAT5 signal is normalized to the background level. For Fig. 5h, n = 3 time courses were normalized to the signal at time 0 (just before effector addition) and a baseline signal was determined by the average of this normalized pSTAT5 of the untreated cells, then each time course was renormalized to this baseline signal. Some batches of cells were unresponsive to stimulation; data from these batches were excluded from analysis.

HeLa cells for single-molecule imaging were sourced from the DSMZ (ACC 57); YT-1 (CD25+) cells were sourced from ATCC. Cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling. HeLa cells tested negative for mycoplasma contamination by PCR.

Primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from a healthy donor by leukapheresis were thawed and resuspended at a cell density of 2 × 106 cells per ml in T cell medium, which contained RPMI 1640 (Gibco), FBS (10% v/v, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), HEPES (25 mM, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), penicillin–streptomycin (1% v/v, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), sodium pyruvate (1% v/v, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), MEM non-essential amino acids solution (1% v/v, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 2-mercaptoethanol (0.1% v/v, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and supplemented with human IL-2 (100 U ml−1). For human T cell activation, cells were activated with plate-bound anti-human CD3ε (1 μg ml−1, clone OKT-3, BioXCell) and soluble anti-human CD28 (5 μg ml−1, clone 9.3, BioXCell) for 48 h. Cells were then expanded in T cell medium with human IL-2 (100 U ml−1) for eight days. On day 9, IL-2 was withdrawn for 36 h, after which cells were resuspended at 1 × 106 cells per ml and stimulated with ASNeo2 (1 nM or 5 nM) for either 5 or 25 min, as indicated. Effector peptide (10 μM) was then added to terminate signalling. After 48 or 72 h, cells were collected for counting and phenotypic analysis by flow cytometry.

For Fig. 5i,j, cells were stimulated with 1 nM ASNeo2. For Fig. 5k–n, cells were stimulated with 5 nM ASNeo2.

For surface-marker staining, cells were collected into U-bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific), blocked with Human TruStain FcX (BioLegend) and incubated with the indicated antibodies at 4 °C for 20 min, followed by live–dead staining by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were then washed and resuspended with FACS buffer (PBS containing 0.2 % BSA; Sigma-Aldrich) for flow-cytometry analyses. For phospho-STAT staining, primary human T cells were rested in T cell medium lacking IL-2 for 24 h before signalling assays. Cells were plated in a 96-well round-bottom plate in 50 μl T cell medium. Cells were stimulated with 50 µl ASNeo2 for 5 min or 25 min, followed by the addition of effector peptide and incubation for another 20 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated by fixation with 1.5% PFA for 15 min at room temperature with agitation. Cells were washed and permeabilized with ice-cold 100% methanol for 60 min on ice. Afterward, cells were washed with FACS buffer before staining with pSTAT5 antibodies for one hour at 4 °C in the dark. Cells were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer for flow-cytometry analyses. For caspase-3 staining, cells were first stained for surface markers and Zombie Violet Fixable Dye (BioLegend), followed by staining with a FITC Active Caspase-3 Apoptosis Kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For transcription factor staining, cells were first stained for surface markers and Zombie Violet Fixable Dye, then fixed and permeabilized using a Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were subsequently incubated with the indicated antibodies for intracellular staining. Detection was performed using a CytoFlex (Beckman Coulter), and data were analysed with FlowJo (v.10.10.0).

The following antibodies or staining reagents were purchased from BioLegend: human CD3 (OKT3, 317324), human GATA3 (W19195B, 386906), human CD69 (FN50, 310932), human CD25 (BC96, 302611), human BCL2 (100, 658708), human Ki-67 (Ki-67, 350526), Human TruStain FcX (422302) and Zombie Violet Fixable Viability Kit (423114). The following antibodies or staining reagents were purchased from BD Biosciences: pSTAT5 (47/Stat5, 612599), and BD Pharmingen FITC Active Caspase-3 Apoptosis Kit (571606). DAPI was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific.

Antibodies were diluted 1:200 for surface markers (CD3, CD28, CD69 and CD25), 1:100 for intracellular proteins (GATA3, Ki-67 and BCL2) and 1:50 for pSTAT and caspase-3 staining.

Antibodies were validated by the manufacturers using flow cytometry.

Human T cells on day 9 after activation were subjected to IL-2 starvation for 36 h. The unstimulated control cells were maintained in culture without IL-2. For transient IL-2 signalling, cells were stimulated with ASNeo2 (5 nM) for 25 min, followed by the addition of effector peptide (10 μM) to terminate signalling. For sustained signalling, ASNeo2 (5 nM) was continuously maintained in the culture medium. Total RNA was extracted using the Quick-RNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with random primers. qPCR was performed using TaqMan master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System. BCL2 expression was measured using the TaqMan BCL2 assay, and gene expression was normalized to GAPDH (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Relative expression levels were calculated using the ΔΔCt method.

Human T cells on day 8 after activation were subjected to IL-2 starvation for 36 h. The unstimulated control cells were maintained in culture without IL-2. For transient IL-2 signalling, cells were stimulated with ASNeo2 (5 nM) for 25 min, followed by the addition of effector peptide (10 μM) to terminate signalling. For sustained signalling, ASNeo2 (5 nM) was continuously maintained in the culture medium. After six hours, cells were collected, and total RNA was extracted using the Quick-RNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research). RNA libraries were prepared using a poly(A) enrichment-based mRNA library preparation kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on the NovaSeq X Plus Series (PE150). Reads were aligned to the reference genome (GRCh38) using Rsubread, and gene expression was quantified with featureCounts. For analysing pathway enrichment, gene set co-regulation analysis (GESECA) was performed with hallmark gene sets from the Human Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). To reduce redundancy, we performed hierarchical clustering of hallmark gene sets with Jaccard's distance to yield eight gene-set clusters with minimal gene overlaps. Only one gene set with the lowest false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P value per cluster is shown in Fig. 5. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2, with FDR-adjusted P < 0.05 as a threshold for differential expression. Heat maps were created using normalized counts of genes identified as differentially upregulated or downregulated in both sustained versus unstimulated and transient versus unstimulated comparisons.

The main-text SPR, circular dichroism, FP, FRET and luminescence experiments, and also a subset of the DEER and SEC experiments, were performed twice (SPR in Figs. 2d,h and 4b; FRET in Fig. 4c; and SEC in Supplementary Fig. 9a) or three times (SPR in Fig. 2a,e–g; FP in Fig. 4b and Supplementary Figs. 5c and 12; luminescence in Fig. 4d,e; SEC in Supplementary Fig. 6b; and DEER with AS1 in Extended Data Fig. 2) to ensure reproducibility and low variance, and one representative experiment was reported owing to low variance among replicates. Having established low variance for these experiments, some similar measurements reported in the Supplementary Information were performed once. For all microscopy, cell staining, qPCR and RNA-seq experiments, three or four independent biological replicates were performed unless otherwise noted in the figure legend. All attempted replications of all experiments were successful, with the exception that some batches of YT-1 cells were unresponsive to stimulation; the findings in Fig. 5h were not observed with those batches. Allocation was random. No sample size calculations were performed; rather the sample sizes were chosen based on experience and were sufficient for the important observed differences between groups to be strongly statistically significant.

a, Crystal structure of AS5 alone (grey) overlaid with the design model of AS5 in state X (blue). Inset shows a detailed view of side chains in the partially open effector-binding cleft. b, Cocrystal structure of AS5 and peptide effector (grey) overlaid with the design model of the AS5–effector complex in state Y (AS5 in blue, effector in orange). Inset shows the same view of the side chains in the effector-binding cleft as in a. c, Design model of AS1 in state X (blue) aligned to the target (pink), showing a minor clash. d, Three cocrystal structures of AS1 (with intact cleft) and target with methylated lysines (grey) overlaid with the AF2 model of the target–AS1 complex in state X (AS1 in blue, target in pink), showing fluctuation in the target binding conformation.

a, Raw DEER traces (black), foreground fits (colours), and background fits (grey) for AS1 and AS114 with all combinations of target and effector. Experiments on complexes included the target, effector, or both in excess over the host at concentrations higher than required to fully form the complex (Supplementary Fig. 9), and spin labels were placed far from the target and effector binding sites. Thus, changes in the DEER distance distributions with different combinations of target and effector should only reflect changes in host conformation. b, Distance distributions from experiment (colours) and simulated from the structural state represented by the cartoons (black). For AS1, the simulated and experimental distance distributions agree well, further validating that each state adopts its designed conformation. For AS114, the simulations consistently overestimate the experimental distribution by ~5 Å, but the shift in the distance distributions with the effector compared to those without validates the designed conformational change. c, Experimental distance distributions of all states, coloured corresponding to b. For both AS1 and AS114, the ternary complex distribution (green) aligns with the host–effector complex distribution (orange) and not with the host alone (blue) or target–host complex (pink) distributions, confirming that the ternary complex is primarily in state Y. b,c, Lines represent the distance distribution which best fits the time domain data; shaded regions represent 95% confidence intervals from bootstrapping (Methods).

a, The Cα RMSD of the MD trajectories from the crystal structure (grey) is lower than from the aligned clashing design models of target and host–effector complex (black), showing that the MD simulations strain away from the clashing state in a manner similar to the crystal structure. b, Cα RMSD of the switch (blue) and target (pink) from their position in the crystal structure when the entire structures are aligned. Compared to trajectories 1 and 2, trajectory 3 shows reduced target deformation and increased switch deformation, showing that these trajectories differ in where they localize strain to resolve the clash. c, Per-residue Cα RMSF of the host (blue), target (pink), and effector (orange) in the ternary complex computed from each trajectory. The clashing region of the target (highlighted in grey) shows considerable flexibility, according with this region being disordered in the crystal structure. d, Comparison of MD simulations to experimental data. Left, crystal conformation of the ternary complex (grey) aligned to representative conformations from each MD trajectory (red, yellow, and light blue). DEER spin-label positions are shown in green. In the crystal structure, the clashing region on the target is disordered. In the MD simulations, although flexible, this region remains mostly ordered, causing additional deformation compared to the crystal structure. Illustrating the differences in strain localization among trajectories shown in b, in the first two trajectories (red and yellow), the switch conformation aligns with the crystal structure and the target deforms more; in the third trajectory (light blue), the target conformation aligns with the crystal structure and the switch deforms instead. Right, experimentally measured DEER distance distribution of the ternary complex (green line representing the best fit to the time domain data and shaded region representing 95% confidence interval from bootstrapping (Methods)) and distance distributions simulated from the crystal structure (grey line) or MD trajectories (dashed lines, colours correspond to the conformations shown at left). The distance distribution simulated from the crystal structure aligns with the left peak in the experimental distance distribution, whereas the distance distributions simulated from the MD trajectories span the experimental distance distribution, suggesting that these trajectories more fully sample the space of ternary complex dynamics.

a, Ratios of fold accelerations in the forward direction to those in the reverse direction, given by the equation: acceleration ratio = (koff,T:HE/koff,T:H) ÷ (koff,TH:E/koff,H:E). Acceleration ratios corresponding to designs with asymmetric distributions of strain are coloured orange, and to symmetric blue. b, Plot of forward vs reverse acceleration ratios, with linear fits for the symmetric and asymmetric groups. Note that on a log-log plot, the slope of a straight line passing through the origin becomes the y-intercept. c, For each design, design model of host–effector complex in state Y (blue and orange) aligned to the target (pink) to show the designed allosteric clash, and (grey) AF2 prediction of the target position relative to the switch in the ternary complex to show how the clash resolves through global strain. The target deforms downward in designs with an asymmetric distribution of strain, shearing the beta sheet, whereas it deforms outward in designs with a more symmetric distribution of strain, bending the beta sheet. d, Comparison of the AS1 binder–target interface (left) and switch–effector interface (right) (aligned at the host side) in the binary (colours) and ternary (grey) complex conformations, all from crystal structures, showing the binder–target interface deforms substantially more than the switch–effector interface in the ternary complex.

a, Design model of E2–target, comprising the target LHD101A (with mutations R43V and V69Q) fused to the effector peptide “E2” (cs201B) for hinge cs201. E2 is coloured green and LHD101A is coloured pink. b, Design models of E2–target (green/pink) bound to AS114 (blue) in state X showing no clash (left) and in state Y with the effector peptide (orange) showing a strong clash (right). c, Design models of the reporter hinge “H2” (cs201F with mutation E249L (sticks) which increases E2 on-rate and labelled with Alexa Fluors 555 and 647 at positions indicated by stars) in state X (left) and in state Y with E2–target (right). AS114 and H2 would overlap considerably if simultaneously bound to E2–target, so their binding should be mutually exclusive: AS114 should cage E2 until its release by the effector. d, Kinetics of E2–target and H2 association, measured by a change in FRET efficiency due to the conformational change in H2 upon binding. (Left) FRET time courses (normalized to the initial signal) with varying concentrations of E2–target and 5 nM H2; data (circles) fit with single exponentials (lines). (Right) apparent on-rate constants plotted against E2–target concentration (circles) and a linear fit. The value of the association rate constant (5e + 4 M−1s−1) is higher than the reported value (4.5e + 3 M−1s−1) for the original hinge cs201F with effector cs201B, suggesting that mutation E249L on H2 biases its conformational pre-equilibrium toward state Y to increase the apparent association rate. e, Additional data for the kinetically governed chain reaction shown in Fig. 4c. In the grey control time course, 500 nM AS114 was added to 20 nM H2, then 1 μM effector and 6 μM target was added at time 0, showing that none of these components bind to H2 to cause a change in FRET signal. In the other time courses, pre-incubated 500 nM AS114 and 250 nM E2–target was added to 20 nM H2, then buffer (blue), 1 μM effector (green), 6 μM target (pink), or both (orange) were added at time 0. A baseline drift (obtained from 500 nM AS114 after adding 20 nM H2 then at time 0 adding buffer) was subtracted from each time course, and time courses were normalized to the initial signal. The chain reaction proceeds faster when just excess target is added, probably due to blocking rebinding of E2–target to AS114 after transient dissociation39, but this effect is insufficient to achieve full acceleration. The chain reaction also proceeds faster when just effector is added, but probably due to transient rebinding of E2–target to re-form the strained ternary complex, this also does not achieve full acceleration. Adding both effector (to accelerate E2–target dissociation from AS114) and excess target (to prevent E2–target rebinding to AS114) is required to fully accelerate the chain reaction. Note that if a single-chain effector is desired to fully accelerate the chain reaction, the effector and target could be flexibly fused into a single construct. Such a multivalent effector would be reminiscent of CITED2, whose multivalency enables rapid and unidirectional competition against HIF-1α (ref. 102).

a, Structural model of the best SARS-CoV-2 sensor construct, comprising AScov (blue), the SmBiTgraft peptide with the effector (orange) and grafted SmBiT (green), LgBiT (grey or cyan), and flexible linkers (black). In this design, SmBiT is caged in a helical conformation when SmBiTgraft is bound to the switch and is free to reconstitute the luciferase when SmBiTgraft is released. To form SmBiTgraft, SmBiT was grafted onto the effector peptide such that most of its hydrophobic residues are buried within the switch–SmBiTgraft interface when in the bound helical conformation. Because the original effector peptide binds so strongly to the switch, it could accommodate replacing some of its interface residues with residues from SmBiT without reducing its affinity so much that it no longer effectively cages the SmBiT. b, SPR data showing sfGFP-SmBiTgraft binding to AS0 (blue and orange, association phase), slow subsequent dissociation in the absence of target (blue), and rapid subsequent dissociation upon addition of 10 μM target (orange) caused by rapid target binding to form a transient ternary complex, causing the spike at the beginning of the dissociation phase. c–f, Rapidly sensing the target through a facilitated dissociation mechanism (top), slowly sensing the effector limited by the slow base exchange rate of SmBiTgraft between binding AS0 and LgBiT (middle), and rapidly sensing the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with facilitated dissociation (bottom). c, Schematics showing the mechanism of sensing. d, Luminescence time courses (normalized to the initial signal) of 10 pM sensor construct then at time 0 adding varying concentrations of analyte (target, effector, or SARS-CoV-2 RBD); data (colours) fit (black) with single exponentials up to the maximum signal for time courses which showed appreciable signal increase. In some time courses, signal slowly decreases due to depletion of luciferase substrate. e, Luminescence signal fold change plotted against analyte concentration. f, Sensor response rate constant plotted against analyte concentration for time courses that showed appreciable signal increase.

a, Schematic depiction of the labelling strategy for single-molecule tracking experiments. b, Single-molecule trajectories of IL-2Rβ (red), γc (blue) and ASNeo2-induced heterodimers (magenta). c, Data from Fig. 5e as box plots to display datapoint variation including Neo2 (+/- effector) (green and orange, left side) and single-molecule tracking experiments with labelled ASNeo2 and γc (right side). Sample sizes and independent repeats are: unstimulated: 37 and 3; ASNeo2: 32 and 3; ASNeo2 + Effector: 33 and 3; Neo2: 44 and 4; Neo2 + Effector: 26 and 2; labelled ASNeo2: 21 and 2; labelled ASNeo2 + Effector: 18 and 2. d, Relative dimerization in relation to receptor cell surface density ratio indicates that high dimerization data variance is caused by differing IL-2Rβ to γc ratios at the plasma membrane. Even at high γc excess, effector-bound ASNeo2 shows no residual affinity for γc. e, Diffusion properties of IL-2Rβ and γc are reverted to the ground state after addition of effector. f, Immobile particles are increased upon stimulation, but not decreased after effector addition, potentially indicating receptors internalizing in membrane proximal endosomes. For e,f, the left box always corresponds to IL-2Rβ and the right one to γc. Sample sizes for d–f are as in c. g, Normalized localization density over time confirms minimal single-molecule bleaching in long-term single-molecule tracking experiments. Sample sizes and independent repeats are: without Effector: 5 and 5; with Effector: 3 and 3. h,i, Dissociation of ASNeo2-induced IL-2Rβ/γc dimers at the cell surface upon addition of 10 µM effector as detected by time-lapse single-molecule co-tracking (h) with colour-coded corresponding co-trajectories (i). j,k, Conformational change of ASNeo2 bound to the cell-surface receptor probed by smFRET. j, FRET efficiency histograms for ASNeo2 E4C/K211C labelled with Cy3B and ATTO643 bound to cells expressing IL-2Rβ and γc in the absence (blue) and presence (yellow) of 10 µM effector. Sample sizes are: without Effector: 7; with Effector: 5. k, smFRET co-localizations of one individual cell before the effector was added (left) and after it was added (right) colour-coded for FRET efficiency, highlighting the observation of individual molecules. Statistics for c,e,f were performed using two-sided two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests (ns, not significant, P values noted). Box plots show the distribution of the dataset, highlighting the median, quartiles, and outliers, with whiskers extending to the range limits. Scale bars in b,i: 5 µm.

a, Design models of ASNeo2 and selected cyclic permutations in state X, rainbow-coloured from N terminus (blue) to C terminus (red) to illustrate the protein topology. In ASNeo2, the switch is at the N terminus and Neo2 is at the C terminus. In the cyclic permutations, although the relative position of the switch and Neo2 changes minimally, the switch is in the middle of the protein, part of Neo2 is at the N terminus, and the other part is at the C terminus. This way, the regulatory switch cannot degrade without also breaking Neo2. b, SEC purifications performed on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column. The cyclic permutations are prone to aggregation during expression, but distinct monomer peaks can be picked out. c, Fast effector-concentration-dependent dissociation of γc from the ASNeo2–IL-2Rβ–γc complex upon addition of peptide effector.

Metrics details

Despite decades of investigation, it remains unclear (and hard to predict1,2,3,4) how the outcomes of chemical reactions change over multidimensional ‘hyperspaces' defined by reaction conditions5. Whereas human chemists can explore only a limited subset of these manifolds, automated platforms6,7,8,9,10,11,12 can generate thousands of reactions in parallel. Yet, purification and yield quantification remain bottlenecks, constrained by time-consuming and resource-intensive analytical techniques. As a result, our understanding of reaction hyperspaces remains fragmentary7,9,13,14,15,16. Are yield distributions smooth or corrugated? Do they conceal mechanistically new reactions? Can major products vary across different regions? Here, to address these questions, we developed a low-cost robotic platform using primarily optical detection to quantify yields of products and by-products at unprecedented throughput and minimal cost per condition. Scanning hyperspaces across thousands of conditions, we find and prove mathematically that, for continuous variables (concentrations, temperatures), individual yield distributions are generally slow-varying. At the same time, we uncover hyperspace regions of unexpected reactivity as well as switchovers between major products. Moreover, by systematically surveying substrate proportions, we reconstruct underlying reaction networks and expose hidden intermediates and products—even in reactions studied for well over a century. This hyperspace-scanning approach provides a versatile and scalable framework for reaction optimization and discovery. Crucially, it can help identify conditions under which complex mixtures can be driven cleanly towards different major products, thereby expanding synthetic diversity while reducing chemical input requirements.

Owing to rapid advances in chemical automation, there has been a growing number of high-throughput campaigns to discover new modes of reactivity6,7,12,16,17, maximize reaction yields (often under the guidance of various optimization algorithms9,15,18) and produce standardized data sought urgently19 by chemical artificial intelligence. Our goals here were different, as we wished to reconstruct complete portraits of chemical reactions over multidimensional parameter spaces (concentrations, temperatures), with the quantification of yields not only for the major products but also for as many by-products as could be identified. Anticipating thousands of crude mixtures to analyse (here >9,000 in total), we wished to minimize the use of techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS), which, at their maximum throughput of only a few samples per hour, become costly and require prolonged or even dedicated access to equipment, which may be prohibitive for most academic groups. Accordingly, we relied heavily on inexpensive (cents per sample) and rapid (about 100 samples per hour) ultraviolet–visible (UV-Vis) detection augmented with algorithms to decompose complex spectra (that is, not just those featuring distinct and easy-to-interpret spectral features20,21) and with autocorrelation metrics to quantify missing information and detect anomalous outcomes.

Unless otherwise stated, experiments were performed on a robotic platform (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Video 1) house-built to support various organic solvents and harsh reagents and allowing us to execute and characterize up to roughly 1,000 reactions per day (for design blueprints and computer codes, see Methods and Supplementary Information Sections 1 and 2).

a, Parts of the house-built, inexpensive (about $25K) system: (1) horizontal gantry; (2) liquid-handling module; (3) racks of pipette tips; (4) stock solutions; (5) 54-vial plates; (6) UV-Vis spectrophotometer; (7) balance for weighing of solutions (see Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). b, Hypothetical A + B → C reaction space defined by initial concentrations [A]0 and [B]0 and temperature T. c, UV-Vis spectra of the HPLC-isolated species are measured at different concentrations (here for Claisen–Schmidt condensation from Fig. 2a). d, At each point of the conditions' space, the UV-Vis spectrum (grey) is decomposed—here nearly perfectly—into the component spectra from c, quantifying the concentrations/yields of these components in the crude mixture. e, Stoichiometry of reaction places constraints on possible concentrations (blue) of components in the crude mixture (see Methods). f, Example of a perfect linear dependence (‘multicollinearity'), in which the brown spectrum in the top subplot happens to be a linear sum of the cyan and purple ones (scaled by, respectively, 0.50 and 0.25). Consequently, unmixing is an ill-conditioned problem, as the spectrum of the entire mixture (black) can be decomposed into infinitely many combinations of the brown, cyan and purple components (1:1:1 in the top and 0.5:0.75:2 in the bottom subplots). g, Correlation matrix for components A, B and C of the Claisen–Schmidt condensation from d. Low off-diagonal elements indicate no strong multicollinearity. h, Statistical distributions of yields with respect to the limiting reagent. Relative standard deviations are 2% between repeated optical detection performed on the same crude mixture (n = 54) and 5% between experimental repeats (n = 27) of the entire workflow for the same conditions (data from Fig. 5). i, Differences between experimental and modelled spectra (from d) as a function of wavelength. The fit is adequate, as this trace closely resembles uncorrelated (‘white') noise.

For a given reaction under study, this robot examines the hyperspace of conditions at points of some N-dimensional grid (for example, uniform in Fig. 1b), setting up reactions and acquiring UV-Vis absorption spectra at each point and at desired time(s). The acquisition of an individual spectrum takes, on average, roughly 8 s, whereas the accompanying pipetting and spectrometer washing–drying take about 50 s in total (Supplementary Video 2). In a subsequent (and perhaps counterintuitive) step, the crudes from all hyperspace points are combined (Fig. 1b, left). The resultant mixture is separated by chromatography and the isolated fractions are identified by traditional spectroscopic (NMR, MS) analyses. This ‘bulk' analysis is to identify the ‘basis set' of reaction products that form in any appreciable quantities anywhere in the hyperspace. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of these purified products (as well as all substrates, solvents and reagents used) at different concentrations are taken to construct concentration–absorbance calibration curves (Fig. 1c). Then the crude and often complex UV-Vis spectra acquired at each point of the hyperspace (Fig. 1b, right) are fitted by linear combinations of the reference spectra of the basis-set components (Fig. 1d) using the so-called vector decomposition techniques (also known as spectral unmixing22). Overall, this protocol requires conventional high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/NMR/MS analysis of only one complex mixture combining all hyperspace samples (Fig. 1c). It returns on this time investment manifolds by rapidly estimating the yields and mixture compositions at thousands of individual data points within the hyperspace of the reaction.

This general scheme merits two comments. First, it is important to reject potential unmixing solutions violating reaction stoichiometry (Fig. 1e) and to ensure stability of the fit. The latter benefits from the absorption spectra of components being of similar magnitudes and not linearly dependent (Fig. 1f), which is diagnosed by looking at off-diagonal elements of the correlation matrix between the concentrations of the components (Fig. 1g). Satisfying these conditions (1) is increasingly challenging as the number of components increases but (2) is helped by extending the spectral range as much as possible into the UV, at which the absorption bands of organic species are usually more numerous and narrower (see the example in Fig. 5b). With these precautions, yield estimates are within 5% (for example, a 20% yield would have a spread of 19–21%), with optical measurement and spectral unmixing contributing 2% and the remaining 3% caused by uncertainty of pipetting, fluctuations of temperature and residual evaporation (Fig. 1h and Supplementary Information Sections 2.10 and 2.11).

Second, the fitting procedure is accompanied by an algorithm to detect anomalous outcomes in some regions of the hyperspace. This is done by tracking differences between experimental and fitted spectra, calculating the variance of residuals (Fig. 1i) and evaluating the autocorrelation (across wavelengths, not time) of these residuals by the Durbin–Watson statistic. The mismatch is considered notable if the root mean square residual exceeds 0.01 absorbance units or if the Durbin–Watson statistic at 30 nm ‘lag' deviates from the value of 2 (which corresponds to the absence of autocorrelation) more strongly than the respective statistic for the baseline of a given spectrophotometer. If systematic deviation is detected, it then signifies formation of a product unexpected based on the initial scan of the hyperspace (see Fig. 3d,e). Further mathematical details of spectral unmixing and anomaly detection are discussed in Supplementary Information Section 3.

We confirmed that this method is applicable to a range of reactions used widely in both academic groups and industry, including various couplings, condensations, cycloadditions and rearrangements (reactions 1–8 on the green background in Extended Data Fig. 1a), as well as substitutions, eliminations and multicomponent reactions (MCRs), discussed in detail in Figs. 2–6. Expectedly, the approach is not suitable for, for example, reactions of aliphatic scaffolds whose products give no signal in the UV-Vis range above 220 nm and some reactions are borderline in terms of fit quality, owing to the obstruction of the product signal by reactant/solvent peaks (for example, 9–12 in the yellow and red portions of Extended Data Fig. 1a). Notably, yields quantified by the robotized approach correlate strongly, R2 = 0.96, with the yields of the same reactions performed, purified and analysed ex roboto (Extended Data Fig. 1b).

a,b, Schemes of E1 (a) and SN1 (b) reactions and their mechanisms. For the former, we use 9-butyl-9H-fluoren-9-ol substrate 13a and for the latter, to prevent elimination, 9-phenyl-9H-fluoren-9-ol 14a. For E1, the parameters of the mechanism are the temperature dependences of equilibrium constant Kα for dynamic equilibrium between 13a and its protonated form, of equilibrium constant Kβ for dynamic equilibrium between 13b and its protonated form, of pKa of HBr in acetonitrile and the Eyring–Polanyi equation parameters for kinetic rate constants kE1 and k−E1 for water molecule elimination from the protonated 13a (Supplementary Information Section 5.2). For SN1 at a given temperature, the only parameter is the effective equilibrium constant KSN1 = [14b][H2O]/([14a][HBr]) (Supplementary Information Section 5.1). E1 used acetonitrile as solvent. For SN1, the solvent was dioxane with admixture of AcOH (to homogenize the biphasic dioxane–water mixture formed in situ and complicating optical detection). c,d, Corresponding yield distributions of products 13b and 14b. For clarity, only 125 conditions per cube are shown. Marker colours and sizes are proportional to yields. Yield colour scales are the same for both cubes. Surfaces of equal yield are at 20%, 40%, 70% and 85%. e,f, Kinetics model (curves) fitted to experimental yields with respect to alcohol (circles) for E1 and SN1 reactions. To better visualize the quality of fits, only two-dimensional snapshots of the entire dataset are shown, here T = 21 °C for E1 and T = 36 °C for SN1 (for similar plots at all temperatures, see Supplementary Information Sections 5.1 and 5.2). Horizontal axis has the initial concentrations of HBr, with the colour corresponding to different initial concentrations of the alcohol indicated in the keys.

a, Scheme of a reaction between alcohol 15a and HBr leading to major product 15b through anthranyl carbocation 15c. The minor anthraquinone product 15d originates from the cycloaddition of substrate 15a with singlet oxygen to give the endoperoxide, followed by subsequent fragmentations (for details, see Supplementary Fig. 32). The ‘unexpected' carbocation dimer structure is assigned to 15e (for details of structural assignment, see Supplementary Information Sections 4.13 and 6.2). b, Space of reaction yields of the main product 15b under different conditions (reaction time: 24 h; for clarity, only 125 out of 1,085 points are shown; for all data, see Supplementary Information Section 4.15). Fitting the kinetic model to these experimental data reveals that yields of product 15b scale as \(1-\exp \left(-t{k}_{1}[{\rm{HBr}}]\exp \left(-\frac{{E}_{{\rm{a}}}}{{k}_{{\rm{B}}}T}\right)\right)\), in which t is reaction time, \({k}_{1}\exp \left(-\frac{{E}_{{\rm{a}}}}{{k}_{{\rm{B}}}T}\right)\) is the kinetic rate constant at a given temperature (prefactor k1 is a free parameter), Ea is the activation energy free parameter and [HBr] is the concentration of HBr—that is, these conversions increase with [HBr] and with temperature, do not depend on the initial concentration of the alcohol substrate and the rate-limiting step is formation of a carbocation 15c, all as expected for SN1 reaction. The isosurfaces correspond to 20%, 40%, 70% and 85% yield. c, Distribution of yields for the side product 15d. The isosurface corresponds to 20% yield. d, Pink cloud delineates a narrow region of conditions in which an anomalous outcome—that is, carbocation dimer 15e—is observed. e, Pink line is a typical UV-Vis spectrum from the region of conditions in which an anomalous outcome is observed. The dashed line is a typical experimental spectrum for which this anomaly is absent. Blue line is the ab initio theoretical absorption spectrum of 1.23 nM of 15e after summation with the dashed ‘baseline', blue band is the 1σ confidence interval (see Supplementary Information Section 6.2).

a–d, Snapshots of the reaction's four-dimensional hyperspace. The axes of each plot are initial amine, aldehyde and isocyanide concentrations for initial concentrations of pTSA indicated above each plot. Experimental yields (after 16 h at 26 °C) of product 16e are colour-coded according to the legend in d. Only 125 interpolated conditions per cube are shown for clarity (see Supplementary Information Section 4.15 and Supplementary Video 3). Green and blue stars mark two distinct yield maxima. e–h, Corresponding yield distributions of 16e predicted by a kinetic model fitted simultaneously to all experimental data (yield isosurfaces are at 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5% and 5.0%). This model is based on a kinetic network outlined in i and further side reactions (see Supplementary Information Scheme 5). The original reaction of 16a, 16b, 16c and DMF using initiator 16d and leading to product 16e is on the yellow background. The classic Ugi mechanism is summarized by blue arrows (for details, see Supplementary Information Scheme 6). A competing oxazoline-based path (brown) was experimentally excluded (red cross). A third mechanism (magenta), potentially active at high [pTSA]0 and involving aldehyde, amine and isocyanide in a 1:1:2 ratio, did not improve model fit. The theoretical model (Supplementary Tables 19, 20, 22 and 23) comprised this entire mechanistic network of 12 reactions and 15 proton transfer steps. Best-fitted model followed the data closely while retaining pKa values (in red font) of most species within 1–2 units from literature values (black font) used as initial guess (see Supplementary Information Section 5.3). j, Experimental and modelled yield profiles at the two maxima (corners A and B in a) along [pTSA]0 confirm that yields at global/local maxima are higher than at any four-dimensional paths connecting them (see Supplementary Video 3 and Supplementary Fig. 161). Error bars correspond to 14.6% relative standard error. k, Initial concentrations at global and local maxima.

a, Identification of reaction products by closed-loop repurification and refitting against four-dimensional hypercube UV-Vis spectra (see Supplementary Information Section 4.15). Within eight repurification rounds, 16 components (14 products plus unreacted 19a and 19c) were identified. The mismatch between fitted and experimental spectra (vertical axis) decreased to the median value of instrumental uncertainty (dashed green line; see Supplementary Information Section 4.9). The vertical axis shows the highest spectral mismatch per condition. Box plot elements indicate the first quartile, median and third quartile, whiskers show the 5th and 95th percentiles, with outliers as black diamonds. Blue scatter plot shows individual data points. b, UV-Vis ‘basis set' of the 16 components. Their discovery follows the cycles in a: 3 components (19a, 19c, 19d), 7 components (+19k, 19r, 19o, 19m), 8 components (+EAB), 11 components (+19j, 19f, 19g), 12 components (+19e), 14 components (+19h, 19p), 15 components (+19i), 16 components (+19h). c, Reaction network: green, substrates; blue, isolated known products/intermediates; red, new products/intermediates. Network connectivity was verified by separate reactions (green arrows): (1) NH4OAc, AcOH, 80 °C, 18 h; (2) ethyl acetoacetate, EtOH, 80 °C, 18 h; (3) EAB, EtOH, 80 °C, 24 h. Note the presence of products of two separate ‘named reactions', Hantzsch (19d) and Petrenko-Kritschenko (19e) (mechanisms are shown in Supplementary Information Schemes 2 and 3. d–f, Within the hyperspace, the reaction network at 80 °C can be switched between three main products observed in different corners of the space: Hantzsch ester 19d (maximum yield 63.5%, <3% 19p) (d); Petrenko-Kritschenko product 19e (maximum yield about 66%) (e); benzylidene-extended Hantzsch derivative 19k (maximum yield 61.7%) (f). These yields (after 48 h) were quantified by HPLC and are colour-coded according to the legend. Isosurfaces correspond to 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% and 60% yield. For full experimental details, see Supplementary Information Sections 4.7, 4.9 and 4.10.

a, 756 PBAs, catalysts with a general formula KMB[MA(CN)6], were prepared by the robot in separate vials using the co-precipitation method. Up to two aqueous solutions of MA and up to five of MB were pipetted automatically with specified volumes to prepare the PBA catalyst suspensions, each with a final volume of 200 µl in individual vials, followed by 24 h of ageing at room temperature. b, Irrespective of the composition, these nanomaterials were particles approximately 50 nm in size. Uniformity of metal distributions was confirmed by energy-dispersive spectroscopy. For large-area scanning electron microscopy images and all experimental details, see Supplementary Information Section 8. Scale bars, 20 nm. c, Five-dimensional hyperspace of yields of styrene oxide reconstructed by spectral unmixing. d, Five-dimensional hyperspace of selectivity of styrene oxide reconstructed by spectral unmixing. e, At least five PBAs (red markers 1–5 here and black circles in the corresponding hyperspace in c) showed yield–selectivity properties better than previously studied PBAs (blue markers), as well as some other controls (grey markers: Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Fe(CN)63+, Co(CN)63− and the last one without any catalyst; see raw data in Supplementary Table 34). f, The robotically reconstructed hyperspace allowed for the identification of four products unreported in previous PBA studies of this reaction (20d, 20e, 20f and 20g shown on green backgrounds) and for the reconstruction of the reaction's mechanistic network involving four intermediates 20h, 20i, 20j and 20k. The blue fishhook arrows on species 20d indicate the electron flow to furnish aldehyde 20b (R = t-BuOO, t-BuO or HO), whereas the purple fishhook arrows on species 20k indicate the electron flow to furnish epoxide 20c (ref. 56). For the generation of radicals from tert-butyl hydroperoxide, see Supplementary Information Section 8.7.

With these capabilities, we began to explore and analyse hyperspaces of several classic reaction types differing in mechanistic complexity. In doing so, we focused on yield distributions at reaction time of several hours (that is, the situation relevant to synthetic organic practice) and on hyperspace regions featuring maximal degree of variability (as opposed to regions in which, for example, concentrations are so high that yields are all ‘saturated'; see Supplementary Fig. 121). For clarity, in Figs. 2–6, we plot only the subsets of data points, with all raw data available at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14880579).

Starting simple, we considered the spaces of the E1 elimination and SN1 substitution23,24 using, respectively, substrates 13a and 14a. The space of E1 was examined at t = 4 h for 775 conditions and that of SN1 at t = 48 h for 930 conditions. The three-dimensional yield distributions shown in Fig. 2c,d for reaction products 13b and 14b are approximately concave, steadily increasing towards the global maximum (in bimolecular SN1, there is shoulder maximum in the region in which the concentration of the limiting reagent 14a is low; see also Extended Data Fig. 2). Mathematically, the ‘steepness' of these surfaces can be quantified by the slopes of the product concentration with respect to the initial concentration of substrate(s), Dij = ∂Ci/∂C0,j—as shown in Supplementary Fig. 166, the absolute values of these slopes, |Dij| are small, at or below unity. Analysis of residuals detects no anomalies and, under all conditions, only substrates and the product are present in various proportions (for example, E1 is not accompanied by SN1 side reaction). Of note, yield data contained in the ‘cubes' allow for fitting approximate kinetic models (by time-integrating the underlying kinetic equations) and for deriving reasonable values of some kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, such as ΔH, ΔH‡ or ΔS (see caption to Fig. 2, Methods and Supplementary Information Sections 5.1 and 5.2 for derivations). Even though the data correspond to only one time point, the abundance of yield values for various substrate concentrations imposes hundreds of constraints against which a candidate model must simultaneously fit, thus limiting the acceptable parameters of the model. In the ‘A four-dimensional hyperspace' section, we will use this approach to interrogate more complex mechanisms.

Next, we revisited the SN1 reaction but with 15a used as a substrate (Fig. 3a). The main product 15b forms through the rearrangement of the carbocation 15c, and its yield distribution over the 1,085 conditions fits closely to the expected first-order kinetics (see caption to Fig. 3b). The algorithm also detects a minor anthraquinone by-product 15d congruent with the Diels–Alder reaction with singlet-state oxygen25,26 and distributed as illustrated in Fig. 3c. Most notably, analysis of residuals (Fig. 1i) provides the first example of a systematic anomaly and an unexpected outcome in a narrow region of low HBr concentrations marked in pink in Fig. 3d. This species exhibits an intensely pink colour that gradually wanes over two days (and disappears rapidly during purification attempts). Its UV-Vis spectrum (Fig. 3e) does not agree with absorption spectra of 15c or structurally similar carbocations27,28,29, but extensive analyses based on MS as well as time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations (Supplementary Information Sections 4.13 and 6.2) support assignment as a carbocation dimer 15e resulting from a reaction between 15c and 15a (with enough HBr to create 15c, but with the amount of water introduced by this HBr insufficient to quench the intermediate into 15b). To our best knowledge, dimerization of a substrate with its own derived carbocationic intermediate has only been observed under superacidic conditions at temperatures down to −50 °C (ref. 30) but never in the presence of quenching nucleophiles (here H2O and Br−) and under ambient conditions. We emphasize, however, that even with the presence of this anomaly, the hyperspace remains simple—that is, each of its constituent species features only one yield maximum—and the yield distributions of all species are slowly varying, |Dij| ≈ 1 (Supplementary Information Fig. 166), including 15e, which forms over a narrow range but in only approximately 1 nM concentration.

In search for more topologically complex hyperspaces, we turned to reactions that involve more than two substrates and are based on much more complex mechanisms. As the first case, we interrogated a four-component Ugi-type reaction from ref. 31, illustrated in Fig. 4 and chosen because of distinct UV-Vis signal of the cyclized product 16e. For this cyclization reaction, 3,234 conditions were investigated within a four-dimensional space defined by different initial concentrations of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde 16a, n-butylamine 16b and p-tosylmethyl isocyanide 16c substrates (DMF substrate was also a solvent of constant concentration), as well as p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate, pTSA 16d, acting as a reaction initiator.

The hyperspace illustrated in Fig. 4a–d and Supplementary Video 3 now reveals the presence of two distinct yield maxima for the heterocyclic product 16e—a global maximum marked by a green star and a local maximum marked by a blue star. Further sampling of the conditions' grid in the region between the maxima confirms that they are separated in four-dimensional space by a region of low yield (Fig. 4j and Supplementary Figs. 160c and 161).

Notably, MS analyses (Supplementary Information Section 4.8) evidence distinct signals at these two maxima: the local maximum gives a peak m/z ratio corresponding to the iminium ion 18c expected for the classical Ugi mechanism32,33, whereas the global maximum also features a peak attributable to the oxazoline 17e. This, in turn, may suggest an extra mechanism (brown arrows) through the oxazoline 17e intermediate—alternative mechanisms for the Ugi reaction have, indeed, been postulated for decades but never proved34,35. However, such a possibility is directly disqualified by separate, ex roboto experiments in which isolated 17e fails to give product 16e on further reaction with n-butylamine in the presence of pTSA (Supplementary Information Section 4.8.4). Although other mechanisms can also be considered (see magenta arrows in Fig. 4 and corresponding caption), fitting the experimental hyperspace data to the kinetic network of 12 reactions and 15 proton transfer steps (Fig. 4i and theoretical details in Supplementary Information Section 5.3) suggests that an excellent agreement can be achieved (Fig. 4e–h) based only on the Ugi mechanism—that is, inclusion of extra mechanisms offers no perceptible improvement. Instead, the emergence of the two maxima can be attributed to the shifts in the equilibria underlying the network (Supplementary Information Sections 5.3.4 and 5.3.5). We also note that evolution of these maxima following changes in pTSA concentration is very gradual (Supplementary Video 3) and the yield distributions are characterized by very small ‘slopes', |Dij| ≲ 1 (Supplementary Fig. 166).

Next, we considered the classic Hantzsch pyridine synthesis (Fig. 5), studied for almost 150 years (refs. 36,37,38) and interesting for several known intermediates and competing pathways (coloured in blue in Fig. 5c). Notably, examining the four-dimensional hyperspace (concentrations of the three substrates, 26 °C and 80 °C temperatures; a total of 2,582 conditions) revealed the presence of many more components than previously thought. Their isolation required several HPLC repurification cycles performed in a closed-loop manner. Specifically, after each cycle, the newly identified substances were added to the spectral unmixing algorithm and the global fits to experimental spectra from the entire hypercube gradually improved (Fig. 5a,b); meanwhile, more fractions were selected for the next round of purification if they featured yet-unassigned signals (Supplementary Information Sections 4.9 and 4.10). After eight such fitting–purification cycles, the mismatch between the fitted and experimental spectra reached instrumental noise (dashed green line in Fig. 5a), at which point our knowledge of the hyperspace composition can, for all practical reasons, be deemed nearly complete. This knowledge spans not only the seven known species36,37,38 but also nine new ones (coloured red in Fig. 5c) that have not been reported in the classical Hantzsch reaction but can be of interest in the context of biological activity39.

By considering the causal relationships between these and other species discovered within the hyperspace, it is possible to establish the synthetic connectivity of the isolated species (Supplementary Information Section 4.10). This analysis, ultimately, reconstructs the complete network of the Hantzsch reaction detailed in Fig. 5c with key steps confirmed by further ex roboto reactions (marked by green arrows). Notably, analysis of yield distributions (with the help of HPLC, as spectral unmixing of all 16 components is no longer unique) revealed that, by adjusting substrate concentrations at 80 °C, the network can be switched between three different major products (19d, 19e, 19k), each forming in >60% yield and with maxima located at different corners of the conditions' cube (Fig. 5d–f). One of these switchovers is between the Hantzsch ester (19d) and the Petrenko-Kritschenko product (19e)40, meaning that even the so-called named reactions can, in reality, be part of the same hyperspace. Another observation is that, despite the switchovers, the individual yield distributions for individual species remain smooth, as visualized by the isosurfaces in Fig. 5d–f.

Finally, we consider a hyperspace in which dimensions correspond to systematic variations in composition. Here these compositions are the contents of different metals in the Prussian blue analogues (PBAs)41 (Fig. 6), which are perovskite-type materials described by a general formula KMB[MA(CN)6] and widely studied in the context of catalysis and energy storage42. The robot surveys a five-dimensional space defined by the contents of metals at sites MA (two types, Fe and Co) and MB (five types, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) over a uniform grid with the granularity of 0.2 (for example, Mn0.2Ni0.4Cu0.4–Fe0.6Co0.4 PBA versus Mn0.2Ni0.2Cu0.6–Fe0.4Co0.6 PBA, with molar fractions at A and B sites each summing to unity). Each of the 756 PBAs is prepared in situ by straightforward co-precipitation method (Fig. 6a,b) and is used to catalyse reaction of styrene 20a and t-BuOOH to give styrene oxide 20c (given that styrene oxide is the key intermediate to synthesize many fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals43, this reaction has been the subject of several studies using various catalysts, including PBAs44,45). Figure 6c shows the distribution of reaction yields and Fig. 6d quantifies the selectivities with respect to benzaldehyde 20b, the main by-product of the reaction. As seen, the yield hyperspace is much more corrugated than concentration–temperature hyperspaces from Figs. 2–5 and features several local yield maxima. Notably, it contains several PBA compositions that offer better yield–selectivity characteristics than previously reported PBAs44,45 or other controls (Fig. 6e). As in other examples that we considered, the hyperspace reconstruction reveals the presence of unreported intermediates and by-products and helps reconstruct a mechanistic network (Fig. 6f) that had previously remained elusive44,45,46.

One of the insights from these studies is the relatively simple structure of the concentration–temperature spaces, with yield distributions of any single species featuring, at most, two yield maxima and with the slope values |Dij| at or below unity (Supplementary Fig. 166). As described in Supplementary Information Sections 7.1 and 7.2, it can be rigorously proved that, for strongly connected, directed hypergraphs47,48 (that is, those that cannot be split into non-interacting subsets of reactions) and for first-order and pseudo-first-order reactions, |Dij| ≤ 1. For higher-order kinetics of individual reactions, the theoretical upper bound on |Dij| is too high to be practically relevant, but numerical studies of networks comprising first-order and second-order steps and no cycles confirm that |Dij| is also typically on the order of unity. A corollary to this result is that, along concentration coordinates C0,j, j = 1,…,k, the hypersurfaces can be examined faithfully at sparse intervals (see Supplementary Information Section 7.6). This, in turn, can help reduce the number of experiments during conditions' screening and optimization campaigns. For more discussion of hyperspace properties (in terms of topology, differential yields and Shannon information theory), see Supplementary Figs. 161 and 162 and Supplementary Information Section 4.12.

Naturally, these considerations do not apply to hyperspaces in which compositions are varied. For instance, different catalysts (as in Fig. 6) can lower the activation barriers substantially and to different extents. As a result, they can alter the network-wide kinetics more than changes over a limited range of concentrations or temperatures, resulting in ‘steeper' concentration derivatives and in the hyperspace featuring many local yield maxima.

The method by which we reconstructed reaction networks is loosely analogous to the approaches used in electronics to reverse-engineer a circuit inside a ‘black box' by applying inputs and analysing corresponding outputs. Here the inputs are the various substrate concentrations and temperatures and the outputs are the identities of the products found by the global analysis of the hyperspace. With the set of products identified, the ‘wiring' of the network is prescribed by the general rules of chemical reactivity. In the cases studied here, the wirings could be reconstructed relatively readily by humans but, as illustrated in Supplementary Information Section 4.11, this process can also be aided by network algorithms operating either at the level of mechanistic steps4,49 or full reactions50, thereby linking the hyperspace of conditions to the ‘space of reaction grammars'5, a link argued to be key to chemical innovation5. In this effort, the broad investigation of the hyperspace is essential, as different inputs can serve to ‘activate' or ‘deactivate' different branches of the network (by modifying reaction rates and shifting equilibria), enabling the formation of as many products as possible. This also means investigating the reaction space at stoichiometries that a human chemist might not necessarily find intuitive or relevant to a particular reaction. Here this approach more than doubled the knowledge of the Hantzsch hyperspace and we have seen similar discovery enhancements in other reactions that we have studied since then (for example, Pechmann, Biginelli). From a technical point of view, our ability to interrogate entire spaces of conditions capitalizes on the use of inexpensive (cents per sample) optical detection, which reduces the need for costly (about $45–300 per sample) HPLC/quantitative NMR analyses by a factor of several hundred (for example, one HPLC/NMR cycle per 1,085 UV-Vis experiments to reconstruct the SN1 network in Fig. 3; eight closed-loop cycles to ensure complete knowledge of the Hantzsch space examined by UV-Vis at 2,582 conditions). As long as the equilibrium is not fully reached (Supplementary Figs. 154 and 160), sweeping the reaction rates through control of starting concentrations accesses the type of data similar to conventional kinetic experiments (that ‘sweep' the time to observation instead) and estimation of kinetic parameters becomes possible.

A related aspect is the practical ability to direct these reaction networks towards desired outcomes by simply adjusting concentrations (that is, without using different reagents, as done in some recent excellent papers, such as ref. 51). For simple reactions, such stoichiometric control is, of course, well known (for example, we can influence the ratio of monosubstituted to disubstituted product of alkyl dibromide by using one versus two equivalents of the nucleophile). However, for multicomponent reaction mixtures, it is less obvious that they can be pushed cleanly towards different major products. We have seen this capability realized for the Hantzsch reaction, in which the yields of major products 19d, 19e and 19k were maximized at concentration ratios very different from those we may expect based on product stoichiometry alone. For instance, product 19e incorporates one copy of substrate 19a, two copies of 19b and two copies of 19c, but in the hyperspace in Fig. 5e, the regions of appreciable yield, >40%, start from about 1:4.5:2 ratio (and continue for even higher molar excess of 19b at the yield maximum, which, however, becomes wasteful in terms of substrate use; see Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Information Section 4.17).

In conclusion, this work is an initial effort—made possible by modern reaction automation—to understand the structure of reaction hyperspaces, one of the five foundational spaces of mathematical chemistry5. It reinforces the view of chemical reactions as networks4,51,52 embedded in multidimensional spaces of conditions and, at least in some cases, switchable between different major products, which is reminiscent of some biochemical networks53,54 and promising in terms of diversity-oriented synthesis55. The rapid and cost-effective approach to hyperspace reconstruction can (1) systematize and accelerate reaction discovery and optimization and (2) foster fundamental research on reaction networks as dynamic systems. This effort can be aided by hyperspace visualization and analysis tools such as those we developed and make available at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14880579; see also Supplementary Video 4). In a broader context, inclusion of our experimental yield maps to the benchmarks used for testing the general-purpose yield optimization algorithms9,11,15 would appreciably widen the diversity of these benchmarks, given the current scarcity of such datasets7,9,13,15. In future work, we aim to extend our robotic platform to reactions that require solid dispensing and/or strictly oxygen-free conditions (this will broaden the scope of hyperspaces we can analyse), to accelerate dispensing and measuring operations (to analyse fast reactions) and also to monitor hyperspace evolution over time, which will be necessary to reconstruct highly nonlinear mechanisms (for example, oscillating reactions).

Reagent addition was carried out using a commercial pipetting module (ZEUS, Hamilton), optimized for pipetting a range of organic solvents in aliquots ranging from 10 µl to 1 ml, with volumetric errors of less than 1% for volumes greater than 50 µl and less than 2% for volumes between 10 and 50 µl. Liquids were dispensed into 2-ml glass vials arranged in custom-designed 54-well plates, with each reaction typically set to a final volume of 500 µl. Following reagent addition, vials were hermetically sealed using a flat lid, with a rubber sheet and perfluoroalkoxy film placed between the lid and the vial. Initial mixing was performed on an orbital shaker at 250 rpm for 5 min. Subsequent stirring is omitted, as separate studies (see Supplementary Information Sections 2.9 and 4.5) have shown that, for vials of these dimensions, passive mixing over the course of the reaction (hours) is as efficient as mechanical stirring, thereby eliminating the need for cumbersome stir bars.

After reactions were run for desired times, the crude mixture from each vial was, if necessary, automatically diluted to align with the detection range of the UV-Vis spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The operation of the spectrophotometer was also automated, including lid opening and closing, along with the flushing and drying of the measuring pedestal (see Supplementary Video 2). All of these operations were orchestrated by house-written software. The entire assembly was placed inside a hood and, if needed, constantly purged with nitrogen. The manual operations in the entire workflow were changing the 54-well plates, covering them with rubber/perfluoroalkoxy sheets and placing on the orbital shaker. For some hyperspaces, two such systems were used. Further technical details and the blueprints for system replication are provided in Supplementary Information Section 2 and at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14880579)57. The software design is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 2 and the source code is deposited at https://github.com/yaroslavsobolev/robowski-maps.

The full cubes of 775 E1 conditions (five temperatures, 16–36 °C; five initial substrate concentrations, 1.5–15.0 mM; 31 HBr concentrations, 0.1–10.0 mM; reaction time: 4 h) and 930 SN1 conditions (six temperatures; 16–66 °C; five 9-butyl-9H-fluoren-9-ol substrate concentrations, 0.03–0.30 M; 31 HBr concentrations; reaction time: 48 h) are provided in Supplementary Information Section 4.15, with all raw data in the Zenodo repository.

Stoichiometry constraints, as shown in Fig. 1e, were included into the spectral unmixing algorithm by modifying the log-likelihood function L to be minimized: L is a sum of squared spectral mismatch (yellow) of experimental Ameasured(λ) and modelled Amodel(λ) absorbances, divided by the instrumental variance of the spectrophotometer σ2(λ, Ameasured(λ)), and the term representing the violation of stoichiometric inequalities (red) containing the Heaviside function θ(x) and the experimental uncertainties \({\sigma }_{{[{\rm{A}}]}_{0}}\) and \({\sigma }_{{[{\rm{B}}]}_{0}}\) of preparing the reaction mixture with given starting concentrations. See Supplementary Information Section 3 for more details about the spectral unmixing algorithm

The isosurfaces in Figs. 2–5 were extracted by the marching cubes algorithm58 operating on a 50 × 50 × 50 regular grid obtained through the radial basis functions interpolator applied to the raw data. This method was implemented in the HyperspaceViewer software, which is provided in the Supplementary Information and is open-sourced at a GitLab repository (https://gitlab.com/az-steak/hyperspace_viewer).

The kinetic fitting in Fig. 2e,f was done by numerically integrating the equations of the mechanism and optimizing the parameters to achieve the best-fit of the model's predicted product yields simultaneously to all experimental data. This procedure gave reasonable estimates of the reactions' thermodynamic parameters: ΔH = −30.7 ± 1.4 kJ mol−1 for SN1 and \(\Delta H={81.98}_{-1.64}^{+3.52}\,{\rm{kJ}}\,{{\rm{mol}}}^{-1}\), \(\Delta S={273.8}_{-4.9}^{+10.8}\,{\rm{J}}\,{{\rm{mol}}}^{-1}\,{{\rm{K}}}^{-1}\) and \({\Delta H}^{\ddagger }={21.10}_{-0.49}^{+0.33}\,{\rm{kJ}}\,{{\rm{mol}}}^{-1}\) (transition state enthalpy) for E1. For derivations of these values and comparisons against related literature examples, see Supplementary Information Sections 5.1 and 5.2.

Initial guess of kinetic parameters (Fig. 4e–h) was provided by the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm59, kinetic equations at each condition were integrated numerically and the discrepancy against the experimental yield distribution (over the hyperspace) was minimized using the trust region reflective algorithm60. See Supplementary Information Section 5.3 for further details of the kinetic model.

PBAs were synthesized following a reported co-precipitation method61. Two stock solutions containing metal MA (Fe, Co) were prepared by dissolving K3[Fe(CN)6] or K3[Co(CN)6] in deionized water to form clear solutions of type A (0.10 M). Five stock solutions containing metal MB (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) were prepared separately by dissolving corresponding metal nitrates/chlorides (Mn(NO3)2, FeCl2, Co(NO3)2, Ni(NO3)2, Cu(NO3)2, each at 0.10 M) in the presence of trisodium citrate dihydrate (Na3C6H5O7·2H2O, 0.1125 M) in deionized water to form clear solutions of type B. Afterwards, mixing of solutions of type A and type B were performed in specified volume ratios using the automated liquid-handling system according to the target composition. For instance, for a PBA with composition Mn0.2Ni0.4Cu0.4–Fe0.6Co0.4, the sequence and volume of stock solution addition were as follows: 20 μl Mn(NO3)2, 40 μl Ni(NO3)2, 40 μl Cu(NO3)2, 60 μl K3[Fe(CN)6] and 40 μl K3[Co(CN)6]. The total volume of solutions of type A was 100 μl and the total volume of solutions of type B was also 100 μl—therefore, the total volume of each PBA solution was always 200 μl. After sealing, each 54-vial well plate housing different mixed solutions was shaken for 15 min (250 rpm) and aged at room temperature for 24 h to form PBAs.

For a typical set of styrene epoxidation reactions, the reaction stock solution was prepared as follows: first, styrene (0.50 M) and tert-butyl hydrogen peroxide (0.75 M) were dissolved in 100 ml acetonitrile. Then, 30 ml cetyltrimethylammonium bromide aqueous solution (0.25 M) was added to the mixture. Subsequently, the obtained mixture was sonicated for 5 min to obtain a homogeneous stock solution. Afterwards, the robotic system pipetted 1.3-ml aliquots of the thus prepared stock solution into the vials containing previously prepared PBAs (200 µl aqueous suspension). The reaction vials were then sealed and every reaction plate was placed on a thermal shaker (72 °C, 700 rpm) for 6 h. After reaction, when the PBAs sedimented, the robot acquired 40 µl of the supernatant from every vial, diluted it 1,000 times and then measured the UV-Vis spectrum with the NanoDrop spectrophotometer. The yield of styrene oxide (yso) and benzaldehyde (yalde) for each sample can be obtained by spectral unmixing and the selectivity of styrene, calculated by yso/(yso + yalde) × 100%, was then obtained.

a, Examples of reactions compatible (green background), borderline (yellow) and incompatible (pink) with yield determination using UV-Vis and spectral unmixing. The compatible reactions include but are not limited to Claisen–Schmidt condensation 1, Ullmann-type coupling 2, Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling 3, Cu(I)-catalysed alkyne-azide cycloaddition 4, Friedel–Crafts acylation 5, imine condensation 6, Glaser-type coupling 7 or Beckmann rearrangement 8. The Diels–Alder reaction 9 shown on yellow background is borderline in terms of the quality of unmixing (the overlap of the UV-Vis signals from the product and from dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate prevents accurate fitting, leading to an overestimation of the yield). For the Diels–Alder reaction 10 shown on red background, the band of the product (λmax < 286 nm) is obscured by the toluene solvent (λmax = 286 nm). Other reactions unsuitable for the method are, for example, SN2 reaction of alkyl bromide 11 (not absorbing above 220 nm) or condensation of dichlorodiaminobenzene with phenanthrenequinone 12 (poor solubility of the product). b, R2 = 0.96 correlation between the optically determined yields versus the yields of the same reactions determined by conventional means (HPLC for E1 from Fig. 3 and Ugi-type MCR from Fig. 4; 1H NMR for Claisen–Schmidt condensation 1 and imine condensation 6; the weights of isolated compounds for Cu(I)-catalysed alkyne-azide cycloaddition 4 and Beckmann rearrangement 8). For numerical values of each data point, see Supplementary Tables 5–7 in Supplementary Information Sections 4.3 and 4.4.

a, Taking as an example a basic bimolecular reaction A + B → C (with kinetic rate k[A][B], reaction time t = 1 and kinetic constant k = 1), the plot has the yield and concentration of C for various combinations of A and B substrates. b, The plot shows the yield surface explicitly (black curve is the boundary at which the limiting reactant switches from A to B). As seen, yield—defined with respect to the concentration of the limiting reagent—tends to maximize at the boundaries of the region (orange curve in a) but the concentration of the product tends to maximize in its interior (blue curve in a). There are two implications of this ‘inverse' dependence: (1) yields at very low concentrations may be artificially high, whereas—in reality—they involve very high (wasteful) excesses of some reagents; (2) detecting and quantifying the product reliably may be compromised in such a low-concentration regime. Accordingly, in the current work—especially for the multicomponent mixtures—we have worked over concentration ranges that do not extend to very small values, thereby assuring reliable detection while avoiding highly wasteful excess ratios. Such a ‘practical' range is shown schematically in a by the dashed vertical lines. Another corollary is that discovery of unexpected products may be severely compromised when using a strategy of investigating only the edges and boundaries of an n-dimensional region while leaving the interior unexplored—a strategy that may otherwise seem intuitive to a chemist and has some merit in maximization of the yield of known products. c,d, Comparison of final concentration map (c) to yield map (d) for product 19e in Hantzsch reaction. Note the difference between the conditions that maximize concentration versus ones that maximize yield: yield is maximized at the vertices of the cube, whereas concentration is maximized in the middle of the front face and top edge, with higher concentrations protruding deeper into the interior of the cube (see blue curve in a). The isosurfaces correspond to 5 mM, 10 mM, 15 mM, 20 mM, 25 mM and 30 mM concentrations of 19e in c, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% and 60% yields of 19e in d and are calculated as explained in the caption of Fig. 2c,d.

Experimental (left) and theoretical (right) four-dimensional map of the yield of Ugi multicomponent reaction. Yield is shown by colour and size of spheres. Three-dimensional space coordinates are the starting concentrations of isocyanide, amine and aldehyde. The fourth dimension is the concentration of p-toluenesulfonic acid (indicated above the three-dimensional plots), which keeps increasing as the video plays. Experimental data have been smoothed for this illustration, as described in Supplementary Information Section 3.13. For comparison of the smoothed and raw data, see Supplementary Information Section 4.15.4. Theoretical yield map (right half of the video) corresponds to the kinetic model best fit to the data, as described in Supplementary Information Section 5.3. The same theoretical yields are shown by the blue curves in Supplementary Figs. 116–128 (Supplementary Information Section 4.13.4) for all 3,234 conditions tested in experiments.

YouTube doesn't charge a cent for hosting all of your uploaded videos, showing them to the wider world, or letting you spend all day streaming content made by others. What it does do is show you a whole lot of advertising in an attempt to make back some of its data storage costs—which, based on the flood of ads we all have to endure, are presumably astronomical.

By subscribing to YouTube Premium and now YouTube Premium Lite, you can remove those ads for good, across all your devices. As the cheaper option, the Lite package may seem like the best deal, and it will be for some.

Here's how much you have to pay for YouTube Premium Lite, and what you get in return.

If you're prepared to add yet another digital subscription to your monthly outgoings, YouTube Premium Lite will set you back $8 a month. There's no way to pay annually to get a discount overall, and there's no family plan where you can spread the benefits to other people—two options you do have with the full version of YouTube Premium.

YouTube Premium Lite has one feature: It removes the ads on most YouTube videos, wherever you're watching them (from your phone to your TV). You'll still see ads on music videos, on YouTube Shorts, and when you search for videos on YouTube—but all ad types on other content will disappear.

Your subscription will be linked to your Google account, so it works wherever you're signed in, and it includes YouTube Kids content as well. As it's a monthly subscription, you can cancel at any time, and then subscribe again at any time. You can also upgrade at any time to the full YouTube Premium, of which we'll learn more in a moment.

A lot of us are now juggling multiple digital subscriptions for everything from cloud storage to AI chatbots, and it's understandable if you're not keen on the thought of adding extra expense on top, especially for an app and platform that you can already access free of charge.

Ultimately it comes down to time and money: If you spend a significant amount of time on YouTube, you're going to save a significant amount of time if you don't have any ads to sit through. That's time you could spend doing something else, or just watching more YouTube videos, and those five and 10 second chunks will quickly add up over the course of a week and a month.

I've subscribed to an ad-free YouTube experience on and off in recent years, and am currently signed up for the full YouTube Premium. For me, it makes a big difference not having to watch any ads at all: So much so that it's really jarring when friends show me clips on their phone and we have to wait to get through the ads first.

It also depends what you generally use YouTube for. Remember your music mixes are still going to have ads, so you won't get as much benefit if you're queueing up playlists for social gatherings or background tunes for work and study. Here's an idea: Maybe give it a try for a month, and see how much you like it.

Aside from simply continuing to use YouTube for free as normal, the alternative to YouTube Premium Lite is the full YouTube Premium. It costs substantially more though: For an individual plan it'll set you back $14 per month, or $140 a year ($11.67 a month). You can also choose to pay $23 a month for a family plan, which covers you and five other family members.

You also get a lot more with YouTube Premium. Ads are removed across all video types, you can download videos to watch offline on desktop and mobile, and you get YouTube Music Premium thrown in. If you like YouTube's music streaming service enough, you can cancel Spotify and put the money towards your subscription.

Here you're weighing the same sorts of considerations as you are with YouTube Premium Lite: Whether or not the time you (and maybe the rest of your family) will save sitting through ads is worth the expense. If you're a regular user of YouTube, these subscriptions likely have some serious appeal.

Waymo's ever-expanding robotaxi aspirations have spread to the corporate world. 

The Alphabet-owned self-driving vehicle unit has launched “Waymo for Business,” a new service designed for companies to set up accounts so their employees can access robotaxis in cities like Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco. 

Waymo announced Wednesday in a blog post it is inviting organizations to sign up for Waymo for Business. The new service will let businesses subsidize their employees' rides or purchase promo codes in bulk, which can be handed out to clients, customers, or workers. The Waymo for Business rides will cost the same as its regular service.

One of Waymo's first customers is Carvana, the Phoenix-based online used car marketplace. 

While riders already use Waymo's robotaxis to commute to work, this is the company's first coordinated commercial effort to target corporations and other organizations. Waymo has said nearly one in six of its local riders in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix rely on Waymo to commute to work or school.

Today, users open the Waymo app (or in some cities like Austin, the Uber app) to hail a ride. That process won't change for employees whose companies have signed up for Waymo for Business. What does change is the control companies can exert over the service.

Through the Waymo for Business service, companies have access to a business portal that gives the organizations control over their ride programs. Corporate customers can dictate the geographic area in which their employees use the robotaxis, set pickup and drop-off locations, monitor ride activity, and track their budget.

Waymo said it plans to bring its new business service to other cities like Washington, DC and Miami, once it has launched commercial operations in those markets. Waymo has ramped up operations over the past 18 months making it the dominant robotaxi service provider in the United States. The company has expanded its commercial service from Phoenix to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin, and Atlanta. More cities are slated for 2026.

But it's also sought other means to attract customers beyond expanding its geographic footprint. Waymo has gained access to the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, the San Jose Mineta International Airport, and soon the San Francisco Airport, unlocking a critical service that directly competes with ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft; it has also partnered with public transit services company Via, and even opened its robotaxis to teens (with a parent's account).

I also had previously thought I wasn't that interest in formal proofs because I was never super interested in traditional mathematical proofs, but once I realize formal proofs can be viewed as an extension of type checking it got me a lot more interested!

reply

Lately, I was wondering about if it's possible to represent any logic by choosing a suitable base of combinators, and the sentences in the logic would correspond to beta-normal terms expressed in those combinators. What brought me to the idea is that we can represent certain substructural logics using a subset of B, C, K, W. Also, one can represent classical logic by using a different base than S and K, which allows for call/cc.What would be intriguing, a choice of combinator base such that it could express terms in Church's typed lambda calculus. The composition of combinators would fail to normalize iff the corresponding composed term in typed lambda calculus failed to typecheck.I think this could lead to somewhat simpler foundations of mathematics, instead of having types and various axioms, we would just say here's a base set of combinators and have fun combining them.

The commercial incentive Match Group has to prevent churn means the optimal outcome for them is that you never find a partner. And so if you're outside that top N percentile of popularity, they've optimized their apps to abuse you emotionally and financially. They're engineering the perfect carrot on a stick.One such behaviour, for example, is that when you buy Tinder Plus, they will feed you a couple matches, but withhold more than they give you. Once the subscription expires, they feed you rest of the “Likes You” people into the page where they're obscured, forcing you to resubscribe if you want to see them. And of course you will never encounter those people just by swiping, they're purposefully held from you.I've recently switched to Facebook Dating because they don't have any commercial incentives (and in fact probably negative incentives) to NOT match you. Thus they can also give you all of the “Premium” features for free.What Match Group is doing probably isn't illegal, but I think it probably should be. It's the same kind of emotional manipulation that casinos are guilty of.

Earlier today, Netflix released a featurette for the fifth and final season of Stranger Things. In it, its actors promise fans that the upcoming season will be the most action-packed yet and conclude on a satisfying note, marking the end of one of the streaming platform's most popular television shows.

Although the trailer didn't reveal much about what fans can expect from the upcoming season, as it only included new footage in the final 30 seconds of the polished behind-the-scenes featurette, it did remind viewers of why they love the show and its characters, as well as “the magic of childhood.” The trailer begins with a montage that revisits the humble beginnings of Stranger Things, showcasing many of its young actors, who were just kids at the time. It's amusing to see them now as adults—some are married or can grow facial hair—which highlights just how long the show has been on the air. However, Netflix chose to capitalize on this nostalgia by tapping into a sense of sentimentality, reminding fans of the show's blockbuster debut. 

Laden in interwoven moments from past seasons, David Harbour—an actor who is very ready for the show to be over—spoke highly of the show's pilot episode being pure, and Ryder said the best gift the show gave her was watching stars Finn Wolfhard, Millie Bobby Brown, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp, and Sadie Sink grow up over the years. In a rather unintentionally funny moment, the lighting in the featurette made actor Charlie Heaton look extremely tired as he remarked, “We've been doing it for such a long time.” This sentiment is likely shared by fans, especially with the show's recent batch of releases extending the series and none of its core characters dying over the years. However, the core message of the featurette highlights how the cast has become like a family over the years. By watching their bond grow stronger, it's hoped that viewers will feel a connection and continue to support the series as it moves towards its conclusion.

All that being said, the last couple of seconds, while bereft of anything a normal viewer can string together to suss out what the fifth season of Stranger Things will entail, with a demogorgon chasing the visibly adult kids, the featurette does promise a big finale with beefed-up action and visual effects. Perhaps Millie Bobby Brown put it best:

“It's more of an adventure and more of a mission, which I really like,” Bobby Brown said. “Everybody is really put into the thick of it. No one is sitting back on a walkie-talkie. Everyone is full throttle, going for it.”

Maya Hawke and Wolfhart echoed Bobby Brown's sentiment, saying Stranger Things‘ final season is raising the stakes as its found family fights to the bone, knowing there's a high chance they might not eke out a victory.

“We've come full circle. The fans will be truly satisfied with the ending,” McLaughlin said, closing out the featurette.

Hopefully, Stranger Things 5 will live up to its promise to send its characters off on a high note when the series premieres on Netflix, with its three volumes releasing on November 26, December 25, and the finale on December 31.

When I tried Meta's new Ray-Ban Display—the company's first pair of smart glasses with a screen in them—my first thought was: these are going to be big. And my second thought was: how the hell are these going to work? As great as smart glasses could be for replacing your phone in theory, there are a lot of snags one can encounter on that road to doing so.

One of those snags, for example, is Apple's iOS. In smart glasses with a display, messaging is a major part of the appeal. The ability to quickly see and respond to someone makes them as useful a companion to your phone as a smartwatch, if not more useful. The problem is, not every company we buy gadgets from (ahem, Apple) plays nice. That has meant no real integration between Apple's Messages app in iOS and Ray-Ban Meta AI smart glasses. In short, you can't listen to and respond to text messages on Meta's smart glasses if you're not using WhatsApp. That's also why when I tried the Meta Ray-Ban Display, I was excited by what Meta seemed to be suggesting.

Both in a demo and in its press materials, Meta suggested that you will be able to “privately view and reply to messages in… iOS and Android” with its new display glasses. Finally, right? The one big feature that Ray-Ban Meta AI smart glasses were missing. Except… that may not be true. According to Meta's CTO, Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, who recently held a Q&A on Instagram after Meta Connect, Meta is still shut out from integrating Messages in a real way. Here's what he said:

“Right now it's Messenger and WhatsApp, which obviously are, incredibly popular global messaging platforms. We'd love to expand and do more… So, you know, tell your friendly neighborhood Apple employee to build the right permissions and access.”

That feels like a pretty far cry from being able to “privately view and reply to messages in… iOS and Android.” Gizmodo reached out to Meta for clarification, but I've yet to hear back as of publication. Maybe Boz just means that the Messages app can't work fully on the smart glasses? That's what I'm hoping, at least, but I'm not optimistic that's the case. Current-gen Ray-Bans without a display (the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2) also can't read and reply to messages in iOS or Android, and unless Meta made some breakthrough with Apple and Android, I don't see why the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses would be any different.

It's sounding like Meta Ray-Ban Display could have the same limited messaging functionality as Fitbits and any smartwatches that Wear OS or another software platform. Apple doesn't allow smartwatches that aren't its own Apple Watches to send replies to messages, only receive them via a paired iPhone, and even that's often limited or hit or miss. Though, that may change. iOS 26.1 code (via Macworld) suggests that Apple may add a “Notification Forwarding” feature that would allow notifications, like messages, to show up on third-party smartwatches. There's no mention of allowing replies to iMessages.

The thing is, if Meta's smart glasses can't do any of that stuff, it wouldn't really be its fault. Apple has always been notoriously prickly in giving non-Apple hardware privileges to use its software and features (see every debate over green bubbles for context on that). So, as much as Meta would love to be able to let users of its smart glasses reply to messages sent to them via iOS, it's out of their hands for now. However, it would be Meta's fault for suggesting that its smart glasses can read and reply to iMessages if that's not the case.

Maybe it won't matter in the end—the rest of the world outside of the U.S. uses third-party apps like WhatsApp and WeChat all the time, and they wouldn't think twice about buying a device that lacks iOS or iMessage integration. But, there's also a chance that, to lots of people in the U.S., it would be a big deal, meaning Meta has a massive messaging problem, both literal and figurative. We'll be sure to update you as soon as we know more.

If mixed reality and virtual reality are still a big thing, you wouldn't know it based on Meta's Connect conference last week. There were no big Quest announcements (outside of maybe Hyperscape), no new Quest headset, and it felt like the only time Meta (traditionally the loudest and proudest purveyor of XR out there) really tackled XR and VR was through a surprise, and slightly out of place, fireside chat with… Avatar director, James Cameron.

That would make sense if XR and VR headsets have fallen behind, becoming a victim of a lack of technological advancement or insufficient investment. But the funny thing is, the hardware seems to be more sophisticated than ever. Take Pimax's upcoming Dream Air and Dream Air SE, for example. While the headsets are delayed until December, the specs on them look enticing for VR enthusiasts, to say the least. According to Pimax, its headsets both weigh less than 200 grams, come with micro OLED panels, and the Dream Air will have a 4K resolution in each eye. And that's just the areas that Pimax is competing with other headsets on.

One feature that its headsets will have that no other competitor will is a motorized self-tightening headstrap— totally unnecessary—but is also admittedly pretty damn cool. And this thing will automatically adjust the lenses to match your vision, so you don't have to screw around manually adjusting IPD settings and whatnot. I have no idea how either of these features works since I haven't used the Dream Air line at all, but just their existence says to me that VR and XR headsets clearly have more to offer innovation-wise.

And Pimax isn't the only one pushing forward in the category: Samsung appears to be on the precipice of releasing its Project Moohan XR headset, a competitor to Apple's Vision Pro that should deliver displays that are equally as premium and a UI that might be just as intuitive in a package that (hopefully) costs a lot less than $3,500. And that's not even accounting for a rumored upcoming version of the Vision Pro, which may knock down the price and feature an even more powerful chip.

There's clearly progress in the pipeline, and potentially substantial progress, but excitement over that progress doesn't seem to match up. For the third consecutive year, sales of VR headsets declined in 2024, even with Apple's entry into the XR scene and the release of Meta's very affordable Quest 3S headset that does most of what the Quest 3 does for just $299. In May, Meta, the biggest player in the space, saw its Reality Labs revenue decline 6% because of waning Quest sales. The point is, people aren't buying headsets even if they're nicer than they ever were.

In one way, I get it. While the Pimax Dream Air headsets are light, they're also tethered to a PC, which isn't exactly the most immersive experience one could have in VR.  And the Vision Pro? Well, no tether there, but it's heavy and expensive. Plus, there's an external battery pack, which feels like its own kind of tether in a way, since you have to carry that around while you're groping the air in XR. Even the Quest 3S, which is a great middle ground of weight, capability, and a truly unbeatable price, struggles with the inherent obstacles of wearing a big headset on your face—you get sweaty, hot, and your head comes out looking like you've been snorkeling for the last hour.

As great as XR and VR experiences are, they're still niche for lots of those reasons and more, and those downsides might feel even more stark when you compare them to emerging devices like smart glasses. I just got a chance to try Meta's Ray-Ban Display, and the appeal is immediate. They're a reasonable weight, they do useful stuff like messaging and navigation, and they come with Meta's Neural Band that makes navigating the UI intuitive. Sure, they're nowhere near the capability of a full VR or XR headset, and the price is still high ($800), but the benefits to owning a pair are clear right out of the gate.

I'm not willing to put the proverbial nail in XR and VR headsets' coffin just yet. They'll have a time and place as long as we're still struggling to miniaturize AR into a device that doesn't weigh our heads down, which could be quite a while. But maybe headsets are a lot more niche than we expected, and maybe no matter how bright and clear we make the screens or how seamless the UI is, they're still just a bridge to something smaller, lighter, and more Ray-Ban-like.

 September 24, 2025  

VIENNA — A new draft consensus report from the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) updates the 2021 guidance on managing type 1 diabetes (T1D) in adults, with revisions to diagnostic criteria, recommendations on diabetes technology, and strategies for addressing obesity.

Anne L. Peters, MD, and Richard I.G. Holt, MD, co-chairs of the writing panel, presented an overview of the proposed draft at European Association for the Study of Diabetes (E ASD) 2025 Annual Meeting. The document was posted online and is open for feedback until 11:59 PM Eastern US time October 16, 2025.

“We want everybody to send comments, to get as large and wide input as we can, because this is about people and their lives,” Peters, professor of clinical medicine at Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, told Medscape Medical News.

The 2021 report, the first to focus specifically on T1D in adults, has been cited over 1000 times and has substantially influenced clinical practice, said Holt, professor in diabetes and endocrinology human development and health faculty of medicine at the University of Southampton, Southampton, England.

“Reflecting the rapid advances in the field, all sections have been updated to account for novel therapies, interventions to delay disease onset, and the integration of new technologies,” the draft authors wrote.

Three new sections — on screening for microvascular complications, cardiovascular (CV) risk management, and management of obesity — have been added, Hold noted. Other sections have been amalgamated and key points added.

The section on diagnosis of T1D was the most challenging for the panel because the differences from T2D or monogenetic types often aren't clear in adults, Peters told Medscape Medical News. “Kids are easy, adults are hard,” she noted.

The newly proposed diagnostic algorithm advises consideration of T1D in adults younger than 35 years, with BMI < 25 or unintentional weight loss, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or glucose > 20 mmol/L (360 mg/dL), rapid progression to insulin therapy, or just uncertainty about the diabetes type. For any of these, the recommendation is to test at least one autoantibody, glutamic acid decarboxylase, followed by islet antigen 2 (IA-2) and zinc transporter 8 when needed and available.

For individuals who are IAb negative or who have a single low titer of IAb positivity, consideration of C-peptide measurement is recommended. If < 200 pmol/L or 0.6 ng/mL, the diagnosis is T1D. However, a higher C-peptide level doesn't necessarily exclude T1D, Holt said.

Genetic testing for monogenetic diabetes should be considered for those younger than 35 years with C-peptide levels > 200 pmol/L, while those with C-peptide > 600 pmol/L who have typical features of T2D should be given that diagnosis unless they progress rapidly to insulin, in which case C-peptide testing should be repeated and T1D considered.

In those for whom the diagnosis still isn't clear, an initial trial of noninsulin therapy may be appropriate, with close supervision and repeat C-peptide measurement at a later time, Holt outlined.

Those with T1D who have glycemic levels in target range and acceptable well-being may need minimal intervention. Others, however, may have a variety of challenges including frequent low or high blood sugars, a desire to change treatment, diabetes distress, depression, eating disorder, or other psychological issues.

The report gives detailed information about insulin adjustment, device use, diet, exercise, and referral to mental health professionals. Diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) is recommended for everyone with T1D. “We want to get providers to think about this really holistic way of looking at somebody who comes to clinic with their [T1D],” Peters said.

The use of DSMES is particularly helpful at critical times such as diagnosis, annually and/or when not meeting treatment targets, when complications develop, or when transitions in life or care occur, she said.

The section on nutrition emphasizes individualization based on the person's preferences and needs and the impact of meal composition on glucose levels. The use of low or very-low carbohydrate diets may be acceptable as long as they are also part of healthy eating patterns. The use of technologies such as phone apps, bolus calculators, and artificial intelligence to evaluate meal composition are also covered.

Physical activity is encouraged unless contraindicated, with guidance around the effects of various types of exercise on glucose levels, with suggestions on how to use diabetes technology to optimize glucose levels around exercise.

The report also goes over other health-related behaviors including sleep, alcohol and drug use, and smoking cessation, along with preparing for travel, driving, and occupational support. A section devoted to psychosocial care advises screening for mental health and social determinants of health using validated questionnaires, and inclusion of a mental health professional in the care team.

“First and foremost, we are big believers that people with [T1D] should have real-time access to information about their glucose levels and trends, with warning alarms and alerts, which means we think everybody with T1D should have CGM [continuous glucose monitoring] available as the standard of care for glucose monitoring,” Peters said, adding that access to fingerstick monitoring is also necessary for the times when CGM isn't available or isn't functioning properly.

Recommended glucose targets for CGM haven't changed since the last statement, she noted.

Automated insulin delivery systems (AIDs), comprising a CGM, pump, and algorithm connecting the two, are the preferred mode of insulin delivery in T1D due to improved glucose control, reduction in hypoglycemia, and improved quality of life. But if injections are used, they should be given as multiple daily injections of a basal insulin with premeal boluses using analog insulins. Inhaled insulin can be used for meal boluses.

There is insufficient evidence to recommend use of adjunctive therapies in T1D to improve glycemia, although such off-label use is increasing, said Peters. The risks and benefits of these should be discussed with each individual.

Patients should be assessed for hypoglycemic awareness using validated questionnaires, and use of CGM among the measures for prevention of severe hypoglycemia. The prevention of DKA includes DSMES, awareness of “sick day rules,” and ketone monitoring.

The report also covers new and evolving approaches to preservation and replacement of beta cell function, including disease-modifying immune therapies, and islet cell transplantation. Those topics, discussed in separate sections in the previous T1D guidance, have been merged into a single section because “the number of people who are now needing to have transplantation has gone down because the technology is now working so much better,” Holt told Medscape Medical News.

Recommendations on screening for retinopathy, neuropathy, and kidney disease haven't changed but weren't included in the previous T1D guidance because they don't differ significantly from those for T2D. But many people said they wanted that information in this guideline “so we listened,” Holt noted.

In some cases, the recommended frequency of such complications screening has been loosened, he said.

Similarly, CV risk management recommendations aren't new and include a blood pressure target of < 120/80 mm Hg, statins for those aged 40 years or older or aged 20-39 at higher CV risk. The report includes a detailed discussion about adjunctive use of GLP-1 receptor agonist (RA) and SGLT2 inhibitor drugs for CV risk management, separately from glycemic management.

Holt pointed out that overweight and obesity are at least as common in T1D as in the general population, with additional contributors in T1D including increased food intake to combat hypoglycemia, and the effects of hyperinsulinemia. But the treatments are the same as for obesity overall, including behavioral interventions, pharmacotherapy including GLP-1 RAs, and bariatric surgery if indicated.

A section on older people with T1D emphasizes patient safety, particularly avoidance of hypoglycemia, as a key priority, with targets based on functional/cognitive status, available care partner support, history of hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia awareness, and life expectancy. Technology should not be discontinued or excluded due to older age alone. Simplification of insulin regimens should be considered if the current regimen becomes difficult.

“The good news is that all of us who've been in practice long enough are seeing our patients grow to be old, but as people age, there are all sorts of different requirements. I think it's important that we're all aware of this,” Peters said. “Remember, many of these people have had T1D for their whole lives, since they were children. You really want to work with them to do this in a way that is safe and effective and meets their own level of need.”

Pregnancy is addressed only briefly in this document because it is the subject of separate guidelines. But there is discussion of prepregnancy glycemic targets, referral to clinics with expertise in diabetic pregnancy management, and use of technology before, during, and after pregnancy.

In-hospital management guidance includes the importance of avoiding both hypoglycemia and DKA, and the use of technology. Noncritically ill patients using diabetes devices should be allowed to continue using them in the hospital when possible.

During the discussion period, Thomas Danne, MD, Chief Medical Officer, International, of Breakthrough T1D, said that he would like to see stronger recommendations for use of adjunctive therapies, particularly SGLT2 inhibitors, in adults with T1D. “I think it's important to state right now that SGLT2s can improve metabolic control and very likely reduce cardiovascular risk. People with T1D have the highest cardiovascular risk of all,” he told Medscape Medical News.

Danne also said he didn't see enough about the system of care generally that needs to be in place to treat T1D. Discussing diagnosis was useful, he said, but we need a change in available care. “The biggest problem is we have only 30% of the American population with T1D on diabetes technology and AIDs are far behind.” 

Peters said that the writing panel is looking specifically for feedback on the updated algorithm for diagnosing T1D in adults, and on the new sections on obesity, management of CV risk factors, and screening and detection of microvascular complications.

“We want you to tell us exactly what we've got right and wrong. You can tell us we did a good job…but I doubt that's going to be the bulk of the comments.” 

Holt reported receiving speaker honoraria from Eli Lilly. Peters reported serving on the advisory board for Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Medscape and receiving research support from Abbott Diabetes Care, Insulet, and Zucara. She reported holding stock options from Omada Health. Danne reported being an employee of Breakthrough T1D, with no further disclosures.

Children whose mothers adhered more closely to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) during pregnancy and breastfeeding, particularly when mothers consumed higher amounts of full-fat dairy products, fruits, and vegetables, were less likely to develop food allergies.

“The results of [the] study suggest that emphasizing specific food groups in the MedDiet may enhance its protective effects against allergies,” the authors of the study wrote.

Emilia Vassilopoulou, MD, with International Hellenic University, Thessaloniki, Greece, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on September 13, 2025, in Allergy.

The retrospective design, observational nature, reliance on maternal recall regarding diet during pregnancy and breastfeeding, unbalanced ratio of food allergy cases to control individuals, and high baseline intake of certain MedDiet components in the Greek population may have limited the generalizability.

Two authors reported receiving grants, research funding, and consultancy/lecture fees and serving as advisors on scientific projects of various pharmaceutical companies.

FILE - Members of the Afghan women's football team attend Morocco's practice ahead of the Women's World Cup in Melbourne, Australia, Wednesday, July 19, 2023.

ZURICH (AP) — The Afghanistan national women's soccer team of refugee players has its first official games next month at a four-team tournament in Dubai, FIFA said Wednesday.

The FIFA-supported team — which cannot yet officially represent Afghanistan in World Cup qualifying — will face the host United Arab Emirates, Chad and Libya in the Oct. 23-29 event.

Afghanistan has not played an official women's competitive game since 2018, and the return to power of the Taliban regime in 2021 shut down women's sport. The Afghan soccer federation has obligations under FIFA statutes to avoid discrimination though has not been suspended from international soccer.

The tournament “reinforces FIFA's efforts to promote and protect the right of all women and girls to play the sport, pursue their footballing dreams and thrive through the game,” the soccer body said.

The women's teams of Chad and Libya do not yet have a FIFA ranking, and the UAE is No. 117.

FIFA said all games at the round-robin tournament will be broadcast live on its in-house streaming platform.

...

Seven games into the new season, Chelsea are not where they would want to be.

The Blues sit sixth in the Premier League table, having won just two of their opening five league games.

But why has the start to the season been worse than many would have expected? Can it all be blamed on the Club World Cup, or is there more to it?

Chelsea were one of only two Premier League clubs, alongside Manchester City, who were present at FIFA's revamped Club Wold Cup tournament in the USA over the summer.

It meant that while the other 18 Premier League clubs, including the Blues' competitors such as Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham were able to have at least six weeks off, Enzo Maresca and his players were only able to take two weeks off after the tournament, and only returned to training a couple of weeks before the Premier League started.

They did, of course, win the tournament, beating PSG 3-0 in style, which would have gone some way to making up for the burden of the event, but the physical strain on the players cannot be underestimated.

That strain has been shown by Chelsea's early injuries.

Levi Colwill picked up an ACL injury only days after Chelsea began training for the new season. The English centre-half played 38 games for Chelsea last term, then flew out with England for a camp and two games, before going straight to the FIFA tournament and playing five games there.

Cole Palmer, Chelsea's best and most important player, has had issues with a groin injury since the season began. The forward started the opening league game against Crystal Palace, before missing two games and returning against Brentford. He played in that game and against Bayern Munich in the Champions League, but was taken off after 20 minutes against Manchester United because of the persistent problem.

Palmer played 52 times for Chelsea last campaign, including the Club World Cup. It cannot be purely coincidental that Colwill and Palmer – two players who played among the most minutes in the squad – have now picked up serious injuries.

Colwill is Chelsea's best centre-back and a huge defensive miss, but if Palmer is to miss large parts of the season he is almost irreplaceable. He scored 18 goals and registered 13 assists last term.

And it's not just those two. Dario Essugo, Benoit Badiashile, Romeo Lavia and Liam Delap are all players who played in the summer tournament and now find themselves injured.

Despite clear issues that have arisen as a result of the heavy workload on the players, not all of Chelsea's shortcomings can be attributed to that.

On paper, the Blues had a very favourable start to the season. Crystal Palace, West Ham, Fulham and Brentford as the first four league games.

To take eight points from those games is a disappointment. Chelsea would have expected to beat Palace at home, and they would also expect to beat 17th place Brentford, who have lost their two best players and their manager.

It's not only the results that were disappointing but the performances were too. Chelsea were lacklustre against Palace, could and perhaps should have gone behind against Fulham, and were sloppy and defensively poor against Brentford.

The Brentford game was four days before Chelsea's trip to the Allianz Arena, and Enzo Maresca opted for an experimental side. Jamie Gittens and Facundo Buonanotte started, whilst Jorrel Hato debuted in defence, and looked overwhelmed.

The game required the late substitutions of Palmer and Alejandro Garnacho to see Chelsea score twice, and they still conceded in the last minute.

Fans were curious as to why Maresca chose to give two players their full debuts, Buonanotte and Hato, a decision which backfired.

And things seem to have gone downhill since that last minute equaliser that Brentford's Fabio Carvalho inflicted on them.

They were well beaten against Bayern Munich before disaster struck against Manchester United.

Robert Sanchez's daft decision to take out Bryan Mbeumo in the fifth minute and reduce the Blues to ten men was costly, but so were Maresca's ensuing decisions.

The Italian made three substitutions immediately following the red card. Palmer was an enforced one, but Estevao and Pedro Neto were also taken off. Three forward players left the pitch, and no forward players came on, leaving only one attacker, Joao Pedro, on the pitch.

Fans were baffled at Maresca's defensive substitutions, and United scored twice before the end of the first half anyway. Chelsea eventually got one back in the 80th minute, but it was too little, too late.

Maresca said after the game: “All the game changed after the red card, all the planning and everything, it doesn't exist anymore.”

While that might be true, part of a manager's job is to be reactive to in-game events. Those quotes, and Maresca's substitutions, were concerning.

After three games without a win and in need of some positivity, a Carabao Cup game against League One side Lincoln City seemed timely.

Maresca fielded a fairly strong side with several regulars starting. Chelsea prevailed 2-1, but Lincoln were the better team in the first half and went ahead in the game. It took a brilliant strike from George and a first goal from Buonanotte for the Blues to avoid a Manchester United v Grimsby style embarrassment.

Chelsea's transfer strategy is something that predates Maresca and was implemented when Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital took control of the club in May 2022.

The ownership and sporting directors have always had a youth-led approach in the transfer market, aiming to sign the best young talent from around the world before they become renowned stars.

The strategy made sense in the early years. Chelsea had an ageing squad and players like Jorginho, Cesar Azpilicueta, Antonio Rudiger and many others needed replacing.

There was also a period of grace for the new owners and sporting directors. They had to get their feet under the table and work things out.

Failed transfers like Mykhailo Mudryk, Joao Felix, Axel Disasi, Badiashile and others were to be anticipated. But with investment comes expectation.

Now the ownership have been in place for three years and spent £1.5 billion. So rightly, the expectations for the club have increased. While they have had some success, winning the Conference League, Club World Cup and qualifying for the Champions League last season, fans expect a Premier League title challenging team. Not necessarily title winning, but title challenging.

Chelsea made some questionable decisions this summer. Letting go of Noni Madueke and signing Gittens and Garnacho does not appear an improvement.

Hato may become a brilliant defender. But he is not currently, and so does not make a massive impact on Chelsea's hopes in the immediate future.

After Colwill got injured, Maresca emphasised the need for a new centre-back signing. There was still almost a month left of the window but nothing was done.

So is it any surprise that with mounting injuries and young players such as Gittens and Hato who do not seem ready, as yet, for the top level of the Premier League, Chelsea are having a mixed season so far?

Maresca will no doubt to continue to carefully manage his squad to try to avoid injuries, but he must hope his young signings can quickly reach the level required if squad rotation is not to hamper the team too much.

Chelsea will have minimum expectations of qualifying for the knockout rounds of the Champions League and at the very least finishing in the top four. A domestic cup win would help matters but overall, there has to be clear signs of progress towards become a title contending team.

The transfer strategy has to change, that is clear. Chelsea need world-class players, not potentially world-class players. But they may have to endure an underwhelming season before they get another go at improving.","{'href': 'https://ca.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}","soccer"

FIFA held discussions on Tuesday about expanding the men's World Cup to a 64-team tournament in 2030 after receiving a formal pitch from a delegation of influential South American leaders.

The group included heads of state from Paraguay and Uruguay, as well as senior football executives from the South American confederation CONMEBOL and the head of the Argentine Football Association (AFA).

During meetings at FIFA's New York City headquarters inside Trump Tower, the FIFA president Gianni Infantino and general secretary Mattias Grafstrom received a number of politicians and football executives from Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay.

Alejandro Dominguez, president of South America's CONMEBOL federation and FIFA vice-president, led the discussions on behalf of the visiting delegation. He was joined by national president Santiago Pena of Paraguay and Yamandu Orsi of Uruguay. AFA chief Chiqui Tapia and his Paraguay and Uruguay counterparts, Robert Harrison and Nacho Alonso, were also present.

Argentina's head of state, Javier Milei, was not in attendance, as he was occupied by a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump amid economic turmoil in Argentina. Further meetings related to the 2030 World Cup are scheduled for this week.

The 64-team idea was first presented by the Uruguayan Football Association's president, Ignacio Alonso, during a FIFA Council meeting in March, according to The New York Times. The proposal surprised many on the call, but FIFA says it has a duty to consider ideas presented at its Council. In April, Dominguez pitched the idea to CONMEBOL's congress. He said the 64-team concept would be a one-off to mark the 100th anniversary of the first men's World Cup, which took place in Uruguay in 1930.

At the FIFA Congress in May, held in Paraguay, Dominguez urged FIFA to think about a unique approach for the centenary World Cup. He compared how a person might celebrate a 49th or 51st birthday differently from a 50th, saying dispensation should be made for special events.

“I would like to invite you to reflect together so we can do something that the world is waiting for, that the football community deserves. It is what football teaches us — to play as a team,” Dominguez said.

“I want to underline the words of Alejandro. He told all of us to think on how we can really celebrate it in the way it deserves to be celebrated. So every idea is a good idea,” Infantino said at the same Congress.

Grafstrom told reporters at the FIFA Congress that the presidents of CONMEBOL and FIFA “posed an open question about the Centenary World Cup.”

“All ideas are welcome, but no specific ideas have been discussed,” the FIFA general secretary said.

The tournament has grown in size in recent decades, having gone from 16 to 24 teams in 1982, then increasing to the 32-nation format in 1998, before becoming a 48-team competition for next summer's World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.

A 64-team competition would mean more than 30 per cent of FIFA 211 national teams would compete.

The idea has drawn opposition. UEFA president and FIFA vice-president Aleksander Ceferin described it as a “bad idea”, saying it would be damaging for the tournament but also for its impact on the qualification stage, which would have further reduced jeopardy.

CONCACAF president Victor Montagliani, a FIFA vice-president, expressed his opposition to the idea, saying: “It's not a great idea. We haven't even kicked the ball for the 48 (team format), and obviously they can study all they want, but it just doesn't feel right.”

Any decision to expand the tournament will need to be debated and approved by the FIFA Council.

The 2030 tournament is FIFA's most sprawling to date, as it will be hosted across three continents and six countries. It is set to be shared across Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina, who will each have one game at the start of the event, before the remainder of the schedule is split across Spain, Portugal and Morocco.

This workaround, however, has been deemed insufficient by the South Americans. Their continent has hosted only one recent men's World Cup, when Brazil was awarded the 2014 competition. The most recent before that was in Argentina in 1978. In the intervening years, Europe has hosted five tournaments, while Asia has hosted two.

CONMBEOL's minimal involvement in the 2030 competition has the potential to lock them out of the 2034 and 2038 World Cups due to FIFA's confederation rotation principle, which means a confederation must allow two World Cups to pass before it can once again be a host. It remains to be seen how stringently this is applied as World Cups become larger and cast across more countries and continents.

The six-nation, three-continent tournament for 2030 was perceived by many as being a useful outcome for Saudi Arabia, which secured a clear path to 2034 as three confederations (UEFA, CONMEBOL and CAF) were locked out by hosting 2030, while CONCACAF nations were unable to bid for 2034 due to hosting the North American World Cup in 2026.

However, the South Americans have now alighted upon their idea to convince FIFA to expand the 2030 edition to 64 teams. Multiple people close to the discussions, all of whom wished to remain anonymous to protect relationships, confirmed the idea was formally pushed during meetings in Trump Tower on Tuesday. The precise details of a 64-team format remain to be confirmed, but in the meeting, Dominguez suggested that Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay could all host a group each within the competition.

Those present posted small snippets of the meeting on Instagram Tuesday night.

Dominguez, in a video released on his account, said: “It cannot pass by as just another event, it cannot be a normal World Cup. We see this as a once-in-a-100 year opportunity.”

He posted a video from the streets of Manhattan where he said he was entering a “super-important” meeting and said he hoped to emerge with news that could impact the football world.

Pena, Paraguay's president, later posted a video, in which he is shown in the meeting saying: “We want to challenge ourselves. Encourage us to dream and dream big. I say it with great humility but huge responsibility: Paraguay stands ready. It wants to be a protagonist.”

Infantino, in the same video, appears to give encouragement. He tells the room: “Today, we really start working together as a team to make history. Working together to see how we can do something the world will not forget, because the people deserve it.”

When asked by The Athletic about Tuesday's meetings, FIFA referred to its position in March, where it said it had a duty to analyze any proposal made at a FIFA Council meeting.

World Cup 2026

Countdown

Many things spiral with time. Families of mice. Conspiracy theories. Candyfloss. The passing of the years. Now, add the FIFA World Cup to that list.

On Tuesday evening, The Athletic reported football's world governing body had held discussions about expanding the men's World Cup to 64 teams in 2030, having received a formal pitch from influential South American leaders that day.

The first 48-team tournament takes place in North America next summer.

Could a 64-team tournament really happen? The speed of the promised expansion feels scarcely believable. But several high-profile figures are serious about making it happen.

The Athletic explains what we know.

On Tuesday, multiple senior figures from South American football travelled to Trump Tower, home of FIFA's New York City headquarters, for a formal meeting with the sport's global governing body.

CONMEBOL president Alejandro Dominguez, who also serves as FIFA vice-president, described it on social media as a “super-important” gathering, from which he hoped to emerge with news that could change football.

On the agenda? Expansion — an idea first mooted in March, when the New York Times reported Uruguay Football Association president Ignacio Alonso had suggested the notion during the “any other business” section of a FIFA council meeting that month.

In a response at the time, a FIFA spokesperson confirmed the proposal was “spontaneously raised by a FIFA council member” near the end of the meeting.

With discussions continuing at CONMEBOL's own congress in April, Tuesday's meeting was the South American federation's opportunity to formally pitch its idea to FIFA, marketed as a one-off expansion to mark the 100th anniversary of the first World Cup, held in Uruguay in 1930.

Present at the meeting were Dominguez, the chiefs of the Argentine, Paraguayan, and Uruguayan FAs, and two heads of state — Paraguayan president Santiago Pena and Uruguayan president Yamandu Orsi.

Javier Milei, Argentina's president, had also been invited, but instead spent the day meeting with United States president Donald Trump, as Argentina struggles with a rapidly escalating economic crisis. The treasurer of the Argentine FA criticised Milei for his absence on social media, accusing him of “hating football” and “turning his back” on the continent's efforts.

Had Milei attended, he would have been met by the two most powerful men in FIFA — president Gianni Infantino and general secretary Mattias Grafstrom.

“All ideas are welcome, but no specific ideas have been discussed,” Grafstrom told reporters at the FIFA congress in May. But that discussion has now taken place.

“It cannot pass by as just another event, it cannot be a normal World Cup,” Dominguez argued on social media before the meeting. “We see this as a once-in-a-100-year opportunity.”

Let's slow this down. How revolutionary would this expansion really be? Having increased from 16 to 24 teams in 1982, before adopting its 32-nation structure in 1998, the proposed expansion would see the tournament doubling in size over just eight years.

Thirty-two teams in 2022. Forty-eight teams in 2026. Sixty-four teams in 2030.

The 2026 World Cup, hosted across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, is already set to feature a record 104 games — a 64-team tournament would mean that over 30 per cent of FIFA's member nations were competing.

The 2030 edition is set to take place over the largest global area in tournament history — primary hosting duties are to be shared by Spain, Portugal, and Morocco, and the centenary celebrations will see group-stage games hosted by Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.

Those South American nations, however, want more…

The answer to the first part is simple. CONMEBOL and its member nations are driving this idea. Currently, up to seven of South America's 10 sides can qualify for next year's World Cup.

FIFA's hosting stipulations dictate that a continent can only stage the World Cup once every three editions. So by hosting just three games in 2030, South America would be locked out from hosting duties until at least 2042.

This would mean the football-crazed continent would primarily host just one World Cup (Brazil in 2014) in 64 years.

Under CONMEBOL's proposals, a 64-team World Cup would see far more group-stage games held across the continent in 2030 — it has been mooted that Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay could each host an entire group.

FIFA officials are always at pains to stress that they represent all 211 member nations, not just the 50 or so nations that are semi-regular competitors at the World Cup. By expanding the tournament to 64 teams, half of its members would have realistic hopes of competing.

Line up and wait your turn. The unanimous fervour of South America has not been reflected across the rest of the footballing world.

UEFA president and FIFA vice-president Aleksander Ceferin outlined his opposition back in April — a position that is not said to have altered over the past five months.

“This proposal was maybe even more surprising for me than you,” he told reporters at UEFA's annual meeting in Serbia. “It is a bad idea. It is not a good idea for the World Cup itself and it's not a good idea for our qualifiers as well.”

His North American counterpart, CONCACAF president Victor Montagliani, holds a similar view, believing the proposed expansion would be moving too quickly.

“It's not a great idea,” he said. “We haven't even kicked the ball for the 48-team format. They can study all they want, but it just doesn't feel right.”

One issue is whether the on-field product would be harmed by the vast disparities between the tournament's top teams and its worst.

For example, according to the FIFA rankings, the 64th-ranked team in the world is Burkina Faso, a nation that has never reached the World Cup or won the Africa Cup of Nations, and in the last two months has lost to Tanzania (107th), Madagascar (108th), and Mauritania (110th).

Aside from the fan experience, competitiveness issues would have major knock-on effects for TV rights, FIFA's biggest earner from the tournament. Group games comprise the bulk of the tournament — for example, under the 48-team format, 72 of the 104 matches (69.2 per cent) would be group-stage fixtures. Under the likely 64-team format, that would rise to 96 of 128 matches — 75 per cent.

Should they be uncompetitive, both broadcasting companies and FIFA could be left unsatisfied by the competition's offering.

Major associations have expressed doubts, too. One CEO, speaking anonymously to protect relationships, raised the issue of economics — that multiple nations rely on the broadcasting rights of qualifiers to fund their operations between World Cup cycles. Should qualification be devalued by an expanded tournament, the knock-on effect is that these countries would face funding issues — a matter made more complex by the fact that deals are negotiated well before formats are finalised.

And finally, the proposal is likely to garner even more criticism from environmental activists, who have already condemned the decision to hold the 2030 tournament across three tournaments. They say it breaches FIFA's commitment to net-zero emissions by 2040, and to halve them by 2030.

Owing to the travel and logistics, the 2030 tournament is already set to have the largest carbon footprint of any World Cup in history. Tournament expansion would increase that figure.

Well, there are far more questions than answers. For example, with at least six South American teams already qualifying in 2026, it is unclear whether CONMEBOL are pushing for every nation in the confederation to play in 2030.

Please welcome Bolivia, currently ranked 77th in the world, for their first appearance since 1994.

Qualification would be relatively simple for larger confederations such as UEFA and CAF — simply put, it would be the same process, with the top three finishers qualifying rather than the top two, for example — but the exact numbers that each continent would receive could be contentious.

For example, under the 48-team format, a maximum of seven CONMEBOL teams can qualify to the AFC's nine — but that represents a potential 70 per cent of South American sides to 19 per cent of Asia's. Where should the extra slots be allocated?

Again, the process is too early to draw firm conclusions — but in many ways, despite its size, 64 is a less unwieldy number than 48.

Next year's structure is messy. Comprising 12 groups of four, the top two teams from each group will progress, plus the eight best third-place teams, forming a round of 32. Under a 64-team format, the need for lucky losers could be eliminated — there could be 16 groups of four, with the top two going straight through into the knockout stages.

But there are very few 64-team tournaments — the NCAA basketball tournament is one of the only major examples — with one reason being the essential randomness of extended knockout stages. The format is more liable to seeing major sides knocked out early — and without blue riband fixtures, the value of TV deals may take another knock.

In a video posted by Paraguayan president Pena, Infantino appeared to encourage his South American visitors.

“Today, we really start working together as a team to make history,” he told the room. “Working together to see how we can do something the world will not forget, because the people deserve it.”

Responding to questions from The Athletic on Tuesday, a FIFA spokesperson played down the notion that any decision had been made, stating that the body had a duty to analyse any serious proposal made by member nations. Any expansion would need to be debated and approved by the FIFA council, which meets at least twice each year.

As it makes this decision, FIFA is effectively on its own timeline, despite the invariable pressure from nations on both sides of the debate.

It would make sense to monitor the competitiveness of next year's 48-team World Cup — and if the qualification format needs to wait until after that tournament to be finalised, it is to FIFA's benefit that an expanded competition would likely lead to an expedited qualification process. Not for the first time, the only logic that matters is FIFA's.

Race Recap: Azerbaijan

€1 million euros will be up for grabs in Formula 3 moving forward, as the championship sets out a new dedicated driver prize pot.

Formula 3 has announced that a prize fund will be awarded to the best finishers in the Drivers' Championship from the 2025 season onwards.

The €1 million fund will be split between the five highest-placed drivers in the standings and go towards a Formula 2 campaign the following season.

The champion will receive 300,000 euros, second place will get 250,000 euros, with 200,000, 150,000 and 100,000 euros going to the third, fourth and fifth-placed drivers respectively.

Rafael Camara secured the 2025 title with TRIDENT and is set to become the first recipient of the top prize fund.

Nikola Tsolov, Mari Boya, Tim Tramnitz and Martinius Stenshorne followed in second to fifth places, with Tsolov already confirmed to graduate to F2 next season with Campos Racing.

Should any driver not race in F2 in 2026, the prize money would go to the next-best driver in the standings.

Formula 1 President and CEO Stefano Domenicali said: “The Formula 3 one-million-euro prize fund is an important initiative that will further incentivise drivers and provide them with a very valuable and well-deserved reward for their success in the championship.

“The FIA Formula 3 Championship continues to be a vital part of the pyramid system, which provides the drivers with the essential technical, physical, and mental training to rise through the championships on their journey to the highest level of our sport.

“We all look forward to the 2026 season and watching the incredible talent on track.”

FIA Formula 3 CEO Bruno Michel added: “I am pleased to announce this million-euro fund, which will benefit the five highest-placed Formula 3 drivers, alongside the substantial prize offered by our partner, Pirelli, which goes to the champion.

“It is vital to support emerging talent on their road to Formula 1. Formula 3 is a fantastic training ground for these young racers to hone their skills to move up the pyramid, and this additional financial reward will help them to go even further in their efforts towards the pinnacle of motorsport.”

Race Recap: Azerbaijan

Yuki Tsunoda enjoyed his strongest weekend so far as a Red Bull driver at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, with the Japanese driver also trying to support team mate Max Verstappen's championship bid along the way.

Yuki Tsunoda has explained how he opted not to attack Liam Lawson as much in the fight for fifth during the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, in order to support Red Bull team mate Max Verstappen's title chances by not giving an opportunity to McLaren's Lando Norris behind in seventh.

After lining up in P6 on the grid – his best Qualifying result as a Red Bull driver – Tsunoda made a clean start and held off any potential challenge from Norris in the early stages. As the race progressed, the Japanese driver found himself on the tail of Lawson in the Racing Bulls car, whilst still keeping Norris at bay.

The trio ultimately crossed the line with Lawson in fifth from Tsunoda in sixth – the margin standing at just over half a second – and Norris in seventh.

However, speaking during F1 TV's post-race show later on, Tsunoda suggested there were potentially opportunities for him to overtake Lawson but that he felt it was safer not to do so, meaning that it did not present a chance for Norris to capitalise – a move that would have allowed the Briton to gain further points on Verstappen in the championship fight.

“I enjoyed the first stint, for sure,” Tsunoda reflected on his afternoon in Baku, a race that was comfortably won by Verstappen. “The second stint was also very hard for me, especially with McLaren behind and thinking about [the] championship, both Teams' and Drivers' Championship for Max.

“There were a lot of opportunities I could probably go [down the] inside and attack Liam, but there is a lot more risk that maybe McLaren will overtake both of us or [pass Liam], which he will step up one more [position].

“I think as a Red Bull you don't want to have that, and I think I did the right decision not challenging him. But at the same time, I didn't have enough pace to overtake comfortably.”

While Saturday's Qualifying session proved to be one of the most eventful in recent history – amid a record six red flags throughout – Sunday's race did not feature as many incidents. Asked if conditions had felt different – particularly in terms of the wind gusts at the track – Tsunoda responded: “It's a lot different to yesterday, for sure.

“I was hoping to not have a Safety Car with my strategy, especially in the beginning, and I was more hoping towards the end that [there might be] a Safety Car. [I] was a bit surprised.

“I think last year as well, we didn't have much Safety Car [deployment] and I think drivers started to get used to it, and I think it shows how the level is very high in this current Formula 1 grid. With that, I enjoyed it.”

With his P6 marking his strongest outing since his promotion to the main Red Bull team ahead of Round 3 in Japan, Tsunoda acknowledged that the result has given him a boost as he looks to keep on improving during the remainder of the campaign.

“It's something that gives me more confidence in the future,” the 25-year-old said. “I think we made a couple of changes to the car, which got supported a lot from the team, and also I put my effort into my long run [performance].

“Last week I saw some trend that Max is doing a little bit differently compared to myself, and I had an idea and immediately translated it in the simulator, and I feel something good there but obviously translating it into this real track is a different story.

“I think I'm able to try some multiple steps and show some good steps with that, show some pace from that simulator. It's not the level that I want yet, but I think from the changes to the car it helps a lot for myself, but also some bits from my driving style match well with these changes, so I just keep [with] what I'm doing now and progress more.”

	The popular sports-focused YouTube creator Deestroying has signed with Creative Artists Agency, as the talent agency continues to bulk up its roster of digital creators.


	Deestroying, real name Donald De La Haye, has signed with CAA in all areas. The creator has more than 14 million followers across his social platforms, and has garnered more than 1.6 billion views on YouTube alone.




	Most recently he worked as a sideline correspondent in the 2025 international NFL season opening game in São Paulo for YouTube, working alongside Rich Eisen and Kurt Warner. He also appeared in a commercial during Super Bowl LVIII, and appeared on stage at YouTube's Brandcast event alongside NFL commissioner Roger Goodell.

	











	He was a division football player at the University of Central Florida, and began posting vlogs about his life as a college athlete, however he lost his scholarship after choosing to continue posting videos to YouTube and making money off of them. The case became a flashpoint for college NIL (name, image, likeness) deals and legislation.

	He made his pro football debut last year as a kicker for the San Antonio Brahmas UFL team.

The comic's Mister Whatever tour takes him to his hometown in 2026.


							By 

	Mikey O'Connell


TV Features Editor


John Mulaney is going big with his current tour, following a string of sold-out dates with a marquee performance in his hometown next year. The stand-up is set to play Chicago's Wrigley Field, marking the first time a comic has ever headlined the historic ballpark.


	The Everybody's Live host announced the news on Tuesday night during — what else? — a Chicago Cubs game. Before the Cubs lost to the New York Mets, Mulaney sang “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” to the crowd and then took a seat in the broadcast booth to share the news — noting the venue's daunting capacity.

	











	“Look, if Mark Grace could come out there every day and just deliver ripping cigarettes, I can face down this crowd too,” offered Mulaney.

	Tickets are not yet on sale for the July 11, 2026, performance but it is expected to draw a crowd of tens of thousands. (During baseball games, Wrigley regularly fits north of 40,000.)


	Mulaney began touring Mister Whatever earlier in 2025, and the last three months of the year are packed with dates throughout the U.S. A taped special of his new set has yet to be announced, but it's only a matter of time.And for those more interested in Mulaney's musical stylings, the MLB graciously posted the below clip of his seventh inning stretch serenade.

And he almost “sent an email” to attendees ahead of time explaining what he hoped it would accomplish. That probably would have been a good idea.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



Nate Bargatze proved to be a charitable, generous man at the 77th Emmy Awards — not that he especially planned to be.


	The standup comic said on his Nateland podcast he never planned on donating $250,000 of his own money to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, as he did at the end of the Emmys.




	“I had it in my head one way. It kind of came out another way, but — the reasoning was there,” Bargatze said of the running gag. “I wasn't gonna give that money at the end, like, I wasn't thinking I was gonna have to. But the way it went, I was like, ‘I can't— I'm not gonna not…'”

	The bit went like this: Bargatze, while opening the live awards show, pledged $100,000 of his own money to the Boys & Girls Clubs. Awesome. Even awesome-r, for every tick under 45 seconds a winner's acceptance speech lasted, Bargatze would add another $1,000 from his own pocket. However, for every second over 45 seconds a winner went, he'd deduct $1,000 from the running tally. The bank ended up quite a bit in the red.




			Related Video		







	Bargatze says CBS had specifically asked him to come up with a way to keep acceptance speeches tight. CBS “loved” what he came up with, Bargatze said, as did “everyone at home.”


	You know who didn't? “A lot of the reviews,” Bargatze acknowledged.


Shameless plug here for me being among the few in the media to defend the bit. (That said, it sounds like I was wrong about Bargatze preplanning to cover the overages personally. Whether he wanted to or had to, in the end, he did the right thing.)

	











	Bargatze saw this thing going a whole ‘nother way.


	“I thought it was gonna be, I dunno, Netflix donating, or Apple,” Bargatze said on Nateland's 271st episode. “If someone was giving these long speeches, I just thought they could be like, ‘and Netflix is gonna cover my overage.'”


	“In my head, I pictured they could then go long, but then be a hero,” he said. “But I think I could have explained it more, to be honest.”


	And he almost did. Bargatze said he “almost sent an email out” ahead of the show to explain the game and what he hoped to accomplish with it. A good idea, in hindsight.

McLachlan, who canceled a red carpet performance for her Lilith Fair doc earlier this week out of apparent solidarity with Kimmel, appeared on Tuesday's (Sept. 23) show.


Sarah McLachlan was the musical guest on Tuesday night's (Sept. 23) very special episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!


	The late-night talk show returned to the airwaves a week after ABC pulled the plug following criticism of Kimmel's comments on the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk from the leader of the Federal Communications Commission and Donald Trump.


	McLachlan performed “Better Broken,” the title track from the three-time Grammy Award-winning Canadian artist's first studio album in more than a decade. Seated at a grand piano with dramatic mood lighting giving the set an ethereal glow, McLachlan sang, “Maybe if I catch my breath/ Maybe if I wait a little/ I'd remember how it hurts/ And stop before I fall/ I'd forget to come apart/ And catch myself and hold on tightly.”


	The emotional ballad about accepting romantic heartbreak in which she pledges to “forgive, but not forget,” was pitch perfect for an emotional evening in which Kimmel was frequently near tears during his monologue, in which he described his tumultuous week and the fall-out from his Kirk jokes. 

	











	McLachlan — who is doing the promo rounds for her equally moving ABC News doc Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery — was also a fitting choice because over the weekend the singer appeared to make a gesture of solidarity with Kimmel by refusing to perform at the doc's premiere. “I've grappled with being here tonight and around what to say about the present situation that we are all faced with,” she said in a statement at the premiere. “The stark contraction to the many advances we've made watching the insidious erosion of women's rights, of trans and queer rights, the muzzling of free speech.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	“So happy that Jimmy Kimmel is back on the air and even happier to be performing on Jimmy Kimmel Live TONIGHT!,” McLachlan wrote in a social post before her appearance.  


	Due out Friday, Sept. 19 through Concord Records, Better Broken has been described as “a soul-searching reflection on the fortitude that comes from weathering life's constant storms.”


	The album was primarily recorded at the legendary Sound City Studios in Los Angeles. The Halifax native enlisted help from esteemed musicians including drummer Matt Chamberlain (Bob Dylan, David Bowie) and pedal-steel guitarist Greg Leisz (Kacey Musgraves, Florence + the Machine) and expanded her creative circle by collaborating with producers Tony Berg and Will Maclellan, both known for their work with the indie pop super-trio boygenius.

Jimmy Kimmel made his return to late-night on Tuesday, a week after Disney and ABC made the call to pull Jimmy Kimmel Live! from the air, citing the host's comments about the right-wing response to Charlie Kirk's death. Media companies Sinclair and Nexstar are continuing to preempt the series. Still, while it didn't air on their ABC-affiliate channels last night, Kimmel's 30-minute monologue has racked up nearly 12 million views in the past 12 hours on YouTube.


	The views are continuing to climb, setting the video on track to be the most-viewed upload from Jimmy Kimmel Live! since the host sat down with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and 50 Cent last year. That clip sits at 16 million views.


	“Maybe most of all, I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” Kimmel said in his emotional monologue. “People I never would have imagined, like Ben Shapiro, Clay Travis, Candace Owens, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul. Even my old pal Ted Cruz.… Even though I don't agree with many of those people on most subjects — some of the things they say even make me want to throw up — it takes courage for them to speak out against this administration, and they did, and they deserve credit for it.”

	











	This throws a wrench into the Trump administration's plans. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr claimed that Kimmel attempted to push the narrative that Kirk's shooter “was somehow a MAGA or Republican-motivated person,” again calling it “sick,” in an effort to have the show pulled. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Donald Trump himself threw something of a fit about Kimmel's return. In a rant on Truth Social, he declaring that he intends to sue ABC for bringing the show back. “I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back,” Trump wrote. “The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‘talent' was never there.”

Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers! Let Jimmy Kimmel rot in his bad Ratings.”

	Trump is referencing the settlement in which Paramount agreed to pay $16 million in donations to the future Trump Library after he filed a lawsuit against 60 Minutes, objecting to an interview with Kamala Harris that was not edited to his liking. Around the same time, Paramount was vying for federal approval of an $8 billion merger with Skydance, which had been in limbo for some time.


	When Stephen Colbert referred to the deal as a “big fat bribe,” Paramount suddenly announced it was ending The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, despite the show's top-ranking ratings. Maybe Trump assumed the same would happen to Kimmel. However, if more than 11 million people are willing to tune in online as well, his fight can't be with the networks. Is he going to sue YouTube next? That would make for a great Jimmy Kimmel Live! segment.

Gavin Newsom appeared on The Late Show last night and took the opportunity to reflect the attention he's been getting for his social media posts, which parody those of Donald Trump.


	Host Stephen Colbert asked Newsom why he decides to do “something kind of funny” with his communication strategy. “The strategy is inspiration/desperation,” Newsom explained. “The two driving forces of life. Everything we were doing to try to break through wasn't working any more. And so we decided to do something, to your point, novel called humor. And, I gotta say, often times Democrats, we're a little — we're not as humorous as we should be. We can be a little stiff. And so we thought we'd have some fun with it.” 


	He added, “I never imagined it would break through like it has and get under the skin of the president of the United States. And some of my friends.” 


	Newsom explained that many on the right have been outraged by his approach because “we put a mirror up to Trump and the absurdity of what's going on in this country. The absurdity of Donald Trump. The absurdity of these networks playing into it.” 

	











	Colbert asked Newsom why he thinks people are engaged by his communication. “What do you think people are responding to?” Colbert inquired. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“Just the fight,” Newsom replied. “This has been a tough time. A lot of anxiety, a lot of stress, a lot of folks that honestly just don't know if we're going to get our country back. And I get it.” He acknowledged there's a “weakness” that dominates the Democrats' brand. “What people appreciate is that we're willing to fight,” Newsom said. “And not only fight symbolically, by having a little bit of fun, but fight substantively. We have 41 lawsuits against this son of a bitch. We are pushing back.”

Hootie and the Blowfish frontman Darius Rucker has formed a supergroup, Howl Owl Howl, with R.E.M. bassist Mike Mills and co-founding, former drummer for the Black Crowes, Steve Gorman. Their debut track “My Cologne” arrives Oct. 31, and they're kicking off their inaugural tour Nov. 3 at the Vogue in Indianapolis, Indiana.


	“It feels great to be singing with a rock band again,” Rucker says in a statement. “It's like buddies getting together, but also getting to play with your idols. The stuff we're writing is so different than anything I've tried to do before.”


	Mills shares Rucker's excitement. “You never can explain band chemistry,” he says. “We all like each other. And we all admire each other musically. All those things come together and if it weren't fun, we wouldn't be doing it.”


	According to a press release, the group's music “fuses organic roots rock with an open-minded alternative flair, matching a fluid, feel-oriented rhythm section to the barrel-chested vocal rasp of an iconic frontman.”

	











	The group started with informal jam sessions back in 2021, but it remained a secret until Rucker discussed it with Rolling Stone‘s Brian Hiatt last summer.


			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“You can call it a supergroup if you want, but I think people will really be surprised at how good it is,” Rucker said. “But we're just a band. We're friends, and we jammed together one day at Steve's kid's school with [Nashville session player] Tom Bukovac playing guitar. We were just like, ‘Let's go in the studio and see what happens.' And we went in the studio and to be honest with you, magic happened, and then I just can't wait for the record to get out.'”

	











	There's still no word on when the album will hit, but they'll definitely be playing songs from it on their tour. Their sets will mix Howl Owl Howl originals with songs by R.E.M., the Black Crowes, and Hootie and the Blowfish.

	“There's not a single guarantee,' Gorman says in a statement. “We're finally going to get to plug in and let it rip a little bit.”


	Rucker is no stranger to the R.E.M. catalog. Hootie and the Blowfish have played “Losing My Religion” at most of their concerts over the past two decades. They've also played “(Don't Go Back to) Rockville,” and “It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine).” And a handful of times, they've also done “She Talks to Angels” by the Black Crowes.


	Hootie and the Blowfish played a special show at the Grand Wailea resort in Maui, Hawaii, on Feb. 26. But they've been off the road since last year, and likely won't be touring again any time soon.

	“It would be five or more years — if we ever do it again,” he told Rolling Stone in the middle of the 2024 tour. “I was surprised I agreed to this tour. Because I mean, for me, it's just like, I'm going backwards. You know, as an artist, sometimes you don't want to go backwards.”

Viktor Hovland is an interesting cat.

From chipping off couch cushions to acting like a bobblehead, there is no shortage of Hovland GIF material out there.

His teammate Ludvig Aberg knows first hand that conversations are bound to go down a certain road the more you talk with the Norwegian.

On Wednesday, Aberg visited with the media at Bethpage Black and was asked what worked so well when the pair teamed up in Rome during the 2023 Ryder Cup.

Ryder Cup:How to Watch | Format Schedule

“We're good friends. We speak the same language. We come from a very similar background. Obviously he grew up in Norway, and Sweden are very close in terms of the cultural environment. And yeah, we get along,” Aberg said.

“He's a funny guy to have funny conversations with. They can go in any direction that you don't really expect. We had a good time in Rome, and we've played multiple practice rounds since, and our caddies get along great, too. He's a good friend to have on TOUR and in the team room here.”

If you remember, Hovland and Aberg joined forces during Saturday Morning Foursomes in Rome and throttled Scottie Scheffler and Brooks Koepka, 9 and 7—winning a match before stepping on the 12th tee is just ridiculous. When asked if he takes pride in probably being the last guy to make Scottie cry on the golf course, Aberg said, “It's not something I think about. Obviously that day, it was somewhat of a freak result and something that we didn't quite expect. But it was a cool experience that me and Viktor had, and it was a cool thing to do, yeah.”

As for those “funny conversations” with Viktor, Aberg said the 12th-ranked player in the world doesn't shy away from getting in his alien bag.

“He's always into sort of the UFO deals and all those things, so it's quite interesting,” Aberg said. “I'm not quite down that road just yet. If I hang out with him long enough, I might be. Again, you never really know where it's going to go, which is quite interesting.”

Hovland being a UFO guy is one of the least surprising things I've ever heard. It just makes sense. I'd be devastated if he didn't believe in them.

As for if they'll join forces this time around on Long Island, they haven't been part of the same practice group yet this week. But after that showing in Rome, I wouldn't be surprised if Luke Donald pushes that button.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","other"

Conservative youth group chapters will counter ‘woke indoctrination', says Ryan Walters

The state superintendent in Oklahoma announced plans to put Turning Point USA chapters in every high school in the state, saying it would counter “radical leftist teachers unions” and their “woke indoctrination”.

After far-right activist Charlie Kirk was killed on a college campus earlier this month, requests to start chapters of his conservative youth group, Turning Point, at colleges and high schools have surged, the organization has said.

Oklahoma is the first state where the government is getting involved to promote starting these chapters. In a press release on Tuesday, Ryan Walters, the Oklahoma superintendent, detailed how students could start a chapter of “Club America”, the organization's high school program, by gathering at least three students from the same school and completing a charter agreement. Then, Turning Point will help the club get a teacher sponsor and official recognition, and send materials such as an “activism kit”.

“We will be putting TPUSA on every high school campus in Oklahoma,” Walter said in the press release. “Charlie Kirk inspired a generation to love America, to speak boldly, and to never shy away from debate. Our kids must get involved and active. We will fight back against the liberal propaganda, pushed by the radical left, and the teachers unions. Our fight starts now.”

In a video posted on X, Walters railed further against the “radical leftists” who “dominate classrooms and push woke indoctrination”. “They fight parents' rights, they push parents out of the classroom and they lie to our kids about American history,” he said. The Turning Point chapters would allow kids to participate in “dialogue about American greatness, a dialogue around American values”.

When asked by a local reporter what would happen in a school that said it wouldn't open a chapter of the group, Walters said he would go after the school's accreditation. “They would be in danger of not being a school district if they decided to reject a club that is here to promote civic engagement,” he said. “Everything would be on the table in that scenario.”

Nadine Gallagher, a teacher in Oklahoma, told local news station KOCO that if students wanted to start a club, she's “all for it”. But, she said, “I don't like forced anything.”

Andrew Kolvet, the spokesman for Turning Point USA, said the group has received a “massive surge of inquiries to start new chapters”, particularly after Sunday's memorial for Kirk.

“We are now at over 120,000 inquiries. Even accounting for attrition and duplicates, we are on the cusp of having a TPUSA or Club America chapter in every HS and College campus in America,” Kolvet wrote on X.

Turning Point chapters organize around conservative principles, and the organization's activism kits “promote issues ranging from voter registration, free speech and gun access, to kits entitled ‘Make America Healthy Again'”, according to USA Today. Other projects of Turning Point include a “professor watchlist” and school board watchlist that identifies people who have leftwing views. Turning Point chapters on college campuses also host conservative speakers.

Kirk often went on college speaking tours to debate students and advanced views in person and on his podcast that were at times racist, sexist or otherwise derogatory, including that there was a “great replacement strategy” underway via immigration, that Islam is a “a threat to America” and that “in urban America, prowling Blacks go around for fun to go target white people”.

Walters has come under fire for repeated instances of pushing religion and rightwing politics in Oklahoma schools. He has sought to require schools in the state to show a video of him praying. He pushed to create the country's first Catholic public charter school, which the US supreme court ruled against in May.

He bought Donald Trump-branded Bibles that he wants to put in classrooms. He has installed prominent rightwing figures such as the activist behind the anti-LGBTQ+ group Libs of TikTok and the leader of the Heritage Foundation on state education committees.

He has also said that he wants to require teachers coming to teach in Oklahoma from liberal states to complete an “America First” certification. He pushed to include 2020 election fraud conspiracies in the state's high school social studies curriculum.

Walters also put out a press release on 17 September claiming that teachers who made derogatory comments about Kirk after his death would be fired.

Walters said his office had received 224 reports of “defamatory comments” about Kirk by school staff, 30 reports of “not observing a moment of silence” and three reports of schools that refused to lower their flags for Kirk. The department identified 70 certified teachers who “have made statements regarding Charlie Kirk's murder”.

“Any teacher posting defamatory and egregious comments will NOT be teaching in Oklahoma classrooms and any school that refused to participate in a moment of silence and/or lower their flags for Charlie Kirk is currently under investigation,” the press release said.

Oklahoma ranks among the lowest states in public education quality, with one recent survey putting the state at 50th place.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The price of BTC$113,722.11 remains stuck in the mud and corporate bitcoin treasury firms have gone through a full boom-and-bust cycle in a matter of weeks, but the BTC miners have been in major bull mode thanks to artificial intelligence and high-performance computing as a new growth driver.

The action continued on Wednesday, with the sector posting big gains, led by Riot Platforms (RIOT) and IREN (IREN), each ahead about 13%. Hut 8 (HUT), CleanSpark (CLSK) and Bit Digital (BTBT) were up closer to 6%. From the April lows, IREN has been the standout performer, gaining nearly 500%.

Fueling the momentum today is news that OpenAI, Oracle (ORCL), and SoftBank are accelerating their Stargate AI infrastructure program, with five new U.S. data center sites. The expansion will bring nearly 7 gigawatts of planned capacity and over $400 billion in investment, with a goal of reaching 10 gigawatts by the end of 2025, according to Open AI. 

The sheer scale of speculation for AI demand could be entering ""bubble territory"" but AI miners are one of the main beneficiaries of the capital and infrastructure needed to meet those massive energy requirements.

Even traditional pure-play BTC miners like Riot Platforms (RIOT) and CleanSpark (CLSK) are now moving into AI and high-performance computing and their stocks have both benefitted, with RIOT up 85% year-to-date and CLSK ahead 55%. Interestingly, MARA Holdings (MARA) in recent months pivoted to more of a bitcoin treasury play and it's underperforming most of the sector, gaining just 10% in 2025.

In this story:

Chelsea have released the team's 2025/26 squad photo as they showcased the UEFA Conference League and FIFA Club World Cup trophies.

It has been a mixed start to the season for Chelsea, who are currently sixth in the Premier League table with two wins and a loss from their opening five games.

It is great, therefore, to see that there are plenty of smiles among the players in the squad photo, which the club shared on Wednesday.

Head coach Enzo Maresca sits in the middle, of course, alongside his primary assistant and former Chelsea goalkeeper Willy Caballero.

Next to these two coaches are captain Reece James and vice captain Enzo Fernandez, and in front of them, the two trophies the team won last season: the Conference League and the Club World Cup.

It is also great to see Levi Colwill, who is still recovering from a long-term anterior cruciate ligament injury, again.

When speaking recently about his squad and Chelsea's Premier League title hopes, Maresca insisted that his team has been improving and closing the gap to the leading teams.

""For me, this season, the main target is to continue to improve players, continue to improve the team and try to close that gap. This is, for me, the main focus for this season.""

The Blues are still in contention to compete for four trophies this season, including the Carabao Cup, in which they have just reached the fourth round after beating Lincoln City on Tuesday.

While in the Champions League, Chelsea's return to the competition was unfortunately marked with a defeat to Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich. 

Maresca's men will be able to bounce back with a win as they host Benfica in the Champions League at Stamford Bridge next week. But before that, the next challenge is Brighton in a Premier League bout on Saturday.

            Federal prosecutors are nearing a decision whether to bring possible perjury charges against former FBI Director James Comey, with a legal deadline expiring on Tuesday, according to people familiar with the investigation.
    


            The probe, run by federal prosecutors at the US Attorney's Office for Virginia's eastern district, is examining whether Comey made false statements during his September, 30, 2020, testimony to Congress on his handling of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, people familiar with the matter said. Prosecutors, under criminal law, generally would only have five years to the day to bring a charge.
    


            If a federal grand jury were to approve the case by next week, it would mark one of the highest-profile indictments of a political figure during President Donald Trump's second term in office – and against one of the longtime figures whom Trump and his political allies detest the most from what they call the “deep state” of the federal government.
    


            Comey hasn't been charged with a crime and has maintained in testimony that he's been truthful under oath. An attorney representing Comey in the matter hasn't responded to requests for comment from CNN.

            President Donald Trump has introduced a “Presidential Walk of Fame” along a noticeable walkway outside the West Wing of the White House.
    


            “The Presidential Walk of Fame has arrived on the West Wing Colonnade,” special assistant to the president and communications adviser Margo Martin wrote in a post on X on Wednesday, with a video in which black-and-white portraits of presidents in gold frames can be seen along the colonnade.
    


            The image selected for one former president, however, stands out: President Joe Biden, who instead of a portrait is represented by a photo of an autopen.
    


            Trump has personally been fixated on Biden's autopen use, CNN previously reported, and in June ordered an investigation into his actions and autopen use in a memorandum that cites Biden's “cognitive decline.”
    


            Biden at the time dismissed the suggestions in Trump's memo, saying in a statement, “Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false.”
    


            CNN has reached out to Biden for comment on the new display.
    


            Trump previously suggested that an autopen image would replace his predecessor's portrait.
    


            The president flagged his plans for the portraits several weeks ago in an interview with The Daily Caller, claiming that not all presidents will be treated equally. When asked if there would be a portrait of Biden, Trump said, “We'll put up a picture of the autopen.”
    


            This week, White House press noticed a gold banner with the words “Presidential Walk of Fame” hanging above brown paper squares placed on the wall.
    


            Trump's June memo called on the counsel to the president, in consultation with Attorney General Pam Bondi and other agency heads, to probe whether “certain individuals conspired to deceive the public about Biden's mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the President.” The memo also orders that the investigation include “any activity, coordinated or otherwise, to purposefully shield the public from information regarding Biden's mental and physical health” and “any agreements between Biden's aides to cooperatively and falsely deem recorded videos of the President's cognitive inability as fake.”
    


            Trump has also called for a review of “the policy documents for which the autopen was used, including clemency grants, Executive Orders, Presidential memoranda, or other Presidential policy decisions.”
    


            Biden's advisers have denied any coordinated effort to conceal from the public his deteriorating condition during the final years of his presidency.
    


            While addressing reporters on Air Force One back in March, Trump claimed of the autopen: “I never use it.”
    


            “I mean, we may use it, as an example, to send some young person a letter, because it's nice. … But to sign pardons and all of the things that (Biden) signed with an autopen is disgraceful,” Trump added.
    


            Trump has previously relocated portraits of other presidents, including Barack Obama and George W. Bush, and replaced former first lady Hillary Clinton's portrait with one of himself.
    


            He also began revamping the White House Rose Garden earlier this summer, paving the grass with marble and stone tiles, adding new lighting and speakers to host events. The new patio-style set up takes after Mar-a-Lago, where Trump dines al fresco during his weekends away from Washington, and has been dubbed the “Rose Garden Club.”
    


            Trump's summer renovations to the Rose Garden mark the latest iteration of a space that has evolved over time.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Thune says Republicans open to conversations about Obamacare","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/24/politics/government-shutdown-thune-schumer-trump","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 18:21:46 GMT","


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Wednesday he is open to discussing enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies – a priority of Democrats' – but insisted that those negotiations cannot be tied to a stopgap government funding bill.
    


            “This is a program that needs reform, but I think everybody is willing to sit down and talk about how to make that happen in a context where it should be discussed, not as a hostage to keep the government open,” Thune told CNN's Dana Bash on “Inside Politics,” adding: “This is not the time, the place to do this.”
    


            The Republican leader's comments come as an end-of-month funding deadline looms over Washington. And with party leaders publicly at odds in recent days, the risk of a government shutdown is growing ever more serious.
    


            Thune said he's “happy to have the conversation,” though he said he was hoping that Democrats would “actually have a proposal.”
    


            “What they're talking about is a straight up extension, which as I said, cost $365 billion, has no reforms in it, and this is a program that's desperately needed reform,” he said.
    


How federal agencies will handle a government shutdown under Trump remains to be seen



            Democrats have centered their demands on health care. Their proposed funding bill included expensive health care changes, such as extending the enhanced subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year.
    


            The more generous subsidies were passed in 2021 as part of a Biden administration pandemic relief package. If they are allowed to lapse, enrollees' premiums could skyrocket by 75%, on average, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group. Some 4.8 million more people are expected to be uninsured in 2026 if the beefed-up subsidies expire, a recent Urban Institute report found.
    


            While Republican leaders argue they still have time, Obamacare advocates and state exchange leaders say that it's important to pass an extension before Americans start shopping for coverage next month. Otherwise, folks could be scared off by the higher premiums and smaller subsidies, making it harder to get them to sign up for 2026 coverage even if Congress eventually acts, they say. Open enrollment starts on November 1 in nearly all states.
    


            Permanently expanding the subsidies would cost about $350 billion over the next decade and would result in 3.8 million more people having health insurance, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis released last week.
    


            Republicans have argued it's inappropriate to add such provisions to a stopgap funding bill and that they should be negotiated as part of a year-end funding bill. They point to their proposal to fund the government through November 20 as a “clean” continuing resolution, or CR. It only includes, they say, $30 million in extra security money for members of Congress, $58 million for security for the executive and judicial branch and a funding “fix” for DC to adjust a mistake in an earlier bill.
    


            Pressed by Bash on CNN's reporting that he, along with House Speaker Mike Johnson, had encouraged President Donald Trump to cancel a meeting set for this week with Democratic congressional leaders, Thune acknowledged that the pair had talked, but insisted the president made his own decision.
    


            “I spoke with the president, and I offer, as I often do, my opinions, but I generally don't share those publicly. And as I said before, the president comes to his own conclusions. He spoke, I think, with Speaker Johnson as well,” said Thune.
    


            “I think the president came to the conclusion that it wouldn't be a productive meeting. The Democrats' requests are completely unhinged and unreasonable and unserious, and if they want to have a serious conversation, I think that I'm sure the president would welcome, would be happy to do that.”
    


            Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and his House counterpart, Hakeem Jeffries, pointed Wednesday to the canceled meeting as evidence of Republicans' culpability.
    


            “After agreeing to our demand to meet to prevent a government shutdown, Donald Trump threw an unhinged temper tantrum and canceled the meeting. By refusing to so much as meet with Democrats, Donald Trump and Republicans are barreling the country toward a painful government shutdown,” Schumer and Jeffries said in a joint statement posted to X.
    


            Schumer made a separate appeal in an appearance on MSNBC's “Morning Joe” on Wednesday, saying he thought the sides could reach agreement on some fronts.
    


            “Sit down and talk to us. We can probably come to some agreements,” Schumer said. “There are a lot of people on his side who are upset about what's happening on some of the areas of health care, particularly the ACA but others as well. Just sit and talk with us.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Americans question more about the murder of Charlie Kirk","https://www.rt.com/news/625179-americans-question-more-about-kirk/","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 16:32:00 GMT","

On September 12, Utah Governor Spencer Cox held a press conference at which he announced the capture of a suspect, Tyler Robinson, in the shooting of Charlie Kirk.

After providing a brief outline of what is believed to have transpired on the fateful day, Cox thanked all those who helped “find this person” and “bring justice.” He concluded his comments by saying that he was grateful that “we have an opportunity to bring closure to this very dark chapter in American history.”

But for many observers, Cox's tone of finality sounded premature – remarks more appropriate for the steps outside a courthouse after a guilty verdict. After all, there was no autopsy, no bullet to match the weapon, and no publicly released footage of Robinson committing the act or even being seen with the weapon.

Internet sleuths have seized on perceived inconsistencies in the official story, while X and YouTube are rife with content questioning the narrative as it has been presented in the media. Videos analyzing various technical aspects of the shooting have routinely generated hundreds of thousands of views. Conservative commentator Candace Owens has become perhaps the most visible figure questioning the official story. Her nightly podcasts devoted to the Kirk tragedy have garnered views in the millions. 

RT takes a look at five unanswered questions about the Kirk case that are generating the most buzz in social media and the blogosphere.

What do many see as odd about the claim a 30-06 Mauser was used?Investigators found a Mauser 30-06 in a wooded area near the site of the shooting. This weapon is being presented as what was used to kill Kirk. Robinson also referred to this weapon, which supposedly belonged to his grandfather, in a series of text messages investigators claim he sent to his roommate and lover, Lance Twiggs, shortly after the shooting.

However, many commentators have pointed out that the 30-06 is a very high-powered rifle that is usually used to hunt larger game and that the nature of the wound suffered by Kirk is not consistent with the type of damage expected from such a weapon. Some gun experts have explained that a direct hit from a 30-06 would have removed a good portion of Kirk's neck, exited his body, and left a blood spray in the tarp behind where he was sitting. Gun enthusiasts have released numerous videos showing the type of damage a direct hit by a 30-06 produces.

It has also been pointed out that no photographic evidence has been released showing Robinson in possession of the rifle, and he does not appear to have it with him when seen jumping off the roof of the university building, called the Losee Center, after supposedly shooting Kirk.

Why was there no exit wound?Related to the skepticism about the weapon is the fact that there was seemingly no exit wound. Speculation about this apparent incongruence rose to such a pitch that Turning Point USA spokesman Andrew Kolvet felt compelled to address this claim in a post on X, claiming that he had just spoken with the surgeon who worked on Kirk in the hospital, who admitted that the bullet “absolutely should have gone through” and that he had “seen wounds from this caliber many times and they always just go through everything. This would have taken a moose or two down, an elk, etc.”

But in this case, according to the unnamed surgeon, Kirk's body stopped the bullet, which the surgeon called “an absolute miracle.”

Many have subjected this version to ridicule, calling it implausible and an attempt to mythologize Kirk's death. No formal autopsy has been released. 

Mike from Mrgunsngear, a popular YouTube firearms channel with nearly a million subscribers, called the likelihood of the version being advanced by the FBI and TPUSA as being “1 in 1,000 if at all.”  Kolvet's explanation has also generated significant pushback on X. The vast majority of the roughly 12,000 replies to his original post question his claims.



Why is there no footage of the shot being taken despite CCTV footage covering the whole roof?Shortly after the shooting, the FBI released footage of the purported shooter running on the roof of the Losee Center, from which he is supposed to have fired at Kirk. Footage then shows the individual running across the roof and jumping down onto the ground on the other side of the building.

However, many commentators have noted that the footage from the surveillance camera, which covers the whole roof of the building, only picks up when the individual is running. If the shooting happened on the roof and the entire roof is visible in the frame of the camera, then the authorities would be in possession of the footage that undeniably links Robinson to the crime. The question many are asking is why the footage was edited so that it starts with the suspect running rather than taking the shot or at least clutching the rifle.

Many people have therefore questioned whether Robinson was indeed the shooter and whether the shot was in fact taken from the front.

Why was the crime scene not cordoned off?Many commentators and social media users are wondering why the scene of the shooting wasn't immediately cordoned off and the perimeter secured.

Not just was the site not cordoned off, but a man was filmed taking down the camera that had been mounted right behind Kirk, even moving the chair that Kirk had been sitting on in order to reach the camera above. He is subsequently seen placing the camera on a table, looking around furtively, and then removing the SD card.

Candace Owens later identified the man as a TPUSA employee and reached out to him. The man, who has not been identified, told Owens that he secured the footage in order to turn it over to the authorities. He refused to release it publicly, although, according to Owens, he did allow her to view it over a FaceTime call.

Tampering with a crime scene can be a felony in the state of Utah, but no attempt to hold the man legally accountable has been made. Meanwhile, a Fox News report from just four days after the shooting claims that the site of the tent where Kirk was shot was being rebuilt, with the grass ripped up and new pavement laid down. Many commentators have questioned why the crime scene was given a remake so quickly.





Why has the text message exchange between Robinson and his lover raised eyebrows?The text message exchange released by prosecutors has ignited a storm of skepticism about the authenticity of the conversation. Many commentators point out that the tone of the exchange seems unnatural and some of the vocabulary seems unlikely to be used by someone of Robinson's generation.

Others also note that Robinson, despite boasting of having left no evidence, essentially incriminates himself on nearly every key point. No timestamps for the messages were released.

‘Very mean' animal, appearing out of nowhere and clawing and biting people's legs, still on the loose in Bay Area city

Residents of a San Francisco Bay Area city are on the lookout for an aggressive squirrel that has sent at least two people to the emergency room for medical treatment.

Joan Heblack told ABC affiliate KGO-TV that she was walking in the Lucas Valley neighborhood of San Rafael when a squirrel seemingly came out of nowhere and attacked her leg, clawing and biting.

“It clamped onto my leg. The tail was flying up here. I was like: ‘Get it off me, get off me!'” Heblack said.

Isabel Campoy also said she was attacked while walking in the same area. The squirrel launched itself from the ground to her face and wound up on her arm, leaving it bloody, she said.

Both women went to the emergency room, the TV station reported in its Monday story.

Flyers have now been posted, warning residents that the squirrel is no joke and that more than five people have been attacked by a “very mean squirrel” that “comes out of nowhere”.

Vanessa Potter of WildCare, a wildlife rescue organization in San Rafael, told KGO-TV that the aggressive behavior likely comes from the squirrel being fed and cared for by humans when it was a baby.

She said squirrels are not vectors for rabies. Experts say the public should not feed wild animals.

The city manager's office did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. San Rafael is in Marin county, about 20 miles (32km) north of San Francisco.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

U.S. President Donald Trump's Sept. 23 comment that NATO allies should shoot down Russian aircraft that violate their airspace drew positive reactions from Estonia and Poland.

The endorsements come amid rising tension in NATO's eastern flank following a series of airspace breaches, which have challenged alliance protocols on intercepts, escalation, and collective defense.

""Roger that,"" said Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, signaling his country's support for Trump's position. 

Marko Mihkelson, chairman of the Estonian Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote on social media, ""we got it,"" echoing a brisk acceptance in Tallinn.

Estonia's foreign minister, Margus Tsahkna, earlier told the Kyiv Independent that the Baltic state and its allies must be prepared to both intercept and, if necessary, down aircraft that violate its sovereign airspace.

""The message must be unequivocal: future violations will meet a response — including, if necessary, the interception and downing of intruding aircraft,"" Tsahkna said on Sept. 23. ""This is not only about defending Estonia's borders — it's about defending NATO's borders.""

The reactions follow several recent incidents that raised alarm among NATO members.

Three Russian MiG-31 fighters entered Estonian airspace on Sept. 19 over the Gulf of Finland for roughly 12 minutes before departing, prompting Tallinn to request consultations under NATO's Article 4. 

Days earlier, Poland shot down Russian drones that entered its airspace during a mass attack on Ukraine, the first direct engagement of Russian military assets over NATO territory since the war began.

NATO scrambled two Eurofighter jets over the Baltic Sea on Sept. 21 after an Il-20M reconnaissance plane was detected flying without a filed flight plan. 

The alliance also launched the Eastern Sentry mission to reinforce air defenses along its eastern flank.

Czech President Petr Pavel said on Sept. 20 that NATO needs to stay united and respond decisively to Russian provocations, including by a potential military action.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS News that NATO had not discussed shooting down Russian jets unless they were attacking and that standard practice remains interception.

The Israeli cycling team that has been a focus for pro-Palestinian protests said on Wednesday it was reviewing its branding for next year as sponsors pressured for a name change.

The Israel-Premier Tech team took their full name off riders' jerseys for the recent Vuelta a Espana, which was halted early due to a plethora of protests over the Gaza war.

Some media have reported the word Israel may be removed in the future, but the team did not confirm that.

“The team is currently in the planning phase for 2026 team branding and will communicate any potential changes in due course,” Israel-Premier Tech said in a message to Reuters.

The team is owned by Canadian-Israeli businessman Sylvan Adams and has an Israeli licence.

One of its sponsors, U.K.-based Factor Bikes, has said its support was conditional on disassociating from Israel.

“Without a name change, without a flag change, we won't continue,” its founder Rob Gitelis told Cyclingnews.

Another sponsor, Canadian-based manufacturer and horticulture firm Premier Tech, expressed a similar stance in a statement published by some media this week.

“We are sensitive and attentive to the situation on the international scene, which has evolved considerably since our arrival on the World Tour in 2017,” it said, adding that it had always supported cyclists from Quebec and Canada.

“However, the current situation regarding the team name is no longer sustainable to achieve our goal, which is the very reason for our involvement in cycling.”

Neither company could immediately be reached for comment.

Politicians in Kyiv and Moscow were left scratching their heads Wednesday, trying to understand Donald Trump's latest about-face on the war, after the U.S. President posted on social media that he now believed Ukraine could emerge victorious.

Ukrainian politicians were delighted, and Russian figures openly baffled, by the latest twist, which came barely a month after Mr. Trump greeted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House with a situation map and told Mr. Zelensky that Russia was “so clearly much more powerful” than Ukraine. Both sides are now wondering whether Mr. Trump intends to back up his latest position with any new help for Ukraine's war effort.

Mr. Trump posted Tuesday on his Truth Social platform that “after getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia Military and Economic situation” he believed that – with the support of the European Union and NATO – Ukraine “is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.”

It was yet another stark reversal on Russia and Ukraine from Mr. Trump, who came to office boasting that he could end the war in 24 hours. As recently as the Aug. 19 meeting in the White House – which followed a face-to-face summit in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin – Mr. Trump was pushing Ukraine to accept a peace deal that would allow Russia to keep the roughly 20 per cent of Ukrainian territory it has conquered since February, 2022.

Mr. Trump has also whiplashed between blaming Mr. Zelensky and his own predecessor, Joe Biden, for “starting” a war he viewed as unwinnable (Mr. Putin instigated the conflict by ordering an full-scale invasion of Ukraine), and expressing disappointment with Mr. Putin's unwillingness to make peace.

“It's an unexpected and yet important shift in his stance on Ukraine, and it differs starkly from his previous position when Trump was thinking that Russia is winning the war,” Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of the Ukrainian parliament's foreign affairs committee, told The Globe and Mail on Wednesday. “At the same time what also matters is not only his rhetoric, however positive, but also Trump's actions.”

Speaking to a Fox News interviewer shortly after Mr. Trump posted his new thinking online, Mr. Zelensky said he believed Mr. Trump no longer expected Ukraine to accept a land-for-peace deal to end the war. “I think he understands, for today, that we can't just swap territories. It's not fair,” Mr. Zelensky said.

In his address to the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday, the Ukrainian leader seemed to be working hard to keep the U.S. President onside, condemning last year's assassination attempt against Mr. Trump – “God saved him from a murder attempt” – as well as the recent killing of pro-Trump commentator Charlie Kirk. Mr. Zelensky's speech also echoed Mr. Trump's position on Gaza – he said only that the hostages held by Hamas “must be freed” – and criticisms of the UN that Mr. Trump had levelled in his own speech to the General Assembly on Tuesday.

In his lengthy post, Mr. Trump also referenced reports of gasoline shortages in parts of Russia and said “Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act.” In recent weeks, Ukrainian special forces units – using mostly domestically produced drones – have carried out a series of long-distance strikes targeting Russia's oil-and-gas infrastructure. 

Mr. Merezhko said that while Kyiv was still waiting to see the U.S. impose tough new tariffs and sanctions on Moscow – as Mr. Trump has been threatening to do for months – Mr. Trump's words could be seen as green-lighting Ukraine's use of U.S.-made weapons to strike even deeper into Russia.

Kyiv-based political analyst Peter Zalmayev, however, cautioned that Ukraine needed to “be careful not to keep riding on this Trumpian rollercoaster. This sort of shift in rhetoric can be interpreted many ways.” 

Mr. Trump could be seen as setting the stage for walking away from the war by saying Ukraine could win with European support alone, Mr. Zalmayev said. “Donald Trump is always in this constant mode of gaslighting and drawing attention to things that he will later then disavow.”

Russian politicians, meanwhile, scorned Mr. Trump's new interpretation of events, suggesting that he'd been swayed by meetings with Mr. Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron on the sidelines of the UN meeting in New York.

“After meeting with the clowns from Kyiv and Paris, he published a vivid post. In this new reality, everything is different. Kyiv is winning, Russia is torn to shreds,” former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev wrote on Telegram on Wednesday. 

During a quick pull-aside meeting at the UN, Trump emphasized his new position that Ukraine can win back all territory lost to Russia during a bilateral meeting with Macron.

The Associated Press

Mr. Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of Russia's National Security Council – and who already had a social-media spat with Mr. Trump earlier this year – said it wouldn't be surprising to see Mr. Trump reverse course again and call on Ukraine to surrender. “I have no doubt he will return,” to Russia's side, Mr. Medvedev wrote. “He always returns.”

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Mr. Trump's words would have no impact on the battlefield, where Russian troops continue take heavy losses as they grind slowly forward.

“The fact that Ukraine is being encouraged in every possible way to continue hostilities and the argument that Ukraine can win something back is, in our view, a mistaken argument,” Mr. Peskov said. “The dynamics on the front lines speak for themselves.”

A situation report published Monday by the Kyiv-based Centre for Defence Strategies found that Moscow would likely fail to achieve its military objective of capturing all of southeastern Ukraine by the end of 2025. CDS forecast, however, that key cities including Pokrovsk, in the Donetsk region, and Kupyansk, in the Kharkiv region, would fall to Russian troops in the coming months “provided current dynamics of combat operations are maintained.”

Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has said the incident was ""the most serious attack"" on Denmark's critical infrastructure. A number of flights were diverted from Denmark's main airport after drones disrupted operations.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Tuesday said the incident at Copenhagen Airport, in which large drones disrupted operations, constituted ""the most serious attack on Danish critical infrastructure to date.""

""This says something about the times we live in and what we as a society must be prepared for,"" said Frederiksen, according to the Ritzau news agency.

""Of course, we are not ruling out any possibility as to who is behind it,"" she added.

Frederiksen noted that the attack aligned with the recent trend ""other drone attacks, airspace violations and hacking attacks on European airports.""

Copenhagen Airport halted operations on Monday after multiple drones were spotted in the area, Danish police said.

Copenhagen Airport's official X account said it had shut down operations due to ""activity.""

The airport reopened a few hours later, but recognized there would still be ""delays and canceled departures.""

Copenhagen police earlier posted on social media that the airport was ""closed for take-off and landing, as 2-3 large drones"" had been seen ""flying in the area.""


""We have concluded that this was what we would call a capable operator,"" Danish police Chief Superintendent Jens Jespersen told reporters on Tuesday.

""It's an actor who has the capabilities, the will and the tools to show off in this way,"" he said.

The senior police officer said the drones came from several different directions, turning their lights on and off, before disappearing after several hours.

According to the FlightRadar tracking service, around 35 flights were diverted from the airport.

The service said that Copenhagen Airport halted air traffic at 8:26 p.m. local time (1826 UTC).

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the drones in the Danish capital were ""pattern of persistent contestation at our borders.""

""Our critical infrastructure is at risk,"" she wrote on X, adding that all the facts had yet to be established.

Meanwhile, a drone incident was reported on the same evening at Oslo Airport in Norway, forcing all traffic to move to one runway, according to Norwegian broadcaster NRK. 

Security concerns in northern Europe have been heightened over a recent spate of Russian sabotage activities, as well as multiple drones and fighter jet incursions into NATO airspace in recent weeks.

The near decade-long negotiations between the EU and Indonesia were hastened by the threat of US President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policy. The free trade deal will scrap most tariffs between the regions.

The European Union (EU) and Indonesia on Tuesday reached an agreement on a free trade pact after more than nine years of negotiations. This process was expedited by US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff policy.

EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic and Indonesian Economic Affairs Minister Airlangga Hartarto signed the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) and an Investment Protection Agreement in Bali.

The deal will scrap most tariffs on EU exports including car parts, agriculture and pharmaceuticals, while opening investment in sectors such as electric vehicles.

""I am convinced that today's conclusion of negotiations is just the beginning of an exciting new chapter,"" Sefcovic said.

Airlangga called the agreement ""a milestone,"" which would ""mitigate risks from the impact of the global tariff war.""

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the pact would boost jobs and growth while securing critical raw materials for Europe's clean tech industries.

""Our deal with Indonesia creates new opportunities for businesses and farmers in a major and growing economy,"" von der Leyen added.

The talks, launched in 2016, had been stalled by issues over palm oil and deforestation rules. However, Trump's aggressive tariff policy forced parties to expedite an agreement, Deni Friawan, a researcher at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, told the AFP news agency.

Officials estimate that EU exporters will save about €600 million ($708 million) annually in duties.

About 80% of Indonesia's exports to the EU, including palm oil, footwear, textiles and fisheries, will be tariff-free under the pact.

The EU is Indonesia's fifth-largest trading partner, recorded $30.1 billion in bilateral trade last year and will gain wider access to the country's 280 million consumers.

CEPA is the third trade deal for Brussels with Southeast Asian countries, after those with Singapore and Vietnam. It must now be ratified by EU member states, the European Parliament, and Indonesia before it comes into force, likely by 2027.

Two migrant detainees died after a gunman opened fire at an ICE facility in Texas.

The shooter, who used bullets scrawled with the phrase “anti-ICE”, died at the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The gunman is thought to have fired the shots at around 7am, from the roof of a building adjacent to the Immigration, Customs and Enforcement field centre.

Todd Lyons, the ICE director, said preliminary information suggested that there was a “possible sniper”.

Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Joseph Rothrock, the head of the Texas FBI field office, said: “I could also share with you is that early evidence that we've seen from rounds that were found near the suspected shooter contain messages that are anti-ICE in nature.”

Thanks for tuning in to our live blog after a gunman opened fire at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas, killing two.

This blog is now closed. Read the full story here.

Two migrant detainees have died after a gunman opened fire at an ICE facility in Texas. 

Another person was injured and taken to hospital.

Kash Patel, the FBI director, has labelled the shooting a “despicable, politically motivated” attack against law enforcement.

“While the investigation is ongoing, an initial review of the evidence shows an idealogical motive behind this attack,” he wrote.

“One of the unspent shell casings recovered was engraved with the phrase “ANTI ICE.” More updates will be forthcoming. These despicable, politically motivated attacks against law enforcement are not a one-off.”

Senator Ted Cruz warned that demonising ICE officers fuels political violence.

“Politician demanding that ICE agents be doxed and calling for people to go after their families: stop,” he told the press conference.

“Violence has no place. It is wrong, and we should come together.”

He added that the correct place to debate immigration policy was in Congress, not by condemning government agents doing their jobs.

“If we want to have a debate about immigration policies. We can do so in the halls of Congress without demonising each other, and especially without demonising the men and women who every day put on a badge.”

 

Senator Ted Cruz has issued a message of unity, warning that political violence “must stop”.

Speaking at the press conference, he said: “This needs to stop. Violence is wrong. Politically motivated violence is wrong.

“It was two weeks ago today that we saw a political assassination in Utah that tore the heart out of much of this country.”

In a swipe at political leaders who have weaponised recent acts of violence for their own political agendas, he said: “To every politician who is using rhetoric demonising ICE and demonising CBP: stop.”

Bullets found next to the gunman who carried out today's shooting were inscribed with anti-ICE messages, the FBI said.

Joseph Rothrock, the head of the Texas FBI field office, said: “I could also share with you is that early evidence that we've seen from rounds that were found near the suspected shooter contain messages that are anti ice in nature. 

“Again, this is just the most recent example of this type of attack.”

He added that the FBI is treating the attack as an “act of targeted violence”.

Daniel Comeaux, the Dallas police chief, said that four people were shot, including the shooter.

The Dallas mayor has called for calm from his constituents as rumours swirl over the killer's motive.

Speaking at the press conference, Eric Johnson said: “Let's be patient. Let's remain calm, and let's let our law enforcement partners, our police department, do their job. 

“This is an active investigation. There's still a lot of unanswered questions, and I want to encourage all of you to exercise a little bit of restraint and allow them to do their job.”

A press conference has started in Dallas Texas with Mayor Eric Johnson urging his constituents to pray for those affected by the shooting.

“Join me also in praying for this city that we can come together at a time like this,” he said.

The shooting at an ICE facility will not slow the deportation of illegal migrants, Texas governor Greg Abbott has said.

Mr Abbott said that the state “fully supports” ICE agents and is working to get to the bottom of the gunman's motive.

Texas fully supports ICE 💯Both the Texas Dept. of Public Safety & Texas National Guard work closely with ICE.This assassination will NOT slow our arrest, detention, & deportation of illegal immigrants.We will work with ICE & the Dallas Police Dept. to get to the bottom of…

Migrants who had appointments at the ICE facility have been turned away in the wake of this morning's shooting, according to reports.

This morning's shooting took place at an ICE field office rather than a detention centre.

An ICE field office is an administrative office for agency staff, whereas detention centres are secure facilities used for holding migrants.

The Dallas field office has four holding cells and detainees are processed there before being transferred to a detention facility according to CNN. 

At least one detainee was killed in the attack, and no agents were injured, officials said.

Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, earlier updated her post on X to reflect that it was in fact a field office that was targeted.

Wednesday's shooting comes at a tense time in the US. Charlie Kirk, a conservative campaigner was shot dead while addressing a rally of students at Utah Valley University on Sept 10. President Donald Trump and his top team appeared in front of tens of thousands of people at a memorial service on Sunday, and the nation is on edge amid fears of more political violence.

Authorities are investigating whether today's shooter opened fire from a rooftop, as Kirk's alleged killer is believed to have done.  A man who shot at Mr Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year, also shot from a rooftop.ICE has also been a focal point for anger among Mr Trump's opponents who object to his massive deportation push.

Whatever the motives of the shooter turn out to be, the result is another surge in fears that the US could see more attacks.

Mike Pence, the former vice president, has blamed the Left for today's shooting.

“Praying for the victims and their families following the shooting at @ICEgov field office in Dallas,” he wrote on X.

“The Left's targeting of our brave men and women in uniform MUST STOP NOW. God Bless All the Brave Men and Women of ICE.”

A motive for the attack has not been established and no ICE agents were hurt, officials have said. 

A press conference on this morning's shooting has been delayed.

The briefing was scheduled to take place at 3pm (9am local time), but microphones are still being set up.

It is expected to commence shortly.

JD Vance, the vice president, has linked the shooting to an “obsessive attack against law enforcement”.

No ICE agents were injured during the attack, officials have said, and at least one migrant was killed.

The obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop. I'm praying for everyone hurt in this attack and for their families. https://t.co/wEN3sqyGyQ

One person was killed and two hospitalised after the gunman opened fire at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas, the local police department said.

On September 24, 2025, at about 6:40 a.m., Dallas Police responded to an assist officer call in the 8100 block of north Stemmons Freeway. The preliminary investigation determined that a suspect opened fire at a government building from an adjacent building. Two people were…

The FBI is “fully engaged” in the investigation, Dan Bongino, the deputy director, has said.

Mr Bongino said the bureau is working “in conjunction with our state and federal law enforcement partners”.

The FBI is fully engaged, in conjunction with our state and federal law enforcement partners, at the crime scene in Dallas.

One migrant has been shot dead and multiple others injured by a “possible sniper” at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas.

The shooting unfolded at around 7am on Wednesday morning, multiple news outlets reported.

Police said one person had been killed and two injured after the gunman opened fire from a nearby building.

The suspected shooter is “down” from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, Immigration and Customs Enforcement director Todd Lyons told CNN.

“Preliminary information is a possible sniper,” Mr Lyons said.

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland security spokeswoman, has said that the agency is looking into the possibility that the suspected sniper fired from a nearby rooftop.

In a statement, homeland security secretary Kristi Noem said: “There was a shooting this morning at the Dallas @ICEgov Field Office.

“Details are still emerging but we can confirm there were multiple injuries and fatalities.

“The shooter is deceased by a self-inflicted gun shot wound.

“While we don't know motive yet, we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them. It must stop. “Please pray for the victims and their families.”

My team and I are closely monitoring the situation at the ICE Detention Facility in Dallas. We are praying for the swift recovery of those injured, and we are deeply grateful to the brave first responders who rushed to the scene. https://t.co/1BDJVrehre

Highway camera footage shared on X shows dozens of emergency service cars responding to the scene.

The Dallas ICE facility where a gunman opened fire this morning was targeted by a bomb threat in August.

On August 25, a man arrived at the facility and “claimed to have a bomb in his backpack”, according to a Department of Homeland Security statement.

“We've seen a lot of violence at ICE facilities, and this is not the first time that we've seen an attack, even this year at an ICE facility,” Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland security spokeswoman, told Fox News this morning.

The gunman who shot multiple people at an ICE facility in Dallas possibly opened fire from a nearby rooftop, officials have suggested.

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland security spokeswoman, has said that the agency is looking into the possibility that the suspected sniper fired from a nearby rooftop.

If confirmed, it would be the second high-profile shooting involving a sniper in recent weeks, after Charlie Kirk was killed by a single gunshot fired from a rooftop at a university event in Utah earlier this month.

Tyer Robinson has been charged with killing the prominent conservative activist.

No ICE officers were hurt in the shooting, an agency official has said.

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland security spokeswoman, confirmed to Fox News that ICE agents were not injured but that security at the site may have been.

She added that the investigation was a “fluid situation” and no motive has been identified.

Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security director, has warned that ICE facilities are facing ‘unprecedented violence'.

“While we don't know motive yet, we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them. It must stop. Please pray for the victims and their families,” she wrote on X.

This morning's attack marked at least the third instance of an ICE facility being targeted by gunfire in Texas this year, according to CNN.

In July, 10 suspects were charged for attacking an ICE detention centre in nearby Alvarado, Texas, killing an officer in the process.

The suspects were equipped with tactical gear and weapons, according to ICE.

The gunman who carried out the attack at an ICE facility is dead, officials said.

Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security director, said that the suspect had died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The shooter was described as a white male, police told Fox.

ICE Director Todd Lyons earlier confirmed to CNN that the shooter is “down”.

There was a shooting this morning at the Dallas @ICEgov Detention Facility. Details are still emerging but we can confirm there were multiple injuries and fatalities. The shooter is deceased by a self-inflicted gun shot wound. While we don't know motive yet, we know that our…

At least two detainees were injured in the shooting, officials told CNN.

Todd Lyons, the ICE director, earlier told the network that three people were shot in total and taken to hospital.

Reports suggest at least three people were hit in the attack.

Highway camera footage shows dozens of police cars responding to the scene.

The video shows almost 30 vehicles with flashing lights parked off Dallas's I-35E highway after multiple were shot at a nearby ICE facility.

The footage, obtained by CNN, was captured around 8.20am ET.

Multiple people have reportedly been shot by a “possible sniper” at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas.

The shooting unfolded at around 7am on Wednesday morning, multiple news outlets reported.The suspected shooter is “down” from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, Immigration and Customs Enforcement director Todd Lyons told CNN.

“Preliminary information is a possible sniper,” Mr Lyons added.

In a statement, homeland security secretary Kristi Noem said: “There was a shooting this morning at the Dallas @ICEgov Field Facility.

“Details are still emerging but we can confirm there were multiple injuries and fatalities.

“The shooter is deceased by a self-inflicted gun shot wound.

“While we don't know motive yet, we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them. It must stop. “Please pray for the victims and their families.”Two of the victims are ICE detainees, CNN reported.

Democrat Adelita Grijalva defeated her Republican opponent by nearly 40 points.

The special election race to fill a vacancy in Arizona's 7th Congressional District has been won by Democratic candidate Adelita Grijalva, a former Pima County supervisor and member of the Tucson school board, narrowing the already-slim Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. 

Grijalva's win on Tuesday also means that there will likely be enough support in the House to force a bipartisan vote on releasing federal investigative files relating to disgraced financier and accused child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.

Grijalva will serve out the remainder of the term that the late Rep. Raúl Grijalva, her father, was set to complete before he passed away in March. In winning her race, Grijalva becomes the first-ever Latina congresswoman to represent Arizona in Washington.

Grijalva handily defeated her Republican opponent, Daniel Butierez. With 87 percent of the votes counted, Grijalva had a commanding lead of 68.5 percent, while Butierez attained only 29.8 percent of the vote. 

In her victory speech, Grijalva referenced her father's commitment to serving his community, both at home and in the nation's capital.

“More than 50 years ago, my dad started a movement based on dignity and equity for all. Fifty years later, that movement is alive,” Grijalva told her supporters.

She then vowed to push for a vote on releasing the Epstein files on her first day in office.

“We reject the MAGA agenda and we will hold this administration accountable,” Grijalva said.

Grijalva's win on Tuesday narrows the Republican House majority, with the GOP now holding 219 seats to Democrats' 214 seats. (Two spots remain vacant.) That means Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson can only afford two dissenting votes from his own party to pass bills, at least for the time being.

Grijalva's win also makes her the 218th lawmaker in the House to support a bipartisan call for the release of the Epstein files, as a few Republicans agree with the Democratic conference on doing so. With that number reached, lawmakers in the chamber can now file a discharge petition, allowing them to put a bill up for a vote without prior approval from the speaker. If that bill passes, it would then head to the Senate for debate and a vote.

The House vote would be a political embarrassment for Johnson, who has been a staunch defender of President Donald Trump, especially when it comes to the Epstein files. Trump, who was once friends with Epstein, has characterized demands for the files' release as a “hoax” against him, and Johnson has defended the president at every juncture where the Epstein files are brought up.

Johnson, for example, at one point defended Trump by claiming that the president was an FBI informant in the Epstein case. The speaker then walked those comments back, instead saying that Trump was cooperative with the FBI on the matter, as implying that he was an “informant” gave the impression that Trump knew about Epstein's misdeeds. 

There is huge distrust among the American public when it comes to the Epstein files. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll published in July, 69 percent of respondents said they believed the federal government was withholding important facts about Epstein and his associates. Only 6 percent said they didn't believe such facts were being kept secret, while another 25 percent said they were unsure.

Live Updates


            • The victims: One detainee is dead and two more are in critical condition following a shooting at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Dallas, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
    


            • “Targeted violence”: The FBI is investigating it “as an act of targeted violence.” The shooter — identified by sources as Joshua Jahn — died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he “fired indiscriminately” at the ICE building from a nearby rooftop, according to the DHS.
    


• Message on casing: FBI Director Kash Patel posted an image of bullet casings on social media found near the suspected shooter, showing one with the words “ANTI-ICE” written on it.



            Aerial video captured by CNN affiliate KTVT shows officers searching a building where authorities say a gunman fired at the nearby ICE facility in Dallas and shot three ICE detainees.
    


            Several law enforcement officers can be seen on the roof of the building while others enter.
    


            The video later pans to shows an aerial view of the ICE facility.
    


            The shooter fired “indiscriminately” at the ICE facility from the other building's rooftop Wednesday morning, “including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot,” the Department of Homeland Security has said. Of the three ICE detainees shot, two were killed, and a third was hospitalized, authorities have said.
    


            Vice President JD Vance responded sharply to the deadly shooting at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas on Wednesday, calling it an act of politically motivated violence and directly blaming what he described as inflammatory rhetoric from Democratic leaders and the media.
    


                    “We're still learning a little bit about it,” Vance said during remarks in Concord, North Carolina, “but what we know is that in Dallas, Texas, an ICE facility was opened fire upon by a violent left-wing extremist a person who wrote anti-ICE messaging on their bullets.”
                





            The vice president claimed that the attack was politically driven, saying: “And there's some evidence that we have that's not yet public, but we know this person was politically motivated.”
    


            The FBI has said it is investigating the shooting “as an act of targeted violence.” The suspected shooter is Joshua Jahn, according to three sources familiar with the case. Authorities said the shooter was found dead at the scene.
    


            FBI Director Kash Patel posted an image of rounds recovered on X, with one of the five casings in the photo bearing the words “ANTI-ICE” written in blue ink.
    


            Vance went on to accuse figures like California Gov. Gavin Newsom and left-leaning media outlets of vilifying law enforcement and creating an environment that fuels violence.
    


            “When the left-wing media lies about what [ICE is] doing,” he said, “what they're doing is encouraging crazy people to go and commit violence.”
    


            “You don't have to agree with Donald Trump's immigration policies. But if your political rhetoric encourages violence against our law enforcement, you can go straight to hell.”
    


            Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons described today's shooting as “a tragic incident” that “unfolded so quickly.”
    


            Lyons told Fox News this afternoon that the shooter fired into an open waiting area known as the sallyport, where agents brought in detainees. He said the ICE facility was “a definite target,” adding that windows, doors and vehicles were also fired at.
    


            “It wasn't directed at the detainees. It wasn't directed at civilians on the street. It was a definite attack on law enforcement. He was there to attack that building,” Lyons told Fox.
    


            He said everyone is “shook up” by the incident and called for an end to violence against ICE.
    


            Regarding next steps after the Dallas shooting, Lyons told Fox securing the facility and ensuring safety is the agency's top priority.
    


            “What we got to do first and foremost is protect the men and women of ICE, harden up our facilities, make sure we're safe,” he said. “Then we really got to target these people that are anti-ICE rhetoric or causing threats and really take a deep dive and see what happened with this gentleman right here.”
    


            Joshua Jahn, the suspect who authorities believe gunned down two detainees and injured a third at a Dallas ICE facility, was previously charged a decade ago with delivering marijuana, court records show.
    


            Jahn, 29, had lived in a Dallas suburb, according to public records. Three sources told CNN that he is the shooter, and authorities have said the gunman killed himself after opening fire.
    


            In 2016, when he was 19 years old, Jahn was charged with delivering more than one-fourth ounce of marijuana. He pleaded guilty and the case again him was deferred, with Jahn being placed on probation, according to Collin County court records. The charge is classified in Texas law as a “state jail felony,” the least severe type of felony in the state.
    


            Jahn voted in the Democratic primary in March 2020 and hasn't voted since then, according to records provided to CNN by the Collin County Elections Department. Voters in Texas don't declare a political party when registering to vote, but choose a party's ballot when voting in primaries.
    


            Dallas Mayor Eric L. Johnson called for healing and unity after a shooting at an ICE facility left two people dead Wednesday.
    


            “We are better than this craven act of violence,” the mayor said in a statement. “In moments like this, our city must stand together and support one another. We must heal.”
    


            He said violence like Wednesday's shooting should never happen and that it affected an entire community, not just law enforcement and the victims.
    


            “It is an attack on our community and on our nation's heritage of civil and democratic discourse,“ Johnson said. “We should all condemn violence intended to serve a political agenda and work together to end it.”
    


            A gunman targeted an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Dallas, Texas, this morning, leaving one detainee dead and two others hospitalized in critical condition.
    


            Authorities have said the gunman killed himself after opening fire.
    


The FBI is investigating the shooting as “an act of targeted violence,” according to Special Agent in Charge Joe Rothrock. None of the people shot were members of law enforcement, he said.
    


Here's more on what we know, so far, about today's shooting:



The gunman: Three sources familiar with the case identified the shooter as 29-year-old  Joshua Jahn. Jahn lived in a Dallas suburb, according to public records. Jahn voted in the Democratic primary in March 2020 and hasn't voted since, according to records provided to CNN by the Collin County Elections Department. The Department of Homeland Security described Jahn as a “sniper” who opened fire “indiscriminately” on the Dallas ICE facility.
    


The victims: The three detainees who were shot were in the country illegally, had been arrested and were awaiting transfer to a longer-term facility, ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan told Fox News. In a corrected statement, DHS said “one detainee is deceased, and two others are in critical condition.”
    


The shooting: Dallas police received an “assist the officer call” at around 6:40 a.m. local time, Chief Daniel Comeaux said during a news conference today. Sheahan said the gunman fired “indiscriminately” and authorities “found bullets throughout the entire building that had punctured into the facility.” The shooter fired into the ICE facility from the rooftop of another building, authorities have said.
    


Bullet casings: FBI Director Kash Patel and DHS said bullet casings with “anti-ICE messages” were found. DHS said in a statement, “This was an attack on ICE law enforcement.”
    


CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, Leigh Waldman, Chris Boyette, Alisha Ebrahimji, Casey Tolan, Curt Devine and Maureen Chowdhury contributed to this report. 



            The shooter believed to be responsible for killing two detainees and injuring a third at a Dallas ICE facility is Joshua Jahn, according to three sources familiar with the case.
    


            Jahn is 29 years old, one source briefed on the investigation told CNN.
    


            Authorities have said the shooter was found dead at the scene.
    


            Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons confirmed the suspect's identity in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday afternoon, saying of Joshua Jahn, “he was known to law enforcement.”
    


            Lyons said investigators are “going to get with all his contacts, scrub his social media, maybe go to his parents' home or where he was living. But they want to drill down and figure out what made him anti-ICE, what made him want to do that, and see if there's any co-conspirators, see if the facility is still safe, see if anything else is still planned.”
    


            The three detainees shot at the ICE facility in Dallas Wednesday – two of whom were killed – had been arrested and were to be transferred to a longer-term facility, ICE deputy director Madison Sheahan told Fox News.
    


            The shooter fired “indiscriminately” at the ICE facility from a rooftop of another building, “including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot,” the Department of Homeland Security has said.
    


            The three detainees were in the country illegally and “being processed at this facility and would have been moved to a long-term detention facility,” Sheahan told Fox News.
    


            Two detainees were killed, and one is in serious condition after the shooting, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN.
    


            “We are working with our local officers to identify next of kin and make sure those notifications are made. Until that time, I don't want to jump ahead on any families dealing with this tragedy,” she said.
    


            The person who shot into the Dallas ICE facility fired “indiscriminately,” according to ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan.
    


            “What we do know so far is that the shooter was firing indiscriminately throughout the whole building,” Sheahan told Fox News on Wednesday. “The shooter was at a building nearby, shooting directly into the building, going across the entire length of the building.”
    


            The deputy director added that it was a potentially “very dangerous situation” for law enforcement. No law enforcement personnel were injured, according to Joe Rothrock, special agent in charge of the FBI's Dallas field office.
    


            “We found bullets throughout the entire building that had punctured into the facility, targeting the entire ICE facility,” Sheahan said.
    


            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said the shooting at the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Dallas today will not deter officials from carrying out immigration actions.
    


            “We will not let this cowardly attack impede our efforts to secure the border, enforce immigration law, and ensure law and order,” Abbott said in a statement.
    


            He said agencies like ICE, in coordination with the state's Department of Public Safety and the National Guard, will continue to “arrest, detain, and deport any individuals in this country illegally — without interruption.”
    


            Calling the shooting “horrific,” the governor said “the ongoing onslaught of violent and subversive rhetoric from the Left” should be denounced.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security has issued a new statement on the shooting at the Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility.
    


            Bullet casings with “anti-ICE messages” were found on scene where a “sniper” opened fire and shot three detainees, according to DHS.
    


            “This morning, a sniper opened fire from a nearby rooftop on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Dallas field office. The shooter fired indiscriminately at the ICE building, including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot,” it said.
    


            “Three detainees were shot. Two are deceased, and the other is in critical condition. The gunman was found with a self-inflicted gun wound,” according to the statement.
    


            The DHS statement also noted that “shell casings were found with anti-ICE messages on them. This was an attack on ICE law enforcement.”
    


            FBI Director Kash Patel posted about the casings on X earlier. Of the five casings shown in the photo Patel posted, one has the words “ANTI-ICE” written in blue ink.
    


            Following a news conference outside the Dallas ICE facility where the head of the FBI field office said rounds were found near the suspected shooter containing “messages that are anti-ICE in nature,” FBI Director Kash Patel posted an image of rounds on X.
    


            The FBI didn't provide any details during the briefing about what was written on the ammunition until shortly after the news conference.
    


            Of the five casings shown in the photo Patel posted on X, one has the words “ANTI-ICE” written in blue ink.
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is blaming “far-left” rhetoric about US Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the deadly shooting at a field office in Dallas this morning.
    


                    “For months, we've been warning politicians and the media to tone down their rhetoric about ICE law enforcement before someone was killed,” Noem said in a post on X. “These horrendous killings must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences.”
                





            So far, officials have given little information about a possible motive.
    


            Noem said ICE agents “get up every morning to try and make our communities safer,” and they should not be dehumanized.
    


            Two detainees were killed and one is in serious condition after the shooting, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN. During an earlier news conference, officials said no law enforcement agents were injured or shot.
    


            Two detainees were killed, and one is in serious condition after a shooting at a Dallas ICE facility Wednesday morning, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN.
    


            During an earlier press conference, authorities didn't provide details on the fatalities but noted that no law enforcement agents were injured or shot.
    


            In a post on X, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem condemned heightened rhetoric against ICE, saying: “These horrendous killings must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences.”
    


            Ruth Harper, an immigration attorney based in Dallas, Texas, reported to the Dallas ICE facility on Wednesday morning for a routine check in for her client, she told CNN Wednesday.
    


            When she arrived, police had blocked off access to the facility and told her there was an active shooter. She said her initial reaction was “terrified” for her clients.
    


“Usually, they are only there a short time before they are moved to a detention center,” she said. 






            One of her clients is at the facility; another, who was expected to report for the check in today, was not on site.
    


            Dallas police said one person is dead and two people are hospitalized with injuries after a shooting this morning at the ICE field office in Dallas.
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem earlier said the suspect died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
    


             Multiple law enforcement officials told CNN the person killed was a detainee.
    


            “Today, at approximately 6:40 a.m. (local time), we received a(n) assist the officer call. We responded to the call, got to the scene, and we later learned that we had four individuals that were shot, two of them deceased, including the shooter,” Chief Daniel Comeaux said at the news conference. “DPD quickly was able to locate the shooter who was deceased.”
    


            GOP Sen. Ted Cruz urged politicians to stop using rhetoric that is “demonizing” Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Patrol agents.
    


            “This needs to stop. Violence is wrong. Politically motivated violence is wrong,” Cruz said during a news conference in Dallas following the ICE facility shooting.
    


            Cruz said that this morning's incident is “the third shooting in Texas directed at ICE or CBP. This must stop. To every politician who is using rhetoric demonizing ICE and demonizing CPB, stop.”
    


            He continued: “To every politician demanding that ICE agents be doxxed and calling for people to go after their families, stop. This has very real consequences.”
    


                    Cruz went on to say that he hopes that “every one of us will pray, number one for the law enforcement that are risking their lives to keep us safe; number two, for the health of those who were shot and injured today. We still don't know the full details of who was injured, but for the families of the victims of this shooting.”
                





            He added that a debate about immigration policies can happen in the halls of Congress “without demonizing each other.”
    


            The deadly shooting at an ICE facility near downtown Dallas is believed to be a targeted incident, according to the head of the FBI field office in Dallas.
    


            “I can confirm at this time that the FBI is investigating this incident as an act of targeted violence,” said Special Agent in Charge Joe Rothrock.
    


                    “Early evidence that we've seen from rounds that were found near the suspected shooter contain messages that are anti-ICE in nature,” Rothrock added.
                





            The FBI did not provide further details on what was written on the ammunition.
    


            None of the people shot in this morning's shooting at a Dallas ICE facility were members of law enforcement, FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Joe Rothrock said, though officials are not yet confirming the identities of the victims.
    


                    “This will be an ongoing investigation between us, a number of federal partners and our local partners, again, to ensure that anyone responsible is held accountable,” Rothrock said.
                





            Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson asked people to “be patient” and “remain calm” as law enforcement conduct the investigation into Wednesday morning's shooting at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas.
    


                    “This is an active investigation,” he said. “There's still a lot of unanswered questions, and I want to encourage all of you to exercise a little bit of restraint and allow them to do their job, to help make sure this continues to be a safe city, and that they can help us figure out what happened here today.”

President Donald Trump addresses the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2025, at U.N. headquarters. (AP Photo/Angelina Katsanis)

In his speech before the U.N. General Assembly, President Donald Trump promoted a second-term talking point about his efforts to settle multiple conflicts around the world.

“In a period of just seven months, I have ended seven unendable wars. They said they were unendable.” he said Tuesday, repeating a claim he frequently makes.

Trump has helped with mediations but experts say his impact is not as clear-cut as he portrays.

Here's a closer look:

Trump is credited with ending the 12-day war.

In June, Israel launched attacks on the heart of Iran's nuclear program and military leadership, saying it wanted to stop Tehran from building a nuclear weapon. Iran has denied it was trying to do that.

Trump negotiated a ceasefire after directing American warplanes to strike Iran's Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites. 

Evelyn Farkas, executive director of Arizona State University's McCain Institute, said Trump should get credit for ending the war.

“There's always a chance it could flare up again if Iran restarts its nuclear weapons program, but nonetheless, they were engaged in a hot war with one another,” she said. “And it didn't have any real end in sight before President Trump got involved and gave them an ultimatum.”

Lawrence Haas, a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the American Foreign Policy Council who is an expert on Israel-Iran tensions, agreed the U.S. was instrumental in securing the ceasefire. But he characterized it as a “temporary respite” from the ongoing “day-to-day cold war” between the two countries that often involves flare-ups.

This could be described as tensions at best, and peace efforts, which do not directly involve the United States, have stalled.

The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile River has caused friction among Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan since the power-generating project was announced more than a decade ago. In July, Ethiopia declared the project complete. It was inaugurated this month.

Egypt and Sudan oppose the dam. Although the vast majority of the water that flows down the Nile originates in Ethiopia, Egyptian agriculture relies on the river almost entirely. Sudan fears flooding and wants to protect its own power-generating dams.

During his first term, Trump tried to broker a deal between Ethiopia and Egypt. He could not get the countries to agree and suspended aid to Ethiopia over the dispute. In July, he posted on Truth Social that he helped the “fight over the massive dam (and) there is peace at least for now.” But the disagreement persists, and negotiations between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan have stalled.

“It would be a gross overstatement to say that these countries are at war,” Haas said. “I mean, they're just not.”

The April killing of tourists in Indian-controlled Kashmir pushed India and Pakistan closer to war than they had been in years, but a ceasefire was reached.

Trump has claimed that the U.S. brokered the ceasefire, which he said came about in part because he offered trade concessions. Pakistan thanked Trump, recommending him for the Nobel Peace Prize. India has denied Trump's claims, saying there was no conversation between the U.S. and India on trade in regards to the ceasefire.

Although India played down the Trump administration's role in the ceasefire, Haas and Farkas believe the U.S. deserves some credit for helping stop the fighting.

“I think that President Trump played a constructive role from all accounts, but it may not have been decisive. And again, I'm not sure whether you would define that as a full-blown war,” Farkas said.

The White House lists the conflict between these countries as one Trump resolved. But there has been no threat of a war between the two neighbors during Trump's second term or any significant contribution from the Republican president this year to improve their relations.

Kosovo is a former Serbian province that declared independence in 2008. Tensions have persisted since, but never to the point of war, mostly because NATO-led peacekeepers have been deployed in Kosovo, which has been recognized by more than 100 countries.

During his first term, Trump negotiated a wide-ranging deal between Serbia and Kosovo, but much of what was agreed on was never carried out.

Trump has played a key role in peace efforts between the African neighbors, but he is hardly alone and the conflict is far from over.

Eastern Congo, rich in minerals, has been battered by fighting with more than 100 armed groups. The most potent is the M23 rebel group. It is backed by neighboring Rwanda, which claims it is protecting its territorial interests and that some of those who participated in the 1994 Rwandan genocide fled to Congo and are working with the Congolese army.

The Trump administration's efforts paid off in June, when the Congolese and Rwandan foreign ministers signed a peace deal at the White House. The M23, however, was not directly involved in the U.S.-facilitated negotiations and said it could not abide by the terms of an agreement that did not involve it.

The final step to peace was meant to be a separate Qatar-facilitated deal between Congo and M23 that would bring about a permanent ceasefire. There have been no public signs of major talks between Congo and M23 on the final terms.

In August, Trump hosted the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan at the White House, where they signed a deal aimed at ending a decades-long conflict. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan called the signed document a “significant milestone.” Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev hailed Trump for performing “a miracle.”

The agreements were intended to reopen key transportation routes and reaffirm Armenia's and Azerbaijan's commitment to signing a peace treaty. The treaty's text was initialed by the countries' foreign ministers at that meeting, which indicated preliminary approval. But the two countries have yet to sign and ratify the deal.

Armenia and Azerbaijan have been in a bitter conflict over territory since the early 1990s, when ethnic Armenian forces took control of the Karabakh province, known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh, and nearby territories. In 2020, Azerbaijan's military recaptured broad swaths of territory. Russia brokered a truce and deployed about 2,000 peacekeepers to the region.

In September 2023, Azerbaijani forces launched a lightning blitz to retake remaining portions. The two countries have worked toward normalizing ties and signing a peace treaty ever since.

Officials from Thailand and Cambodia credit Trump with pushing the Asian neighbors to agree to a ceasefire in this summer's brief border conflict.

Cambodia and Thailand clashed in the past over their shared border. The latest fighting began in July after a land mine explosion along the border wounded five Thai soldiers. Tensions had been growing since May, when a Cambodian soldier was killed in a confrontation that created a diplomatic rift and roiled Thai politics.

Both countries agreed in late July to an unconditional ceasefire during a meeting in Malaysia. 

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim pressed for the pact, but there was little headway until Trump intervened. Trump said on social media that he warned the Thai and Cambodian leaders that the U.S. would not move forward with trade agreements if the hostilities continued. Both countries faced economic difficulties and neither had reached tariff deals with the U.S., though most of their Southeast Asian neighbors had.

According to Ken Lohatepanont, a political analyst and University of Michigan doctoral candidate, “President Trump's decision to condition a successful conclusion to these talks on a ceasefire likely played a significant role in ensuring that both sides came to the negotiating table when they did.”

JERUSALEM (AP) — A drone launched by Yemen's Houthi rebels wounded 22 people in the southern Israeli city of Eilat on Wednesday, according to medics. It was a rare breach of Israel's sophisticated missile defenses, which have greatly limited casualties from such attacks. 

In the Gaza Strip, at least 41 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire, according to local hospitals. U.S. President Donald Trump's Mideast envoy expressed optimism over a new plan for ending the war, without saying what it entails or if Israel or Hamas have accepted it.

Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have regularly fired drones and missiles at Israel — and attacked international shipping — in what they say is support for the Palestinians. The vast majority of the drones and missiles fired at Israel have been shot down or fallen in open areas without wounding anyone. 

The Houthis said in a statement that they had fired two drones at Israel. Israel has carried out retaliatory airstrikes on Yemen after past attacks, and Defense Minister Israel Katz, in a post on X, warned the Houthis that “anyone who harms Israel will be harmed sevenfold.”

The Israeli military said it had tried to intercept the drone. The Magen David Adom rescue service said the wounded were taken to a nearby hospital, two of them with “severe shrapnel injuries to their limbs.”

In Gaza, at least 22 people were killed when an Israeli strike hit tents sheltering displaced people in Gaza City, according to Dr. Fadel Naim, director of the Al-Ahli hospital, which received the casualties. Three children and nine women were among those killed, he told The Associated Press.

The Israeli military said it targeted two Hamas militants, using precise munitions and taking other measures to avoid harming civilians. Israel blames Hamas for civilian deaths because the militants are embedded in densely populated areas.

Another Israeli strike hit a group of Palestinians in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing at least 12 of them, according to the Al-Awda Hospital. Another 18 people were wounded, it said. Four people — two children and their parents — were killed in a strike on their home in Nuseirat, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah.

There was no immediate comment from the military on those strikes.

Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza said that it received the bodies of three people killed by gunfire while seeking aid. Health officials in Gaza and the U.N. human rights office say hundreds of people have been killed by Israeli fire while seeking humanitarian aid in recent months. 

The military has said it only fires warning shots when people approach its forces in what it considers a threatening manner.

In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, a 24-year-old Palestinian was shot and killed by Israeli forces near the northern city of Jenin, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The military said soldiers shot and killed a man after he hurled an explosive device at them.

The latest violence came as the Mideast crisis was front and center at the U.N. General Assembly.

At separate events, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's lead negotiator Steve Witkoff both offered optimistic views about what Witkoff called a “Trump 21-point plan for peace” that was presented to Arab leaders on Tuesday.

“We had a very productive session,” Witkoff said at a conference in New York. “I think it addresses Israeli concerns, as well as the concerns of all the neighbors in the region. And we're hopeful, and I might say even confident, that in the coming days, we'll be able to announce some sort of breakthrough.”

Speaking to senior officials from the Gulf Cooperation Council, Rubio said “some very important work is ongoing even as we speak, and we're hoping to achieve this as soon as possible.”

Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, in a post on X, said the latest proposals are “an important foundation upon which we can build further in the coming period to achieve peace.”

The U.S., along with Egypt and Qatar, have spent months trying to broker a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release. Those efforts suffered a major setback earlier this month when Israel carried out an airstrike targeting Hamas leaders in Qatar.

The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. Forty-eight captives are still inside Gaza, around 20 of them believed by Israel to be alive, after most of the rest were freed in ceasefires or other deals.

Israel's ongoing retaliatory offensive has killed more than 65,000 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It doesn't say how many were civilians or combatants, but says women and children make up around half the fatalities. The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government. U.N. agencies and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties.

Israel launched another major ground operation earlier this month in Gaza City, which experts say is experiencing famine. More than 300,000 people have fled, but up to 700,000 are still there, many because they can't afford to relocate.

Deputy I.C.E. Director Madison Sheahan shares the latest information on the deadly shooting at a Dallas facility on 'America Reports.'

Vice President JD Vance said that those who denigrate law enforcement are encouraging ""crazy people to go and commit violence,"" after a shooter opened fire at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility Wednesday in Dallas. 

""You don't have to agree with my immigration policies. You don't have to agree with Donald Trump's immigration policies. But if your political rhetoric encourages violence against our law enforcement, you can go straight to hell,"" Vance said Wednesday during a trip to North Carolina. ""And you have no place in the political conversation of the United States of America.""

""If you want to stop political violence, stop attacking our law enforcement as the Gestapo,"" Vance said. ""If you want to stop political violence, stop telling your supporters that everybody who disagrees with you is a Nazi. If you want to stop political violence, look in the mirror. That's the way that we stop political violence in this country."" 

The FBI claimed it is investigating the matter as a ""targeted attack"" against ICE, and the Department of Homeland Security said it had identified shell casings with ""anti-ICE"" messages.

Three detainees were shot. Two have subsequently died while one is in critical condition, according to a statement from DHS. 

No ICE officers were harmed in the shooting and authorities said the shooter died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. 

""Look, just because we don't support illegal aliens, we don't want them to be executed by violent assassins engaged in political violence either,"" Vance said. ""So we're praying both for our ICE agents, but also for everybody who's affected by this terrible attack.""

There have been multiple shootings at ICE facilities in 2025, and DHS reported in July that assaults against ICE officers and other federal immigration agents have risen nearly 700% compared to 2024. While the agency reported 10 assault incidents between Jan. 1, 2024, and June 30, 2024, that number rose to 79 reported assaults in the same time frame in 2025. 

Other recent episodes of violence against law enforcement include another shooting near ICE's Prairieland, Texas, Detention Facility in July, where a police officer was shot in the neck.

The White House previously has called on Democrats to de-escalate language toward ICE amid opposition to the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda. 

For example, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., accused ICE of acting ""like a terrorist force"" in June, and later defended her comments in a CNN interview after the White House demanded an apology from the lawmaker.

Former FBI special agent Nicole Parker discusses the latest details on the deadly shooting at a Dallas ICE facility during ‘The Faulkner Focus.'

Democrats' fiercest rhetoric against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security resurfaced Wednesday after the fatal sniper attack on a Dallas federal immigration facility.

A suspect fired several shots, reportedly ""indiscriminately,"" at the Sally Port of an ICE facility just off Interstate 35E near Dallas-Love Field that killed at least one detainee and injured others.

Hours prior, Newsom appeared on CBS' ""Late Show"" where he raged against federal agents who have masked-up to avoid being doxxed by activists in the Golden State.

ANTI-ICE RIOTS REVEAL THE LEFT HAS LEARNED NOTHING. IT'S JUST HANDED TRUMP A GIFT

Newsom recounted the detention of a teenager outside a school, describing it as ""men jumping out of unmarked cars. People disappearing. No due process. No oversight. Zero accountability: Happening in the United States of America today.""

""People ask: ‘Well, is authoritarianism you being hyperbolic?' Bulls--- we're being hyperbolic… These are not just authoritarian tendencies, these are authoritarian actions by an authoritarian government,"" Newsom told host Stephen Colbert.

He went on to call President Donald Trump a ""son of a b----"" and added that people have voiced appreciation for his state's 41 lawsuits against the administration – while also warning that the 2028 election may not come to pass.

""ICE: unmask – what are you afraid of?"" Newsom asked rhetorically at a press conference earlier this week announcing the first-in-the-nation law banning law enforcement from obscuring their identities.

At his commencement speech for the University of Minnesota Law School, Walz declared ICE ""Donald Trump's modern-day Gestapo.""

""They're in unmarked vans wearing masks, being shipped off to foreign torture dungeons [with] no chance to mount a defense,"" Walz said.

""To be clear: there's no way for us to know whether they were actually criminals or not, because they refused to give them a trial.""

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin directly blamed Walz' specific rhetoric as helping lead to a 413% increase in assaults on federal immigration officers as of May.

GOV GAVIN NEWSOM: TRUMP IS TRYING TO DESTROY OUR DEMOCRACY. DO NOT LET HIM

Bass accused ICE and the Trump homeland security apparatus of conducting a ""reign of terror"" in America's second-largest city.

She told ABC News at the time of the ICE riots in her city that they ""did not warrant the Marines coming into our city with basically no real mission but just a show of force.""

""I'm hoping the military leaves because they were never needed here to begin with.""

Johnson said in June that America under Trump looks more like the C.S.A. than the U.S.A., comparing federal immigration enforcement to ""terrorism.""

He said at his weekly presser that when he refers to ""what terrorism looks like, this is it,"" and that there is a ""tyrant in the White House.""

Johnson said the federal government is operating as a ""one-branch"" authority, and that checks and balances have been mooted by Trump – whom he accused of taking over the judiciary and wielding executive power as a cudgel against critics.

""They are hypocrites. They're dangerous. There's one branch of government right now in this country… the Congress says nothing. And so people are terrified. But in the city of Chicago, we are going to remain vigilant and firm in protecting what is sensible about our existence,"" Brandon Johnson went on.

After ICE operations in his district in late August, Larson called federal immigration forces ""Trump's personal secret police.""

""This is not Germany. That is the SS and the Gestapo. This is the United States of America. Unmask yourselves.""

In a statement after the situation drew national attention, Larson said ICE wrongly ""took workers from Newington and Southington without notifying local officials, even tearing two mothers from their children.""

""Now, [Trump] is attacking me for defending them. This comes from a president who freed violent insurrectionists that assaulted and killed police, while he weaponizes the government against immigrant families and his political enemies,"" he said.

Larson appeared to get backup from Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, who said in a statement at the time that, ""if I know one thing about John Larson, he will not be silenced.""

Dozens of Democratic officials have been arrested while protesting ICE, especially in New York.

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams were detained in Manhattan last week, along with several state lawmakers.

Local media listed several Democratic state lawmakers, including Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Phara Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Tiffany Caban, Tony Simone and Marcela Mitaynes as others detained or confronted by police at the same demonstration.

Earlier this year, Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., was arrested along with Newark Mayor Ras Baraka after several lawmakers attempted to gain access to the ICE facility in the Brick City.

After the Manhattan incident, McLaughlin called out Lander as being ""obsess[ed]"" with ""attacking the brave men and women of law enforcement, physically and rhetorically.""

""[He] must stop now.""

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is once again sparking campaign buzz for participating in an advertisement advocating California redistricting. 

""Trump is redrawing maps to force a Congress that only answers to him — not the people,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., said while posting a viral video of Ocasio-Cortez on X. ""@AOC knows California can stop him with Prop 50.""

California voters will decide during November's special election whether to temporarily redraw new congressional district maps in response to President Donald Trump successfully urging Gov. Greg Abbott and Texas Republicans to secure five additional Republican-leaning districts through their own redistricting process. 

""Prop 50 levels the playing field and gives power back to the people,"" the New York Democrat said in the ad, urging Californians to ""fight for democracy in all 50 states"" by voting ""yes on 50.""

If passed, Prop 50 would allow California's Democratic supermajority to redraw its congressional districts to secure five more Democrat-leaning congressional districts, leveling the playing field against Texas redistricting. More states, including Missouri and Ohio, have their own redistricting plans ahead of competitive midterm elections expected in 2026. 

""California, you know we don't back down from a fight,"" the New York Democrat said in the ad. ""And this November, the fight belongs to you.""

NEWSOM UNVEILING CALIFORNIA REDISTRICTING EFFORT TO COUNTER TRUMP-BACKED PUSH IN TEXAS

The video has been viewed by more than 2 million people in the 24 hours since Newsom posted it. 

""Seven years in, some politicians are *finally* understanding why bringing @AOC into our fight is a good thing!"" Democratic strategist Rebecca Katz responded on X.

The Bronx representative also appears in a Spanish version of the ad, which was paid for by Yes on 50. 

""Donald Trump is redrawing election maps to force through a Congress that only answers to him, not the people. If he gets away with it, all bets are off for our healthcare, our paychecks and our freedoms. With Prop 50, we can stop him,"" she said, looking directly into the camera.

The California Republican Party criticized Newsom for ""relying on a New Yorker"" to ""tell Californians how to vote.""

""It's part of their disturbing pattern: silence the debate, control the outcome, and erase the people who think differently. Don't let them rig the system. Vote NO on Prop 50!"" California Republicans said on X. 

Meanwhile, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is trying to terminate California Democrats' redistricting fight.

The ad was released on the heels of an Axios' report saying Ocasio-Cortez's team is positioning her for a 2028 presidential or U.S. Senate run. 

Former Vice President Kamala Harris made apparent jabs at her potential 2028 presidential opponents in her new book, ""107 Days,"" which was released Tuesday. ""Hiking. Will call back. (He never did.)"" was Newsom's response when Harris reached out after President Joe Biden suspended his re-election campaign, according to the book.

But Harris only had positive words for Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. 

""AOC goes deep into policy but has a lightness with people, a joyful warrior vibe,"" Harris said in the book. ""Her talent for deconstructing complex issues and her commitment to getting justice for working people make her an invaluable leader in this moment.""

Ocasio-Cortez sparked plenty of campaign buzz earlier this year when she joined Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on his widely popular ""Fighting Oligarchy"" tour. 

In April, Ocasio-Cortez's campaign account posted a video on X that invigorated rumors she could be mulling a presidential run as the four-term Democrat from New York City and the progressive leader proclaimed, ""We are one.""

When asked later that month if she was harboring any presidential ambitions, the young Democrat did not rule out 2028 presidential aspirations to Fox News Digital. 

The momentum around Ocasio-Cortez comes as Democrats are searching for new party leadership following consequential losses up and down the ballot in 2024.

Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders have both endorsed and supported New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's campaign despite establishment Democrats' reluctance to embrace the self-identified Democratic socialist's platform. 

Newsom and Ocasio-Cortez did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Fox News correspondent Brooke Taylor reports on a shooting outside of an ICE facility in Dallas as former FBI investigator Bill Daly weighs in on the rise of politically motivated violence. 

At least three people were shot, two of whom were killed, in a shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas on Wednesday, Fox News confirmed.

The FBI says it is investigating the incident as a ""targeted attack"" against ICE, and multiple sources familiar with the investigation have identified the alleged shooter as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn. Representatives for the FBI at a Wednesday morning press conference in Dallas said that preliminary investigations uncovered anti-ICE messaging on bullet rounds found near the shooter.

The shooting reportedly occurred as ICE officers were transferring detainees into the facility. The shooter died due to a self-inflicted wound shortly after the attack, authorities say. The three individuals who were shot were all detainees, and two of them have died.

The three detainees were shot while inside a law enforcement van, ICE sources told Fox News' Brooke Taylor.

Authorities say Jahn fired on the facility from a nearby rooftop, striking both the van and other parts of the ICE facility.

""These despicable, politically motivated attacks against law enforcement are not a one-off. We are only miles from Prarieland Texas where just two months ago an individual ambushed a separate ICE facility targeting their officers. It has to end and the FBI and our partners will lead the these investigative efforts to see to it that those who target our law enforcement are pursued and brought to the fullest extent of justice,"" FBI director Kash Patel wrote on X.

Authorities say Patel was in Dallas for a ""prescheduled visit"" on Wednesday morning. The FBI says he visited law enforcement at the ""incident command location"" following the attack.

The Dallas Police Department sources told Fox News the shooting occurred at roughly 6:30 a.m. local time. They say no law enforcement officers were injured, but that three detainees were shot and two were killed.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed there were ""multiple fatalities.""

""There was a shooting this morning at the Dallas ICE Detention Facility,"" Noem wrote on X. ""Details are still emerging but we can confirm there were multiple injuries and fatalities. The shooter is deceased by a self-inflicted gunshot wound.""

""While we don't know motive yet, we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them. It must stop. Please pray for the victims and their families,"" she added.

Authorities say the shooter opened fire when the sally port to the facility was open during the transfer of detainees, attempting to force his way in.

Multiple people were shot and killed in an ""attack"" on an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas on Wednesday, September 24, 2025. 

""The obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop. I'm praying for everyone hurt in this attack and for their families,"" Vice President JD Vance wrote on X.

DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughin noted during an appearance on Fox News that it was ""just a month ago to the day that there was a viable bomb threat"" in Dallas.

""So this location, it looks like it's been targeted, and we don't know how long this individual has been planning this act. It looks like he could have been watching to look at the processing and see what happens on a day-to-day basis at this Dallas field office. But [these are] all answers that Homeland Security investigation is going to get down to the bottom of,"" McLaughlin added.

She reiterated calls for critics of ICE to tone down their rhetoric after the attack.

""We don't want to get anyone killed,"" she said.

Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Texas, who represents the district containing the ICE facility, said his office is aware of the shooting and is monitoring the situation.

""We are keeping the victims in prayer and will update the North Texas community as we get news on their conditions and learn more about the suspect,"" Veasey wrote on X.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott reacted to the attack on Wednesday, framing it as an ""assassination.

""Texas fully supports ICE,"" Abbott wrote. ""Both the Texas Dept. of Public Safety & Texas National Guard work closely with ICE. This assassination will NOT slow our arrest, detention, and deportation of illegal immigrants. We will work with ICE and the Dallas Police Dept. to get to the bottom of the assassin's motive. We will offer ICE additional support to assist their operations,"" he added.

More than 100 people have died in the flooding and more than 160 are believed to be missing.  

Camp Mystic, a long-running private Christian girls' summer camp where 27 girls and counselors died in Texas flooding on the Fourth of July, will reopen next year, according to the camp's operators.

The camp will reopen in conjunction with its 100th anniversary and one year after the deadly flash floods that swept through the site along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County this summer.

The summer camp made the announcement on Monday in an email to families enrolled in the 2025 camp. Some families have criticized the camp over its safety measures and preparedness in the wake of the tragedy.

Leaders said they will reopen Camp Mystic Cypress Lake, a sister site opened in 2020 that was not destroyed by the flood. The original campus, which is located along the Guadalupe River and suffered ""devastating damage,"" will remain closed, and is not expected to reopen next year, officials added.

""As we work to finalize plans, we will do so in a way that is mindful of those we have lost,"" the letter said, according to The Associated Press.

The owners said they will be designing and building a memorial ""dedicated to the lives of the campers and counselors lost on July 4th,"" according to ABC News.

""We hope this space will serve as a place of reflection and remembrance of these beautiful girls,"" the camp's statement read. ""We continue to pray for the grieving families and all those who lost loved ones.""

The letter also said leaders are working with engineers and other experts to determine how the camp will implement safety changes required under newly passed state laws.

Fox News Digital has reached out to Camp Mystic for comment.

FAITH BRINGS LIGHT TO DEVASTATED TEXAS TOWN AFTER DEADLY FLOODING DISASTER

The news has drawn a mixed reaction. Some family members of the deceased strongly oppose the planned reopening, while alumni and the Eastland family, who own the property, have expressed support.

Cici Steward, whose 8-year-old daughter, Cile, remains missing, said, ""The truth is, Camp Mystic failed our daughters.

""For my family, these months have felt like an eternity. For the camp, it seems like nothing more than a brief pause before business as usual,"" she added in a statement Tuesday to The New York Times. ""Camp Mystic is pressing ahead with reopening, even if it means inviting girls to swim in the same river that may potentially still hold my daughter's body.""

Other parents said they had received almost no other communication from the camp in the months after the flood, then were suddenly notified by email that Mystic planned to reopen.

Blake Bonner, whose 9-year-old daughter, Lila, died in the flooding, told the Times the families were not consulted about, nor did they approve the memorial the camp announced.

The campers and counselors were killed when the fast-rising floodwaters roared through a low-lying area of the summer camp before dawn on July 4, 2025. 

The destructive flooding killed at least 136 people in the region, prompting widespread criticism of local preparedness. 

County leaders were asleep or out of town, the AP reported. The head of Camp Mystic had been tracking the weather beforehand, but it's unclear whether he saw an urgent warning from the National Weather Service that had triggered an emergency alert to phones in the area, a spokesperson for the camp's operators said in the immediate aftermath.

The camp, established in 1926, did not evacuate and was hit hard when the river rose from 14 feet to 29.5 feet within 60 minutes.

White House 'border czar' Tom Homan discusses California Gov. Gavin Newsom's law banning masks for law enforcement, the deportation operations and responds to bribery allegations on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Federal officials are making an example of a Santa Monica man arrested this week for allegedly doxxing and harassing an ICE attorney, with the architect of Los Angeles' and Chicago's raids warning any copycats.

Gregory Curcio faces up to five years in prison if convicted, after the Justice Department said he allegedly published private or identifying information about an ICE attorney ""with malicious intent.""

ICE Operation ""At Large"" Commander Gregory Bovino tweeted overnight that anyone who targets immigration officers like Curcio should take notice.

""Dox our agents? You'll end up being charged just like this man found out,"" said Bovino, whose noted social media presence and prominent public persona have been both a cause célèbre for supporters of President Donald Trump's mass deportation agenda, and a source of outrage for liberal opponents.

Bill Essayli, the Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney for Central California, took the message one step further.

Essayli said Curcio's arrest proves why ICE agents must be allowed to shield their identity, which now conflicts with a recently-passed California law banning law enforcement from doing so.

Essayli, a Republican and the first Muslim elected to the California State Assembly, lambasted critics of federal agents who mask-up during public operations.

""Why do our agents wear masks? Gregory John Curcio, 68, of Santa Monica was arrested and charged today with doxxing an ICE attorney,"" Essayli said in a statement on social media.

""We will not tolerate the harassment -- online or otherwise -- of federal law enforcement,"" he added.

""We will find and arrest those who release personal information of federal agents or their families. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty in court.""

The Justice Department said Curcio was arrested Monday and appeared Tuesday before a federal judge in Los Angeles who ordered him jailed without bond ahead of an October arraignment.

""Contrary to what some misguided individuals think, doxxing federal agents and employees is not a harmless crime,"" Essayli added in a Justice Department statement.

""It endangers the agent's personal safety and that of their family.""

Prosecutors say Curcio posted an ICE attorney's home address in February and urged others to ""SWAT"" her — a term for making false 911 calls to provoke an armed law enforcement response.

FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ARREST OHIO MAN FOR ALLEGEDLY THREATENING TO MURDER ICE AGENTS

The attorney claimed to police she had never met the suspect but that he once lived in an apartment building owned by her mother, and that he would harass the parent as far back as January 2024.

ICE's Office of Responsibility is also investigating the case.

On Saturday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the first-in-the-nation law prohibiting most law enforcement from obscuring their faces during official business.

It was seen as a direct response to raids in Los Angeles engineered by Bovino, which resulted in mass protests from the left and widespread praise from the right and at the White House, where President Donald Trump federalized the California National Guard and deployed assets to America's second-largest city.

Newsom said Saturday that the diversity that ""makes California great"" is ""under assault,"" while adding the impact of the Trump administration's policies across the Golden State is ""terrifying.""

""It's like a dystopian sci-fi movie. Unmarked cars, people in masks, people quite literally disappearing. No due process, no rights, no rights in a democracy where we have rights. Immigrants have rights, and we have the right to stand up and push back,"" Newsom said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Time for Trump to recognize Somaliland","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3818286/trump-somaliland-united-nations-speech-new-york/","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom formally recognized a Palestinian state. Their collective action both rewarded Hamas terrorism — notably, Hamas still holds its Jewish hostages — and shredded the basis of previously negotiated agreements that tied recognition to Palestinian acceptance of Israel and foreswearing of terrorism. Frankly, Israel would now be legally within its rights to permanently reoccupy Gaza and turn the clock back to pre-1993.

The Australian, Canadian, and British leadership seek to pander to their own increasingly radical constituencies, though they will couch their rhetoric in the logic of building momentum. The U.K.'s willingness to recognize a Palestinian state is also a deliberate finger in the eye of President Donald Trump. He should certainly see it as such.

TRUMP AND BRITAIN SPLIT ON GAZA

It is no longer the 19th century, and so British recognition of a Palestinian state, let alone that of Canada and Australia, means absolutely nothing. Contrary to arguments that Israel “occupies” Gaza, the would-be state has never been a stand-alone entity. Control over disputed territories passed from the Ottomans to the British to the Jordanians and Egyptians. It is telling that neither Jordan nor Egypt recognized the West Bank and Gaza as a Palestinian state. Most Palestinians came from outside the region, as early 20th-century censuses show.

If Canberra, Ottawa, and London — the Axis of Pandering — wish to promote a Palestinian state, Washington should lead by moral clarity: It should recognize Somaliland.

Consider the two cases: Hyperventilating progressives citing Hamas aside, there has been no genocide, let alone starvation, in Gaza. Major newspapers shamed themselves by posting photos of cerebral palsy victims and those with other severe conditions, seeking to deceive audiences into believing they represent ordinary Gazans. Some pre-cropped photos even show fat terrorists in the background. Meanwhile, there has been a real and documented genocide in Somaliland, where Somali forces under dictator Siad Barre sought to eradicate the Isaaq clan.

Unlike Gaza, Somaliland has a long history as an entity and can actually trace its rulers back centuries. In 1960, approximately 30 countries recognized its independence. It subsequently chose union with Italian Somaliland, a marriage that failed spectacularly because of Siad Barre. Since 1991, Somaliland reclaimed its independence, though it remains unrecognized. Somaliland has governed itself for longer than it was part of Somalia.

While the Palestinian Authority and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency are essentially elaborate money laundering operations, Somaliland has built a functioning country without any meaningful international aid. While Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, serves his 20th year of a four-year term, Somaliland elects its leaders regularly, becoming the first nation in the world to use biometric iris scans to secure voter registration and prevent fraud.

AMERICA IS REPEATING ITS SOMALIA MISTAKES IN YEMEN

Most importantly, while Palestinians extort money and leverage sympathy based on their own terrorism, Somaliland has built a democratic culture that invests money into infrastructure rather than terrorist tunnels.

When Trump takes the podium in New York, he should show the world that he truly stands for freedom, liberty, and decolonization rather than violence, antisemitism, and terrorism. He should announce the formal U.S. recognition of Somaliland and tell the Palestinians that they will achieve their state only when they follow the Somaliland model. There can be no shortcuts or legitimization of terrorism.

TRUMP'S EPIC UN ADDRESS. How to describe President Donald Trump's speech to the United Nations on Tuesday? Epic, extraordinary, unprecedented — whatever term you prefer, Trump's address was a sledgehammer of a message delivered to allies and adversaries around the world.

The most striking passages were directed at allies, particularly those in Europe, and they focused on two enormously consequential and controversial issues that Trump called a “double-tailed monster”: migration and energy. 

Start with migration. Trump was speaking from a position of strength, having put a quick stop to the out-of-control border influx of the Biden years, in which millions crossed illegally into the United States. He virtually begged Europe to get its own migration levels under control. But instead of discussing Trump's remarks, perhaps it would be better just to quote them at length. So if you haven't already had a chance to read or listen to them, here is what the president said about migration:

Not only is the U.N. not solving the problems it should, too often, it's actually creating new problems for us to solve. The best example is the No. 1 political issue of our time: the crisis of uncontrolled migration. It's uncontrolled. Your countries are being ruined. The United Nations is funding an assault on Western countries and their borders. In 2024, the U.N. budgeted $372 million in cash assistance to support an estimated 624,000 migrants journeying into the United States. Think of that, the U.N. is supporting people that are illegally coming into the United States, and then we have to get them out. The U.N. also provided food, shelter, transportation, and debit cards to illegal aliens, can you believe that, on the way to infiltrate our southern border.

Millions of people came through that southern border. Just a year ago, millions and millions of people were pouring in, 25 million altogether over the four years of the incompetent Biden administration, and now we have it stopped. Totally stopped. In fact, they're not even coming anymore because they know they can't get through. But what took place is totally unacceptable. The U.N. is supposed to stop invasions, not create them and not finance them. In the United States, we reject the idea that mass numbers of people from foreign lands can be permitted to travel halfway around the world, trample our borders, violate our sovereignty, cause unmitigated crime, and deplete our social safety net.

We have reasserted that America belongs to the American people, and I encourage all countries to take their own stand in defense of their citizens as well. You have to do that because I see it — I'm not mentioning names. I see it, and I can call every single one of them out. You're destroying your countries. They're being destroyed. Europe is in serious trouble. They've been invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody's ever seen before. Illegal aliens are pouring into Europe, and nobody's doing anything to change it, to get them out. It's not sustainable. And because they choose to be politically correct, they're doing just absolutely nothing about it.

And I have to say, I look at London, where you have a terrible mayor, a terrible, terrible mayor, and it's been so changed, so changed. Now they want to go to Sharia law, but you're in a different country, you can't do that. Both the immigration and their suicidal energy ideas will be the death of Western Europe if something is not done immediately. This cannot be sustained. What makes the world so beautiful is that each country is unique, but to stay this way, every sovereign nation must have the right to control their own borders. You have the right to control your borders, as we do now, and to limit the sheer numbers of migrants entering their countries and paid for by the people of that nation that were there and that built that particular nation at the time. They put their blood, sweat, tears, money into that country, and now they're being ruined.

Proud nations must be allowed to protect their communities and prevent their societies from being overwhelmed by people they have never seen before with different customs, religions, with different everything. Where migrants have violated laws, lodged false asylum claims, or claimed refugee status for illegitimate reasons, they should, in many cases, be immediately sent home. And while we will always have a big heart for places and people that are struggling and truly compassionate, answers will be given. We have to solve the problem, and we have to solve it in their countries, not create new problems in our countries. And we are very helpful to a lot of countries that are just not able to send their people anymore. They used to send them to us in caravans of 25, 30,000 people each, these massive caravans of people pouring into our country, totally unchecked and unvetted, but not anymore.

According to the Council of Europe, in 2024, almost 50% of inmates in German prisons were foreign nationals or migrants. In Austria, the number was 53% of the people in prisons were from places that weren't from where they are now. In Greece, the number was 54%. And in Switzerland, beautiful Switzerland, 72% of the people in prisons are from outside of Switzerland. When your prisons are filled with so-called asylum-seekers who repaid kindness, and that's what they did, they repaid kindness with crime, it's time to end the failed experiment of open borders. You have to end it now. I see it, I can tell you.

I'm really good at this stuff. Your countries are going to hell. In America, we've taken bold action to swiftly shut down uncontrolled migration. Once we started detaining and deporting everyone who crossed the border and removing illegal aliens from the United States, they simply stopped coming. They're not coming anymore. We're getting a lot of credit, but they're not coming anymore. 

Then, energy. Trump has long warned Europeans not to abandon older forms of energy production — coal, oil, and nuclear — in favor of untested and unreliable forms of renewables, such as wind and solar. At the U.N., he urged Europe to turn away from sources of green energy that not only can't be depended on but in the end can make Western Europe more dependent on bad actors, such as Russia, for conventional energy. That part of Trump's speech was one long admonition:

Energy is another area where the United States is now thriving like never before. We're getting rid of the falsely named renewables. By the way, they're a joke. They don't work. They're too expensive. They're not strong enough to fire up the plants that you need to make your country great. The wind doesn't blow. Those big windmills are so pathetic and so bad, so expensive to operate, and they have to be rebuilt all the time, and they start to rust and rot. Most expensive energy ever conceived. And it's actually energy — you're supposed to make money with energy, not lose money. You lose money, the governments have to subsidize. You can't put them out without massive subsidies. And most of them are built in China, and I give China a lot of credit. They build them, but they have very few wind farms. So why is it that they build them and they send them all over the world, but they barely use them? You know what? They use coal, they use gas, they use almost anything, but they don't like wind, but they sure as hell like selling the windmills.

Europe, on the other hand, has a long way to go, with many countries being on the brink of destruction because of the green energy agenda. And I give a lot of credit to Germany. Germany was being led down a very sick path, both on immigration, by the way, and on energy. They were going green, and they were going bankrupt. And the new leadership came in, and they went back to where they were with fossil fuel and with nuclear, which is good, it's now safe, and you can do it properly. But they went back to where they were, and they opened up a lot of different plants, energy plants, energy-producing plants, and they're doing well. I give Germany a lot of credit for that. They've said, “This is a disaster. What's happening?” They were going all green. All green is all bankrupt. That's what it represents.

And it's not politically correct. I'll be very badly criticized for saying it, but I'm here to tell the truth. I don't care. It doesn't matter to me. … They've given up their powerful edge, a lot of the countries that we're talking about in oil and gas, such as essentially closing the great North Sea oil. Oh, the North Sea. I know it so well. Aberdeen was the oil capital of Europe, and this tremendous oil that hasn't been found in the North Sea. Tremendous oil. And I was with the prime minister I respected, like a lot. And I said, “You're sitting with the greatest asset.” They essentially closed it by making it so highly taxed that no developer, no oil company can go there. They have tremendous oil left and, more importantly, they have tremendous oil that hasn't even been found yet.

And what a tremendous asset for the United Kingdom. And I hope the prime minister's listening because I told it to him three days in a row. That's all he heard. North Sea oil, North Sea, because I want to see them do well. I want to stop seeing them ruining that beautiful Scottish and English countryside with windmills and massive solar panels that go 7 miles by 7 miles, taken away farmland, but we're not letting this happen in America. In 1982, the executive director of the United Nations Environmental Program predicted that by the year 2000, climate change would cause a global catastrophe. He said that it will be irreversible as any nuclear holocaust would be. This is what they said at the United Nations. What happened? Here we are. Another U.N. official stated in 1989 that within a decade, entire nations could be wiped off the map by global warming. Not happening.

It used to be global cooling. If you look back years ago in the 1920s and the 1930s, they said, “Global cooling will kill the world. We have to do something.” Then they said global warming will kill the world. But then it started getting cooler. So now they could just call it climate change because that way, they can't miss. It's climate change because if it goes higher or lower, whatever the hell happens, it's climate change. It's the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion. Climate change, no matter what happens, you're involved in that. No more global warming, no more global cooling. All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong. They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don't get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.

And I'm really good at predicting things. They actually said during the campaign, they had a hat, the bestselling hat. Trump was right about everything. And I don't say that in a braggadocious way, but it's true. I've been right about everything. And I'm telling you that if you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail. And if you don't stop people that you've never seen before, that you have nothing in common with, your country is going to fail. I'm the president of the United States, but I worry about Europe. I love Europe. I love the people of Europe, and I hate to see it being devastated by energy and immigration. This double-tailed monster destroys everything in its wake, and they cannot let that happen any longer. You're doing it because you want to be nice, you want to be politically correct, and you're destroying your heritage.

They must take control strongly and immediately of the unmitigated immigration disaster and the fake energy catastrophe before it's too late. The carbon footprint is a hoax made up by people with evil intentions, and they're heading down a path of total destruction. … At extreme cost and expense, Europe reduced its own carbon footprint by 37%. Think of that. Congratulations, Europe. Great job. You cost yourself a lot of jobs, a lot of factories closed, but you reduced the carbon footprint by 37%. However, for all of that sacrifice and much more, it's been totally wiped out and then some by a global increase of 54%, much of it coming from China and other countries that are thriving around China, which now produces more CO2 than all the other developed nations in the world. So all of these countries are working so hard on the carbon footprint, which is nonsense by the way. It's nonsense. It's interesting. In the United States, we have still radicalized environmentalists, and they want the factories to stop. Everything should stop. No more cows. We don't want cows anymore. I guess they want to kill all the cows. They want to do things that are just unbelievable, and you have it too.

But we have a border, strong, and we have a shape, and that shape doesn't just go straight up. That shape is amorphous when it comes to the atmosphere. And if we had the most clean air, and I think we do, we have very clean air, we have the cleanest air we've had in many, many years. But the problem is that other countries like China, which has air that's a little bit rough, it blows. And no matter what you're doing down here, the air up here tends to get very dirty because it comes in from other countries where their air isn't so clean, and the environmentalists refuse to acknowledge that. Same thing with garbage.

In Asia, they dump much of their garbage right into the ocean. And over about a one-week and two-week journey, it flows right past Los Angeles. You've seen it: massive amounts of garbage. Almost too much to do anything about, flowing past Los Angeles, past San Francisco, and then somebody would get in trouble because he dropped a cigarette on the beach. The whole thing is crazy. The primary effect of these brutal green energy policies has not been to help the environment, but to redistribute manufacturing and industrial activity from developed countries that follow the insane rules that are put down to polluting countries that break the rules and are making a fortune. They're making a fortune.

European electricity bills are now four to five times more expensive than those in China, and two to three times higher than the United States, and our bills are coming way down. You probably see that. Our gasoline prices are way down. We have an expression: “Drill, baby, drill.” And that's what we're doing. We're going to be much lower a year from now. But they've come way down over the last year. As a result, every air conditioner — it's very uncommon to see one in some of these countries because the electric costs are so high. So while the U.S. has approximately 1,300 heat-related deaths annually, that's a lot, Europe loses more than 175,000 people to heat deaths each year because the costs are so expensive you can't turn on an air conditioner. What is that all about? That's not the Europe that I love and know — all in the name of pretending to stop the global warming hoax. The entire globalist concept of asking successful industrialized nations to inflict pain on themselves and radically disrupt their entire societies must be rejected completely and totally, and it must be immediate.

That's why in America, I withdrew from the fake Paris Climate Accords, where, by the way, America was paying so much more than every country. Others weren't paying. China didn't have to pay until 2030. Russia was given an old standard that was easy to meet, a 1990 standard. But for the United States, we're supposed to pay like a trillion dollars. And I said, “This is another scam.” The fact is the United States has been taken advantage of by the world for many, many years, but not any longer, as you probably noticed.

I unleashed massive energy production and signed historic executive orders to hunt for oil. But we don't have to do much hunting because we have the most oil of any nation, anywhere, oil and gas in the world. And if you add coal, we have the most of any nation in the world. Clean. I call it clean, beautiful coal. You can do things today with coal that you couldn't have done 10 years ago, 15 years. So I have a little standing order in the White House. Never use the word coal, only use the words clean, beautiful coal. Sounds much better, doesn't it? But we stand ready to provide any country with abundant, affordable energy supplies if you need them, when most of you do.

There was more to Trump's address, such as nuclear weapons and other issues of war and peace. But Trump's warning about the “double-tailed monster” could stand alone as a great, and likely unheeded, warning to Europe.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Former Vice President Kamala Harris has been under fire from all sides since she released her book on her 2024 run for president.

But few have knocked her to the mat faster than former Tennessee Democratic Rep. Harold Ford Jr. did Tuesday night while appearing on Fox News's Special Report hosted by Bret Baier.

After a discussion about Harris's new book, 107 Days, Baier asked Ford if he believed she was planning to run for president again in 2028. Ford deadpanned, “It doesn't matter.”

Ford — an executive in New York's financial world, a regular Special Report contributor, and co-host of The Five — was very critical of Harris for burning bridges with Democratic governors and former President Joe Biden in her book.

“The title of this book should have been ‘Thank you,' because the party gave her the nomination,” Ford said.

“If you're going to write a book and you want to have a political future, look forward. You can look back in the context of how you should look forward and maybe admit some miscalculations during the campaign, but here's what Democrats should be doing now. And anybody who is serious about running for president, 2028, should be doing these things. This is not a useful exercise for her or for my party,” Ford added.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Trump and his powerful friends are creating a dangerous moment for free speech.

American mass media has been transformed in these early months of President Donald Trump's second administration. We're about 35 weeks into a term that will last for 173 more, and in that time, we have seen a tech titan gut a once-great newspaper in an apparent act of capitulation to the commander in chief, government accounts gleefully spreading hateful memes on X (the far-right platform owned by a billionaire tech oligarch), a defamation lawsuit filed by Trump against The New York Times (and quickly dismissed by the judge as “superfluous”), and, of course, the assault on free speech carried out by Trump's Federal Communications Commission chairman. Big things can happen very quickly.



Here is what seems to be next: TikTok's U.S. operations are reportedly on the cusp of being sold to a group that includes Trump allies, led by yet another tech baron, Larry Ellison. Although the deal is not yet complete, the White House has told reporters that the arrangement will result in the social app's algorithm being leased to a consortium led by Ellison's company, Oracle, and by the investors Andreessen Horowitz and Silver Lake. This promises to resolve long-standing concerns that the Chinese-owned TikTok might give an adversarial foreign government the capacity to influence and monitor the social-media behavior of U.S. residents. But at the rate things are going today, we should be far less worried about what foreign governments could do with our social-media information than about how our own government might abuse it. (A spokesperson for the White House did not respond to my request for comment.)

Martin Baron: Where Jeff Bezos went wrong with The Washington Post

Five years ago, Trump signed an executive order warning Americans about the potential for TikTok to be used as a dangerous surveillance tool. He wrote then that the app's “data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information—potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.” This warning is warranted, to a degree. President Xi Jinping would probably have a hard time engineering the downfall of America through the media served on TikTok, where it's always been more likely that you'll encounter waves of brain rot rather than anything that seems like genuine mind control, but the potential for digital surveillance through social media is very real.



Apart from its Chinese ownership, TikTok is not much different from Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and X. Each of these platforms has an opaque algorithm that determines the content that users will see. The algorithm manipulates users, but primarily with the goal of keeping them on the platform and seeing more advertisements. The platforms also gather compendiums of data on what we view, like, share, and comment on. The U.S. has taken the position that these practices are a massive threat when a social-media platform is under foreign ownership, but it has been willing to allow them when the manipulation and surveillance take place within our own national boundaries.



There has been no indication that Trump or his administration would have direct control over the platform. But with close allies in command, it would seem that there's a clear line for the president to influence and bend the platform to his will. One thing that social-media platforms are already tremendously adept at is building “look-alike” models of users. This was Facebook's big advertising breakthrough a decade ago—the 2016 Trump campaign figured out how to acquire donors by showing campaign ads to people with similar social-media likes and preferences as the existing base of MAGA supporters. What happens if social media's data-gathering and profiling engine is turned not to selling merch or promoting political rhetoric, but to profiling enemies? Just this week, Trump issued an executive order designating “Antifa” as a domestic terrorist organization (despite the fact that antifa is not an organization at all). Imagine if the administration asks its newly anointed TikTok leadership to pinpoint a set of supposedly hateful, far-left media outlets, and then generate lists of social-media users who view, share, and comment on such media. Or imagine if it asks Ellison et al. to identify clusters of people who view and share videos attacking ICE, criticizing “Alligator Alcatraz,” or protecting the undocumented. Look-alike models are a danger in the hands of a budding authoritarian state.



Oracle did not immediately respond to my request for comment, and Ellison will certainly not be the only one in charge of TikTok if the deal goes through as planned. His company is just one of three named investors, and there would be a board of directors—but it's a safe bet that anyone given power here would be viewed by the Trump administration as friendly. And Ellison has offered some relevant perspectives on key issues. Last year, he boasted to Oracle investors about the potential for harnessing artificial intelligence for panoptic surveillance: “Citizens will be on their best behavior because we're constantly recording and reporting everything that is going on,” Ellison, who serves as the company's chief technology officer and executive chairman, remarked. “It's unimpeachable.” Ellison has also said that countries should try to “unify” as much data as possible to allow that information to be used by AI; the Trump administration appeared to be making such efforts earlier this year through DOGE.

Read: American panopticon

The protections of the First Amendment are supposed to guarantee that Americans have little to fear from U.S. government surveillance and manipulation. But that is an ever-quainter assurance. Just look at how many public officials responded to social-media chatter over the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the country would deny visas to anyone “celebrating” Kirk's death. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau directed government officials to “take appropriate action” against anyone “making light of” Kirk's untimely demise. And ABC abruptly suspended Jimmy Kimmel Live after FCC Chairman Brendan Carr appeared on a right-wing podcast and declared, “We can do this the easy or the hard way,” in response to Kimmel's insinuation that the alleged shooter may have been part of the “MAGA gang.” (Kimmel's show is now back, though Nexstar and Sinclair, major broadcast-station owners, said that they would not air it.) As the Atlantic staff writer David Frum put it on X, “It's not about ‘cancel culture' because it's not about ‘culture.' It's about a threat of legal retaliation by a government agency for not obeying a government edict. It's state repression, not social sanction.”

The Onion had a joke headline last week: “Report: You to Be Fired for Reading This Headline About Charlie Kirk.” The U.S. government cannot currently target you for watching the wrong programs or laughing at the wrong jokes. It does not currently have the capacity for that sort of surveillance at scale. But it sure seems that it would like to.

In an ideal world, Congress would establish a regulatory framework for all online platforms, regardless of ownership, requiring algorithmic auditing and placing reasonable limits on digital surveillance and data collection. This should have happened a long time ago. But we don't live in an ideal world. We're stuck living in this one.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Late-night show hosts are sending a message to Trump: They'll be thorns in his side for as long as they can be","https://www.businessinsider.com/late-night-show-hosts-versus-trump-jimmy-kimmel-stephen-colbert-2025-9","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 06:51:00 GMT","

The arena of late-night comedy is a cutthroat one, with warring timeslots and competing comedians jockeying for a slice of the viewership pie. But when one of their own is threatened, the pack rises to the occasion.

We saw that this week when ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" got hit with a suspension from ABC following his comments on the killing of the conservative podcaster Charlie Kirk. And that happened, too, when ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" was scheduled for cancellation.

For a hot minute this week, when ABC appeared to cave to pressure from the chair of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, President Donald Trump looked to be gaining ground in his war on late-night comedy. The president hasn't been shy about how much talk-show hosts and comedians annoy him. He has called them talentless and urged their networks to fire them.

Yet they're still here — for now — and they won't shut up.

Jon Stewart, the longtime late-night great, approached the Kimmel issue head-on in two monologues in the past week. On Thursday's episode of 'The Daily Show,"" he put on a satire-laden dedication to America's ""great leader"" Trump, blasting the administration's stance on free speech.

And on Monday, Stewart went all-in with his commentary on Trump. In his monologue, he joked about the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, an ongoing PR nightmare for the Trump administration. Then he issued a rallying call for people to ""fight like hell"" to defend ""our constitutional republic,"" a signal that the work is far from done regardless of Kimmel's return.

On John Oliver's Sunday episode of ""Last Week Tonight,"" he acknowledged that he isn't bound to some of the limitations his fellow network-based comedians are because HBO airs his show. The British-born comedian took advantage of that freedom to deliver a half-hour dissection of the Kimmel chaos.

Kimmel is ""by no means the first casualty in Trump's attacks on free speech,"" he said.

""He's just the latest canary in the coal mine,"" Oliver said. ""A mine that at this point now seems more dead canary than coal.""

And, of course, there were laughs as well on Tuesday night.

The soon-to-be-canceled Colbert returned to regular programming during much of his monologue. He dedicated his airtime to ridiculing Trump's performance at the UN General Assembly. Then he poked fun at the president's pronunciation of the word ""acetaminophen"" and called Trump's claims about Tylenol and pregnancy ""crazy.""

The joke train kept rolling over at ""The Daily Show,"" where Stewart's colleague Jordan Klepper made more jokes about Trump's joint press conference with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

As for Kimmel, his triumphant return to late-night came with its share of emotional moments. He clarified that he never meant to make light of Kirk's death. He also sent love to Kirk's family, as he had in a social media post that predated the fracas.

Then he pivoted and threw punch after punch at Trump and Carr.

""This show is not important. What is important is that we get to live in a country that allows us to have a show like this,"" Kimmel said.

Kimmel added, too, that he was lucky to live in a country where freedom of speech is a constitutional right.

""And that's something I'm embarrassed to say I took for granted until they pulled my friend Stephen off the air and tried to coerce the affiliates who run our show in the cities that you live in to take my show off the air,"" Kimmel said.

""That's not legal. That's not American. That is un-American, and it is so dangerous,"" he said. ""I want you to think about this. Should the government be allowed to regulate which podcasts the cellphone companies and WiFi providers are allowed to let you download to make sure they serve the public interest? You think that sounds crazy?""

In Kimmel's monologue, he also called Carr an embarrassment and said the FCC head's statements about his show were ""a direct violation of the First Amendment.""

It's safe to say that late-night isn't done talking. And with the battle lines drawn, it's unclear how Disney and other networks with vocal hosts plan to navigate this ongoing dogfight.

Trump has sounded a warning. Before Tuesday night's shows aired, he wondered on Truth Social whether he could reap another multimillion-dollar bounty by suing ABC.

""I think we're going to test ABC out on this,"" Trump wrote. ""Let's see how we do.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Cloudflare goes after Google's AI Overviews with a new license for 20% of the web","https://www.businessinsider.com/cloudflare-google-ai-overviews-license-bots-scraping-content-2025-9","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Cloudflare unveiled a new policy framework designed to give website owners, publishers, and content creators greater control over how AI systems access and use their content.

The policy, called the Content Signals Policy, creates a potentially powerful new license for the web that targets Google's AI-powered search offerings, in particular.

The web is making a pivotal shift from traditional search engines to AI-powered answer engines that create responses directly from scraped content, often without linking back to original sources. This threatens the web's original traffic-driven model, which rewards content creation with clicks, views, and revenue.

Most AI companies, including OpenAI, have separate web crawling bots for search services and AI offerings. In contrast, Google's main search bot collects data from websites to feed both traditional search results and new AI-powered answer engines, including AI Overviews.

Cloudflare's new bot policy and license target Google's data-scraping advantage and seek to even the playing field, said CEO Matthew Prince.

""Every AI answer engine should have to play by the same rules,"" he told Business Insider. ""Google combines its crawler for search with its AI answer engines, which gives them a unique and unfair advantage. We are making clear that there are now different rules for search and AI answer engines.""

The Content Signals Policy, announced on Wednesday, builds on the company's existing web crawling bot management service, with new signals specifically aimed at AI crawlers and data scrapers.

Websites use a standard called robots.txt to control how bots access their data. This system was established at the dawn of the web. Now, the boom in AI bot scraping is putting pressure on it. Essentially, it's a gentlemen's agreement, and some AI companies ignore these website preferences and still crawl sites for data because their thirst for it is so strong.

More than 3.8 million domains already use Cloudflare's robots.txt service. Cloudflare is introducing what is essentially a new license for websites to help them explicitly block or allow AI bot crawlers in nuanced and more powerful ways.

Prince said this license could carry legal weight, especially for Google.

""Google's legal team will see this for what it is — a contract with legal ramifications if they ignore it,"" Prince said.

Prince added that Cloudflare helps run about 20% of the web, so this new license will be applied automatically to millions of websites on Wednesday.

That sets up a choice for Google, Prince said. The tech giant can either stop crawling these sites for its search engine, which would mean missing out on a large chunk of web content. Or, Google could comply and separate its bot crawlers, having one for traditional search and one for AI answer engines, Prince said.

Cloudflare specifically mentioned Google's AI Overviews in its announcement on Wednesday, saying these new settings will let websites block bots that collect data for AI Overviews and ""inference,"" or how AI models draw conclusions and create outputs from data.

""The internet cannot wait for a solution while in the meantime, creators' original content is used for profit by other companies,"" Prince said.

Google has said that its new AI-powered search features still send traffic to websites and may even send higher-quality traffic. The company's executives have also stressed that they care deeply about the health and vibrancy of the web.

Prince said that OpenAI is being more responsible here by separating out its crawling bots, having one for its core AI operations and another for search functions.

Cloudflare's new tool allows creators to clearly express preferences about how their content may be used, choosing either ""Yes"" content can be used or ""No"" content should not be used.

More importantly, the policy distinguishes between different AI-related uses, including search, AI input, and AI training, and it reminds crawlers that robots.txt declarations can carry ""legal significance.""

A search preference would tell bot crawlers that a site's content can only be scraped for use in traditional search engines that send users to the original source of the information.

The AI input preference covers increasingly common situations where AI chatbots and AI models roam the web and collect website data for immediate summarization and inclusion in AI outputs.

The third preference, AI training, would allow websites to block AI bots that scrape data for use in the initial pre-training process, in which AI models are trained to understand the world in broad and powerful ways.

""To ensure the web remains open and thriving, we're giving website owners a better way to express how companies are allowed to use their content,"" Prince said. ""Robots.txt is an underutilized resource that we can help strengthen and make it clear to AI companies that they can no longer ignore a content creator's preferences.""

Honda is the latest automaker to roll back plans for an electric vehicle, citing ""market conditions.""

The company is ending its US production of the Acura ZDX electric crossover that General Motors was producing at a plant in Tennessee, spokespeople for both brands confirmed to Business Insider. The vehicle was only sold in the U.S. and Canada.

A spokesperson for Honda said in an emailed statement that the decision was made ""to better align our product portfolio with the needs of our customers and market conditions.""

""ZDX has played a valuable role for the Acura brand, and will provide a foundation we will build on next year with the arrival of the all-electric Acura RSX, which will be produced at the EV Hub in Ohio in the second half of 2026, as well as with hybrid-electric Acura models now in development,"" the statement continued. CNBC first reported the news.

Honda has sold more than 19,000 ZDXs in North America since the vehicle launched in May of 2024, the spokesperson said. In May of this year, Honda's CEO said the company would cut its EV investment by 30% through the 2031 fiscal year, partly due to ""a slowdown in EV market expansion.""

Compared to the rest of the world, EV sales in North America are slumping — in the first four months of this year, sales rose just 5%, compared to 25% in Europe and 35% in China, per data from EV research firm Rho Motion.

A $7,500 tax credit for buying an EV in the US ends on September 30 as part of President Donald Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill."" Despite a more general slowdown, EV sales surged in August as people raced to take advantage of the credit.

Other automakers have also rolled back plans for EVs in recent years and focused more on internal combustion engines, which power gasoline vehicles. Hertz, for example, paused plans to buy 65,000 EVs last year. Ford canceled plans for electric three-row SUVs, though it recently announced plans for an EV truck.

Just days ago, the CEO of luxury carmaker Bentley said that it will continue to invest in combustion engines, after previously saying it wanted to build only electric vehicles by 2035. He cited a ""dip in demand for luxury electric vehicles.""

Two detainees at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas were killed, and another was in critical condition after a gunman opened fire there on Wednesday morning, the Department of Homeland Security said.

The gunman was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after firing ""indiscriminately"" at the ICE field office building from a nearby rooftop, DHS said. No ICE officers were hurt in the attack.

The suspect was identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, who has lived in Texas and Oklahoma, senior law enforcement officials told NBC News.

FBI Director Kash Patel said an ""initial review of the evidence shows an [ideological] motive behind this attack.""

""One of the unspent shell casings recovered was engraved with the phrase 'ANTI ICE,"" Patel wrote in a post on X, which included a photo of the casings.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said, ""This vile attack was motivated by hatred for ICE."" 

Noem and other top Trump administration officials quickly linked the attack to what they characterized as extreme left-wing rhetoric against ICE. 

The agency has become a flashpoint of controversy in President Donald Trump's second term as it carries out unprecedented operations to remove millions of undocumented immigrants from the United States.

Jahn was registered to vote as an independent, according to NBC, citing officials.

""This shooting must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences,"" Noem said.

Vice President JD Vance, in a post on X, said, ""The obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.""

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, in her own tweet, said, ""Democrats must stop demonizing the heroic men and women of ICE who are just doing their jobs to keep Americans safe.""

Joe Rothrock, special agent in charge of the FBI's Dallas field office, said the shooting was only the latest example of violence targeting ICE in Texas.

Rothrock noted that there was a ""coordinated attack"" on an immigrant detention center in the city of Alvarado on July 4.

In that incident, 10 were charged with attempted murder of a federal officer and discharging a firearm during and in relation to a violent crime.

A federal criminal complaint says that the group shot fireworks toward the center and vandalized vehicles and the facility. 

An Alvarado police officer police officer who responded to the disturbance was shot in the neck by one of the people in the crowd, and another person shot multiple rounds at correctional officers, the complaint alleged.

At Wednesday's conference, Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson thanked law enforcement who responded to the shooting, and called for people to come together in prayer for the nation.

""There's a lot going on right now in our country, a lot that's confusing,"" Johnson said.

""Please pray for everyone who's affected by today's tragedy.""

Johnson called for patience from the public while the investigation into the shooting continues.

Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee in the race for mayor of New York City, said Wednesday that he has received at least seven calls from ""emissaries"" of wealthy people who have repeatedly offered him money to end his campaign.

Sliwa slammed those offers as ""unethical and illegal.""

And he warned that if he receives one more such offer, he will begin revealing names of the wealthy New Yorkers who have made them, NBC affiliate WNBC reported.

Sliwa reiterated his vow not to suspend his campaign. 

""Cross my heart and hope to die,"" the Guardian Angels founder told WNBC when asked if he plans to stay in the race until Election Day, Nov. 4.

President Donald Trump has suggested that Sliwa and Mayor Eric Adams drop out of the race to clear the way for a one-on-one match-up between former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the Democratic nominee, Zohran Mamdani.

""I would say that Cuomo might have a chance of winning if it was a one-on-one,"" said Trump, who has called Mamdani a ""communist.""

Mamdani is a self-described democratic socialist.

Adams and Cuomo are both Democrats, but are running as independents.

Recent polls show Mamdani comfortably leading Cuomo, with Adams and Sliwa trailing by a wide margin.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that cooling in the labor market prompted the central bank to cut interest rates last week. Speaking to business leaders in Rhode Island yesterday, he warned that there's a ""challenging situation"" ahead as the Fed tries to balance its goals of high employment and tame inflation.

Here's what to know:

Everything's bigger in Texas. Just take a look at two of the most recent corporate infrastructure investments.

OpenAI's flagship site for the $500 billion Stargate program opened in Abilene, a city about 180 miles west of Dallas. It's only one of OpenAI's recent buildout announcements, which total about $850 billion in spending, CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos reports. 

CEO Sam Altman rejected the notion that his company's spending spree is concerning: ""People are worried. I totally get that. I think that's a very natural thing,"" Altman told CNBC. ""This is what it takes to deliver AI,"" he said.

Elsewhere in the Lone Star state, Eli Lilly announced plans for a $6.5 billion manufacturing facility in Houston. The center will boost the company's production capability for drugs including its closely watched experimental obesity pill, orforglipron.

Micron beat Wall Street's expectations for its fourth fiscal quarter yesterday. The company said revenue surged 46% year over year, thanks largely to demand for its memory and storage products tied to the artificial intelligence boom.

Despite Micron's upbeat report and guidance, its stock rose less than 1% in extended trading. As CNBC's Kif Leswing points out, the muted reaction may be explained by the stock's big run already: Shares have nearly doubled in 2025.

President Donald Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee is leaving startups in a tough spot.

Companies are used to paying between $2,000 and $5,000 per visa application. Experts are warning that a jump to $100,000 will particularly hamper the ability of smaller technology companies with less revenue than Big Tech firms to bring top talent to the U.S.

Exequiel Hernandez — an associate professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania — said the change will be a ""disaster"" for America, though he added that large companies will likely find workarounds, like moving jobs offshore. Meanwhile, Y Combinator's Garry Tan equated the fee to ""$100K toll booths,"" writing on social media that ""it kneecaps startups.""

Feeling grim about the economy, young investors are shelving traditional trading mechanisms in favor of risky bets. Call it ""financial nihilism.""

The phenomenon can help explain the prominence of meme stocks, crypto and leveraged funds, as well as prediction markets and sports betting platforms. As young people see economic goals like home ownership falling increasingly out of reach, CNBC found that in some cases, they're putting short-term luck above long-term strategy.

Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show returned to air last night after a nearly weeklong a pause following the comedian's comments about Charlie Kirk's killing. CNBC has all the details of his first show back.

Oops, something went wrong

Another crypto treasury company is betting on stock buybacks to appease investors, with Thumzup Media Corporation—which is currently stockpiling Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE)—the latest to see its share price climb after revealing such plans.

Thumzup, which trades as TZUP on the Nasdaq, announced its board has approved a $10 million share repurchase program running through the end of 2026. This follows the recent completion of an initial $1 million buyback program this month, as the company repurchased 212,432 shares at a weighted average price of $4.71 per share.

TZUP was recently trading for $4.82 per share, up about 6% on the day. It rose as high as $5.30 earlier in the session. Thumzup stock is down about 20% over the last month, continuing a decline after peaking at $16.49 in early August.

""Our decision to implement a $10 million share repurchase program reflects confidence in Thumzup's long-term strategy and our commitment to delivering value to shareholders,"" said Thumzup CEO Robert Steele, in a statement. ""We believe our balanced approach, combining strategic accumulation of digital assets with investment in its underlying infrastructure, positions us well for sustained growth.""

Thumzup said Wednesday that it holds approximately 19.1 BTC ($2.17 million) and 7.5 million DOGE ($1.83 million). The firm's board has also authorized purchases of Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Litecoin, and USDC stablecoin for its treasury.

DeFi Development Corp. Stock Rises as Solana Firm Boosts Buyback Plan to $100 Million

The social media marketing tech company has also signed a definitive agreement to acquire DogeHash Technologies, a Dogecoin mining operation with 2,500 active rigs and 1,000 additional rigs scheduled for delivery. This acquisition, subject to shareholder approval and closing conditions, would expand Thumzup's cryptocurrency mining capabilities.

Other crypto treasury companies recently instituting stock buyback schemes include Ethereum-focused firms SharpLink Gaming and ETHZilla, along with Solana treasury company DeFi Development Corporation—the last of which revealed plans on Wednesday to repurchase up to $100 million worth of shares.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum's rollup networks are mispricing small transactions, creating risks that range from inflated user costs to denial-of-service attacks, according to a new study by researchers at zkSecurity, Prooflab, and Imperial College London.

The study, “Unaligned Incentives: Pricing Attacks Against Blockchain Rollups,” was posted on Sunday and detailed how different rollups calculate fees for execution, data availability, and proof costs. It concluded that current fee mechanisms are too simple to balance fairness, security, and usability.

Rollups are layer-2 networks that batch transactions and settle them on layer-1 blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana to reduce costs and increase capacity. Rollups are central to Ethereum's scaling roadmap, which relies on these systems to handle high volumes of transactions while the base chain remains limited in throughput.

To operate, rollups must pay for three distinct resources. The first is computation, the cost of executing the transactions inside a batch. The second is data availability, the expense of posting transaction data back to a blockchain so it can be verified. The third is the gas cost for batch settlement and proof verification.

Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Says L2 Base Is ‘Doing Things the Right Way'

These three costs vary independently, but the study finds that most rollups do not account for them separately. Instead, they often collapse them into a single formula or apply fixed rules, which can distort prices.

According to the researchers, this design means small transfers may be mispriced. Users making low-value payments can end up paying more than necessary, while attackers can take advantage of underpriced transactions to send large volumes of spam at little cost.

The authors benchmarked five major rollups—Polygon zkEVM, zkSync Era, Scroll, Optimism, and Arbitrum—and found wide differences in how fees are set. Some networks fix charges at the time a transaction is submitted, others wait until a batch is sealed, and some issue refunds if the actual cost ends up lower than expected.

Those mechanisms may appear technical, but they create opportunities for exploitation. For example, a refund system can be gamed by attackers who submit large numbers of transactions, then reclaim part of the fee while still consuming network resources.

 

Beyond user frustration, the paper argues, these weaknesses create systemic risk. If mispricing allows attackers to subsidize small transactions, then they can mount denial-of-service attacks that clog the network, degrade performance, or raise costs for honest users. The problem lies not in faulty code, but in economic design choices that shape incentives.

The study stresses that these issues matter as Ethereum's rollup ecosystem grows. Rollups today secure tens of billions of dollars in assets, making them high-value targets.

As mitigation, the paper calls for “multidimensional” fee mechanisms that separately price computation, data posting, and proving. Aligning fees with actual resource use, it argues, would make systems more resistant to spam while giving users more predictable costs.

Ethereum Devs Set December Date for Fusaka Upgrade

Tools such as dynamic adjustment, partial batching, and disclosure of cost components could all help address the issue. Some rollup teams are already experimenting with adaptive fee curves and real-time modeling, but the study notes that standards are not yet established.

The findings come as Ethereum advances a roadmap built around zero-knowledge proofs and rollup-centric scaling. Zero-knowledge virtual machines, or zkVMs, promise stronger verification of transactions, but they also introduce proving costs that can spike depending on demand and available hardware. Models that do not account for that variability, the paper says, risk breaking down under stress.

For users, exchanges, and wallets, that can mean inconsistent fees and degraded service. For developers and investors, the study's message is to look beyond headline throughput or nominally low fees and examine how those fees are calculated.

""What"": a simple reply by crypto influencer Gainzy pretty much summed up the sentiment when the notorious convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, or SBF, seemingly posted on social media after a long hiatus (and despite being in jail). 

To make matters worse, the token linked to defunct crypto exchange FTX surged nearly 24% in the last 24 hours, after his X account posted a simple ""gm"" on Tuesday. 

gm

This simple post seems to have been taken as an opportunity by speculative crypto traders to pump the FTT token, which now has no value associated with it, nearly 50%-60% within minutes, reaching a peak of around $1.20-$1.23. Despite his incarceration and clarification that the post was made by a ""friend"" on his behalf, the token is still up 25%, trading around $1.014, according to CoinDesk data. 

The FTT token has also seen a sharp increase in activity and trading volumes following the post, according to data compiled by The Tie. 

The number of active addresses reached 201, significantly outpacing the monthly average of 56, The Tie said. Additionally, centralized exchange deposits doubled, reaching 13, while withdrawals quadrupled to 38 compared to the monthly average, it added. 

The crypto community on X reacted swiftly with anger, skepticism and humor to SBF's post. 

One of the most scathing replies came from on-chain investigator ZachXBT. In a now-deleted post, he condemned SBF, stating that he “deserves zero human rights” due to the harm caused by FTX's collapse. His view reflects a segment of the community's lingering resentment towards FTX's collapse, which hurt investors who are still waiting for some of their funds from its bankruptcy estate and the broader crypto community.

Other community members, including Laura Shin, mocked SBF's sudden social media activity, saying, ""That's so 2021."" 

Meanwhile, Arthur Hayes, the BitMEX co-founder who now runs crypto venture fund Maelstrom, took a humorous jab, replying “Wen memecoin?” — a likely playful reference to the speculative, meme-driven nature of the surge in FTT token after SBF's unexpected post. This potentially underscores a view that the price movement was more about market psychology than substance.

The surge in FTT token — once a key utility token for trading fee discounts and staking benefits on the FTX exchange — has been largely dormant since the platform's spectacular implosion that ushered in a brutal crypto winter that devastated many investors. 

However, strangely enough, this is not the first time this has happened. The same thing unfolded in February of last year, when the SBF's account posted on X for the first time in two years. At the time, he was detained in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, and his lawyers were working through an appeal of his conviction (the appeal is ongoing, with arguments currently scheduled for November 2025). 

The new social media post also came as the FTX estate continues to work to repay creditors. 

The FTX Recovery Trust is set to release $1.6 billion to creditors at the end of this month, marking the third major payout since the crypto exchange's implosion nearly three years ago.

This recent activity, though potentially short-lived, shows the token still reacts sharply to headlines and sentiments — especially those tied to its controversial founder.

As a wound heals, it goes through several stages: clotting to stop bleeding, immune system response, scabbing, and scarring.

A wearable device called ""a-Heal,"" designed by engineers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, aims to optimize each stage of the process. The system uses a tiny camera and AI to detect the stage of healing and deliver a treatment in the form of medication or an electric field. The system responds to the unique healing process of the patient, offering personalized treatment.

The portable, wireless device could make wound therapy more accessible to patients in remote areas or with limited mobility. Initial preclinical results, published in the journal npj Biomedical Innovations, show the device successfully speeds up the healing process.

Designing a-Heal 

A team of UC Santa Cruz and UC Davis researchers, sponsored by the DARPA-BETR program and led by UC Santa Cruz Baskin Engineering Endowed Chair and Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Marco Rolandi, designed a device that combines a camera, bioelectronics, and AI for faster wound healing. The integration in one device makes it a ""closed-loop system"" -- one of the firsts of its kind for wound healing as far as the researchers are aware.

""Our system takes all the cues from the body, and with external interventions, it optimizes the healing progress,"" Rolandi said.

The device uses an onboard camera, developed by fellow Associate Professor of ECE Mircea Teodorescu and described in a Communications Biology study, to take photos of the wound every two hours. The photos are fed into a machine learning (ML) model, developed by Associate Professor of Applied Mathematics Marcella Gomez, which the researchers call the ""AI physician"" running on a nearby computer.

""It's essentially a microscope in a bandage,"" Teodorescu said. ""Individual images say little, but over time, continuous imaging lets AI spot trends, wound healing stages, flag issues, and suggest treatments.""

The AI physician uses the image to diagnose the wound stage and compares that to where the wound should be along a timeline of optimal wound healing. If the image reveals a lag, the ML model applies a treatment: either medicine, delivered via bioelectronics; or an electric field, which can enhance cell migration toward wound closure.

The treatment topically delivered through the device is fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor which controls serotonin levels in the wound and improves healing by decreasing inflammation and increasing wound tissue closure. The dose, determined by preclinical studies by the Isseroff group at UC Davis group to optimize healing, is administered by bioelectronic actuators on the device, developed by Rolandi. An electric field, optimized to improve healing and developed by prior work of the UC Davis' Min Zhao and Roslyn Rivkah Isseroff, is also delivered through the device.

The AI physician determines the optimal dosage of medication to deliver and the magnitude of the applied electric field. After the therapy has been applied for a certain period of time, the camera takes another image, and the process starts again.

While in use, the device transmits images and data such as healing rate to a secure web interface, so a human physician can intervene manually and fine-tune treatment as needed. The device attaches directly to a commercially available bandage for convenient and secure use.

To assess the potential for clinical use, the UC Davis team tested the device in preclinical wound models. In these studies, wounds treated with a-Heal followed a healing trajectory about 25% faster than standard of care. These findings highlight the promise of the technology not only for accelerating closure of acute wounds, but also for jump-starting stalled healing in chronic wounds.

AI reinforcement

The AI model used for this system, which was led by Assistant Professor of Applied Mathematics Marcella Gomez, uses a reinforcement learning approach, described in a study in the journal Bioengineering, to mimic the diagnostic approach used by physicians.

Reinforcement learning is a technique in which a model is designed to fulfill a specific end goal, learning through trial and error how to best achieve that goal. In this context, the model is given a goal of minimizing time to wound closure, and is rewarded for making progress toward that goal. It continually learns from the patient and adapts its treatment approach.

The reinforcement learning model is guided by an algorithm that Gomez and her students created called Deep Mapper, described in a preprint study, which processes wound images to quantify the stage of healing in comparison to normal progression, mapping it along the trajectory of healing. As time passes with the device on a wound, it learns a linear dynamic model of the past healing and uses that to forecast how the healing will continue to progress.

""It's not enough to just have the image, you need to process that and put it into context. Then, you can apply the feedback control,"" Gomez said.

This technique makes it possible for the algorithm to learn in real-time the impact of the drug or electric field on healing, and guides the reinforcement learning model's iterative decision making on how to adjust the drug concentration or electric-field strength.

Now, the research team is exploring the potential for this device to improve healing of chronic and infected wounds.

Elucidating the complex network of communication between tumour cells is central to understanding cell fate decisions and progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)1,2. We previously showed that constant suppression of BMP activity by the BMP antagonist GREM1 secreted by mesenchymal PDAC cells is essential for maintaining the fate of epithelial PDAC cells3. Here we identify SPP1 (also known as osteopontin)4 as a key regulator of mesenchymal cell fate in pancreatic cancer. Proteomic analysis of plasma from patients with PDAC showed that SPP1 is substantially upregulated in late-stage disease. Inactivation of Spp1 led to a delay in tumorigenesis in mouse PDAC models and abolished metastasis formation. Spp1 was expressed in epithelial PDAC cells, and Spp1 inactivation resulted in a conversion of mesenchymal to epithelial PDAC cells. Mechanistically, SPP1 bound the CD61 receptor on mesenchymal PDAC cells to induce Bmp2 and Grem1 expression, and GREM1 inhibition of BMP signalling was required for Spp1 expression in epithelial cells, thereby forming an intercellular regulatory loop. Concomitant inactivation of Grem1 reverted the epithelial phenotype of Spp1 knockout to fully mesenchymal PDAC. Conversely, Grem1 heterozygosity combined with Spp1 knockout resulted in wild-type PDAC histology, a result that confirmed the direct antagonistic functions of these factors. Hence, mesenchymal and epithelial PDAC cell fates are determined by the reciprocal paracrine regulation of the soluble factors GREM1 and SPP1.

PDAC is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with a 5-year relative survival rate of only 13%5. To identify factors that control the progression of pancreatic cancer, we compared protein levels in the plasma of patients with early-stage (stage I or II) or late-stage (stage III or IV) PDAC (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). The abundance of SPP1 was significantly increased at late stages (Fig. 1b). SPP1 plasma levels were also increased in Pdx1-cre;KrasLSL-G12D/+;Trp53fl/fl;Rosa26LSL-YFP (KPCY) mice, a commonly used mouse model of PDAC6, compared with wild-type (WT) animals (Fig. 1c).

Source Data

To explore the role of SPP1 in the development and progression of pancreatic cancer, we first analysed single-cell sequencing data from public databases. Cancer cell populations with high SPP1 expression had significantly higher levels of genes involved in the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature7,8 than populations with low SPP1 expression (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c). Moreover, by analysing publicly available transcriptome data of 644 patients with pancreatic cancer, we observed that patients with high SPP1 expression exhibited significant enrichment of the hallmark EMT gene set8. Accordingly, these patients showed worse prognosis compared with those with low SPP1 expression (Extended Data Fig. 1d–f). Together, these results suggest that SPP1 is a regulator of EMT in pancreatic cancer.

Immunofluorescence staining of KPCY tumours revealed that SPP1 was predominantly expressed in epithelial PDAC cells (EPCs) and not in vimentin (VIM)-positive mesenchymal PDAC cells (MPCs) (Fig. 1d). To understand SPP1 function, we established organoids from tumours of Pdx1-Flp;KrasFSF-G12D/+;Trp53frt/frt;Vim-GFP (KPFV) mice9, which enabled the differentiation between EPCs and MPCs on the basis of GFP fluorescence (Extended Data Fig. 1g). We performed Spp1 knockout in KPFV organoids using CRISPR–Cas9 technology (Extended Data Fig. 1h). The VIM–GFP+ MPC population was abolished after Spp1 knockout (Fig. 1e), which suggested that Spp1 is required for MPC fate. Quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT–qPCR) analysis showed a marked decrease in expression of the mesenchymal markers Vim, Fn1 and S100a4, concomitant with a notable increase in the epithelial markers Krt19, Cdh1 and Epcam10 (Fig. 1f). In line with this result, there were fewer allograft tumours generated from Pdx1-Flp;KrasFSF-G12D/+;Trp53frt/frt (KPF) organoids deficient in SPP1 (Spp1Δ/Δ KPF), and the tumours were small and consisted almost exclusively of EPCs. By contrast, tumours formed from control KPF organoids contained both EPC and MPC populations (Fig. 1g,h and Extended Data Fig. 1i,j). Furthermore, Spp1 overexpression in organoids from LSL-KrasG12D/+;LSL-Trp53R172H/+;Pdx-1-Cre (KPR172H/+C) mice induced mesenchymal differentiation of PDAC cells (Extended Data Fig. 2a–d). Notably, these phenotypes were also observed in human PDAC organoids and xenografts with SPP1 knocked out or overexpressed (Extended Data Fig. 3a–o). Thus, SPP1 produced by EPCs is required for the maintenance of MPCs in both mouse and human PDAC.

Several receptors have been identified as receptors for SPP1, including the integrin CD61 (encoded by Itgb3)11,12,13. Immunofluorescence staining of KPCY tumours showed a markedly complementary expression pattern of SPP1 and CD61, and CD61 was predominantly expressed in MPCs (Fig. 2a). To further investigate the relationship between SPP1 and CD61, we performed CRISPR–Cas9-mediated knockout of Itgb3 in KPFV organoids (Extended Data Fig. 4a). VIM–GFP+ cells were not observed in Itgb3-deficient KPFV organoids, which also had a significant reduction in mesenchymal marker expression (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 4b). Furthermore, allograft formation was significantly reduced (Fig. 2d,e), and the proportion of MPCs was decreased in Itgb3-deficient allografts (Fig. 2f,g). Thus, Itgb3 knockout phenocopies Spp1 knockout (Fig. 1e–g), a result that strongly suggests that SPP1 functions through CD61.

We next investigated the potential function of SPP1 in PDAC progression. We combined PDAC induced by the Flp/Frt recombination system (KPF mice)14 with a floxed Spp1 (Spp1fl) allele, a Flp-inducible Rosa26FSF-creER allele14 that allows Spp1 deletion in the pancreatic parenchyma during tumour development and a Tomato/GFP-Cre reporter allele15 to generate compound Pdx1-Flp;KrasFSF-G12D/+;Trp53frt/frt;R26FSF-creER;R26mTmG;Spp1fl/fl (Spp1fl/fl KPFCT) mice (Fig. 3a).

Tamoxifen was administered to 25-day-old animals to inactivate Spp1 in PDAC tumours. Histology of Spp1-deficent tumours showed a notable increase in epithelial structures (Fig. 3b), and immunofluorescence analysis revealed that PDAC tumours contained a marked increase in EPCs (KRT19+VIM–) and a substantial decrease in MPCs (KRT19–VIM+) compared with control KPFCT tumours (Fig. 3c,d). Notably, Spp1fl/fl KPFCT tumours exhibited a considerable reduction in cancer-associated fibroblasts (Extended Data Fig. 4c–f). However, despite the reduction in cancer-associated fibroblasts, the degree of immune infiltration was unchanged (Extended Data Fig. 4g–n). An increase in MPCs is known as a crucial factor that leads to poor prognosis in patients with PDAC16,17. Accordingly, Spp1fl/fl KPFCT mice with tumours exhibited significantly increased survival compared with control KPFCT mice (Fig. 3e). Moreover, the absence of Spp1 also substantially reduced PDAC development in the KPCY model, with a substantial percentage of Spp1-deficient animals surviving more than 400 days (Fig. 3f).

EMT is as an important mechanism of tumour metastasis formation18. To investigate the impact of Spp1 on PDAC metastasis, we used (Pdx1-Flp;KrasFSF-G12D/+;Trp53WT/frt;R26FSF-creER;R26mTmG) KPhetFCT mice, because the heterozygosity of Trp53 means that there is a longer latency period in the formation of the tumour, which enables metastases to form and disseminate3. Ultrasound imaging showed that most mice developed tumours at around 100 days of age. Therefore, tamoxifen was administered at this point, and tumour progression and metastasis formation were monitored (Fig. 3g). Consistent with Spp1fl/fl KPFCT mice, Spp1fl/fl KPhetFCT mice (which have Spp1 knocked out) had tumours that predominantly comprised EPCs, whereas KPhetFCT mice (with WT Spp1) formed tumours with both EPCs and MPCs (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). In KPhetFCT mice, liver metastases were detected in 23% of animals and 30% had lung metastases. By contrast, Spp1fl/fl KPhetFCT mice had no metastases in the liver or lung (Fig. 3g–i and Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). Furthermore, orthotopic transplantation of Spp1-overexpressing KPR172H/+C organoids significantly promoted liver and lung metastases (Extended Data Fig. 6a–f). By contrast, in vivo administration of a SPP1-blocking antibody reduced MPC cell fate and suppressed liver and lung metastases (Extended Data Fig. 7a–j). Taken together, these data demonstrate that SPP1 is essential for maintaining the fate of MPCs and promoting metastasis formation.

We next sought to investigate the molecular mechanism of SPP1 function. We previously identified Grem1 as a BMP2 target gene to control epithelial cell identity3. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of Spp1Δ/Δ KPFV and control organoids revealed that SPP1 function is required for Bmp2 and Grem1 expression (Fig. 4a), a result that was confirmed by RT–qPCR (Fig. 4b). Similarly, Itgb3 knockout significantly attenuated Bmp2 and Grem1 expression (Fig. 4c). Conversely, overexpressing Itgb3 increased Bmp2 and Grem1 expression (Extended Data Fig. 8a). This result suggests that the signalling axis SPP1–CD61–BMP2–GREM1 operates between EPC and MPC PDAC subpopulations.

RNA-seq analysis revealed that Itgb3 knockout organoids showed impaired NF-κB signalling (Extended Data Fig. 8b). RT–qPCR confirmed downregulation of the NF-κB target genes Ccl2 (ref. 19), Clap2 (ref. 20) and Tnf19, whereas their expression increased when Itgb3 was overexpressed (Extended Data Fig. 8c,d). Next, using the JASPAR database21, we identified two putative NF-κB-binding sites in the Bmp2 promoter, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays for RelA confirmed binding to these two sites in the Bmp2 promoter (Extended Data Fig. 8e,f). The TAK1 kinase inhibitor 5Z-7-oxozeaenol22 significantly inhibited the binding of RelA to the site at +1597 and reduced Bmp2 mRNA levels (Extended Data Fig. 8g,h). Thus, SPP1 induces Bmp2 expression, and indirectly the expression of the BMP2 target gene Grem1, by activating the NF-κB signalling pathway.

BMP2 treatment increased Bmp2 expression, which indicated the presence of an autoregulatory feedback loop23,24, and also upregulated Grem1 but decreased Spp1 expression (Fig. 4d). BMP2 treatment led to a rapid induction of the BMP target genes Id1, Id2 and Id3, but Spp1 downregulation occurred only after 24 h and coincided with an increase in Vim expression. By contrast, treatment with the BMP inhibitor LDN193189 led to the opposite effect (Extended Data Fig. 8i–k), which indicated that Spp1 is expressed as a consequence of epithelial identity. Thus, BMP2, SPP1 and GREM1 are components of a complex regulatory loop that determines PDAC cell fate.

To better understand the mechanism of PDAC cell fate determination, we generated Spp1 and Grem1 compound double-knockout models (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). Concomitant inactivation of Grem1 reverted the epithelial phenotype of Spp1 knockout to fully mesenchymal PDAC. Moreover, Grem1 heterozygosity combined with Spp1 knockout resulted in WT PDAC histology (Fig. 4e,f and Extended Data Fig. 9c), a result that highlighted their directly opposing functions. Furthermore, subsequent Grem1 knockout reversed the effect of Spp1 knockout and produced a mesenchymal phenotype. Conversely, Grem1 overexpression reversed the effects of Spp1 overexpression and induced an epithelia phenotype (Extended Data Figs. 10a–h and 11a–h). These results further emphasize the antagonistic relationship between SPP1 and GREM1.

Cellular heterogeneity is a prominent feature used for the classification of pancreatic cancer25,26,27. We showed here that epithelial and mesenchymal PDAC subpopulations are required for the maintenance of each other through a reciprocal, paracrine signalling network of three diffusible molecules: SPP1, BMP2 and GREM1 (Extended Data Fig. 12). We speculate that the mutual dependency of epithelial and mesenchymal subpopulations may underlie the obligatory cellular heterogeneity seen in PDAC. Moreover, our data suggested that cellular heterogeneity is required for efficient pancreatic tumour formation, as decreasing the mesenchymal PDAC subpopulation through Spp1 inactivation led to a substantial extension of lifespan in the aggressive KPF and KPC PDAC models (Fig. 3e,f). Hence therapeutic strategies that aim to reduce cellular heterogeneity could be considered for PDAC treatment.

Peripheral venous blood samples were collected from 26 patients with pancreatic cancer at the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. Plasma was isolated from the collected blood samples, and plasma proteomic analysis was subsequently performed. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and approvals were secured from the ethics board of the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University for the use of these specimens in research. All clinical samples were collected with informed consent, and all experiments adhered to the regulations and approvals of the internal review and ethics board at the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. The Institutional Review Board approval number is KY-2024-249-01. Clinical information on the patients, including age, sex, TNM stage, histology and differentiation, was obtained from medical and follow-up records (Supplementary Table 1).

Human pancreatic tissue samples were obtained from patients at the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University who underwent surgery for pancreatic neoplasia. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and approvals were secured from the ethics board of the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University for the use of these specimens in research. The tissue samples were collected in Advanced DMEM/F12 base medium with 100 µg ml–1 Primocin and minced into 1 mm2 pieces with a scissor. Minced tissue was then washed in the base medium and resuspended in 10 ml digestion medium containing Advanced DMEM/F12, 5 mg ml–1 collagenase XI, 2 mg ml–1 dispase II and 10 µg ml–1 DNase I. Tumour fragments were digested for 2–4 h on a Thermo Scientific tube rotator at 37 °C at speed 25. Digestion was stopped by adding the base medium. Tissue was then washed and centrifuged twice with the base medium and digested for 10 min with TrypLE Express (Gibco) supplemented with Y-27632 (10 µM). Tissue was then filtered through a 100 µm cell filter (Falcon), washed and centrifuged twice in the base medium. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml red cell lysis buffer (Corning) for 5 min. Cells were then washed and centrifuged a further 2 times in the base medium, resuspended in 50 µl Matrigel per well (Corning) and plated onto pre-warmed 24-well plates. Next, 500 µl medium per well was added 15–30 min later once the Matrigel had solidified. The medium contained 1× B27 supplement, 10 mM nicotinamide, 1.25mM N-acetylcysteine, 10 nM gastrin, 100 ng ml–1 human FGF10, 100 ng ml–1 mouse Noggin, 500 nM A83-01, 100 µg ml–1 Primocin, 50 ng ml–1 EGF, 10 µM Y-27632, 10% (v/v) R-Spondin 1 conditioned medium and 50% (v/v) WNT3A conditioned medium.

For protein extraction, cellular debris from the plasma samples was removed through centrifugation at 12,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then carefully transferred to a fresh centrifuge tube, and the protein was quantified using a BCA kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

For trypsin digestion, high-abundant proteins were first removed from the plasma samples using a kit (A36369, Thermo), and the solution was then treated with 5 mM dithiothreitol for 30 min at 56 °C, followed by alkylation with 11 mM iodoacetamide for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Next, 70 μl enzyme digestion buffer was added to the beads and incubated at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by allowing the samples to return to room temperature. Trypsin was then added to a final concentration of 20 ng μl–1 for overnight digestion. The resulting peptides were desalted using C18 ZipTips (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then dried for subsequent mass spectrometry (MS) analysis.

For liquid chromatography–MS/MS analysis, the tryptic peptides were resuspended in solvent A and directly loaded onto a self-fabricated reversed-phase analytical column (15 cm in length, 100 μm internal diameter). The mobile phase was composed of solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and solvent B (0.1% formic acid and 80% acetonitrile in water). Peptides were separated using the following gradient: 0–1.6 min, 4–22.5% B; 1.6–2.0 min, 22.5–35% B; 2.0–2.6 min, 35–55% B; 2.6–2.7 min, 55–99% B; 2.7–6.8 min, 99% B; 6.8–7.6 min, 99% B, all at a constant flow rate of 300 nl min–1 on a Vanquish Neo UPLC system (ThermoFisher Scientific).

The separated peptides were analysed using an Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-electrospray ion source. The electrospray voltage was set to 1,900 V. Precursors were analysed in the Orbitrap detector, whereas fragments were analysed in the Astral detector. The full MS scan resolution was set to 240,000 with a scan range of 380–980 m/z. The MS/MS scan was fixed with a first mass of 150.0 m/z at a resolution of 80,000. Higher-energy collisional dissociation fragmentation was performed at a normalized collision energy of 25%. The automatic gain control target was set at 500%, with a maximum injection time of 3 ms.

For database searches, the data-independent acquisition (DIA) data were processed using the DIA-NN search engine (v.1.8). Tandem mass spectra were searched against the Homo_sapiens_9606_SP_20231220.fasta database (20,429 entries) concatenated with a reversed decoy database. Trypsin/P was specified as the cleavage enzyme, allowing up to one missed cleavage. Excision on the amino-terminal Met and carbamidomethylation on Cys were specified as fixed modifications. The false discovery rate (FDR) was adjusted to be less than 1%.

To address missing values in our dataset, we used the K-nearest neighbours imputation method using the KNNImputer function from the scikit-learn library in Python28.

The KrasLSL-G12D (ref. 29), Trp53flox (ref. 30), Trp53R172H (ref. 31), Pdx1-cre (ref. 32), Pdx1-Flp, KRasFSF-G12D, Trp53frt, Rosa26FSF-creER (ref. 14), Rosa26LSL-YFP (ref. 33), Rosa26mT/mG (ref. 15) and Grem1fl (ref. 34) mouse lines have been previously described. The VIM–GFP transgenic line developed by the Gene Expression Nervous System Atlas (GENSAT) Project was obtained from the Mutant Mouse Resource & Research Centers9. Spp1fl mice (NM-CKO-210205) were purchased from the Shanghai Model Organisms Center. These lines were intercrossed to generate the desired genotypes of both sexes on a C57BL/6 background in Charles River Laboratories. Mouse genotypes were determined using real-time PCR with specific probes designed for each gene (Transnetyx).

To activate CreERT recombinase after tumour onset, Pdx1-Flp;KrasFSF-G12D;Trp53frt/frt;Rosa26FSF-creER;Rosa26mT/mG;Spp1fl/fl (Spp1fl/fl KPFCT), Spp1WT/WT KPFCT, Grem1fl/fl KPFCT, Grem1fl/WT KPFCT, Spp1fl/flGrem1fl/WT KPFCT and Spp1fl/fGrem1fl/fl KPFCT mice were given tamoxifen through intraperitoneal injections at a dose of 100 mg kg−1 body weight, once a day for 5 days at 25 days of age. Pdx1-Flp;KrasFSF-G12D;Trp53WT/frt;Rosa26FSF-creER;Rosa26mT/mG;Spp1fl/fl (Spp1fl/fl KPhetFCT) and Spp1WT/WT KPhetFCT mice were given tamoxifen at the same doses at 100 days of age. Sample sizes were determined on the basis of the results of our preliminary experiments. Mice from autochthonous tumour models were selected according to their correct genotypes.

Plasma was isolated from the collected blood samples from mice after humane euthanasia. The samples were centrifugated at 12,000g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was carefully transferred to a fresh centrifuge tube. Protein levels were quantified using a BCA kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. ELISA was performed according to the Mouse & Rat Osteopontin (OPN) ELISA Kit–Quantikine protocol (R&D System). The plasma SPP1 concentration was calculated on the basis of the Mouse/Rat OPN standard.

The immunocompromised Nu/Nu mice used have been previously described35, and adults (aged 8–12 weeks) obtained from Charles River Laboratories were used for transplantation.

Cells dissociated from organoids were subcutaneously injected in 50 μl cold growth-factor-reduced Matrigel (Corning). For Spp1 knockout organoid transplantation, a total 10,000 Spp1Δ/Δ KPF and Spp1WT/WT cells were injected into contralateral flanks of Nu/Nu mice. For Itgb3 knockout organoid transplantation, a total 100,000 Itgb3Δ/Δ KPF and Itgb3WT/WT cells were injected into contralateral flanks of Nu/Nu mice. For the inducible Grem1 deletion after Spp1 deletion analysis, we used CRISPR–Cas9-mediated knockout of Spp1 in GFP-labelled Grem1fl/fl KPFC organoids, and a total 100,000 cells dissociated from GFP-labelled Grem1fl/flSpp1Δ/Δ KPFC organoids were injected into the flanks of Nu/Nu mice. After tumours reached a size of 100 mm3, tamoxifen or peanut oil (vehicle) was intraperitoneally injected at a dose of 100 mg kg−1 body weight once a day for 5 days. For the inducible Grem1 overexpression after Spp1 overexpression analysis, we used Plv-SPP1–GFP and pINDUCER-GREM1 overexpression lentiviral vectors in KPFC organoids, and a total of 100,000 cells dissociated from Plv-SPP1–GFP and pINDUCER-GREM1 KPF organoids were injected into the flanks of Nu/Nu mice. After tumours reached a size of 100 mm3, doxycycline or saline (vehicle) was intraperitoneally injected at a dose of 2 mg kg–1 body weight twice weekly.

Tumour growth was monitored twice a week and mice were humanely euthanized when the tumour size reached a mean diameter of 1.2 cm. The tumours were weighed and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Cellstor) for histological analyses.

All animal experiments were approved by the Institute of Cancer Research, London's Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body and conformed to UK Home Office regulations under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, including Amendment Regulations 2012. The mice were housed in individually ventilated cages at constant temperature and humidity (23 ± 2 °C, 50–60%) in a pathogen-free controlled environment, with a standard 12 h light–12 h dark cycle and unlimited access water and food. For subcutaneous transplantation experiments, the maximum tumour size did not exceed the mean diameter of 1.2 cm, in compliance with project licence PP9490916.

The injection technique was adapted from published literature36,37. Under anaesthesia, mice were placed in a supine position on a heated (37 °C) ultrasound platform. The platform was rotated 180° anticlockwise to position the injection mount towards the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. Ultrasound gel was applied to the upper part of the abdomen and the pancreas was located by using the left kidney and spleen as a reference. Once a clear image of the pancreas was located, a syringe was mounted into the holder and the needle was brought towards the field of view using the x axis micromanipulator. With an appropriate angle, the needle was pierced through the skin and pushed forward until the tip was in the pancreas. KPR172H/+C Spp1 overexpression (n = 10,000) cells and KPR172H/+C control (n = 10,000 cells) cells, suspended in 25 μl of 90% cold growth-factor-reduced Matrigel (Corning), were slowly injected into the pancreas using a 1 ml syringe with a 29 gauge needle. Successful injection was confirmed by the presence of hyperechogenic contrast from the Matrigel inside the pancreas. The needle was slowly withdrawn after 15 s of delay to prevent leakage.

The precise acquisition of ultrasound images of pancreatic tumours was performed using a Microscan transducer MS-550D (VEVO 2100; Visualsonics). Mice were gently anaesthetized with 1.5–2.5% isoflurane in oxygen at a flow rate of 1 l min−1 and placed in a supine position on a preheated (37 °C) ultrasound platform. Pancreatic tumours were located and labelled using the 2D B-mode setting. For tumour volume measurement, consecutive 2D-mode images were acquired by scanning across the entire tumour at intervals of 0.2 mm using the 3D stage control system, and then reconstructed into a 3D volume. The heart rate, respiration rate and body temperature were monitored throughout the scanning process to ensure stable vital signs of the mice. The 3D tumour volume was calculated using the 3D analysis tool Vevo Lab (v.3.2.0).

Organoids were grown to 80–90% confluence before injection. Organoids were dissociated using TrypLE Express supplemented with Y-27632 (10 µM) into single cells and small clusters, and then counted using an automated cell counter. Cells were then resuspended to the indicated concentration in a 50% Matrigel and 50% organoid culturing medium. Next, 50 µl of the cell mixture was injected into the flank of male NSG mice aged 6 weeks. The tumour size was monitored twice weekly with callipers, and tumours were allowed to grow for about 2 months. Tumour volumes were calculated using the formula volume = length × width2/2, as previously described3. Mice were killed at either the study end point or when the tumour reached the maximum allowable volume (tumour volume = 1.5 cm2), and tissues were collected for downstream analyses. The animal use protocol listed was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), Sun Yat-Sen University (approval no. SYSU-IACUC-2025-B0073).

KPR172H/+CY mice (100 days old) were intraperitoneally injected 3 times a week for 3 months with mouse SPP1 antibody (BioxCell, clone MPIIIB10; 200 μg per mouse per injection) or control antibody (mouse IgG isotype control, Cell Sciences; 200 μg per mouse per injection) in independent experiments.

After humane euthanasia, mice were disinfected with 70% ethanol and pancreatic tumours were dissected and placed into ice-cold DMEM–F-12 containing 50 U ml–1 penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The tissue samples were minced on ice using sterile tissue scissors and then incubated in DMEM containing 1 mg ml–1 collagenase V (Sigma-Aldrich) in a shaking incubator for 1 h. After digestion, the process was halted by adding ice-cold G solution, and the cells were centrifuged at 300g for 5 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, the cells underwent further digestion with TrypLE (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by stopping the reaction with ice-cold 2% FCS in PBS and centrifugation. The cells were resuspended, filtered through a 40 μm nylon mesh, centrifuged again and then plated in Matrigel. Organoid medium was used as previously described38. To ensure the selection of cancer cells in the culture, for the first five passages, they were cultured in medium without EGF. After the fifth passage, complete organoid medium was used for culturing and experimentation.

Organoids were grown in chamber slides (Ibidi) and washed twice with ice-cold PBS, fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min and blocked in PBS containing 10% FCS (Gibco), 1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). Primary antibodies were incubated in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight. Fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies together with 3 μM DAPI were incubated in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Stained organoids were imaged on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope and analysed with Imaris (v.9.5.1).

After standard dissection of mice, tumour tissue samples were collected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 h. The tumours were then transferred to 70% ethanol for storage, followed by gradual dehydration in ethanol and embedding in paraffin. The paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned into 4-μm-thick slices. H&E staining and DAB immunohistochemistry were conducted by the Histopathology Core Facility Breast Cancer Research at The Institute of Cancer Research using standard procedures. All staining was carried out using a Dako Autostainer Link48 (Agilent Technologies) immunostaining platform with epitope retrieval and simultaneous dewaxing using the Dako PT Link module (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections were cut at 4 µm onto APEX adhesive slides (Leica Biosystems), dried at 60 °C for 60 min and subject to epitope retrieval at 97 °C for 20 min using either Dako Target Retrieval Solution pH 9 (Agilent Technologies, K800421-2) or pH 6 (Agilent Technologies, K800521-2) as described below. Primary antibodies were diluted in Dako FLEX antibody diluent (Agilent, K800621-2) and endogenous peroxidases were blocked using Dako REAL peroxidase block (Agilent, S202386-2). Antibody binding reactions were visualized using Dako DAB+ (Agilent, K346811-2) and sections were counterstained using Dako FLEX Haematoxylin (Agilent, K800821-2). The following antibodies were used for the indicated experiments: CK19 DSHB rat monoclonal TROMA III (primary dilution 1:200), epitope retrieval = pH 9, detection system = anti-rat N-histofine polymer-HRP (Nichirei Biosciences, 414311F); vimentin, Cell Signaling Technology rabbit monoclonal D21H3, 5741 (primary dilution 1:200), epitope retrieval = pH 9, detection system = Dako rabbit EnVision polymer-HRP (Agilent, K400311-2). Stained slides were imaged on a NanoZoomer (Hamamatsu Photonics) slide scanner and analysed with QuPath (v.0.4.2)39. Analyses and grading of PDACs were performed by a certified pathologist based on H&E staining. For liver and lung metastases, H&E-stained sections of paraffin-embedded tissues were analysed, and the number of metastases per section was quantified using ImageJ.

Paraffin sections from tumour tissues were prepared as described above, and antigen retrieval was performed by heating in 10 mM sodium citrate (Sigma-Aldrich) buffer (adjust pH 6.0 by using hydrochloric acid). The sections were blocked using blocking buffer (PBS containing 10% FCS and 1% BSA from Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 1 h, followed by overnight incubation with primary antibodies prepared in blocking buffer at 4 °C in a cold room. On the next day, fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200) along with 3 μM DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) in blocking buffer were applied in the dark at room temperature for 1 h. A list of the antibodies used is provided in Supplementary Table 2. Before mounting, slides were incubated in 0.1% (w/v) Sudan Black B (Sigma-Aldrich) in fresh 70% ethanol to reduce background signal. Stained slides were imaged on a Leica confocal microscope or a NanoZoomer (Hamamatsu Photonics) slide scanner and analysed using Imaris.

The target gene was deleted in organoids using the CRISPR–Cas9 system. The protocol for engineering organoids was adapted and modified from a previous study40. Organoids were dissociated into single cells using TrypLE and diluted to 1 × 106 cells per electroporation. The cell pellet was then resuspended in a precise 100 μl solution containing BTXpress solution (BTX), 7.2 μg PB-CMV-MCS-EF1a-RFP-T2A-Puro (System Biosciences) or pPB[Exp]-CMV>Hygro (Vectorbuilder), 2.8 μg CMV-pHyPBase or pRP[Exp]-mCherry-CAG>hyPBase (Vectorbuilder), and 10 μg PX330 (provided by F. Zhang, Addgene, 4223062) with a target gRNA. The cell–DNA mixture was transferred to 2 mm electroporation cuvettes (Nepagene) and electroporated using a NEPA21 super electroporator (Nepagene), with settings described in our previous publication41. After electroporation, the cell suspension was transferred to complete medium containing Y-27632 (10 μM) without antibiotics. After 30 min, cells were centrifuged at 300g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in Matrigel and cultured in antibiotic-free complete medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632. On day 5 after electroporation, organoids were selected with 2 μg ml–1 puromycin or 100 mg ml–1 hygromycin B. After 3 days of selection, organoids were flow sorted into single cells into a 96-well plate with 30 μl Matrigel per well. gDNA was extracted using a Purelink Genomic DNA Minikit per the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). PCR was performed using Q5 High-Fidelity 2× master mix (New England Biolabs) with pre-designed primers and gDNA. Subsequently, PCR products were amplified and cloned using a Zero Blunt PCR Cloning kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and sequenced by Sanger sequencing from Genewiz. A list of the gRNAs used is provided in Supplementary Table 3.

Organoids or tissues were dissociated into single cells as mentioned above. Single cells were suspended in FACS buffer (PBS containing 2% FCS). The cells were incubated with fluorophore-conjugated isotype control or experimental antibodies in FACS buffer on ice in the dark for 30 min. A list of the antibodies used is provided in Supplementary Table 2. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS, filtered through a 40 μm nylon mesh (Corning) and then incubated in FACS buffer containing 3 μM DAPI or propidium iodide. Single-colour and fluorescence minus one staining control were used as necessary. The cells were analysed using FACSymphony A5 (BD Biosciences) analyzer. Data were analysed using FlowJo 10 software. The gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2.

RNA was extracted from organoids using either a RNAqueous-Micro Total RNA Isolation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or a RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. For BMP2 and LDN193189 treatment, organoids were starved in DMEM with 1% FCS overnight and treated with vehicle, 100 ng ml–1 recombinant BMP2 Protein (R&D Systems) or 100 nM LDN193189 (Tocris) for 12 h, followed by RNA extraction from the cells. cDNA was generated using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was diluted 1:10 in distilled water, and 2 μl was used per qPCR reaction. PowerUp SYBR Green master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for qPCR on an ABI7500 or QuantStudio 6 Flex (Applied Biosystems) system. Primers were designed using the Primer-BLAST tool at NCBI and made by Sigma-Aldrich. Housekeeping gene mRNA levels (Actb or Rplp0) were used for normalization. mRNA levels were quantified using the difference in Ct values and calculated using the \({2}^{-\Delta \Delta {C}_{{\rm{t}}}}\) method42. A list of the qPCR primers used is provided in Supplementary Table 4.

Matrigel was removed from cells on ice using Cell Recovery solution (Corning) following the manufacturer's instructions. The Matrigel-depleted cells were lysed in ice-cold cell lysis buffer (NEB) as previously described3. After brief sonication, lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 r.p.m. for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein quantification was performed using a Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad), and proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE on 10% gels (Bio-Rad), then transferred onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) using a Trans-Blot Turbo system (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were blocked in TBST containing 3% BSA at room temperature for 1 h, then incubated with primary antibodies prepared in TBST with 1% BSA overnight at 4 °C. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were subsequently incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Chemiluminescence was detected using Amersham ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection reagent (GE Healthcare) in an Amersham ImageQuant 800 imaging system. A list of the antibodies used is provided in Supplementary Table 2.

The Itgb3 overexpression, Spp1 overexpression, SPP1 overexpression, control and GFP vectors were purchased from Vectorbuilder. GFP and inducible Grem1 were cloned into pLenti6 V5-DEST (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or pInducer20-Blast (Addgene, 109334) using the BP and LR Recombination System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Lentiviral particles were produced in HEK293T cells using psPAX2 and pMD2.G helper plasmids (Addgene) and transfected into HEK293T cells using jetPRIME transfection reagent (jetPRIME). For organoid infection, a single-cell suspension was prepared and incubated with lentiviruses supplemented with 4 μg ml–1 polybrene (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in a rocking incubator for 6 h. Cells were then seeded in Matrigel and antibiotic selection was applied 3 days later.

To predict transcription factor binding motifs in the Bmp2 promoter, DNA sequences ranging from −1000 to +500 bp from the transcription start site were scanned in the JASPAR 2000 database (http://jaspar.genereg.net/) using a relative profile score threshold of 80%. The JASPAR relative score is defined as 1 for the maximum-likelihood binding site21.

Organoids were dissociated and plated on 2D culture dishes and cultured in DMEM with 5% FCS. After exponential growth, the cells were switched to DMEM containing 1% FCS and starved overnight, followed by treatment with vehicle or 5Z-7-oxozeaenol for 6 h. The cells were fixed and crosslinked chromatin was prepared as previously described3. For immunoprecipitation, 10 μg chromatin was incubated with 10 μl anti-histone H3 rabbit IgG (CST, used as a positive control), 2 μl normal rabbit IgG (CST) or 5 μl of anti-RelA antibody (CST) overnight at 4 °C. Before immunoprecipitation, 2% of the chromatin (v/v) was used as input. Protein G magnetic beads were used to capture chromatin–protein–antibody complexes, followed by reversal of crosslinking to release chromatin and purification using a SimpleChIP Enzymatic Chromatin IP kit (CST). DNA was quantified by qPCR using primers targeting predicted Rela-binding regions at the Bmp2 promoter. The DNA level was normalized to the input, and the fold enrichment was calculated by normalizing to the control. A list of the chromatin immunoprecipitation qPCR primers is provided in Supplementary Table 5. A list of the antibodies used is provided in Supplementary Table 2.

For the RNA-seq analysis of Spp1 and Itgb3 WT and knockout organoids, RNA was extracted from organoids using a RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. mRNA capture and library preparation were performed by Genewiz. Biological replicate libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq platform at Genewiz, which generated an average of approximately 25 million 150 bp paired-end reads per sample. Sequence reads were processed using Trimmomatic (v.0.36) to remove possible adapter sequences and nucleotides with poor quality43. Reads were aligned to the mouse reference assembly to the Mus musculus GRCm38 reference genome available on ENSEMBL using STAR aligner (v.2.5.2b)44. Normalization of raw counts and regularized log-transformation were performed as previously described3.

For the RNA-seq dataset of Spp1 and Itgb3 WT and knockout organoids, GSEA (v.4.0.3) analysis was performed using the rlog-transformed counts, with the following settings applied: number of permutations = 1000, permutation type = gene set, enrichment statistics = weighted, metric for ranking genes = Signal2Noise. Normalized expression values of PDAC samples from the datasets GSE71729, ICGCarray, ICGCseq, TCGA, GSE62452 and GSE79668 were batch corrected using ComBat algorithm. Samples were grouped into SPP1high and SPP1low based on the median expression level. For GSEA, the following settings were applied: including the number of permutations = 1000, permutation type = phenotype, enrichment statistics = weighted, metric for ranking genes = Signal2Noise. The EMT gene set of 200 genes was checked for significant enrichment with an FDR q < 0.2.

For human PDAC scRNA-seq data, fastq files of 24 PDAC and 11 normal pancreas samples were downloaded from the Chinese National Genomics Data Center (Genome Sequence Archive: CRA001160) and processed as previously described45. Uniform manifold approximation and projection plots were generated using the R package Seurat (v.3.2.2) with default settings. Cells were coloured according to cluster assignments from the reference. For evaluating SPP1 expression and its association with EMT in ductal cells (type 1 and 2), raw counts were normalized to counts per million (CPM) using the edgeR package in R (v.4.0.3) and log2[CPM + 1] transformed. Cells belonging to ductal clusters 1 and 2 were categorized into SPP1high and SPP1low based on expression levels.

Diagrams in Fig. 1a and Extended Data Figs. 7a, 10a, 11a and 12 were created in BioRender (https://biorender.com).

All images and graphs represent the results of multiple experiments, which were conducted on different biological replicate samples and different dates. Each experiment was independently repeated. Differential gene expression analysis for RNA-seq data was performed using the edgeR package in R. All other statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 8 for Windows. Specific statistical tests are specified in the figure legends. All t-tests tests, Fisher-exact tests and Mann–Whitney tests were two-sided.

The survival plots for Spp1fl/fl KPFCT and Spp1WT/WT KPFCT mice receiving tamoxifen treatment and for Spp1fl/fl KPCY, Spp1WT/WT KPCY mice and SPP1 neutralization experiments were created and analysed using two-sided log-rank tests in GraphPad Prism 8. The following PDAC datasets were used: GSE71729, ICGCarray, ICGCseq, TCGA, GSE62452 and GSE79668. The normalized ComBat batch-corrected expression values were used for categorizing samples to SPP1high and SPP1low based on surv_cutpoint function in survminer R package. This function determines the optimal cut-off by maximally selected rank statistics.

The concentration of proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions must be tightly controlled to maintain cellular homeostasis1,2. However, mechanisms for collective control of these proteins, which tend to localize to membraneless condensates, are less understood than pathways mediated by membrane-bound organelles3,4. Here we report ‘interstasis', a homeostatic mechanism in which increased concentration of proteins within RNA–protein condensates induces the sequestration of their own mRNAs. The selectivity of interstatic mRNA capture relies on the structure of the genetic code and conserved codon biases, which ensure that similar multivalent RNA regions encode similar low-complexity domains. For example, arginine-enriched mixed charge domains (R-MCDs) tend to be encoded by repetitive purine-rich sequences in mRNAs. Accumulation of proteins containing R-MCDs increases the cohesion of nuclear speckles, which induces selective capture of purine-rich multivalent mRNAs. The multivalent regions are bound by specific RNA-binding proteins, including TRA2 proteins, which relocalize to speckles upon interstasis to promote selective mRNA capture. CLK-mediated phosphorylation of TRA2 proteins counters their localization to speckles, thereby modulating interstasis. Thus, the condensation properties of nuclear speckles act as a sensor for interstasis, a collective negative-feedback loop that co-regulates mRNAs of highly dosage-sensitive genes, which primarily encode nuclear condensation-prone proteins.

Fitness screens in multiple eukaryotic species have shown that proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are more likely to be toxic when their dosage is increased1. The toxicity induced by the increased dosage of individual IDR-containing proteins in yeast has been linked to their propensity to phase separate and form biomolecular condensates3. Proteins that are prone to phase separation have the greatest mismatch between protein and RNA abundance, indicating that post-transcriptional mechanisms strongly affect the protein abundance1,2. Many proteins can interact with the RNA or DNA of their own gene, yet no sensors or effectors are known that could regulate the collective expression of condensation-prone proteins5,6,7,8.

Co-condensation of proteins is partly determined by the molecular grammar of short motifs and biophysically similar amino acids in their IDRs9,10,11,12. Many IDRs contain repetitive amino acid arrangements and are thus classified as low-complexity domains (LCDs). One type of LCD is the R-MCD, where arginines are interspersed among other positively and negatively charged amino acids. R-MCDs promote localization of proteins into nuclear speckles10. Major overexpression of artificial R-MCDs has been shown to increase speckle cohesion to the extent that all polyadenylated mRNAs can become retained in the speckles, highlighting the need for homeostatic co-regulation of such proteins10.

Biophysically similar amino acids tend to have similar codons, a characteristic of genetic code that is thought to have emerged to mitigate the effects of non-synonymous point mutations or translation errors13,14. We asked whether the mRNA regions that encode LCDs contain repetitive arrangements of similar sequences, termed ‘multivalent regions'. To generalize the analysis of multivalent RNA sequences beyond specific motif sets, we designed a scoring algorithm that assigns a generalized RNA multivalency (GeRM) score for each nucleotide within provided RNA sequences (Fig. 1a). For a given k-mer at each position along a transcript, a GeRM score is calculated by assessing the similarity of surrounding k-mers, weighted based on the proximity between k-mers (Fig. 1a). A high GeRM score thus indicates that the k-mer is present in highly multivalent RNA regions, where large numbers of similar k-mers are found in close proximity (Fig. 1b). We applied the GeRM algorithm to the longest coding transcript isoform for every human gene and then focused our analyses on the coding sequences (CDSs). For example, the profile of LUC7L3 mRNA reveals a region of high GeRM scores (‘GeRM region') that is highly GA rich and that encodes exclusively charged amino acids (Fig. 1c,d).

We first systematically defined the GeRM regions that were above the threshold of the 98th percentile of the smoothed GeRM scores. To assess the complexity of amino acid sequences in GeRM regions, we calculated their information entropy using a sliding window and found that their entropy was significantly lower than the remaining sequences of the same proteins and to the average throughout the proteome, demonstrating that GeRM regions commonly encode LCDs (Fig. 1e). Moreover, we used AlphaFold2 prediction confidence to approximate protein disorder and found that GeRM regions preferentially encode IDRs, as they are not predicted to be structured (Fig. 1f).

If RNA multivalency was functionally important, one would expect a selection pressure for biases in codon usage that reinforce the multivalency of LCD-encoding regions. To examine such biases, we synonymously shuffled the codons within each transcript and calculated the mean GeRM potential across ten shuffles (Fig. 1c,g). In the example of LUC7L3, codon choices reinforce the GA richness of the CDS region that encodes an R-MCD and is almost entirely composed of charged amino acids (Fig. 1c,d). Conversely, in the example of CCDC61, codon choices reinforce the G richness of the CDS region that encodes an LCD that contains only approximately 40% of charged amino acids and is rich in arginines, alanines and glycines (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b).

To more broadly assess how codon biases reinforce the multivalency of LCD-encoding CDS regions, we then defined LCDs as regions in the bottom 2% of amino acid entropy (Supplementary Table 7). The GeRM potential in regions encoding LCDs was markedly higher than in the rest of the CDS, but synonymously shuffling the codons either across the transcriptome or within each transcript significantly reduced the GeRM potential (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 1h). This suggests that, especially in regions encoding LCDs, codon choices tend to promote the multivalency potential of the RNA.

We speculated that if codon usage supports high multivalency of sequences encoding LCDs, then these codon usage biases would be evolutionarily conserved. We tested every possible synonymous codon substitution in the transcriptome and calculated the change in GeRM potential of each overlapping 5-mer (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Next, we compared the GeRM potentials of the native k-mers and the mutated k-mers. When the ratio of native to mutated GeRM potential is high, then the native codon usage promotes the local multivalency potential. The average ratio for all but four possible synonymously mutable codons was positive, with more common codons having higher ratios on average (Extended Data Fig. 1d). To account for the general differences in amino acid composition and conservation of LCDs (Extended Data Fig. 1f), we normalized the conservation of each synonymously mutable codon and then compared the conservation of the synonymously mutable nucleotide (typically the wobble position) to the conservation of the middle nucleotide in each codon, which can never be synonymously mutated. We found that the more strongly a native codon promotes multivalency, the more conserved the codon is across mammals or vertebrates, and that this effect is especially strong within the regions that encode LCDs (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 1e,g). This analysis suggests that evolutionary selection pressure tends to preserve codons that enhance high multivalency potential of RNA sequences encoding LCDs.

To understand whether RNA multivalency could serve as a template for co-regulation of co-condensing proteins, we assessed its relationships to the LCD molecular grammar. We calculated the contribution of each 5-mer to the total GeRM score of each region, reduced the dimensionality of the data with UMAP and clustered all protein-coding GeRM regions using HDBSCAN. We observed diverse clusters, some of which represented trinucleotide repeats, whereas the largest clusters lacked stereotyped repetition: a GC-rich cluster, a C-rich cluster and three GA-rich clusters (one cluster with more adenines, one with more guanines and one with interspersed cytosines; Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 6). All types of GeRM regions encoded LCDs (Extended Data Fig. 2d), and GeRM regions with similar multivalent RNA motifs tend to encode LCDs that are dominated by similar amino acids (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 2b). The GA-rich GeRM regions encoded domains rich in charged amino acids, with the ratio of adenine to guanine in the multivalent motifs biasing the encoded domain towards positive or negative charge, respectively.

Species to the right of the dashed vertical line are amniotes. The black dashed line denotes no correlation.

Next, we asked whether each type of GeRM region is enriched in mRNAs that encode proteins with related functions. We performed an ontology analysis of gene sets containing each type of GeRM region and found that each set was associated with specific terms (Fig. 2c). The GA-rich GeRM regions were primarily associated with nuclear RNA regulation or chromatin-related terms, whereas GC-rich and CAG-repeat GeRM regions were enriched mainly for transcription-related terms, which agrees with previous studies showing GC bias for codons in transcription factors15. The C-rich GeRM regions were most enriched in the SH3 domain and actin-binding terms, whereas the CU-rich regions were enriched for keratin filament genes. Therefore, each type of RNA multivalency in CDS regions is linked to specific classes of LCDs and enriched in functionally related groups of transcripts.

All RNA multivalency classes in coding regions are reinforced by biased codon usage, as evident by significantly decreased RNA multivalency in all types of GeRM regions after codon shuffling (Extended Data Fig. 2e). These biases are driven mainly by codon choice for amino acids that contain a large number of possible codons, such as arginine, which is common in multiple types of LCDs (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 2c). We calculated the arginine codon usage within each LCD that contained at least 20% arginine (R-LCDs), which could be separated based on codon-usage principal component into those encoded primarily by GA-rich or CG-rich codons (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Those with GA-rich arginine codons were highly enriched for other charged residues and thus included R-MCDs (Extended Data Fig. 3c,f), whereas R-LCDs with CG-rich codons contained more proline, alanine and glycine (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Of note, the GA-biased R-LCDs are much more highly enriched for nuclear speckle, mRNA-processing and RNA-binding Gene Ontology terms compared with GC-rich R-LCDs (Fig. 2e). Conversely, mRNAs encoding proteins with nuclear speckle or RNA-binding Gene Ontology terms show a strong bias towards GA-rich arginine codons (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). Therefore, arginine codon choice within GeRM regions conforms to the multivalent identity of the region by mimicking the sequences of other codons encoding charged amino acids, thereby maximizing the multivalency of RNA regions encoding functionally distinct classes of R-LCD. As representative examples, the arginine codon biases in LUC7L3 and CCDC61 R-LCDs reinforce their distinct AG-rich and CG-rich multivalency, respectively (Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Fig. 1a,b).

As a measure of the distinct arginine codon preference in the two classes of R-LCDs, we observed a positive correlation in R-LCDs between AGA, AGG and CGA arginine codons, and between CGG and CGC codons, and strong anticorrelations between these two groups (Fig. 2d). We used this approach to ask at what point in evolution this codon bias in R-LCDs emerged. We observed the correlations and anticorrelations between AG and CG arginine codons in R-LCDs across a diverse range of species. Although the total proportions of R-LCDs did not dramatically change across species (Extended Data Fig. 3g,h), we observed that the correlations between CG-rich codons, between GA-rich codons and the anticorrelation between these groups were stable from humans to reptiles, but that this pattern was less pronounced in amphibians and other species that diverged earlier in evolutionary history (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 3i). Thus, the codon biases that reinforce the distinct RNA multivalency of two R-LCD classes have become most pronounced in terrestrial vertebrates.

As the accumulation of R-MCDs affects the properties of nuclear speckles10, we investigated whether speckles enable any feedback regulation of R-MCD proteins, and whether GA-rich GeRM regions have any role in such regulation. To assess this, we combined the region encoding the R-MCD C terminus of peptidylprolyl isomerase G (PPIG; Fig. 3a) fused to mScarlet into a doxycycline-inducible PiggyBac vector, which was integrated into a stable polyclonal HeLa cell population. After 16 h of induction, we observed mScarlet–PPIGLCD localization to the nucleus, where it colocalized with SC35, a nuclear speckle marker (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Expression of PPIGLCD resulted in fewer, larger speckles per nucleus, without reducing the intensity of SC35 staining (Extended Data Fig. 4e), consistent with previously reported effects of R-MCDs on speckles10.

We first asked whether the expression of the R-MCD had a dose-dependent effect on the nuclear–cytoplasmic localization of endogenous GA-rich mRNAs. We performed 3′ end sequencing on the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of our reporter cell line after 0, 4, 8 and 12 h of mScarlet–PPIGLCD induction to assess the effect of its gradual accumulation (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 3). We then categorized genes based on their total CDS GA multivalency and looked at the nuclear–cytoplasmic distribution of these genes over time. The nuclear–cytoplasmic distribution of most mRNAs was unaffected by the expression of the reporter construct, but the group of mRNAs with high GA-rich multivalency became increasingly enriched in the nucleus over time, with a quantitative relationship between the degree of GA-rich multivalency and the degree of nuclear retention (Fig. 3c).

To investigate the effect of the observed nuclear retention of GA-rich multivalent transcripts on protein synthesis, we performed pulsed stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (pSILAC). PPIGLCD expression was induced for 12 h, followed by an 8-h pulse labelling period to selectively label and quantify proteins newly synthesized during the PPIGLCD induction window. Comparison of heavy-to-light peptide ratios between doxycycline-induced and uninduced controls revealed a selective decrease in the proportion of labelled peptides encoded by mRNAs with high GA multivalency (Fig. 3d), with minimal effect observed on the translation of all other proteins. Thus, the nuclear retention of GA-rich multivalent transcripts upon PPIGLCD expression corresponds with downregulated translation of the proteins that these mRNAs encode.

To determine whether GA-rich transcripts are specifically sequestered into nuclear speckles, we designed hybridization chain reaction fluorescence in situ hybridization (HCR-FISH) probes against five GA-rich multivalent mRNAs and two non-multivalent control mRNAs. We then induced PPIGLCD expression for 16 h and performed HCR-FISH along with SC35 immunofluorescence (Fig. 3e,f and Extended Data Fig. 4h,i). We found a dose-dependent increase in the proportion of single-molecule FISH (smFISH) signal in the speckles relative to the nucleoplasm for all five multivalent RNAs, but not for either of the two control mRNAs, as evidenced by the slopes and fits of the regression models (Fig. 3g,h and Extended Data Fig. 4j,k). These observations correspond to changes in nuclear–cytoplasmic distribution in our sequencing experiments (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Under these conditions we also observed a slight dose-dependent enrichment of poly-A+ mRNA in nuclear speckles, accompanied by a mild increase in the proportion of nuclear mRNA, indicating that mRNA sequestration is selective (Extended Data Fig. 4d,f,g).

We next asked whether this effect is generalizable across R-MCDs. We transfected HeLa cells with mGreenLantern-fused R-MCDs from three additional proteins (LUC7L3, PRPF38B and SRSF11) and repeated HCR-FISH 24 h post-transfection, with two GA-rich multivalent mRNAs and two non-multivalent controls (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). This induced the selective speckle retention of GA-rich mRNAs, consistent with our observations with PPIGLCD (Extended Data Fig. 5d). We did not observe this effect when transfecting other LCDs with different amino acid identities (Extended Data Fig. 5e–g). We conclude that variations in the concentration of any given R-MCD, or variations in the combined concentrations of all R-MCDs, drive the selective retention of GA-rich mRNAs in nuclear speckles. We quantified PPIGLCD expression at the protein and RNA level and found that a 15% increase in the total abundance of R-MCDs in the cell is sufficient to induce selective mRNA retention (Extended Data Fig. 4i,m). Thus, modest changes in the concentration of R-MCDs can selectively control the export of mRNAs containing GA-rich GeRM regions, which encode R-MCD or other charged proteins.

To assess whether the nuclear retention of GA-rich mRNAs decreases the synthesis of encoded proteins, we created codon-biased versions of a GA-rich region in LUC7L3 mRNA that encodes an R-MCD (Fig. 1c,d), such that it either had a high or low GA multivalency but equivalent GC content. We then cloned this region as a 3′ untranslated region (UTR) sequence downstream of a CDS encoding mGreenLantern. We transfected each of these two constructs into our mScarlet–PPIGLCD reporter cell line, induced PPIGLCD expression for 16 h, and measured the intensity of mScarlet and mGreenLantern in each cell. We found that as the expression of mScarlet–PPIGLCD increased, expression of mGreenLantern strongly decreased when the 3′ UTR of mGreenLantern contained a highly multivalent GA-rich sequence, whereas the effect was significantly weaker when the sequence was codon biased to decrease the GA content (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Thus, modestly increased concentration of an R-MCD protein decreases the synthesis of other R-MCD proteins due to the broad effect on the retention of endogenous GA-rich mRNAs. We refer to this mutual homeostatic co-regulation of LCD-containing proteins as interstasis.

To further characterize the proteins that are co-regulated through interstasis, we examined the properties of the proteins encoded by mRNAs that were significantly retained in the nucleus after PPIGLCD expression. These proteins are enriched in IDRs, which are longer than average and have increased densities of charged amino acids (Fig. 4a,b and Extended Data Fig. 4c) and to a lesser extent also non-charged polar amino acids (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Moreover, their genes are enriched for ontology terms related to the nuclear speckle, chromatin remodelling, RNA binding and RNA processing (Extended Data Fig. 6k). To account for the strong enrichment of Gene Ontology terms related to nuclear compartments, we compared all proteins that localize to speckles, nucleoplasm or nuclear bodies as defined by the Human Protein Atlas16 to the subset of these proteins that are co-regulated through interstasis, and found that these have extremely high condensation potential as predicted by the FuzDrop model17 (Extended Data Fig. 6d).

Genes encoding IDR-containing proteins were reported to be more dosage sensitive in yeast, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans1. Therefore, we analysed the dosage sensitivity that was estimated from the analysis of rare copy-number variants in the human genome18. This identified a striking trend for bidirectional dosage sensitivity of the genes encoding nuclear proteins that are under interstatic co-regulation, with high pHaplo and pTriplo scores that correspond to haploinsufficiency and triplosensitivity (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). Furthermore, bidirectional dosage sensitivity was confirmed by gnomAD scores, showing higher mutational constraint of genes under interstatic regulation than controls19 (Extended Data Fig. 6g,h). Thus, interstasis enables homeostatic dosage co-regulation of genes that are bidirectionally dosage sensitive and mutationally constrained. Finally, the genes under interstatic co-regulation had higher scores by the dosage sensitivity-based phase separation predictor model (DosPS)20, confirming the combined trends for strong dosage sensitivity and the high condensation potential of their proteins (Fig. 4c). We thus propose that interstasis protects from the toxicity that can arise from deregulation of the most dosage-sensitive genes through its collective homeostatic regulation of the most condensation-prone proteins.

The packaging and compaction of mRNPs have been recognized as important steps in mRNA maturation and export21,22. When an intron is removed from pre-mRNA, the spliceosome deposits the exon junction complex (EJC) upstream of the exon–exon junction. The EJC promotes the packaging of the mRNA into a compact mRNP, facilitating the loading of further mRNA export factors22. Previous work has shown that both mRNA sequence and gene architecture can influence mRNA export, but the relationship between sequence-specific RBP assemblies and mRNP packaging remains incompletely understood23,24,25. We reasoned that EJC deposition upstream of exon–exon junctions could limit the accessibility of multivalent sequences, preventing interstatic regulation. To assess this, we trained a random forest classifier to predict transcripts that become retained in the nucleus after 12 h of PPIGLCD expression. The input features of the model included total CDS length, mean exon length (inversely proportional to EJC density) and multivalent RNA features. We trained an array of models using a stepwise feature-selection approach to find that a combination of four features — CDS length, mean exon length, GA-rich and CAG-rich multivalency — led to a model with the best predictive performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.87; Fig. 4d). All of these features individually contributed to mRNA responsiveness; CDS length (AUROC = 0.83) was the strongest determinant of responsiveness, whereas GA-rich and CAG-rich multivalency, as well as mean exon length, further improved the performance of the model (Extended Data Fig. 6l–o). Furthermore, when we categorized mRNAs based on whether 50% of their GA-rich multivalency was within 50 nt of the expected EJC-binding region, GA-rich multivalent sequences were less capable of inducing nuclear mRNA retention upon PPIGLCD overexpression when they were proximal to the EJC (Extended Data Fig. 6i,j).

To address the importance of EJC density and sequence multivalency in the absence of variable CDS length, we designed a novel reporter system in which mScarlet–PPIGLCD is encoded with variable codon choices and variable exon number, whereas its CDS length remains constant. This allowed us to assess whether EJC density could limit the accessibility of multivalent RNA for RBP assembly (Fig. 4e). The reporter plasmid pool was generated by Gibson assembly of eight fragments in sequence, each of which varied in two ways: having GA-rich or GA-poor codons, and either containing or lacking an intron, in which intron splicing efficiency was maximized using in silico mutagenesis to maximize SpliceAI scores26. The combination of these two variables leads to four possible options for each fragment of the CDS (Fig. 4f). This generated a library of reporter sequences that all produced the same protein but differed at the RNA level in their degree of GA-rich multivalency and in the number of constitutive introns (Fig. 4f). As previous work has implicated transcript GC content in the steady-state nuclear–cytoplasmic abundances, we ensured that the GC content of the CDS was kept constant25. Owing to the constraints on GC content and splicing efficiency, the most highly multivalent sequence was marginally less multivalent than the native RNA sequence that encodes PPIGLCD, whereas the least multivalent sequence was still more multivalent than most random CDSs of the same length (Supplementary Fig. 2b).

Gibson assembly yielded a pool of approximately 45,000 uniquely barcoded plasmids as identified by targeted sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 2c), with a comparable representation of all possible fragments (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Sixteen hours after transfecting this plasmid pool, we isolated the RNA and confirmed with long-read sequencing that all the introns in the reporter were efficiently spliced (Supplementary Fig. 2d–f). Given the roles of nuclear speckles in enhancing splicing efficiency27, this enabled us to rule out inefficient splicing as a confounding factor influencing RNA localization. Next, we collected RNA from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions at 16 h post-transfection and performed targeted sequencing of the plasmid barcodes. Of note, the nuclear retention of reporter mRNAs scaled with the degree of GA-rich multivalency (Extended Data Fig. 7a). To test whether the degree of nuclear retention depends on the extent of the R-MCD expression, we generated a stable inducible pooled cell line expressing the library of reporter constructs, induced expression for 4, 8 and 12 h, and sequenced the nuclear and cytoplasmic barcodes at each timepoint. The nuclear retention of highly multivalent sequences was significantly stronger at 12 h than at 4 or 8 h (Fig. 4g). We replicated this effect by transfecting the reporter plasmid pool for 8 or 24 h and sequencing the nuclear and cytoplasmic barcodes (Extended Data Fig. 7b). To assess the stability of the reporter transcripts, we induced the pool for 16 h, sequenced the RNA after 0, 2, 4 and 8 h, and found no relationship between the multivalency of transcripts and their stability (Extended Data Fig. 7f). Therefore, the expression level of the R-MCD dictates the selective nuclear retention of its own multivalent mRNAs.

We also addressed the role of splicing-mediated EJC loading with our reporter system, because in the reporter pool each of the eight fragments had a chance to contain an intron, thus the total number of exons varied between reporters. If all 8 fragments included an intron, there were 9 exons between 162 and 211 nt in length, whereas most reporters had 5–6 exons. Exon number alone had a weak influence on the nuclear–cytoplasmic distribution of reporter transcripts (Extended Data Fig. 7c). However, for the more multivalent reporter transcripts, exon content had a strong effect on nuclear retention: if a reporter transcript had a small number of longer exons, it was increasingly retained over time, but if a reporter had a greater number of shorter exons, it did not accumulate in the nucleus (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 7e). We observed the same effect, although weaker, when transfecting the plasmid pool, suggesting that chromatin context may promote the EJC-dependent mRNP packaging (Extended Data Fig. 7d). This confirms that multivalent GA-rich RNA sequences confer the greatest potential for nuclear retention when they are positioned inside long exons, where multivalent RBP assemblies are less able to be influenced by EJC-mediated mRNP packaging.

Previous insights from the RNA binding of TDP-43 demonstrated that its condensation promotes binding to highly multivalent RNA regions, which includes binding to its own GU-multivalent mRNA that promotes homeostatic control of TDP-43 dosage28. Here we asked whether increased condensation of nuclear speckles could promote the capacity of specific RBPs to recruit GA-multivalent mRNAs into speckles and thus enable interstasis. To identify the RBPs that might bind to GA-multivalent mRNAs in interstasis, we first investigated how the GA multivalency of reporter constructs correlates with the abundance of high-affinity binding motifs for different RBPs. We obtained significantly enriched 5-mers for 79 RBPs (P < 0.05) from RNA-Bind-N-Seq experiments29,30,31 and used the abundance of these 5-mers and their Z scores to assign a binding potential score to each reporter sequence. We found that GA multivalency had the strongest correlation with the binding potential scores of nuclear speckle proteins TRA2A (r = 0.97) and TRA2B (r = 0.95; Fig. 4i). Thus, the synonymous mutations of arginine codons are expected to promote binding of TRA2 proteins to the GA-rich multivalent regions, which could mediate the variable nuclear retention of the reporter library.

Next, we gathered public iCLIP and eCLIP datasets32,33,34,35,36 and identified RBPs that preferentially bind to multivalent regions in the CDS. To identify RBPs with preference for multivalent sequences, we determined whether RBPs preferred to bind to a motif when it was in a highly multivalent context, rather than when the same motif was surrounded by dissimilar sequences. For example, UPF1 shows no bias towards multivalency for its most bound motifs, whereas TRA2B strongly prefers to bind to its most bound motifs in a multivalent context (Extended Data Fig. 8i,j). This identified 34 CLIP datasets in which protein had a preference to bind its favoured motifs in a more multivalent context (Fig. 5a, y axis). To determine the preferences for specific types of multivalencies, we then compared the density of crosslink sites within each type of CDS GeRM region to the rest of the CDS of that transcript, which showed that each type of GeRM region shows enriched binding of specific sets of RBPs (Fig. 5a). The GA-rich multivalent regions were bound by a large number of RBPs that have been observed to be enriched in nuclear speckles32,37,38 (Fig. 5a, bold), including six SR proteins that preferentially assemble on GA-rich GeRM regions, with the TRA2 SR proteins showing the strongest enrichment on these regions.

For example, TRA2 and several other SR proteins bind strongly and specifically to the GA-rich GeRM region that encodes the charged disordered domain of APP (Fig. 5b). We also performed iCLIP for endogenous TRA2B from mouse embryonic stem cells, which confirmed the strong enrichment around the GA-rich GeRM regions of CDSs (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b), and additionally showed that iCLIP reads were more likely to contain a splice junction when the protein was bound to a GA-rich exon, confirming that TRA2B remains bound to multivalent sites post-splicing (Extended Data Fig. 8c). Thus, analyses of reporter and CLIP experiments provide independent lines of evidence implicating TRA2 proteins as likely effectors of interstasis in nuclear speckles.

TRA2 proteins are known to enhance splicing of GA-rich exons33. We therefore analysed public data in which TRA2A and TRA2B were co-depleted, which increases skipping of both alternative and constitutive exons33, but found no trend for skipping of the exons with GA-multivalent GeRM regions (Extended Data Fig. 8d,e). Moreover, data from VastDB39 demonstrate that the GA-multivalent exons from the mRNAs that are retained upon interstasis are highly constitutive across all available human tissues (Extended Data Fig. 8f). In addition, our randomized reporter analysis did not show any link between GA-rich exons and splicing changes of either the exons or their flanking introns during interstasis (Supplementary Fig. 2f). We conclude that binding of SR proteins to highly multivalent GA-rich exons is rarely associated with the modulation of alternative splicing.

For a protein to be an effector of the interstatic dosage loop, it should be sensitive to the dose of R-MCD proteins. Indeed, TRA2B was diffuse throughout the nucleoplasm in the absence of PPIGLCD expression, with only mild colocalization with the nuclear speckle marker SC35, but became enriched in nuclear speckles 16 h after the induction of PPIGLCD (Fig. 5c,d). The degree of speckle localization correlated with the dose of PPIGLCD, similar to retained GA-rich mRNAs. The same dose variations of R-MCD protein induced speckle retention of TRA2B and nuclear GA-rich mRNA to a similar extent, indicating that TRA2B could be an effector that drives the sequestration of GA-rich mRNAs in the nuclear speckle.

To demonstrate the role of TRA2 proteins in modulating selective purinergic mRNA sequestration, we performed short-interfering (siRNA)-mediated depletion of TRA2A and TRA2B in cells expressing PPIGLCD (Extended Data Fig. 8g,h and Supplementary Fig. 1a). Using HCR-FISH of EIF3A to examine the degree of GA-rich transcript retention in nuclear speckles, we showed a dose-dependent relationship of the effect of TRA2 proteins on EIF3A mRNA localization. Cells were grouped by their PPIGLCD expression intensity to ensure that observed effects were not attributed to changes in PPIGLCD expression driven by TRA2 depletion itself. At lower levels of PPIGLCD expression that are sufficient to promote the retention of EIF3A mRNA in nuclear speckles in control conditions, double TRA2A/B knockdown significantly decreased speckle retention of EIF3A (Fig. 5e,f). When R-MCD concentrations become very high, the effect of TRA2A/B knockdown diminished, indicating that at such concentrations, other RBPs that assemble on GA-rich multivalent regions could also drive speckle mRNA retention (Fig. 5a,b). This suggests that TRA2 proteins are key effectors of interstasis upon modest accumulation of R-MCDs, which more probably represents physiological variation.

To determine whether the R-MCD proteins or their GA-rich mRNA itself drives the relocalization of TRA2B to the nuclear speckle, we created a construct encoding mGreenLantern fused to the R-MCD of LUC7L3 (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Two versions of each construct were made with opposing codon biases in LUC7L3, to create either GA-rich or GA-poor sequences (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Upon transfection of the constructs, the LUC7L3 R-MCD protein localized to nuclear speckles, and it drove the speckle localization of TRA2B regardless of whether it was expressed from GA-rich or GA-poor sequences (Extended Data Fig. 9b,d,e). We also created a construct in which a stop codon had been inserted upstream of the GA-rich sequence that would otherwise encode the LUC7L3 R-MCD, thus making it part of the 3′ UTR, and this construct had no effect on TRA2B localization (Extended Data Fig. 9c–e). This confirmed that accumulation of R-MCD proteins, rather than their mRNAs, drives TRA2B relocalization, and TRA2B promotes the sequestration of GA-rich mRNA into the speckles.

Localization of SR proteins within nuclear speckles is regulated by their phosphorylation via various kinases, such as the CDC2-like (CLK) family of kinases40,41. Previous work has indicated that serine phosphorylation in SR domains disrupts arginine-driven self-association in nuclear speckles10. CLK kinase activity is regulated under a diverse array of physiological contexts, including during the cell cycle and in response to small variations in temperature42,43. Given the role of TRA2, and probably other SR proteins, as mediators of interstasis, we asked whether the set point of interstasis could be modulated by the activity of CLK kinases.

We treated HeLa cells for 8 h with 1 µM CLK-IN-T3, a selective inhibitor of CLK1, CLK2 and CLK3 (ref. 44), and confirmed that TRA2B and other SR proteins became less heavily phosphorylated (Extended Data Fig. 10j and Supplementary Fig. 1b). We observed that CLK-IN-T3 treatment induced a strong relocalization of TRA2B to nuclear speckles, and a mild enrichment of poly-A+ mRNA in the nucleus, especially within speckles (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig. 10a–c). Upon 16 h of CLK-IN-T3 treatment, speckles became larger and fewer in number (Extended Data Fig. 10g,h). Thus, CLK kinase inhibition produces a similar phenotype to the overexpression of an R-MCD with regards to mRNA and TRA2B localization and nuclear speckle morphology.

To test the selectivity of speckle mRNA localization, we repeated HCR-FISH after 16 h of CLK-IN-T3 treatment, which significantly increased the localization of the GA-rich EIF3A and BRD4 mRNAs, but not control mRNAs, to nuclear speckles relative to the nucleoplasm (Fig. 6b and Extended Data Fig. 10d–f). To assess the sequence-specific effect on mRNA retention using our reporter system, we treated cells with 1 µM CLK-IN-T3 or DMSO for 2 h, then induced the expression of the reporter transcript pool with doxycycline for 6 h, at which point the expression of the PPIGLCD protein is still negligible, and performed targeted sequencing of the reporter mRNAs. We found that CLK inhibition significantly increased the nuclear retention of the GA-multivalent reporter transcripts (Fig. 6c). To assess the effect on the nuclear–cytoplasmic distribution of endogenous mRNAs, we performed 3′ end sequencing of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions after 8 h of CLK-IN-T3 treatment, which increased the nuclear retention of mRNAs with GA-rich GeRM regions in CDSs (Extended Data Fig. 10i). The extent of nuclear retention of each transcript was correlated between 8-h CLK inhibition and 12-h PPIGLCD expression (Extended Data Fig. 10k), indicating that both R-MCD abundance and CLK activity can modulate the retention of multivalent mRNAs in nuclear speckles.

We report the discovery of interstasis, a collective feedback loop mediated by a protein–RNA condensate that promotes the homeostasis of a broad range of condensation-prone proteins. Most of these are proteins that interact with RNA, DNA and chromatin, which tend to be enriched in IDRs across all domains of life45. Using a novel combinatorially assembled reporter strategy to study mRNA selectivity upon interstasis, we validated the importance of codon biases in the nuclear retention of multivalent mRNAs that encode condensation-prone proteins. Our findings suggest a model in which nuclear mRNA retention is promoted by multivalent assemblies of specific RBPs that localize to nuclear speckles, whereas EJC-dependent packaging counteracts such mRNA capture. We showed that upon increasing the dosage of condensation-prone proteins in speckles, TRA2B relocalizes to speckles, acting as a dosage effector that promotes the capture of multivalent mRNAs (Fig. 6d). By managing the most condensation-prone nuclear proteins that tend to localize into speckles, interstasis probably protects speckles from reaching the toxic levels of cohesion that could non-specifically capture mRNAs10. Thus, the properties of a condensate can serve as the long-sought mechanistic link between dosage sensing of IDR-containing proteins and dosage effectors that control their gene expression.

The multivalency of CDS regions encoding IDRs emerges partly due to the structure of the genetic code, that is, the high similarity of codons for biophysically similar amino acids, which tend to cluster within IDRs. Moreover, we found that codon biases further increase such RNA multivalency, especially in the transcriptomes of land vertebrates. All classes of multivalent CDS regions contain strong codon biases that reinforce multivalency, and each class is bound by specific RBPs and encodes IDRs within functionally coherent sets of proteins, indicating a broad potential for their co-regulation. Although autologous interaction between RBPs and their own mRNAs have been linked to affinities between amino acids and their cognate codons46,47, broad feedback regulation of a class of related IDRs and their mRNAs, or the role of codon biases in reinforcing such feedback have not been previously observed. Understanding how codon biases might enable feedback regulation between specific sets of proteins and their multivalent mRNAs has implications for various fields, such as interpreting the effect of synonymous mutations on human diseases48, and for the design of synonymous gene-recoded therapeutics49.

Nuclear retention of several spliced mRNAs has been identified in human tissues50, and phosphorylation of SR proteins has been shown to promote speckle mRNA retention; however, the selectivity of such retention remained unclear51. We found that the activity of CLK family kinases modulate selective speckle retention of highly multivalent, GA-rich mRNAs. Eight-hour inhibition of CLK kinases phenocopies the same selectivity of mRNA retention as the increased R-MCD expression, as it leads to hypophosphorylation of SR proteins such as TRA2B, which we found to be a key effector of the GA-rich mRNA sequestration into nuclear speckles. CLK signalling is responsive to various physiological states, including cell-cycle progression and small variations in temperature42,43, and is investigated as a therapeutic target for many diseases40, indicating a broad potential for altered signalling to modify the threshold of interstasis in specific cellular contexts.

The roles in the compartmentalization of biochemical reactions, such as the capacity of speckles to promote the efficiency of splicing, have been the focus of the functional studies of condensates27. It has been proposed that an additional function of endogenous condensates could be to buffer cellular noise due to their concentration-dependent assembly52, but it remained unclear how heterotypic interactions between diverse sets of proteins and RNAs could contribute to such buffering53. We now identify such a function for nuclear speckles, which serve as collective sensors of the combined dosage and modifications of co-condensing proteins. By capturing the mRNAs encoding these proteins, speckles promote the dosage homeostasis of proteins that are expressed from some of the most bidirectionally dosage-sensitive and mutationally constrained genes. It remains to be seen whether nuclear speckles thereby help to protect proteostasis during conditions that affect the relative concentrations of proteins in nucleoplasm, or in diseases with aberrant protein condensates, thereby complementing known pathways for protein quality control that primarily sense cytoplasmic disturbances54. Many age-related diseases, especially in neurodegeneration, involve aberrant protein–RNA condensates that can eventually promote aggregation of IDR-containing proteins4,55,56, and are often caused by low-complexity repeat expansions that can involve speckle recruitment of the repeat RNA57,58. Understanding the mechanisms that manage the homeostasis of proteins in condensates could open new therapeutic opportunities for these diseases55. In summary, we have demonstrated a new principle of a ‘collective autoregulatory protein–RNA circuit' controlled by the mesoscale properties of a condensate.

GeRM is calculated from a string of consecutive overlapping nucleotide sequences of length k (k-mers). From the set of n consecutive k-mers A, the GeRM score g of the central k-mer A0 is calculated as follows:

where B = −w,…,−k,k,…,w

where \(w=\frac{n+1}{2}\), the function d represents the Hamming distance, and λ represents a scaling constant.

In non-mathematical terms, the GeRM score is calculated by comparing a k-mer to all the other k-mers that surround it in a fixed window. For each of the surrounding k-mers, the sequence similarity to the central k-mer is calculated from the negative exponent of the Hamming distance, such that k-mers with identical sequences have a high score and those with unrelated sequences have a low score. The constant λ determines how quickly this similarity score decays as sequences become more dissimilar to the central k-mer. This sequence similarity score is multiplied by a distance score, which decays linearly from 1 to 0 with distance from the central k-mer. k-mers that overlap with the central k-mer are ignored. For k-mers at the edges of transcripts, where the window exceeds the end of the transcript, all positions that fall outside of the transcript are given a score of 0. The sum of all the distance-weighted sequence similarities is summed to give the GeRM score.

In this Article, we used a k-mer length (k) of 5, a window size (n) of 123 and a scaling factor (λ) of 1. We normalized the GeRM scores such that the minimum value in the transcriptome was 0 and the median was 1. Smoothing of GeRM scores was performed by taking the mean of values in a sliding window of size 123.

For the calculation of codon-shuffled multivalency, all codons for a given amino acid in each transcript were swapped such that the number of instances of each codon was preserved for each transcript, but their order was randomized. All GeRM scores for each transcript were calculated, and the mean GeRM score per position across ten shuffles was calculated.

The GeRM algorithm is available as an R package from GitHub (https://github.com/ulelab/germ).

For each protein-coding gene in GENCODE 29 or GENCODE M22, the transcript with the longest CDS was selected and ties were broken by the longest total transcript length. Only spliced transcripts were used for analysis. CDS GeRM regions were defined by taking all positions where the smoothed GeRM scores exceeded the 98th percentile of smoothed GeRM scores within the CDS, and GeRM regions were adjusted to contain all k-mers that fell within the smoothing window. GeRM regions with at least 41 nt of overlap were merged. GeRM regions for which at least one-third of the region fell within an untranslated region were excluded.

For each GeRM region, the relative proportion of the total multivalency of the region that was accounted for by each possible k-mer was calculated. For clustering, UMAP was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data to 4 dimensions, using 50 neighbours and a minimum distance of 0.001. The reduced data were clustered first using OPTICS with the minimum points defined by 1% of the total number of GeRM regions. The final clustering was performed with DBSCAN, yielding eight clusters. The reachability threshold for DBSCAN was defined by determining how the proportion of points below a given threshold changed as the reachability threshold decreased (from the 99th percentile to 0), then taking the point at which the first derivative was 40% of the maximum (the knee of the plot). GeRM regions falling outside of a cluster were excluded from further analysis. For presentation purposes, UMAP was used to reduce the original data to have two dimensions, with other parameters kept the same.

Codon shuffling was performed by shuffling the codons either within the entire transcriptome or within each transcript. Shuffling was performed five times, and GeRM scores were calculated from the shuffled sequences. The mean GeRM score per k-mer across the five shuffles was used for further analysis.

To generalize the scoring of identified multivalent types (that is, the GA-multivalency score and transcript multivalency), we summarized each GeRM cluster with the k-mers that contributed most to multivalency of regions in that cluster. The proportion of total multivalency accounted for by each 5-mer was calculated, and 5-mers were sorted in descending order based on this proportion. The cumulative sum was calculated, and all 5-mers that accounted for the first 50% of the multivalency in each GeRM cluster were selected as representative 5-mers for this multivalency type.

To define the complexity of amino acid sequences, information entropy was calculated using the R package HDMD in a sliding window of 41 amino acids along the translated CDSs from the set of transcripts used for GeRM scoring. LCDs were defined as regions with entropy in the bottom 2% of all entropy scores, with all amino acids in the sliding window being considered part of the LCD. LCDs that overlap were merged. AlphaFold59 predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) scores were obtained for the same set of proteins where available from UniProt.

To determine whether a given position in a sequence supported the local multivalency of that sequence, we defined a GeRM codon ratio. First, ‘mutable positions' were defined as any position that could be synonymously mutated. Primarily, these are the final position of the codon, but the first positions of some leucine and arginine codons can also be synonymously mutated. For each mutable position, sequences were produced in which every possible synonymous mutation was made. The GeRM scores of all 5-mers that overlapped with the mutable position were calculated, and the maximum of these GeRM scores was taken for each possible mutation or the native sequence. Then, the maximum GeRM score associated with the 5-mers overlapping the native sequence was divided by the mean of the maximum GeRM scores associated with all possible mutations to create a ratio. When this ratio is positive, the native nucleotide at the mutable position is associated with higher GeRM than the other possible mutations that could exist at that position on average.

PhyloP conservation across 100 vertebrates and 470 mammals in hg38 coordinates were downloaded from the UCSC Golden Path. These values were converted into transcriptomic coordinates based on the single transcripts per genes that were used for GeRM calculation. Mutable positions were binned based on their GeRM codon ratio with the binning calculations being applied to each codon separately, such that each bin contained an equal proportion of each codon.

For raw conservation analysis, the average PhyloP conservation values of mutable positions in each GeRm codon ratio bin were used. For analysis of normalized conservation values, the PhyloP of mutable positions were normalized for each codon by subtracting the median conservation of that mutable position in that codon by the median conservation across all mutable positions of the same type. For example, the conservation value associated with one instance of the A in the codon CGA would be normalized by subtracting the median conservation of all As in CGA codons. Each normalized position was then further normalized by subtracting the PhyloP value of the middle position of the codon (in the previous example, the G in that specific instance of the CGA codon). Subtraction was used for normalization because PhyloP scores operate on a logarithmic scale.

For analysis of arginine codon usage in R-LCDs, all human LCDs were filtered for those that obtain at least 20% arginine residues. The proportion of each arginine codon in the respective coding regions was calculated. Pairwise correlations between arginine codon usages using Spearman's rank correlation. To define CG-rich and GA-rich codon groups, principal component analysis was performed based on the arginine codon usage for all R-LCDs, and the top and bottom third of LCDs based on the first principal component were defined as CG-rich and GA-rich R-LCDs, respectively.

For the definition of R-LCDs in different species, all CDSs for each species were downloaded from Ensembl and a single transcript per gene was identified according to the previously described approach. LCDs encoded by these sequences were defined as previously described, using the complexity threshold defined for the human proteome for each species. A full list of the species and annotation versions can be found in Supplementary Table 1.

Gene Ontology analyses were conducted using the topGO R package and using the weight01 algorithm to account for the topology of the Gene Ontology graph.

HeLa cells were obtained from Cell Science at The Francis Crick Institute and cultured in DMEM + GlutaMAX (Thermo Scientific) with 10% FBS and split every 3–4 days using TrypLE Express (Thermo Scientific). Low-passage, wild-type mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs; 129S8/B6 background) were obtained from the Genetic Modification Service at The Francis Crick Institute and cultured feeder free on Nunc cell culture dishes (Thermo Scientific) coated with 0.1% gelatin (ES-006-B, Millipore). mESCs were maintained in 2i media60, fed every day and split every 2–3 days using Accutase (A6964, Sigma). All cell lines were sourced from, authenticated by and mycoplasma tested at The Francis Crick Institute.

All cell transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer's instructions. Doxycycline induction was performed by changing cell culture media to fresh, pre-warmed media containing 100 ng ml−1 doxycycline. CLK-IN-T3 (SML2649, Sigma) was dissolved to 5 mM in DMSO. In experiments using CLK-IN-T3 treatments, control cells were treated with the equivalent volume of DMSO.

Double-stranded DNA fragments were ordered as gBlocks or eBlocks from IDT. Primers were ordered from Sigma-Aldrich. All PCRs utilized Q5 High-Fidelity Master Mix (NEB) or Phusion High-Fidelity Master Mix (NEB). Backbone plasmids were linearized via PCR followed by treatment with DpnI (NEB) before assembly with fragments using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly (NEB) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Phosphorylations and ligations were performed using T4 PNK kinase (NEB) and T4 DNA ligase (NEB). Assembly reactions were purified using magnetic SPRI beads (Mag-bind TotalPure NGS; Omega-Bio-tek) before DNA transformation into 5α competent Escherichia coli (NEB). All sequences were confirmed via Sanger sequencing (Source Bioscience). pTwist-AMP high-copy plasmid was purchased from Twist Bioscience and was used as a vector for all overexpression via transient transfection. Sequences of all LUC7L3 constructs can be found in Supplementary Table 5.

For the three additional R-MCD plasmids, the following regions of LUC7L3221–415, PRPF38B251–534 and SRSF11171–389 were fused to mGreenLantern and assembled into pTwist-CMV plasmid backbones.

Nuclear–cytoplasmic fractionation was carried out by trypsinizing whole cells and washing twice with PBS. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 200 µl cytoplasmic lysis buffer: 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.025% NP-40, 0.05% saponin and 1X cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Sigma). Cells were rotated at 4 °C for 10 min, pelleted and the supernatant was taken as the cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclear pellet was washed in 1 ml cytoplasmic lysis buffer for 3 min, then pelleted again. The supernatant was removed and the nuclei were lysed in 200 µl iCLIP lysis buffer61 to obtain nuclear fractions. All centrifugations were performed at 4 °C and at 300g for 3 min. All buffers were kept ice cold. For each fraction, 20 µl was used for western blotting to confirm the efficiency of the fractionation, which was stable across all samples (Extended Data Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 3). In all western blots, vinculin was used as a loading control (1:2,000; 700062, Thermo Scientific). Anti-phosphoepitope SR proteins (1:1,000; MABE50, Sigma) were used to detect SR phosphorylation changes.

RNA extractions were performed from cell pellets using the Maxwell RSC simplyRNA kit (Promega) using a Maxwell RSC Instrument (Promega).

For each sample, 250 ng µl−1 of RNA was fragmented in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 10 mM MgCl2 buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. Of fragmented RNA, 2 µl was mixed with 2 µl water, 0.5 µl of 10 mM dNTPs and 0.5 µl of 5 µM of oligo-dT reverse transcription primers containing Illumina P7 sequences, and primers were annealed by heating at 65 °C for 3 min then cooling to 42 °C at 1 °C per second. At this point, reverse transcription was carried out using SuperScript IV (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions, with the addition of 0.25 µl of 40 µM of a template-switching oligo containing Illumina P5 sequences and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). The reaction was incubated for 1 h at 42 °C. Following alkaline hydrolysis of RNA, the product was purified using magnetic SPRI beads and amplified using 0.5 µM i5/i7 Illumina indexed primers in Q5 High-Fidelity Master Mix (NEB).

All sequencing data were mapped to the GRCh38.p12 genome using the GENCODE v29 basic genome annotation. All 3′ end sequencing data were trimmed using cutadapt (v4.4)62 to remove poly-A sequences and Illumina adapters. All data were processed using the nf-core RNA-seq Nextflow pipeline (v3.12.0)63, and in the case of the 3′ end sequencing data, the additional option --noLengthCorrection was provided to Salmon to prevent length correction for gene expression.

Differential expression analysis was conducted using DESeq2 in R64, with effect size shrinkage using the apeglm package65. Changes in the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio between two conditions were assessed using the interaction term of the models (fraction × time). Splicing analysis was conducted using rMATS (v4.1.2)66 using the skipped exons calculated using the JCEC quantifications.

To classify genes based on their degree of GA multivalency, a GA-multivalency score was calculated for each gene based on the CDS of its primary transcript, defined by the longest annotated CDS, with ties settled by total transcript length. First, for each of the three previously identified GA-rich GeRM clusters (A-rich and G-rich AG, AG + C), representative k-mers were derived as described in the section ‘Identification and classification of GeRM regions'. Then, raw multivalency scores of 5-mers were scaled to all other instances of the same 5-mer, such that their mean score was 0 and their standard deviation was 1. For each transcript, the sum of all these scaled GeRM scores was summed across all representative 5-mers. On the basis of this metric, transcripts that have many instances of GA-rich 5-mers specifically in multivalent contexts are rewarded. All processed data from 3′ end sequencing experiments can be found in Supplementary Table 4.

Cells were grown for 48 h in lysine-free and arginine-free DMEM (Thermo Scientific), supplemented with 10% dialysed FBS (Thermo Scientific), 600 mg l−1 proline and 100 mg l−1 arginine and lysine (‘light' media). Cells were induced with 500 ng ml−1 doxycycline for 12 h before switching to either medium arginine 13C6 (88210, Thermo Scientific) and lysine 4,4,5,5-D4 (DLM-2640, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories; ‘medium' media) or heavy arginine 13C6 15N4 (89990, Thermo Scientific) and lysine 13C6 15N2 (88209, Thermo Scientific; ‘heavy' media) for 8 h. Media were refreshed every 2 h, with doxycycline treatment maintained throughout.

Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 4% SDS, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma). Samples were next sonicated, and their protein concentrations quantified via DC protein assay (Bio-Rad).

Lysates were reduced by the addition of dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 5 mM, vortexed briefly and incubated at 56 °C for 30 min. Samples were cooled to room temperature and alkylated with iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 20 mM. Following brief vortexing and incubation in the dark at room temperature for 20 min, residual iodoacetamide was quenched with 5 mM dithiothreitol for 10 min. Trypsin was added at a 1:100 enzyme:substrate ratio. Samples were vortexed, centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 rpm and incubated overnight at 37 °C shaking at 750 rpm.

Peptide samples (1 µg on column) were analysed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). Chromatographic separation was performed using the U3000 UHPLC NanoLC system (Thermo Scientific) and peptides were resolved by reversed phase chromatography on a 75-µm C18 Pepmap column (50 cm length) via a three-step linear gradient comprising 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. The gradient was delivered to elute peptides at a flow rate of 250 nl min−1 over 120 min, initially at 4% solvent at 0–10 min, then increasing to 30% solvent (10–75 min) and 40% solvent at 75–80 min. This was followed by a wash step with 99% solvent (85–90 min) and a final equilibration step with 4% solvent (90–120 min).

Peptides were ionized by electrospray via an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) operating under Xcalibur (v4.3). Data were acquired in data-dependent acquisition mode using an Orbitrap-Ion Trap method with a 3-s cycle time between a full MS scan and MS/MS fragmentation by collision-induced dissociation. Orbitrap spectra were collected at 120,000 resolution over an m/z range of 350–1,600, with an automatic gain control of 4.0 × 105 (100%) and maximum injection time of 35 ms. Monoisotropic precursor selection was enabled for charge states +2 to +5 with an intensity threshold of 5 × 103–1 × 1020 and dynamic exclusion of 35 s ± 10 ppm. MS2 precursor ions were isolated in the quadrupole with a mass width filter of 1.6 m/z. Ion trap fragmentation spectra were collected with an automatic gain control target setting of 1.0 × 104 (100%) with a maximum injection time of 35 ms with collision-induced dissociation collision energy set at 35%.

Raw mass spectrometry data were processed into peak list files using Proteome Discoverer (v3.1; Thermo Scientific) and searched with the Sequest algorithm67 against the Uniprot Human isoform database (188,476 entries; September 2024). This was concatenated with the mScarlet fluorescent protein sequence. Database searching was performed at a stringency of 1% FDR including a decoy search with precursor ion intensity quantification. Post-translational modifications to amino acid residues included carbamidomethylation (C) and variable oxidation (M), SILAC 13C6 (R) and SILAC 2H42 (K).

The proportion of SILAC-labelled peptides for each protein was compared between doxycycline-treated and untreated samples to determine the change in translation or protein turnover. The mean log2 fold change for all proteins belonging to different multivalency classes in each replicate was calculated and this per-replicate mean was used for pairwise significance testing. The proportion of the total proteome or total R-MCD abundance attributed to mScarlet–PPIGLCD overexpression was calculated using the peptides assigned to mScarlet, and R-MCDs were classified as previously defined R-LCDs (those containing at least 20% arginine), with the additional constraint that the net charge must be positive and the total fraction of charged residues in the LCD must be greater than 40%.

Immunofluorescence was performed by fixing cells in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glyoxal at room temperature for 10 min. Samples were permeabilized by incubating with PBS with 0.5% Triton-X for 5 min at room temperature. Samples were blocked using PBS with 3% BSA and 0.1% Tween (blocking solution). Primary antibody incubations were carried out in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Samples were washed three times with PBS with 0.1% Tween for 5 min, and secondary antibody incubations were carried out in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Samples were washed twice, then incubated with 200 ng ml−1 DAPI for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. DAPI was washed out and samples were placed in glycerol mounting medium (90% glycerol, 20 mM Tris pH 8 and PBS).

The following antibodies were used at the following concentrations: rabbit anti-TRA2B (1:1,000; ab31353, abcam), rabbit anti-SON (1:1,000; HPA023535, Sigma) and mouse anti-SC35 (1:500; S4045, Sigma). Secondary antibodies to mouse and rabbit, conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 647 were used at 1:500 dilution (Abcam). This included goat pAb anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 647 (ab150079), goat pAb anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (ab150077), goat pAb anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (ab150113) and goat pAb anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 647 (ab150115).

For each mRNA, HCR 12 probe pairs were designed with the B4 amplifier sequences using the HCR 3.0 Probe Maker68. HCR 3.0 was performed on cells in µ-Slide eight-well glass bottom slides (80827, Ibidi) as described in the original protocol69, with the following modifications. First, fixation and permeabilization was performed as described in the immunofluorescence section. After pre-hybridization, primary probe hybridization was performed with a probe concentration of 10 nM for 3 h. Overnight HCR amplification was performed in a volume of 125 µl with half the concentration of HCR hairpins (Molecular Instruments). Following HCR amplification, samples were washed according to the original protocol, and then immunofluorescence was performed as previously described, but with all buffers containing 2XSSC in place of PBS.

In all cases of R-MCD overexpression transfections, HCR-FISH was performed on HeLa cells 24 h post-transfection with 50 ng of mGreenLantern-fused R-MCD plasmid, in combination with 200 ng of pUC19 filler DNA.

Samples for oligo-d(T) FISH were fixed as described for immunofluorescence. Samples were incubated with HCR 3.0 hybridization buffer for 30 min at 37 °C, then in hybridization buffer containing 1 µg ml−1 oligo-dT(25)-Cy5 for 2 h. Samples were washed twice in 5XSSC with 0.1% Tween, stained with 200 ng ml−1 DAPI in the same buffer and washed once more before glycerol mounting medium was added.

Microscope images were acquired using an Olympus IX3 Series (IX83) inverted microscope, equipped with a Yokogawa W1 spinning disk and a Hamamatsu Orca Fusion CMOS camera (pixel size of 6.5 μm, 2,304 × 2304, 5.3 megapixels).

All images were z-projected using a maximum projection. Segmentation of nuclei and cytoplasms was performed using Cellpose (v2.0)70 using the cyto2 model. Segmentation of nuclear speckles was performed using CellProfiler using the Otsu thresholding algorithm, and nucleoplasms were considered all non-speckle regions of the nucleus. The mean signal intensity for HCR-FISH or immunofluorescence within speckles was compared with the mean intensity in the nucleoplasm for each cell to create a speckle enrichment ratio. Mean intensities in the nucleoplasm and nuclear speckle were calculated per cell, but statistical comparisons between groups counted each replicate as a single observation, taking the mean values across all cells in the replicate.

Using predictive modelling, we aimed to evaluate the contribution of CDS length, EJC density and different types of multivalent features on nuclear retention of endogenous transcripts in interstasis. To disentangle the contributions of the different multivalent features, we first cleaned the data to reduce collinearities. Representative k-mers were assigned for each of the eight GeRM clusters as described in the section ‘Identification and classification of GeRM regions'. Subsequently, k-mers belonging to multiple clusters were retained only in the cluster to which they contributed the highest proportion of multivalency, ensuring no k-mers overlapped between clusters.

Next, the raw k-mer multivalencies for all k-mers belonging to a cluster were summed across CDSs of representative transcripts, defined as the transcript with the longest CDS per gene, and normalized by CDS length. These length-normalized multivalency sums were then standard scaled across the transcriptome so that the mean transcriptome-wide multivalency of each GeRM cluster was zero. We assessed the correlations between the multivalencies of the eight GeRM clusters and found a high correlation among the C-rich, CUG-repeat, G-rich, G/C and GA + C multivalent classes. Given this high correlation and the similarity of their k-mers, we combined these clusters into a single GC-rich cluster for training. We repeated the scoring with the combined k-mers from all these clusters. This approach efficiently minimized collinearities between features, except for a moderate anti-correlation (Spearman's r = −0.75) between the GC-rich and A-rich clusters. Features used for training are summarized in Supplementary Table 8.

Then, we trained a classification model to differentiate between mRNAs retained in the nucleus after PPIGLCD induction and control mRNAs that did not show a significant change in their nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio under these conditions. mRNAs were classified as retained if they had a q < 0.05 and a log2 fold change greater than 1 at 12 h post-PPIGLCD induction, resulting in 275 transcripts. Control mRNAs were defined by a q ≥ 0.05 and a log2 fold change between −0.1 and 0.1, yielding 1,697 transcripts.

Owing to significant imbalance between the positive (nuclear retained) and the negative (control) class, we used a BalancedRandomForestClassifier from imbalanced-learn module (v0.12.3)71, leveraging sampling of the majority class to balance the classes in the process of training (sampling_strategy = ‘not minority'). The classifier was configured with 100 trees (n_estimators = 100) and used bootstrap sampling with replacement to enhance generalization. Gini impurity criterion was used for node splitting and the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node was set to 15. For evaluation of the classifier's performance, we used fourfold stratified cross-validation. This method splits the data into fourfolds, with each fold serving as a test set once while the remaining threefolds serve as the training set. Stratified k-fold cross-validation ensures that each of the folds maintains the same proportion of positive and negative samples as the entire dataset, thereby preventing skewed performance metrics. In this case, the model was trained four times, with each training set comprising 75% of the data and each test set comprising 25%, ensuring balanced class representation in both training and testing. Visualized AUROC metrics were averaged across folds to obtain a robust estimate of the classifier's performance.

To identify the optimal set of input features and assess their effect on predictive performance, we used a stepwise feature-selection approach. Initially, we trained models with individual features and progressively expanded the feature set, by selecting the best-performing single feature or feature combination and adding the remaining features on top of it. This process was repeated until adding more features no longer enhanced the performance of the model. All models were evaluated using fourfold cross-validation, as described.

The mScarlet–PPIGLCD library was designed by concatenating the CDSs for mScarlet and PPIG402–684. The concatenated sequence was then iteratively synonymously mutated such that the GC content of the sequence was maintained within 2% of the original sequence, choosing codons with fewer As and Gs until the number of AG-only 5-mers reached a minimum. Untranslated regions were added to this sequence. Seven equally spaced sequences of 28 nt were chosen along the sequence to be used as overlap sequences for future Gibson assembly. These overlap sequences were protected from future in silico mutagenesis.

Twenty-six constitutively spliced introns ranging from 83 nt to 384 nt in length were selected from housekeeping genes. We generated 25 different combinations by randomly choosing 8 of these introns, then performed the following iterative optimization algorithm to each of these 25 combinations to generate sequences with optimized predicted splicing.

First, introns were inserted in the reporter CDS in positions that were exactly between the previously defined overlap sequences or the start and end codons. The probability of donor and acceptor site usage was predicted using SpliceAI, and all probabilities were summed. Next, 100 coding sequences with 5 random synonymous mutations were generated, and a sequence was selected that best maintained GC content and kept GA 5-mer content low. After this, an intronic sequence was selected with a 80% chance to be mutated at 5% of its positions and a 50% chance to be shifted by up to 20 nt. The probability of donor and acceptor site usage in the new sequence was predicted with SpliceAI, and the sum of the probabilities was compared with the previous sequence. If the total probability of splice site usage was increased in the mutated sequence, then the mutated sequence was put forwards for another round of mutation, until 2,000 iterations were completed.

To create a GA-rich version of the reporter CDS, the iterative process was repeated, but with synonymous mutations that maintained GC content but maximized GA-rich 5-mer content. The sequence and position of the introns were kept constant for this process.

To determine which of the 25 possible combinations of 8 introns resulted in the best-predicted splicing in both GA-poor and GA-rich reporter sequences, we selected the intron set with the highest summed probability of predicted donor and acceptor site usage. This resulted in GA-poor and GA-rich codon-biased reporter sequences in which both splice sites for each of the eight introns was predicted to have at least a 98.5% probability of being spliced.

For both the GA-rich and the GA-poor sequence, eight sequence segments were generated that spanned from each overlap sequence to the next (or to the untranslated region) and that either contained an intronic sequence or not. Therefore, each of the eight segments of the final reporter gene varied in two possible ways: GA richness and the presence or absence of an intron, and each of these variable segments shared a fixed overlap sequence with the neighbouring segment.

All 32 possible segment variations were ordered as double-stranded DNA fragments from IDT. In addition to the overlap sequences that would be part of the final reporter transcript, additional overlap sequences were added for intermediate assembly steps. Specifically, an overlap sequence was added to the 3′ end of the first segment and to the 5′ of the last segment, and another overlap sequence was added to the 3′ ends of the first and fifth segments and the 5′ ends of the fourth and last segment. Then, two pools containing all variations of the first four segments or all variations of the last four segments were made, such that intron-containing variants had twice the molarity of intronless variants at each position, but all positions had the same overall molarity. A Gibson assembly reaction was carried out on each pool, and due to the additional overlaps on the first, fourth, fifth and final segments, circular pieces of double-stranded DNA were formed, each containing one of the four variations at each of the four positions used for that pool.

These circular pieces of DNA were then linearized and amplified by PCR, and the linearized fragments deriving from the first and second half of the reporter gene were again Gibson assembled together. Again, because of the additional overlap sequences attached to the first and last segments, the resulting assemblies were circular. Each assembly contained a 5′ UTR, a CDS encoding mScarlet–PPIGLCD but with a variable amount of GA-rich 5-mers and a variable number of introns, and a 3′ UTR. These assemblies were then linearized and amplified by PCR and Gibson assembled into a plasmid backbone (pTwist-CMV) containing a CMV promoter and a barcoded 3′ UTR sequence with a poly-adenylation site. Therefore, the plasmids in the pool contained different versions of the reporter gene, each with a unique barcode in their 3′ UTR.

After each reaction, the product was purified using Mag-Bind TotalPure beads. All PCRs were performed using Q5 High-Fidelity Master Mix (NEB). All Gibson assemblies were performed using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly (NEB).

To generate a doxycycline-inducible PiggyBac integration vector containing the reporter library (ePB-ExportReporter), reporter genes and their barcoded UTRs were amplified out of the original reporter plasmid library with a low number of PCR cycles, before being inserted into an all-in-one PiggyBac plasmid (ePB-Bsd-TT-NIL) containing a doxycycline-inducible promoter as well as a constitutive promoter driving the expression of the rtTA protein and blasticidin resistance gene. All designed fragments, as well as example reporter sequences and plasmids, are provided in Supplementary Table 2.

For sequencing of the plasmid pool, the reporter genes were amplified from the plasmid DNA with a minimal number of PCR cycles. For sequencing of the reporter RNA, one well of a six-well plate of HeLa cells were transfected with 500 ng of the reporter plasmid pool and 2,000 ng of a filler pUC19 plasmid for 16 h. RNA was extracted and 500 ng of total RNA was used as input for a SuperScript IV reverse transcription (Invitrogen) reaction using an oligo-dT reverse transcription following the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction was purified with magnetic beads, then amplified according to the same approach as for the plasmid DNA. The specificity of the amplicon was confirmed with an agarose gel. In both cases, the PCR product was purified with magnetic beads (Mag-bind TotalPure NGS, Omega-Bio-tek) and Nanopore adapters were added using the Nanopore Ligation Sequencing Kit (Oxford Nanopore), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The libraries were sequenced separately using MinION R9.4.1 Flow Cells (Oxford Nanopore).

Raw Nanopore data were basecalled with Guppy (v6.0.1). The basecalled reads were mapped to a genome of possible reporter transcripts using minimap2 (ref. 72), and barcodes were extracted by matching the upstream and downstream sequences using the R package stringdist73.

Targeted sequencing libraries were prepared from 500 ng of RNA input per sample. A targeted reverse transcription was performed with SuperScript IV (Invitrogen) using a reverse transcription primer that was specific to the reporter 3′ UTR and contained a 4-nt experimental barcode, a 10-nt UMI and an Illumina p7 adapter sequence. The reaction was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Samples were multiplexed in groups of six at this point, and the RNA was removed by alkaline hydrolysis for 15 min, the pH was neutralized with hydrochloric acid, and the cDNA was purified with magnetic beads. A nested PCR was then performed in which ten cycles with one set of primers was performed. Of the reaction, 5% was spiked into the next six-cycle reaction, in which an Illumina p5 adapter sequence was added. The PCR was purified with magnetic beads (Mag-bind TotalPure NGS, Omega-Bio-tek), and Illumina i5 and i7 indices were added by a final PCR. Libraries were sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 by the Advanced Sequencing Facility at The Francis Crick Institute. All primer sequences can be found in Supplementary Table 2.

Targeted sequencing libraries were analysed in R. Libraries were demultiplexed using the barcodes introduced by the reverse transcription primer, and the plasmid barcode was extracted by matching the flanking constant regions using fuzzy string matching using the R package stringdist. Reads containing the same barcode were deduplicated by their UMI sequences. Barcodes were counted and related to their reporter gene characteristics based on the long-read sequencing data. Barcode counts were normalized to the total number of assigned barcodes for each sample. Barcodes with low numbers of counts were excluded from further analysis. Nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios for each barcode were calculated for each replicate. All processed data for each experiment can be found in Supplementary Table 3.

We cloned the reporter pool into a doxycycline-inducible PiggyBac vector and generated the PiggyBac cell lines by co-transfecting HeLa cells with equal amounts of the ePB-ExportReporter plasmid pool and a plasmid expressing the PiggyBac transposase. A transposase-negative control was also prepared. Cells were selected once with 5 µg ml−1 blasticidin for 4 days, then expanded for 1 week, before being selected again with blasticidin until all cells in the transposase-negative control were dead. This pool of ePB-ExportReporter-positive cells was then expanded and stocks were frozen.

To understand which RBPs have the potential to bind to GA-multivalent reporters with high affinity, we designed a ‘binding potential' score, based on RBP-binding motifs obtained with the RNA-Bind-N-Seq method. We downloaded enrichment scores (R scores) for 78 RBPs published by Dominguez et al.30, and for TRA2B32 from the ENCODE portal, yielding motifs for 79 distinct RBPs. Accession codes and relevant concentrations of RNA-Bind-N-Seq experiments are specified in the supplementary material of the original publication (see supplementary table 3 in ref. 30). The R scores for the RBP concentration that yielded the highest motif enrichment were converted to z scores using mean and standard deviation. A tail test was then applied to compute P values, and motifs with a P < 0.05 were selected for further analysis.

To evaluate the reporter sequences in terms of RBP-binding potential, we divided their CDSs into 5-mers using a rolling window of 5 nt. We then counted the 5-mers that were labelled as significant for a given RBP and multiplied the count for each significant 5-mer by its z score. The values obtained were summed into a single score for each RBP (Fig. 5h). The binding potential scores for all evaluated RBPs and reporter sequences can be found in Supplementary Table 9.

All public CLIP data were processed as previously described74, with replicates merged. All crosslinks falling within CDS per sample were counted and the proportion of CDSs to total crosslinks was calculated. Samples in the bottom third were excluded. Remaining samples in the bottom third of raw CDS crosslink counts were also excluded, to remove low-quality datasets. To determine whether a protein tends to bind to RNA in multivalent contexts, the percentile of the GeRM score was calculated for each possible 5-mer in all CDSs. For each crosslink in each sample, the mean GeRM percentile of each crosslinked 5-mer was calculated. If a given 5-mer is crosslinked preferentially in multivalent contexts (relative to the average multivalency of that 5-mer), then the mean GeRM percentile will be high. The mean 5-mer GeRM percentiles for the top 50 most crosslinked 5-mers was compared with all other 5-mers, producing a ratio. This ratio represents the general bias of a protein to bind its preferred motifs in a multivalent context. In the examples shown in Extended Data Fig. 8i,j, this ratio is the mean y axis position for the 50 right-most points on the x axis over the mean y axis position of all other points. Only samples with a ratio of at least 1.1, implying a preference for multivalent motifs, were kept for further analysis.

Only transcripts in the top half of total crosslinks per nucleotide in the CDS across all samples were used for further analysis, as samples with a low crosslinking density typically did not contain enough crosslinks per GeRM region to produce meaningful results. For each GeRM region, the ratio of the number of crosslinks falling within that GeRM region compared with the rest of the CDS for that transcript was calculated. The mean of this ratio within each GeRM cluster was calculated for each sample. Samples were then hierarchically clustered and plotted as a heatmap (Fig. 5a).

iCLIP was performed according to the iiCLIP protocol61, using crosslinked cell lysate containing 1.5 mg of protein per sample. Two replicates were prepared for each CLIP target. For immunoprecipitation, 5 µg anti-TRA2B (ab31353, abcam) was used. Membrane transfer was performed overnight at 4 °C with reduced voltage (15 V). The entire lane was cut from 40 kDa upwards.

CLIP libraries were trimmed and demultiplexed using Ultraplex75 and mapped to a small RNA genome containing all rRNA, small nuclear RNA, tRNA and small nucleolar RNA sequences from GENCODE vM22 using STAR (v2.7.0)76. All unmapped reads were then mapped uniquely to the genome using STAR, with the transcriptome-mapping reads output using the flag --quantMode TranscriptomeSAM, and the 5′ end of the read was forced to be aligned using the flag --alignEndsType Extend5pOfRead1. Reads were demultiplexed using UMItools77. Crosslink sites were defined as the position immediately upstream of the read.

Metaprofiles around different GeRM regions were created by taking the midpoint of each GeRM region and counting the transcriptome-mapped crosslinks in each position relative to the midpoint. All counts were summed across GeRM regions of the same cluster, then normalized by the number of GeRM regions within the cluster and the number of millions of unique transcriptome-mapping crosslinks in each sample.

For siRNA-induced double TRA2 knockdowns, 100 nM of ON-TARGETplus siRNA pools, consisting of four siRNAs targeting both TRA2A (LQ-019480-00-0005, Dharmacon) and TRA2B (LQ-007278-00-0005, Dharmacon), were transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer's reverse transfection protocol. Transfections with a 100 nM scrambled non-targeting control pool (D-001810-10-05, Dharmacon) were carried out in parallel. Thirty-six hours after transfection, doxycycline was added to the transfection media to induce mScarlet–PPIGLCD expression over a period of 12 h. A total of 48 h post-transfection, cells were either fixed for HCR-FISH as previously described or collected for western blotting to confirm efficient knockdown of TRA2A (1:500; H00029896-B01P, Novus Biologicals) and TRA2B. This was quantified via ImageStudio 5.x Odyssey Clx (LI-COR).

For each sample, a single well of a six-well plate of ePB-ER HeLa cells was transfected with one of the mGreenLantern LUC7L3-LCD reporter plasmids in which the LUC7L3 sequence was used as a 3′ UTR but was either GA rich or GA poor. Doxycycline was added to the medium at the point of transfection. Four replicates were performed for each plasmid, as well as untransfected and uninduced controls. After 16 h, the cells were dissociated, washed twice with ice-cold PBS and kept on ice while the samples were measured with an LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences). The intensities of mGreenLantern and mScarlet were measured using a 488-nm blue laser (Coherent Sapphire 100 mW) with a 530/30-nm filter, and a 561-nm yellow green laser (Coherent Sapphire 100 mW) with a 610/20-nm filter, respectively.

Gating of singlets was performed using FlowJo, and subsequent analysis was performed in R. For each plasmid, the mGreenLantern intensities were normalized to the mean intensity values of the uninduced control samples. Cells were binned according to their mScarlet intensity values, and the mean mGreenLantern intensity values for all cells in each bin were calculated per replicate.

All statistics were performed in R (v4.2.0). All tests were two-tailed when possible. All pairwise comparisons were made using a Welch t-test unless otherwise stated. When appropriate, P values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure.

a, An example of a transcript from the gene CCDC61. The smoothed GeRM score is shown along the transcript in the upper panel (solid line), with the dashed line depicting the average smoothed GeRM score after synonymous codon shuffling. The amino acid entropy of the encoded sequence is shown in the lower panel (black line), while the proportion of charged amino acids in that window is shown in the orange line. b, The native DNA and amino acid sequences of CCDC61 within the GeRM peak. A codon shuffled sequence in which all codons must be synonymously shifted is shown. The conservation across 100 vertebrates (PhyloP) for each position that can tolerate synonymous mutation is shown, with the height of the letter corresponding to the PhyloP score. Below, a ratio is shown that compares the GeRM scores associated with the native codon choice to the GeRM scores associated with any possible synonymous mutation. c, a schematic detailing the calculation of the ratio of GeRM between native codon choices and synonymous mutations. d, the mean log2-transformed ratio for each type of possible synonymous mutation. For example, for the arginine codon CGG, position 1 is considered a synonymously mutable position (CGG -> AGG) and position 3 is considered separately as a mutable position (e.g CGG -> CGC). Relative codon usage is calculated by scaling the transcriptomic codon usage such that the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. e, The normalised conservation across 470 mammals of synonymously mutable positions in coding sequences that either encode LCDs or do not. Codons are binned by the degree that the native codon choice supports sequence multivalency, where codons with the highest ratio support the multivalency the most. Conservation values are normalised to the middle position of the codon, which is never synonymously mutable, and each codon is normalised to have a median conservation value of 0. f, PhyloP scores across 100 vertebrates of the middle positions of codons inside or outside of LCDs. g, As in Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 1e, but using unnormalised PhyloP scores across 100 vertebrates. h, The mean GeRM scores within CDS regions encoding LCDs (black lines), or the rest of the CDS (grey lines). The mean GeRM scores in those regions after synonymously reordering the codons within each transcript (dashed lines) Unless otherwise stated, pairwise significance testing are FDR-corrected Welch t-tests, where * = p < 1−15. Precise p-values are found in Source Data.

Only amino acids with notable enrichments are shown. c, The number of GeRM regions per cluster encoding at least two-fold more arginines than expected based on occurrence in the proteome. d, The mean amino acid entropy calculated in sliding windows for amino acids encoded by different GeRM regions or the amino acid sequences encoded by the rest of the CDS (grey line). The dashed line represents the mean amino acid entropy for the entire proteome. Statistical comparisons are Welch t-tests between the GeRM regions and the non-GeRM regions from the same set of proteins, with FDR correction. e, The log2-transformed ratio between the total GeRM calculated from the native sequence within a GeRM region and the mean total GeRM score in the same region when codons have been synonymously shuffled five times within each transcript. Statistical tests are one sample t-tests, with FDR correction.

Optical tweezer arrays 1,2 have transformed atomic and molecular physics, now forming the backbone for a range of leading experiments in quantum computing 3–8, simulation 1,9–12, and metrology 13–15. Typical experiments trap tens to hundreds of atomic qubits, and recently systems with around one thousand atoms were realized without defining qubits or demonstrating coherent control 16–18. However, scaling to thousands of atomic qubits with long coherence times, low-loss, and high-fidelity imaging is an outstanding challenge and critical for progress in quantum science, particularly towards quantum error correction 19,20. Here, we experimentally realize an array of optical tweezers trapping over 6,100 neutral atoms in around 12,000 sites, simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art performance for several metrics that underpin the success of the platform. Specifically, while scaling to such a large number of atoms, we demonstrate a coherence time of 12.6(1) seconds, a record for hyperfine qubits in an optical tweezer array. We show room-temperature trapping lifetimes of  ~ 23 minutes, enabling record-high imaging survival of 99.98952(1)% with an imaging fidelity of over 99.99%. We present a plan for zone-based quantum computing 5,21 and demonstrate necessary coherence-preserving qubit transport and pick-up/drop-off operations on large spatial scales, characterized through interleaved randomized benchmarking. Our results, along with recent developments 8,22–24, indicate that universal quantum computing and quantum error correction with thousands to tens of thousands of physical qubits could be a near-term prospect.

YouTube will finally allow you to hide the pop-up recommendations that appear at the end of videos, the company announced on Wednesday. Now when you see an end screen, you can tap a new “Hide” button in the top-right corner of the video player to hide the pop-ups from the current video you're watching.

Selecting this button will only hide end screens for the current video you're watching, not for all videos on the platform, the company notes. If you want to bring the end screen back, you can tap the Show button.

The decision to let users hide end screens is a welcome addition to the platform, especially since they can end up covering the last bit of a video and make it hard to see what's happening in some cases.

The company also announced that it's removing the Subscribe button that appears when you hover your cursor over a video's branded watermark. YouTube explains that it's doing so because there's already a Subscribe button directly below the video player.

YouTube says it's launching the new features in response to user feedback, as many people said they wanted the option to minimize distractions on videos and for it to be easier to focus on the content they're currently watching. 

As for creators, YouTube notes that they still have the option to add end screens to videos. The company expects these changes to have a minimal impact on creators' performance and view count on the platform. 

For instance, YouTube found in an experiment that giving users the option to hide end screens resulted in a less than 1.5% decrease in views from end screens. Plus, it found that less than ~0.05% of all Channel subscriptions come from the hover-to-subscribe functionality on the video watermark.

Microsoft is leaning into its new partnership with OpenAI's chief rival, Anthropic. Starting Wednesday, the software giant will incorporate Anthropic's AI models into its AI assistant Copilot, which has previously been fueled mainly by OpenAI.  

The deal signals yet another step toward the slow disentangling between the erstwhile exclusive partners, and comes a couple of weeks after Microsoft inked a deal to use Anthropic's AI in Office 365 apps like Word, Excel, and Outlook.  

Copilot business users will be able to choose between OpenAI's deep reasoning models and Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4 for help with certain tasks, like complex researching and help building custom AI tools and enterprise-grade agents. Opus 4.1 is designed for complex reasoning, coding, and deep architecture planning, whereas Sonnet 4 is better for routine development tasks, large-scale data processing, and content generation.

MIT Technology Review's highly subjective take on the latest buzz about AI

Separating AI reality from hyped-up fiction isn't always easy. That's why we've created the AI Hype Index—a simple, at-a-glance summary of everything you need to know about the state of the industry.

Millions of us use chatbots every day, even though we don't really know how they work or how using them affects us. In a bid to address this, the FTC recently launched an inquiry into how chatbots affect children and teenagers. Elsewhere, OpenAI has started to shed more light on what people are actually using ChatGPT for, and why it thinks its LLMs are so prone to making stuff up.

There's still plenty we don't know—but that isn't stopping governments from forging ahead with AI projects. In the US, RFK Jr. is pushing his staffers to use ChatGPT, while Albania is using a chatbot for public contract procurement. Proceed with caution. 

It's the most transparent estimate yet from one of the big AI companies, and a long-awaited peek behind the curtain for researchers.

An exclusive conversation with Mark Chen and Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI's twin heads of research, about the path toward more capable reasoning models—and superalignment.

Some therapists are using AI during therapy sessions. They're risking their clients' trust and privacy in the process. 

The much-hyped release makes several enhancements to the ChatGPT user experience. But it's still far short of AGI.

It's not all that long now before we return to Oz for one final round with Elphaba, Glinda, Fiyero, and more when Wicked: For Good prepares for its curtain call this November. But while we wait, today we got our last big tease for what to expect… including some very interesting tweaks from the beloved musical.

This morning Universal dropped the final trailer for For Good, giving us snippets from a few of the standout songs from the musical's second act—namely “Thank Goodness”, “No Good Deed”, and, of course, “For Good”.

For those who've seen the musical, there's some very intriguing teases and reveals here (including the identity of a few members of the “Fab Four,” Dorothy's party of travelers as they journey down the yellow brick road in The Wizard of Oz). We get a brief glimpse of how the film is going to be handling a certain pivotal scene with Nessa Rose, which actress Marissa Bode already teased as a big change from how the musical portrays the character's disability. We also get a big preview of the catfight between Elphaba and Glinda.

Musical fans know that this little scrap between the two friends comes as a brief, lighthearted moment after another pretty dark pivotal scene (if you know, you know). But in For Good, even though we keep some of the gags as the duo snap back and forth at each other before the fight, it looks like we're going to have that fight itself played a little more seriously, with Glinda practically charging in at Elphaba, swinging her wand around like it's a mace. Duel of the Fates, but with magic items!

We won't have much longer to see just what other tweaks will have been made to pad Wicked‘s pretty brisk second act into a full-blown movie, however: For Good, which stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande alongside Michelle Yeoh, Ethan Slater, Jonathan Bailey, Marissa Bode, Jeff Goldblum, and more, hits theaters November 21.

Venus is officially a lonely planet. After losing contact with the Akatsuki spacecraft last year, Japan's space agency (JAXA) has officially ended operations of the lone mission left in our neighboring planet's orbit.

Earlier this week, JAXA determined that the recovery of its Venus probe was unlikely, prompting it to formally end the 15-year-old mission. Akatsuki, which translates to “dawn” in Japanese, launched on May 21, 2010, to study weather patterns on Venus and confirm the presence of lightning in the planet's thick clouds. The probe famously carried thousands of drawings of iconic Japanese Vocaloid Hatsune Miku, sending the fictional pop star on a unique voyage through space.

Ahead of its launch, JAXA invited the public to send messages on board the probe. Fans of the computer-generated Hatsune Miku, a popular virtual idol created by Crypton Future Media, delivered around 13,000 illustrations of the 16-year-old persona, which were etched onto the spacecraft's aluminum balance weights.

The Akatsuki spacecraft, also known as Planet-C or Venus Climate Orbiter, had a rough start to its journey. During its approach to the second-closest planet to the Sun, the spacecraft suffered an engine malfunction that foiled its attempt to enter Venus' orbit.

The spacecraft remained in hibernation for nearly five years, orbiting around the Sun. JAXA wouldn't give up on its probe, however, and switched from using Akatsuki's main engine to a secondary attitude control engine. Although it only produced about one-fifth of the thrust of the main engine, Akatsuki succeeded in its orbital insertion attempt.

An Enormous Atmospheric Anomaly Has Been Spotted On Venus

Shortly after its orbital insertion, Akatsuki made its first discovery. The spacecraft spotted a huge curved feature in Venus' atmosphere that stretched nearly all the way from the north to the south poles. Scientists later determined that the giant structure was caused by gravity waves, ripples in an atmosphere caused by air moving over rough topography (in this case, the tall mountains of Venus).

Akatsuki became Japan's first successful attempt to explore another planet. The spacecraft is equipped with four cameras at ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths, using a high-speed imager to detect lightning in Venus' clouds and radio science techniques to observe the vertical structure of its atmosphere.

In April 2024, JAXA lost communication with Akatsuki. “We have been attempting to restore communication since last year, but it has been determined that further recovery is unlikely, and we have decided to bring this chapter to a close,” JAXA wrote on X.

Venus won't be alone for long. NASA is preparing to send two missions to the scorching hot planet. The DAVINCI probe is scheduled to launch in 2030, followed by VERITAS in 2031, as part of the agency's initiative to better understand how Venus, which shares similar characteristics to Earth, became a hellish world.

Leasing Nvidia chips instead of buying them outright could help OpenAI build its 10 GW AI empire.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


OpenAI is in advanced talks to lease high-performance GPUs from Nvidia, rather than purchase them outright, as part of its plan to build out custom AI data centers over the next several years. That's according to a report published September 23 by The Information, which cites multiple people familiar with negotiations between the two companies.

The proposed leasing deal, which is reportedly still under discussion and subject to change, would represent a shift in how AI infrastructure is financed. Instead of buying hardware upfront or renting it from cloud providers like Microsoft or Oracle, OpenAI would take possession of Nvidia's AI chips under a five-year lease, potentially reducing capital strain while offloading depreciation risk to the supplier. Sources close to the discussions say OpenAI estimates that the leasing arrangement could cut its total hardware costs by 10 to 15%, although the methodology behind that figure is unclear.

The talks are part of a broader $100 billion strategic partnership between OpenAI and Nvidia, announced on September 22. Under the agreement, OpenAI plans to deploy up to 10 GW of Nvidia-powered infrastructure, with Nvidia providing both financial backing and hardware expertise. Nvidia is also investing $10 billion in OpenAI for a roughly 2% equity stake at a $500 billion valuation.

According to The Information, Nvidia could consider setting up a dedicated financing vehicle to fund the leasing structure. That entity would borrow capital to purchase GPUs and networking hardware, using the chips themselves as collateral. OpenAI's lease payments would then service the loan over the duration of the five-year term.

OpenAI, despite its valuation and revenue potential, lacks the balance sheet to purchase hundreds of billions of dollars in hardware on its own. Its projected cash burn through 2029 is pegged at $115 billion, and previous estimates suggest OpenAI could spend $450 billion renting capacity through 2030. Direct leasing would give it more control over site selection, layout, and workload optimization, all while securing long-term access to Nvidia's next-generation accelerators.

The deal, if finalized, could have ripple effects far beyond OpenAI. A large-scale leasing model could alter how Nvidia allocates inventory, how quickly it phases in new architectures, and how competitors position their own AI silicon.

Scientists have mapped underappreciated scaffolding cells in skin, known as fibroblasts. They show for the first time how fibroblasts go 'rogue' in many different diseases affecting multiple organs – from acne and psoriasis, to rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.

Researchers at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, the Universities of Cambridge and Newcastle, and their collaborators combined single-cell sequencing and spatial genomics datasets with machine learning to identify eight different types of fibroblasts. They show how the fibroblasts form distinct 'tissue neighborhoods' in skin and reveal their shared functions in a range of diseases across various tissues.

Published today (24 September) in Nature Immunology, the researchers suggest that fibroblasts show potential as universal drug targets due to their involvement in multiple diseases across a range of tissues.

This study is part of the international Human Cell Atlas (HCA) consortium, which is mapping all human cells to understand human health, and help diagnose, monitor, and treat disease.

Skin is the largest organ in the body and plays an essential role in protecting us from infections. Two in three British people will suffer from skin disease at some point in their lifetime. Skin diseases account for 24 per cent of the UK's burden of illness, with wound care costing the NHS approximately £8.3 billion annually, and other skin conditions and diseases costing approximately £723 million each year.

Scaffolding cells, known as fibroblasts, are found in skin and every other organ in the body. They are involved in wound healing, scarring, tissue repair, the development of connective tissues and maintenance of skin.

Until now, skin fibroblasts have been somewhat overlooked, partly because their diversity has been difficult to study. While it is known that fibroblasts increase their collagen production and develop muscle-like fibres to contract after wounding, it has been unclear how fibroblast states change across the many diseases observed in skin, from cancers to acne.

Understanding the true diversity of fibroblasts and where they are located in tissues, in both health and disease, presents enormous clinical opportunities due to their roles in scarring and inflammation.

In a new study, Sanger Institute researchers and their collaborators set out to map fibroblasts in human skin, from healthy skin samples and 23 skin disorders, including psoriasis, lupus, skin cancers and acne.

The team generated spatial transcriptomic data – which measures gene expression and how it varies across different locations within a tissue – to spatially map the identified fibroblast populations from normal and diseased human skin.

The researchers found that these scaffolding cells are far more complex than was previously thought. The team discovered five different types of fibroblasts in healthy skin, which are located in distinct 'tissue neighbourhoods' associated with specific functions. Following this, the team looked at fibroblasts and their 'tissue neighbourhoods' in many other organs, including the endometrium, gut and lung in 14 diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and lung cancer. The team identified fibroblast populations shared across organs.

Using machine learning models, they identified three 'rogue' subtypes of fibroblasts that are present in different organs across multiple diseases, including scarring diseases and lung cancer, rheumatoid arthritis in joints and inflammatory bowel disease in the gut.

Interestingly, the researchers found that the same activated fibroblasts that recruit immune cells to early skin wounds were observed in inflammatory diseases, such as acne and inflammatory bowel disease. This suggests that a wound-like fibroblast state is used to attract immune cells to tissues in diseases like acne and inflammatory bowel disease, which both have a risk of scarring.

By identifying shared disease-related and disease-specific fibroblasts within these 'tissue neighbourhoods' across multiple diseases and organs, the researchers identify potential universal drug targets. This means researchers may be able to develop single drugs that work for several diseases across the body.

In the future, the team aims to extend this research to many other cell types across all of the tissues in the human body, and use machine learning and artificial intelligence to find disease-specific 'tissue neighbourhoods' that can be modulated for therapy.

Fibroblasts have critical roles in recruiting immune cells to skin tissue and causing scarring, which can result in a range of skin diseases. We lack highly effective treatments to treat scarring in clinical practice, partly because these cells have been poorly understood. Modern technologies now allow us to begin to understand these critical cells in unprecedented detail. We've shown for the first time that fibroblasts occupy and maintain distinct anatomical microenvironments in skin tissue in health and disease. Our data are freely available and we provide an online tool that can be used by researchers to map fibroblasts from their own studies, to expand our knowledge on fibroblasts in disease.""

Dr. Lloyd Steele, first author at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and University of Cambridge

Dr Mo Lotfollahi, senior author and Group Leader at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: ""Artificial Intelligence is going to be transformative in how we do science in the next 10 years, and guide how we explore vast datasets and make sense of complexities of the human body. Here we used machine learning to classify and map fibroblasts in healthy skin and many different diseases. In the future, we could use AI to query all of the different diseases affecting all of the different cell types in the various tissues across the body, to build a complete picture of what happens in health and disease.""

This discovery highlights the kind of innovative research that can change the way we treat skin disease and beyond. Identifying a universal drug target in scaffolding cells found across the body opens the door to treatments that could benefit millions, and we're proud to support the researchers making this possible.""

Matthew Patey, OBE, Chief Executive Officer at British Skin Foundation

Professor Muzz Haniffa, lead author and Head of Cellular Genomics at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, and Professor of Dermatology and Immunology at Newcastle University, said: ""The clinical relevance of our work is huge – it is paradigm-shifting in terms of how we move from understanding the role of individual cell types to uncovering how disease-specific cell types form 'tissue neighbourhoods' that mediate inflammation. We find the same disease-related fibroblasts involved in several diseases across the body – atopic eczema, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis – meaning we could find universal therapeutic targets in these cells to treat many diseases. This could save time and money in drug development, and reduce side effects for patients.""

About 12 million adults in the United States are affected by PTSD, impacting between 4% and 8% of the adult population – and up to 30% of military personnel and veterans. Strikingly, 63% of veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder also suffer from alcohol use disorder (AUD) and/or chronic pain. These conditions frequently overlap, with individuals who have AUD or chronic pain often also experiencing PTSD.

When these disorders co-occur, they tend to worsen one another, making effective treatment significantly more challenging. Currently, no approved medications effectively treat PTSD and AUD together, and many available drugs come with serious side effects or limited results.

Researchers from Florida Atlantic University's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, in collaboration with the University of Oklahoma College of Pharmacy, conducted two complementary studies in rats to explore how a new drug, PPL-138, might help treat PTSD and its common companions – anxiety, chronic pain, and AUD. A type of opioid partial agonist, PPL-138 works by targeting specific opioid receptors in the brain.

Intellectual property related to PPL-138 is owned by Phoenix PharmaLabs, Inc. The company is in the process of advancing PPL-138 through clinical trials.

The first study, carried out at the University of Oklahoma, looked at whether long-term treatment with PPL-138 could reduce PTSD-related symptoms in chronic traumatic stress. The second study, conducted at FAU, focused on the relationship between trauma, anxiety and alcohol use, and researchers divided rats into different groups. 

Results, published in the British Journal of Pharmacology, provide promising evidence that PPL-138 could become a valuable treatment for PTSD and alcohol misuse – particularly when symptoms are rooted in anxiety. By targeting a brain system involved in both stress and addiction, researchers believe PPL-138 may one day offer a much-needed breakthrough for those struggling with these life-altering conditions.

Findings show that PPL-138 significantly reduced anxiety-like behavior, pain responses, and alcohol consumption – but only in rats that developed PTSD-like symptoms. In both male and female rats, the drug selectively reduced alcohol use in those that also showed signs of trauma-related anxiety, without affecting those that were resilient or not stressed.

Our results show that PPL-138 not only reduces trauma-related anxiety and pain, but also selectively curbs alcohol use in rats most vulnerable to stress-induced drinking. This kind of targeted treatment could transform how we manage PTSD and its comorbidities – especially for the large number of patients who currently fall through the cracks of existing therapies.""

Andrea Cippitelli, Ph.D., lead author and assistant professor, Department of Biomedical Science within the Schmidt College of Medicine and member of the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute

The study findings also emphasize the need to consider sex differences in both the causes and treatment of these overlapping conditions. Among female rats, PPL-138 reduced alcohol intake in those exhibiting anxiety, even if their drinking had not escalated. This indicates that anxiety alone may be a primary factor driving alcohol use in females. 

""Anxious male rats were twice as likely as females to increase their alcohol intake following trauma, while nearly all female rats with more alcohol intake also displayed clear signs of anxiety,"" said Cippitelli. ""This mirrors well-documented patterns in humans, where women are more prone to anxiety-related disorders like PTSD and often use alcohol to cope with emotional distress, whereas men typically engage in heavier, more generalized drinking.""

Importantly, the effects of PPL-138 were not due to sedation or reduced activity. The compound did not alter movement or alcohol consumption in rats with anxiety-related behaviors or traumatic stress. In fact, movement levels remained unchanged in male rats and slightly increased in females – supporting the idea that the drug acts specifically on stress- and anxiety-related behaviors, rather than causing general suppression or sedation.

""This research represents a much-needed step toward helping both civilians and veterans living with the invisible wounds of trauma,"" said Cippitelli. ""In our preclinical studies, PPL-138 shows strong potential as a single therapy for the overlapping symptoms of PTSD, chronic pain, and alcohol misuse – offering a potentially safer and more effective alternative to current multi-drug approaches.""

Updated on September 24, 2025

By Francisco Quatrin

In a surprising development, FIFA president Gianni Infantino met in New York with Alejandro Domínguez, head of CONMEBOL, to evaluate the possibility of expanding the 2030 FIFA World Cup from the already expanded 48-team format (set for 2026) to a groundbreaking 64 national teams. The tournament, which will be hosted primarily by Spain, Portugal, and Morocco, also includes special group-stage matches in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay to honor the centennial of the first World Cup held in Montevideo in 1930.

The meeting also included key South American leaders such as Claudio Tapia (Argentine Football Association), Ignacio Alonso (Uruguayan Football Association), and Robert Harrison (Paraguayan Football Association). Yamandú Orsi, Uruguay president, and Santiago Peña, Paraguay president, were also present. The soccer discussion was described as “historic” by Domínguez, who stressed the ambition of making World Cup 2030 a landmark edition.

According to reports from La Nación, it was Infantino himself who pushed for the meeting and strongly supports the idea of expansion. The World Cup has already grown once: the 2026 edition in the United States, Mexico, and Canada will feature 48 teams instead of the traditional 32. But taking the leap to 64 would be unprecedented, creating a tournament with 128 matches, twice as many as the 64 games played from 1998 to 2022.

The logic behind the move is clear: more teams mean more global participation, more television revenue, and expanded markets. However, critics argue the competition could become too diluted, stretching the calendar and exhausting players. Still, Infantino has been traveling extensively, including a recent visit to Morocco and talks with leaders in Asia and Africa, looking to build consensus for the plan.

The first World Cup was won by Uruguay, who faced Argentina in the final.

If approved, the 2030 World Cup would feature 16 groups of four teams each. The top two teams from every group would move on to the knockout stage, creating a Round of 32. From there, the competition would follow the same elimination model familiar to fans, but with more matches and potentially higher logistical challenges.

For Argentina, the stakes are particularly symbolic. The country is expected to host one of the groups, with River Plate's Monumental Stadium in Buenos Aires reportedly set to stage the national team's opening match. Uruguay and Paraguay would also host group games, with Paraguay even building a new stadium to be ready in time for the tournament.

The decision is not final yet, but Domínguez hinted at “news that will impact the entire world” in the coming months. If FIFA moves forward, the 2030 World Cup would not only celebrate 100 years of history but also mark a new era where global inclusivity and commercial opportunity redefine the tournament.

Abbi Pulling reviews the Baku Grand Prix on The Cooldown Room

Race Recap: Azerbaijan

Max Verstappen has been reflecting on his championship prospects off the back of an upswing in competitiveness for Red Bull.

Max Verstappen has cautioned that “everything needs to go perfectly” for him if he hopes to close the gap in the championship and bid for the title, despite the Dutchman bolstering his points tally after scoring back-to-back wins in Italy and Azerbaijan.

While McLaren faced a challenging weekend in Baku – which saw championship leader Oscar Piastri crash out of the race on Lap 1, while Lando Norris had to settle for P7 – Verstappen enjoyed a dominant outing, converting pole position into a commanding victory.

During a chat with Sky Sports F1 after the Grand Prix, Verstappen was asked if the new floor recently introduced on Red Bull's car has had a particular impact on their performance level over these past weekends.

“I think it's just a combination of a lot of things that are going better in the last few weeks, so we understood a bit more about the car,” the reigning World Champion explained. “Of course it's two low-downforce tracks, so we have to wait and see how we are going to perform again on a high-downforce track.

“But for now we're just very happy with what we're doing, and then we'll just find out [at] the upcoming races how that will go on other kinds of layouts.”

With seven rounds remaining in the 2025 season, Verstappen's run of wins has seen him close the gap to Piastri down to 69 points, while he tails second-placed Norris by 44 points.

When quizzed on whether he still sees opportunities to make gains should McLaren have further difficult weekends, Verstappen responded: “It's seven races to go and it's still 69 points – it's a lot.

“Basically everything needs to go perfectly from my side, and then a bit of luck from their side I need as well, so it's still very tough.”

Speaking further on the topic in Sunday's post-race press conference, the 27-year-old reiterated that he is taking each event as it comes.

Asked if Red Bull's recent increase in competitiveness had given him hope that the title could still be within reach, Verstappen answered: “I mean, I don't rely on hope.

“I personally don't think about it. I just go race by race, what I have been doing basically the whole season – just trying to do the best we can, try to score the most points that we can. And then after Abu Dhabi, we'll know.”

Abbi Pulling reviews the Baku Grand Prix on The Cooldown Room

Race Recap: Azerbaijan

Esteban Ocon and Ollie Bearman give their verdicts on how the Azerbaijan Grand Prix went for Haas.

Haas did not manage to score any points in Azerbaijan, with Ollie Bearman the higher placed of their two drivers in 12th. Esteban Ocon followed him home in 14th after an eventful race that saw the Frenchman suffer contact off the line.

Ocon's weekend had already been compromised by a disqualification in Qualifying for a technical infringement, meaning he started from last. A good getaway saw him fighting with Nico Hulkenberg, but unfortunately the duo collided.

That led to an immediate pit stop due to a puncture, and with the Safety Car out after Oscar Piastri's crash, Haas saw an opportunity to try something different. Having started on the hard tyre, Ocon was fitted with some mediums before coming back in the next lap for more hards.

That gave him 49 laps to try and survive – and thrive – on the C4 compound. He was asked afterwards whether the early collision hampered his race.

“Luckily it didn't – I think for both our races. At least I didn't have heavy damage,” he explained. “It was just a small touch, and it touched the wheels mainly, which was a good thing.

“It was a good start; we tried a really aggressive strategy, which at the end made me lose out quite a lot. So, a bit of a shame on that part. We will review – it has been a difficult weekend for us.

“I think there are a lot of things we can improve for next weekend and this is what we will look out for in Singapore.”

Haas had looked fast at points in practice, with both drivers flirting with the top 10. As such, hopes had been high going into Qualifying, only for Ocon to exit in Q1 before Bearman crashed out in Q2. Those were just the latest in a series of issues for Haas, which Ocon wants to see rectified moving forwards.

“Yesterday [we had] a brake problem, in Monza we had an issue with the front end of the car really that was quite big. So, we just need to enter weekends and have a clean sweep and no issues, and a healthy weekend really. This is what we are all asking for.”

As for Bearman, he knew that Q2 crash was costly as it meant a P15 starting slot on a day where there was only one race retiree, and limited options to move forward.

“Qualifying was tough this weekend; I did a mistake in Q2 that meant I didn't put a lap on the board. Of course, it was very tricky conditions but that is no excuse. So yeah, just need some improvements [needed] for Singapore,” was his take.

“It was a good race overall, we made a good comeback, had really good pace. But starting 15th, lost a few places on the early laps with the Safety Car restart and after that I was really stuck.

“In the first stint, I lost a lot of time stuck behind [Franco] Colapinto and [Lance] Stroll, and after that it was really damage limitation. The car was quick but I couldn't do much with it.”

Haas head to Singapore sitting ninth in the standings, 11 points behind Kick Sauber.

Cherien Dabis' historical drama about a Palestinian family expelled from Jaffa in 1948 bowed at Sundance and is set for a theatrical release and awards season contention.



		By Etan Vlessing, Chris Gardner 

	September 24, 2025 11:30am	




	Javier Bardem and Mark Ruffalo have boarded All That's Left of You, Jordan's selection for the best international feature Oscars category, as executive producers.


	Palestinian-American director Cherien Dabis' historical drama premiered at Sundance and tells a multigenerational story of a family expelled from Jaffa in 1948. When a Palestinian teenager gets swept up into a protest in the occupied West Bank and experiences a moment of violence that rocks his family, his mother recounts the political and emotional threads that led to that fateful moment.

	Spanning seven decades, the epic drama captures the hopes and heartaches of an uprooted family, revealing the scars of displacement and the unbreakable spirit of survival, according to a synopsis from the producers. “Cherien's beautiful, intelligent and deeply moving film All That's Left of You powerfully captures the true story of Palestine that has never been told before in a way that is both artistic and authentic,” Spanish actor Bardem said in a statement.

	Watermelon Pictures and Dabis' new production and distribution company Visibility Films will co-release All That's Left of You. A theatrical run in Los Angeles starting Nov. 28, 2025 is planned to position the movie for awards season play. That will be followed by a release in select cities on Jan. 9, 2026, before opening nationwide.

	











	“All That's Left Of You is an epic, deeply human film that spans decades, capturing the Palestinian Nakba with authenticity, compassion and grace. It reminds us that even in the face of unimaginable loss, our way forward lies in empathy, in finding meaning in grief and in choosing humanity over vengeance,” Ruffalo added in his own statement.


	Dabis' third feature also screened at Telluride after the conflict in Gaza forced principal production to shift from Palestine to Cyprus, Jordan and Greece. Dabis' two previous features, Amreeka (2009) and May in the Summer (2013), both debuted at Sundance. Amreeka went on to win the Fipresci international critics prize at Cannes.


	“I'm beyond thrilled to have two people I deeply admire, Javier Bardem and Mark Ruffalo, join us in amplifying the urgency and importance of this film,” Dabis said in her own statement. “All That's Left of You takes audiences back to 1948 — the origin of Palestinian displacement — and follows one family across nearly eight decades, shaped by political forces beyond their control. It is the untold story of how Palestinians first became refugees, and how that history led us to the present moment. To understand what's happening in Gaza today, we must first understand the history of how we arrived here,” she added.


	Besides writing and directing the film, Dabis stars alongside real-life father and sons Mohammad Bakri, Saleh Bakri and Adam Bakri. The producer credits are shared by Dabis, Thanassis Karathanos, Martin Hampel and Karim Amer. Bardem and Ruffalo executive produce alongside Geralyn Dreyfous.

Universal releases the second movie in theaters on Nov. 21.


							By 

	Mia Galuppo


Film Writer


	In the Wicked: For Good final trailer, Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo return as Glinda and Elphaba, respectively, but this time, each of the witches is on opposite sides of the fight for Oz.


	“Elphaba, they are coming for you,” says Glinda over a scene of pitchfork-carrying Ozians. Elphaba replies, “You're the only friend I've ever had.”




	Also seen in the trailer (below) is Elphaba's wedding to Prince Fiyero (played by Jonathan Bailey), plenty of flying monkeys and Dorthy marching down the yellow brick road. Michelle Yeoh and Jeff Goldblum return for the follow-up and are seen in the trailer as Madame Morrible and the Wizard, respectively, plotting Elphaba's demise. As for the songs, the titular “For Good” can be heard throughout.

	











Wicked: For Good will hit theaters on Nov. 21, a year after the first Wicked started its theatrical run, becoming both a commercial and critical hit. The movie earned over $750 million at the global box office and several Oscar nominations, including best picture, eventually taking home the awards for production design and costume design.

'Fence' and 'Wynd' also getting the scrolling digital treatment as Boom! becomes the latest publisher to strike a partnership with the webcomic giant. 


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


	Indie comic book company Boom! Studios is the latest publisher embracing the ever-growing power of scrolling digital comics.


Webtoon Entertainment, the media company that arguably paved the way for the global mainstream acceptance of the mobile webcomic format, has partnered with Boom! to bring some of the publisher's most popular franchises to the Webtoon platform.




	Webtoon will become the exclusive home to vertical scrolling webcomic editions of Something Is Killing the Children, the horror title written by James Tynion IV and drawn by Werther Dell'Edera. SIKTC is Boom's top-selling comic, with over five million copies sold across various formats. It is now poised to be discovered by a whole new readership under this deal.

	Other comics in the first wave falling under this deal include fantasy Wynd, also written by Tynion, coming-of-age story Fence, and Boom's best-selling 2010s sensation, Lumberjanes.


	“Boom!'s catalog has earned recognition from fans and industry professionals alike for its inspired storytelling,” said Webtoon chief strategy officer and head of global Yongsoo Kim in a statement. “We're excited to partner with them to bring modern classics and genre-defining series like Something Is Killing the Children to new audiences on Webtoon.”


	Stated Boom! president Jen Harned, “Boom! Studios is always looking for more ways to reach new and current fans, and Webtoon's unique platform provides a great opportunity to experience our content.”


	Wynd, drawn by Michael Dialynas, follows Wynd, a young boy harboring the secret that magical blood runs in his veins. When his secret is threatened, he embarks on a dangerous adventure with his best friend. 

	











Fence, which combines sports comics and manga style to tell the story of young fencer Nicholas Cox as he makes a name in the world of competitive fencing and lives up to his father's reputation. C.S. Pacat and Johanna the Mad is the team behind the comic.


Lumberjanes was one of Boom's early hits and was created by Shannon Watters, Grace Ellis, Gus Allen and ND Stevenson. The comic told of a group of girls at a scout camp that is surrounded by supernatural occurrences and creatures. The comic won two Eisner Awards and was nominated for three GLAAD Media Awards.


	Launch dates for each series will be announced at a later date. 


	“It's been incredible to see how Something Is Killing the Children and Wynd have connected with fans,” stated Tynion. “I'm eager to see them in vertical scroll, and grateful for the opportunity to bring them to new readers.”


	Webtoon and Boom! will be teaming up at New York Comic Con for a panel on the reformatting of the established print comics in a panel titled Legends Reborn: Iconic Comics, New Adventures on Webtoon on Oct. 10.


	Webtoon has been making considerable inroads in recruiting traditional comics publishers to its platform. In the spring, it made a deal with IDW to convert acclaimed serial killer story Beneath the Trees Where Nobody Sees, Joe Hill series Locke & Key, and a Godzilla story, among others, to scrolling reading. Other collaborations have occurred with DC Comics and Archie Comics.

The comic and host of popular podcast ‘This Past Weekend' spoke out against historical footage of himself being inserted in a promotional video touting mass deportations of illegal immigrants.


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


	Stand-up comic, actor and popular podcaster Theo Von has called on the Department of Homeland Security to remove a social media clip that includes footage of him apparently  favoring mass deportations. 


	“Yooo DHS i didn't approve to be used in this. I know you know my address so send a check. And please take this down and please keep me out of your ‘banger' deportation videos,” Von said on his X account on Tuesday night. “When it comes to immigration my thoughts and heart are a lot more nuanced than this video allows. Bye!” Von added.

	The 31-second DHS video opens with a historical clip of Von offering up an “aw, shucks”: “Heard you got deported, dude — bye.” That's followed by the promotional video touting President Donald Trump's record on immigrant deportations during his second administration.

	Von is far from the only celeb who's spoken out about being included, without their permission, in DHS social media posts. The music artists Semisonic and Jess Glynne previously objected to their music being used in deportation videos.


	Von's rebuke to the DHS and its clip came just ahead of a mass shooting at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Dallas on Wednesday that reportedly led to one death and two other serious injuries. The alleged shooter apparently died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

	











	Von hosts the podcast This Past Weekend, where he has interviewed high-profile guests like Trump, J.D. Vance and Bernie Sanders. His Netflix comedy specials include No Offense and Regular People.


	But his insistence in the X post over the DHS clip that his views on immigration are “more nuanced” than the promotional video claims indicates his overall political views are harder to pin down as This Past Weekend podcast plays up Von's everyman blend of humor and straight talk.


	On the acting front, Von and David Spade are starring in the buddy comedy Busboys, with the duo having co-written the script and self-financed the project set in an Arizona border town and around two pals who mistakenly believe that becoming waiters will solve all of their problems. Jonah Feingold is directing.

Yooo DHS i didnt approve to be used in this. I know you know my address so send a check. And please take this down and please keep me out of your ‘banger' deportation videos. When it comes to immigration my thoughts and heart are alot more nuanced than this video allows. Bye! https://t.co/5v5gagf4Dr

First Amendment experts says the long-running satirical band's over-the-top schtick is precisely what free speech protections are all about.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	For more than 40 years, the members of thrash metal costumed rock group GWAR have been schlepping their giant intergalactic monster costumes across the planet as part of a wildly over-the-top theatrical show featuring the beheading and/or comically absurd disemboweling of every president from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump.


	The band's fans gleefully push to the front of their gigs in order to get blasted with any manner of fake bodily fluids that erupt from the towering, cartoonish dummies. But over the weekend, some folks who apparently just discovered the band, allegedly got into a tizzy over one aspect of GWAR's current show — a mock beheading of Tesla CEO and former DOGE boss Elon Musk. The tweets appeared to be an attempt to gin up outrage over the formerly uncontroversial bit, at a time when Donald Trump and the chairman of the FCC have been sending ominous messages about their view of the limits on the First Amendment's right to free speech.

	











	“The idea that GWAR is normalizing violence is patently absurd,” lead singer Michael “Blöthar the Berserker” Bishop tells Billboard about a hair-on-fire headline from the New York Post tabloid earlier this week that read: “Heavy Metal Band Stage Phony Beheading of Elon Musk, Murder Trump in Shocking Festival Performance.”




	The show in question was the band's appearance at the Riot Fest in Chicago, which, as noted above, was in keeping with their performance style of the past four decades, during which they have taken their prop chainsaws and swords to public figures left, right, and center, including former Sec. of State Hillary Clinton, Justin Bieber and Pope Francis, as well as America's most recent non-Trump president, democrat Joe Biden.


	The Post piece was seemingly inspired by a tweet in which someone — credited as <a href=”https://<a href=”https://ubpass.co/billboard” target=”_blank” rel=”noopener noreferrer”>   <img     src=”https://i.imgur.com/2HpFicp.png”     alt=”Billboard VIP Pass”     style=”max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;”   /> @hottakekaren, which many suspected was a fake account — said the band's act was not “edgy, it's grotesque and reckless and normalizes violence against a real person. This is not okay.”


	Bishop was both annoyed and surprised by the alleged outrage, noting that the band have been at this for a long time — and that GWAR has always been, like punk rock in many ways, “chaotic and indecipherable” in its politics. “We're not millionaires that are afraid of what people are going to say when they see what we do,” he says, questioning if the tweets allegedly denigrating the band were posted by actual humans with a bone to pick or bots. “Yeah, it pissed me off! We're a group of artists that makes art, and it's really the idea that what we have done is normalizing violence… there's nothing normal about the violence that goes on at a GWAR show. It's a cartoon, it's Looney Tunes.”

	











	The fake blood-spurting bits are the way they are for a reason, he says: because the band doesn't want people to see what their doing and think of it as a realistic depiction of violence. “It's a parody of violence,” Bishop says of the seven-foot-tall Musk puppet in a DOGE shirt who got his prop head lopped off — in a costume the singer says is frequently switched out to represent whoever the band says it does based on the story they're telling on that album cycle. “It's trying to make violence into a spectacle and show humanity's absolute absurdity. That's what GWAR is, it's absurdism. To say it's normalizing violence is really reaching.”


	And while it's nothing new, the headline came in the midst of the national debate over ABC pulling Jimmy Kimmel off the air last week, after the late night host made a joke related to the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The joke resulted in Nexstar, which owns more than two dozen ABC-affiliated stations, saying they were going to yank Kimmel's show indefinitely. A day after the monologue, FCC chair Brendan Carr appeared on YouTuber Benny Johnson's show and appeared to make a threat to revoke ABC affiliate licenses over Kimmel's comments.


	“What people don't understand is that the broadcasters … have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest,” said Carr. “When we see stuff like this, look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.” The comments from Carr were interpreted by many as a threat to chill free speech, or, as similar conduct featuring informal government pressure to influence private action is referred to: “jawboning.”

	











	“The First Amendment protects expression in the form of music,” Kevin Goldberg, vice president and First Amendment expert at the non-partisan First Amendment education organization Freedom Forum tells Billboard. “What you're seeing and what you're hearing [from GWAR] is fully protected by the First Amendment, as is the right to engage in parody and satire as part of that performance.”


	At at time when Trump — who has been the target of multiple assassination attempts — has complained that “97%” of what the media says about him is negative, Goldberg says that while GWAR's act is protected speech, there are two unprotected areas that are not covered by the First Amendment that have been bandied about over the past two weeks. He says both of them are currently being widely misinterpreted.


	While the unprotected area of speech is “much narrower” than you might think based on the current conversations in the public sphere, Goldberg says one of them, “true threat,” requires the person using that speech to intend or know that their speech is going to make someone fear for their safety. “That's a very specific type of threat, and parody and satire is so rhetorical and over-the-top that it can't be taken plausibly by the subject to be an actual threat,” he says.


	The same is true for the other unprotected area, “incitement to imminent lawless violence” — which, he says, by its very name requires an intent to have people go and immediately carry out some kind of lawless act. “That's not what's happening here. That's not what they want people to do,” Goldberg says of GWAR. “They want people to understand that they're making a political statement and that's why we have this broad protection for speech that may even seem like it incites violence because we want to protect political speech. And that's what I would say this is, political speech.”

	











	Yes, it it unconventional and perhaps startling speech, but that's the point. Though, Goldberg adds, that “everything is contextual at all times,” meaning that a gesture that might have been laughed off as pure, fantastical parody might feel a bit different during a time when actual, deadly, political violence has shaken both democrats and republicans over the past few years. 


	“GWAR needs to understand that in this moment in time suggesting the beheading of the president or Elon Musk could be taken more seriously by some members of the public who have no idea of their intent based on past history,” says Goldberg. “Their [GWAR's] understanding is, ‘We've always done it this way — but now you're paying attention.'”


	Regardless, Goldberg adamantly reiterated that, of course, what GWAR is doing is “completely” protected by the First Amendment, even if it is an “extreme version” of political speech. Not for nothing, Goldberg notes that back in the 1985, it was democrats — led by Parents Music Resource Center co-founder Tipper Gore — who formed a bipartisan U.S. government committee aimed at policing children's access to music that they deemed to have sexual, violent or drug-related content. 


	“The threat of censorship has always lingered over the music industry from both sides of the political aisle,” says Goldberg. 


	GWAR singer Bishop says he's “absolutely” worried that the nation's bedrock free speech rights are imperiled at the moment. In a Truth Social rant posted just before Kimmel's return on Tuesday night (Sept. 23), Trump — who the comedian noted in his emotional monologue, said in 2022, “if we don't have free speech, then we just don't have a free country” — took another ominous shot at the show and parent company ABC.

	











	“He [Kimmel] is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do,” Trump wrote in a comment that some media pundits took as a threat of further legal action against the Disney-owned network. (ABC News settled a $16 million defamation lawsuit filed by Trump last year over remarks from anchor George Stephanopoulos inaccurately claiming that the president had been found civily liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll.)


	While Bishop doesn't see anything funny about what he feels is a clear and present danger to free speech right now, the organizers of Riot Fest took a very different tack when responding to the alleged outrage over the set. 


	“Like I know this is a rage bait engagement farming twitter account, but “GWAR crossed a major line” is one of the funniest f–king things I've ever heard,” read one mocking tweet among many from the fest, with another adding, “The dumbest people on the internet are still mad today. Got to love it. As long as they keep posting that awesome video and mentioning our name for the free publicity it's a win for me.”

Taylor Swift is right on target with her latest The Life of a Showgirl vinyl variant. 


	On Wednesday (Sept. 24), the pop star announced on Instagram that Target will be carrying a store-exclusive version of her upcoming album. Dubbed The Life of a Showgirl: The Crowd Is Your King, the limited pressings will feature a “summertime spritz pink shimmer” disc along with a collectible sleeve, a “giant” double-sided poster, an exclusive poem penned by Swift and special photos, according to the description.


	“A showgirl knows to save some of her best tricks for the grand finale…,” Swift wrote in her post, sharing photos of the Target edition. “PS: we're [nine] days away(!!!!!!!!!!!!)”

	











	Available for purchase at $34.99, the Target exclusive will also feature its own custom cover art. The gold-toned image finds the artist looking down at the camera while draped in sparkly lingerie and feathers.

	The news follows a series of other Showgirl vinyls released by Swift, as well as a batch of Target-only Showgirl CDs containing exclusive double-sided posters. Featuring exclusive artwork, photographs and poetry, each vinyl variant became available for just 48 hours on the 14-time Grammy winner's website.


	In a recent Instagram video from Taylor Nation, Swift's official fan site, the musician explained why she wanted Showgirl to be available in so many different forms. “The photoshoot we did with Mert and Marcus was so extraordinary, and I was so happy with it, that I just wanted fans to have as many images from this world, this album era, as possible,” she said. “I really spent a lot of time figuring out how I could make the best vinyl product, the best packaging, the best CD experience that they could have … I hope the fans are happy.”


	Arriving Oct. 3, The Life of a Showgirl will mark Swift's first album since her 2024 17-week Billboard 200 chart-topper The Tortured Poets Department. The singer first announced the new LP on fiancé Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce's New Heights podcast, where she revealed that she'd made all 12 songs on the project with Max Martin and Shellback during her global Eras Tour.

	











	“I was so mentally stimulated and excited to be creating,” she said at the time. “[The album is] a lot more upbeat, and it's a lot more fun pop excitement. My main goals were melodies that were so infectious, you're almost angry at it.”


	“We've made songs that I'm so proud of,” she added at the time. “We've never actually made an album before where it was just the three of us, there's no other collaborators. It felt like catching lightning in a bottle. These guys, they're just geniuses. Working with them again was absolutely incredible.”

EXCLUSIVE: With her time playing Eleven on the hit series Stranger Things coming to an end later this year, Millie Bobby Brown looks to have already found that next great character to play as sources tell Deadline the Emmy-nominee is in final negotiations to star as Olympian Kerri Strug in the pic Perfect. Gia Coppola is on board to direct and while a deal isn't closed, sources say Netflix is in negotiations to land the package.


	Ronnie Sandahl is writing with Brown producing under her PMCA banner. Lead producers are Nik Bower for Riverstone Pictures and Thomas Benski for Magna Studios.

	With the Strug story, Brown gets the opportunity to tackle not only one of the great Olympic stories of all time, but one of the great sport stories of its era. A member of the 1996 American gymnastics team dubbed “the Magnificent Seven,” Strug played a huge role in clinching the gold after performing the vault on a badly injured ankle. The image of her landing it perfectly and then having that ankle give out only to have her coach carry her off the mat is still considered one of the more memorable moments in Olympic history. Sources say the plan is to shoot the movie next spring.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Ever since her breakout role in the first season of Stranger Things, Brown has done a good job of picking her non-Stranger Things projects including her very successful Enola Holmes franchise with the third film expected to bow sometime soon. With this project, she gets her first big chance to sink her teeth into something that could play for the awards crowd similar to when Margot Robbie played Tonya Harding in I, Tonya.

	











	Next up for Brown is the final season of Stranger Things, which Netflix release over three volumes with the first set of episodes bowing over Thanksgiving weekend and the final episode bowing on New Years Eve. She also has Enola Holmes 3 and is about to start filming the Netflix pic Just Picture It opposite Gabriel LaBelle.


	Coppola feature directorial debut Palo Alto premiered at Telluride, Venice and Toronto Film Festivals before its 2014 Tribeca Film release. She directed and co-wrote, Mainstream, which premiered worldwide at the 2020 Venice Film Festival and played at the Telluride & Toronto Film Festivals. Her latest film, The Last Showgirl, stars Pamela Anderson, Jamie Lee Curits, and Dave Bautista, and garnered Anderson a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Drama Motion Picture.  


	Brown is repped by WME and PCMA Management and Productions and Coppola is repped by CAA and Untitled Entertainment

			By Anthony D'Alessandro, Nancy Tartaglione 


	Finally, Warner Bros‘ audacious $140 million swing, Paul Thomas Anderson‘s One Battle After Another, opens this weekend. It is expected to reach a $20 million-$25 million domestic take and another $25M abroad for a $50M worldwide debut on the high end.


	Should the movie hit those numbers, or even if, God forbid, the movie's domestic start is in the high teens, it will still rep Anderson's biggest opening ever at the box office, even on a global basis. The 11-time Oscar-nominated filmmaker has typically had his canon platformed; the best U.S./domestic weekend ever for an Anderson movie was 2009's There Will Be Blood, which did $4.8M in its fifth session at 855 theaters.

	











	Everything about this movie has been bold, from its notoriety as the biggest budget for Anderson movie to its shoot in VistaVision and skipping the fall film festival troika for an awards-season launch. Still, it is rallying a 98% fresh critics score on Rotten Tomatoes in what has been arguably the most hotly buzzed title for Oscar season. For Warner Bros, the DiCaprio movie is a marathon, not a sprint. Props here to the studio at least for making a big-budget movie in the state of California, particularly on the Pearblossom Highway outside L.A.




			Watch on Deadline		







	A box office win here will continue to underscore the brilliance of the water tower studio with original fare this year after Sinners and Weapons. If it's a miss, there isn't any crying over spilt milk. The Warner Bros feature slate will still be profitable for calendar-year 2025, and can withstand the impact should One Battle After Another come up short in its theatrical window.

	











	For the Michael De Luca- and Pam Abdy-run motion picture administration, the Anderson-DiCaprio socio-political action movie was a gamble worth taking. When it comes to getting in business with an auteur and DiCaprio, One Battle After Another‘s budget is lower than the actor's previous Martin Scorsese movie, Killers of the Flower Moon, at $200M, and it's right around the Oscar-winning actor's Western The Revenant at $135M. Not to mention, One Battle After Another was bought at auction. If Warners didn't buy the movie at this level, another studio or streamer would have.


	No matter where One Battle After Another settles, it's primed to be Anderson's highest-grossing movie ever even if it's slow out of the gates. It will overtake the top spot currently held by 2007's period drama There Will Be Blood, which made $40.2M domestic and $76.4M worldwide.


	What One Battle After Another has going for it aside from the Anderson devotees is DiCaprio, DiCaprio, DiCaprio, who is out in full force doing interviews at red carpet premieres, the Kelce brothers' podcast and sitting down with Jimmy Fallon (the first time he has sat down at The Tonight Show since 2006, when Jay Leno was hosting). One of the reasons why the movie was greenlit at its production cost is because the DiCaprio has the tendency to deliver huge openings for the auteurs he works with (i.e., Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Alejandro G. Iñárritu, Baz Luhrmann) — of late that is. The opening craved here, and indicative of the movie's previous early August date (before Weapons took it over), was $40M, on par with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. 


	The trailer for One Battle After Another dropped in late March, with extended footage show at CinemaCon in April. Trailers were splashed all over NFL games in addition to being attached on big movies like Warner Bros' Superman. But the best marketing tool for One Battle After Another aside from DiCaprio is the movie itself: those who watch can't say that 2-hour, 41-minute running time is a snooze, rather the pic is an adrenaline rush.


	It's quite a feat that thanks to Scorsese and DiCarpio's names alone, 2023's Killers of the Flower Moon opened to $23.2M, saddled with a 3 hour-, 26-minute running time — and that's when the actors strike prevented the cast from doing any kind of PR. In PostTrak exits, 53% came because it was a Scorsese movie, while 34% bought tickets for DiCaprio.


	The expectation is that One Battle After Another has more going for it. DiCaprio's recent movies, Flower Moon and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, received an A- and B Cinemascores, respectively.


	Now, the biggest battle for the movie remains its liberal-leaning tone, making any play in the heartland and red state areas tricky. Some will argue the movie is really about Sean Penn's military antagonist who chases down DiCarpio's dormant 1980s rabble rouser. However, One Battle After Another is a movie about an anarchist against “the man” in a search of his daughter. It also couldn't be a more relevant film speaking truths to the current MAGA-leaning power. The movie's opening sequence at an ICE holding facility is so chilling it feels like Anderson shot it last week.


	Stateside we understand that advance tickets sales for One Battle After Another are ahead of Killers of the Flower Moon with solid business in New York and Los Angeles and climbing in other major cities. Stateside previews begin Thursday at 2 p.m, at 3,200 sites, expanding to 3,500 theaters by Friday. Males under and over 25 are the best in first choice.


	The movie is releasing in all major offshore markets on a total of 17,000 global screens, with Japan, Korea and Turkey going later. At the international box office, One Battle After Another is expected to play like a Tarantino title, which means that France should be one of the biggest proponents. In terms of the foreign push, DiCarpio and crew attended a fan event in Mexico for the pic along with its  London premiere.


	Also opening this weekend is Universal/DreamWorks' big-screen take of the Netflix preschool series Gabby's Dollhouse, which is eyeing $13M-$15M at 3,500 theatres. The live-action/animated hybrid stars Kristen Wiig, Gloria Estefan and Laila Lockhart Kraner and is rated G.

	











	Blurb: Gabby (Lockhart Kraner, reprising her role from the series) heads out on a road trip with her Grandma Gigi (Estefan) to the urban wonderland of Cat Francisco. But when Gabby's dollhouse, her most prized possession, ends up in the hands of an eccentric cat lady named Vera (Wiig), Gabby sets off on an adventure through the real world to get the Gabby Cats back together and save the dollhouse before it's too late. Stateside previews are at 2 p.m. Girls under 12 and moms are making a date for this.


	Lionsgate meanwhile has the horror sequel Strangers: Chapter 2 at 2,650 locations with an expected $6-7M start. Starring Madelaine Petsch, Gabriel Basso and Amy Horvath, the Renny Harlin-directed sequel follows a couple whose vehicle breaks down on the final day of their cross-country road trip, forcing them to take refuge in a remote Airbnb. As night falls, three masked strangers terrorize them until dawn. Strangers: Chapter 1 opened to $11.8M and legged out to $35M+ domestic. The previous Strangers movies count over $161M at the global box office. Men over 25 have the most first choice.

Jimmy Kimmel made his return to late-night on Tuesday, a week after Disney and ABC made the call to pull Jimmy Kimmel Live! from the air, citing the host's comments about the right-wing response to Charlie Kirk's death. Media companies Sinclair and Nexstar are continuing to preempt the series. Still, while it didn't air on their ABC-affiliate channels last night, Kimmel's 30-minute monologue has racked up nearly 12 million views in the past 12 hours on YouTube.


	The views are continuing to climb, setting the video on track to be the most-viewed upload from Jimmy Kimmel Live! since the host sat down with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and 50 Cent last year. That clip sits at 16 million views.


	“Maybe most of all, I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” Kimmel said in his emotional monologue. “People I never would have imagined, like Ben Shapiro, Clay Travis, Candace Owens, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul. Even my old pal Ted Cruz.… Even though I don't agree with many of those people on most subjects — some of the things they say even make me want to throw up — it takes courage for them to speak out against this administration, and they did, and they deserve credit for it.”

	











	This throws a wrench into the Trump administration's plans. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr claimed that Kimmel attempted to push the narrative that Kirk's shooter “was somehow a MAGA or Republican-motivated person,” again calling it “sick,” in an effort to have the show pulled. 

	











	Donald Trump himself threw something of a fit about Kimmel's return. In a rant on Truth Social, he declaring that he intends to sue ABC for bringing the show back. “I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back,” Trump wrote. “The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‘talent' was never there.”

	He added: “He is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers! Let Jimmy Kimmel rot in his bad Ratings.”

	Trump is referencing the settlement in which Paramount agreed to pay $16 million in donations to the future Trump Library after he filed a lawsuit against 60 Minutes, objecting to an interview with Kamala Harris that was not edited to his liking. Around the same time, Paramount was vying for federal approval of an $8 billion merger with Skydance, which had been in limbo for some time.


	When Stephen Colbert referred to the deal as a “big fat bribe,” Paramount suddenly announced it was ending The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, despite the show's top-ranking ratings. Maybe Trump assumed the same would happen to Kimmel. However, if more than 11 million people are willing to tune in online as well, his fight can't be with the networks. Is he going to sue YouTube next? That would make for a great Jimmy Kimmel Live! segment.

Theo Von slammed the Department of Homeland Security for using his viral comedy clips in their promotional videos for deportations. On Tuesday, the DHS shared an upload that opened with Von saying, “Heard you got deported, dude, bye!” The moment was clipped from a longer video, which includes the critical context of the podcast host meeting a fan who asked if he could record a video for a friend who had been deported.


	“Yooo DHS i didnt approve to be used in this,” Von wrote on X. “I know you know my address so send a check. And please take this down and please keep me out of your ‘banger' deportation videos. When it comes to immigration my thoughts and heart are alot more nuanced than this video allows. Bye!”

Yooo DHS i didnt approve to be used in this. I know you know my address so send a check. And please take this down and please keep me out of your ‘banger' deportation videos. When it comes to immigration my thoughts and heart are alot more nuanced than this video allows. Bye! https://t.co/5v5gagf4Dr


	The DHS and official White House social media accounts have been attempting to capitalize on viral trends to promote the mass deportations occurring across the country. In the video Von criticized, for example, the clip is followed by scenes in which people are being handcuffed and transported for deportation. It brags about the removal of “2 million [people] in 250 days,” and includes a clip of Donald Trump saying immigrants have “simply stopped coming.”

	











	In late July, the White House tried to jump on the “Jet2 Holiday” commercial meme — which features Jess Glynne's 2015 hit single “Hold My Hand” — to promote U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportations. The caption read: “When ICE books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation. ✈️🎶 Nothing beats it!” It accompanied a video of multiple men restrained in hand and leg cuffs being deported. Conveniently, the ICE agents faces were blurred out, but not the people they detained. 

	











	If the goal is to make the Trump administration's efforts look cool or less sinister, their memes are only doing the opposite. “This post honestly makes me sick,” Glynne said at the time. “My music is about love, unity, and spreading positivity, never about division or hate.”

	“It's amazing and it's scary because you don't have control. I'm grateful for it, but at the same time, it's very lawless in that world. People can make whatever they want,” Von told Rolling Stone in 2023 about his fear of losing ownership or control over his viral content. “We've created an environment where one thing that gets out there can make it so that that's all you are.”


	Von hosted Trump on his podcast, This Past Weekend, ahead of the 2024 presidential election, and JD Vance earlier this year. Meanwhile, this past weekend, reports emerged that two American military cargo jets deported people to Africa on flights that appear to have had their transponders turned off, preventing tracking by obscuring their locations from public flight databases and other nearby aircraft. The secret flights are part of what appears to be a surge in ICE activity across the African continent, following a pressure campaign led by Trump on many of the governments there over the summer.

New footage out of Mexico appears to show multiple drones in the skies of Mexico.

There's another puzzling UFO video that has hit the web.

As OutKick readers know, chatter and speculation about UFOs is one of the most fascinating topics in America.

The subject's popularity isn't slowing down. In fact, it's only growing larger and larger with every passing day.

With every new photo or video, it seems like more and more of the public get pulled in. That now includes a very strange video.

The YouTube channel @CuentameTusMiedos posted a video last week that shows several large lights off in the distance.

The location of the filming was near Tulcingo de Valle, according to BroBible, and it's possible they were flying in the direction of Popocatepetl.

You can watch the video below, and send me your theories to David.Hookstead@outkick.com.

What do we all think? What do we think could have been filmed in the sky over Tulcingo de Valle? Little green aliens or something else?

I, obviously, don't have any extra or inside information, but my gut feeling is we're looking at drones. The objects aren't moving incredibly fast but do seem to have some size to them.

Perhaps the objects are military drones. I think we can safely rule out airplanes. Not even close to enough speed.

Having said that, the fact the objects are all flying in perfect formation adds a little more intrigue as well. That would seem to indicate some level of coordination.

Again, not sure I can make any definitive conclusions based on that, but it's certainly interesting. It's another example of a UFO situation where there's no clear answer, but plenty to dissect.

In the second episode of Season 3 of Paranormal Prison, our guests are The Dillinger Escape Plan guitarist Ben Weinman and vocalist Dimitri Minakakis.

The two join hosts Josh Bernstein (The Power Hour, Z2) and Katrina Weidman, who you may be familiar with if you've ever watched the paranormal investigative TV show Portals to Hell with Jack Osbourne. Together, they traverse the haunted grounds of the infamous Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, also home to the annual Inkarceration Music & Tattoo Festival.

For the third year, some of the fest's biggest stars explore various areas of the prison, which has a rich history of being haunted. This time, the crew has leveled up, bringing some new spirit-seeking equipment to the investigations.

In this episode, Weinman and Minakakis gear up, utilizing a spirit box, dead bell and EMF detector, settling into various areas of the prison while prompting any potential lingering spirits with questions.

""I am a pretty skeptical person but there are literally just things we can't explain and there's even things that are so wild that we can explain, like infrared and things we can't see,"" Weinman confesses. ""I do believe that extreme trauma can leave a mark, so even if there is some kind of unknown scientific explanation for how that can imprint on a place... I do believe there could be something to it.""

Despite being a bit skeptical, the open-minded Weinman is jarred when he feels something touch his arm while scanning one of the rooms in the prison. Suddenly, the whole thing gets a lot more real, with Weinman and Minakakis on full alert.

The dead bell is used to communicate yes or no answers and the spirit in the room gravitate toward Weinman, eager to answer his questions. ""We're sorry,"" Weinman says when receiving an affirmative answer that the spirit in the room was abandoned by their family.

Watch the full episode below and watch the two Dillinger members get a little spooked.

All nine new episodes of Paranormal Prison will air each Wednesday at 3PM ET, exclusively on Loudwire's YouTube channel.

This year's lists of special guest paranormal investigators includes members of Five Finger Death Punch, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Kittie, Acid Bath, Three Days Grace, Attila, Nothing More, Drain and Alpha Wolf.

Inkcarceration Music & Tattoo Festival is held each year at the historic Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield.

Construction began back in 1886 and the prison was operational from 1896 through 1990 and it was also used in a scene in the classic movie, The Shawshank Redemption. While the prison remains open to tourism, the most exciting moment of the year is certainly when the fest rolls into town for a long weekend of rock and metal.

Inkcarceration is one of many of Danny Wimmer Presents' premiere festivals. Since its formation in 2011, DWP has become a leading promoter in heavy music and beyond, building up the U.S. festival circuit that dominates the spring, summer and fall months.

The DWP festival roster also includes Aftershock, Born & Raised, Bourbon & Beyond, Golden Sky Country Music Festival, Louder Than Life, Rocklahoma, Sonic Temple and Welcome to Rockville.

Lovers of the supernatural and the extraterrestrial are invited to Visit Hopkinsville's first-ever GoblinCon UFO and Paranormal Expo in October.

When she was named Executive Director of Visit Hopkinsville, Amy Rogers says she knew she wanted to spotlight some of Hopkinsville's extraterrestrial history.

In 1955, the Hopkinsville police station was swarmed with reports of people saying they had a close encounter with extraterrestrial beings in the Kelly community. The incident later became known as the Kelly Green Men Encounter.

Members of the Kelly community would host an annual festival spotlighting the alien encounter, but during the COVID-19 pandemic the festival ended. Rogers says Hopkinsville extraterrestrial history is important, and looks forward to revitalizing the story of the Kelly Green Men at GoblinCon.

Along with learning about the Kelly encounter, Rogers says they will have panels and special guests talking about the Bell Witch, the Beast of Land Between the Lakes, Bigfoot and much more.

For the kiddos, Rogers says they are going to have an outdoor Kids' Zone and a game room with arcade games and board games. There will also be a cosplay competition, so folks are invited to dress up in their best alien costume.

GoblinCon will include a wide variety of food and merchandise vendors, and Rogers says they are still looking for more. Along with vendors, Rogers says they are looking for more volunteers to ensure the event runs smoothly.

Along with all the fun, Rogers says they are also focused on giving back to the community. During the event, Rogers says they will be hosting a food drive for the Aaron McNeil House, a local nonprofit that provides food for those in need. Those who donate will be put into a raffle to win some prizes.

GoblinCon takes over the Bruce Convention Center on October 17 and October 18. General and VIP tickets are available at goblinconky.com.","{'href': 'https://whopam.com', 'title': 'whopam.com'}","other"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Him Review: A Supernatural Sports Fumble","https://www.themovieblog.com/2025/09/him-review-a-supernatural-sports-fumble/","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 19:26:13 GMT","

On paper, Him had all the makings of an exciting, genre-bending project. Directed by Justin Tipping and co-written by Skip Bronkie, Zack Akers, and Tipping, the film comes from Monkeypaw Productions, the company founded by Jordan Peele that has made a name for itself with high-concept, socially charged horror. The premise of Him alone is enticing: a young football prodigy, Cameron Cade (Tyriq Withers), sees his career nearly derailed by violence, only to be offered a lifeline by his idol, Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans), a fading quarterback with secrets buried deep in his private training compound.

The blend of sports drama, psychological horror, and supernatural dread has potential for originality. Unfortunately, potential is all Him ever manages. What emerges instead is a muddled, inconsistent film that stumbles in tone, undercuts its suspense, and fails to deliver either as a horror movie or as an emotionally gripping story. The final product is a confused film that feels like three different projects stitched together without rhythm, focus, or identity.



The screenplay is Him's most glaring issue. For a story that sets itself up around questions of ambition, obsession, and the price of greatness, the dialogue is clunky and on-the-nose, robbing scenes of any naturalism. Characters frequently deliver lines that sound more like mission statements than conversation, leaving viewers painfully aware of the script's heavy hand.

The plot, meanwhile, fails to capitalize on its central mystery. The film toys with supernatural elements—a shadowy figure watching over Cam's training, strange injuries that defy logic, Isaiah's cryptic sermons about sacrifice—but rarely commits to them. The result is a film that gestures at cosmic horror without ever clarifying the rules of its world. Is the evil at work a manifestation of Isaiah's ego, a literal demonic force, or something psychological in Cam's mind? By the end, the ambiguity feels less like intentional complexity and more like indecision.

Even worse, Him structures itself like a slow-burning psychological thriller but lacks the precision and restraint that such pacing demands. Scenes drag on without purpose, cutting to repetitive montages of Cam running drills or Isaiah whispering vague threats about “the game.” Instead of building tension, the film repeats itself into exhaustion.

Casting Marlon Wayans as Isaiah White could have been a masterstroke. Wayans, known mostly for comedy, has shown glimpses of dramatic range in the past. Here, however, his performance is uneven. At times he taps into Isaiah's charisma and simmering menace, suggesting a man who has lived too long in the spotlight. But the script demands that he switch erratically from mentor to tyrant to unhinged cult leader, and Wayans never finds the connective tissue between these facets. His attempts at gravitas too often collapse into melodrama.

Tyriq Withers, as Cameron, struggles in the lead role. While earnest, his performance is hampered by a lack of development for his character. Cam is written less as a three-dimensional person and more as a blank canvas onto which themes are projected. Withers gives physicality to the role, particularly in the football sequences, but he cannot overcome the absence of a convincing psychological arc. His transformation from ambitious athlete to haunted victim is abrupt and unconvincing.

Julia Fox, as Elsie White, Isaiah's influencer wife, is perhaps the film's most wasted asset. The script teases that Elsie might hold the key to Isaiah's secrets, but she is reduced to delivering Instagram-ready quips and hollow warnings. Her subplot could have offered a meaningful counterpoint to Cam's struggle, but it is abandoned before it develops.

Supporting turns from Tim Heidecker as Cam's opportunistic manager and Jim Jefferies in a brief role as a sports commentator provide little more than comic relief, which clashes tonally with the film's supposed darkness.

Monkeypaw's involvement sets high expectations for atmosphere and originality, but Him fails to deliver either. Tipping's direction relies heavily on visual clichés. And it's just so mind-boggling as to what Peele and the rest of the Monkeypaw folks saw in this project.

The compound setting—a sprawling mansion with a private field—could have been mined for claustrophobic unease. Instead, it is underutilized. Scenes meant to convey dread are often flatly lit and unimaginatively staged, more like a television drama than a theatrical horror release. The editing compounds the problem, stretching moments of silence into tedium rather than suspense. Also, the soundtrack might be the worst in a horror film in an exceptionally long time.

Even the football action, which could have grounded the film in visceral physicality, is blandly choreographed. The drills, scrimmages, and hits lack intensity, leaving viewers with no sense of the brutality or stakes inherent to the sport. When the supernatural finally intersects with the game, the effects look cheap and unconvincing, undercutting the intended horror.

Him wants to grapple with the dangers of hero worship, the commodification of athletes, and the blurred line between ambition and self-destruction. These are fertile thematic grounds, particularly in today's culture of sports celebrity. But the film approaches them with such a lack of subtlety that they feel more like afterthoughts than insights.

Isaiah's philosophy about sacrifice is hammered into the script so frequently that it loses any impact. Cam's arc, meant to symbolize the struggle between independence and indoctrination, collapses under the weight of clichés. Instead of exploring how obsession with legacy corrodes the self, Him reduces the idea to Isaiah growling monologues about “greatness” while Cam looks increasingly bewildered.

The supernatural element, which could have elevated these themes into metaphor, is barely sketched. Viewers are left with hints of a demonic presence or cursed ritual, but no clarity on what it represents. The final act attempts to pull everything together in a shocking climax, but the ending lands with confusion rather than revelation.

Monkeypaw Productions has earned its reputation for innovative horror that blends genre thrills with sharp social commentary. Him is a rare misfire for the studio. Instead of sharpening its premise into something bold and resonant, the film meanders in circles, unsure of whether it wants to be a chilling sports allegory, a haunted-house story in shoulder pads, or a psychological duel between mentor and protégé.

The result is a film that pleases neither horror fans nor sports enthusiasts. Viewers seeking scares will find recycled imagery and shallow shocks. Those invested in the football drama will find little insight into the pressures of the game. And anyone hoping for Monkeypaw's signature cultural sharpness will be disappointed by its absence.

Him is a frustrating experience precisely because its premise holds such promise. A supernatural sports horror could have carved out a unique niche, offering both genre thrills and commentary on the cult of athletic stardom. Instead, the film settles for a messy script, underwhelming performances, and half-hearted horror.

Despite it being only ninety-six minutes, Him overstays its welcome, dragging viewers through endless repetition without ever rewarding their patience. By the time the credits roll, what lingers is not fear, awe, or reflection—but disappointment.

Him drops the ball spectacularly, proving that even with an intriguing concept and a talented production team, sloppy execution can sink the game.

Summary

On paper, Him had all the makings of an exciting, genre-bending project. Directed by Justin Tipping and co-written by Skip Bronkie, Zack Akers, and Tipping, the film comes from Monkeypaw Productions, the company founded by Jordan Peele that has made a name for itself with high-concept, socially charged horror.

Colter Shaw (Justin Hartley) is back, looking for missing people in Tracker Season 3. The hit CBS series returns next month on October 19, and with just a few weeks remaining, CBS has released a teaser trailer. In it, Colter is back on the road, traversing the roads of rural and urban America in the search for those lost. His job pits him against nature and people, and in some instances, the only way out is through punches. Meanwhile, he's dealing with some recent discoveries about his family. The season premiere features a Shaw Family reunion as he joins forces with his brother Russell (Jensen Ackles) to find two missing women. The logline for Tracker Season 3, Episode 1, ""The Process,"" reads:

""As Colter grapples with the shocking truth surrounding his father's death, Russell joins forces with his brother to help track down the missing wife and daughter of one of Reenie's clients. Their reunion finds them mixed up in a chain of events involving a sinister underground operation known as ""The Process.""

Tracker introduced a mystery in the pilot episode about the death of Ashton Shaw. The show has been peeling back layers of the story throughout the past two seasons, reaching an inflection point in the Season 2 finale. The show aims to tackle that head-on in the Season 3 premiere. ""He's still sifting through the results of that meeting, and some of the questions he has about his father, when Russell arrives to pull him out of his funk,” showrunner Elwood Reid said in an interview while previewing the upcoming season. He added,

""They talk through what happened, and it's an interesting scene, because you get to hear the two brothers talk about the different ways they feel about [the night their father died] and what they still carry with them. And then, of course, a case jumps off, and that conversation about their family continues through the rest of the episode in an exciting way.""

The show will continue to explore this mystery and the fallout from Ashton's death. “What was the father involved in — we're going to answer that — and how much do you blame your mother for her actions?” teased Reid. Tracker returns on CBS on Sunday, October 19 at 8 p.m. ET. The season premiere was written by the showrunner and directed by Ken Olin.

A$AP Rocky has never been one to hold back his opinions, and his latest comments about therapy are no exception. The rapper recently shared his controversial perspective on mental health treatment, comparing professional counseling to fortune-telling while discussing his growing family with Rihanna.

During a candid conversation with Elle magazine, the Harlem artist expressed deep pessimism about traditional therapy approaches. Rocky doesn't mince words when explaining his resistance to professional counseling.

“My outlook on therapy is so pessimistic, it's not even funny,” Rocky admitted. “I might get killed for this, but I put therapists in the same box as psychic readings.”

His skepticism stems from what he sees as a fundamental disconnect between therapists and their clients. Rocky questions whether meaningful progress can occur when counselors haven't walked in their patients' shoes.

The rapper's concerns center on trust and shared experience. He struggles with the idea of opening up to strangers who may not understand his background or circumstances. This perspective reflects broader conversations about cultural barriers in mental health treatment.

Rocky's stance highlights ongoing challenges within communities where seeking professional help carries stigma. His comments have sparked discussions about alternative approaches to emotional wellness and support systems.

Despite rejecting traditional therapy, Rocky acknowledges the value of informal support networks. He specifically praised Jay-Z for serving as a trusted confidant within the hip-hop community.

“I think Jay-Z is a Black therapist,” Rocky explained. “A lot of people come to him with their problems.”

This observation points to the mentorship roles that established artists often play in the music industry. Jay-Z's reputation as an advisor and problem-solver has become legendary among his peers.

The comment suggests that Rocky values counseling when it comes from someone who understands his world. Peer support and mentorship within the entertainment industry often fill gaps left by traditional mental health services.

Rocky's personal life tells a different story of growth and contentment. The rapper is embracing his role as a father while preparing for his third child with global superstar Rihanna.

The couple already shares two sons: RZA and Riot. As they await their third child's arrival, Rocky has expressed strong hopes for a daughter this time around.

“I hope it's a girl. I really do. We're praying for a girl,” Rocky shared enthusiastically. The rapper noted distinct differences in Rihanna's current pregnancy compared to her previous experiences.

Rocky's excitement about potentially welcoming a daughter was evident throughout the interview. He believes the pregnancy's unique characteristics might indicate they're expecting a girl.

Rihanna has also voiced her desire for a daughter while expressing love for her boys. During a separate interview with Extra, the singer maintained suspense around the baby's gender while acknowledging widespread speculation.

“I've always wanted a girl,” Rihanna admitted. “God knows best, right? And I love my boys.”

The singer confirmed that her unborn baby's name will begin with the letter R, continuing the family tradition. This consistency reflects the couple's thoughtful approach to building their family identity.

As Rocky approaches middle age, he's demonstrating remarkable acceptance of life's changes. The rapper views his upcoming milestone birthday with enthusiasm rather than dread.

“I'm about to be 40 in a few years. I'm ready to embrace that,” Rocky declared. “I got these pretty gray hairs growing. I'm ready.”

This acceptance extends beyond physical changes to encompass gratitude for his circumstances. Rocky recognizes how fortunate he is to have achieved success while building a stable family life.

The rapper's contentment reflects a man comfortable with his achievements and eager for the next chapter. His perspective suggests that personal fulfillment sometimes comes from unexpected sources – not necessarily traditional therapy, but from family, mentorship, and self-acceptance.

Rocky's journey illustrates how different people find healing and growth through various paths. While his therapy views remain controversial, his commitment to family and personal development continues evolving.

Karoline Leavitt is determined to get to the bottom of Escalatorgate.

The White House Press Secretary is demanding answers about a malfunctioning escalator and teleprompter that stole the show during President Donald Trump's big speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday.

Trump, 79, and first lady Melania, 55, were forced to walk up the escalator at the UN Headquarters in New York after it stopped moving shortly after they stepped on. The teleprompter also stopped working as Trump took the podium, prompting the president to read his remarks from a printout.

Fox News host Jesse Watters, along with several other conservatives, decried the incidents as “sabotage.”

“Well, Jesse, that's definitely what it appears to be to me,” Leavitt told the host on Jesse Watters Primetime.

“First it was the escalator, then it was the teleprompter, and then Katie Pavlich from Townhall… noticed that the audio inside of the room was much lower and different for the president of the United States than the previous speaker,” she went on, arguing that “when you put all of this together, it doesn't look like a coincidence.”

Leavitt said the Secret Service was already looking into the matter.

“If we find that these were UN staffers who were purposefully trying to trip up—literally trip up—the president and the first lady of the United States. Well, there better be accountability for those people, and I will personally see to it,” she concluded.

Watters similarly branded the incident “an insurrection” and joked that “what we need to do is either leave the UN or we need to bomb it.”

Earlier in the day, Leavitt posted on X a portion of a story from The Sunday Times that read, “UN staff members have joked that they may turn off the escalators and elevators and simply tell [Trump] they ran out of money, so he has to walk up the stairs.”

If someone at the UN intentionally stopped the escalator as the President and First Lady were stepping on, they need to be fired and investigated immediately.The Times reported this on Sunday.👇 pic.twitter.com/NitsWbGYG0

But the answer might already be under the noses of Trump officials. 

A source told the Daily Beast that someone in the president's own entourage accidentally triggered the emergency stop.

The UN appeared to confirm as much in a statement clarifying that “a videographer from the U.S. delegation” stepped on the escalator ahead of Trump and Melania.

“A subsequent investigation, including a readout of the machine's central processing unit, indicated that the escalator had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step was triggered at the top of the escalator,” it said. “The videographer may have inadvertently triggered the safety function.”

The source also told the Daily Beast that delegations were allowed to bring their own laptops and teleprompter operators, and that the UN was not running it during Trump's speech. It was suggested that Trump's team did not arrive early enough to ensure their equipment was properly set up.

Trump made sure the world knew about the minor inconveniences he had to endure.

“These are the two things I got from the United Nations: a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter,” he said during his speech.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","AI Bet Means Big Upside for IREN","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/24/bitcoin-miner-iren-has-80-potential-upside-thanks-to-big-bet-on-ai-cloud-bernstein","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 13:30:19 GMT","

IREN (IREN), one of the largest self-operated BTC$113,634.57 miners in the U.S., is breaking away from the pack, and Wall Street is taking notice.

Bernstein analysts raised their price target on IREN to $75 from $20, implying about 80% upside, as the miner doubles down on building its own AI cloud business rather than relying on co-location deals with partners like CoreWeave (CRWV).

IREN has already had a major move, ahead more than eight-fold from its 52-week low of $5.13 hit in April. The shares are higher by 365% year-over-year.

The broker now sees IREN's AI pivot as credible, despite early skepticism about the miner's ability to execute on a capital-intensive data center build-out and compete with AI cloud players tied to hyperscalers and Nvidia (NVDA).

IREN is guiding for rapid growth, the report noted, with $500 million in annual recurring revenue by Q1 2026 on 23,300 GPUs, up from roughly $14 million in Q1 2025.

Beyond AI, IREN retains flexibility with its 3 gigawatt (GW) power portfolio, balancing bitcoin mining and AI workloads to maximize revenue per megawatt, Bernstein analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.

Its 50 EH/s mining operation generates an estimated $600 million in annualized EBITDA at current bitcoin prices, funding its AI expansion, according to the analysts.

Bernstein has shifted its valuation approach to a sum-of-parts model, assigning 87% of enterprise value to AI cloud and co-location potential at IREN's 2GW West Texas site, with the remaining 13% coming from bitcoin mining. 

At the revised target, IREN would trade at $7.5 million per megawatt (MW), above other AI-focused miners but still far below established data center peers like CoreWeave, suggesting further room for multiple expansion, the report added.

The location of Cleopatra's burial has remained a mystery since her death, but a sunken port might be a key to finding it.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Cleopatra VII was the last pharaoh to ever ascend the throne of Egypt. She wielded political power by allying her kingdom with Rome and, at one point, was the richest woman on Earth. She even declared herself the living incarnation of the goddess Isis. But despite her fame and infamy (she allegedly ordered her lover Mark Antony to demand the execution of her own sister), her tomb has never been found.

Rumors of its location have been swirling since Cleopatra's death around two thousand years ago. She and Antony were supposedly buried together after Egypt was defeated by the forces of Augustus Caesar, (with him falling on his sword and her reportedly allowing a deadly asp to take her life), but neither body has ever surfaced. 

That hasn't stopped experts from searching. According to the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, archaeologist and Cleopatra enthusiast Kathleen Martinez (along with her research team) recently discovered a port on the ocean floor that was unmistakably linked to a temple that Martinez believes could hold the body of the infamous queen.

It has long been thought that Cleopatra had been interred somewhere in her birthplace of Alexandria, but Martinez had a different idea. She believes that the queen actually sought her final resting place in a temple of Isis.

Eventually, Martinez and her team investigated the temple of Taposiris Magna—dedicated to Osiris, husband of Isis and king of the Egyptian pantheon. Built by pharaoh Ptolemy II Philadelphus (an ancestor of Cleopatra) between 280 and 270 B.C.E., it used to be a grand temple, but over time, Taposiris Magna has been reduced to crumbling walls and eroded monuments rising out of the sand. And it was there that Martinez and her team found their port, which just so happened to be underwater.

Thousands of years ago, the port stood firmly on land. The coastline was four kilometers (about 2.5 miles) further out during Cleopatra's time, but today, it has encroached to the point that the port is in a much more waterlogged state than it would have been upon construction. Among the remains of the port were columns, cemented blocks, and polished stone floors. The seafloor was littered with anchors and amphora.Martinez had previously explored a subterranean tunnel that led from Taposiris Magna to the Mediterranean Sea, which ended in a group of structures her team refers to as Salam 5. The sunken port is an extension of that, and adds to the trove of objects previously unearthed at Taposiris Magna. Prior finds include coins stamped with Cleopatra's profile, bronze statuettes, oil lamps, ceramic vessels used in rituals, and limestone vessels for storage. A scarab amulet inscribed with The justice of Ra shines appears to be a royal talisman. (If the tomb of the iconic queen is ever found, it could possibly dull the shine of King Tut's cache of gilded treasures.)

Whether the tomb of Cleopatra could have also have ended up submerged is still unknown, and its location still eludes Martinez. But she is determined to keep searching.

In an experiment with 129 women, researchers discovered that foodie Instagram content lifted mood while clean eating posts failed to do so and hinted at subtle risks for body satisfaction.

Study: Food and mood: how clean eating content on social media influences affect and body satisfaction in women. Image credit: 9919/Shutterstock.com

A recent study in Frontiers in Psychology compared the impact of social media content on clean eating vs eating-related control content (foodie) on its effect, body satisfaction, and food choices in a behavioral task.

Spending more time on social media has been associated with lower body satisfaction and disordered eating among users. Instagram, a popular picture-based social media outlet, is used by more than 28% of global internet users. Recently, researchers have started to assess the impact of food- and eating-related social media posts on individuals' perceptions of their bodies and eating behaviors.

Social media users share eating-related content by posting nutritional tips, food photography, and eating videos. A previous study presented an association between viewing eating-related content and eating disorder symptoms, and negative body image.

Clean eating (CE) is an eating-related trend with thousands of Instagram posts containing the hashtags #healthyfood and #healthylifestyle. Although there is no universal definition of CE, it is commonly described as an eating behavior characterized by a higher intake of non-processed foods. The concept of CE aligns with avoiding food considered “bad” (e.g., refined sugar and alcohol) and encouraging “good” (e.g., fruits and vegetables) with a strict diet.

Although the concept of CE could initially benefit health, restricting the variety and quantity of food may lead to disordered eating and promote a negative body image. Social media content has been found to trigger body dissatisfaction and appearance-ideal internalization, particularly among females between 18 and 30 years of age. Women between 17 and 55 years of age, who followed CE recommendations, were more likely to develop restrictive eating behavior, commonly in the form of orthorexia nervosa.

In addition to CE, food content has also increased on Instagram, showcasing what people eat and cook, and often uses hashtags such as #foodporn. Not many studies have investigated the impact of consuming food-related content on body satisfaction and mood. Considering the high volume of social media content related to food, it is essential to understand how it affects an individual's mood, body satisfaction, and behavior.

The current randomized study employed a 2 × 2 design (profile: clean eating vs. foodie; between-subjects factor) × 2 (time: pre-post; within-subjects factor). It assessed the impact of exposure to CE and foodie content on Instagram. The current study hypothesized that viewing CE Instagram profiles would enhance negative affect (NA) and decrease positive affect (PA) and body satisfaction, compared to viewing control content; that CE would lead to healthier snack choices; and that participants with higher baseline vulnerabilities (eating disorder or orthorexia symptoms, body dissatisfaction) would react more strongly.

Female students from the University of Konstanz, primarily from the psychology department, were enrolled to evaluate PA and NA before and after exposure to content from two profiles: CE and control (foodie content) created on Instagram for this study. Each Instagram profile contained 16 posts and was comparable in terms of interaction and number of followers. These accounts were not accessible outside the study.

Any participant with substance dependence, the presence of severe depressive symptoms, a BMI lower than 17 or higher than 30, or those with suicidal tendency were excluded. Eligible participants completed a pre-questionnaire and were randomly assigned to two experimental conditions. After viewing the profile, participants were asked to complete the post-questionnaire. Subsequently, they were asked to select a snack from various foods.

Orthorexic behavior was assessed using the Düsseldorf Orthorexia Scale (DOS), while the Body Image States Scale (BISS) was used to determine an individual's self-evaluation of their physical appearance. These trait measures were used as moderators, not as outcomes.

A total of 129 women (CE-64 and Control-65) fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Participants of both groups were of similar age, body mass index (BMI), eating disorder symptoms, orthorexia symptoms, or general psychopathology. The CE and control groups exhibited similar hunger ratings and time since their last meal.

No significant PA on profile exposure was observed. However, a significant effect of time was observed, with a reduction in PA from before to after exposure across the group. A significant interaction of time × profile was found regarding NA. A significant reduction in NA was observed from pre- to post-measurement when participants viewed the control profile. However, no significant changes were noted in participants after viewing the CE profile. This suggests foodie content may have a protective effect on mood, whereas CE content maintained negative affect.

A higher BISS score indicates lower body satisfaction. Interestingly, an interaction effect between profile and time was observed, but simple tests showed no clear changes within either group. Thus, while no significant body satisfaction changes were confirmed, there was tentative evidence that CE exposure may contribute to lower body satisfaction. Notably, this effect appeared even though no bodies were shown in the posts, suggesting that “healthy lifestyle” food content alone may influence body image.

In the CE group, only 20.31% of the participants selected a healthy food, while the majority chose a high-calorie snack, with two participants declining any snack. Similarly, only 25% of the participants from the foodie group selected a healthy food, while the majority chose high-calorie snacks.

Regression analyses showed that pre-existing vulnerabilities (orthorexia symptoms, eating disorder symptoms, or body dissatisfaction) did not predict stronger reactions to CE content, contrary to the hypothesis.

The current study highlighted the short-term effects of one-time consumption of CE content on social media. Neither CE nor control profile exposure impacted food choice, and body satisfaction effects were inconclusive but showed tentative signals of harm for CE. However, it is not conclusive whether social media content increases the risk of eating disorders or orthorexia symptoms.

Importantly, foodie content reduced negative affect, suggesting that food-enjoyment-focused posts have a protective effect on mood compared to health-restrictive content. Future research must systematically validate this study's findings, especially with longer exposure times and more diverse samples.

The popular Netflix show hits the big screen in a film featuring Laila Lockhart Kraner in the titular role and Kristen Wiig and Gloria Estefan in key supporting parts.


							By 

	Frank Scheck



	There are animated movies for kids, and then there are animated movies for kids. 


Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie is definitely the latter, skewing to the pre-teen demographic that has made the Netflix series that spawned it a hit (11 seasons, 76 episodes). Nothing wrong with that, of course, and if you happen to have some tykes that need big-screen babysitting, well, they'll probably have a swell time. Just keep in mind that, other than the presence of Kristen Wiig, there's precious little on offer for anyone who doesn't drink beverages from a sippy cup.

The Bottom Line

	
	If you can read this, you're too old for this movie.
	



Release date: Friday, September 27Cast: Laila Lockhart Kraner, Kristen Wiig, Gloria Estefan, Thomas Lennon, Jason Mantzoukas, Ego Nwodim, Kyle Mooney, Melissa Villasenor, Fortune FeimsterDirector: Ryan CregoScreenwriters: Mike Lew, Rehana Lew Mirzer, Adam Wilson, Melanie Wilson LaBracio

									Rated G,
								1 hour 38 minutes			






	This live-action/animation hybrid revolves around the titular character, played in both human and animated form by Laila Lockhart Kraner (repeating her role from the series, as is the case with many members of the cast). As you may have deduced from the title, Gabby possesses a special dollhouse, made for her by her loving grandmother Gigi (Gloria Estefan), inside of which are a collection of miniature cats who come to life. Gabby has the power to also miniaturize herself at will, by pinching her ears and launching into “The Pinch Pinch Song.”


	“It's time to get tiny!” Gabby perkily announces, sounding like a motivational coach at a weight-loss seminar.


	The story is set in motion when Gabby joins her grandmother in her van — specially designed to look like a cat and dubbed the “Kitty Wagon” — on a road trip to “Cat Francisco,” which looks pretty much like San Francisco except that the Golden Gate Bridge is a bright pink (actually, not a bad idea). Unfortunately, her beloved dollhouse and its denizens accidentally wind up careening down the street and falling into the hands of Vera (Wiig), for whom the term “cat lady” might have been invented. She's forever accompanied by her pet feline Marlena, who's dressed identically to her. She's apparently also a successful businesswoman, having invented “Pretty Glitter Kitty Litter,” which is exactly what it sounds like.

	











	Gabby thus has to rescue her furry animated friends while encountering some new characters along the way, including Chumley (Jason Mantzoukas), a stuffed animal who, we eventually learn, resents Vera because she stopped playing with him. (Now there's a valuable lesson for your children: Play with your stuffed animals, or else suffer the consequences!).


	That's about all of the plot I could follow between frequent naps which were rudely interrupted by the many kiddos in attendance singing and clapping along to the action on the screen. What you should know in advance is that Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie, like the series, is interactive, so expect your children to get giddily excited during the screening. You might want to maintain a limit on their sugary snacks.


	Speaking of sugary snacks, that's pretty much the best way to describe the movie, which offers some mild life lessons along the way but is mostly a silly diversion featuring lots of peppy pop songs and far too many painful cat puns. Gabby frequently breaks the fourth wall, delivering such important advice as “You're never too old to play.” At one point, she also instructs us to hold hands with those sitting next to us. But as a grown man there by myself, it might have resulted in me getting ejected from the theater.  


	It's all harmless fun, other than the fact that parents will undoubtedly be forced to shell out money for cat ears for their children. Kraner is a suitably likeable presence and Estefan provides the requisite warmth as the grandmother. The voice performers — including Thomas Lennon, Kyle Mooney, Melissa Villasenor, and Fortune Feimster — are superior to the rudimentary computer animation that probably works better on the small screen. And Wiig, God bless her, gives it her comedic all.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Former FBI Director Comey expected to be indicted soon in Virginia federal court: MSNBC","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/24/james-comey-fbi-indictment-trump-congress.html","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 19:45:23 GMT","



Former FBI Director James Comey is expected to be indicted on criminal charges in the coming days in federal court in Virginia, MSNBC reported Wednesday.

The news comes days after the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia resigned under pressure from President Donald Trump after opposing the filing of charges against Comey.

Comey for years has been a target of Trump's ire. 

The president, in a social media post on Saturday, called Comey ""guilty as hell"" as he raged about the lack of criminal charges against the former FBI leader.

MSNBC reporter Ken Dilanian, in a post on X, said Comey is expected to be indicted in the Eastern District of Virginia, according to three people familiar with the matter.

""The full extent of the charges being prepared against Comey is unclear, but the sources believe that at least one element of the indictment — if it goes forward -- will accuse him of lying to Congress during his testimony on September 30, 2020 about whether he authorized a leak of information,"" Dilanian tweeted.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that day had asked Comey if he lied when he said he did not, as FBI director, authorize a leak of information to The Wall Street Journal for an October 2016 article about a Justice Department probe of then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's email use.

Dilanian, who reported Wednesday's story with his MSNBC colleague Carol Leonnig, noted that the five-year statute of limitations on that charge would lapse next Tuesday.

Cruz, in a December 2020 letter to the Justice Department, wrote that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe had admitted knowing about and authorizing the leak. 

Cruz wrote that while McCabe has insisted that Comey was aware of his decision to authorize the disclosure, Comey ""has denied this claim.""

In May 2017 testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Comey had said he ""never"" had been an anonymous source in news reports about probes involving Trump or Clinton, and that he had not authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source.

In his September 2020, testimony, Comey said he stood by that answer.

""Mr. Comey and Mr. McCabe's statements are irreconcilably contradictory,"" Cruz wrote to the Justice Department. ""Mr. McCabe says that he told Mr. Comey of the leak and that Mr. Comey approved—effectively authorizing the leak after the fact. Mr. Comey, on the other hand, has said that he neither authorized the leak nor knew of Mr. McCabe's involvement.""

""One of them is lying under oath—a federal crime,"" Cruz wrote.

CNBC has requested comment from Comey through his book publisher.

Trump, in a Truth Social post on Saturday that was aimed at Attorney General Pam Bondi, said that  Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-California, are ""all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to get done.""

""Then we almost put in a Democrat supported U.S. Attorney, in Virginia, with a really bad Republican past. A Woke RINO, who was never going to do his job,"" Trump wrote, referring to acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Erik Siebert, who resigned Friday.

""That's why two of the worst Dem Senators PUSHED him so hard. He even lied to the media and said he quit, and that we had no case,"" wrote, Trump, who had put Sierbert into the job.

""No, I fired him, and there is a GREAT CASE, and many lawyers, and legal pundits, say so. Lindsey Halligan is a really good lawyer, and likes you, a lot. We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!! President DJT.""

Maria Branyas Morera had been verified as the oldest living person when she died last year at age 117.Credit: Xavier Dengra (Public Domain)

Maria Branyas Morera lived to the age of 117 with a bit of genetic luck and a healthy diet that included daily yogurts, according to a study published today in Cell Reports Medicine1. During her final year — she died on 19 August 2024 — she was verified as the oldest living person, a feat that drew the attention of researchers who explore the biology of ageing.

“We wanted to learn from her particular case to benefit other people,” says Manel Esteller, a physician specializing in genetics at the University of Barcelona in Spain.

What's the secret to living to 100? Centenarian stem cells could offer clues

At the time, Branyas was living in the small town of Olot, in the Catalonia region of Spain, where she enjoyed reading books, playing with dogs and spending time with friends and family, including her two daughters — each in their 90s. Over several encounters with Branyas and her family, Esteller and his colleagues collected samples of her blood, saliva, urine and stool that provided insights into her unique physiology, including her genetics, metabolism and gut microbiome.

The supercentenarian was happy to collaborate. “She was a very humble person,” Esteller recalls. “She said: ‘My only merit is that I'm alive'.”

The researchers compared Branyas's genetic, metabolomic and other profiles with those of women of various ages living in the same region. One of the main insights from the work, Esteller says, is that it is possible to distinguish molecular changes that happen in the body because of ageing from those that occur because of poor health.

For instance, the research team learnt that Branyas's telomeres — the stretches of repetitive DNA that protect the ends of chromosomes — were exceptionally short. Telomeres naturally shorten with age, and unusually short telomeres have been associated with age-related diseases. But Branyas had no such illnesses. “This is telling us that the loss of telomeres is not necessarily associated with disease, it's simply associated with being old,” Esteller says.

Mayana Zatz, a geneticist at the University of São Paulo in Brazil who studies the genetics of healthy centenarians, says the study is thorough but notes that conclusions that are based on a single individual are limited. “It would be interesting to compare the findings with supercentenarians in other populations,” she says.

Chelsea have been informed that a Real Madrid superstar could now be tempted to join them.

Enzo Maresca's side edged past League One minnows Lincoln City by the skin of their teeth on Tuesday night, despite fielding a largely strong side including a host of senior stars.

Rob Street's deserved Lincoln opener just before half-time threatened to knock Chelsea out of the Carabao Cup in very early and humbling fashion, but Maresca was rescued by an excellent strike from Tyrique George and a second goal from summer signing Facundo Buonanotte just minutes later.

The 2-1 win was a nervy one, and it perhaps encapsulates why Chelsea are far from the end product, even after a busy summer transfer window.

Cole Palmer's reoccurring groin problem is a major worry for Chelsea given just how reliant they currently are on the England star's undoubted match-winning quality, with their botched deal for attacking midfield alternative Xavi Simons threatening to haunt Maresca.

 Some reports are claiming that a new problem in that same groin for Palmer means that he faces several weeks out (Simon Phillips), and you can make a case that Bunonanottte isn't at the level required to replace the ex-Man City star on a regular basis.

Estimated games Cole Palmer could miss after reported new groin injury

Lincoln City (A) - EFL Cup

 Brighton (H) - Premier League

 Benfica (H) - Champions League

 Liverpool (H) - Premier League

 Nottingham Forest (A) - Premier League

 Ajax (H) - Champions League

 Sunderland (H) - Premier League

 Tottenham (A) - Premier League

Maresca also wanted a new goalkeeper and centre-back in the summer window (Simon Phillips), amid doubts surrounding the suitability of Robert Sanchez as number one, which were made all the more prevalent by his sending off against Man United last weekend.

Chelsea are expected to go back in for Mike Maignan on a potential pre-contract after failing to strike a deal in the summer, while the Blues are also actively looking at central defensive options.

Maresca is light in that area right now, with the Italian complaining that he's unable to rest key defenders. The consensus is that they also need to bring in a world-class, experienced centre-half to stable the ship, if Chelsea are serious about challenging for the Premier League title.

Even with their glaring defensive needs, journalist Graeme Bailey has now told TBR Football that an audacious move for Real Madrid superstar Vinícius Jr is on the cards for 2026.

 The Brazil international kissed Real's badge after his goal in their 4-1 La Liga win over Levante on Tuesday, but behind-closed-doors, things are proving far more complicated.

There is apparent ""frustration"" aimed at Alonso over Vinicius' role in the squad, and talks over a new deal have stalled due to extortionate wage demands as his contract ticks down towards expiry in 2027.

Real have apparently been clear to the 25-year-old - agree a new contract by next summer or be sold.

According to Bailey, Chelsea have been informed that Vinicius could be open to a Premier League move if they give him the opportunity, and sources are ""insisting"" that the winger's exit is indeed a possibility.

“Florentino Perez loves Vinicius Junior but there are concerns within the club about whether he is going to sign this new deal,"" Bailey said.

“It is hard to imagine Vinicius not being at Madrid but sources are insisting this possibility.

“The coming months are going to be intriguing but the basic point is that Real won't allow him to go into the final 12 months of his deal and potentially look at a free transfer.”

He has commanded a mammoth price tag in recent years, but by the time next summer rolls around, Vinicius will have just one year remaining on his deal. That would put Perez in a very vulnerable position, and the Los Blancos chief could be forced to sell for a lesser fee.

In terms of whether Chelsea should capitalise on this, Vinicius is one of those special players you build a team around, and the South American could help to ease the burden on Palmer's shoulders as Maresca's standout creative force.

Of course, Chelsea would face major competition, with Arsenal, PSG, Bayern and Liverpool named as other suitors, so it would still be far from easy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Judge says Justice Department officials may have violated order not to post opinions about prosecuting Luigi Mangione","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/24/politics/mangione-doj-judge-justice-department-officials","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 19:37:24 GMT","


            A federal judge said two high-level Justice Department employees may have violated her order limiting public opinions about the prosecution of accused killer Luigi Mangione by reposting President Donald Trump's statements about the case on X.
    


            Judge Margaret Garnett ordered the Justice Department to respond by the end of next week and explain how the apparent violations happened. Garnett said if there are further violations of her order it could result in sanctions, including fines, contempt of court findings or actions specific to the case.
    


            The judge also said she would consider Trump's comments separately when she considers a motion challenging prosecutors' decision to seek the death penalty.
    


            A spokeswoman for DOJ declined to comment.
    


            Lawyers for Mangione brought the X posts to the judge's attention in a letter filed late Tuesday night arguing the statements are prejudicing the 27-year-old's right to a fair trial. Mangione is facing federal murder and other charges for allegedly fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last year.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi has said the Justice Department will seek the death penalty. Mangione, who is also facing state murder charges, has pleaded not guilty.
    


            “The Government has indelibly prejudiced Mr. Mangione by baselessly linking him to unrelated violent events, and left-wing extremist groups, despite there being no connection or affiliation,” his lawyers wrote to the judge.
    


            Mangione's lawyers said the troubling posts involve reposts of a clip of Trump's interview on Fox News when he stated Mangione “shot someone in the back as clear as you're looking at me.” A White House-related account posted a clip of the interview. It was reposted by the deputy director of DOJ's public affairs unit, who works for Bondi and who added, “@POTUS is absolutely right.” The following day his post was reposted by the chief of staff to the deputy attorney general.
    


            By Wednesday morning, Garnett, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, responded. “The statements referenced in the September 23 Letter by two high-ranking staff members of the Department of Justice, including within the Office of Attorney General, appear to be in direct violation of this Rule and the Court's April 25 Order,” the judge wrote.
    


            In April, the judge ordered the attorneys to follow a local rule that says parties to a criminal case shouldn't make public opinions about the case that could interfere with a fair trial.
    


            Mangione's lawyers also raised statements by White House officials, including press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who called Mangione a “left-wing assassin,” and deputy White House chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, who said on Fox News that Mangione is an “anti-fascist.”
    


            The judge said she would consider those statements when she weighs Mangione's motion challenging the death penalty and seeking to dismiss the indictment, arguing the public perp walk and Bondi's statements violated his constitutional rights.

Key developments on Sept. 24:

Russia launched an attack on a Ukrainian Ground Forces training ground on Sept. 24, including two Iskander ballistic missiles, causing casualties among personnel, the military reported.

Despite security precautions, a direct hit against a shelter made it impossible to fully prevent casualties, according to the military.""The relevant emergency services are working at the scene. The injured personnel are receiving all necessary medical assistance,"" the statement said.

The Ukrainian Ground Forces did not disclose the location of the strike.

The military added that efforts are ongoing to fortify training centers, ranges, and other military infrastructure with reinforced shelters to reduce casualties from continued Russian attacks.

Russian forces have repeatedly targeted Ukrainian training grounds, including sites far from the front lines. These strikes have raised concerns over the safety of personnel and the preparedness of protective measures at rear-area facilities.

Ukraine carried out strikes on multiple targets in Russia linked to oil refining and drone production, Ukraine's General Staff confirmed on Sept. 24.

The General Staff said the strike hit the Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat petrochemical plant in the Republic of Bashkortostan, specifically the ELOU-AVT-6 primary oil refining unit. Preliminary reports indicate the attack caused a fire at the site.

The targeted facility processes up to 10 million tons of oil annually and is a key producer of liquid rocket fuel for Russia, according to the General Staff.

In addition to the strike on the oil refinery in the Republic of Bashkortostan, Ukrainian forces also targeted key infrastructure sites involved in the country's energy and defense sectors.

The Kuzmichi-1 oil pumping station, part of the crude oil transport network supplying Russia's southern regions, was among the facilities hit. Another strike targeted the Zenzevatka pumping station, which services the Kuybyshev-Tikhoretsk main oil pipeline.

Ukrainian forces struck a drone production facility in the village of Valuyki in Russia's Belgorod Oblast as well. While the full extent of the damage is still being assessed, a fire reportedly broke out at the site following the attack.

Ukraine's General Staff also confirmed that a long-range strike on Sept. 22 targeted the Astrakhan gas processing plant in southern Russia, forcing a partial shutdown of operations.

The facility, located in Russia's Astrakhan Oblast, is one of the world's largest gas chemical complexes and the country's primary producer of sulfur used in explosives, accounting for up to 66% of national output. The plant processes up to 3.2 million tons of oil products annually, according to the General Staff.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

Russia's parliament passed a bill in the first reading on Sept. 24 that would introduce year-round conscription, replacing spring and fall draft cycles, pro-government outlet Kommersant reported.

While conscripts are officially barred from being deployed abroad, reports indicate that many are pressured into signing contracts with Russia's Defense Ministry and sent to fight in Ukraine.

The bill would overhaul the existing system by allowing enlistment offices to conduct medical exams, psychological screenings, and draft board sessions throughout the year.

Under the proposed system, draft notices would be issued year-round.

The reform is meant to ease pressure on military commissariats, according to Andrei Kartapolov, chairman of the parliament's Defense Committee and the bill's author.

Russia drafts young men twice a year for one year of compulsory service.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's partial mobilization in 2022, the first since World War II, triggered protests across Russia and a mass exodus of more than 261,000 men.

Although the Kremlin declared mobilization ""completed,"" it has never been officially ended by a decree.

Russian forces took an underage girl hostage to use her as a human shield after murdering her parents in a front-line village in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian 3rd Army Corps reported on Sept. 24.

The civilians were killed in the area of responsibility of the 3rd Army Corps, in the village of Shandryholove in Donetsk Oblast.

Ukrainian authorities have documented a number of cases of Russian troops murdering civilians in front-line areas since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, part of a wider pattern of abuse and repression.

""Russia is using (the captured girl) as a human shield for its unit advancing in the Lyman sector,"" the military unit said.

Even before the assault on the settlement, a Russian commander with the callsign ""Bali"" reportedly ordered his troops to ""kill everyone indiscriminately,"" including the civilian population, ""except for the children.""

A video released by the 3rd Corps shows aerial footage of Russian troops taking the girl hostage, and includes intercepted audio of the Russian commander's orders.

A Russian unit broke into a house and killed the girl's parents before abducting her. She was then held hostage to prevent Ukrainian troops from opening fire during the ongoing battle, according to the military.

""All radio intercepts confirm that Russian actions were premeditated,"" the statement read.

Murdering civilians and using them as human shields constitutes a war crime under the Geneva Conventions.

Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine's former commander-in-chief, offered his first public assessment of Ukraine's 2024 cross-border operation in Russia's Kursk Oblast in an op-ed for the Ukrainian news outlet Mirror of the Week on Sept. 24.

""I don't know the cost of such actions, but it is clear that it was too high,"" he said.

Ukraine launched the unprecedented incursion in August 2024, advancing into Russian territory and seizing 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) within the first months.

The operation, planned by Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, sought to divert Russian troops from eastern Ukraine and disrupt Moscow's plans to invade Sumy Oblast, which borders Kursk Oblast.

Russia, reinforced by around 12,000 North Korean troops, launched a counter-offensive this spring that later forced Ukraine out of most of the captured Russian territory.

Zaluzhnyi, the current ambassador to the U.K., said that limited incursions can be undertaken, but practice showed they often failed to deliver long-term success.

""Practice has shown that, ultimately, an isolated tactical breakthrough on a narrow section of the front does not bring the necessary success to the attacking side,"" he wrote.

The former military chief added that Russia's forces had managed to leverage ""technological and tactical advantages"" to blunt Ukraine's gains and later counterattack.

Zaluzhnyi's comments contrast with Syrskyi's, who has consistently emphasized heavy Russian losses as the primary achievement of the Kursk campaign.

Construction continues at the Lithium Nevada Corp. mine site Tracker Pass project on April 24, 2023, near Orovada, NevRick Bowmer/The Associated Press

U.S.-listed shares of Lithium Americas (LAC-N, LAC-T) jumped 93.5 per cent on Wednesday after it was reported that the Trump administration is seeking up to a 10 per cent stake in the miner, in the latest sign of Washington's intervention into industries it considers critical to national security.

Late Tuesday, Reuters cited two people familiar with the talks who said the administration is considering the stake as part of negotiations over a US$2.26-billion Department of Energy loan for the company's Thacker Pass lithium project in Nevada, the largest planned lithium mine in the Western Hemisphere.

Vancouver-based Lithium Americas said on Wednesday it was in discussions with the U.S. energy department and General Motors over the Thacker Pass loan.

The move underscores President Donald Trump's increasing use of direct government ownership to steer strategic sectors and curb reliance on China, which dominates refining of many critical minerals.

China produces over 40,000 metric tons of lithium annually, ranking third after Australia and Chile, but dominates refining, processing more than 75 per cent of the world's lithium into battery-grade material.

TD Cowen analysts said a government stake would lend credence to the Thacker Pass project completion and expansion to multiple phases with perhaps enhanced economics.

The project is seen as a linchpin in building a domestic supply chain part of Washington's long-standing drive to boost U.S. production of lithium, a metal used to make batteries for electric vehicles and other electronics.

The Trump administration recently moved to take a stake in chipmaker Intel following a deal that would make the Department of Defense the largest shareholder in rare earths MP Materials. Jefferies said the administration's preference for equity stakes, viewed as lower political cost than tax increases, can support financing, corporate profits, and favorable returns on invested capital.

Lithium Americas' Canadian and U.S.-listed shares were both up about 90 per cent at $8.04 and US$5.80, respectively. The company had a market value of US$744.5-million as of last close on the New York Stock Exchange.

GM, which invested US$625-million in the mine last year for a 38 per cent stake, has the right to buy all of the project's lithium from its first phase and a portion from the second phase for 20 years, although Trump officials are now seeking a guarantee that GM will buy the metal, according to the sources.

NBCFM Research analyst Mohamed Sidibe said the MP Materials-DoD model shows how government equity, long-term offtake, and price support can derisk strategic projects.

He added for Lithium Americas, a similar approach could strengthen funding and project durability, though it may dilute existing shareholders.

The Thacker Pass project is expected to begin production in 2028.

Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein said an equity stake could include offtake price guarantees, potentially making Thacker Pass profitable even if lithium prices remain lower for longer.

The news also lifted other lithium miners in premarket trading. Albemarle gained 5.5 per cent while Sigma Lithium climbed 9 per cent. U.S.-listed shares of SQM rose 3.3 per cent.

The first phase of BMO Field's FIFA World Cup makeover is now complete, with four huge video screens at each corner of the ground, a luxury lounge to accommodate heads of state and other dignitaries and preparations underway to add 17,000 seats and a new playing surface before next summer's soccer extravaganza.

The City of Toronto, which owns the stadium, and Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, which manages its operations, toured reporters around the stadium Tuesday, describing what has been done and what's still to come.

“We're proud to be welcoming the globe and the world to this stadium and to have some things left behind as a legacy that will improve the fan experience long after the World Cup is over,” said Sharon Bollenbach, executive director of the FIFA World Cup 26 Toronto secretariat.

Although it's normally known as BMO Field, home to Toronto FC of Major League Soccer and the Canadian Football League's Toronto Argos, the venue will be known as Toronto Stadium during the World Cup. 

Canada's men's national team has qualified for the tournament as one of three host nations, along with Mexico and the United States. It will play its first match in Toronto next June. Toronto will play host to six games and Vancouver seven over the course of the tournament, with other games spread across 14 cities in the U.S. and Mexico.

Nick Eaves, chief operating officer of MLSE, said the stadium is now starting Phase 2 of preparations, which he called a “final mile” to being World Cup ready.

The highlight of Phase 1 was the addition of four enormous colour screens, 50 feet by 30 feet, at each corner of the stadium. The screens are capable of displaying more than 5 million pixels, according to the organizers.

“Those are the jewels in the crown, really, for the fan experience. They're so beautiful visually,” Bollenbach said.

The stadium also now features a lounge that includes premium seating where FIFA will be able to welcome heads of state and other dignitaries who will attend the matches. The lounge was created by merging and renovating four existing luxury boxes located between the upper and lower stands on the stadium's west side.

The City of Toronto has pledged $123-million to the stadium improvements while MLSE will contribute $23-million. 

The hybrid grass pitch that is currently in use at BMO Field will have to be replaced ahead of the World Cup, Eaves said. Although the current playing surface is considered a good pitch, he said, FIFA will want to ensure all playing surfaces are as good as they can possibly be.

“It's going to be similar to this. It's a hybrid pitch, which means it's natural grass, but stitched into a base that allows it to be a little bit more durable. So we'll be replacing it with a World Cup match-ready pitch,” he said.

The stadium's lighting will be upgraded to meet FIFA broadcast standards and player locker rooms and dugouts will be enhanced.

The major change still to come in Phase 2 is the addition of 17,000 seats, which will bring the stadium's capacity from about 28,000 to about 45,000 people.

Construction will begin in December to prepare for the installation of 10,000 additional seats on the stadium's north side and 7,000 seats on the south side. Those seats will be temporary and will come down once the tournament is over. But in the north end, a structure will remain in place that will be converted to an outdoor patio where fans will be able to watch games in future.

“In terms of a legacy leave behind that residents of the city Toronto can enjoy long after the World Cup matches are over, that's a great example,” Eaves said.

Phase 1 of the upgrades to BMO Field for the 2026 World Cup is now complete, with the second phase to start in December. The next stage will include increasing seating capacity to 45,000 with 17,000 temporary seats in the north and south end.

Proposed changes are in line with suggestions from the National Association of Manufacturers' “wishlist” sent to Trump.

This story was originally published by The New Lede.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing a rollback of certain Biden-era regulations that determine how the agency evaluates chemicals — a move it says will speed innovation. Critics argue the plan weakens safeguards to protect people from toxic exposures.

The EPA on Monday released proposed changes to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) that would remove amendments made in 2024 under the Biden administration. TSCA is a federal law under which the EPA evaluates chemicals to make sure human and environmental health will be protected before chemicals are put into the marketplace. The proposed changes include removing the 2024 amendment that required the agency to consider every use and exposure route of a chemical when evaluating risk. 

In its explanation, the EPA wrote that the 2024 amendment could “negatively impact EPA's ability to complete risk evaluations in a timely manner” and added that the agency should have discretion in deciding which “conditions of use, exposure routes and exposure pathways it will consider in risk evaluation,” a move that would allow the EPA to exclude some uses of a chemical from its reviews. 

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

This proposed change ignores that people are often exposed to the same chemical from different sources, said Maria Doa, senior director of chemicals policy for the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund. “If you live in a community and there's a facility nearby releasing a chemical into the air … and you are exposed to the same chemical from a product that you use at home, your body doesn't treat these exposures differently,” she said.

“What happens is they would regulate the one use and not the other. But if you look at the combination, they both contribute to your exposure,” Doa added.

Other proposed changes include scaling back how much information manufacturers need to provide for a proposed chemical; considering personal protection and safety equipment use when evaluating workplace chemical risks; and allowing the agency to determine if certain uses of a chemical carry unreasonable risks instead of making a single risk judgment based on all of the chemical's uses — the latter approach negatively impacts technological innovation and businesses, according to the proposed rule change.

Doa said these changes are “all coordinated in order to lower what they characterize as exposures and risk.” 

EPA administrator Lee Zeldin touted the changes as “a clear, predictable, commonsense approach that's grounded in the law and the science” in an accompanying statement. 

“This work is yet another example of how we can and will protect human health and the environment while allowing manufacturing and industrial sectors to thrive,” he said.

The EPA has made multiple environmental rollbacks in the first few months of the Trump administration that appease the industries the agency regulates. The proposed TSCA changes are in line with suggestions from the National Association of Manufacturers' “wishlist” sent to the Trump administration last December. 

Last week, The New Lede reported that top EPA officials are frequently meeting with lobbyists from the chemical, plastic, agricultural and energy industries and mostly shutting out health and environmental groups. 

The findings were based on the calendars of Nancy Beck, the EPA's principal deputy assistant administrator in the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, and Lynn Ann Dekleva, the deputy assistant administrator of the same EPA office. Both previously worked at the American Chemistry Council — which represents chemical manufacturers and praised the proposed changes in a statement. 

“By revisiting provisions that created unnecessary complexity, confusion and uncertainty, EPA is taking steps to ensure that TSCA risk evaluations incorporate the best available and most recent science by adequately considering relevant exposures and condition of use information to inform decision-making,” said Kimberly Wise White, the council's vice president of regulatory and scientific affairs. 

The EPA is accepting public comment on the proposed changes for the next month.

            A top Justice Department official has retracted a letter he sent to an FBI agent who responded to the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre that suggested the agent was being investigated in relation to a defamation lawsuit against Alex Jones.
    


            In a letter to William Aldenberg's attorney last week, President Donald Trump ally Ed Martin implied the agent was being scrutinized because of his role in a major lawsuit led by families of victims that resulted in a $1.4 billion judgment against the conspiracy theorist Jones.
    


            Aldenberg, who was one of the first responders the day of the 2012 elementary school massacre, was a plaintiff in the lawsuit. He and the families testified that they faced years of harassment and threats from those who believed Jones' lies that the shooting, which killed 20 first graders and six adults, was a hoax.
    


            Martin initially told Aldenberg's attorney that he had questions about the agent benefiting financially from the lawsuit and ominously warned that “there are criminal laws protecting the citizens from actions by government employees who may be acting for personal benefit.”
    


            “I encourage you to review those,” Martin wrote, according to a copy of the letter Jones posted on X.



            But in a new letter addressed to attorney Christopher Mattei on Wednesday, Martin withdrew his initial letter entirely.
    


            In a brief note, CNN first reported, Martin wrote that there is no investigation of Aldenberg and “because of this, I hereby withdraw my request for information from you or your former client.”
    


            Martin was ordered by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to retract the letter, according to a person familiar with the matter.
    


            Mattei said he is pleased “this so-called inquiry” has ended.
    


            “Less than 18 hours after calling out Alex Jones and Ed Martin for their corrupt use of the Department of Justice to harass Sandy Hook families and the heroic FBI agent who ran into that school to save any children he could, I am happy to learn that this so-called inquiry has now been withdrawn, if it ever existed at all,” Mattei said in a statement. “Let this be a reminder: this is not a moment to cower in silence, but to stand up to bullying, lawless misconduct. This isn't over.”
    


            After Trump took office, Martin was initially set to be the top US attorney in Washington, but after failing to secure confirmation because the Senate torpedoed his nomination, he was instead given multiple roles inside the Justice Department. He now serves as the director of the department's “Weaponization Working Group.”
    


            The original September 15 letter from Martin, disclosed by Jones on social media, was met with derision from the families and the FBI agent.
    


            “Thanks to the courage of the Sandy Hook families, Infowars will soon be finished,” Mattei, the attorney for Aldenberg and the families, said in a statement responding to the original letter. “In his last gasps, Jones is once again harassing them, only now with the corrupt complicity of at least one DOJ official. It's as disgusting as it is pathetic, and we will not stand for it.”
    


            Jones posted the original letter on X. The letter does not make any specific allegation or charge behind the investigation.
    


            Martin has not respond to CNN's requests for comment.
    


            “I am writing to request information from you regarding your client FBI Special Agent William Aldenberg and his role in certain litigation that may benefit him personally and that may impact our citizens and our legal system,” the letter to Aldenberg's attorney says. “As you may know, there are criminal laws protecting the citizens from actions by government employees who may be acting for personal benefit. I encourage you to review those.”
    


            Since he joined the Justice Department early in Trump's second turn, Martin has sent several similar letters threatening legal action against the president's perceived enemies or organizations that run counter to his agenda – many of which have been leaked to the public.
    


            In his letter to Mattei, Martin requested he “keep this correspondence confidential” because “I do not wish to litigate this in the media.”
    


            Nevertheless, Jones posted the letter on X, claiming that “The DOJ's Task Force On Government Weaponization Against The American People Has Launched An Investigation Into The Democrat Party / FBI Directing Illegal Law-fare Against Alex Jones And Infowars.”
    


            And earlier this month before the letter was sent, Jones posted a picture of Martin and himself on social media with the caption, “I just had a very important meeting with DOJ strikeforce leader, Ed Martin.”
    


            And this week, Jones on his online show said, “a bunch of other actions are being taken right now. They are gonna be breaking very soon.”

PARIS (AP) — A lifelong fan of “Tomb Raider,” French gamer Romain Bos was on tenterhooks when an update of the popular video game went online in August.

But his excitement quickly turned to anger. 

The gamer's ears — and those of other “Tomb Raider” fans — picked up something amiss with the French-language voice of Lara Croft, the game's protagonist. 

It sounded robotic, lifeless even — shorn of the warmth, grace and believability that French voice actor Françoise Cadol has given to Croft since she started playing the character in 1996.

Gamers and Cadol herself came to the same conclusion: A machine had cloned her voice and replaced her. 

“It's pathetic,” says Cadol, who straight away called her lawyer. “My voice belongs to me. You have no right to do that.” 

“It was absolutely scandalous,” says Bos. “It was artificial intelligence.”

Aspyr, the game developer based in Austin, Texas, didn't respond to e-mailed questions from The Associated Press. But it acknowledged in a post last week on its website that what it described as “unauthorized AI generated content” had been incorporated into its Aug. 14 update of “Tomb Raider IV–VI Remastered” that angered fans.

“We've addressed this issue by removing all AI voiceover content,” Aspyr's post said. “We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.”

Still, the affair has triggered alarms in the voiceover community, with campaigners saying it's a sobering example of dangers that AI poses to human workers and their jobs.




“If we can replace actors, we'll be able to replace accountants, and a whole range of other professions that could also be automated,” says Patrick Kuban, a French-language voice actor who is also a co-president of United Voice Artists, an international federation of voiceover artists.

“So we need to ask ourselves the right questions: How far should we go, and how do we regulate these machines?” 

Hollywood has seen similar concerns, with video game performers striking for 11 months for a new contract this year that included AI guardrails.

“This is happening pretty much everywhere. We're getting alerts from all over the world — from Brazil to Taiwan,” Kuban said in an Associated Press interview.

“Actors' voices are being captured, either to create voice clones — not perfect ones — but for illicit use on social media by individuals, since there are now many apps for making audio deepfakes,” Kuban said.

“These voices are also being used by content producers who aren't necessarily in the same country,” he said. “So it's very difficult for actors to reclaim control over their voices, to block these uses.”

Cadol says that within minutes of the release of the “Tomb Raider” update, her phone began erupting with messages, emails and social media notifications from upset fans.

“I took a look and I saw all this emotion — anger, sadness, confusion. And that's how I found out that my voice had been cloned,” she said in an AP interview.

Cadol says 12 years of recording French-language voiceovers for Lara Croft — from 1996 to 2008 — built an intimate bond with her fans. She calls them the “guardians” of her work.

Once the initial shock subsided, she resolved to fight back. Her Paris lawyer, Jonathan Elkaim, is seeking an apology from Aspyr and financial redress.

In the update, new chunks of voiceover appear to have been added to genuine recordings that Cadol says she made years ago. 

Most notably, fans picked up on one particularly awkward segment. In it, a voice instructs players how to use their game controllers to make Lara Croft climb onto an obstacle, intoning in French: “Place toi devant et appuyez sur avancer” — Stand in front and press ‘advance.'

Not only does it sound clunky but it also rings as grammatically incorrect to French speakers — mixing up the polite and less polite forms of language that they use, depending on who they're addressing. 

Gamers were up in arms. Bos posted a video on his YouTube channel that same evening, lamenting: “It's half Françoise Cadol, half AI. It's horrible ! Why have they done that?”

“I was really disgusted,” the 34-year-old said in an AP interview. “I grew up with Françoise Cadol's voice. I've been a ‘Tomb Raider' fan since I was young kid.”

“Lara Croft is a bit — how should I say — a bit sarcastic at times in some of her lines. And I think Françoise played that very, very well,” he said. 

“That's exactly why now is the time to set boundaries,” he added. “It's so that future generations also have the chance to experience talented actors.”

Families announced legal action against American Airlines and the U.S. government over the Jan. 29 American Eagle Flight 5342 crash near Washington, D.C. (Credit: Pool)

The family of Casey Crafton has filed the first lawsuit over the American Eagle Flight 5342 crash in the Potomac River near Washington, D.C., alleging the disaster was avoidable and caused by systemic negligence.

The Jan. 29 crash involved an Army Black Hawk helicopter that collided midair with an American Airlines passenger plane near Ronald Reagan Washington International Airport, killing 64 people on the American Eagle flight and three aboard the military helicopter.

The federal lawsuit was filed on behalf of Casey Crafton's estate, with his wife Rachel and family leading the legal action.

""Our lives were shattered in a moment,"" said Dailey Crafton, Crafton's brother. ""Casey was betrayed by systemic disregard for safety. We cannot stand by and allow his life to be lost in vain.""

Multiple victims' family members spoke at a news conference Wednesday, accusing the US government and American Airlines of negligence. (POOL)

The lawsuit accuses American Airlines and PSA Airlines of negligence in operations, training, and knowingly allowing dangerous conditions at DCA, noting the crash was predictable and preventable.

American Airlines allegedly ignored repeated near misses and congestion data, prioritizing profit over safety, according to attorneys.

""The crash of American Eagle 5342 was predictable, preventable, and caused the needless loss of 67 lives,"" said attorney Robert Clifford. ""… American ran red lights for years by allowing these planes to operate in congested, unsafe conditions.""

Action will also be brought against the U.S. government, encompassing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the U.S. Army, for systemic failures in oversight, air traffic control and military helicopter procedures.

Attorneys said the FAA failed to provide safe air traffic control and allowed unsafe operational environments, while the Army helicopter crew failed to follow basic ""see and avoid"" flight principles.

""The helicopter crew's conduct was inexcusable,"" said Brian Alexander, an attorney and former Army aviator. ""Air traffic control completely failed in their duty as the lifeguards of our aviation system.""

Before suing the government, families must first file separate Form 95 claims, which attorneys said have already been filed by nearly all the victims' families.

The Crafton case is expected to serve as a guiding complaint for other victims' families, which are expected to be consolidated in federal court.

Doug Lane, who lost his wife, Christine, and son, Spencer, in the crash, said more than 120 family members have banded together to ""become something both beautiful and powerful.""

""We support each other through birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, weddings—that were planned but never held,"" Lane said. ""Little League and figure skating seasons that started with missing coaches, missing competitors, and missing parents in the stands.""

Attorney Robert Clifford said the legal action targets airlines and federal agencies following the midair collision at Reagan airport. (POOL)

NTSB LAUNCHES 3-DAY INVESTIGATIVE HEARING ON DEADLY DC PLANE CRASH

He said the group has also ""turned our grief into action.""

""We've collaborated with Congress on critical air safety reforms. We've secured a much-needed set of oversight investigations into the FAA, and we will not rest until similar investigations are underway into the US Army,"" Lane said. ""We'll bring that same level of passion and relentlessness as we seek accountability and change through the legal process.

""Many of us have been asked whether we dread the idea of rehashing the worst days of our lives in court. Our answer today is clear: We're ready. … We are here to see this process through, however long it takes, to ensure that our family members have a lasting legacy that makes the world safer for everyone who flies.""

The lawsuit is seeking both monetary damages and congressional air safety reforms.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Jimmy Kimmel Ran Right at His Critics","https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/09/jimmy-kimmel-return-monologue-free-speech-suspension/684348/","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 11:23:14 GMT","

The late-night host returned from his week-long suspension with a wry, emotional defense of free speech.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Jimmy Kimmel returned to late-night yesterday after nearly a week off the air with a monologue that largely dispensed with laughs. Instead, over the course of almost 20 minutes, he ran right at his critics, and stated plainly what many commentators have argued since production of Jimmy Kimmel Live was suspended this past Wednesday: “Our government cannot be allowed to control what we do and do not say on television.”

It was a forceful beginning to the episode, but also a fairly sober one—a speech that underlined the surreality of recent events, during which an irreverent talk-show comedian became a government target and a chilling, public example of the erosion of constitutional rights under President Donald Trump. Kimmel, who has spent most of his late-night career as a flippant but not particularly scandalous figure, acknowledged just how scary things had become that the White House might take aim at him. “This show is not important,” he said. “What's important is that we get to live in a country that allows us to have a show like this.”

Carr's threat—and the resulting removal of Jimmy Kimmel Live from broadcast—quickly raised alarm bells around Hollywood, where hundreds of Kimmel's peers signed an open letter by the American Civil Liberties Union, expressing support of the host. Officials in Washington, including those from both sides of the aisle, also expressed frustration with the commissioner.

“It is unbelievably dangerous for government to put itself in the position of saying, ‘We're going to decide what speech we like and what we don't, and we're going to threaten to take you off air if we don't like what you're saying,'” Senator Ted Cruz remarked on his podcast. Senator Rand Paul also called the commissioner's comments “absolutely inappropriate.”

Read: An escalation in every way

During his monologue, Kimmel acknowledged his surprise and appreciation for people like Cruz, a frequent punch line on the show, coming to his defense. “Maybe most of all, I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” he said, before playing the clip from Cruz's podcast. Kimmel's punch line: “I don't think I've ever said this before, but Ted Cruz is right.”

Cruz and Paul were among the rare elected Republican voices among a chorus expressing similar concerns—that the pressure being put on ABC set a concerning precedent for free speech. Even Carr, who initially seemed to celebrate Jimmy Kimmel Live's indefinite hiatus, attempted to walk back the idea that the FCC had been responsible. “Jimmy Kimmel is in the situation that he is in because of his ratings, not because of anything that's happened at the federal-government level,” he claimed on Monday, while speaking at a forum in New York.

Kimmel was plainly scornful of Carr upon his return, calling the commissioner's behavior “a direct violation of the First Amendment” and poking at his approach: “If you want to hear a mob boss make a threat like that, you have to hide a microphone in a deli and park outside in a van with a tape recorder all night long. This genius said it on a podcast.” Later in the show, the host did a segment with Robert De Niro, who appeared in character as a new, even more threatening FCC commissioner making naked threats to Disney.

Kimmel's strident stance last night made clear that he had prevailed in his week-long power struggle with Disney; he was addressing the controversy on what seemed to be his own terms. While the comedian did acknowledge his comments about the man suspected of killing Kirk, he offered no direct apology. (He also avoided discussing the substance of his joke; some had interpreted it as implying that the murder was an act of right-wing violence, which available evidence contradicts.) But Kimmel choked up as he insisted, “I do want to make something clear, because it's important to me as a human. And that is, you understand it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man.”

He continued, “Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what was obviously a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make. But I understand that to some that either felt ill-timed or unclear. Or maybe both. For those who think I did point a finger, I get why you're upset.” In his monologue, however, Kimmel was uninterested in further litigating those comments, preferring to focus on the First Amendment threat he saw in the FCC's behavior.

In all, suspending Kimmel stood to do more harm than good for Disney. The late-night host's contract at ABC isn't up until May 2026; removing him from the airwaves permanently would not have saved the network much money. That's why Stephen Colbert remains at CBS through next May, even if his show has become unprofitable—his contract as the host of The Late Show has to be honored either way. Beyond that, the public reaction to Kimmel's pre-emption was strong enough that it seemed to be costing Disney just as dearly. Its stock price briefly declined in the days after the news, hundreds of celebrities campaigned on Kimmel's behalf, and even some Disney influencers were calling for organized boycotts of the company. Kimmel himself mocked the backlash on last night's show, producing a piece of paper and reading a statement on his bosses' behalf that instructed viewers on how to reactivate their Disney+ subscriptions.

After Kimmel's monologue, the episode proceeded as Jimmy Kimmel Live tends to do, with some more political jabs (largely aimed at Trump) and a glitzy celebrity interview with the actor Glen Powell. The host's tone was less triumphant than resolute: He seemed convinced of the glum realities of our political moment. He criticized Trump for calling for his show's cancellation, and for that of the NBC shows hosted by Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers, pointing out that hundreds of employees at each program would be affected along with the hosts. “Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods because he can't take a joke,” Kimmel said. “Let's stop letting these politicians tell us what they want and tell them what we want.”

Kimmel has frequently pondered retirement of late; “I think this is my final contract,” he mused to the Los Angeles Times in 2024. More recently, he equivocated, acknowledging the crew that relies on him for employment: “I've realized that there's no point in talking about it. It upsets the people I work with,” he said in an interview with Rolling Stone earlier this year. But it seems doubtful that Kimmel's reign as the longest-tenured late-night host still working will last much longer.

What was clear last night, though, was that Kimmel did not want to just vanish from ABC. His presence on TV is still inspiring panic and outrage, with the local TV affiliates Nexstar and Sinclair refusing to broadcast his show pending further discussions with ABC. But the bellicosity surrounding Kimmel's comments has also receded: Sinclair dropped its idea of airing a special about Kirk in Kimmel's time slot (a rerun of Celebrity Family Feud aired instead). Late-night on network television, as a medium, has an outdated business model, and some companies may not go to the trouble of offering it as the media landscape continues to shift. But when Kimmel steps away from the desk, it'll likely be his decision.

You probably don't who Wang Laisheng is.

He's a billionaire, but he doesn't have that top-level name-brand recognition like a Musk or Bezos. He's not snatching headlines every day.

Even if you're unfamiliar, chances are you've used one of his products. In fact, you're probably using one right now.

Wang is the cofounder and vice chairman of Luxshare Precision Industry, a China-based manufacturer that originally made cables and accessories for Apple products before getting the bump up to start assembling the company's golden goose: phones.

He's had a great week in the market, with his fortune jumping significantly in the days since the launch of the iPhone 17 — a period that's seen Luxshare stock spike 32%. Shares are listed on China's Shenzhen Stock Exchange, and the company is reportedly eyeing a Hong Kong listing this year.

According to Forbes data, Wang's net worth is now $14.3 billion. That's up from $9 billion as of last Thursday's close, before the iPhone 17 launch. He added $788 million to his net worth on Wednesday alone as Luxshare stock rose another 7%.

Luxshare was asked by Apple last week to boost its daily production of the iPhone 17 by around 40%, according to a report from The Information on Sept. 19, the same day the new iPhone went on sale. This added to the positive momentum of the product launch.

Another bullish driver has materialized over the same timeframe, with The Information also reporting that Luxshare signed a deal with OpenAI to produce a consumer AI device.

Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steven Tseng sees this as a positive sign for the long-term health of Luxshare, saying it ""could be a fresh, long-term growth driver and diversify the company's revenue stream beyond Apple.""

Moral of the story: if you do a job well for Apple, then other tech titans will eventually come knocking. And if Luxshare continues growing as expected, so will Wang's wealth.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","The Shiller P/E ratio, a trusted stock-market gauge, just hit its highest level since the dot-com bubble","https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-shiller-pe-ratio-dot-com-bubble-ai-2025-9","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 14:43:00 GMT","

A trusted market gauge has surged to its highest levels since the dot-com bubble, signaling stocks are the most expensive in 25 years.

The Shiller P/E ratio, also known as the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, compares the current value of a stock index like the S&P 500 to its average, inflation-adjusted earnings over the last 10 years.

The S&P's Shiller P/E ratio crossed 40 on Monday for the first time since 2000, when it reached a record 44. That spike preceded a 49% crash for the benchmark stock index between March 2000 and October 2002 as the internet boom collapsed.

""The US equity market looks expensive relative to its history, pretty much any way you slice it,"" Russ Mould, AJ Bell's investment director, told Business Insider by email.

He added that the Shiller P/E and several other valuation measures are ""all in the top 10% of their historic ranges.""

Mould said that ""valuation does not guarantee an imminent accident,"" but investors might want to take precautions, in part because US stock returns have been ""modest to disappointing"" when they've traded at ""similar Shiller P/E multiples to those in evidence now.""

He added, ""The tricky bit is 10 years is a long time and you don't know when trouble is going to strike!""

The Shiller P/E ratio was developed by Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller, who predicted the dot-com bubble would burst in ""Irrational Exuberance,"" published just as the market peaked in March 2000.

He correctly warned the housing boom could collapse in the book's second edition, published in 2005.

Investors use the traditional P/E ratio to value a company's stock based on its earnings multiple, or how many times higher its price is than its earnings per share, or EPS, in a year. They calculate it by dividing a stock price by an annual EPS figure, either historical or projected.

Similarly, the Shiller P/E ratio takes a stock index's point value and divides it by the combined EPS of its constituent companies over the last 10 years, adjusted for inflation and divided by 10 to get a real, average figure.

So if the S&P 500 is at 6,700 points, and its average, inflation-adjusted EPS over the last 10 years is $167, dividing one by the other yields a multiple of 40.

The ratio can smooth out the effects of business cycles on profits by factoring in a decade's worth of earnings, providing a longer-term perspective on market valuation than the conventional P/E ratio.

The Shiller P/E ratio doesn't indicate an imminent crash, as markets can remain overvalued or undervalued for years.

It also doesn't account for interest rates, index composition, economic shifts, and corporate profitability, which can vary between time periods and influence valuations.

The S&P 500 has doubled in five years to trade at record highs, led by AI stocks such as Nvidia, which has soared almost 14-fold to become the world's most valuable public company with a $4.3 trillion market capitalization.

Several commentators have flagged that stocks are pricey. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a Tuesday speech that ""equity prices are fairly highly valued.""

Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, told Business Insider in August that the huge market values and vast shareholder bases of AI companies like Microsoft and Meta meant ""more investors will suffer than suffered in the dot-com crash, and their suffering will be more painful.""

But ""Shark Tank"" investor Kevin O'Leary and tech investor Ross Gerber dismissed the comparison between the AI boom and the dot-com bubble in separate interviews with Business Insider.

O'Leary said in August that the AI boom isn't like the dot-com bubble because ""you actually can see the productivity and measure it on a dollar-by-dollar basis.""

Gerber said that valuations are justified because AI companies promise tremendous growth and their profitability is ""just insane.""

Shanaz Hemmati, a veteran of two multibillion-dollar startups, says any prospective entrepreneur needs to remember one key lesson before launching a new business.

No matter how confident you are in your business idea, seek out as many prospective customers or clients as you can and get their feedback before you commit to a business model, she says.

Hemmati and Ross Buhrdorf are the co-founders of ZenBusiness, which makes artificial intelligence software aimed at helping first-time entrepreneurs navigate the regulatory processes of starting a small business. They launched the business in 2017, and it was most recently valued at $1.7 billion in November 2021, according to the company.

The pair previously worked together as executives at vacation rental marketplace HomeAway, which Expedia acquired for $3.9 billion in 2015.

When they teamed up to start ZenBusiness, they spent roughly 10 months researching their industry and talking to dozens of entrepreneurs about their businesses' biggest pain points around legal compliance, says Hemmati, 62.

""When you have an idea, you already have identified a pain point you want to solve for,"" she says. The next step is figuring out how to solve it, she says, but you shouldn't jump to that stage too quickly, or without first conducting necessary research.

Hemmati says she and Buhrdorf knew they wanted to build an AI-powered software that helped small businesses manage and file legal documents. They had already witnessed the issue firsthand working at a startup and also found public data that showed it to be a widespread obstacle for entrepreneurs across the country, Hemmati adds.

They initially planned on marketing the service only to existing businesses, but talking to prospective clients made them realize that they should instead target first-time business owners who've never navigated a ""pretty complex"" legal process before, she says.

""We spoke with roughly 50 to 100 prospective customers to understand what they needed most — everything from formation help to ongoing compliance and growth services,"" she says. ""We ran design sprints, tested different packages and pricing, even built websites and refunded early sign-ups just to see what caught people's attention and what they were willing to pay for.""

That strategy proved invaluable, giving Hemmati and Buhrdorf ""incredible insight and the confidence to launch,"" she adds.

Working with those business owners from the start also meant those clients would be more likely to keep using ZenBusiness' software as their companies grew, Hemmati says. ZenBusiness has now worked with at least 850,000 small businesses, according to the company.

The takeaway for other prospective entrepreneurs, she says: Any business idea needs to be properly vetted, and the first step is always researching your market and talking to the customers and clients you want the business to reach.

""[Start] by having that communication and collaboration, constantly interviewing your potential customers and learning about what is the next product that they're interested in, and how you should even go about building it,"" Hemmati says.

Steve Blank, an author and serial entrepreneur who teaches a course on the subject at Stanford University, similarly says that a failure to properly research your potential customers before building a business model is a ""fatal mistake"" that will likely doom any new business before it even launches.

""The most important [question] is: 'Well, who are my customers?' And the second one is: 'What do they want?'"" Blank told CNBC Make It in March. ""It's not: 'Here's what I'm building. Can I sell it to someone?'""

As important as it is to seek out that feedback, though, it can only help entrepreneurs who are actually open to new perspectives and willing to adapt.

""If you can't pivot or pivot quickly, chances are you will fail,"" Blank wrote in a 2010 blog post.

Hemmati agrees: ""There is a huge difference between those who have a mindset of exactly how they want to do [something], versus those who are truly open and think through [their options],"" she says, adding that, ultimately, that mindset can be the difference between success and failure.

Analyst ChartNerd reports that the native token may be preparing for a strong upward cycle similar to 2021. The chart indicates a comparable consolidation phase that previously preceded a rapid surge. Key Fibonacci extensions outline projected price targets between $1.20 and $3.30 during the 2025/26 cycle if the structure repeats.

The analysis identifies $0.16 (20-week EMA) and $0.11 (0.5 Fibonacci retracement) as critical support levels forming a launchpad for potential growth. The asset trades near $0.22, where maintaining strength above these support levels could signal renewed momentum toward higher Fibonacci extension targets of $1.20, $1.77, and $3.09.

HBAR has recorded a modest 0.82% increase in 24 hours, trading around $0.22. Price movement during this period fluctuated between $0.223 and $0.218 before recovering to current levels, indicating buyer activity around key support. A decisive break above $0.223 could provide a base for testing higher price levels.

The US government invests in vaccine development to, in part, protect soldiers from dangerous pathogens in various parts of the world.Credit: Jon Cherry/Getty

The abrupt termination last month of nearly half a billion dollars in US government contracts for mRNA-vaccine research rattled scientists working inside and outside industry. The cuts raised alarm about the country's commitment to the Nobel-prizewinning technology, which is credited with saving millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic and is regarded as essential for fighting viruses in the future.

How political attacks could crush the mRNA vaccine revolution

Yet not all large-scale research into mRNA vaccines in the United States is being dismantled. Nature has learnt that, even as the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) — led by vaccine critic Robert F. Kennedy Jr — pulls back, the country's military continues to bankroll parts of the same research.

Among the beneficiaries are programmes developing vaccines against some of the world's deadliest pathogens, including the virus that causes Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a tick-borne disease that kills up to 40% of those infected. In the United States, the government considers such research crucial not only because these pathogens threaten soldiers deployed abroad, but also because they could ignite a global outbreak.

“A lot of us are at least relieved the Department of Defense [DoD] is not abandoning mRNA research,” says Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease specialist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, Maryland.

Still, he cautions that the HHS's rejection of the technology, combined with broader policy fractures across the government, threatens to hobble national — and global — readiness for emerging infectious threats.

“The whole biodefence structure is completely derailed,” Adalja says. “I've never seen it be disconnected like this.”

Peter Berglund learnt that his company's federally backed vaccine programme was being cut the same way that many other affected firms did — in a 5 August notice from the HHS's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), which ordered an immediate shutdown of ongoing studies. For Berglund, chief scientific officer at HDT Bio in Seattle, Washington, the news was a gut punch, as he told colleagues at a conference on RNA-based therapeutics in Boston, Massachusetts, this month.

NIH has cut one mRNA-vaccine grant. Will more follow?

NIH has cut one mRNA-vaccine grant. Will more follow?

HDT had been developing a next-generation CCHF vaccine based on a form of RNA that can copy itself inside cells. The company had secured tens of millions of dollars in federal contracts, which it used first to test a shot in mice1 and monkeys2, and then to begin a human trial in Texas this July. The BARDA memo brought everything to a halt the very next month.

But “that was mommy”, Berglund says. “Then daddy calls.”

Within days, HDT executives heard from project managers at the DoD's Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO) for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense, which had been co-funding the CCHF vaccine research. HDT was told to restart its trial, with the JPEO pledging support through at least this first phase of clinical evaluation.

“It's been so turbulent,” Berglund says. The DoD funding, although substantial, is less than what had originally been pledged in conjunction with BARDA. “But, at least now, we can advance it through phase I” and worry about the rest later, he adds.

Others with projects co-funded by the JPEO also learnt of funding cuts and a “restructuring of collaborations” in the 5 August notice. But their situation is less clear.

Earlier this month, AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company headquartered in Cambridge, UK, began a human trial of two mRNA vaccines, despite the notice. Each is designed to protect against a different strain of avian influenza. Clinical-trial registries still list both BARDA and the JPEO as collaborators.

An AstraZeneca spokesperson declined to comment on the US government's role in funding the trial against bird flu — which has been infecting US poultry and dairy cattle and raising the spectre of a leap into humans. The JPEO did not respond to requests for comment.

In a statement, HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard disputed suggestions that withdrawing from joint projects would weaken the nation's pandemic preparedness, writing that “BARDA is prioritizing evidence-based, ethically grounded solutions”.

The JPEO and BARDA had also been jointly funding a preclinical-stage vaccine programme for biotechnology firm Moderna in Cambridge, Massachusetts3. The mRNA shot is aimed at Marburg virus — a close but even deadlier relative of Ebola — which caused an outbreak earlier this year in northwest Tanzania, resulting in ten deaths. Neither Moderna nor its collaborator, the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, responded to e-mails from Nature seeking comment on the project's funding status.

Barley is one of the oldest cultivated crops, with a complex evolutionary and domestication history1. Previous studies have rejected the idea of a single origin and instead support a model of mosaic genomic ancestry2,3. With increasingly comprehensive genome data, we now ask where the haplotypes — the building blocks of this mosaic — originate, and whether all domesticated barleys share the same wild progenitors or whether certain wild populations contribute more heavily to specific lineages. To address these questions, we apply a haplotype-based approach to investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of wild and domesticated barley. We analyse whole-genome sequences from 682 genebank accessions and 23 archaeological specimens, tracing the spatiotemporal origins of haplotypes and identifying wild contributors during domestication and later gene flow events. Ancient DNA supports our genome-wide findings from modern samples. Our results suggest that a founding domesticated population emerged in the Fertile Crescent during a prolonged period of pre-domestication cultivation. A key practical insight is that the high haplotype differentiation among barley populations — arising independently, or layered on top, of selection — poses challenges for mapping adaptive loci.

Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is an old crop. It is mentioned in some of the earliest records of human writing (3100 bce)4. By that time, plant cultivation was older than written language is now. Much of what we know about the early stages of the domestication and dispersal of barley and other crops comes from archaeological specimens, the earliest dated to 10,000 years before present (bp)1,5. These are mainly charred grains from which archaeobotanists can infer hallmarks of domestication such as loss of spike brittleness1. Molecular genetics has complemented these findings by identifying domestication genes and tracing the origins of their alleles in wild populations6. With the advent of affordable whole-genome sequencing, our ability to study crop evolution at high resolution has greatly improved7. New methods, such as the pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC), allow researchers to infer historical population dynamics from extant genome8. More recently, tools such as IntroBlocker have been developed to define ancestral haplotype groups (AHGs), enabling inference of local ancestry at the haplotype level rather than at the whole-genome scales9. These advances make it possible to ask not only where barley was domesticated but also how different genomic regions in domesticated barley trace back to their wild ancestors. Finally, ancient DNA sequences provide valuable insights into past genetic diversity, although their use is limited by the often poor preservation of plant material in many climates10.

For decades, researchers have sought to identify single centres of domestication using molecular markers, as in the case of einkorn wheat11. However, such a model has been increasingly challenged12. In barley, strong evidence refutes a monophyletic origin. For example, two independent mutations causing loss of spike brittleness — an essential domestication trait — are associated with geographically distinct wild progenitors6. Genome-wide data further support a mosaic ancestry model, in which domesticated barley derives from multiple wild populations2,13,14. Earlier studies often relied on reduced-representation sequencing or markers ascertained in domesticated lines, limiting their resolution. With the availability of high-quality reference genomes15 and broader sequencing of wild and ancient barleys16,17, we can now revisit barley domestication with greater precision.

Here we used whole-genome sequences from 682 genebank accessions and 23 ancient specimens to reconstruct the haplotype-level ancestry of domesticated barley. By assigning local genomic regions to their closest wild relatives, we asked which parts of the domesticated genome derive from which wild ancestors; whether certain wild populations contribute disproportionately to domesticated lineages; and how haplotypes were reshuffled through domestication and post-domestication gene flow. Our integrative, haplotype-based approach sheds new light on the origins and evolutionary assembly of one of the world's most important crops.

We started with the assumption that the present-day population structure of wild barley is related to what it was when human beings began to grow barley. Wild barley (H. vulgare subsp. spontaneum) is a genetically diverse taxon that occurs throughout western Asia. We analysed a total of 380 wild barley accessions, many of them from the Wild Barley Diversity Collection17, which had been sequenced to tenfold coverage with Illumina short reads (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Previous studies on wild barley agree on the fact that isolation by distance is the main driver of population differentiation in wild barley14,18. Using model-based ancestry estimation complemented by principal component analysis (PCA), we divided our panel into five populations whose geographical distributions roughly trace a path from the southern Levant, via the Syrian Desert, the northern Levant, northern Mesopotamia and Central Asia (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1a,b, Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 1). These populations had different levels of diversity (Extended Data Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 4). Low diversity in the Syrian Desert populations, which was accompanied by high differentiation from other populations, might be explained by higher genetic drift in the Syrian Desert (Extended Data Fig. 1d).

a, Collection sites and population structure of 143 wild barley genotypes with precise geographical locations. The coloured dots show the results of model-based ancestry estimation with ADMIXTURE (the number of ancestral populations (K) = 5, predominant ancestry component) and are plotted at approximate collection sites. Jitter was added to avoid overlaps between nearby accessions. Only unadmixed samples, that is, those whose major ancestry components was 0.85 or more are shown. CA, Central Asia; NL, northern Levant; NM, northern Mesopotamia; SD, Syrian desert; SL, southern Levant. b, Assignment to macrogeographical regions of 15 populations inferred from GBS data of 19,778 domesticated barley genotypes24. The population names encode the most common origin of samples and their predominant morphological and phenological characters (row type, lemma adherence and annual growth habit) as detailed in Supplementary Table 6. c, Archaeological sites at which ancient barley grains used for ancient DNA extractions were found. Ages of the samples, as determined by radiocarbon dating, are indicated in the figure. Geographical outlines in panels a–c were obtained from the R package ‘maps' (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=maps), which uses public domain base map data (under a GNU General public license: version 2).

If there were no recombination and gene flow, the number of sequence variants between two genomes would inform directly about divergence times. Three examples illustrate that this simple model is not applicable in barley: when we counted single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1-Mb windows and plotted the SNP distribution, we observed, between some pairs of samples, local differences in divergence times, most prominently between distal and proximal regions (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). In barley and its relatives wheat and rye, proximal non-recombining regions, so-called genetic centromeres, are extensive, have fewer genes and drastically reduced recombination19,20,21. In domesticated barley, sequence diversity in these regions is lower too14,19. The situation in wild barley is more nuanced. Looking only at between-population comparisons, the distributions of divergence times were unimodal in distal regions of all chromosomes with a peak at around 600 thousand years before present (ka bp; Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2c), which corresponds to a trough in effective population size at the same period (Fig. 2b). Fluctuations of population size were also evident from historic trajectories of effective population sizes computed with PSMC8. These data indicate that wild barley has recovered from a bottleneck between 2000 and 500 ka bp (Extended Data Fig. 3b). A later bottleneck in all wild barley populations (120 to 11 ka bp) coincided with the Last Glacial Period (Supplementary Fig. 2).

a, Distribution of sequence divergence (SNPs per Mb) between pairs of accessions from the SL and NL populations in distal, interstitial and proximal regions. The grey shading in the right panel marks the highest divergence between both populations owing to the presence of deeply diverged haplotypes on chromosome 5H (Chr. 5H). b, The distribution of pairwise sequence divergence for all sample pairs in distal regions of the genome (top), and the historic trajectories of effective population sizes in wild barley as inferred by PSMC (red) and global average surface temperatures (grey)39 (bottom). The area chart of population size was based on the sample pairs from the lowest identity-by-state (IBS) bin (0.6 < IBS < 0.67) in Extended Data Fig. 3b. The orange shading marks a simultaneous decline of population size and temperature that corresponds to peaks in the SNP distribution. The Last Glacial Period (120 to 11 ka bp) is marked by blue shading. Ne, effective population size. c, Violin plots showing the distributions of pairwise sequence divergence in proximal regions of five wild barley populations. The blue shading highlights the peaks in the distribution that mark the most recent divergence between pairs of populations; earlier such events are marked by dashed lines. d, Global average surface temperatures39 in the past 2 million years. e, The divergence of wild barley populations (most recent inferred split times) is represented as a tree.

Distributions of divergence time in proximal regions were multimodal and differed between chromosomes (Extended Data Fig. 2c). This observation defies easy explanation. It may stem from the paucity of centromeric haplotypes and their persistence as single linkage blocks on evolutionary timescales. To better understand this pattern, we asked whether the divergence of long centromeric haplotypes reflects the divergence between individuals and the split times between populations (Supplementary Fig. 3). To do so, we used SNPs in pericentromeric regions (centromere ±25 Mb) to calculate pairwise divergence times between wild barley individuals and arranged wild barley populations in a tree structure based on their most recent splits from each other (Fig. 2c,e and Extended Data Fig. 3a). This representation simplifies the relationships between barley populations. Of note, divergence times were multimodal, and the peaks in the distribution aligned with fluctuations in global surface temperature (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3a). This pattern may be attributable to repeated episodes of colonization of new habitats, contraction and potential loss of populations, recolonization and secondary contact between populations. For example, the common ancestor of the Syrian Desert, northern Mesopotamian and Central Asian populations split from the northern Levantine lineage around 120 ka bp when a warm climate may have created new habitats. The northern Mesopotamian and Central Asian populations split around 17 ka bp. This is consistent with the paleoclimatic modelling of Jakob et al.18, according to whom wild barley was absent from Central Asia as recently as 21 ka bp. The old age of the southern Levantine population (that is, its early divergence from populations elsewhere) is consistent with the supposed status of that region as a glacial refugium18. We were intrigued by the presence of a centromeric haplotype in some southern Levantine wild barleys that diverged from other such haplotypes around 900 ka bp (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Figs. 2c and 4). This is much a deeper split than seen within and between other wild barley populations. The ‘relict' haplotype may be a chance escape from genetic drift owing to larger population sizes in the southern Levant or may have been retained by selection for some adaptive advantage it confers. The latter hypothesis is lent some support by the fact that the relict haplotype predominates in many domesticated barley populations (Extended Data Fig. 4d) and that a selective sweep was detected with XP-CLR22 (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Fang et al.23 speculated that higher-than-average differentiation between wild barley on chromosome 5H (Extended Data Fig. 1d) may have been caused by a large pericentric inversion on that chromosome. We did see inversions in this region, but they did not extend across the entire haplotypes and occurred in other haplotypes (Extended Data Fig. 4e), making it unlikely that structural variation is the sole explanation for the long persistence of the relict haplotype.

To add domesticated barley to the picture, we selected from a large collection of 19,778 domesticated barley accessions24 a panel of 302 samples, of which we sequenced 116 to about tenfold coverage and 186 to about threefold whole-genome coverage (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Tables 1, 2 and 6–8 and Supplementary Figs. 5–8). We ran IntroBlocker on these data. As was observed in wheat, sequence divergence in domesticated barley, in contrast to its wild relative, was bimodal. This was true irrespective of whether distal or proximal regions were considered (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 5a). The recent peak at around 98 SNPs per Mb (approximately 8,000 years of divergence) corresponds to a bottleneck that marks the coalescence of many haplotypes into common ancestors in the hypothetical domesticated founder population (or populations). The earlier peak (6,500 SNPs per Mb, 530,000 years) mirrors that seen in wild barley and arises from comparisons between haplotypes that diverged before domestication. To group haplotypes according to whether they split before or after domestication, we set a threshold of 400 SNPs per 1-Mb window (corresponding to a divergence time of 32,000 years; Fig. 3a). We give exemplary figures drawn with a 5-Mb window size (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5b), but used 100-kb windows after inspecting haplotype length around a key domestication gene (Supplementary Table 9 and Supplementary Fig. 9).

a, Sequence divergence (SNPs per Mb) between pairs of wild (W) and domesticated (D) barley. The blue line marks the 400 SNPs per Mb threshold used by IntroBlocker to distinguish pre-domestication and post-domestication haplotypes. The green shading indicates the persistence of a founder population that began fragmenting into isolated groups from 8 ka bp (purple line). The recent peak started at approximately 300 SNPs corresponds to 25 ka bp, marking divergence between ancestral domesticated and present-day wild barley. b, AHGs on chromosome 1H inferred using 5-Mb windows. The 20 most frequent AHGs are shown in colour; grey indicates rarer AHGs.

The lines and shading denote the average and 95% confidence intervals, respectively, from 100 random subsamples. e, Proportions of haplotypes in domesticated barley that are shared with wild barley, grouped by their frequency in the domesticated barley and divided into 20 equal intervals (for example, 0–0.05, 0.05–0.1,…, 0.95–1.0). The data represent the genome-wide pattern across all seven barley chromosomes. f, Normalized two-dimensional haplotype frequency spectrum in wild and domesticated barley.

The percentages on the right margins indicate the relative sizes of frequency bins in domesticated barley (row sums), for example, 79.46% of shared haplotypes occurs at 5% frequency or less in wild barley. g, Haplotype-based Shannon diversity indices in wild (green line) and domesticated (red line) barley populations. Seven regions (blue shading) with an index of less than 1 in domesticated barley (dashed line) were defined as putative selective sweeps. The reference genome used was B1K-04-12.

A prominent feature in the whole-genome AHG maps of barley was the presence of long centromeric haplotypes that were shared between wild and domesticated barley. This haplotype sharing lends immediate visual support to the notion of the mosaic ancestry of domesticated barley (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5b). Owing to the lower diversity of haplotypes in proximal than in distal regions of the genome in both wild and domesticated barley, our diversity panel covers nearly all pericentromeric haplotypes, but does not achieve saturation in distal regions (Extended Data Fig. 6a). For example, there was only a single pericentromeric haplotype in domesticated barley on chromosome 1H, which was found mainly in Central Asian wild barleys (Fig. 3b). To paint a more general picture, 55.9% of domesticated haplotypes were present in at least one wild barley sample; in the converse scenario, 7.0% of wild haplotypes were shared with a domesticated barley (Fig. 3c). A saturation analysis makes it seem likely that a larger sample of wild genotypes might unearth more shared haplotypes (Fig. 3d). Conversely, some domesticated haplotypes may lack a wild counterpart: haplotypes private to the domesticate tend to be rare (Fig. 3e). They may have arisen after domestication by recombination of haplotypes inherited from the wild progenitors or their progenitors may have been extinct in the wild because of genetic drift. As expected after a bottleneck, the haplotype frequency spectrum differs between wild and domesticated barley. Common haplotypes (that is, those with a major allele frequency above 20%) are seldom seen in wild barley, but were more frequent in the domesticate (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Still, 79% of haplotypes in domesticated barley with an identifiable wild counterpart occur at low frequency (less than 5%) in the wild (Fig. 3f). Seven regions of the genome showed an extreme reduction of haplotype diversity in domesticated but not in wild barley (Fig. 3g). We inspected local haplotype structure (Supplementary Fig. 10) and annotated the functional effects of genomic variants residing in these intervals to prioritize genes for future inquiry (Supplementary Table 10), even though the large sizes of the regions preclude the confident identification of any single plausible candidate gene. More generally, the high genetic differentiation, evident at the level of both SNPs and haplotypes (Extended Data Fig. 8c,d), may make it impossible to map selection sweeps by outlier scans: in pairwise comparisons between domesticated populations, on average 7.5% of the genome did not share any haplotypes (Supplementary Table 11). Rather than from pervasive forces of adaptive evolution, we suspected that local lineage sorting may underlie this pattern.

We enquired into the temporal and spatial origin of haplotypes in domesticated barley by running IntroBlocker with different thresholds corresponding to divergence time brackets and inspecting which extant wild barley genomes have the closest relatives of domesticated barley (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 7). The resultant genome map of spatiotemporal relations is again testimony to the mosaic genomic constitution of the crop (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 7). The mosaic structure appears to have emerged early in the evolution of cultivated barley. About 91% of domesticated haplotypes with a wild counterpart split from the latter between 32 and 8 ka bp, that is, during the formation of the immediate wild progenitor of domesticated barley and the initial stages of domestication (Fig. 4b). Fewer than 9% are attributable to more recent gene flow. All five wild barley populations contributed to domesticated barley, albeit in different proportions. Wild barley populations from the southern and northern Levant and Central Asia each contributed between 20% and 27% of haplotypes and those from the Syrian Desert and northern Mesopotamia contributed 16.4% and 12.9%, respectively (Fig. 4b). There were also differences between domesticated barleys as to how much certain wild populations contributed genetic material to them. Haplotypes from Central Asian wild barleys were found more frequently in domesticated barleys from East and Central Asia than in other domesticated populations (Fig. 4d). This close affinity between wild and domesticated barley from ‘the East' had been noted by Morrell et al.25, who saw it as evidence for a second centre of barley domestication east of the Zagros mountains in Iran. Our explanation is that this trend occurred due to gene flow from local wild populations into already domesticated populations coming from the western Fertile Crescent. The northern Levantine wild barley population contributed more to domesticated forms in western Asia and Europe than to those in East and Central Asia, which had more Central Asian ancestry. Mediterranean barleys had a higher share of southern Levantine ancestry. This relationship may suggest different points of departure of early farmers from the Fertile Crescent. These results are qualitatively similar to those of Poets et al.2, but differ in that their analysis, based on 5,000 SNP markers, assigned a greater contribution (more than 50%) of southern Levantine wild barley to all domesticated populations.

a, Spatiotemporal origins of haplotypes of the EU-THS population of domesticated barley on chromosome 2H in 20-Mb windows. The height of the coloured bars is proportional to the probability that a haplotype entered the domesticated gene pool in a certain time period (left) or from a certain wild barley population (right). Yellow denotes haplotypes of unknown provenance owing to missing data, lack of a clear wild counterpart or potential gene flow from domesticated to wild barley. The results for all domesticated populations are shown in Extended Data Fig. 7. b, Spatiotemporal origins of domesticated barley haplotypes across the entire genome. c, Time periods at which haplotypes from each of the five populations entered the domesticated gene pool. d, Spatiotemporal origins of haplotypes in 15 domesticated barley populations. e, Time periods at which haplotypes from each of the five populations entered 15 domesticated barley populations. Haplotypes of unknown provenance were ignored when considering proportions in panels b–e. f, Spatiotemporal origins of haplotypes of the EU-SHW population on chromosome 7H. The dashed rectangle marks a haplotype that owes its presence in domesticated barley to recent gene flow. g, Sequence divergence (SNPs per Mb) on chromosome 7H between two EU-SHW accessions (HOR_17134 and HOR_17572) and two Central Asian wild barleys (WBDC_055 and WBDC_355). The dashed line marks 2 ka bp of divergence (random mutation rate of 6.13 SNPs per Gb per generation).

Domesticated barleys differ also in how much recent gene flow they have received from wild barley (Fig. 4c,e). Wild introgressions are most common in cultivated accessions from western and Central Asia, where wild barlEy is common: 12.8% of haplotypes in Syrian barleys (SYR-THM) are attributable to recent (later than 8 ka bp) wild introgressions (mainly from the Central Asian and northern Mesopotamian populations). We were surprised to see wild haplotypes flowing into northern European barley in apparently recent times: the cultivar ‘Kiruna' (HOR_17134) shared a haplotype on chromosome 7H, 100–200 Mb with a Central Asian wild barley (Fig. 4f,g and Supplementary Fig. 11). This observation can be explained by the use of wild barley as a genetic resource by breeders: Kiruna's pedigree features ‘Vogelsanger Gold', a variety from the 1960s with a wild barley introgression26. The same haplotype is seen in HOR_17572, which is purported to be an Austrian landrace. We considered errors in the passport records or accidental outcrossing during ex situ management as the most likely explanation for this case.

We inspected divergence levels between haplotypes post-domestication to infer split times between different populations of domesticated barley in a hierarchical manner (Fig. 5a,b, Extended Data Fig. 8a,b and Supplementary Table 12). We used only SNPs in haplotypes descended from the same wild lineage to compute pairwise divergence times between samples. First, we divided our domesticated barley panel into three groups: western (Near East + Europe), eastern and Ethiopian barleys, which all diverged from each other around 8.5 ka bp, reflecting the dispersal of agriculture from the Fertile Crescent around that time. Subsequently, western barley split into three lineages (Near East, two-rowed Europe and six-rowed Europe) around 7.5 ka bp. This is consistent with the archaeological records that show that by 7 ka bp barley had been introduced to Europe, North Africa and Central Asia27. These populations subdivided further between 7 and 5 ka bp. Divergence time distributions had multiple peaks in some comparisons. In the case of European barleys, gene flow between populations, which are differentiated by morphology and phenology rather than by geography, is plausible. In the case of western Asian populations from Georgia (GEO-THS) and Iran (IRN-THS), fine-scale population is conceivable: landraces in these mountainous regions may trace back to a common source population but have evolved in mutual reproductive isolation after reaching their current habitats. In Fig. 5c, we provide a graphical summary of these results in relation to known dispersal routes supported by archaeological evidence27.

The grey shading indicates barley archaeological sites dating back about 7,000 years; the red shading indicates barley archaeological sites dating back about 5,000 years27. We took archaeological sites27, divergence time and population structure (Supplementary Fig. 8) into account when drawing this figure. Geographical outlines were obtained from the R package ‘maps' (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=maps), which uses public domain base map data (under a GNU General public license: version 2). d, D statistics for different comparisons among ancient barleys and 15 domesticated barley populations. The outgroup was H. pubiflorum. Blue and red indicate significant results (|Z score| > 3), whereas grey indicates non-significant results (|Z score| < 3). A positive D value (blue) suggests gene flow between P1 and P3, whereas a negative D value (red) indicates gene flow between P2 and P3. The grey bars, with D values close to zero, imply no detectable gene flow. The solid circles represent D values. The error bars indicate ±1 standard error. Sample sizes of each population, standard deviations and Z values are provided in Supplementary Table 19.

How we think about barley crop evolution owes much to the genetic dissection of loci at which mutant alleles confer traits that are seen only in the domesticate, namely, non-shattering (‘non-brittle') spikes, fertile lateral grains (‘six-rowed' spikes) and the loss of lemma adherence to the mature grain (‘naked' or ‘hulless' barley). The corresponding genetic loci are BRITTLE RACHIS 1 and 2 (ref. 6), SIX ROWED SPIKE 1 (ref. 28) and NUDUM29 with mutant alleles btr1, btr2, vrs1.a1–vrs1.a4 and nud. These genes were not identified in genome-wide scans for regions with extraordinarily low haplotype diversity (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). The reason for this is that multiple independent loss of function of alleles are present at the BTR1/2 and VRS1 loci and that the widespread cultivation of naked barleys is confined to a few geographical regions such the Himalayas and Ethiopian highland. Even so, the persistence of long haplotypes (Extended Data Fig. 9a–c and Supplementary Fig. 12) around these genes and the accumulation in them of rare variants since the most recent, and indeed recent (less than 10 ka), common ancestor allowed us to date, in an approximate manner, the origin of domesticated loss-of-function alleles. We used Genealogical Estimation of Variant Age (GEVA)30 to estimate ages of mutant alleles and their surrounding haplotypes at the Btr1/2, Vrs1 and Nud loci. Our estimated age of 27 ka bp for the btr1 haplotype (Extended Data Fig. 9d) predates the earliest archaeobotanical remains of domesticated barley by some 17,000 years1,5, but it is closer to the approximately 22 ka bp estimate from an archaeobotanical modelling study31. It is not impossible that non-shattering barleys (and the causal haplotypes) languished as rare variants in the wild before early cultivators selected them for propagation. The btr2 haplotype originated around 15 ka bp, which is very close to the approximately 12 ka bp estimate from Allaby et al.31. The vrs1.a1 haplotype dates back to approximately 25 ka bp, consistent with the identification of it as the most ancient six-rowed allele28. By contrast, vrs1.a2 emerged around 8 ka bp, in line with the hypothesis that it was derived from cultivated two-rowed barley28. The age estimation for vrs1.a4 (approximately 7 ka bp) matches its current geographical distribution, being limited to Central and East Asian cultivated barley32. As a control, we also estimated the ages of functional (dominant) haplotypes of the Vrs1 and Nud genes. The estimated origins of the Vrs1.b2, Vrs1.b3 and Nud haplotypes far predate domestication — 26 ka bp, 55 ka bp and 35 ka bp, respectively. As a further control, randomly selected wild barley SNPs from the same genomic regions show estimated ages between 100 and 120 ka bp (Supplementary Fig. 13), consistent with the peak of effective population size inferred from the PSMC results (Fig. 2b). The ppd-H1 haplotype, which confers photoperiod insensitivity33, is estimated to be approximately 30 ka bp in age, which supports the view that it originated before domestication34. Even though the precision of molecular dating is limited by uncertainties surrounding mutation rate estimates, we can propose the following relative order of emergence of mutant alleles and their surrounding haplotypes: btr1, vrs1.a1, nud, btr2, vrs1.a3, vrs1.a2 and vrs1.a4 (Extended Data Fig. 9d). Their most closely related wild counterparts (Extended Data Fig. 9e,f) were found in different present-day wild barley populations: southern Levant (btr1, nud and vrs1.a3), northern Levant (btr2 and vrs1.a2) and northern Mesopotamia and Central Asia (vrs1.a1 and vrs1.a4). This result aligns with earlier gene-based analyses of the btr1/btr2 locus by Pourkheirandish et al.6, who posited two origins of tough-rachis barleys, one in the northern and the other in the southern Levant. The early origin of the nud mutation (16 ka bp) is consistent with the fact that hulless barleys from places as far apart as Tibet and Ethiopia all share the same 17-kb deletion spanning the NUD genes (Extended Data Fig. 9c). Yet, their overall genomic composition is quite different: the ETH-MNS and CA-SNS population do not share any haplotypes in 44.8% of the genome. We speculate that before the respective ancestors of Central Asian and Ethiopian barleys left the Fertile Crescent, they acquired the common nud allele as it was spreading from a single southern Levantine source across barley's early gene pool.

We analysed ancient DNA sequences of 23 barley grains (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 16) dated to between 6000 and 2000 calibrated years before present (cal bp) to see how they might complement our haplotype map of extant genomes. Fragment lengths, nucleotide misincorporation profiles and high mapping rates (Supplementary Table 16 and Supplementary Fig. 14) confirmed authenticity. All ancient barleys grouped together with cultivated types in a PCA (Extended Data Fig. 10a) and had the domesticated btr1Btr2 haplotype, common in western barleys (Supplementary Table 16). The barleys from Yoram Cave and Timna 34 were two-rowed forms with the Vrs1.b2 allele, likewise common in western types (Supplementary Table 16). Those from Abi'or Cave carried the six-rowed (vrs1.a1) allele. In most cases, the ancient barley samples carried the same long pericentric haplotypes as modern domesticated barley, with only a few exceptions on chromosome 7H, where some ancient barleys contained private haplotypes (Extended Data Fig. 10b and Supplementary Fig. 15). These analyses indicate that the ancient genomes derive not from direct descent of local wild stands but from a more widespread founder population that gave rise to cultivated barley across the Fertile Crescent.

We used identity-by-state clustering with our 19,778-sample genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) panel (Supplementary Table 17 and Supplementary Fig. 16) and genome-wide SNP-based phylogenetic trees (Extended Data Fig. 10c and Supplementary Fig. 17) to understand the relationship between our ancient samples and present-day barley populations. Both analyses supported the clustering of the two-rowed Yoram Cave and Timna 34 samples with the modern ISR-THS population, whereas the six-rowed Abi'or Cave sample clusters with the ME-SHS population. As the grains from Abi'or Cave were dated to 2000 cal bp, that is, to the Roman period, secondary contact between geographically distant barley population may have been mediated by sea-borne trade across the Mediterranean. Owing to the limited number of high-coverage ancient samples (only two per archaeological site), population-level assessments of genetic diversity were not feasible. We sought to detect changes in genetic diversity from ancient to modern Israel barley at the single-sample level by comparing the number of rare alleles (present in wild barley) found in individual ancient and modern genomes (Supplementary Table 18 and Supplementary Fig. 18). The results revealed a gradient in diversity, with Yoram Cave (6 ka bp) showing the lowest, followed by ISR-THS and Timna 34 (3 ka bp) with similar levels, and Abi'or Cave (2 ka bp) exhibiting the highest diversity (Extended Data Fig. 10d and Supplementary Fig. 19). Generally, ancient samples tended to show higher genetic diversity than modern samples. This is because, over the course of prolonged domestication, selective breeding and modern agricultural practices, the gene pools of crops and livestock have often experienced bottlenecks and strong selective pressures, leading to a reduction in genetic diversity. To explain why ancient barleys from Israel shows increasing genetic diversity in more recent times, we used D statistics to test for gene flow that might have caused this pattern (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Table 19). We performed D (ISR-THS, Yoram Cave; P3, H. pubiflorum), D (ISR-THS, Timna 34; P3, H. pubiflorum) and D (ME-SHS, Abi'or Cave; P3, H. pubiflorum). These tests found no detectable gene flow in the Yoram Cave samples, but reveal significant western introgression into Timna 34, and even stronger gene flow into samples from Abi'or Cave. These findings align with the genetic diversity patterns, further supporting the observed gradient. The gene flow detected between Israel and western barley populations approximately 3000 years ago could plausibly be attributed to interregional trade or population movements during the Late Bronze Age. Such exchanges may have involved the intentional or unintentional transport of barley grains or seeds, contributing to the observed genomic admixture between geographically distant regions. For modern two-rowed Israel domesticated barley (ISR-THS), sampling information indicates that they are admixed samples (Supplementary Table 7), and D statistics show that they still exhibit gene flow from the Mediterranean population (ME-SHS). Our study expands the understanding of the historical dynamics of modern Israel barley populations. Domestication-related selection may not have been the primary driver of diversity changes in Israel barley. Instead, long-distance trade, human migration and associated gene flow appear to have had a substantial role in enhancing the genetic diversity of modern cultivated barley in the region.

Our findings support and extend the two previously proposed models for the mosaic ancestry of domesticated barley, as outlined by Pankin et al.3: (1) recurrent introgressions from diverse wild populations into an early domesticated ‘proto-vulgare' lineage, and (2) a pre-existing population structure within the wild progenitor gene pool. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and our data suggest that both shaped the genomic composition of domesticated barley. The haplotypic origins of key domestication loci — Btr1/Btr2, Vrs1 and Nud — underscore this complexity. Their geographically disparate wild relatives point to a polycentric domestication phase, followed by a protracted period of cultivation localized within the Fertile Crescent (Extended Data Fig. 11). During this time, regionally structured barley populations — and the human communities that managed them — began to diverge genetically while maintaining some connectivity.

Our divergence-time analyses further support this scenario. The recent peak in haplotype divergence beginning at approximately 300 SNPs (Fig. 3a), corresponding to approximately 25 ka bp, marks the emergence of a distinct genetic lineage leading to domesticated barley. This estimate aligns with PSMC-inferred declines in effective population sizes between 25 and 10 ka bp (Supplementary Fig. 20), reinforcing the view of a protracted ‘proto-domestication' phase. This timing is also consistent with archaeobotanical evidence: the high frequency (approximately 36%) of domestic-type abscission scars in wild barley at the Ohalo II site (23 ka bp)35 suggests that cultivation predated the fixation of canonical domestication traits such as non-brittle spikes35,36.

Gene flow between early cultivated populations and nearby wild barleys contributed to the observed mosaic ancestry. In western Asia, this ongoing introgression continued well beyond domestication, as reflected in modern haplotype sharing patterns. Consequently, present-day western Asian barley varieties are unlikely to be direct descendants of the original domesticated founder population. As agriculture expanded beyond the Fertile Crescent, domesticated barley diversified into regionally distinct lineages. This geographical spread, accompanied by a decline in wild introgression, resulted in populations evolving largely in isolation. However, geography alone does not explain the observed structure. Agricultural practices and selection for distinct agronomic traits — such as the divergence between European two-rowed and six-rowed barleys — further shaped gene pools.

This evolutionary process has important implications for functional genomics. The deep haplotype differentiation across populations — arising from both ancestral structure and post-domestication gene flow — may confound signals of adaptation. In many genomic regions, different lineages carry no shared haplotypes, a pattern also observed in selective sweeps. This overlap between mosaic ancestry and selection signatures complicates the mapping of adaptive loci. One promising avenue for disentangling these effects is mutational genomics, where causative variants can be traced across structural and geographical contexts. The example of HvCENTRORADIALIS illustrates this approach: initially identified in classical barley mutant as a major flowering-time regulator, its broader role became apparent only through population sequencing, which revealed both structural variation37 and association with range expansion38.

In summary, our haplotype-based analysis provides a high-resolution view of barley domestication and post-domestication evolution. It supports a model in which early cultivation involved multiple wild sources, followed by gene flow, geographical divergence and local adaptation. This complex legacy continues to shape the genomic architecture of modern barley, and poses both challenges and opportunities for future genetic and breeding research.

Our wild barley panel (Supplementary Table 1) comprised 285 accessions from the Wild Barley Diversity Collection (WBDC)41,42, a collection of ecogeographically diverse accessions. The whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the WBDC collection has been described in a companion paper17. A further 95 diverse barley accessions, mainly from the panel of Russell et al.14, were also included. The latter set of samples had been sequenced to approximately 3× coverage by Jayakodi et al.37. In the present study, we resequenced 32 of these samples to increase their coverage to approximately 10×.

Milner et al.24 defined 12 populations using model-based ancestry estimation with ADMIXTURE43 in a global diversity panel of 19,778 domesticated barley, which had been subjected to GBS24. We used the ADMIXTURE results and GBS SNP matrix of Milner et al.24 for sample selection. Except for the Near-eastern population (coloured orange in figure 1b of Milner et al.24), we selected samples according to the following procedure. First, unadmixed samples, that is, those with an ADMIXTURE ancestry coefficient q ≥ 0.95 were used as input for a PCA with smartpca44 (v7.2.1). Then, samples were selected to cover the PCA space evenly (Supplementary Fig. 5). Owing to its higher genetic diversity and internal substructure, a more sophisticated procedure was followed for the Near-eastern population (Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Fig. 6). First, ADMIXTURE43 (v1.23) was run on 1,078 samples of Milner et al.24, where the Near-eastern ancestry coefficient q was higher than that of all other populations, with q ranging from 0.25 to 0.98. Before running ADMIXTURE, the SNP set was thinned with PLINK45 (v1.9) using the parameters ‘--indep-pairwise 50 10 0.1'. For each value of K (the number of ancestral populations) from 2 to 6, the output of 15 replicate runs of ADMIXTURE with different random seeds was combined with CLUMPP46 (v1.1.2) and plotted with Distruct47 (v1.1). Individuals with q ≥ 80% for their main ancestry component were considered unadmixed. The results for K = 6 was chosen for further analysis. The genetic separation of the defined populations was confirmed with smartpca44 (v7.2.1). Only those samples of the Near-eastern subpopulations that were actually located in the Near East were selected for sequencing. The selected samples were distributed in an equidistant manner in the PCA diversity space. In total, we selected 302 samples from 15 populations (Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Fig. 7). The populations were named according to their geographical origins and three key traits closely connected to global population structure24 (Supplementary Table 6): row type (two-rowed (T), six-rowed (S) and mixed (M)); lemma adherence (hulled (H) and naked (N)); and annual growth habit (winter sown (W), spring sown (S) and mixed (M)). For example, ISR-THS refers to a population whose members are predominantly two-rowed hulled spring barleys from Israel. For each population, we selected about 20 accessions for WGS sequencing. Among these, 7–10 samples of each population (total: 116, ‘high-coverage samples') were sequenced to approximately tenfold coverage. The remaining samples of each population were sequenced to approximately threefold coverage (total: 186, ‘low-coverage samples'). Seeds for all selected accessions can be ordered from the German Federal ex situ genebank at IPK Gatersleben.

Plant cultivation and DNA isolation were essentially as previously described24. Illumina Nextera DNA Flex WGS libraries were prepared and sequenced (paired end: 2 × 151 cycles) on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 device at IPK Gatersleben according to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina).

The reads of 682 barley genotypes, of which 380 were wild and 302 domesticated, were mapped to the MorexV3 genome sequence assembly15 using Minimap2 (v2.24)48. Mapping statistics of all 682 accessions are shown in Supplementary Table 1. BAM files were sorted and deduplicated with Novosort (v3.06.05; https://www.novocraft.com/products/novosort/). Variant calling was done with bcftools (v1.15.1)49 using the command ‘mpileup -a DP,AD -q 20 -Q 20 --ns 3332'. The resultant ‘raw' SNP matrix was filtered as follows: (1) only biallelic SNP sites were kept; and (2) genotype calls were deemed successful if their read depth ≥ 2 and read depth ≤ 50; otherwise genotypes were set to missing. SNP sites with fewer than 20% missing calls, and fewer than 20% heterozygous calls were used for ADMIXTURE runs (with K ranging from 2 to 4) as described above. At K = 4, wild individuals with 15% or more ancestry from domesticated barley were considered admixed. A total of 80 wild admixed samples were excluded from subsequent analyses (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 21). A total of 251 wild barley samples with high coverage (approximately 10×) without domesticated admixture were used for subsequent population genetic analyses (Supplementary Table 3).

We prepared two SNP matrices, SNP1 and SNP2, for downstream analysis. For SNP1, we extracted the data for 367 (251 wild and 116 domesticated) high-coverage samples from the raw SNP matrix. SNP1 was filtered as follows: (1) only biallelic SNP sites were kept; (2) homozygous calls were deemed successful if their read depth ≥2 and read depth ≤ 50 and set to missing otherwise; and (3) heterozygous calls were deemed successful if the allelic depth of both alleles was 5 or more and set to missing otherwise. The SNP2 matrix contained variants for 302 domesticated samples and was constructed from another bcftools run using the same parameters as above but with a downsampled dataset, in which the read alignments of the high-coverage samples (n = 116) had been thinned so as to achieve a sequence depth comparable with that of the low-coverage samples (Supplementary Fig. 22) using SAMtools (v1.16.1)49 with the command ‘samtools view -s 0.FRAC' (FRAC is the sampling rate). The targeted number of uniquely mapped (Q20), deduplicated mapped reads for the downsampled high-coverage data was set to a random number between 35 million and 52 million. Note that the read length was 2 × 150 bp in all samples. The matrix SNP2 was filtered as follows: (1) only biallelic SNP sites were kept; (2) homozygous calls were considered successful if their read depth ≥ 2 and read depth ≤ 20 and set to missing otherwise; and (3) all heterozygous calls were set to missing. A flow chart describing the construction of the SNP matrices used in this study is shown in Supplementary Fig. 23. In analyses in which the use of an outgroup was required, we used WGS data of Hordeum pubiflorum50. Read mapping and SNP calling were done as described above with one difference: a VCF file for all sites in the genome, including those identical to the reference genome, was obtained. This VCF file was merged with other VCF files to determine ancestral states. We also prepared a SNP matrix with 367 (251 wild and 116 domesticated) high-coverage samples using B1K-04-02 (FT11) as the genome reference16 for candidate gene search and SNP age calculation. The reads mapping, SNP calling and filtering procedures were the same as those used for generating the SNP1 matrix.

The number of SNPs between any two high-coverage genotypes were calculated as follows. First, pairwise SNP numbers were determined in genomic windows with PLINK2 (v2.00a3.3LM)51 with the command ‘plink2 --from-bp x --to-bp y --sample-diff counts-only counts-cols=ibs0,ibs1 ids=s1 s2 …', where x and y are the start and end coordinates of a window and ‘s1 s2 …' is a list of sample IDs. Different window sizes were used: 100 kb (shift of 20 kb), 500 kb (shift of 100 kb), 1 Mb (shift of 200 kb), 2 Mb (shift of 400 kb) and 5 Mb (shift of 5 Mb). Then, in each window, a normalized distance measure was calculated to account for the fact that owing to differences in the mappability of short reads, the effective coverage differs between genomic windows40 (Supplementary Fig. 24). Per-bp read depth was determined for each sample and each position of the reference genome with the command ‘samtools view -q 20 -F 3332 | samtools depth'. The effectively covered region of each window was defined as the union of sites with read depths between 2 and 50. For each, pairwise comparison between samples, the effectively covered regions were intersected using a Perl script. The pairwise distance in a genomic window was calculated as (hom + het/2)/cov, where hom and het are numbers of homozygous and heterozygous differences, respectively, and cov is the size of the intersection of the effectively covered regions of both samples. Genomic windows were considered only if the latter quantity amounted to half the size of the window; otherwise the distance was set to missing.

To evaluate the accuracy of our SNP number estimates, we used data from the second version of the barley pangenome16. Among the 76 accessions included in the barley pangenome, 13 overlapped with our sample set (Supplementary Table 20). We downloaded the HiFi reads of these 13 accessions and aligned them to the MorexV3 reference genome15 using pbmm2 (v1.10.0; https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbmm2). For HiFi reads, the effectively covered region was defined in the same manner as above but with read depths between 10 and 50 considering average HiFi sequencing coverage of approximately 25×. Variant calling was performed with DeepVariant (v1.6.0)52 to generate GVCF files for each sample, followed by joint genotyping using GLnexus (v1.3.1)53,54 to obtain a SNP matrix across the 13 samples. We applied the following filtering criteria: (1) only biallelic SNPs were retained; (2) only genotype calls with depth between 10× and 50× were kept; otherwise, the genotype was set as missing; and (3) for heterozygous calls, we required a minimum allele depth of 10 for each allele. We compared the effective covered region (uniquely mapped regions) of short-read and HiFi-read data across these 13 samples, as well as the intersection of effective covered regions between each pair of samples (Supplementary Fig. 25). The missing rate was calculated for each sample as the number of missing genotype calls divided by its effectively covered region. We then calculated pairwise SNP number between samples using the same method as described above, with a window size of 1 Mb (shift of 200 kb). Only 1-Mb windows in which the intersection of effective covered regions between the two samples exceeds 0.5 Mb were retained for SNP number calculation. Given that SNP number distributions along chromosomes are not always normally distributed — and may even be bimodal in certain cases — we applied Kendall rank correlation to evaluate the consistency between SNP numbers calculated from short reads and HiFi reads (Supplementary Figs. 26 and 27). Confidence intervals for Kendall's tau correlation coefficients were calculated using a percentile bootstrap method with 1,000 resamples.

The barley genome was split into three compartments (distal, interstitial and proximal) based on recombination rates19 (Supplementary Table 21 and Supplementary Fig. 28). Linkage disequilibrium decay was calculated for both wild and domesticated barley in each compartment using PopLDdecay (v3.42)55 with the command ‘-Het 0.99 -Miss 0.2 -MAF 0.01 -MaxDist 500'.

Variants calls of 251 high-coverage wild barley samples were extracted from the matrix SNP1 (see above). SNP sites with fewer than 20% missing calls, fewer than 20% heterozygous calls and minor allele frequency (MAF) ≥ 5% were used in population structure analysis. Model-based ancestry estimation was done with ADMIXTURE (v1.23)43. The number of ancestral populations K ranged from 2 to 5. At K = 5, individuals with more than 85% of its main ancestry were considered as unadmixed wild barleys. PCA was done with smartpca (v7.2.1)44. Genotype calls of the outgroup sample H. pubiflorum were merged with the SNP matrix, and an IBS-based genetic distance matrix was calculated with PLINK (v1.9)45. The distance matrix was used to construct a neighbour-joining tree with Fneighbor (https://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/cvs/embassy/phylipnew/fneighbor.html), which is part of the EMBOSS package56. The resultant tree was visualized with Interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL; v7)57. In each of the five wild barley subpopulations, the nucleotide diversity58 (π) and Watterson's estimator59 (θW) were calculated from the SNP matrix without MAF filtering using a published Perl script40. Pairwise fixation indices (FST) between pairs of wild barley populations were calculated in genomic windows (size of 1 Mb, shift of 200 kb) using Hudson's estimator with the formula given as equation 10 (ref. 60) using a published Perl script40. Coverage-normalized SNP distances were calculated as described above in 1-Mb genomic windows (shift of 200 kb). Distributions of log10-transformed distances in the genomic compartments distal, interstitial and proximal were plotted for each wild barley population in R (v3.5.1)61. To infer divergence times, only SNPs in a 50-Mb region flanking the centromeres (±25 Mb) were used. SNP distances were converted into divergence times using the formula g = d/2μ, where g is the number of generations, μ is the mutation rate and d is the number of SNPs per bp. We assumed that the generation time in the annual species H. vulgare is 1 year. We used a random mutation rate of 6.13 × 10−9 as had been determined by Wang et al.62 in the Pooideae grass Brachypodium distachyon. The SNP number distribution was visualized by frequency polygons with logarithmic binning (number of bins of 50, range of 101–104.5 (31,622 SNPs)).

Demographic inference was done with PSMC8 (v0.6.5-r67, default parameters) using pseudo-diploid genomes, which were created by combining the BAM files of two homozygous individuals as previously described63,64,65. We performed two types of PSMC analyses. The first was conducted separately for five wild barley subpopulations to infer their respective demographic histories (Supplementary Fig. 2). The second treated all wild barley samples as a single population to capture the average demographic history of the species (Extended Data Fig. 3b). For the population-specific PSMC analysis, we first calculated the IBS distribution for all pairwise combinations of individuals within each group. On the basis of the distribution, IBS values were divided into two to four bins. Within each bin, we selected either all sample pairs (if the number of combinations was fewer than 50) or 50 pairs (if the number of combinations was more than 50) evenly distributed from low to high IBS values (Supplementary Table 22). In selecting sample pairs, we also considered the sequencing coverage of each individual. A pair was retained only if the ratio of coverage, defined as ratio = coveragesample2/(coveragesample1 + coveragesample2), fell within the range 0.45–0.55. For the species-level PSMC analysis, the method was the same, except that each pair of samples was required to come from different subpopulations (Supplementary Table 23). PSMC is based on a panmictic model, assuming random mating, in which an individual (for example, a mammal) carries haplotypes derived from different ancestors. For selfing species, the outcome of pseudo-diploid PSMC is highly dependent on IBS. The higher the IBS, the closer the relationship between the pair, and the more likely the haplotypes come from a shared ancestor, which violates the assumption of random mating in PSMC. Conversely, pairs with lower IBS values are more likely to carry haplotypes from different ancestors, making them more consistent with the PSMC model. Therefore, we used the sample pairs from the lowest IBS bin (0.60 < IBS < 0.67) to represent the average demographic history of wild barley (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3b).

We used MUMmer (v4.0.0)66 to align eight barley genome assemblies with different haplotypes16 on chromosome 5H, 100–300 Mb. The minimum alignment identity was 90 and the minimum alignment length was 2,000 bp.

We used cross-population composite likelihood ratio (XP-CLR)22, a method for detecting selective sweeps based on allele frequency differentiation, to assess whether a selective sweep signal exists in the deep divergence region on chromosome 5H. First, we performed genotype imputation and phasing of the SNP matrix using Beagle (v5.5)67. We then applied a Python implementation of XP-CLR (https://github.com/hardingnj/xpclr) to calculate XP-CLR scores between the southern Levant population and each of the other four wild barley groups. The analysis was performed using sliding windows of 1 Mb in size (shift of 200 kb). According to our previous definition (Extended Data Fig. 4b), excluding the three intermediate haplotypes, the remaining wild and domesticated barley samples were classified into two haplotype types: haplotype1 and haplotype2. Candidate genes were identified based on the SNP matrix constructed using the wild barley accession B1K-04-02 (FT11) as the reference genome16 (Supplementary Fig. 4b). The effects of SNPs and indels residing in the genes of those regions were classified with SnpEff (v4.3t)68, and variants with high allele frequency differentiation in haplotype1 and haplotype2 were prioritized (Supplementary Table 5).

AHGs were defined with IntroBlocker (v2)9. To determine an appropriate threshold for separating haplotypes, we computed coverage-normalized SNP-based distances in 1-Mb windows (shift of 200 kb): (1) among wild samples; (2) among domesticated samples; and (3) between wild and domesticated samples. In each of the three cases, all possible pairwise combinations of samples were considered. We selected a threshold of 400 SNPs per Mb to separate AHGs. Coverage normalized SNP–distance matrices computed from 367 high-coverage samples were used as input for IntroBlocker with the ‘semi-supervised' model, giving precedence to wild over domesticated samples in the labelling of AHGs. IntroBlocker was run with different window sizes: 100 kb (shift of 20 kb), 500 kb (shift of 100 kb), 1 Mb (shift of 200 kb), 2 Mb (shift of 400 kb) and 5 Mb (shift of 5 Mb). The results of the 5-Mb run are shown in Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5b. After inspection of results (Supplementary Fig. 9), the results from the 100-kb (shift of 20 kb) run were used for downstream analyses.

The proportions of shared and private AHGs in wild and domesticated barleys were determined with custom Perl scripts. Saturation curves were calculated as follows. We chose sets of k wild barleys (from a universe of 251 samples) at random, with k ranging from 1 to 250. For each k, the selection was repeated 100 times. For each of the samples, we determined the proportion of haplotypes seen in the domesticate that were shared with that set. Mean values and 95% confidence intervals for each k were calculated in R (v3.5.1)61based on the t-distribution (via the t.test() function). Two-dimensional haplotype frequency spectra were calculated with custom Perl scripts. Genomic windows with more than 20% missing data points were excluded.

To infer the times at which wild haplotypes entered the domesticated gene pool, we ran IntroBlocker with different thresholds for haplotype separation: 400 SNPs (equivalent to an approximate divergent time of 32,000 years ago), 98 SNPs (8,000 years), 73 (6,000 years), 49 SNPs (4,000 years) and 24 SNPs (2,000 years). For each domesticated haplotype, we compared the results from IntroBlocker runs with different thresholds (divergence time brackets). The latest bracket in which haplotype sharing between wild and domesticated samples occurred was considered a terminus post quem for when a wild haplotype type entered the domesticated gene pool. This method is agnostic about the direction of gene flow. To exclude recent introgressions from domesticated to wild barley, we removed windows in which multiple domesticated barley samples and a few wild barleys share haplotypes that diverged within the past 8,000 years. To determine the spatial origin of haplotypes, we averaged the ancestry ADMIXTURE coefficients of all wild individuals in which a given domesticated haplotype occurred (Supplementary Fig. 29). If two wild samples that shared a domesticated haplotype were highly similar (pairwise IBS ≥ 0.95), only one was used for the calculation.

Saturation curves for the average number of haplotypes in a genomic window as a function of sample size were obtained by randomly selecting k individuals with k ranging from 1 to 115 for domesticated samples and from 1 to 250 for wild samples. For each k, the selection was repeated 100 times. Average haplotype numbers were determined for each subsample. Mean values and 95% confidence intervals were calculated in R (v3.5.1)61 based on the t-distribution (via the t.test() function). θW59 and the Shannon diversity index69 were calculated with a custom Perl script on haplotype matrices including only genomic windows with less than 20% missing data. The θW and Shannon index in seven barley chromosomes were plotted with Gnuplot using ‘smooth bezier'.

We looked for regions of reduced diversity in domesticated relative to wild barley and therein searched for genes that might have been potential targets of selection. To not bias the analysis by the use of a domesticated reference genome (that of cultivar Morex), IntroBlocker was re-run using the SNP matrix based on the wild barley accession B1K-04-02 (FT11)16. Regions with a Shannon index ≤ 1 were considered selective sweeps. The effects of SNPs and indels residing in the genes of those regions were classified with SnpEff (v4.3t)68, and variants with high allele frequency differentiation were prioritized.

The differentiation between populations of domesticated barley was assessed by computing the absolute allele frequency difference70. The following comparisons were done: NE + EU versus ETH, NE + EU versus Asia, ETH versus Asia, NE versus EUT, NE versus EUS, and EUT versus EUS. In addition, we calculated FST in genomic windows (size of 100 kb, shift of 20 kb) using the same method as in wild barley. Allele frequency difference was used for haplotypes derived from high-coverage samples (SNP1); FST calculations were performed for all samples, including low-coverage samples (SNP2).

Trajectories of effective population size across time were inferred with PSMC8 (v0.6.5-r67, default parameters) using pseudo-diploid genome sequence from two homozygous barley individuals. A generation time of 1 year and a mutation rate of 6.13 × 10−9 were used. We ran PSMC on 341 pseudo-haploid genomes obtained from all possible permutation of sample pairs from within 15 domesticated populations to reflect the population history of each subpopulation of domesticated barley. Given that domesticated barley originates from a mosaic genome composed of diverse wild barley lineages, we used the average demographic history of wild barleys (sample pairs from the lowest IBS bin between 0.60 and 0.67 in Extended Data Fig. 3b) as a reference background to compare temporal changes in effective population size (Ne) between 15 cultivated barley groups and wild barley.

Split times between pairs of domesticated barley populations were determined by inspecting the distributions of SNP numbers between pairs of samples in those windows (size of 1 Mb, shift of 200 kb) where a given pair of samples differed by fewer than 300 SNPs (corresponding to a divergence of 24,470 years). Only 1-Mb windows in which the intersection of effective covered regions between the two samples exceeds 0.9 Mb were retained for SNP number calculation.

The SNP number distribution was visualized by frequency polygons (linear binning; number of bins of 50; range of 0–300). SNP numbers were converted to divergence time using the following formula: time = (SNP number per Mb/106)/(2 × 6.13 × 10−9), where the 6.13 × 10−9 was the random mutation rate (μ) of B. distachyon62.

We used a previously published two-rowed ancient barley sample, JK301471 (approximately 6,000 years old, from Israel), to assess the accuracy of our method (Supplementary Fig. 30). JK3014 was chosen because it is a high-depth sequenced sample (102×) and underwent uracil–DNA–glycosylase (UDG)72 treatment, which reduces post-mortem DNA damage. JK3014 was jointly analysed with 116 high-depth modern barley samples for SNP calling. SNPs were filtered using the same preprocessing criteria that we applied in our SNP number calculation. We then calculated the SNP number between JK3014 and each of the 116 samples, without excluding C→T and G→A substitutions. The analysis used a 1-Mb sliding window (shift of 200 kb). To convert the SNP number to time, we used two models:

Model 1 assumes JK3014 is a direct ancestor of modern two-row Israel barley (ISR-THS). In this case, time = d/μ, where d equals the SNP number in 1-Mb windows/106 and μ is the mutation rate.

Model 2 assumes JK3014 and ISR-THS share a common ancestor, and their divergence time slightly predates 6,000 years ago. In this case, time = d/(coefficient × μ). If JK3014 was a modern barley sample, the coefficient would be 2. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for this coefficient lies between 1 and 2. We used 1.2 to approximate a divergence time slightly earlier than 6,000 years ago. In addition, as UDG treatment cannot entirely eliminate ancient DNA damage, we assumed 10% of the C→T and G→A SNPs might be false positives. Thus, the final equation for model 2 becomes: time = (d/1.1)/(1.2 × μ).

We used GEVA (v1)30 to estimate the age of haplotypes associated with three domestication genes in barley. For GEVA, the alternative allele is assumed to be the derived allele. As the domesticated haplotypes of these genes in domesticated barley are all recessive mutations compared with wild barley, we used the SNP matrix based on the wild barley reference genome B1K-04-12 (FT11)16. This setup ensures that the causal variant of the domesticated haplotype is treated as the derived allele. Phasing of the SNP matrix was performed using Beagle (v5.5)67. For genes with known causal variants, we applied the following strategies to estimate haplotype age: if the causal variant is a SNP (for example, vrs1.a3 and ppd-H1), we directly used GEVA to estimate the age of that SNP. If the causal variant is a short indel (for example, btr1, btr2, vrs1.a1 and vrs1.a2), we constructed pseudo-SNPs at the indel position (for example, for the 1-bp deletion at position 41,130,358 in btr1, C/−), such as C→A, C→T and C→G, and estimated their ages using GEVA.

In both SNP and indel cases, we also identified haplotype-specific private SNPs that are in complete linkage with the causal variant and used these SNPs to estimate haplotype age. The defining feature of a causal variant is that it is private to the focal population and has a genotype frequency of 100%. ‘Private' refers to those found exclusively in the focal haplotype relative to all other barley samples, including both wild and domesticated barley. The SNPs that we selected as being in ‘complete linkage with the causal variant' share these same characteristics: they are private to the population and occur at a genotype frequency of 100%. Therefore, these SNPs probably originated either before or concurrently with the causal variant and can be used alongside it to estimate the age of the haplotype. The actual age of the haplotype is thus equal to or later than the age estimated by this method. For each haplotype, we randomly selected approximately 40 private SNPs, as well as the causal SNP or pseudo-causal SNPs for the calculation (Supplementary Table 14). For large deletions (for example, Nud), haplotypes with unknown causal variants (for example, vrs1.a4) and functional (dominant) haplotypes in cultivated barley (Vrs1.b2, Vrs1.b3 and Nud), we estimated haplotype age using approximately 40 private SNPs specific to the domesticated haplotypes. To avoid confounding effects from recombination, we excluded all domesticated samples showing evidence of recombinant haplotypes in the regions of interest (Supplementary Table 13). GEVA analyses were performed using default parameters, and downstream filtering was conducted using the ‘estimate.R' script provided in the GEVA package. The mutation rate that we used is 6.13 × 10−9 from B. distachyon62. For each SNP, ten replicate runs were performed with different random seeds. Because recombinant haplotypes were excluded from the domesticated haplotype analyses, we reported haplotype ages based on the mutation clock model. Finally, given that barley is a highly selfing species with negligible heterozygosity (that is, nearly haploid in effect), and GEVA was originally developed under a diploid model (for human data), we multiplied all age estimates by 2 to account for ploidy differences and to report the final haplotype age.

As a control group, for each gene locus, we randomly selected approximately 40 SNPs (0.2 < allele frequency < 0.5) from wild barley within the same genomic region and estimated their ages (Supplementary Table 15). Given their uncertain origin — either recent or ancient in the absence of selection — low-frequency SNPs are less suitable as reliable controls. By contrast, high-frequency SNPs (for example, those with frequencies above 20%) are likely to have arisen in the past and become fixed or nearly fixed in the population, and thus are expected to exhibit older ages. For wild barley SNP, the joint mutation and recombination clock model were used. In addition, the recessive ppd-H1 allele, which may predate domestication34, was also included as a control group.

To infer the most likely spatial origins of three genes, a neighbour-joining tree for each gene was constructed with SNPs from an interval within their sweep region. For the btr1/2, vrs1 and nud loci, the interval extended from 39.4 to 39.7 Mb on chromosome 3H, from 570.5 to 517.2 Mb on chromosome 2H and 525.3–525.7 Mb on chromosome 7H, respectively. The neighbour-joining tree was constructed using SNPs based on the MorexV3 reference (SNP1).

We analysed ancient DNA sequences of 23 barley grains excavated at three archaeological sites in Israel (Supplementary Table 16). This number included published data of five barley grains from Yoram Cave71. Archaeobotanical procedures were performed as described by Lev-Marom et al. (manuscript in preparation). The sites Yoram Cave and Timna 34 have been described by Mascher et al.71 and Lev-Marom et al. Abi'or Cave is a medium-sized cave located on the eastern slopes of the Judean Desert, above Jericho, approximately 50 m below sea level, across from the Karantal Monastery. The excavations at the cave were directed by the late H. Eshel in 1986. It is situated above a larger cave known as ‘The Spies Cave' and has three openings above it. The cave contains a main long tunnel, approximately 50 m long, and has revealed archaeological material dating from the Chalcolithic period to the time of the Bar Kochba Revolt (2nd century ce). The cave was found to be heavily disturbed by animals, antiquities robbers and monks who lived in it during the Islamic and more recent periods.

All laboratory procedures for sampling, DNA extraction, library preparation and library indexing were conducted in facilities dedicated to ancient DNA work at the University of Tübingen. Before DNA extraction, all seeds were cut into two parts: one part of each seed (36-6.5 mg) was used for DNA extraction and further processing, the other part (26-3.4 mg) was used for radiocarbon dating at the Klaus-Tschira-Archäometrie-Zentrum, Curt-Engelhorn-Zentrum Archäometrie gGmbH. DNA extraction was then performed according to a well-established extraction protocol for ancient plant material71 and double-stranded dual-indexed DNA libraries were produced73,74. Six ancient DNA samples (TU697 and JK2281-JK3014) were treated with UDG72 before sequencing. Sequencing was done on Illumina devices at IPK Gatersleben, the University of Tübingen and the Max-Planck Institute or the Science of Human History Jena.

Paired-end Illumina reads of each sample were merged with leeHom (v1.2.17)75 and mapped to the MorexV3 genome sequence assembly15 using Minimap2 (v2.24)48. BAM files were sorted and duplicates were marked with Novosort (v3.06.05; https://www.novocraft.com/products/novosort/). Nucleotide misincorporation profiles were generated with mapDamage (v2.0.8)76. Variant calling was done with bcftools (v1.15.1)49 using the command ‘mpileup -a DP,AD -q 20 -Q 20 --ns 3332'. We omitted the parameter ‘--variants-only' in ‘bcftools call' to output genotype in all sites. C→T and G→A were excluded, where the C and G are the alleles in the reference genomes and T and A are the alternative alleles called from the short-read data. The resultant SNP matrix was merged with the three different SNP matrices: SNP1 (367 high-coverage samples), SNP2 (302 domesticated barleys) and a published SNP matrix constructed from GBS data of 19,778 domesticated barleys24. The GBS matrices had been filtered for site-level missing rate (less than 20%) before merging. The merged SNP1 matrix was used for PCA with smartPCA (v7.2.1)44 using the parameter ‘lsqproject: YES'. Neighbour-joining trees were constructed using only SNPs in a 50-Mb region flanking the centromeres (±25 Mb) on each of the seven chromosomes and including only six high-coverage ancient DNA samples, to determine the proximal haplotypes of ancient barley. The merged GBS matrix was used to compute an IBS matrix with PLINK (v1.9)45. To examine the phylogenetic relationships between ancient DNA and modern domesticated barley, we constructed genome-wide phylogenetic trees using two merged SNP datasets: SNP1 and SNP2, each incorporating ancient DNA samples.

To compare genetic diversity between individual ancient and modern barley samples without relying on population-level statistics, we leveraged rare alleles identified in a comprehensive wild barley panel as proxies for ancestral diversity (Supplementary Fig. 18). Wild barley has the most extensive reservoir of allelic variation; alleles with very low frequency in this panel (for example, 0 < MAF ≤ 0.01) are unlikely to persist through strong bottlenecks or selective sweeps, and thus serve as sensitive markers of lost diversity. For each sample pair, we counted the number of these wild-derived rare alleles present in the ancient genome (A) and in the modern genome (M), and defined the ‘relative diversity change' as (M – A)/A. A positive value indicates retention or gain of ancestral diversity in the modern sample, whereas a negative value signifies diversity loss relative to the ancient sample. This approach allows us to quantify diversity change at the single-sample level in a straightforwards, interpretable manner, without requiring large cohort sizes or population-based diversity estimators. We calculated the relative change in genetic diversity between six high-coverage ancient samples and modern domesticated barley individuals from 15 populations.

The merged SNP1 and SNP2 were also used for the calculation of D statistics with the qpDstat program of ADMIXTOOLS (v3.0)77. On the basis of previous phylogenetic analyses, we identified ISR-THS as the closest modern barley population to both Yoram Cave and Timna 34, and ME-SHS as the closest to Abi'or Cave. To test for potential gene flow between ancient and modern barley, we performed the following three D statistics analyses: D (ISR-THS, Yoram Cave; P3, H. pubiflorum), D (ISR-THS, Timna 34; P3, H. pubiflorum) and D (ME-SHS, Abi'or Cave; P3, H. pubiflorum). Here P3 refers to any of the 14 modern barley populations other than ISR-THS or ME-SHS, and H. pubiflorum is the outgroup.

(a–c) SNP haplotypes surrounding the Btr1/Btr2, Vrs1, and Nud loci, respectively. Only domesticated barley accessions lacking recombination events within the sweep regions were included. (d) Box plots showing the estimated ages of causal and private SNPs within each mutant haplotype, as inferred by GEVA. Each box plot is based on n = S × 10, where S represents the number of SNP sites used, and the data were generated by repeating the analysis 10 times with different random seeds. Specifically, for each allele, the number of data points used to generate the box plots is as follows: btr1 (n = 40 × 10), btr2 (n = 42 × 10), vrs1.a1 (n = 43 × 10), Vrs1.b2 (n = 39 × 10), vrs1.a2 (n = 3 × 10), Vrs1.b3 (n = 41 × 10), vrs1.a3 (n = 1 × 10), vrs1.a4 (n = 40 × 10), Nud (n = 39 × 10), and nud (n = 40 × 10). Box plots show the median (center line), the 25th and 75th percentiles (box bounds), and whiskers extend to values within 1.5× the interquartile range (IQR); outliers beyond this range are shown as individual points. (e) Neighbor-joining tree constructed from SNPs within the sweep intervals shown in panels (a–c), including both wild and domesticated barley accessions. (f) Geographic collection sites of wild barley samples whose haplotypes at the three loci are most closely related to those of domesticated barley. Geographical outlines were obtained from the R package ‘maps' (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=maps), which uses public domain base map data (under a GNU General public license: version 2).

(a) PCA on high-coverage wild and domesticated samples onto which 23 ancient barleys were projected. (b) Phylogenetic tree illustrating haplotypes around the pericentromeric region on chr1H. High-coverage sequencing data were used from wild barley (n = 251), domesticated barley (n = 116), and ancient barley (n = 6). SNPs located within ±25 Mb of the centromere were used for tree construction. (c) Unrooted neighbor-joining showing the relationships between 23 ancient and 116 high coverage modern domesticated barley accessions. (d) Relative diversity change between modern Israel two-rowed barley (ISR-THS) and ancient barley accessions from three Israel sites. Each box plot is based on n = 6 biologically independent sample pairs, each consisting of one modern and one ancient barley accession. A positive value indicates an increase in diversity in modern barley relative to ancient barley, while a negative value indicates a decrease. Box plots show the median (center line), the 25th and 75th percentiles (box bounds), and whiskers extend to values within 1.5× the interquartile range (IQR); outliers beyond this range are shown as individual points.

The five colors in the tree on top represent the five wild barley populations (SL, NL, SD, NM and CA as shown in Fig. 1a), and their split times are based on results from Fig. 2e. Arrows correspond to domestication-related genes. The starting point of each arrow marks the estimated time when the domestication mutation emerged (Extended Data Fig. 9d) and from which wild barley population it originated. Note that the tip of the arrow of each arrow is symbolic—it does not represent the exact timing of entry into the founder population. Gene flow—facilitated by human migration or cultural exchange—gave rise to an admixed founder population. As populations of human farmers and their crops expanded outward from the Fertile Crescent, this founder population split into several geographically isolated lineages, each retaining chromosomal segments with diverse wild ancestry. The divergence of domesticated barley from this founder population is referenced from Fig. 5b. The rectangles in the bottom-right part represent chromosomes of four domesticated barley clusters (Near East, Europe, Ethiopia and C & E Asia) divided into windows, with dashed lines separating distal and proximal regions. C & E Asia refers to Central and Eastern Asia domesticated barley population. The cyan-colored rectangles indicate recent (<8 ka BP) gene flow from wild to domesticated barley in regions of sympatry. The timeline at the top shows the chronological sequence of agricultural cultures in the Near East and was adapted from Zeder et al.81.

The drug interleukin-2 does a great job of goosing a patient's immune response to certain kidney and melanoma cancers. In fact, it can crank the immune system so high that it triggers life-threatening toxic conditions. 

But now researchers with the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design have used AI to engineer a protein that can quickly shut off interleukin-2, as just one example of the technology's potential applications. 

The scientists describe their work in a paper being published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature.  

“One way to control a medicine is through dose. We've added a second lever by designing molecules that can be switched off rapidly, even after they've taken full effect,” said David Baker, senior author of the study and a 2024 Nobel Laureate for his work in computational protein design.

The engineered protein works by inserting itself into a complex of proteins that are bound together, changing their shape and causing them to fall apart. In the example pursued by the UW scientists, the novel protein targets a complex that includes interleukin-2 that's tightly bound to an immune cell receptor, causing it to quickly release. 

With one of these engineered proteins, “you could much more precisely control the duration of [immune response] signaling and also immediately shut down any immune activation, even after it's already started,” said Adam Broerman, lead author of the Nature paper and a graduate student in Baker's lab. 

The interleukin-2 experiments were performed in human cells in the lab, demonstrating the strategy works. Going forward, the tool could be used to develop therapies for cancer and other diseases. It could also be used in studies that seek to understand and manipulate cellular processes by rapidly turning protein interactions off and on. 

In his research, Broerman tried a variety of engineered proteins, tweaking different components to optimize the impact. 

Earlier experiments showed modest improvements to the speed at which the proteins broke apart. When Broerman landed on the winning solution, the de novo protein worked so fast he had to recalibrate his measuring devices to clock the disassociation. 

“That was probably one of the most fun weeks of my life, when this first started working,” Broerman said.

The study was led by scientists at the Institute for Protein Design and included researchers from the UW's Department of Chemistry, Osnabrück University, Stanford University and Oregon Health & Science University.

Apply now, do YC after you graduate. For students who want to finish school before doing YC. Get funded the moment you're accepted.

Sneha and Anushka, founders of Spur (S24), applied in Fall 2023 for the S24 batch using Early Decision. This allowed them to graduate in May 2024 and then do YC. They've since raised $4.5M from top investors for their AI-powered QA testing tools.

Early Decision lets you apply to YC while you're still in school and reserve your spot in a future batch. For example, you apply in Fall of this year, for a spot in the summer batch of the following year. You submit the same YC application as if you were applying for the upcoming batch. If you're accepted, we'll fund you immediately and hold your place for after you graduate.

This program is designed for students who want to finish their degree before starting a company. If you're considering working on your own startup after graduation, Early Decision makes it easy to lock in your spot.

Even if you're not completely sure yet if you want to do a startup, you should still apply. There is no downside.

Also, if you're not in your final year, you can still apply for Early Decision. You'll be able to finish the school year you're currently in, and then either join a later batch or decide to drop out and start sooner.

The most common path is students applying in the fall of their final year and joining the summer batch after graduating in Spring. But you can apply for any batch in the future within reason. The application and interview process is the same as if you were applying for the upcoming batch. Once you're accepted, YC funds you right away and confirms your future batch.

When you fill out your YC application, you'll see a question asking which batch you want to apply for. Simply select ""A batch after Winter 2026"" to indicate you're applying for Early Decision, and tell us which batch you'd like to be considered for.

The batch preference question in the YC application

Many students want to finish their degree or complete more of their education before starting a company. Also we know that many students spend a lot of time in Fall or during their final year applying for jobs or internships. Early Decision gives students another option: apply to YC and bet on yourself.

Apply now and secure your spot in a future YC batch.

				A delegation of South American soccer officials met at FIFA headquarters in New York on Tuesday to make their pitch for an expanded 2030 World Cup.			


				The 2030 tournament marks the 100th anniversary of the World Cup and expanding the tournament to 64 teams would serve as a one-time celebration.			


				Critics say expansion will water down the competition during the tournament and the qualifying criteria needed to make the field.			

A formal push to expand the World Cup to 64 teams is now on the table, but it is a long way from becoming reality. A delegation of South American soccer officials met at FIFA headquarters in New York on Tuesday to make their pitch to soccer's governing body.

The 2030 tournament marks the 100th anniversary of the World Cup and will be held across the largest geographic area in tournament history. Six countries on three continents will host games.

Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina will host the first three matches in tribute to the competition's beginnings in South America in 1930. The rest of the tournament will then move to Morocco, Spain and Portugal. Expansion to 64 teams would likely lead to more matches being played in South America and allow for all 10 teams in CONMEBOL, South American soccer's governing body, to qualify for the event.

Alejandro Domínguez, the president of CONMEBOL, wants to celebrate the 100th anniversary with a one-time-only expansion. He posted a message on Instagram from the streets of New York City before the meeting with FIFA, according to The Athletic.

“It cannot pass by as just another event; it cannot be a normal World Cup. We see this as a once-in-a-100-year opportunity.” Domínguez said.

The World Cup has grown significantly in recent decades, increasing from 16 to 24 teams in 1982, then expanding to 32 teams in 1998. The 2026 tournament expanded to 48 teams and a record 104 total matches and will kick off in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada next summer.

The 2026 World Cup, held next summer in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, will feature a record 48 teams and 104 total matches. 

Critics say expansion will water down the competition during the tournament, in addition to the qualifying criteria and matches leading up to the event. There are also significant travel and logistical challenges when expanding from 104 matches to 128. UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin didn't pull any punches when asked for his opinion in April.  

“This proposal was maybe more surprising for me than for you,” Čeferin said. “I think it's a bad idea. I think it's not a good idea for the World Cup itself, and it's not a good idea for our qualifiers as well.”

The Guardian reported on Wednesday that despite the latest meeting, FIFA has no plans to expand, and it is duty-bound to consider any proposal raised. 

A source told the website, “Gianni would not get that vote through the Council even if he wanted to. The overwhelming feeling around the table – and not just in Europe – is that 64 teams would damage the World Cup. There'd be too many uncompetitive matches and it would risk damaging the business model.”

Any decision to expand in 2030 would need to be formally discussed by the FIFA Council, which meets in Zurich next month. The Guardian reports the expansion topic is not yet on the council agenda. 


A proposal to expand the 2030 FIFA World Cup to 64 teams raises questions about the tournament's format, competitive integrity, and logistical feasibility, potentially shaping the future of global soccer events.

South American officials are formally pushing for a one-time expansion to 64 teams in 2030, seeking to commemorate the event's centenary and allow broader participation.

Critics, including UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin, warn expansion could weaken the competition and complicate logistics, raising debate about the tournament's quality and business model.

Expanding the tournament would require addressing complex issues such as increased travel, scheduling more matches, and accommodating more teams, impacting planning for global sporting events.



		Synthesized coverage insights across 	42		 media outlets	


South American leaders and football officials have publicly expressed enthusiasm for the expansion, citing increased participation and historical significance. Critics, particularly from Europe and other confederations, have responded with skepticism due to concerns about quality and logistics.

Expanding to 64 teams could increase World Cup access for countries worldwide, fostering broader inclusion and exposure while raising logistical, environmental and competitive concerns that would affect football on a global scale.

Should the expansion pass, all CONMEBOL members would likely qualify, impacting qualification structures and regional football economies. Host nations would need significant investment in infrastructure and services to accommodate the increased number of teams and matches.

Abbi Pulling reviews the Baku Grand Prix on The Cooldown Room

Race Recap: Azerbaijan

Liam Lawson and Isack Hadjar reflect on scoring points for Racing Bulls in Baku, a result that saw them rise up to sixth in the Teams' Standings.

Liam Lawson was left with mixed feelings in the wake of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after failing to convert a P3 grid slot into a maiden podium for Racing Bulls, despite still scoring his career best F1 result with an impressive fifth.

With team mate Isack Hadjar also finishing in the top 10, it proved to be a strong weekend for Racing Bulls who were able to jump above Aston Martin into P6 in the Teams' Championship.

However, for Lawson, fifth was realistically the best he could have hoped for despite securing a superb third-place start on the grid in Saturday's chaotic Qualifying session in Baku. Starting ahead of both Mercedes cars for the Sunday's race, with both proving to be very quick in the cooler conditions, Lawson was forced on the defence from word go, with Kimi Antonelli in DRS range of his car for the first stint.

When the teenager boxed, Lawson then had to contend with George Russell hunting him down behind.

Pitting to get rid of his mediums, Lawson came out just ahead of Antonelli – but he soon lost out to the Mercedes man, whose tyres were already up to temperature.

He was also jumped by Russell who ran a very long first stint to enact the overcut on his way to an eventual second place, but did well in the closing stages without DRS to keep a gaggle of cars including the Red Bull of Yuki Tsunoda behind.

“I think rewarding after the last 10 or 15 laps, it was pretty intense,” Lawson explained. “Obviously, it is a little bit disappointing from where we are starting and realistically we didn't have the speed to fight with the guys in front today.

“But you're always hopeful. And we tried everything today, but there just wasn't quite enough, but still to have a P5 is big for us, especially in the Championship right now. Yeah, massive thanks to the team, we have had a good car all weekend and happy to come home with some points.”

Lawson's drive was particularly impressive considering how much pressure he was under throughout the race, with Antonelli the only driver able to overtake him on the track. The Kiwi star does not have a confirmed seat on the grid for next year either – so bagging his best F1 finish was a timely result.

“Honestly I think it is the best we had today,” he concluded.

As for Hadjar, his race almost ground to a halt before it had even begun when a hydraulics issue was detected on his way to the grid. The team did a great job to fix the problem so he could start the race, but the rookie ran into problems at a very early stage.

“I had a really good start, went by Lando [Norris] into Turn 2, and I made a mistake on the Safety Car restart and lost two places,"" he said. ""And from there the momentum was just not very good, the pace on the medium was not great.

“But then moving onto the hard, the pace was amazing and we were catching the group ahead quite fast but not enough to go and have a go.”

Hadjar eventually wound up 10th behind Charles Leclerc, which was all the more impressive considering he had struggled compared to his team mate across every session in Baku.

“I had a really bad feeling this weekend with the car, I wasn't comfortable and still somehow, we went to Q3, double score finish,"" he continued. ""So yeah, gives me a lot of positives that when I'm going to feel good inside that car, we are going to deliver way better.”

Laila Lockhart Kraner and director Ryan Crego tease the interactive big-screen adaptation of Netflix's hit preschool series, also starring Kristen Wiig and Gloria Estefan.


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


	The Gabby's Dollhouse movie isn't available — yet (as Gabby would say, with emphasis). But now just days away from releasing in movie theaters across the country, Gabby herself wants to tell fans of all ages what to expect when Netflix‘s popular preschool series goes big screen.


	“It's a lot of fun. The little kids are going to stay entertained,” star Laila Lockhart Kraner tells The Hollywood Reporter of DreamWorks Animation‘s first live-action/animated hybrid film, written and directed by Ryan Crego. “They're going to be able to sing and dance. But I also think there's going to be a lot for everybody. Even older members of the family, the parents, too.”

					Why Edward Berger Made 'Ballad of a Small Player' After ""an Abundance of Choice"" in the Wake of His 'Conclave' Success		
			









	Kraner, who is now 17, was 12 when she was first cast as Gabby, the live-action girl who uses magic in her cat ears to “pinch in” and shrink herself, along with her favorite stuffed animal, to go inside an animated version of her vibrant dollhouse. Gabby, best pal Pandy and her ensemble of cat-inspired friends — Cakey, MerCat, Carlita, Catrat, Baby Box, Kitty Fairy, Pillow Cat and DJ Catnip — have taken young viewers on 76 episodes and 11 seasons of cat-adventures with the hit Netflix series, all culminating now in Universal Pictures' Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie. (Season 12 will bring six new episodes in November.)


	The 98-minute movie follows Kraner's growing-up Gabby on a road trip with her Grandma Gigi (played by the iconic Gloria Estefan) to “Cat Francisco,” where her dollhouse inadvertently finds its way into the hands of an eccentric cat lady named Vera, who is played by the also iconic Kristen Wiig. Gabby and her Gabby Cats then set off on a real-world/animated adventure to save her dollhouse.

	











	“There's a lot of funny comedy for everybody, and there are a lot of good messages that I think apply to all ages about keeping the magic of play alive,” says Kraner of the movie's takeaways. “I think that's something important for little kids to hear, and also for adults to hear. So it's a lot of fun for the whole family.”


	Kraner says she was on set making an episode of Gabby's Dollhouse a couple of years ago when creators Traci Paige Johnson and Jennifer Twomey first floated the idea of making a Gabby movie to her. “But even then I wasn't sure how big it was going to be, if it was going to go into theaters or not. They just had a couple of concepts,” she recalls. Then, enter animation creator, writer and director Crego, who was approached at a time when Gabby's Dollhouse was playing on loop in his own home.


	“This was my daughter's favorite show. We have every toy. That'd be the coolest thing ever to make her favorite show into a movie. And, my son, who has grown up during the course of making this movie, has also fallen into the Gabby fandom,” Crego tells THR. “There was a period where I would be writing and working on [the movie], and then I'd come downstairs and hear [the show's theme song] Hey, Gabby!“


	Wiig was at the top of their list to play the cat lady villain whose improv brings the biggest laughs (and, according to Crego, also had the crew in stitches). Crego, inspired by his Cuban heritage, said a lightning bolt went off when casting Gabby's Gigi. “We were really lucky that she jumped on board because it's hard to imagine anyone else in that role,” he says of Estefan, who helps expand Gabby's world and also explains its magic. The voice cast also includes Thomas Lennon, Jason Mantzoukas, Ego Nwodim, Kyle Mooney, Melissa Villaseñor and Fortune Feimster.

	











	Crego hopes to create a classic family film that every generation can enjoy together in the theater, but his guiding principle was to maintain the key elements of the series, which often sees Gabby breaking the fourth wall to speak with the audience or encourage dancing and sing-alongs to the catchy soundtrack. (Pre-released songs “Kaleidoscope,” “Gabby Dollhouse World” and “Pinching In” are already available.)


	In fact, the Gabby filmgoing experience, like the series, wants active participation from viewers.


	“We tried really hard to make sure that the core audience of Gabby fans was going to be served first and foremost,” Crego says. “As much as I talk about how the parents are going to love it and adults are going to get something out of it, before anything, it was about the fans of Gabby and finding all the things that make the series so successful, and then bringing more to the screen for a bigger adventure.”


	So Kraner encourages moviegoers of all ages to keep that spirit alive. “Sometimes in movie theaters you're not really supposed to get up, but this is not that case. It's totally allowed!” she says.


	“A big part of the movie theater experience that is so special about Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie is that you're encouraged to go and sing and dance,” she continues. “That's always such a big part of the show that everybody really connects with, so being able to do that in a theater of other little Gabby fans is going to be such a blast. I hope everybody gets dressed up and brings their cat ears. It's supposed to be a fun and inclusive movie experience. The viewer has always been part of the story with Gabby and that's even more important in this movie. We want you to laugh and dance with us.”

Control of the venue is at the heart of a countersuit filed against Insomniac Events by three Miami club operators.


The legal battle between dance music giant Insomniac Events and a trio of Miami club operators is heating up with a new countersuit that accuses Insomniac and its CEO Pasquale Rotella of “predatory tactics and greed.”


	The dispute stems from a soured partnership between Insomniac, the global dance music events company partly owned by Live Nation, and Miami club and festival operators David Sinopoli, Davide L. Danese and Jose Gabriel Coloma Cano, who are best known for operating the city's famed Club Space venue and their work on the city's III Points festival.


	Insomniac brought a lawsuit last month against Sinopoli, Danese and Coloma Cano (referred to as “CDD” in legal papers), claiming the group tried to “bully” its way into more control over upstart Miami club Factory Town. But in counterclaims filed Wednesday (Sept. 24), CDD says it's actually Insomniac and Rotella who brought down their partnership with bad faith business practices. The countersuit is seeking unspecified monetary damages.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Insomniac and Rotella's deceit in the Factory Town partnership and their failure to abide by the settlement agreement are unfortunately only the latest instances of Insomniac and Rotella's unscrupulous business dealings and conduct,” reads the countersuit. “Rotella and Insomniac are well-known in the electronic music industry for their greed and mistreatment of business partners, colleagues and employees alike.” 


	The countersuit cites social media comments critiquing Insomniac, as well as a 2012 criminal indictment that charged Rotella with bribing an event manager at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The charges were later dismissed, with Rotella pleading no contest to a misdemeanor conflict of interest and getting probation.


	“Rotella is not just a criminal and a fraud. He is also insufferable to work with,” write CDD's lawyers. “The CDD parties have had the misfortune of witnessing and experiencing first-hand Rotella's cruelty, self-centeredness and volatility towards his business partners and/or employees.”


	Reached for comment on these new counterclaims on Wednesday, Insomniac's attorney Jordan Shaw says he's confident in their legal position and that CDD's personal attacks are irrelevant.


	“Their counterclaim is exactly what we expected, and the fact that they're relying on social media posts and dropped charges from 20 years ago tells you everything you need to know about their current claims,” says Shaw.


	Insomniac's original lawsuit against CDD claims the promoters made “outrageous demands” last year for more money and control of Factory Town. But the countersuit tells a different story, saying Insomniac “methodically and unilaterally” stripped away CDD's financial and ownership rights with the aim of leaving the promoters “trapped and forced to accept ever-worsening conditions.”  


	According to CDD, the original Factory Town agreement promised them a 49% stake in the venue. But the counterclaim says “Insomniac's and Rotella's actual intent was to gain full control of the Factory Town venue, obtain a lease for the Factory Town property under only Insomniac's name, and then unilaterally rewrite the deal under which the CDD Parties had performed and under which the CDD Parties exceeded all expectations, leaving the CDD Parties with all the work, all the risk, and a drastically reduced upside.”


	The two sides went into mediation this summer and emerged with a settlement, under which Insomniac would buy out CDD for $3 million and assume control of Factory Town. The Insomniac lawsuit alleges the CDD parties have since breached this settlement agreement by interfering in its planning of Factory Town's Hocus Pocus Halloween party and programming for Art Basel Miami in December.


	The countersuit, however, claims Insomniac was actually required to collaborate with CDD on both Hocus Pocus and Art Basel under the settlement. CDD says Insomniac has breached the deal by booking talent without their approval and ignoring myriad emails from CDD, copies of which are included in the suit. 


	In one example, CDD claims Insomniac made an offer to party brand CircoLoco “that represented a 44% increase from the prior year's deal.” CDD objected to this offer, saying that it did “not reflect historical performance, venue capacity, or the reality of our shared structure.” The countersuit alleges that subsequent emails about the details of this deal were ignored by Insomniac.


	CDD's lead attorney, Bruce Weil, said in a statement on Wednesday that his clients have “established themselves as respected and valuable members of Miami's community through years of supporting local artists and boosting the local economy.”


	“It is disappointing that Pasquale Rotella and Insomniac are manipulating the facts by accusing CDD of the exact misconduct they themselves have inflicted, while retaliating against Club Space by attempting to obstruct and undermine CDD's ability to operate and manage it during a period of unprecedented success,” Weil added.


	Insomniac lawyer Shaw, meanwhile, maintains that the language of the settlement agreement and orders from the dispute's mediator, retired judge Michael A. Hanzman, support Insomniac's reading of the agreement.


	“The facts are the facts,” said Shaw. “The Judge Hanzman order attached to the complaints says what it says, and the defendants cannot escape those realities no matter how many Twitter posts they quote in their counterclaim.”

					By Baz Bamigboye 

Columnist/International Editor At Large


EXCLUSIVE: Denis Villeneuve will embark on the search for an actor to play the world's most famous fictional spy, James Bond, next year when he completes production on Dune: Part Three. Those familiar with the matter tell us that the director and his collaborators are seeking a “fresh face” to take on the 007 mantle in Bond 26.


	Also, Bond … James Bond will be male, as written by creator Ian Fleming, and importantly, will be an actor who hails from the British isles. 


	Yes, they want a Brit to play Bond.


	That rules out fanciful speculation that the likes of Timothée Chalamet, Glen Powell, Austin Butler, Jacob Elordi and others who don't hail from UK shores are in the running.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Frankly, 99.9% of the names we've heard speculated online so far won't make the cut.


	Those in the know tell us the ideal approach is to cast “an unknown,” possibly in his late 20s or early 30s, to play what Fleming called “a blunt instrument” — the lethal but “extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened.”


	If that criteria is stuck to, that means favourites such as Tom Hardy, aged 47, Idris Elba at 53 and Henry Cavill, aged 42, presumably don't match what Villeneuve, producers David Heyman and Amy Pascal, and execs at Amazon MGM Studios are leaning towards.


	Also, consider that by the time Bond 26 begins shooting in 2027, both Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Jack Lowden will be 37 years of age. Will they be too old for Villeneuve?

	











	How rugged and imposing will this Bond be? Fleming describes Bond as being over 6 foot tall, even taller in his best Jermyn Street brogues. Daniel Craig is shorter than that.


	But have a think about Steven Knight's writing credits, a key source suggests, referring to the screenwriter picked to write the script for the Amazon MGM Studios production. 


	Knight's work includes SAS Rogue Heroes, Peaky Blinders and Eastern Promises, all of them featuring kick-ass, bone-crunching scenes. “Whoever it is, has to look like he could kill you with his bare hands in a trice. From the moment you see him, that has to be readily apparent,” a person close to discussions tells us.


	Online speculators and betting companies throw out names without thinking who Bond is. Knight will be going back to Fleming's earliest novels — Casino Royale (1953), Live and Let Die (1954), Moonraker (1955), Diamonds Are Forever (1956), From Russia, with Love (1957), Doctor No (1958) and Goldfinger (1959) — to help remind us who Fleming's protagonist is. Might the new Bond be more in the mould of a younger Sean Connery who originated 007 in 1962's Dr. No?


	There's a sense from the many conversations I've had that Knight's going back to Bond's beginnings as a Royal Navy Commander before being recruited by MI6, the UK's foreign intelligence agency, to perhaps chart how Bond attained 007 status. I want to stress that this is what I'm hearing but to caution that none of this is confirmed or fully formed because the script is still being written and the direction of travel is still up for grabs.


	Could Bond be played by a non Caucasian, I asked sources? He could, came the reply. As always, well, nearly always, it'll come down to this: Are they right for Bond? Are they right for the story that Villeneuve and screenwriter Knight will be telling?


	While we're here, it's worth pointing out the obvious: Bond 26 will not take up where No Time to Die, the final iteration in the franchise under Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, left us; with Bond dead. “It's a new Bond, a new start, a fresh everything,” is how it was put to me by a key source who adds that it's unlikely many associated with the past Bond regime will be involved with Bond 26. That said, I suspect a few old Bond hands might well be consulted on the quiet in the snug of a private club in Pall Mall, London.


	An unprecedented number of applicants have already sent in their pitch to play James Bond to the production. “Every name you've heard of, and many you've never heard of,” a well-placed mole revealed. “We've been flooded. But understand that the casting process has not begun and it won't until Denis finishes the Dune movie,” they continued.


	It pays to remember that  Craig, who, although famous to those of us who followed his career on stage and in independent and Hollywood movies, was not a household name when he was picked to play Fleming's approved British government assassin. I know that Broccoli knew of Craig's theater history but it wasn't until she saw Matthew Vaughn's Layer Cake that she became convinced he should be cast for Casino Royale. 

	











	British actors in their mid 20s to early 30s, with stellar acting chops, who fit the Bond mould, are going to be under an intense spotlight for the next 12 months. Bond … James Bond is somewhere out there.


	Our sources indicate that the film will be released in 2028 with filming due to take place in 2027. There's a lot of talk about the movie premiering in the November slot favored by past Bond movies.


	By the way, just because Bond will be British, it doesn't mean that other roles, such as the Bond foe and the actress leads, can't be performed by non-Brits, as has been the case for eons.

Why must British characters almost always have to be played by British people, but quintessentially American characters and even historical figures whose entire existences are defined by being American are up for grabs for everyone in the Anglosphere?

I've been wondering the same exact thing!  We had a Brit playing Martin Luther King,  Abraham Lincoln, Richard Nixon, (all REAL people in history), and not to mention the plethora of other non-historical roles like Batman, Spiderman, etc… but yet, when it comes to a FAKE character like James Bond, the actor just HAS to be British?? Make that make sense! 

Don't get me wrong, I think James Bond should be played by a Brit, but I just find the double standard really interesting, that's all.

Aaron Pierre will be 33 in 2027.

Dude, who cares about an origin story. We just went through that with the Craig cycle of films. I get this new film is, perhaps more than at any point in the series' history, an actual full on restart, with the Broccoli family taking a back seat, but why do we need to go down the young Bond route again? 

Who cares how he “became” 007; who cares about his youth. Just give us an already established Bond, in an already established world, in a fun globe trotting adventure. Enough with having to explore backstories and uncover every single stone.

Patrick Gibson, or Ed Speleers

Hope the character is still sauve with a sense of humor.

The wise choice is to study Flemings original stories and build from there, give us the true Bond ignore the parody's and misinterpretations.

Robert Sr. may not be seen on camera with Mary Cosby, but he plays a crucial role in helping their son navigate his addiction journey. In the second episode of Season 6 of “Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,” Mary opened up about how the family has been pulling together for the greater good.

In Episode 2, Mary's son is the topic as the castmates sit around a campfire in an RV park. The reality star then shared that her husband has played a crucial role in Robert Cosby Jr.'s sobriety, especially after he had completed a 30-day rehab program.

“He's doing as well as he can be doing. He's taking it day by day, trying. He has highs and lows. Some days he's good, some days he's not, you know?” Mary explained. “I didn't have a support system with him; I just had Robert Sr. I just have one. I couldn't have done it without Robert Sr. I couldn't have done it at all.”

Mary took some time during a confessional to explain the situation in more detail. “When Robert Jr. got home [from rehab], we had a talk with him and Robert Sr. told him, ‘We cannot babysit you. You have the tools, and you know what you need to do.' So, we, like, made a pact that we would take one day at a time, and we're letting him figure it out. And that's how I deal with him.”

Dealing with Robert Jr.'s recovery has led Mary to reflect on her parenting style, which has helped her refine her strategy moving forward.

“I feel like his whole life, I've always been that helicopter mom, and I feel like that drove him to be, like, not wanting to let me down, so not telling me the truth,” she explains. “I felt like it's actually changed me to back off and let him see that I trust that he's going to make the right decision. Because it's like, you have to do it; we can't do it for you.”

Also in Episode 2, Robert Jr. had an honest talk with his mother, and he admitted to some post-rehab struggles. 

“I feel like I'm at a standstill right now,” he said during an Episode 2 heart-to-heart. “I'm not in that dark place, but, like, it's still there, if that makes sense. … I just didn't expect it to be like this. It's like you have to change who you are as a person. Like, you're so used to doing something you do every day and it's a ritual, and then you just come back home to where you used to do that ritual and you're not doing it anymore.”

Robert admitted to feeling isolated after rehab, because he was avoiding all of the friends with whom he had previously partied. 

“I don't ever want you to feel isolated. I don't,” she told her son. “But I also want you to understand why it's necessary to isolate yourself from the people that you bonded with over drugs. Every day is not easy. Sometimes you fall, but you get back up. We're fighters. We fight.”

Prior to Apple's announcement delaying “The Savant‘s” release date from Friday, September 26 to God knows when, anyone not directly involved in said announcement likely couldn't say whether “The Savant” is a movie, a TV show, or a new form of artificial intelligence. Even if they could pinpoint the slippery descriptor as a limited series destined for Apple TV+ (the “S” title is a dead giveaway), they certainly couldn't have told you what the series is about. 

Now, that's changed. Search traffic spiked on Tuesday around 4 p.m. ET, when stories first ran about Apple postponing Jessica Chastain‘s dramatic thriller, and it jumped yet again after the star and executive producer took to Instagram on Wednesday to state she's “not aligned” with the streamer's decision. 

 








Related Stories Jessica Chastain Says She's ‘Not Aligned' with Apple on ‘The Savant' Delay Jimmy Kimmel Made Himself Unassailable — Will That Be Enough? 

Suddenly, people are buzzing about “The Savant.” They want to know what about the show caused Apple to pull the plug a mere three days prior to release. They want to know the reason why they made their choice, since the company gave zero context in their statement to the press. (“After careful consideration” is as close as they get to signaling a motive.) They want to know what's going on, and in the absence of context, they'll fill in the gaps with worst-case scenarios.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Is Apple kowtowing to the Trump administration by burying a series that dares to depict white supremacists as a national security threat? Is it worried about bad-faith commentators claiming the show's fictionalized political violence is ill-timed and insensitive given recent real-life political violence?  Is the streamer afraid of offending hate groups by depicting them as hateful and/or groups? 

With no knowledge of what went into Apple's decision, I'm not going to make any claims on the company's behalf, but having seen all eight episodes of “The Savant' (in preparation for a review that will not be published today, as originally planned), I'm inclined to believe the simplest explanation is the correct one:

We're living in a particularly prickly cultural climate, “The Savant” features storylines that allude to proven flashpoints, and Apple got skittish. 

First and foremost, what they're doing is far from unprecedented. Even if the move seems suspicious in light of recent examples of corporate censorship and greed, “The Savant's” delay (assuming it's just a delay) is in line with standard network self-regulation. Recent instances include when Paramount Network delayed its “Heathers” reboot twice in 2018 after mass shootings occurred close to both scheduled release dates; USA Network pushed back “Shooter” from a summer release to the fall after repeated attacks on police officers; “The Last Ship,” “Mr. Robot,” and even “Documentary Now!” all delayed episodes due to mass shootings, as well. 

 










In case you noticed a disturbing patten in that last paragraph, yes, it would be easy to argue there's never a safe time to release a program involving mass shootings (or planned mass shootings) because America suffers from a plague of gun violence. So why not just put “The Savant” out as planned, rather than risk the same thing happening again on whatever future date is chosen?

Well, as previously mentioned, the current climate is particularly charged, and Apple is a sensitive giant. Apple TV+ is just one part of a massive, worldwide conglomerate, and the streamer was nearly scared off of theatrical releases by headlines labeling their movies as box office bombs. So it's reasonable to assume executives would be even more skittish of headlines claiming one of their shows inflamed an already red-hot socio-political situation. 

If they're unhappy with “Argylle” associating them with perceived failure, how would they feel if “The Savant” associated them with actual tragedy?

“OK, sure,” you may say, “but shouldn't they have thought of that before they decided to make it?” Another fair point, and I'm not here to carry a trillion-dollar tech company's water, but Apple should still be doing everything it can to position their projects for success, and shifting the release date is part of that strategy. Not only might a fresh date give “The Savant” a better shot at finding a wider audience, it also avoids putting its cast and crew in the center of a conversation they didn't necessarily sign up to have — especially if that conversation is being led by disingenuous firebrands with major platforms (coughFoxNewscough), and especially if that conversation involves malicious racists and misogynists who are ready and willing to dox their enemies into oblivion (as depicted in the series).

 










Without stepping on the toes of a review that will run at a later date, “The Savant” is far from incendiary. It largely avoids concrete political associations in favor of implications via familiar archetypes, and it's not surfacing any issues that haven't been apparent for years, if not decades. (It's based on a six-year-old Cosmopolitan story, which honors its subject in the way Chastain said she hopes the series does, too — and which is still available to read online, right now, for free.) I can't imagine these episodes will change anyone's points of view on politics, gun violence, or whatever prejudices they already feel. It's simply not that kind of big, ambitious show, like all the ongoing bluster makes it out to be.

But none of that means it couldn't turn into a cultural powder keg. We've seen infernos start from much less, so why not err on the side of caution? Maybe I'm wrong and Apple is more afraid of Trump's ire than the public's reaction. Maybe I'm very wrong and Apple is using tragic current events to drum up awareness for a show no one had heard of a few days ago. (Again, that is not what I believe is happening — did I mention Apple is sensitive to criticism?) 

If this delay turns into a cancelation, we'll have to revisit this conversation. (Shelving an entire show for good would certainly matter.) But as it stands, there are more reasons to believe Apple made a fair call than a foul one. 

 










Once everyone's had a chance to see the series, it's my firm belief we'll all go back to not thinking about “The Savant,” just like we weren't before.

There are things, inanimate objects, that are difficult to forget. The wig that a revolutionary pulls low over her skull when she suspects a man in the grocery store is a mercenary looking for her; when she flees through a back door and is shot in the side of the head, it pops off like a toy snake from a canister. The blanket, wrapped tightly around a baby, and its flourishes of red embroidery looking eerily like speckles of blood. The white zip ties, the black SUVs. The cover page of a witness-protection agreement, taped to the window of a suburban home, amended in Sharpie: “THIS PUSSY DON'T POP FOR YOU.”

Over the past decade or so, there's been a lot written about how our major commercial auteurs, many of them white men around Paul Thomas Anderson's age, have avoided making movies set in the present day. Instead, they retreat into a past without phones or the internet and whose politics have yet to be bludgeoned into hyperlegibility. Depending on how you look at it, that argument is now underlined by—or ends with—One Battle After Another, Anderson's monumental tenth film. Based on Thomas Pynchon's Vineland but transposed to the present, it's acutely attuned to America today: the unchecked power, the unmarked cars, the quasigenocidal bend toward biological determinism. And for its frequent infusions of absurdist comedy, that word, Battle, in the title, is sincere. Those aforementioned items—like the homemade transponders that occasionally work and the bombs that always do—are unambiguously the detritus of war.

One Battle follows another ex-revolutionary (Leonardo DiCaprio), now holed up outside a fictional Northern California town and almost perpetually drunk or high, but otherwise doting on his teenage daughter (newcomer Chase Infiniti). In the present, they're Bob and Willa Ferguson, fake names assumed 16 years ago when the French 75, a revolutionary network for which Bob was a munitions expert, was forced to scatter. The catalyst for the group's disbandment was the capture and looming grand jury testimony of Perfidia (Teyana Taylor), Willa's mother. Willa is aware of the contours of her parents' past lives: She's been taught a series of code phrases and instructed to trust her life to any stranger who says them to her; she knows to carry her transponder; she knows she has to hide her iPhone from her father because he would tell her it is traceable.

Published in 1990, Vineland was about the splintering of the radical movements from the two decades prior. While Pynchon satirizes the overwhelming power of the state, he's also incisive about the ways people rationalize their drift toward the establishment, their willingness to turn on their friends, and the palliative appeal of suburban calm.

One Battle is updated for blunter times. After Perfidia's arrest, every member of the French 75 is killed or pushed underground. The Fergusons are pursued by one Col. Steven J. Lockjaw (Sean Penn), whose Vineland analogue is magnetic, appealing, persuasive, but here is merely evil, a brutal instrument and embodiment of an openly bloodthirsty power structure. In the opening act, he rapes Perfidia; when he marshals dozens of soldiers to lay siege to a small town in service of a pet project, there's no sense that he has to convince his superiors. This is hell, and if he's not in charge, he's in lockstep with those who are.

Despite that notable change, watching One Battle After Another is much like the experience of reading Pynchon, who lurches from high comedy to stomach-turning naturalism and punctuates plot-heavy sequences with little grace notes of character portraiture. Here, Anderson opens with the liberation of an immigrant-detention center at the U.S.-Mexican border, depicts numerous shooting deaths, and has images of displaced children huddling on cement floors and scurrying through tunnels—but also depicts a network of wealthy and powerful white nationalists who call themselves the Christmas Adventurers. He's able to stitch these seemingly disparate pieces together through sheer command of craft: thoughtful pacing, portentous editing, and a sense of mounting dread that is maintained and accelerated by the singular, almost ever-present Jonny Greenwood score.

One Battle is primarily a film about race. The French 75 is largely Black: Beyond Taylor's Perfidia, operatives and allies are played Wood Harris, Regina Hall, Starletta DuPois, and the musicians Dijon and Junglepussy, among others. During his time as an active member, Bob was known as “Ghetto Pat,” and retains a penchant for calling people “homie”; when he and Perfidia are making out in the back of a sedan as it speeds away from the detention center, he's goaded into saying just how much he loves “Black girls.” Lockjaw, who spent years lusting after Perfidia, is so ideologically committed to white supremacy that when he seeks initiation into the Adventurers, he plans to find and kill Willa for fear that she's his daughter. The math here is clear: The fetishization of Black women spans the entire political spectrum, from those sincerely seeking Black liberation to those who would like to see Black people killed en masse.

But this observation is only a starting point. One Battle shows solidarity across lines of race and class, but also the friction inherent to those alliances. When, during the siege, Bob is taken in by his daughter's martial arts instructor, Sensei Sergio (Benecio del Toro), the latter's unflappability is played for laughs. But Sergio's cool efficiency as he directs dozens of undocumented children to safety makes Bob's panic over the whereabouts of his daughter, confirmed to be safe with people he trusts, seem at least a little solipsistic. Bob's almost tearful lament, from later in the film, that he can't properly do his daughter's hair, is heartbreaking.

Elsewhere, characters wield whatever power race gives them—however uneasily. Lockjaw imprisons and murders people with impunity, but is made insecure around the Adventurers by the fact he's been sexually fixated on those they, and he, have deemed impure. A monologue about Black power is fearfully made manifest by a gunshot in a bank robbery. And, in the wrenching sequence where Perfidia leaves Bob and Willa, she expresses disgust at the way white revolutionaries have to be coddled and carried along. It has the sting of truth—but is undercut by the sorrow Taylor masterfully layers below Perfidia's rage.

We are, in fact, living in an age of “identity politics,” but in the sense that people are shunted into camps, jails, or coffins based on the color of their skin. And so it's truly ingenious that one of One Battle's tensest sequences sees a portable paternity test deployed in a chapel. The myopia required to derive true meaning from such a thing—barely more sophisticated than phrenology—is staggering. But it's the logical endpoint of the belief that some people are chattel and others are entitled to use them as they please. Later, after Willa screams at Lockjaw about her mother (“She was a rat!”), he's practically salivating when he responds: “She was a warrior.”

Infiniti is asked to play the put-upon daughter of a man-child father, a scared child, a phony among true believers, and eventually, a reluctant killer. She acquits herself unbelievably well. The adrenaline-soaked shriek she lets out after shooting and killing the IZOD-clad Adventurer who had been pursuing her in a superb highway chase sequence is nearly on par with Jena Malone's yelp of joy that serves as the thesis at the end of Anderson's Inherent Vice. DiCaprio, as the father who loves her more than anything but is aware of the limits of his use to her, has never been better.

A moment after that scream, Bob comes across the wreckage of the chase. When he sees Willa coiled behind a sign at the side of the road, he's overcome with relief. But she can't relax: she raises the pistol toward him and asks him to repeat back the code phrases. He doesn't. Instead, he reasons: I'm your dad. The gun comes down. She believes him—he is.

Jessica Chastain expressed her disappointment with Apple's decision to postpone the release of her upcoming limited series The Savant — about an undercover investigator who goes after online extremist groups — in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination.


AppleTV+ announced its decision to hold the show on Tuesday, Sept. 23, three days before its scheduled Sept. 26 premiere. A spokesperson said, “After careful consideration, we have made the decision to postpone The Savant. We appreciate your understanding and look forward to releasing the series at a future date” (via The Hollywood Reporter).


	In a statement shared on social media the following day, Chastain wrote, “I want to say how much I value my partnership with Apple. They've been incredible collaborators and I deeply respect their team. That said, I wanted to reach out and let you know that we're not aligned on the decision to pause the release of The Savant.” 


	While AppleTV+ did not mention Kirk or cite any specific reasons behind its decision, it's widely believed that it stemmed from concerns over the show's content in relation to recent events. Based on descriptions of the series, there are no plot lines or characters that directly parallel Kirk or his death, but the show does contend with online extremism and political violence. 

	











	But as Chastain seemed to suggest in her statement, Kirk's death isn't necessarily an isolated act of political violence. “In the last five years since we've been making the show, we've seen an unfortunate amount of violence in the United States,” Chastain wrote, going on to mention everything from the attempted kidnapping of Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and January 6, to the Trump assassination attempt, as well as the assassinations of Kirk and two Democratic representatives in Minnesota. 

	











	“These incidents, though far from encompassing the full range of violence witnessed in the United States, illustrate a broader mindset that crosses the political spectrum and must be confronted,” Chastain wrote. “I've never shied away from difficult subjects, and while I wish this show wasn't so relevant, unfortunately it is.”

	She ended her statement by saying, “The Savant is about the heroes who work every day to stop violence before it happens, and honoring their courage feels more urgent than ever. While I respect Apple's decision to pause the release for now, I remain hopeful the show will reach audiences soon. Until then, I'm wishing safety and strength for everyone, and I'll let you know if and when The Savant is released.”


	A new release date for The Savant hasn't been shared yet. A page for the show on the streamer lists it as “Coming at a later date.”

Make of this 0:46 sample of cellphone video what you will. Diehard UFO skeptics like Neil deGrasse Tyson love to dismiss the entire phenomenon with casual shake of the head and a ""Where's the footage?"" Arguing that since every human has a camera in their pocket, we should be lousy with definitive, irrefutable photographic proof that these things people have been reporting since Biblical days actually exist. But when you present something like this, it's just excused as a hoax or a weather balloon or something. Anything short of a craft landing in the infield of Churchill Downs on Derby Day and announcing their presence will no do. And even then, they'd question whether it was just part of a stunt to sell Kentucky bourbon or something. 

As far as this footage, even an expert in the field is passing it off as something possibly even more far-fetched than an actual spacecraft from an actual alien world. But in fact, one of ours:

Daily Mail -  A pair of Los Angeles residents were on their balcony when they spotted a black, V-shaped craft covered in lights moving slowly over the city on August 28.

The sighting went on for roughly 25 minutes ...

UFO researcher and filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee told the Daily Mail he believes the craft was not an alien spaceship, adding it was likely an unmanned drone testing out new technology for the US government or some other world power.

However, Lee made one stunning claim based on his analysis of this sighting and several famous UFO incidents throughout the UK, suggesting that the US military has created technology many would think was still only science fiction in 2025.

'I'm convinced that a lot of famous UFO incidents are basically highly advanced terrestrial technology that is 30 to 40 years ahead of what we think they have,' Lee explained.

Regardless of where the craft came from, it's the latest report of a strange V-shaped craft, or chevron, flying over the US in recent months. ...

[This] was the 34th chevron spotted throughout the country in 2025.

According to NUFORC, there have been several reports this year which specifically mention seeing a V-shaped wedge or triangle with multiple lights along its surface flying over the US.

I'll admit, Mark Christopher Lee is a UFO researcher and filmmaker, and I'm just a handsome intellectual who'd rather be chasing stories about possible interstellar craft hovering above our cities than contemplate how we live in a world gone mad. And maybe it's a plausible hypothesis. The fact there have been 34 reported sightings of such V-shaped craft just in the less than nine months of The Year of Our Lord 2025 might indicate these are new pieces of highly advance aerospace tech the government hasn't told us about yet. And we've had similar encounters in the past few years. Like this one:





After all, we didn't know the B-2 Stealth Bomber existed until, like the Death Star, it was full operational. And certainly the people who lived in Hiroshima in 1945 were caught off guard by what Oppenheimer had been working on for years. So maybe these sightings and these videos are all just part of a slow rollout. Could be. Who knows?

There's just one problem with Lee's explanation. If he's saying this is a new technology that's 30-40 years ahead of its time, he's at least 30-40 years too late:

…  which many witnesses believed to be of extraterrestrial origin. Thousands of people across multiple States saw the lights. The military tried explaining the sighting away by suggesting that the lights were likely flares as part of a military exercise. However, most witnesses dispute this claim as the lights they saw were too large and too stationary to be flares.



As I mentioned in that blog I posted above, one of the thousands who saw those lights over Phoenix was the Governor of Arizona, who reported it, then made a joke out of it, then disavowed his report, until eventually admitting he did, in fact see what he saw. Way too late for the other eyewitnesses who were mocked and ridiculed for being honest about what they saw. 

The point being that if we're going to say what was in the skies over LA is just something we shouldn't have for another or so, then we have to go all the way and say human engineers had this same 2065 technology flying around over Phoenix in March of 1997. 

So it seems that even expert UFOlogists aren't above saying whatever it takes to keep the public from getting answers.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","What science says about leucovorin, the drug Trump touted for autism","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/24/health/leucovorin-drug-trump-autism","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 20:25:33 GMT","


            Six months ago, 4-year-old Jose Morales-Ortiz was struggling to say two-word sentences. Jose has severe autism, and he couldn't have a conversation and wouldn't answer to his name most of the time — all things that kids his age are supposed to be able to do.
    


            By the end of June, though, it was clear something had changed.
    


            Keith Joyce, his guardian, said Jose was able to tell him about the other kids at school and answer follow-up questions.
    


            “The first time I realized I'd had a conversation with him, I cried,” said Joyce, 60, of St. Paul, Minnesota, who has been raising Jose since he was a baby and calls him “my guy.”
    


            Joyce credits these milestones to leucovorin, a drug currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to ease the side effects of certain kinds of chemotherapy.
    


            On Monday, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said the agency would speed a label change for leucovorin to help kids with folate deficiency in their brains — something he said could cause developmental delays and features of autism, including difficulties with communication, sensory processing and repetitive behaviors. With the label change, state Medicaid programs will be able to cover it, and the administration has pledged to conduct more research on it as a therapy.
    


            “This gives hope to the many parents with autistic children that it may be possible to improve their lives,” President Donald Trump said at Monday's news conference. “That's one of the things that I'm very, very happy about.”
    


            At the same briefing, Trump also made unsupported claims about the painkiller Tylenol as a cause of autism and cautioned parents about getting too many vaccines for their kids.
    


            Trump's comments sparked widespread concern and criticism from many in the autism community. But there's some curiosity about a new use for the old drug, too.
    


            “A much higher standard of science would be needed to determine if leucovorin is an effective and safe treatment for autism,” the Autism Science Foundation said of the FDA's announcement. The group said it doesn't currently recommend the drug as a treatment for autism based on existing evidence, but “we welcome additional investigation into leucovorin.”
    


            The theory behind leucovorin is that it treats a condition called cerebral folate deficiency, or low folate levels in the brain. Folate is a B vitamin that's critical for neural development.
    


            Pregnant women take the synthetic form, folic acid, in prenatal vitamins. Folic acid is also used to fortify flour and grain products, to help prevent neural tube defects like spina bifida in the womb.
    


            In 2005, a pediatric neurologist in Germany discovered that some children with symptoms of autism had normal folate levels in their blood but low folate levels in their brains. These children also made antibodies – specialized Y-shaped proteins – that blocked the receptors, or gateways, that carry folate into the brain.
    


            In a subsequent study, 25 of 28 children with cerebral folate deficiency made these antibodies, while none of 28 typically developing children had them.  The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
    


            The German doctor worked with a cell biologist at SUNY-Downstate named Edward Quadros who had developed a blood test called FRAT, for Folate Receptor Autoantibody Test. That test has since been licensed to a private lab, and doctors can order it for about $300.
    


            Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist in private practice in Phoenix, Arizona, was intrigued by the research and began testing kids who came through his clinic.
    


            “We showed that about 75% of the kids with autism have this folate receptor alpha that blocks the ability of folate to get into the nervous system,” Frye said.  “And we treated them with leucovorin and showed that their language improved, their verbal communication improved.”
    


            In a clinical trial published in 2013, Frye found that one-third of treated children saw moderate to much improvement compared with a control group of children who were on a waiting list for this therapy, “mostly in communication, verbal communication, expressive speech, receptive language and such,” he said.
    


            Frye was able to repeat those findings in another study published a few years later. His results have been confirmed in small clinical trials in France, India, Singapore, China and Iran.
    


            Frye is still cautious, though. 



            “There's no autism pill,” he said. “And there's no one-size-fits-all. The one thing we know about autism is that it's very complicated, and kids need to be taken individually.”
    


            Joyce, Jose's guardian, first read about leucovorin in December, but there wasn't much to go on — just a handful of small studies.
    


            He said he's constantly on the lookout for new science or medicine that can help Jose, who is in school and specialized therapy for 65 hours a week, but he was wary. It took three months before he even asked Jose's doctor about the drug.
    


            “I completely believe in the whole scientific method,” Joyce said, and there simply wasn't enough science to support its use for children with autism.
    


            But it's also a very safe medicine. It's a high dose form of vitamin B9, so the body flushes out what it doesn't use.
    


            Joyce eventually thought it might be worth a trial but couldn't get an off-label prescription for Jose until a specialized developmental pediatrician who Jose sees, who had just been to a conference where it was discussed, agreed it had promise.
    


            Because the medication is pretty safe, they decided to forgo the antibody test – which wasn't covered by their insurance – and just give the drug a try.
    


            Jose had a baseline speech assessment in April so they would be able to measure whether the medication was helping. Within a couple months, though, the changes were so noticeable, nobody felt like the follow-up test was necessary.
    


            “We went in for a follow-up four months later, and the changes were so dramatic,” Joyce said. The doctor was blown away. “She was just like, ‘Wow!'”
    


            There have been no large placebo-controlled trials of leucovorin for autism, as would typically be required by the FDA before it approves a drug. In some cases, the effects – which were measured over a few weeks or months – seem modest, said Dr. David Mandell, who directs the Penn Center for Mental Health at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.
    


            Mandell says the most rigorous study, from China, “finds a one-point change, on average, in on a 60-point scale in favor of leucovorin. So like a tiny, really not clinically significant change.”
    


            Still, Mandell agrees that the medication is pretty safe. The most common side effects in kids are stomach issues like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and loss of appetite. Children with autism may already be prone to these kinds of issues, so he says that needs to be watched.
    


            More seriously, he said, kids with autism who also take certain medications for seizures may see an increase in those seizures if they take leucovorin. The use of this medication needs to be monitored by a doctor.
    


            Frye also said leucovorin can also intensify hyperactivity and behavioral issues.
    


            That happened to a degree with Jose, Joyce said. “He's definitely more hyper and more active than he was, but it's within tolerable limits.”
    


            For a while, it also made daily life overwhelming.
    


            At soccer practice, for example, Jose would go out onto the field but come off five minutes later and not be able to re-engage.
    


            “Our theory is that his world grew so big, so fast, he was having a problem digesting it,” Joyce said, adding that it doesn't happen so much anymore.
    


            In a news release Monday, the FDA said it had conducted its own review of scientific evidence for leucovorin and concluded it was enough to change the label of the drug to indicate that it could help children with low levels of folate in their brains.
    


            “Children are suffering and deserve access to potential treatments that have shown promise. We are using gold standard science and common sense to deliver for the American people,” Makary said in a statement.
    


            The agency has not made its scientific review available to the public, however.
    


            “The FDA will release its review of the data and will publish a manuscript in the near future,” said Andrew Nixon, director of communications for the US Department of Health and Human Services, in a statement to CNN.
    


            He said the FDA also intends to issue updated prescribing information for the drug that will include “the essential scientific information needed for the safe and effective use of these drug products for the treatment of cerebral folate deficiency in adults and pediatric patients.”
    


            From his own review, Mandell at the University of Pennsylvania said that the evidence behind leucovorin for autism doesn't rise to the level of “gold-standard science” and that the approval for autism is dangerous on a couple of levels: First, because it sets a dangerous precedent for drug approvals, and second, because it could be giving false hope to desperate families.
    


            If the FDA grants a new indication for leucovorin, as it has said that it intends to do, it would be the first time that's happened for a drug with such a small amount of evidence behind it, said a former FDA official who declined to be named because they feared retaliation from the Trump administration.
    


            “The hypocrisy of what's going on here, of saying that you want to use gold-standard science and then using the lowest standard of junk science, I mean, this is a really low standard to make a major sweeping change. It should not be lost on people,” the official said.
    


            The announcement of the drug approval in a high-profile White House news conference may also push people to experiment on their own, without guidance from a doctor or the FDA.
    


            In May, Joyce started a Facebook group called “Leucovorin for Autism” to share his research into leucovorin and answer questions in case other parents wanted their children to try it. Since the White House announcement, it has gained more than 10,000 members.
    


            He has noticed a worrying trend: people rushing to buy over-the-counter folinic acid supplements, which are different from the prescription version and contain only micrograms of its active ingredient.
    


            In clinical trials, children were dosed leucovorin based on their weight but could take up to 50 milligrams per day.
    


            Some of the supplements “have as little as 800 micrograms (0.8 milligrams) of folinic acid, leading to having to take a lot to get a therapeutic dose,” Joyce said.
    


            The supplements may also have additives or extra ingredients that kids are getting in big doses, which could cause problems, he added.
    


            The group has a rule, Joyce said: no talking about the causes of autism. He said he spent part of the day on Tuesday deleting posts and mean comments about the painkiller Tylenol.
    


            “I'm trying to ignore the source and thankful for the attention,” he said.
    


            He's also hopeful for Jose, who has had improvements in communication and in learning since starting the drug.
    


            Before, when Joyce would take Jose to a Minnesota Loons soccer game, the child would hyperfocus on the field, rarely looking up to notice the crowd around him.
    


            But this summer, Jose began to pay attention to the fans' chants during the game and watched when people waved their scarves.
    


            “I was just like, ‘Wow, he knows the world's here,' ” Joyce said.

A migrant detainee has died after a gunman opened fire at an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) facility in Texas.

The shooter, who used bullets scrawled with the phrase “anti-ICE”, died at the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The gunman is thought to have fired the shots at about 7am, from the roof of a building adjacent to the ICE field centre.

Todd Lyons, the ICE director, said preliminary information suggested that there was a “possible sniper”.

Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Joseph Rothrock, the head of the Texas FBI field office, said: “I could also share with you is that early evidence that we've seen from rounds that were found near the suspected shooter contain messages that are anti-ICE in nature.”

On Wednesday afternoon, the DHS issued a correction, stating it was just one migrant who had died. DHS officials had earlier said that two detainees had died. 

Thanks for tuning in to our live blog after a gunman opened fire at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas, killing one.

One migrant detainee died after a gunman opened fire at an ICE facility in Texas.

Earlier on Wednesday, the Department for Homeland Security said two had died before issuing a correction.

Another person was injured and taken to hospital.

Kash Patel, the FBI director, has labelled the shooting a “despicable, politically motivated” attack against law enforcement.

“While the investigation is ongoing, an initial review of the evidence shows an idealogical motive behind this attack,” he wrote.

“One of the unspent shell casings recovered was engraved with the phrase “ANTI ICE.” More updates will be forthcoming. These despicable, politically motivated attacks against law enforcement are not a one-off.”

Senator Ted Cruz warned that demonising ICE officers fuels political violence.

“Politician demanding that ICE agents be doxed and calling for people to go after their families: stop,” he told the press conference.

“Violence has no place. It is wrong, and we should come together.”

He added that the correct place to debate immigration policy was in Congress, not by condemning government agents doing their jobs.

“If we want to have a debate about immigration policies. We can do so in the halls of Congress without demonising each other, and especially without demonising the men and women who every day put on a badge.”

 

Senator Ted Cruz has issued a message of unity, warning that political violence “must stop”.

Speaking at the press conference, he said: “This needs to stop. Violence is wrong. Politically motivated violence is wrong.

“It was two weeks ago today that we saw a political assassination in Utah that tore the heart out of much of this country.”

In a swipe at political leaders who have weaponised recent acts of violence for their own political agendas, he said: “To every politician who is using rhetoric demonising ICE and demonising CBP: stop.”

Bullets found next to the gunman who carried out today's shooting were inscribed with anti-ICE messages, the FBI said.

Joseph Rothrock, the head of the Texas FBI field office, said: “I could also share with you is that early evidence that we've seen from rounds that were found near the suspected shooter contain messages that are anti ice in nature. 

“Again, this is just the most recent example of this type of attack.”

He added that the FBI is treating the attack as an “act of targeted violence”.

Daniel Comeaux, the Dallas police chief, said that four people were shot, including the shooter.

The Dallas mayor has called for calm from his constituents as rumours swirl over the killer's motive.

Speaking at the press conference, Eric Johnson said: “Let's be patient. Let's remain calm, and let's let our law enforcement partners, our police department, do their job. 

“This is an active investigation. There's still a lot of unanswered questions, and I want to encourage all of you to exercise a little bit of restraint and allow them to do their job.”

A press conference has started in Dallas Texas with Mayor Eric Johnson urging his constituents to pray for those affected by the shooting.

“Join me also in praying for this city that we can come together at a time like this,” he said.

The shooting at an ICE facility will not slow the deportation of illegal migrants, Texas governor Greg Abbott has said.

Mr Abbott said that the state “fully supports” ICE agents and is working to get to the bottom of the gunman's motive.

Texas fully supports ICE 💯Both the Texas Dept. of Public Safety & Texas National Guard work closely with ICE.This assassination will NOT slow our arrest, detention, & deportation of illegal immigrants.We will work with ICE & the Dallas Police Dept. to get to the bottom of…

Migrants who had appointments at the ICE facility have been turned away in the wake of this morning's shooting, according to reports.

This morning's shooting took place at an ICE field office rather than a detention centre.

An ICE field office is an administrative office for agency staff, whereas detention centres are secure facilities used for holding migrants.

The Dallas field office has four holding cells and detainees are processed there before being transferred to a detention facility according to CNN. 

At least one detainee was killed in the attack, and no agents were injured, officials said.

Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, earlier updated her post on X to reflect that it was in fact a field office that was targeted.

Wednesday's shooting comes at a tense time in the US. Charlie Kirk, a conservative campaigner was shot dead while addressing a rally of students at Utah Valley University on Sept 10. President Donald Trump and his top team appeared in front of tens of thousands of people at a memorial service on Sunday, and the nation is on edge amid fears of more political violence.

Authorities are investigating whether today's shooter opened fire from a rooftop, as Kirk's alleged killer is believed to have done.  A man who shot at Mr Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year, also shot from a rooftop.ICE has also been a focal point for anger among Mr Trump's opponents who object to his massive deportation push.

Whatever the motives of the shooter turn out to be, the result is another surge in fears that the US could see more attacks.

Mike Pence, the former vice president, has blamed the Left for today's shooting.

“Praying for the victims and their families following the shooting at @ICEgov field office in Dallas,” he wrote on X.

“The Left's targeting of our brave men and women in uniform MUST STOP NOW. God Bless All the Brave Men and Women of ICE.”

A motive for the attack has not been established and no ICE agents were hurt, officials have said. 

A press conference on this morning's shooting has been delayed.

The briefing was scheduled to take place at 3pm (9am local time), but microphones are still being set up.

It is expected to commence shortly.

JD Vance, the vice president, has linked the shooting to an “obsessive attack against law enforcement”.

No ICE agents were injured during the attack, officials have said, and at least one migrant was killed.

The obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop. I'm praying for everyone hurt in this attack and for their families. https://t.co/wEN3sqyGyQ

One person was killed and two hospitalised after the gunman opened fire at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas, the local police department said.

On September 24, 2025, at about 6:40 a.m., Dallas Police responded to an assist officer call in the 8100 block of north Stemmons Freeway. The preliminary investigation determined that a suspect opened fire at a government building from an adjacent building. Two people were…

The FBI is “fully engaged” in the investigation, Dan Bongino, the deputy director, has said.

Mr Bongino said the bureau is working “in conjunction with our state and federal law enforcement partners”.

The FBI is fully engaged, in conjunction with our state and federal law enforcement partners, at the crime scene in Dallas.

One migrant has been shot dead and multiple others injured by a “possible sniper” at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas.

The shooting unfolded at around 7am on Wednesday morning, multiple news outlets reported.

Police said one person had been killed and two injured after the gunman opened fire from a nearby building.

The suspected shooter is “down” from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, Immigration and Customs Enforcement director Todd Lyons told CNN.

“Preliminary information is a possible sniper,” Mr Lyons said.

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland security spokeswoman, has said that the agency is looking into the possibility that the suspected sniper fired from a nearby rooftop.

In a statement, homeland security secretary Kristi Noem said: “There was a shooting this morning at the Dallas @ICEgov Field Office.

“Details are still emerging but we can confirm there were multiple injuries and fatalities.

“The shooter is deceased by a self-inflicted gun shot wound.

“While we don't know motive yet, we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them. It must stop. “Please pray for the victims and their families.”

My team and I are closely monitoring the situation at the ICE Detention Facility in Dallas. We are praying for the swift recovery of those injured, and we are deeply grateful to the brave first responders who rushed to the scene. https://t.co/1BDJVrehre

Highway camera footage shared on X shows dozens of emergency service cars responding to the scene.

The Dallas ICE facility where a gunman opened fire this morning was targeted by a bomb threat in August.

On August 25, a man arrived at the facility and “claimed to have a bomb in his backpack”, according to a Department of Homeland Security statement.

“We've seen a lot of violence at ICE facilities, and this is not the first time that we've seen an attack, even this year at an ICE facility,” Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland security spokeswoman, told Fox News this morning.

The gunman who shot multiple people at an ICE facility in Dallas possibly opened fire from a nearby rooftop, officials have suggested.

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland security spokeswoman, has said that the agency is looking into the possibility that the suspected sniper fired from a nearby rooftop.

If confirmed, it would be the second high-profile shooting involving a sniper in recent weeks, after Charlie Kirk was killed by a single gunshot fired from a rooftop at a university event in Utah earlier this month.

Tyer Robinson has been charged with killing the prominent conservative activist.

No ICE officers were hurt in the shooting, an agency official has said.

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland security spokeswoman, confirmed to Fox News that ICE agents were not injured but that security at the site may have been.

She added that the investigation was a “fluid situation” and no motive has been identified.

Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security director, has warned that ICE facilities are facing ‘unprecedented violence'.

“While we don't know motive yet, we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them. It must stop. Please pray for the victims and their families,” she wrote on X.

This morning's attack marked at least the third instance of an ICE facility being targeted by gunfire in Texas this year, according to CNN.

In July, 10 suspects were charged for attacking an ICE detention centre in nearby Alvarado, Texas, killing an officer in the process.

The suspects were equipped with tactical gear and weapons, according to ICE.

The gunman who carried out the attack at an ICE facility is dead, officials said.

Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security director, said that the suspect had died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The shooter was described as a white male, police told Fox.

ICE Director Todd Lyons earlier confirmed to CNN that the shooter is “down”.

There was a shooting this morning at the Dallas @ICEgov Detention Facility. Details are still emerging but we can confirm there were multiple injuries and fatalities. The shooter is deceased by a self-inflicted gun shot wound. While we don't know motive yet, we know that our…

At least two detainees were injured in the shooting, officials told CNN.

Todd Lyons, the ICE director, earlier told the network that three people were shot in total and taken to hospital.

Reports suggest at least three people were hit in the attack.

Highway camera footage shows dozens of police cars responding to the scene.

The video shows almost 30 vehicles with flashing lights parked off Dallas's I-35E highway after multiple were shot at a nearby ICE facility.

The footage, obtained by CNN, was captured around 8.20am ET.

Multiple people have reportedly been shot by a “possible sniper” at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Top GOP and White House allies working behind the scenes to prevent Epstein vote on House floor","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/24/politics/epstein-files-house-gop-block","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 23:47:07 GMT","


            Top congressional Republicans and White House allies are working behind the scenes to prevent a politically charged floor vote to release the government's Jeffrey Epstein case files next month, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions.
    


            The intensifying effort to halt that floor vote comes as Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, declared on Wednesday they have the 218 votes needed to compel one when Congress returns. That final signature on their petition to force the vote will come from Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, who won a special election in Arizona Tuesday night, once she is formally sworn in.
    


            Discharge petitions historically have a bad track record of actually forcing a vote, mostly because lawmakers in the majority are wary of taking a stand against leadership. The Epstein issue, however, has animated some Republican members, with Trump allies on Capitol Hill like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina signing onto the petition.
    


            While the exact strategy to avoid a vote is not yet clear, some of the GOP lawmakers who have signed on are privately being pressured to withdraw their name from the petition, which would prevent a vote from taking place, one of those sources said.
    


            Boebert told CNN last week that she would not be removing her name from the petition, noting at the time that she was not getting pressured to do so.
    


            GOP leaders are now working to prevent the vote from happening, one of the sources said, because Massie and Khanna are just days away from collecting the 218 signatures needed to force leadership's hand. The pair had notched their 217th signature earlier this month when Democratic Rep. James Walkinshaw, fresh off winning a special election in Virginia's 11th District, was sworn in and signed the petition.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson has argued that Massie's petition has been drafted in a way that does not adequately protect victims' personal information and has said the full House has no need to take a vote while the Oversight Committee's investigation is ongoing.
    


            The last time Johnson was confronted with a discharge petition, he reached a compromise with Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, the GOP lawmaker pushing the bill, and she agreed not to force the vote. Johnson had previously tried to kill Luna's petition by inserting language – through the House Rules Committee – into an unrelated rule vote. That effort, however, failed on the floor.
    


            Republicans on the House Rules Committee have made clear that this time, they will not help Johnson kill the Epstein files vote, a third source said.
    


            While few Republicans have backed the effort to force a vote, a number have expressed support for the underlying bill. Still, it would face an uphill battle in the Senate if it cleared the House.

            The first new episode of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” since his suspension averaged 6.3 million viewers via traditional television, more than three times the show's typical TV viewership, even though the show was blacked out in dozens of markets.
    


            In the key advertiser-friendly demographic of viewers ages 18 to 49, the show scored its “highest regularly scheduled episode in over 10 years,” ABC said Wednesday afternoon.
    


            And on YouTube, Kimmel has been gaining more than a million views per hour. Combining ABC, YouTube and social media platforms, Kimmel's monologue about free speech in America has reached tens of millions of people, and the view counts are still rising.
    


            The preliminary Nielsen ratings, which will grow later once on-demand viewership is calculated, are all the more notable because the Kimmel telecast was not shown on scores of local ABC-affiliated stations.
    


Missed Kimmel's return? Here's a transcript of his monologue



            Two major TV station groups, Nexstar and Sinclair, are continuing to preempt the talk show, and those groups have ABC-affiliated stations that reach roughly 23%  of American TV households.
    


            Curious viewers in those markets likely turned to YouTube and other streaming platforms to see Kimmel's nearly 30-minute-long monologue.
    


            The monologue video has been viewed more than 15 million times on YouTube so far, making it Kimmel's most-viewed monologue of all time on the platform.
    


            Previously, Kimmel's most-watched YouTube video was the monologue when he tearfully revealed his son Billy's heart disease eight years ago.

The European football governing body UEFA will not suspend Israeli national teams and clubs over the conflict in Gaza after encountering significant pushback from the US, the newspaper Israel Hayom reported on Tuesday.  

The potential suspension of Israel is not on UEFA's agenda thanks to the efforts of unspecified “Israeli and international diplomats, football association leaders, and sports officials,” as well as “American officials” who pressed the organization “not to upset the status quo,” according to the newspaper. The US is not a member of UEFA.  

The report comes after a UN panel on Monday urged UEFA and global governing body FIFA to suspend Israel. The move is a “necessary response to address the ongoing genocide in the occupied Palestinian territory,” the experts said as the war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas is approaching the two-year mark. 

“Sports must reject the perception that it is business as usual. Sporting bodies must not turn a blind eye to grave human rights violations, especially when their platforms are used to normalize injustices,” the experts said, adding that “a growing number of international bodies [are] affirming that genocide is being committed.”

The effort to suspend Israel was reportedly spearheaded by Qatar. While the Gulf country has long advocated such a move, it renewed its effort in the wake of the September 9 Israeli attack on a Hamas compound in Doha.

UEFA has long been accused of double standards due to suspending Russia within a week after the Ukraine conflict escalated in February 2022 while showing little response to the Gaza crisis. Asked for comment on the latest developments, legendary Russian footballer and coach Andrey Kanchelskis urged the European body to lift the ban imposed on the country. 

“These are double standards. They exist, unfortunately. We are hostages to the situation. Let Russia be brought back into international tournaments,” Kanchelskis told the newspaper Sport Express.

A joint statement by Ukraine and the EU condemning Russia has received the backing of only 36 out of the 193 UN member states. The US notably abstained.

Presented by EU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrey Sibiga at the UN Headquarters in New York on Tuesday, the document describes Russia's actions vis-a-vis Ukraine as a “blatant violation of the UN Charter.” It also calls on the global community to “maximize pressure” on Moscow, and to support Ukraine's “territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.”

The joint statement was endorsed by the 26 EU member states, with the exception of Hungary, and also endorsed by Albania, Andorra, Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Japan, Monaco, New Zealand, Norway, and the UK.

Back in February, the UN Security Council rejected a resolution drafted by Kiev and its European backers that contained similar anti-Russian rhetoric. A competing resolution promoted by the US was eventually adopted, with Washington, Moscow, and eight other members voting in favor and five European nations abstaining. That version avoided branding Russia as an aggressor and called for a “swift end” to the Ukraine conflict.

Moscow's deputy envoy to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, at the time described the outcome as a victory for common sense, claiming that “more and more people realize the true colors of the Zelensky regime.”

Moscow has consistently characterized the Ukraine conflict as a proxy war being waged against it by the West.

The Kremlin has repeatedly stated that the hostilities would end were Kiev to renounce its claims to the five regions that have joined Russia through referendums since 2014, reaffirm its neutral status, and guarantee the rights of the Russian-speaking population on its territory.

Democrats say Trump allies are using incident for ‘political points' against the left despite the victims being detainees

A deadly shooting at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) field office in Dallas has been met with markedly different reactions from the political right and left.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed shortly after the news broke that detainees were the victims of the sniper attack on the facility and that no federal agents had been injured. The president and his allies, however, were quick to frame the shooting as an attack on Ice and place blame on the “radical left”.

The department previously said two detainees were killed, but later issued a clarifying statement saying the shooting killed one detainee. It said two other detainees were shot and are in critical condition.

Official statements have lacked focus on the victims having been detainees, and at a press conference officials said the identities of the victims would not be released at this time. Figures on the left have centered on the victims' families, pushed for greater gun control and urged a rejection of anti-immigrant sentiment.

Donald Trump rushed to politicize the incident, blaming the violence squarely on “Radical Left Terrorists” and the Democratic party. “This violence is the result of the Radical Left Democrats constantly demonizing Law Enforcement, calling for ICE to be demolished, and comparing ICE Officers to “Nazis,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform.

JD Vance called the shooting an “obsessive attack on law enforcement” that “must stop”. The vice-president claimed it was carried out by “a violent left-wing extremist” who was “politically motivated to go after law enforcement”.

Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem also said: “This shooting must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about Ice has consequences. Comparing Ice Day-in and day-out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences.”

The FBI said authorities recovered shell casings with “anti-Ice messaging” near the shooter, but officials said the investigation was continuing and have neither confirmed the motive behind the attack, nor corroborated claims about the shooter's ideological background.

The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence. The DHS said the shooter “fired indiscriminately” at the Ice facility, “including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot”. The attacker died from a self-inflicted gun wound.

Greg Abbott, the Republican Texas governor and staunch Trump ally, called the attack an “assassination” and said that “Texas supports Ice”. He wrote on X: “This assassination will NOT slow our arrest, detention, & deportation of illegal immigrants. We will work with ICE & the Dallas Police Dept. to get to the bottom of the assassin's motive.”

Texas senator Ted Cruz also invoked the killing of rightwing commentator Charlie Kirk as he told reporters that political violence “must stop” and rebuked politicians who have been critical of Ice. “Your political opponents are not Nazis,” Cruz raged at Democrats, who he accused of “demonizing” Ice. “This has very real consequences,” he said.

Later, after a reporter brought up reports that the victims were detainees, Cruz acknowledged that the motive of the shooter was not known.

The attack comes amid fears the Trump administration plans a crackdown on leftwing organizations and amid the censorship of critical or nuanced commentary in the aftermath of Kirk's killing, targeting people from visa holders to late-night talkshow host Jimmy Kimmel.

Marc Veasey, a Democratic representative for Texas who represents the area where the shooting took place, told the Notus website that political “gamesmanship” was spiraling out of control, and said he was “sickened” by officials' focus on law enforcement and lack of acknowledgement that the victims were detainees.

He added that he lacked trust in the FBI, which had become “overly political” under Trump, and said smears against Democrats were not helpful, citing that the GOP also routinely call colleagues on the left “Marxists”.

“We have to start condemning this rhetoric from both sides,” Veasey said. “I was hoping that after the assassination of Charlie Kirk that we would have learned lessons and that we realize that this is not about gamesmanship. This is not about one-upsmanship … This is about public safety.”

Former Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who leads the gun violence prevention group Giffords, said her heart broke for the victims' families and urged leaders to take action against the “gun crime crisis” gripping the country.

Congresswoman Summer Lee of Pennsylvania, wrote on X: “Leave it to this administration to use a shooting against immigrant detainees to score political points and further provoke violence. We have to get guns off our streets and reject xenophobic and anti-immigrant sentiment that makes all of us less safe.”

Pennsylvania state representative Malcolm Kenyatta said: “Kristi Noem couldn't get to Twitter fast enough to use the Dallas Ice shooting for political points. But local news now says it was detainees who were shot – not Ice agents.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

One detainee was killed and two were critically wounded in shooting the White House says is ‘politically motivated'

Texas Ice facility shooting – latest updates

Texas Ice facility shooting: Republicans blame ‘radical left' as Democrats focus on victims and gun control

A gunman fired at a Dallas immigration field office on Wednesday, killing one detainee and critically wounding two more, before killing himself in what authorities called an indiscriminate attack on US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).

Here's what we know about the attack so far:

One detainee has been killed, with two others in critical condition. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said previously that two detainees had been killed and one injured, but issued a corrected statement. The Dallas police chief, Daniel Comeaux, said that the FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence. The shooter died from a “self-inflicted gun wound”, according to the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem.

The DHS said no members of law enforcement were hurt in the attack. But Comeaux also said that officials would not be releasing the identities of any victims at this time.

DHS officials say this was “an attack on Ice law enforcement”. At both today's press conference and in a statement, law enforcement said that shell casings found near the shooter had “anti-Ice” messaging on them.

The shooter has been identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, according to NBC News – which cited several senior law enforcement officials.

Dallas police said that shots were fired “from an adjacent building”. The DHS later added that the shooter “fired indiscriminately” at the Ice facility, “including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot”. All three victims were inside the van at the time the gunman opened fire.

The Dallas field office where the shooting occurred is used for short-term processing of people in custody. The victims may have been recently arrested by Ice. The facility is along Interstate 35 East, south-west of a large commercial airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and just blocks from hotels catering to airport travelers.

Despite the fact that no federal agents were wounded in the shooting, the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, called the attack an “assassination”. For her part, Noem said that “these horrendous killings must serve as a wake-up call to the far left that their rhetoric about Ice has consequences”.

Donald Trump instantly politicized the shooting, claiming in a social media post that it “is the result of the Radical Left Democrats constantly demonizing Law Enforcement, calling for ICE to be demolished, and comparing ICE Officers to ‘Nazis.'”

The vice-president, JD Vance, claimed without evidence that the shooting was carried out by “a violent leftwing extremist” who was “politically motivated to go after law enforcement”. While the FBI has said that authorities recovered shell casings with “anti-Ice messaging” near the shooter, officials have neither confirmed a motive nor corroborated Vance's claims about the shooter's ideological background.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Former president says successor's claims about drug branded Tylenol in US ‘undermines public health that can do harm to women'

Barack Obama has said Donald Trump's claims linking paracetamol to autism in infants is “violence against the truth” that could harm pregnant women if they were too scared to take pain relief.

Obama, who was being interviewed by David Olusoga at the O2 Arena, told the audience that Trump's claims about paracetamol – branded as Tylenol in the US – had been “continuously disproved” and posed a danger to public health.

“We have the spectacle of my successor in the Oval Office making broad claims around certain drugs and autism that have been continuously disproved,” he said. “It undermines public health … that can do harm to women.”

On Monday Trump had said: “Taking Tylenol is not good … All pregnant women should talk to their doctors about limiting the use of this medication while pregnant.”

The comments were criticised by the UK health secretary, Wes Streeting, who encouraged women to ignore the president's comments.

Obama argued there was a “tug of war” between two visions for the future of the US and humanity. On one side the progressive view where change came through democracy, the other driven by populists including Trump wanting a return to an older, more conservative worldview.

He said: “My successor has not been particularly shy about it. That desire is to go back to a very particular way of thinking about America, where ‘we, the people', is just some people, not all people. And where there are some pretty clear hierarchies in terms of status and who ranks where.”

Obama was also critical of progressives who he said became “complacent” and “smug” in the 90s and 00s, “posturing that we believe in all these values because they were never tested. Now they're being tested”.

The former president has generally kept a low profile after leaving office. But he has made increasingly frequent interventions as the political landscape in the US becomes more violent, restive and divided along partisan lines.

In London, Obama did not refer to Trump by name, only as “my successor”.

The evening started with Olusoga welcoming the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, who had been criticised by Trump on Tuesday during his speech at the UN in New York. Khan had responded by saying Trump had “shown he is racist, he is sexist, he is misogynistic and he's Islamophobic”.

Obama is in London as part of a European speaking tour, which includes another date in Dublin on Friday. He is due to receive the Freedom of Dublin on Thursday.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍) yesterday expressed his sincere thanks to US Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy for calling for Taiwan's inclusion in the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) technical work regardless of politics.

The ministry relayed Lin's thanks in a statement issued after Duffy's remarks on the first day of the ICAO's triennial general assembly in Montreal on Tuesday.

Duffy said that for the sake of global safety, countries that threaten aviation security should be excluded from the ICAO leadership, while all stakeholders, including Taiwan, must be included in its technical work regardless of politics.

“There is no room for politics on this question — this is about safety and security of the global system we all enjoy, and of which Taiwan plays an active part,” he said.

Civil Aviation Administration of China Deputy Administrator Liang Nan (梁楠) hit back against Duffy's comments on Taiwan, saying “there is only one China in the world.”

Last month, US lawmakers urged the ICAO to oppose China's decision to unilaterally extend a flight route in the Taiwan Strait.

In Taipei, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it sternly condemns Liang's distortion of UN Resolution 2758 and Beijing's “one China principle,” intended to use political manipulation to block Taiwan's participation in international organizations and multilateral mechanisms.

The ministry reiterated that the Republic of China is an independent sovereign country, and it and the People's Republic of China (PRC) are not subordinate to each other — which is the “status quo” of the Taiwan Strait that is recognized by the international community.

UN Resolution 2758 does not mention Taiwan, nor state that Taiwan is a part of the PRC, and it did not give China the right to represent Taiwan in the UN, the ministry said.

Only Taiwan's democratically elected government can represent Taiwan in the ICAO, the UN system and other international bodies, it said.

The Civil Aviation Administration is the only authority that maintains the safety of the Taipei Flight Information Region, providing traffic control services for more than 1 million flights per year, so including Taiwan in the ICAO can ensure the integrity and safety of the global civil aviation system, the ministry said.

It urged the ICAO to firmly reject China's political pressure, and invite Taiwan to its meetings, mechanism and events.

At Tuesday's meeting, Duffy also criticized the UN aviation group for not focusing enough on safety and security.

“Over the years, this body has extended itself far beyond its proper mandate — wasting critical resources on social programs or climate financing initiatives that have nothing to do with the safety, security and efficiency of the global air transportation system,” he said.

“Our ability to achieve this reform will factor into how [US] President [Donald] Trump and the United States evaluate support for ICAO moving forward,” Duffy said.

European Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas told the assembly that environmental targets, such as achieving net zero emissions by 2050, are in line with its goals on safety and security.

“None of these elements can be viewed in isolation,” he said.

The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) on Tuesday condemned “threats of terrorism” after receiving an e-mail threatening violence over the National Palace Museum's exhibition in Prague.

The message demanded that Taiwan shutter the exhibition or risk acts of “arson, theft, shooting or terrorism” at the Czech Republic's National Museum, which is hosting the event, the council said in a statement.

Taiwan “solemnly condemns threats of terrorism and calls for a stop to violence, threats and other irrational behavior,” the council said.

The Mainland Affairs Council is working with Taiwan's representative office in the Czech Republic, the National Museum in Prague and local law enforcement to enhance security, it said.

Citing unnamed sources, the Central News Agency said the person or group behind the threat had used the same account to send threatening messages to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Culture.

The “100 Treasures, 100 Stories” exhibition to mark the National Palace Museum's centennial is the museum's first overseas exhibition and part of Taiwan's cultural diplomatic outreach.

In response, museum director Hsiao Tsung-huang (蕭宗煌) convened an emergency meeting over the threat with the museum's departments responsible for the artifacts on display in Prague, it said in a statement.

The museum is collaborating with Taiwanese law enforcement to bolster security for the campuses, exhibition spaces and informational systems of its northern branch in Taipei and southern branch in Chiayi County's Taibao City (太保), it said.

Security officers are on alert for suspicious activity and have been instructed to promptly report potential threats, it said, adding that regular communications is being maintained with the National Museum in Prague.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that it is engaged in efforts to secure the exhibition in the Czech Republic and that it has recommended that the MAC turn over the threatening e-mail to police.

A former RBC employee allegedly accessed Prime Minister Mark Carney's banking profile in June.Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press

A former Royal Bank of Canada RY-T employee is facing criminal charges after allegedly accessing Prime Minister Mark Carney's banking profile and participating in a fraud scheme believed to be linked to organized crime.

Ibrahim El-Hakim, who was then a client adviser, allegedly accessed Mr. Carney's profile on June 17 at an RBC branch near Parliament Hill.

The 23-year-old Ottawa resident has been charged with fraud over $5,000, unauthorized use of a computer, identity theft and trafficking in identity information, according to court documents.

The allegations have not been proven in court.

Cheryl Brean, a spokesperson for RBC, said the bank worked closely with law enforcement to support their investigation.

“While we cannot comment on specifics of matters before the court, we can share that we independently identified unauthorized system access, took immediate action to engage authorities and the individual named is no longer employed at the bank,” Ms. Brean said in a statement.

According to an affidavit from an RCMP officer, RBC's director of security interviewed Mr. El-Hakim on June 27 as part of the bank's internal investigation.

During the interview, Mr. El-Hakim, who was hired in 2022, admitted to participating in fraud, according to the court document. He said he had been lured into the scheme by someone on the Telegram app using the alias “AI WORLD,” which is believed to be a group linked to organized crime, the affidavit said.

The Telegram user asked him to create banking profiles, obtain credit cards and access customer profiles, paying him $500 for each completed request, according to the affidavit. Mr. El-Hakim received a total of $5,000 in payment to his accounts at Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the document said.

According to RBC's internal investigation, the total credit-card fraud amounts to $68,500. The majority of the alleged fraud occurred in June and was captured on camera, although some occurred earlier, according to the affidavit.

Mr. El-Hakim also allegedly accessed a banking profile belonging to a Justin Trudeau, according to the affidavit, although the CBC reported that the RCMP later confirmed the account did not belong to the former prime minister.

The RCMP officer's affidavit was filed in Montreal as part of a request to preserve security footage held by Tyco Integrated Security.

Mr. El-Hakim could not be reached for comment. His lawyer, Ronald Guertin, declined to comment, noting that he has not yet received all of the police information regarding the allegations.

A spokesperson for the Prime Minister's Office also declined to comment, noting that the matter is in the hands of the RCMP.

According to the affidavit, the RCMP's Eastern Region Integrated National Security Enforcement Team began investigating the matter in early July.

Integrated National Security Enforcement Teams, or INSETs, are multiagency teams led by the RCMP that work to combat the activities of terrorist groups and individuals who threaten Canada's national security.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz has addressed the Bundestag in a debate on Germany's 2026 budget. The far-right Alternative for Germany opened the proceedings by lambasting Merz's government over debt. Follow DW for more.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz has spoken in Germany's lower house, the Bundestag, during a debate on the 2026 federal budget.

Other parliamentary leaders are also set to speak before lawmakers tackle foreign, defense, and development budgets later in the day.

Green Party lawmakers have criticized Merz for skipping the United Nations General Assembly in New York, where Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is representing Germany.

Stay tuned for the latest news and analysis on this and a range of issues connected with Germany from Wednesday, September 24:

German swimmer Marius Kusch is the first German athlete to confirm his participation in the Enhanced Games, a tournament where athletes will compete with the aid of performance-enhancing drugs. 

""The truth is the sport never gave me the financial stability to build a future,"" Kusch said on Wednesday. ""Now I want to take care of my family...The Enhanced Games is an opportunity to do that,"" he added.

""I know this decision will spark debate, but I believe sports evolve by asking hard questions and challenging the status quo,"" the professional swimmer said.

The Enhanced Games will debut in May of 2026 in Las Vegas and along with swimming, it will also feature athletics and weightlifting. No doping tests will be carried out, which means competitors can have free rein to take performance-enhancing drugs. 

Kusch's participation will come with a price, as the World Aquatics organization rejected the event, saying it will ban any swimmer competing in it.

The chairman of the German Swimming Federation (DSV), Jan Pommer, strongly criticized Kusch's move, saying The Enhanced Games ""are diametrically opposed to everything sport stands for.""

Enhanced Games organizers said the tournament will pay appearance fees and each individual event will carry a prize fund of $500,000 (€426,000), with $250,000 awarded to the winner. Addtionally, prize money will be awarded to those who break world records.

A new survey shows 44% of German voters support recognizing a Palestinian state, up from 41% in May 2025 and 40% in June 2024. Twenty-three percent oppose recognition, while 33% remain undecided, according to the YouGov poll. 

Support is highest among Greens voters at 61%, followed by the socialist Left Party at 58% and the center-left Social Democrats at 53%. Among supporters of the conservative CDU/CSU bloc, 40% favor recognition of an independent Palestinian state.

Far-right Alternative for Germany voters are the only group where opposition, at 37%, exceeds support, which stands at 32%.

The share of respondents unsure about the issue has dropped from 39% in May to the current 33%, matching the level seen in June 2024.

France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta and Andorra declared that they were recognizing the State of Palestine at the UN General Assembly in New York on Monday. The day before, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Portugal recognized Palestine.

The German government has said it will not be taking the step ""in the short term.""

Another group of 28 Afghans who successfully sued for entry to Germany is expected to arrive in Hanover on Wednesday afternoon, the aid organization Kabul Luftbrücke said.

The group of Afghans includes five men, 10 women and 13 children who had been promised resettlement under Germany's federal admission program for people at particular risk but had to secure visas through the courts. 

After the change of government in Berlin, the new centrist coalition sharply restricted such admissions despite earlier commitments. Courts have since upheld the rights of some individuals with confirmed approvals.

A separate group of 47 Afghans arrived in early September. The Foreign Office estimates about 2,300 more Afghans with admission pledges are still waiting to leave — mostly in Pakistan, with the rest in Afghanistan — after receiving assurances following the Taliban takeover in August 2021.

Berlin's main airport has said passengers should expect major disruptions for several days after a cyberattack hit an IT service provider that processes the check-in and baggage systems.

It is expected that several more days will be needed to restore secure software. With many check-ins and boardings still handled manually, travelers face long waits, delays and flight cancellations.

The outage stems from a cyberattack on US aviation supplier Collins Aerospace, a subsidiary of defense and technology group RTX. Its systems are used by airlines and airports worldwide, and the attack has caused check-in and baggage failures at other airports, including London's Heathrow Airport. 

Costa Rican investigators say a German couple has been found dead near their property on the Pacific coast, with robbery believed to be the motive.

The bodies of a man and a woman were discovered buried near the couple's Finca Cerros estate in Quepos, the Judicial Investigation Department said. The pair had been reported missing a day earlier.

According to Germany's Bild newspaper, citing local media, the couple had lived in Costa Rica for about two years and purchased the farm during that time. Neighbors last saw them on Saturday.

US comedian Jimmy Kimmel made a joking reference to Germany as he returned to ABC's late-night lineup Tuesday after a brief suspension over comments about conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing.

Starting his show to loud applause, Kimmel thanked supporters ""from Ireland and from Germany,"" and quipped: ""The guy in Germany offered me a job. Can you imagine this country has become so authoritarian, the Germans are like, 'come here'?""

The remark appeared to nod to German comedian Stefan Raab, who invited Kimmel to take over his RTL show, calling himself a fan of ""uncensored entertainment.""

While ABC reinstated Kimmel, some local affiliates, including those owned by the Nexstar media group, said they would keep his show off their schedules for now.

Business confidence in Germany has weakened in September after months of improvement, with companies less satisfied with current conditions and more cautious about the outlook, according to the Munich-based Ifo Institute.

The Ifo business climate index dropped to 87.7 from 88.9 in August, dampening hopes for an economic recovery. Sentiment in the services sector fell sharply, with expectations hitting their lowest level since February and current assessments also declining, especially in transport and logistics.

Manufacturing firms rated both their present situation and future prospects slightly worse, and new orders declined. Retailers grew more pessimistic despite a slightly better view of current conditions, while construction confidence rose after a previous dip.

KfW bank chief economist Dirk Schumacher called the drop a ""clear disappointment."" 

Meanwhile, the ING bank analyst Carsten Brzeski said optimism faded not only because of new US tariffs and a strong euro but also due to domestic policy concerns, warning that few structural reforms may follow the planned fiscal stimulus.

Germans saw a first on Wednesday when Green Party lawmaker Hanna Steinmüller delivered a speech at the Bundestag's plenary podium while carrying her baby.

The 32-year-old Berlin-Mitte representative spoke about the budget for the Ministry of Housing, Urban Development and Building with her child asleep in a front carrier. Steinmüller, who announced the birth in December, had previously brought the baby to the chamber but not to the lectern.

""Wild day. We'll enjoy the evening first and share thoughts on balancing family and work tomorrow,"" she wrote later on Instagram.

Parliament President Julia Klöckner praised the moment, saying Steinmüller handled the appearance ""brilliantly"" and added that allowing infants in the chamber can be appropriate under certain circumstances.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz has called for deep reforms to counter Germany's economic slowdown and global instability, telling the Bundestag on Wednesday that the country faces one of the most challenging periods in its modern history.

""The entire Western community of values is facing perhaps its greatest test,"" the conservative Christian Democrat leader said during the debate on the 2026 federal budget, warning that Germany's export-driven economy depends on an open, rules-based world order.

""Only a growth-oriented economy generates the resources we need to fund infrastructure, show solidarity and ensure lasting social security,"" Merz said, adding that unions and employers alike are deeply worried about jobs and investment. ""That is why we must act, and act quickly.""

Merz skipped the UN General Assembly in New York to attend the budget session, which follows last week's debate on the 2025 spending plan.

The co-chair of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), Tino Chrupalla, has accused the German government of pursuing a ""debt binge,"" citing planned new borrowing of about €174 billion (roughly $204.8 billion) next year.

""You are recklessly wasting the capital of future generations,"" Chrupalla said as he opened the Bundestag's general debate on the chancellery's budget, the first time he has led the opposition response in this session.

Chrupalla criticized high energy prices, the tax and levy burden, and spending on climate protection and the citizens' benefit programs, as well as arguing that migration costs primarily strain the social welfare system.

His co-chair, Alice Weidel, led the opposition remarks during last week's debate on the current-year budget.

While other world leaders address the United Nations General Assembly, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is speaking as part of the Bundestag's deliberations on Germany's 2026 federal budget.

Leaders of the other parliamentary groups also plan to take the floor as part of the general debate, which is traditionally used for a broad confrontation over the federal government's policies as a whole.

Later in the day, the individual budgets for the foreign, defense and development ministries are scheduled.

The budget debate began on Tuesday with the presentation of the draft by Federal Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil from the center-left Social Democrats.

Another general debate in the Bundestag took place only last week. The focus then was still on the 2025 federal budget, which had been delayed because of Germany's February election.

The Green Party on Tuesday criticized Merz for staying in Germany as the General Assembly opens in New York, where about 150 world leaders are gathering this week.

Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is representing Berlin as Merz instead focuses on the federal budget week and a key constitutional court election in the Bundestag.

Nearly 15 years after his on-air accident, Germany's Federal Social Court is set to decide whether actor Samuel Koch qualifies for a statutory accident pension.

Koch, then 23, was paralyzed during the December 2010 live broadcast of ""Wetten, dass..?"" when he attempted to leap over five moving cars on spring stilts and struck the fourth vehicle, driven by his father.

The show's format was the basis for the British show ""You Bet!"" and the American show ""Wanna Bet?""

Now 37, Koch applied in 2020 for an accident pension, arguing he was volunteering for a public broadcaster. A lower court rejected the claim, finding that he organized the stunt himself for personal publicity rather than as part of a public-service role.

A Christian summer camp where 27 children died in a flash flood will reopen, to the outrage of the victims' families.

The owners of Camp Mystic in Texas announced reconstruction plans on Monday in a series of emails that were sent to the victims' families and former campers.

Camp Mystic's bosses looked forward to “rebuilding cabins and trails” that were swept away by the floods, the emails said, according to the New York Times.

“We are not only rebuilding cabins and trails, but also a place where laughter, friendship and spiritual growth will continue to flourish,” an email to past campers read.

“We look forward to welcoming you back inside the green gates.”

The new facility will open at the camp's second site close to the Guadalupe River, which burst its banks on July 4, killing a total of 135 people at the girls-only summer camp in Kerrville.

The river is a well-studied, high-risk flood zone, according to mapped data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema).

The disaster was one of the most lethal floods in US history, with a death toll of at least 120 people — including 36 children. Three people are still missing.

Authorities faced questions about a series of apparent safety failings in the aftermath of the flood, including the location of some of the cabins and an insufficient flood warning system.

The rebuilt cabins will not be in the same location, it is understood.

The camp's reopening has been met with fury from victims' families, especially as one child, Cile Steward, eight, remains missing.

Her mother, Cici, released a statement on Tuesday condemning plans to reopen the camp. She said: “The truth is, Camp Mystic failed our daughters.

“Recovery teams are still out there, scouring the river, risking and sacrificing so much to find her so we can finally lay her to rest.

“For their efforts, we are eternally grateful. Camp Mystic, however, has only added to our grief,” she wrote.

She accused the camp of engaging in a “brief pause before business as usual”.

She added: “Camp Mystic is pressing ahead with reopening, even if it means inviting girls to swim in the same river that may potentially still hold my daughter's body.”

Camp Mystic also plans to build a memorial on the camp dedicated to those who were killed in the floods earlier this summer.

Blake Bonner, the father of Lila, nine, who died in the flood, said the families who lost loved ones in July were “not consulted and did not approve this memorial”.

The emails that were sent out on Monday were signed by members of the Eastland family, who have owned the camp for nearly a century.

Richard “Dick” Eastland, who was the camp's director at the time of the flooding, died trying to save girls from the flooding.

He was accused of failing to evacuate campers until an hour after the first official alert warning of oncoming catastrophic Texas floods.

According to the Washington Post, he had notified some staff about the flood alert, which did not have an evacuation notice, and told them to “monitor the situation”.

A statement released by the Eastland family on Tuesday said they had received “no negative comments from any of the bereaved families regarding plans to build a memorial.”

But Mr Bonner believes the camp's resources should remain focused on finding Cile's body.

The search for her body has become a rallying point for the families of the deceased, forming what they call “Heaven's 27”.

The group is calling for legislation in Texas to implement camp safety reforms, including by building new cabins and moving existing ones away from floodplains.

A push to repeal the Roadless Rule that protects the few ecosystems that remain truly wild faces mass public opposition.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

A Trump administration proposal to rescind a bedrock conservation rule that protects 45 million acres of pristine national forests and the nation's least-developed public lands from logging, road construction, development, and pollution is facing widespread opposition. Despite federal regulators providing an unusually brief time window for public comment, hundreds of thousands of comments were filed, with one analysis showing a near-unanimous desire to keep the rule in place.

The Roadless Area Conservation Rule, also known as the Roadless Rule, prohibits road construction and timber harvests in many of the remaining wilderness areas that standard cars and trucks cannot reach, effectively preventing mining, hydrocarbon extraction, and logging in those areas and limiting the human footprint in pristine ecosystems. Conservation groups say the rule is critical for preserving sources of clean drinking water, wildlife migration corridors, and access to large areas of unfragmented backcountry cherished by outdoors enthusiasts.

“Roadless Areas are not just scenic backcountry — they are biodiversity strongholds and fire-adapted ecosystems that rely on natural, mixed-severity fire to thrive,” said Jennifer Mamola, advocacy and policy director at the John Muir Project, a forest science think tank, in an email.

The potential repeal of the Roadless Rule would add to a long list of environmental protections slashed under President Donald Trump. In March,​​ Trump ordered the Forest Service and other agencies to bypass the Endangered Species Act and promote an “immediate expansion” of timber production on federal lands as part of a broader push to empower favored industries. The Trump administration argues the Roadless Rule is a needless regulation that frustrates local land managers, stifles “jobs and economic growth” in rural communities, and limits access for wildfire prevention efforts such as fuel management — which Trump has called “cleaning the floors” — a claim Mamola said contradicts studies linking roadbuilding to an increase in human-caused fires.

“Weakening protections puts both wildlife and the integrity of these landscapes at risk, while doing nothing to make our communities safer,” Mamola said.

Big timber and paper companies that would profit from greater access to old-growth forests in Alaska and the Western U.S. tend to support more Republican than Democratic candidates and spend millions of dollars a year lobbying Congress, according to OpenSecrets. Trump was the industry's top recipient of campaign cash in 2024, followed by Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Arkansas).

The rule was enacted in 2001 after the Forest Service collaborated with multiple federal agencies to hold hundreds of public hearings as well as consultations with Native American tribes across the Western United States over a two-year period. At the time, 1.6 million public comments poured in, with more than 90 percent supporting the protections for wilderness, according to the Center for Western Priorities.

This history of public input stands in stark contrast to the process today under Trump to repeal the rule. On August 27, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins announced a 21-day window for the public to comment on the administration's proposal for rescinding the Roadless Rule. Public comment periods are typically at least 30 days and can run up to 90 or 120 days for complex federal regulations with broad impact.

Despite the truncated public comment period, the proposal to rescind the rule received 625,737comments by September 19, which includes some 400,000 petitions opposing the proposal that were delivered in bulk by conservation groups in the final hours of the comment period. An analysis of 183,000 comments filed before the bulk petitions arrived from the Center for Western Priorities found that more than 99 percent opposed the rescission of the rule. Less than 1 percent of comments supported rescinding the rule, including a comment from the Republican Party of New Mexico, which argues the rule frustrates local land managers.

Rep. Jared Huffman is the ranking member on the House Natural Resources Committee and a Democrat from a densely forested district in northern California, where the Six Rivers National Forest alone supplies $428 million worth of clean drinking water to homes each year. In a letter to Rollins on September 19, Huffman said the Roadless Rule also protects clean water sources and recreational access to the Mendocino National Forest and the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in his district, and urged the secretary to extend the public comment period by 45 days and by 120 days for tribal consultation.

“Repealing the Rule would be a profound mistake, locking in a future of increasingly severe wildfires, fiscal irresponsibility, and water scarcity. I urge you to abandon this reckless course and uphold the Roadless Rule's protections,” Huffman said in a statement.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's press office did not respond to Truthout's requests for comment by the time this story was published.

Supporters of rescinding the Roadless Rule argue it creates barriers to active forest management and efforts to prevent wildfires that are intensifying with climate change, such as clearing potential fuel for fire. However, like Mamola, Huffman says this is misleading. The Roadless Rule does allow for fuel management and timber harvests under certain circumstances, according to Huffman, and dozens of conservation groups agree that punching more holes into the backcountry with roads would lead to more human-caused fires, as research has shown.

“Peer-reviewed science shows that logging in backcountry landscapes does not protect communities and often increases fire risk, especially near roads, where 95 percent of human-caused fires occur,” Mamola said. “By contrast, investments in home hardening and defensible space deliver a three to four times return in disaster recovery, according to FEMA's 2018 report.”

Last month, 155 public lands groups, including the John Muir Project, sent a letter to Congress calling for stronger protections for designated roadless areas, specifically highlighting loopholes that allow logging and road-building under the guise of wildfire mitigation.

“Now, as the push to repeal the Roadless Rule gains momentum, closing these loopholes and protecting these wildlands is more urgent than ever,” Mamola said. 

Instead of rescinding the Roadless Rule, the groups urge Congress to protect the entire 58.2 million-acre roadless area as initially surveyed and regulated under the Clinton administration, and to add new protections such as prohibitions on commercial cattle grazing and motorized vehicles. The Trump administration says its proposal to rescind the rule would impact 45 million acres of the nearly 60 million currently without roads.

Conservationists say roadless areas are also buffer zones that protect national parks and wildlife sanctuaries visited by hikers and tourists from expanding wildfires. There's one reason why many backcountry areas remain roadless: they are difficult to reach, and the Forest Service already faces a $4.85 billion backlog of road maintenance across the existing 370,000 miles of forest roads, according to Huffman. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is making sweeping staffing and budget cuts and shuttering nine regional Forest Service offices nationwide.

Despite the widespread backlash amongst the public, one of the Trump administration's most needed allies in Congress has long pushed to axe the rule. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski has long supported a repeal of the Roadless Rule to further development of wild areas in her home state of Alaska. Murkowski reiterated that support of rescinding the Roadless Rule shortly after Rollins announced the proposal in June. 

According to Wes Siler, an outdoor recreation journalist writing on Substack, the Roadless Rule presents a major barrier to opening the remote Tongass National Forest in Alaska to both domestic and international logging companies. The Tongass is a vast temperate rainforest with ecosystems unlike any found elsewhere in the world. Still, Siler expects the national forest could be saved by a combination of sheer incompetence and Trump's sweeping cuts to federal agencies. Siler reports that Rollins has a paltry $50 million budget to build new Forest Service roads.

“Building roads into the Tongass was estimated to cost on average $500,000-a-mile back in 2020, when the first Trump administration tried these shenanigans for the first time,” Siler wrote on August 29. “Updated for Trumpflation, that's now $620,699. In a best case scenario, that budget only buys 80 miles of new road.”

Whether the administration will agree to extend another comment period on the Roadless Rule and commit to closer consultation with local communities and tribal governments remains to be seen. Federal law requires an environmental impact analysis of the proposal that is expected to be finalized next year and face a litany of legal challenges that could further delay any changes to the rule.

            Taylor Budowich, President Donald Trump's deputy chief of staff overseeing communications, will leave the administration later this month for a new job, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            His imminent exit makes him the highest-profile staffer to leave the White House in Trump's second term, which is now at its eight-month mark. It's not uncommon for White House staffers to cycle out after about a year. The relative stability of this administration's staff is a departure from Trump's first term, which was characterized by frequent turnover.
    


            Budowich, who declined to comment on Wednesday, served as Trump's spokesperson after he left office in 2021 and later ran the Trump-aligned super PAC MAGA Inc., before rejoining the 2024 campaign.
    


            Axios first reported his departure.
    


            Up until now, the highest-profile aide to depart had been Mike Waltz. But while he was ousted as national security adviser in May, he's since been confirmed as Trump's ambassador to the United Nations.

            The federal government is just days away from shutting down unless Congress approves a federal spending bill before October 1.
    


            Republicans and Democrats remain far apart in coming to an agreement to continue funding the federal government. One of the central issues is extending the enhanced premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage.
    


            A shutdown could disrupt the lives of many Americans, particularly federal employees, many of whom who would not be paid.
    


            Previous shutdowns have closed national parks and museums; stalled food inspections; canceled immigration hearings; and delayed some federal lending to homebuyers and small businesses, among other impacts. Though air traffic controllers have to remain on the job, many called in sick during the most recent shutdown in the first Trump administration, snarling flights.
    


            Some essential government functions continue even if agencies shut down, however. Notably, Social Security recipients will receive their monthly payments.

            The airspace over Aalborg Airport in Denmark has been closed after drones were spotted flying nearby, airport CEO Niels Hemmingsen told CNN on Wednesday, marking the second time this week that an airport in the country has been forced to close due to drone sightings.
    


            Police have not yet determined who is behind the latest incident but are investigating several theories, Denmark's National Police Commissioner Thorkild Fogde told CNN.
    


            “Once again, we have verified these objects violating the airspace over the airport as drones,” he said, noting that additional drone sightings were reported in at least three other airports Wednesday night into Thursday morning, but so far only the drones in Aalborg have been verified.
    


            Police have not ruled out taking out the drones, Fogde added, but stressed that such a scenario would be complicated.
    


            “You need to have the means to take down the drones,” he said. “You need to be able to get close enough to the flying drones, and you also have to be able to do it without jeopardizing flight safety around the airport … and you have to take public security into consideration.”
    


            Aalborg is also an active air base though it's unclear what kind of military equipment is currently present there.
    


            At least three inbound flights have been redirected to other airports, while two outbound flights and one inbound have been canceled, according to FlightRadar24.
    


Travel disruption for thousands after mystery drones closed two of Scandinavia's busiest airports



            On Monday, sightings of two or three large drones near Copenhagen airport halted all take-offs and landings for nearly four hours.
    


            It's unclear if the drones that flew near Aalborg Airport are the same as the ones in Copenhagen but Fogde said that the pattern was similar: “unauthorized drones over-flying the airport area, breaking airport security, violating the airspace.”
    


            Fogde told CNN Tuesday that the drones that flew over Copenhagen were not amateur or hobby drones, but rather large drones that likely had a capable operator. Police are still investigating that incident, he said.
    


            In Norway, the airspace over Oslo Airport was closed for around three hours Tuesday morning due to a separate drone sighting. Fogde said there was no indication the Copenhagen incident was linked to the drone sighting in Oslo.
    


            Europe has been on alert since Russian drones violated both Polish and Romanian airspace earlier this month – prompting NATO allies to pledge to beef up defenses on the bloc's eastern flank.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Residents of a San Francisco Bay Area city are on the lookout for an aggressive squirrel that has sent at least two people to the emergency room for medical treatment. 

Joan Heblack told ABC affiliate KGO-TV that she was walking in the Lucas Valley neighborhood of San Rafael when a squirrel seemingly came out of nowhere and attacked her leg, clawing and biting. 

“It clamped onto my leg. The tail was flying up here. I was like, ‘Get it off me, get off me!',” Heblack said. 

Isabel Campoy also said she was attacked while walking in the same area. The squirrel launched itself from the ground to her face and wound up on her arm, leaving it bloody, she said. 

Both women went to the emergency room, the TV station reported in its Monday story. 

Flyers have now been posted, warning residents that the squirrel is no joke and that more than five people have been attacked by a ”very mean squirrel” that “comes out of nowhere.”

Lisa Bloch with Marin Humane says they have had no reports of squirrel attacks since mid-September. If the squirrel crops up again, the nonprofit will coordinate with the state to remove the animal, she said. 

“We've seen this kind of behavior before,” she said. “It's almost always because someone has been feeding the animal.” 

The good thing is that squirrels are not vectors for rabies. She says people should never feed wildlife. 

San Rafael is in Marin County, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of San Francisco .

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announces the guilty plea of former cartel boss 'El Mayo' and touts the success of the DOJ and law enforcement.

FIRST ON FOX — Eight federal inmates — once on death row for murders, including the killings of fellow prisoners, gang-related stabbings, and the slayings of two campers — have been transferred to a notorious ""supermax"" prison in Colorado, the Justice Department told Fox News Digital. The news comes as U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi looks to crack down on the previous administration's sweeping clemency actions.

The eight former death row inmates were transferred Tuesday to the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence, Colorado, also known as ""ADX,"" Justice Department officials confirmed. 

They were among the 37 death row inmates whose sentences Biden commuted in late December — prompting criticism and complaints that the record clemency and commutation actions were done as a political ""Hail Mary,"" and without proper vetting.

More of the death row inmates are expected to be moved to ADX, some within weeks, according to one individual familiar with the matter.

The 37 death row inmates commuted by Biden are all expected to be moved to the facility by ""early next year,"" the Justice Department source told Fox News Digital.

The effort comes as Bondi and the Trump administration have sought to reverse some of the Biden administration's efforts on criminal justice reform for certain criminals, and instead moved to prioritize violent crime and cracking down on the nation's worst offenders.

Though a commutation cannot be fully reversed, Justice Department officials told Fox News Digital, Bondi has prioritized ways to penalize these individuals, in coordination with directives from Trump, and to ensure that the ""conditions of confinement"" are ""consistent with the security risks those inmates present because of their egregious crimes, criminal histories, and all other relevant considerations,"" according to an earlier DOJ memo. 

The eight inmates sent to ADX this week were each convicted of first-degree murder within federal jurisdiction. 

Many had been convicted of crimes that were especially heinous or violent. One individual was convicted of murdering a married couple who was camping at a campsite in the Ouachita National Forest in July 2003. 

Another was convicted of kidnapping, robbing, and murdering a 51-year-old local bank president by tying him to a concrete block and chain hoist, and tossing him off of a bridge and into a lake. 

Many had also killed prisoners while serving time — a factor that can be used in weighing whether to transfer a convicted felon to a higher-security prison.

ADX is the only true federal ""supermax"" prison in the U.S., and its inmates are as notorious as the prison's reputation. Among them are Ramzi Yousef, convicted in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the Boston Marathon bombers; former Sinola Cartel leader Joaquín Guzmán, or ""El Chapo""; and Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, the co-founder of al-Qaeda.

""President Biden's decision to commute the death sentences of these monsters showed abhorrent disregard for our justice system and total disrespect for victims' families already suffering through immense loss,"" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""After meeting with many of the victims' families at the Department of Justice and promising to take action on their behalf, eight of these prisoners have been transferred to the Colorado super-max prison ADX. This will ensure that they spend the remainder of their lives in conditions consistent with the egregious crimes they committed,"" she added.

Shortly after her confirmation as attorney general, Bondi issued a memo aimed at ""restoring a measure of justice"" to the victims' families. 

The measures granted by Biden earned more criticism than former President Barack Obama: As Fox News reported at the time, the vast majority of Obama's clemency actions focused on commuting the sentences of federal inmates who met certain criteria outlined under his administration's Clemency Initiative.

Bondi hosted victims' families earlier this year to hear their concerns about the commutations, DOJ said. Some said they had been stunned by the eleventh-hour commutations, and that they not been given a heads-up by the Biden administration.

In February, Bondi issued a memo to the Bureau of Prisons ordering an evaluation of where these prisoners should be detained.

Two weeks after Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk was assassinated, spokesman Andrew Kolvet revealed who had jurisdiction to monitor the rooftop where the alleged killer fired the fatal shot.

Tyler Robinson, 22, is accused of shooting Kirk from the roof of the Losee Center at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10, killing the 31-year-old father of two.

Many questioned why Robinson was not spotted by Kirk's security team, who were feet away from him when he was assassinated.

CHARLIE KIRK'S KILLING AT UTAH UNIVERSITY PROMPTS SCRUTINY OF SECURITY MEASURES

On an episode of ""The Charlie Kirk Show"" Wednesday afternoon, Kolvet said the Turning Point USA security team does not have the authority to police rooftops or surrounding areas during campus speaking events.

""In defense of our security team, people need to understand that they do not have jurisdiction on the rooftops or the surrounding area,"" Kolvet said. ""Their only jurisdiction on a campus is Charlie's physical proximity, and they were coordinating with local PD and campus PD to make sure all of those venues [were secure].""

Blake Neff, producer of ""The Charlie Kirk Show,"" added Turning Point USA did not have counter snipers or Secret Service to monitor the area outside of Kirk's immediate vicinity.

Sheriff's Office)

SCRUTINY INTENSIFIES OVER SECURITY LAPSES SURROUNDING THE CHARLIE KIRK SHOOTING

""Many campus PDs do not have drone programs, which is a big problem,"" Kolvet said. ""I'm actually working on that because it's something they should all have. It should be mandated by some sort of law. … So anyway, just in quick defense of the security, they're only allowed to protect his immediate vicinity. They have to rely on PD to secure the larger perimeter.""

Drones have become an increasingly popular resource for police to monitor crowd movements, traffic flow, and potential security threats.

They are cheaper and quicker to deploy than helicopters, and can transmit live video to command centers in real time.

CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSINATION: TIMELINE OF UTAH CAMPUS SHOOTING DETAILS ATTACK, MANHUNT FOR SUSPECT

However, law enforcement still must follow Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations, and may need special waivers to fly over large groups of people, or at specific locations.

While Kirk supposedly did not raise any specific security concerns about the Sept. 10 speaking engagement at Utah Valley University, guest speaker Dr. James Orr said in the episode that Kirk acknowledged the ""risk"" of an upcoming trip to the University of Missouri on Sept. 29.

""We were putting plans in place for me to go with him to the University of Missouri,"" Orr said. ""[Kirk] said, 'You know, that's going to be the tough one. That's where it's riskiest. That's the one that's going to be the most dangerous.' I said, ‘Well, I hope you got a lot of good security.' He said, 'Yeah, it's all sorted. Don't worry about it.'""

Fox News' Eric Shawn reports the latest on the growing support for accused killer Luigi Mangione. New York Post contributor Douglas Murray also weighs in on the trend and the impact of social media on young boys during 'America's Newsroom.'

Luigi Mangione's defense lawyers are crying foul to a judge about the Trump administration and Department of Justice over references to the accused assassin as left-wing and ""anti-fascist.""

And they are accusing top government officials of violating Mangione's Fifth and Eighth Amendment rights to a fair trial by continuing to make statements about the case outside the courtroom.

They took issue with a range of incidents, including a Fox News interview in which President Donald Trump alleged, ""He shot someone in the back as clear as you're looking at me.""

In another, Mangione's lawyers wrote that ""the White House Press Secretary referred to Mr. Mangione as a 'left-wing assassin,'"" and that a different White House official called their client a ""self-described so-called anti-fascist.""

TRUMP DEFENDS LABELING ANTIFA A 'TERRORIST ORGANIZATION' AS HE TARGETS LEFT-WING EXTREMISM

""The Government has indelibly prejudiced Mr. Mangione by baselessly linking him to unrelated violent events and left-wing extremist groups, despite there being no connection or affiliation,"" wrote Karen Friedman Agnifilo, one of Mangione's top-tier defense lawyers. ""A recent, tragic, high-profile murder has only increased this prejudicial rhetoric.""

She was likely referencing the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, who was shot and killed while speaking at Utah Valley University Sept. 10. The suspect in that attack, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, is accused of engraving his bullet casings with memes and Antifa-inspired language.

Read the letter to the judge:

On Wednesday morning, another gunman opened fire at the Dallas field office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, killing two people and injuring a third before fatally shooting himself.

Authorities recovered bullets at the Dallas scene with the phrase ""Anti-ICE"" written on an unspent round.

MANGIONE DEFENSE CLAIMS HIS 'BEAUTIFUL, PROMISING LIFE DERAILED' IN UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO MURDER CASE

FBI Director Kash Patel said investigators recovered these rounds from the scene in Dallas where a gunman opened fire on the local ICE field office.  (FBI)

Mangione allegedly wrote the words ""deny,"" ""delay"" and ""depose"" on spent and unspent casings police recovered while investigating his case in what appears to be a reference to the title of a book that is critical of the U.S. health insurance industry.

The defense is accusing the DOJ of violating the rules of criminal court that balance the First Amendment with the right to a fair trial.

After receiving the defense letter, Judge Margaret Garnett gave the DOJ until Oct. 3 to respond with a sworn declaration ""from a person of suitable authority"" in the Southern District of New York to explain the incidents, which appear to have violated a prior court order from April in which the judge told prosecutors to abide by Local Criminal Rule 23.1 (a), which governs the balance between freedom of speech and a defendant's right to a fair trial.

The defense also claimed that the government, due to its possession of Mangione's journals, is aware that his writings don't mention Antifa ties.

""The Government very well knows this statement to be false as they are in possession of his alleged extensive journal writings where the writer never once mentions being anti- (or pro) fascist,"" the defense wrote.

Mangione allegedly wrote critically about the health insurance industry and wanting to ""whack"" a CEO, authorities have said. He is also accused of wanting ""to incite national debates.""

""The DOJ may have fanned the flames by portraying Luigi Mangione as a left-wing assassin,"" said Randolph Rice, an attorney and legal analyst based in the 27-year-old former Ivy Leaguer's home state of Maryland. ""His lawyers have pushed back hard, noting there's nothing in his past or his writings to support that narrative.""

The legal dogma is that prosecutors usually avoid extrajudicial statements so that they don't risk tainting the potential jury pool, Rice told Fox News Digital. But Mangione's case may have an extra level of danger if it continues to inspire shooters.

""The danger is that extremists may now view him as an inspiration, taking cues from his actions, like writing messages on bullets, to fuel their own twisted beliefs and commit violence for political purposes,"" Rice said.

The assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on Dec. 4, 2024, appears to have inspired, at least partially, the subsequent attacks in Orem, Utah, and Dallas, Texas.

Thompson, like Kirk, was a married father of two.

""Writing messages on bullets is significant because it reveals the shooter's intent even before a single round is fired,"" Rice said. ""For prosecutors, that kind of evidence is gold. It can demonstrate motive, premeditation and, in some cases, support additional charges, including hate crimes if the messaging targets a specific group.""

While the messages themselves may be evidence that prosecutors can use against shooters in court, Rice warned that copycats may increasingly be using murder to justify their political views.

""What we're seeing in Dallas and in other recent cases is a disturbing trend — radicalized individuals who aren't just committing violence but trying to make a political or ideological statement through the very ammunition they use,"" Rice told Fox News Digital. ""That's not random. It's deliberate.""

Just about two weeks before Kirk's murder in Utah, a gunman who identified as transgender opened fire on schoolchildren at a Catholic church in Minneapolis. That attacker wrote messages on his guns and magazines in an apparent reference to two other mass shooters who opened fire at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, and at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Negotiations have stalled. Trump keeps changing his policies. Ukrainians, backed by Europeans, are taking matters into their own hands. ​​​

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

In one section of a sprawling warehouse in central Ukraine, workers have stacked what appear to be small airplane wings in neat rows. In another section, a group of men is huddled around what looks like the body of an aircraft, adjusting an electronic panel. In makeshift locations elsewhere in Ukraine, workers are producing these electronic panels from scratch: This company wants to use as few imported parts as possible, avoiding anything American, anything Chinese. Jewelers, I was told, have turned out to be well suited for this kind of finicky manufacturing. Ukraine's justly celebrated manicurists are good at it too.

They are not alone in being new to the job. Everyone in this factory had a different profession three years ago, because this factory did not exist three years ago. Nor did the Ukrainian drone industry, of which it forms part. Whatever their job description before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, everyone at this production site is now part of a major shift in the politics and economics of the war, one that hasn't been fully understood by all of Ukraine's allies.

Once almost entirely dependent on imports of weapons from abroad, the Ukrainians are now producing millions of drones, large and small, as well as other kinds of weapons, every year. They are using them most famously on the front line, where they have prevented the Russians from making large-scale gains this year, despite dire headlines, and where they have ensured that any territory occupied by the Russians comes at a terrible price, in equipment and lives. The Ukrainians have also used sea drones to clear their Black Sea coast of Russian ships, an accomplishment that seemed impossible even to imagine at the start of the war.

Finally, they are using drones to hit distant targets, deep inside Russia, and lately they are hitting so many military objects, refineries, and pipelines that some Ukrainians believe they can do enough damage to force the Russians to end the war. On Monday, they once again struck Gazprom's fuel-processing plant in Astrakhan, for example, one of the largest gas-chemical complexes in the world and an important source of both gasoline and diesel. Yesterday, they hit a key part of an oil pipeline in Bryansk. Presumably President Volodymyr Zelensky transmitted this optimism to President Donald Trump, who again upended his administration's previous policies yesterday and declared that Ukraine is “in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.”

The company that I visited, Fire Point, specializes in weaponry for these long-range attacks, producing large drones that can travel up to 1,400 kilometers and stay in the air for seven hours. Fire Point recently attracted attention for its newest product, the Flamingo cruise missile, which can hit targets at 3,000 kilometers, and the company is testing ballistic missiles, too. These capabilities have put Fire Point at the cutting edge of Ukraine's most ambitious strategy: the campaign to damage Russian refineries, pipeline stations, and other economic assets, especially oil-related assets. Trump has still never applied any real pressure on Russia, and is slowly lifting the Biden administration's sanctions by refusing to update them. By targeting Russia's oil and gas industry, the Ukrainians have been applying “sanctions” on their own.

Read: Ukraine's most lethal soldiers

This campaign is not new. I spoke with a Ukrainian officer responsible for helping coordinate the long-range-bombing campaign, and he told me that “sporadic” attempts to hit targets deep in Russia began immediately after the start of the invasion. After the Ukrainians received some American drones under the aegis of a program called Phoenix Ghost, their efforts became more serious. Made for different kinds of wars, the American drones were susceptible to Russian jamming, and the U.S. imposed restrictions on their use. One former soldier now involved in drone manufacturing told me that the Ukrainians weren't necessarily prepared to use them either. He and some colleagues found boxes of drones in a warehouse along with some other U.S. equipment in the first year of the war, and figured out how to use them from videos they found on the internet. Only later did they receive real instruction. (I agreed not to identify the officer or the former soldier, who fear for their security.)

Whatever their faults, these American donations did inspire the creation of long-range-drone units. Some are part of the military; others are connected to Ukrainian intelligence. As they grew to understand the technology, the commanders of these units, just like the teams deploying battlefield drones and sea drones, concluded that they needed their own drones, as well as their own drone research and development, with a constant feedback loop between the operators on the front lines and the industrial engineers. As the officer told me, “Everything interesting started a year ago, when the Armed Forces of Ukraine started to receive mass numbers of Ukrainian-made drones.” Once their own production lines were in place, they were not trapped by technology invented somewhere else, and they could continually update it to counter advances in Russian tactics and electronic-warfare technology: “What we had two years ago or a year ago,” the officer said, “it's dramatically different from what we are operating right now.” A weapon that worked last winter might no longer have been useful over the summer.

As a result of both new technology and expanded capacity, the numbers of attacks inside Russia have increased. The officer told me that Ukraine's long-range-drone units now launch several dozen strikes on Russia every night.

Until recently, the impact of the long-range-drone campaign was hard to measure. The Ukrainians do not always admit to hitting targets deep inside Russia, and many of the targets are in obscure places, where no one is around to record the strike on a cellphone. Russian authorities also make a major effort to hide these strikes and the damage they do, both from their own population and from the rest of the world. On one occasion, Ukrainians learned from satellite pictures that their drones had successfully struck a military airport. They could see debris, oil spills, and other evidence of a successful attack. Just three hours later, all of that evidence was gone: The Russians had cleared the airfield and cleaned the tarmac.

Sometimes evidence emerges anyway, usually via a home video, posted to Telegram, made by a Russian who happens to be near a burning factory or exploding refinery and is shouting for his wife to come and look. But even so, it can be hard to know whether these dramatic fires are caused by drones or by Ukraine's even more clandestine sabotage campaign inside Russia, alleged to have both Russian and Ukrainian participants. The vacuum has left the field open for what the officer called “fake experts,” and sometimes false claims from those who want to steal credit.

But the Ukrainian military does keep careful track of the damage being done, and has thought carefully about how to prioritize certain targets. It has disrupted airports and hit weapons factories and depots. The Ukrainian officer told me that, early on in the war, his colleagues realized that the Russians are not deterred by the deaths of their soldiers: “Russia can sustain extremely high levels of casualties and losses in human lives. They don't care about people's lives.” However, “it is painful for them to lose money.” They need money to fund their oligarchy, as well as to bribe their soldiers to fight: “So naturally, we need to reduce the amount of money available for them.” Oil and oil products provide the majority of Russia's state income. This is how the oil industry became the Ukrainians' most important target.

The campaign against the oil industry has been helped by the degradation of Russian air defenses, which had been moved closer to the border of Ukraine and at the moment aren't numerous enough to cover every possible economic target across a very large country. Since August, 16 of 38 Russian refineries have been hit, some multiple times. Among them are  facilities in Samara, Krasnodar, Volgograd, Novokuibyshevsk, and Ryazan, among others, as well as oil depots in Sochi; an oil terminal at Primorsk, in the Baltic; and pumping stations along another pipeline that supplies crude oil in Ust-Luga, in the northern part of the Baltic. In August, the Ukrainians also hit the Unecha pumping station, a crucial part of the Druzhba pipeline that links Russia and Europe and still supplies oil to Hungary and Slovakia, the two European countries that have sought to block or undermine sanctions on Ukraine (and the only two European NATO states who, alongside Turkey, import Russian oil at all).

Read: Ukraine's warning to the world's other military forces

The result: Russian overall oil exports are now at their lowest point since the start of the war, and the Russians are running out of oil at home. The commander of Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces has said that more than a fifth of Russian refining capacity has been destroyed. The regime has banned the export of refined oil products, because there isn't enough for the domestic market. Gas stations are closed or badly supplied in areas across the country, including the suburbs of Moscow and St. Petersburg. Telegram accounts post videos of cars waiting in enormous lines. Earlier this month, Izvestiya, a state-owned newspaper, actually admitted to its readers that severe fuel shortages are spreading across central and eastern Russia, as well as in Crimea, a problem it attributed, laughably, to “the seasonal increase in fuel demand and the growth of tourism activity.”

Quietly, Europeans are backing Ukraine's strategy. The Germans will invest $10.5 billion in support for Ukraine this year and next, a large chunk of which will be spent building drones. Sweden has pledged $7.4 billion. The European Union's decision to invest $6 billion in a “Drone Alliance” with Ukraine is mostly designed to build anti-drone defenses along Europe's eastern border, but that money will also accelerate production and benefit Ukraine as well.

Both the Ukrainians and their European allies are also looking harder at the so-called shadow fleet, the oil tankers now traveling around the world under flags of convenience, fraudulent flags, or no flags at all, carrying illicit Russian oil. Many are old, dangerous boats, with inexperienced crew and little or no insurance. Some have been involved in accidents already, and they could do real environmental damage in the Baltic Sea. Sweden, Germany, and Denmark have all announced that they will check the papers of these shadow tankers and sanction those that aren't insured, adding them to a growing list of sanctioned ships. The point, for the moment, is not just to protect the environment but to raise the costs of Russian oil exports and thus to reduce the amount of money flowing into Russia and back up Ukraine's air campaign. More extreme measures, including banning these unmarked, uninsured ships from the Baltic altogether, are under consideration too.

But that will take time, which no one in Ukraine wants to waste. No one wants to wait for Trump to impose new sanctions on Russia either. Drones, which can defend the front line and take the battle deep into Russia, can do more. In an address to the nation on September 14, Zelensky put it very clearly: “The most effective sanctions—the ones that work the fastest—are the fires at Russia's oil refineries, its terminals, oil depots.” In the absence of an American policy that offers something other than rhetoric, the Ukrainians, backed by Europe, will pursue their own solution.

The ratings aren't in yet for Jimmy Kimmel's return — but his monologue is already the show's most-watched video of the year on YouTube.

The show's official YouTube account shared Kimmel's 28-minute monologue late Tuesday night, and it's quickly gone viral, amassing over 13 million views so far.

Although the monologue has around 69 million fewer views than Kimmel's most popular video — ""Cast of Avengers: Infinity War Draws their Characters"" — it's a noticeable jump compared to others the late-night show published on YouTube this year.

People are also Googling to see how Kimmel's return performed, with break-out searches for ""what were the ratings for jimmy kimmel last night"" and ""how many people watched jimmy kimmel tonight.""

Representatives for ABC and ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Kimmel's highly anticipated return aired less than a week after ABC, owned by Disney, suspended ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" over Kimmel's remarks about conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who died after being shot on September 10.

After FCC Chair Brendan Carr criticized Kimmel and suggested the agency could get involved, major ABC affiliates Nexstar and Sinclair said they wouldn't air ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" on their stations. Despite Disney and ABC bringing Kimmel back, Nexstar and Sinclair have said they would continue not to air Kimmel's show.

Kimmel's initial suspension drew backlash from many, including some prominent conservatives who voiced free speech concerns, though President Donald Trump and many on the right praised the move. Many celebrities and fellow late-night hosts rallied behind Kimmel, while some politicians called the decision a ""dangerous escalation.""

Calls to boycott Disney after Kimmel's suspension led many to cancel their Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions. (Kimmel appeared to reference the cancellations in his Tuesday monologue, reading aloud instructions for how to reactivate a Disney+ account.)

Trump criticized ABC and Disney in a Truth Social post ahead of Kimmel's return on Tuesday, writing that he ""can't believe"" the host got his ""job back.""

During his monologue, Kimmel said Trump ""can't take a joke.""

Kimmel also played a clip of Trump saying the late-night host had ""no ratings.""

""Well, I do tonight,"" Kimmel quipped.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","The 20 financial firms that could be hardest hit from Trump's new H-1B fee — from Goldman Sachs to Citi","https://www.businessinsider.com/h1b-visa-fees-rule-change-financial-industry-jobs-jpmorgan-goldman-2025-9","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Silicon Valley isn't the only industry reeling from President Donald Trump's plans to charge companies hiring skilled foreign workers $100,000 for visas.

Wall Street banks and other financial firms have long used the H-1B visa program to fill an array of roles, from computer programmers to traders and even investment bankers.Trump's executive order, signed late Friday, ""caught everyone off guard,"" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said on CNBC while in Mumbai, India, this week.

In order to visualize the potential impact on the financial industry, Business Insider turned to publicly available data from the Department of Labor and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The data covers H-1B application data for the first three quarters of the government fiscal year 2025, as well as the less-common H-1B1 and E-3 visas, from October of 2024 to the end of June this year.

We studied certified visa applications during this time period to highlight the biggest financial industry users of the visa program. The data does not reflect the total number of H-1B employees at any given firm, but it provides helpful context on immigrant labor demands.

The data shows that some of the largest financial employers heavily rely on this visa to fill a range of roles, especially technology roles. Major banks like Chase and Goldman Sachs dominate the list alongside major payments companies like American Express. Asset managers like BlackRock and Vanguard, and research and ratings agency Moody's, help to round it out.

Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Citigroup declined to comment. The others did not respond to a request for comment from BI.

Certified applications: 2,440

Employees worldwide: 317,160 as of the second quarter of 2025

The country's largest bank focused its H-1B hiring heavily on technologists, with more than 500 certified applications for vice president, lead software engineer, and associate software engineer III positions. The bank also filed visa applications for the firm's main business lines, such as an investment banking managing director.

Certified applications: 1,575

Employees worldwide: Over 78,000 per its website

Fidelity submitted a wide range of applications for technical roles, with 40 certified applications for full-stack engineering directors and 125 for full-stack engineering principals. Non-technical roles included a director of marketing.

Certified applications: 1,280

Not all of Goldman Sachs' certified applications specified the role, focusing instead on the level of hire, such as an associate. The data, however, does show a wide range of technologist hires and financial hires, including many vice president-level banking roles.

Certified applications: 921

Employees worldwide: 75,100 as of the end of 2024

American Express's certified applications were largely for technologist roles, with more than 125 for""engineer"" roles. Business Insider also found applications for non-technical roles, including director-level applications for risk management, communications, and controller.

Certified applications: 871

Employees worldwide: 76,500 as of the second quarter of 2025

Employees worldwide: 213,000 as of the second quarter of 2025

Bank of America also focused its applications on tech hiring. Their most common role on the list, a vice president-level software engineer III, could be found on over 100 applications.

Certified applications: 673

Employees worldwide: 80,000 as of the first quarter of 2025

Morgan Stanley's data only showed the level of roles it was hiring for, so we cannot analyze what kinds of jobs its looking to fill. However, we can see that they have applied for vice president-level roles the most, followed by associates and then directors.

Certified applications: 624

Employees worldwide: More than 70,000 per their company website

US Bank is yet another bank that largely uses H-1B visas for for technology roles, such as senior software engineer. There are other financial roles though, like tax accountant, underwriter, and project manager for the firm's impact finance, focused on affordable housing.

Certified applications: 457

Employees worldwide: 92,900 as of the end of 2024

The British bank's US visa hiring is also largely focused on technology. Some front-office hires included an equities derivatives trader and an equities ""exotic"" trader.

Certified applications: 434

Employees worldwide: 32,600 per the firm's website

Charles Schwab is also using H-1B visa to hire tech talent, with the data showing nearly 50 software development and engineering senior manager roles and nearly 100 software development and engineering manager hires. We were unable to find a single role that didn't appear to be related to technology.

Certified applications: 391

Employees worldwide: 217,000 at the end of 2024

Wells Fargo joins the ranks of financial firms largely focused on technological hires in its H-1B visa applications. The data also showed certified applications for roles like lead securities trader and strategy and planning director.

Certified applications: 339

Employees worldwide: 110,323 as of the end of 2024

Certified applications: 294

Employees worldwide: Approximately 22,000 per the firm's website.

Like Morgan Stanley, BlackRock only provides the level of roles hired. The bulk of roles culled by Business Insider were at the associate or vice president level, though there are also more than 20 director-level applications.

Certified applications: 213

Employees worldwide: Approximately 53,000 as of the first quarter of 2025

State Street's visa applications were largely focused on technology hires, though financial roles were also on the menu. Non-financial roles included applications for a head of internal liquidity stress testing in treasury and a global head of liquidity risk oversight.

Certified applications: 209

Employees worldwide: Approximately 20,000 per the firm's website as of the end of 2024

A large chunk of Vanguard's applications were for application engineering and other technical roles. The asset management firm also had applications for a fixed-income trader, a head of wealth management and advice, and a head of fraud, strategy, and analytics.

Certified applications: 199

Employees worldwide: 15,838 at the end of 2024

The ratings and research powerhouse joins the rest on the list with a focus on technologists. Senior software engineers and staff software engineers lead the way in certified applications. Some non-technical applications included a director-level sales manager, a credit associate, and a commercial real estate researcher.

Certified applications: 185

Employees worldwide: 38,335 as of the end of 2024

Software engineering roles made up roughly half of Truist's applications reviewed by Business Insider. Most other roles were tech-focused, such as a senior data analyst in liquidity and regulatory reporting, though there were some rare non-tech roles, such as Treasury market and liquidity risk officer.

Certified applications: 144

Employees worldwide: 21,000 as of the end of 2024

Discover joins the ranks of others on this list with roughly 100 applications mentioning data science. Other interesting technical roles included a lead robotic process automation analyst.

The National Football League's finance committee approved the sale of 2.35% of the Chicago Bears to existing owners of the team in a deal that sets a league record and values the Bears at $8.9 billion, according to three people familiar with the deal, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly. 

The deal closed several days ago, according to one of the people. Because the sale is to existing team owners, the league does not require the deal to be approved by three-fourths of the NFL's owners.

The Bears were valued at $6.4 billion just a year ago in CNBC's Official NFL Team Valuations — No. 10 among the league's 32 teams. The team rose to No. 7 in CNBC's 2025 valuations.

The stake of the Bears that was sold was held by the estate of Andrew McKenna, according to two people familiar with the deal. McKenna died in 2023. Galatioto Sports Partners represented the estate in the sale, said the people, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Two-thirds of the 2.3% sold will go to the McCaskey family and one-third will go to the Ryan family, leaving the former with about 77% ownership and the latter with about 23%, the people said.

Neither the NFL nor Galatioto Sports Partners responded to emailed questions from CNBC about the sale.

The previous record high valuation in the sale of a minority stake in an NFL team was $8.6 billion, in the purchase of a 6.2% stake of the San Francisco 49ers in May, according to a person familiar with the deal, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly. That topped the $8.3 billion valuation for an 8% stake in the Philadelphia Eagles at the end of 2024, CNBC previously reported. The New York Giants are currently looking to sell a 10% stake at about a $10 billion valuation, CNBC previously reported.

The Bears currently play at the obsolete Soldier Field, which was last renovated more than 20 years ago. The Chicago Park District gets some of the revenue from non-NFL events at the stadium. The team is exploring building a stadium in Arlington Heights, a suburb of Chicago. A fixed-roof domed stadium would give the Bears an opportunity to host non-NFL events year-round and get more non-NFL event revenue.

Valuations for the sale of limited partner stakes do not necessarily translate to control sale prices. Large LP stakes, say, above 20%, typically sell at discounts to control sale valuations because limited partners have no stake in how the team is run and the dollar amount to buy the stake is relatively large. In some cases, however, small LP stakes, say, below 10%, can sell at a premium to a control sale valuation because an LP stake may be the only opportunity a person has to own a piece of an NFL team due to skyrocketing valuations and the actual dollar amount required to buy such a stake is relatively small.

The last control sale of an NFL team was Josh Harris' purchase of the Washington Commanders for $6.05 billion in 2023, according to media reports.

In this article

UniQure's experimental gene therapy for Huntington's disease slowed progression of the brain disorder by 75% in an early-to-mid stage study, it said on Wednesday.

Shares of the company more than tripled in midday trading, skyrocketing 250%.

Huntington's is a rare inherited brain disorder, which steadily worsens and typically leads to death 10 to 30 years after symptoms begin. There are no FDA-approved treatments for the condition.

UniQure's therapy, called AMT-130, reduced disease progression by 75% at 36 months in patients who received a high dose, based on a widely used clinical scale.

It also slowed decline of functional abilities in patients by 60%, a key secondary goal of the trial.

""These groundbreaking data are the most convincing in the field to date and underscore potential disease-modifying effects in Huntington's disease, where an urgent need persists,"" said Sarah Tabrizi, director of the University College London's Huntington's Disease Center.

AMT-130 was generally well-tolerated, with no new serious side effects reported since late 2022, the company said.

UniQure plans to submit a marketing application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in early 2026, with hopes of launching the therapy later that year if approved.

About 41,000 people in the U.S. are living with the disease, and more than 200,000 are at risk of inheriting it, according to Huntington's disease Society of America.

A gunman on Wednesday opened fire at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas, killing one detainee and critically wounding two other detainees, officials said.

The gunman was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after firing ""indiscriminately"" at the ICE field office building from a nearby rooftop, the Department of Homeland Security said. No ICE officers were hurt in the attack.

DHS initially reported that two of the victims had been killed, but later issued a corrected press release.

The suspect was identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, who has lived in Texas and Oklahoma, senior law enforcement officials told NBC News.

FBI Director Kash Patel said an ""initial review of the evidence shows an [ideological] motive behind this attack.""

""One of the unspent shell casings recovered was engraved with the phrase 'ANTI ICE,"" Patel wrote in a post on X, which included a photo of the casings.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other top Trump administration officials quickly linked the attack to what they characterized as extreme left-wing rhetoric against ICE.

""This vile attack was motivated by hatred for ICE,"" Noem said. ""This shooting must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences.""

President Donald Trump, in a Truth Social post, connected the Dallas incident to the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk by a shooter who allegedly opposed Kirk's political conduct.

""I will be signing an Executive Order this week to dismantle these Domestic Terrorism Networks,"" Trump wrote in the post, without elaborating.

Jahn was registered to vote as an independent, according to NBC, citing officials.

Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin in a statement called the Dallas shooting ""another horrific act of violence.""

""Let me be clear: It will take all of us — not just one side of the aisle or the other — to quell this epidemic of violence, which has no place in our democracy,"" Martin said. 

""Democrats remain committed to resolving differences through debate and elections, not with weapons. We also remain committed to enacting commonsense solutions to curb gun violence all across our country,"" he said.

ICE has become a locus of controversy in Trump's second term as it carries out unprecedented operations to remove millions of undocumented immigrants from the United States.

Joe Rothrock, special agent in charge of the FBI's Dallas field office, said the shooting was only the latest example of violence targeting ICE in Texas.

Rothrock noted that there was a ""coordinated attack"" on an immigrant detention center in the city of Alvarado on July 4.

In that incident, 10 were charged with attempted murder of a federal officer and discharging a firearm during and in relation to a violent crime.

A federal criminal complaint says that the group shot fireworks toward the center and vandalized vehicles and the facility.

An Alvarado police officer police officer who responded to the disturbance was shot in the neck by one of the people in the crowd, and another person shot multiple rounds at correctional officers, the complaint alleged.

At Wednesday's conference, Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson thanked law enforcement who responded to the shooting, and called for people to come together in prayer for the nation.

""There's a lot going on right now in our country, a lot that's confusing,"" Johnson said.

""Please pray for everyone who's affected by today's tragedy.""

Johnson called for patience from the public while the investigation into the shooting continues.

Oops, something went wrong

Brian Armstrong, the CEO of American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc, is quite optimistic that Bitcoin price will reach $1 million within the next 5 years. He made this bold prediction during an appearance on Fox Business News. The crypto insider's optimism stems from the current outlook and sentiments within the crypto industry.

Coming from Armstrong, who is largely known for avoiding making such specific predictions, the statement sparked some reactions from the broader crypto community. He believes that the sustainability and advancement in certain current outlooks could push BTC price to the target.

He cited the availability of robust crypto regulatory frameworks in the United States, like the GENIUS Act. In his opinion, tightening such US regulations would go a long way in fueling a significant price rally for the flagship cryptocurrency. Also, there is growing institutional adoption of digital assets, especially Bitcoin.

Firms like Strategy and Metaplanet have taken Bitcoin adoption to a whole new level, consistently filling up their bags. The Michael Saylor-led firm currently holds about 639,835 BTC. With the current price of Bitcoin ($112,466.45), this stash is worth approximately $71.96 billion. Metaplanet holds up to 25,555 BTC, valued at nearly $3 billion.

In line with this Bitcoin adoption, Nasdaq-listed Fold Holdings announced the upcoming launch of its Bitcoin Rewards Credit Card. This is in collaboration with Stripe, which will provide the backend infrastructure, and Visa serving as the issuing network.

Beyond US regulation and growing institutional adoption, Armstrong also highlighted the fixed maximum supply of the top digital asset. All of these entities are aiming for Bitcoin's 21 million supply, a move that will fuel scarcity, triggering a price rally.

Before now, the digital asset industry has seen some prominent names like Jack Dorsey and Cathie Wood share similar bullish views on the Bitcoin price. Right after the US Federal Reserve “third mandate” was hinted at, with an attempt at yield curve control, veteran crypto investor Arthur Hayes also predicted a Bitcoin price rally to $1 million.

At the time of this writing, Bitcoin was trading at $112,466.45, with a 0.64% decline over the last 24 hours.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Coinbase CEO Predicts $1M Bitcoin, Citing Policy Tailwinds","https://bitbo.io/news/coinbase-ceo-bitcoin-2030/","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 18:00:14 GMT","

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has projected that Bitcoin could hit $1 million per coin by 2030, pointing to several accelerating factors behind his bullish outlook.

Armstrong highlighted recent bipartisan progress on U.S. Bitcoin legislation, the government's efforts to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, and strong demand from institutional investors through spot Bitcoin ETFs.

He stated in an interview:

“There's a good chance that Bitcoin could reach $1 million per coin by 2030. Regulatory clarity, the U.S. government beginning to hold Bitcoin, and a significant influx of institutional investment through Bitcoin ETFs could be massive drivers of demand.”

Armstrong credited the Trump-era push for clearer Bitcoin regulations, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, and noted that bipartisan support in Congress is now fueling broader market structure legislation.

He described the momentum as unstoppable, saying:

“This freight train has left the station.”

Looking ahead, Armstrong reiterated Coinbase's ambition to replace traditional banks by offering payments, rewards, and comprehensive financial services.

He cited Coinbase's new credit card with 4% Bitcoin rewards as an example and commented:

“Crypto can make the financial system more modern, fair, and efficient. Our job is to keep pushing on that frontier.”

Armstrong emphasized the growing role of institutions and governments in the Bitcoin market. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to see inflows, while the idea of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve gains traction among policymakers.

Armstrong also shared a story about helping NBA star Kevin Durant, an early Coinbase investor, regain access to his lost Bitcoin account, underlining the platform's role in onboarding and supporting new users.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told Fox Business that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030, while warning of resistance from the banking industry.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes Bitcoin could reach $1 million per coin by the end of this decade — but only if policymakers hold the line against bank lobbyists trying to choke the industry.

“I think Bitcoin could reach $1M by ~2030 based on current conditions and progress,” Armstrong posted this week along with an interview on Fox Business. 

Armstrong pointed to regulatory clarity, U.S. government Bitcoin reserves, and ETF adoption as key drivers of demand.

His optimism comes as Congress works with two major pieces of crypto legislation: the Genius Act, providing rules for stablecoins was signed into law earlier this year, and the broader Clarity Act, which establishes market structure for all non-stablecoin assets. 

Armstrong, who has been roaming Capitol Hill to advocate for the measures, called the legislation “historic” and credited President Donald Trump and Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN) for pushing the U.S. toward becoming the “crypto capital of the world.”

But he warned that big banks are already trying to derail progress. Their latest target: banning rewards programs tied to stablecoins and bitcoin, which threaten the lucrative credit card rewards industry.

“Every company should be able to have reward programs, just like credit card points or airline miles,” Armstrong said on Fox Business. “For [the banks] to come in and try to ban that in the crypto industry is them trying to block their competition, I think most members of the Senate are not going to do a big bailout for the banks.” 

The fight goes deeper than perks. For Armstrong, the debate over rewards exposes the larger conflict between legacy financial institutions and open, crypto-powered rails. 

Banks rely on closed networks and swipe fees; stablecoins and bitcoin payments offer instant settlement and cheaper costs. Allowing crypto rewards is a step toward normalizing an alternative financial infrastructure — one that doesn't run through the big banks.

That, Armstrong argues, is precisely why Wall Street is lobbying so hard. But Armstrong sees the shift as inevitable. 

Coinbase itself has ambitions to be more than an exchange. Armstrong described the company as building a “super app” to replace legacy banks, offering trading, custody, payments, savings, and bitcoin-denominated rewards. 

“Ultimately we want to be a bank replacement for people. We want to be people's primary financial account,” he said.

 Bitcoin bulls are trying to seize control but are expected to face strong selling at $117,500. Will altcoins capitalize on BTC's potential range-bound price action? 

Key points:

Bitcoin made a strong comeback on Wednesday, but the buyers are expected to face heavy selling near $117,500.

Several major altcoins are likely to face selling on rallies, but BNB and AVAX may resume their uptrend.

Bitcoin (BTC) rose above $113,900 on Wednesday, indicating that the bulls continue to buy on dips. Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor said on CNBC that consistent buying by large BTC exchange-traded funds on behalf of institutional investors and increased corporate adoption of BTC could resume the BTC rally toward the end of the year.

Glassnode also said in its weekly report that BTC could hit a new all-time high, but added that history shows the cycle is in its late phase. BTC's current cycle shows similarities with the 2015–2018 and 2018–2022 bull runs, where all-time highs “occurred only 2–3 months beyond where we currently stand when measured from the cycle low.”

However, not everyone is bullish on BTC's prospects in the future. CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno said in a post on X that whales have net sold 147,000 BTC since Aug. 21. That has resulted in the total whale holdings “declining at the fastest monthly rate of the cycle.”

Could BTC overcome selling by the bears and rise to $117,500? Will altcoins follow BTC higher? Let's analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

BTC has started a relief rally, which is expected to face strong selling at the moving averages.

If the price turns down sharply from the moving averages, the possibility of a drop to $107,000 increases. Buyers are expected to defend the $107,000 level with all their might because a break below it will complete a bearish double-top pattern. That may start a decline to $100,000 and eventually to the pattern target of $89,526.

Conversely, if buyers pierce the moving averages, the BTC/USDT pair could rally to $117,500. Sellers could pose a substantial challenge at $117,500, but if the bulls overcome it, the Bitcoin price could reach $120,000.

Buyers are trying to maintain Ether (ETH) above the $4,060 level but are expected to face heavy selling on relief rallies.

If the price turns down from the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) ($4,393), it enhances the prospects of a break below the $4,060 support. If that happens, the ETH/USDT pair could collapse to $3,745 and then to the pattern target of $3,426.

Instead, if the price turns up and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it signals the possibility of a range formation. The Ether price could swing between $4,060 and $4,957 for some time.

XRP (XRP) has been trading inside a descending triangle, which usually acts as a topping pattern.

The bears will have to yank the price below the $2.69 level to complete the bearish setup. If that happens, the selling could pick up and the XRP/USDT pair could move downward toward $2.20.

If buyers want to prevent the downside move, they will have to swiftly drive the XRP price above the downtrend line. That will invalidate the bearish setup, setting the stage for a rally to $3.40.

BNB (BNB) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($957) on Tuesday, indicating that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips.

The bulls will try to strengthen their position by pushing the price above the $1,083 resistance. If they succeed, the BNB/USDT pair could start the next leg of the uptrend toward $1,187.

Contrarily, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bears are selling on rallies. That increases the risk of a drop to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) ($882).

Solana (SOL) slipped below the uptrend line on Wednesday, but the bulls are trying to halt the pullback at the 50-day SMA ($206).

The sellers are unlikely to give up and will try to pull the price below the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the SOL/USDT pair could decline to $185 and then to $175. That signals the Solana price may extend its stay inside the large $110 to $260 range for a few more days.

Alternatively, a break and close above the 20-day EMA indicates solid buying on dips. The bulls will then try to kick the price to $260, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense.

Dogecoin (DOGE) is taking support at the 50-day SMA ($0.23), indicating that the bulls are fiercely defending the level.

The relief rally is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($0.25). If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a drop to $0.21 increases. That suggests the DOGE/USDT pair may remain inside the large $0.14 to $0.29 range for a while longer.

Contrary to this assumption, a break above the 20-day EMA shows demand at lower levels. The bulls will then try to push the Dogecoin price to $0.29. This is a crucial level for the bears to defend because a break above $0.29 clears the path for a rally to $0.35 and then to $0.44.

Buyers are trying to defend the $0.78 support in Cardano (ADA), but the relief rallies are likely to be sold into.

If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA ($0.86), the bears will make one more attempt to sink the ADA/USDT pair below $0.78. If they can pull it off, the Cardano price could tumble to $0.68.

Buyers are likely to have other plans. They will try to push the price back into the triangle and trap the aggressive bears. The up move is expected to pick up momentum above the resistance line. That opens the gates for a rally to $1.02.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) plunged below the uptrend line on Tuesday, indicating that the bulls are rushing to the exit.

The 20-day EMA ($50.67) has started to turn down, and the relative strength index (RSI) is near the 41 level, indicating that the HYPE/USDT pair may have topped out in the near term. Sellers will try to halt any recovery attempt at the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the Hyperliquid price could turn down and drop to $40 and, after that, to $35.

This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the bulls push and retain the pair above the 20-day EMA. The pair may then retest the all-time high at $59.

Buyers have successfully defended the uptrend line in Chainlink (LINK) but are struggling to start a strong bounce off it. 

The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover, and the RSI is in the negative zone, signaling an advantage to bears. Any recovery is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($23.11). If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and breaks below the uptrend line, it suggests that the bears are back in the game. The LINK/USDT pair may then descend to $18.

Buyers will have to drive the Chainlink price above the downtrend line to gain the upper hand. The pair may then climb toward the $27 overhead resistance.

Avalanche (AVAX) turned up sharply from the 20-day EMA ($30.71) on Monday, but the bulls could not clear the overhead hurdle at $36.17 on Tuesday.

A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. The upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the overbought territory indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers push and maintain the price above $36.17, the AVAX/USDT pair could surge to the pattern target of $39.49 and then to $45.

The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-day EMA. That suggests profit booking by short-term traders. AVAX price could then slump to $27.38.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

The following article is adapted from The Block's newsletter, The Daily, which comes out on weekday afternoons.

Happy Wednesday! Wondering what's next after one of the largest long liquidation events of the year this week? We've got you covered.

In today's newsletter, Tom Lee says Wall Street's blockchain of choice is Ethereum, Flare launches a wrapped version of XRP for DeFi, Tether seeks to raise at a $500 billion valuation, and more.

Meanwhile, Hyperliquid's home-grown stablecoin USDH goes live after Native Markets' winning bid.

Let's get started!

P.S. Don't forget to check out The Funding, a biweekly rundown of crypto VC trends. It's a great read — and just like The Daily, it's free to subscribe!

Fundstrat co-founder and BitMine Chairman Tom Lee called Ethereum a ""truly neutral chain"" and said Wall Street and the White House are coalescing around it as their blockchain of choice.

Flare Network has launched FXRP, a non-custodial, overcollateralized wrapped version of XRP that can be minted and used across DeFi protocols.

Tether is reportedly in talks with investors to raise as much as $20 billion at a $500 billion valuation — which would place it among the world's most valuable private companies, ranking alongside Sam Altman's OpenAI and Elon Musk's SpaceX.

The FTX Recovery Trust sued Genesis Digital Assets, calling Sam Bankman-Fried's investment from sister firm Alameda in the bitcoin miner one of his most reckless uses of commingled funds.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission unveiled a new initiative to let derivatives traders post tokenized assets like stablecoins as collateral, Acting Chair Caroline Pham announced Tuesday.

 Coinbase Ventures led a $14.6 million round for Bastion, a startup providing white-label stablecoin issuance with backing from Sony, Samsung, A16z and others. 

Update (Sept. 24, 5:45 pm UTC): This article has been updated to correct the date of Bastion's $25 million raise in September 2023.

Stablecoin infrastructure startup Bastion has raised $14.6 million in a funding round led by Coinbase Ventures, the company said Wednesday.

According to a Wednesday announcement, the round also saw the participation of Japanese tech giant Sony, the investment subsidiary of South Korean phone maker Samsung, the crypto arm of venture capital (VC) firm Andreessen Horowitz and crypto VC firm Hashed.

Bastion is developing a platform that allows companies to issue stablecoins without securing their own licenses or building custom infrastructure.

The startup has now raised around $40 million. Bastion closed a $25 million funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz in September 2023. The company said at the time it had been “building in stealth mode” for months before the raise.

Bastion is a company purpose-built to issue stablecoins for third parties, rather than developing them for themselves. Still, the company offers more than just stablecoin issuance.

Earlier this month, the company explained that thanks to its services, “organizations of any size can now seamlessly integrate Web3 infrastructure into existing technologies through a compliant, white-label platform and API that includes custodial wallets, smart transaction routing, and data analytics.”

Bastion claimed this approach allows building better Web3 products “with the cost-efficiency, compliance, and security they expect from a Web2 technology stack.” The company expects that this will lead to higher growth in the Web3 space:

Nassim Eddequiouaq, Bastion co-founder and CEO, said the company “is growing to meet significant demand for regulated stablecoin infrastructure from some of the world's largest enterprises.” He added:

The raise highlights increasing interest from large corporations in stablecoin technology. Earlier this week, Bullish Europe became the first platform to offer a stablecoin backed by finance giant Société Générale.

Kazakhstan's central bank also launched a pilot project with a new stablecoin pegged to the local fiat currency in collaboration with Solana and Mastercard. In another example, payments behemoth PayPal expanded its PayPal USD stablecoin across eight new blockchains earlier this month.

At the end of July, EURAU, a new euro stablecoin venture backed by Deutsche Bank's DWS, Flow Traders and Mike Novogratz's Galaxy, made its way to the Ethereum blockchain.

Bastion had not responded to Cointelegraph's request for comment by publication.

 Chainlink integrated its data services and crosschain protocol into the institutional blockchain Canton Network and joined as a super validator. 

Chainlink has integrated with the Canton Network, an institutional blockchain backed by global banks and technology firms, in a move aimed at strengthening institutional adoption of blockchain technology.

The partnership, announced Wednesday, brings Chainlink's data service, including its data streams, smartdata (proof of reserve and NAVLink) and the crosschain interoperability protocol (CCIP) onto the Canton Network. The network has also joined the Chainlink Scale program, which helps cover oracle operating costs. 

As part of the agreement, Chainlink Labs will become a Canton Network “super validator.” A super validator is a combined node that runs a domain validator and a Canton synchronizer node. It participates in the Global Synchronizer to order and finalize cross-domain transactions, providing consensus and interoperability across the network.

Yuval Rooz, CEO of Canton Network developer Digital Asset, said, “Chainlink not only strengthens our governance and resilience, but also broadens the opportunities for innovators across traditional and decentralized finance.” 

Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said that he expects the collaboration to enable “large-scale real-world use cases” that combine traditional and decentralized capital markets.

Launched in May 2023, the Canton Network was designed as an institutional blockchain to support tokenization and large-scale financial activity. It was developed with the backing of tech behemoth Microsoft, finance heavyweights Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribas and Cboe Global Markets, and crypto natives Digital Asset and Paxos.

The network's governing body, formerly known as the Global Synchronizer Foundation, recently rebranded as the Canton Foundation. The foundation includes major validators such as Chainlink.

With its long list of influential partners, the Canton Network has seen significant growth since its launch. According to the announcement, Canton now supports over $6 trillion in onchain real-world assets, processes $280 billion of repurchase agreements daily and is backed by a network of 500 validators and more than 30 super validators.

The news follows recent reports that P2P.org has become a validator on the Canton Network. Earlier this month, the network also attracted the backing of major global banks BNP Paribas and HSBC, both of which joined the Canton Foundation.

Infections of Drug-Resistant ‘Nightmare Bacteria' Are Surging in Hospitals

The infection rate of one type of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales bacteria has risen by more than 460 percent in recent years. Scientists say people receiving treatment in hospitals are at highest risk

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is raising alarm about a sharp spike in infections from dangerous bacteria that are resistant to some of the strongest antibiotics.

A report released on Tuesday by CDC scientists found that, between 2019 and 2023, there was as much as a 461 percent increase in the infection rate of certain bacteria in the group Enterobacterales that can thwart many antibiotic treatments, including a powerful class of drugs known as carbapenems. Carbapenems are used to treat severe multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, including pneumonia and bloodstream, bone and urinary tract infections. These carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) infections are notoriously difficult to treat and can be fatal: In 2020 alone, CRE caused about 12,700 infections and 1,100 deaths in the U.S. Former CDC director Tom Frieden once called CRE “nightmare bacteria.”

The report's authors note that CRE infections are still considered rare and mostly occur in hospital settings. Still, the rise in infections highlighted in the new study is cause for some concern.

“It was shocking to see how large of an increase it was,” says Danielle Rankin, a co-author of the new report and an epidemiologist at the CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion. “The biggest thing for us is that we understand where this is happening because we want to ensure that this does not go outside of health care settings [and] into the community and cause more difficult to treat infections.”

The group Enterobacterales encompasses a wide number of common germs, including Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. One way bacterial species turn into CRE is by picking up specific genes that allow them to evade antibiotics, such as by giving them the ability to make carbapenemases, enzymes that inactivate carbapenems.

The study's authors analyzed cases in 29 states that require hospitals to report and send CRE samples to local public health departments for testing. They looked at overall changes in CRE infection rates, as well as the prevalence of five different types of genes that code for carbapenemases. Overall, the researchers found a 69 percent increase in the rate of CRE infections that involved carbapenemase-producing genes between 2019 and 2013. “We saw this increase in at least every region,” Rankin says.

Among CRE with these genes, those with a gene that codes for an enzyme called New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase, or NDM, had the largest jump in infection rate—461 percent. Such so-called NDM-CRE bacteria are known to spread easily through health care facilities via medical equipment such as ventilators and intravenous tubing. People receiving treatment in these care settings are currently at highest risk, but Rankin says it's not out of the realm of possibility for NDM-CRE infections to occur in other environments.

“The antibiotics we have that are effective against NDM-CRE are only available through IV. They are not an oral antibiotic you can take,” Rankin says. “We are concerned because there is risk that this could spread into communities, meaning that common infections like urinary tract infections that are usually treated with the oral antibiotics may increasingly need to be treated with the IV antibiotics and require hospitalization.”

Rankin notes that the situation with NDM-CRE also plays a part in the larger antimicrobial resistance crisis. “These are genes that can transfer resistance across different bacterial species,” she says.

CDC scientists are still investigating, but they suspect several factors are involved. NDM-CRE can spread from improper hand hygiene among health care providers or inadequate cleaning and disinfection of equipment. Other key factors are insufficient testing and limited access to detection tools. “When NDM-CRE infections are not identified quickly, earlier treatment with effective antibiotics and infection control interventions may be delayed, which can then create more opportunities for transmission from patient to patient,” Rankin says.

She hopes the report shows the importance of using specialized testing to detect these drug-resistant genes so that health care providers can deliver effective—and potentially lifesaving—treatments.

""This concerns the biosynthesis of a molecule that has a very long history with humans,"" explains Prof. Dirk Hoffmeister, head of the research group Pharmaceutical Microbiology at Friedrich Schiller University Jena and the Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology (Leibniz-HKI). ""We are referring to psilocybin, a substance found in so-called 'magic mushrooms', which our body converts into psilocin - a compound that can profoundly alter consciousness. However, psilocybin not only triggers psychedelic experiences, but is also considered a promising active compound in the treatment of therapy-resistant depression,"" says Hoffmeister.

Two paths, one molecule

The study, which was conducted within the Cluster of Excellence 'Balance of the Microverse', shows for the first time that fungi have developed the ability to produce psilocybin at least twice independently of each other. While Psilocybe species use a known enzyme toolkit for this purpose, fiber cap mushrooms employ a completely different biochemical arsenal - and yet arrive at the same molecule. This finding is considered an example of convergent evolution: different species have independently developed a similar trait, but the 'magic mushrooms' have gone their own way in doing so.

Searching for clues in fungal genomes

Tim Schäfer, lead author of the study and doctoral researcher in Hoffmeister's team, explains: ""It was like looking at two different workshops, but both ultimately delivering the same product. In the fiber caps, we found a unique set of enzymes that have nothing to do with those found in Psilocybe mushrooms. Nevertheless, they all catalyze the steps necessary to form psilocybin.""

The researchers analyzed the enzymes in the laboratory. Protein models created by Innsbruck chemist Bernhard Rupp confirmed that the sequence of reactions differs significantly from that known in Psilocybe. ""Here, nature has actually invented the same active compound twice,"" says Schäfer.

However, why two such different groups of fungi produce the same active compound remains unclear. ""The real answer is: we don't know,"" emphasizes Hoffmeister. ""Nature does nothing without reason. So there must be an advantage to both fiber cap mushrooms in the forest and Psilocybe species on manure or wood mulch producing this molecule - we just don't know what it is yet.""

""One possible reason could be that psilocybin is intended to deter predators. Even the smallest injuries cause Psilocybe mushrooms to turn blue through a chemical chain reaction, revealing the breakdown products of psilocybin. Perhaps the molecule is a type of chemical defense mechanism,"" says Hoffmeister.

More tools for biotechnology

Although it is still unclear why different fungi ultimately produce the same molecule, the discovery nevertheless has practical implications: ""Now that we know about additional enzymes, we have more tools in our toolbox for the biotechnological production of psilocybin,"" explains Hoffmeister.

Schäfer is also looking ahead: ""We hope that our results will contribute to the future production of psilocybin for pharmaceuticals in bioreactors without the need for complex chemical syntheses."" At the Leibniz-HKI in Jena, Hoffmeister's team is working closely with the Bio Pilot Plant, which is developing processes for producing natural products such as psilocybin on an industry-like scale.

At the same time, the study provides exciting insights into the diversity of chemical strategies used by fungi and their interactions with their environment. It thus addresses central questions of the Collaborative Research Center ChemBioSys and the Cluster of Excellence ׅ'Balance of the Microverse' at Friedrich Schiller University Jena, within the framework of which the work was carried out and funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG), among others. While the CRC ChemBioSys investigates how natural compounds shape biological communities, the Cluster of Excellence focuses on the complex dynamics of microorganisms and their environment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Revolutionized Windows Laptops. Here Comes the Second Act","https://www.wired.com/story/qualcomm-snapdragon-x2-chips-2025/","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 20:30:00 GMT","

Qualcomm has announced its next generation of PC processors: the Snapdragon X2. It might not sound very exciting, but these chips continue to bring Windows laptops up to par with Apple Silicon–powered MacBooks.

The company took the PC world by storm last year with its Snapdragon X chips, breaking the long-held duopoly of Intel and AMD powering most Windows laptops. Nearly every major laptop manufacturer was on board, launching a bevy of Qualcomm-powered laptops. It was a shake-up that the Windows ecosystem needed to better compete with Apple, which began designing its own chips in 2020 with the M1 MacBook Air—a move that helped cement MacBooks as some of the best laptops around.

Qualcomm rode out its surprising success throughout 2025, and finally it's time for a sequel. The first two chips in the lineup, announced at its annual Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii, are the X2 Elite and X2 Elite Extreme, the latter of which is a new configuration in the Snapdragon X series, with the clock speed cranked up to 5 GHz. (The company paid for a portion of my travel expenses to attend the Snapdragon Summit.)

The new processors employ the third-gen Oryon CPU with up to 18 cores onboard, six more than their predecessors. Qualcomm claims that the X2 Elite Extreme gets up to 39 percent faster peak single-core performance and 50 percent multicore performance over the previous generation.

Emphasizing efficiency, Qualcomm also says the Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme has “up to 75 percent faster CPU performance than competition at ISO power,” referring to comparing two chips when they're consuming the same amount of power. As Qualcomm later specified, this comparison was with the beefy Intel Core Ultra 9 285H, requiring 144 percent more power to reach its peak performance than the Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme. Other impressive-sounding performance claims the company made include up to 49 percent faster Microsoft 365 performance (as tested in Procyon Office) and up to twice as fast file compression against the Intel Core Ultra 9 288V.

Energy efficiency was the primary advantage the initial Snapdragon X-powered laptops had over laptops that used Intel or AMD. ARM-powered processors, like those in smartphones and MacBooks, tend to be highly efficient, leading to longer battery life and better performance at lower power levels. Qualcomm says it's continuing this lead, with its new CPU requiring up to 43 percent less power versus the previous generation, across both the X2 Elite and Elite Extreme.

Perhaps the most exciting part of the chip is the graphics performance: The Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Extreme both use a new Adreno GPU architecture. Qualcomm says power efficiency has improved by 2.3X, so hopefully that means these laptops can scale up performance when it's needed, in games or creative applications. Qualcomm says gaming will take a big step forward in this next generation. Qualcomm showed a chart with 2.2X faster frame rates in Hitman World of Assassination and 2.1X faster in Black Myth Wukong. Of course, these Qualcomm laptops continue to rely exclusively on integrated graphics, meaning the discrete GPUs in dedicated gaming laptops are still on another level of performance. Snapdragon X2 chips will also support higher refresh rate screens, now up to 144 Hz and up to three external 5K monitors.

Lastly, the company claims there's a much more powerful neural processing unit (NPU) with 80 TOPS (trillions of operations per second) of on-device AI processing performance. The Snapdragon X set the initial bar with 50 TOPS, which Apple, Intel, and AMD then had to match in their next chips. We've yet to see the explosion of on-device AI processing be relevant for the average person, but hopefully, more performance will provide an incentive for developers to build more unique AI experiences that can utilize the NPU.

Qualcomm still boasts “multi-day” battery life on these new chips, though performance was the priority in the company's product presentation. This is a change from the original marketing around the first-generation Snapdragon X chips, which centered battery life as its primary selling point. At a later meeting, Kedar Kondap, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Qualcomm Compute and Gaming, told me that Snapdragon X2 laptops would maintain its position of leadership in battery life. Although exact estimates or figures weren't given, Kondap stated that the greater efficiency of the third-gen Oryon CPU would lead to even longer battery life than its predecessor.

As always, it helps to go first. These second-generation PC chips have been announced months ahead of devices from competitors, which may not arrive until the first quarter of 2026, making it easier to compare with previous-gen chips. Intel is expected to launch its highly anticipated A18 chips (also known as Panther Lake) later this year, and Nvidia's $5 billion investment in Intel could change everything in the world of PCs. Apple is also expected to debut an M5 chip next month.

Alongside new PC chips, Qualcomm also detailed its recently announced mobile chips, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. These were officially unveiled last week, but at the company's Snapdragon Summit conference, it shared new details on how these chips will perform.

Barely a week has gone by since Apple's A19-powered iPhones hit the market, but Qualcomm is already claiming that its Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is the “fastest mobile CPU in the world,” with a record clock speed of 4.6 GHz (Apple's A19 Pro has a clock speed of 4.26 GHz). Like the PC chips, graphics and AI processing have the largest leaps in performance, with a purported 23 percent faster GPU and 37 percent faster NPU. Some slightly faster single-core performance in your next phone might not be noticeable, but the significantly faster GPU could have a bigger impact on mobile gaming.

The other significant new feature on these mobile chips is the embrace of a new video codec called Advanced Professional Video, or APV. This is a “near-lossless” codec, created in partnership with Samsung, that's meant to compete with Apple's ProRes format and use less storage than current options.

Qualcomm says new phones powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 will launch ""in the coming days,” with entries from Xiaomi, OnePlus, Samsung, Honor, and Xiaomi. Qualcomm also briefly announced the base Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 but didn't offer many details about it.

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon.

During the Snapdragon Summit keynote, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon drew the biggest applause with the mention of 6G as the future connectivity standard, replacing 5G, enabling a more pervasive AI future. “6G is designed to be the connection between the cloud and edge devices,” he said.

What is 6G? In addition to increasing network speeds, Amon says, it will be a “network that is intelligent to have perception in sensor data.” Amon implies that another level of connectivity is needed for a world where AI needs to process sensor data at the edge, whether that's from your phone or a pair of smart glasses, and then be trained on that data from the real world around you. Amon says 6G will be all about “connecting the edge and the cloud, that will merge not only the physical and the digital, but also create all new experiences.”

Amon went on to predict when this change will start happening. ""We are ready to have pre-commercial devices as early as 2028. And when we get that, we're going to have context-aware intelligence at scale—and it's going to happen everywhere.” It's early days for 6G—we'll likely hear more at CES and MWC 2026—but it's worth noting that 5G was similarly hyped up years before it became the standard it is today, and it has largely failed to live up to the grand claims.

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon and Google senior VP of devices Rick Osterloh.

At the end of the keynote, we also got another tease on the merger between Chrome OS and Android, which Google briefly mentioned earlier this year. Google senior vice president of Devices and Services, Rick Osterloh, got up on stage to chat shop with Amon.

“In the past, we've always had very different systems between what we're building on PCs and what we're building on smartphones,” Osterloh said. ""We've embarked on a project to combine that. We're building together a common technical foundation on PCs and desktop computing systems.”

Osterloh mentioned Android by name, though he didn't mention Chrome OS, implying this new unified platform will still be Android at heart. “We're really excited about this, and I think this is another way Android is going to be able to serve everyone in every computing category.” Amon chimed in: “I've seen it. It's incredible. I think it delivers on the vision of convergence of mobile and PC.”

If you're building a new gaming PC, I've got a sweet deal for you on a graphics card. The PNY Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti OC (7/10, WIRED Review) is currently marked down to just $379 at Walmart. While prices have been in flux since launch, this is anywhere from $50 to $100 off the usual price, a discount that makes it a much more appealing purchase for gaming at 1080p.

PNY

Walmart

Newegg

This is the most modest entry from Nvidia's 50 Series that I think is worth your time, but that doesn't mean that you'll be disappointed. The 16-GB card can chug right along in most modern games at 1080p, beating 60 fps in every game in our test suite with the settings cranked up and the ray tracing turned on. It struggled to keep up at 1440p, at least with everything set to ultra, but a little tinkering, or Nvidia's latest tech, can help with that. Common games like Minecraft, Helldivers 2, and Marvel Rivals all ran over 90 fps, which is great news for weeknight Squirrel Girl enjoyers like myself.

As an RTX 50 Series card, the 5060 TI supports the latest version of DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) which includes Multi-Frame Generation. For every traditionally rendered frame of gameplay, the GPU can use machine learning to generate up to three extra frames with low overhead. The result is a much smoother experience, with big fps jumps each time you turn up the setting. The tradeoffs are a slight increase in input lag, as well as the occasional tiny artifact, which I feel makes this a great option for slower, cinematic games, but less optimal for twitchy shooters.

This PNY example isn't the flashiest, with a plastic housing and only two fans, but I think a lot of gamers will be satisfied with it. It does feature the classic 8-pin PCIe power plug, so it could be an upgrade for an older system too, but I don't think the performance jump would be that noticeable from the higher-end 30 or even 20 Series cards. If you want to check out your other options, I've got a full GPU buying guide that covers the latest from both AMD and Nvidia, from this card all the way up to the $2,000 RTX 5090.

In Trumpworld, Larry Ellison gets more credit than anyone else for operating in the shadows.

Over a drink earlier in Donald Trump's second term, one of the president's advisers described the Oracle cofounder, chairman, and chief technology officer to me as a literal “shadow president of the United States,” if not necessarily the shadow president.

In the months since, Ellison, who's been trading the title of “richest man alive” with Elon Musk lately, has begun to live up to the moniker. Musk is almost starting over from scratch, working his way back into Trump's good graces by seeming to pretend that whole ugly breakup and half-baked ploy to form a third party never happened. Rupert Murdoch is 94 years old and ceding more control of his media empire to his son Lachlan. Peter Thiel is running around interrogating the topic of the biblical antichrist.

As nice as it is to be a billionaire, it's even better to be one flying below most people's radar in Trump's Washington.

“He does a brilliant job of being, let's call it the anti-Elon,” a Trumpworld source in the AI industry tells me, referring to Ellison. “He's not kind of feared directly, but people in the know in Washington know he has some tremendous pull.”

With his family dynasty growing, Ellison, who at 81 is aging just as fast as anyone, could become as powerful as some combinations of those men—if he's not already there. And yet even many of my Trumpworld sources don't know much about him, in part because, as some concede, he benefits from the fundamental lack of sexiness of his business of cloud applications and databases and servers.

Given the unprecedented power and influence Ellison and his family are amassing, their lack of visibility may be about to change, no matter how much my sources in Trumpworld privately say they want more stealth from their tech billionaires in the post-Elon landscape.

In an age where human attention is perhaps the world's most valuable commodity, the Ellisons could be in charge of almost everything a modern-day pseudo robber baron could want by the end of this year or soon after. I spoke with sources who have dealt with Ellison—as well as others who know his son, David—to get a sense of how he operates. And he operates a lot lately; the Trump administration has essentially sent a fair amount of business his way after Ellison established himself as a reliable, if sparing, GOP donor and fundraiser over the 2020 and 2024 cycles.

There's his pending dominance over vertical video with a key role in the proposed new ownership consortium for the US version of TikTok, for which Oracle's servers already provide hosting. There's airwave domination, with a news and entertainment behemoth under his son's control following the merger of David's Skydance and Paramount—which might possibly include the keys to not only CBS but also CNN, if Skydance actually puts in a bid and succeeds in a potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery. The empire spans from the sweaty floor of the octagon after acquiring US broadcast rights to the Ultimate Fighting Championship (also under Paramount) all the way to the clay soil of Abilene, Texas, home of OpenAI's Stargate data center project led by Oracle and Softbank. Oracle is also linked to a $100 billion deal with Nvidia and OpenAI announced Monday.

The Ellison family is cornering the market on attention and data the way the Vanderbilts did railroads and the Rockefellers did oil.

Despite all of that, many of the president's advisers and senior aides know little to nothing about the man atop it all.

“I've never really heard anyone talk about him, tbh,” one of Trump's advisers tells me in a text message. “Not someone who really comes up all that much.”

Larry Ellison didn't used to be one of the boring Silicon Valley billionaires.

Ellison has long demonstrated a penchant for flash and a longing for the spotlight—buying 98 percent of the Hawaiian island of Lanai, attempting to acquire fighter jets from other countries, flying on unique private jets, sponsoring a yacht racing team, funding an international sailing competition, and earning a reputation decades ago as a womanizer—even if it's been diminished in Trump 2.0.

The 1997 biography The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison wastes no time answering the titular question posed by author Mike Wilson, who got extensive interview time with the future centibillionaire: “God doesn't think he's Larry Ellison.”

He may not be seen as God inside the White House, but at the very least, my Trumpworld sources tell me, Ellison isn't like most politically ambitious billionaires, even beyond his more staid business interests.

For insiders, one of the most intriguing things is that he scouts his own political talent.

“There's not a Larry political orbit like the one Elon has set up,” one Republican in Trumpworld familiar with Ellison's political activities tells me. Normally, veterans of national campaigns and Capitol Hill can earn a lot of money by giving the ultra-wealthy the lay of the land, doing almost all of the legwork shy of signing the check. “Larry,” this person says, “is very involved in calling those shots.”

A source who knows the Ellisons told me Larry began to drift away from the Democrats and toward the Republicans over the course of Barack Obama's terms in office.

“He was a big fan of Democratic politics, big fan of Bill Clinton,” the source who knows the Ellison family says. “He did a lot of fundraisers, is close to a lot of liberal politicians. And then Obama fucked up.” (Ellison gave $3 million to a pro–Mitt Romney super PAC in the 2012 cycle. He gave modestly to to the Democratic National Committee when Clinton was president, and while he hedged his bets with donations to Republicans, he was also once quoted as saying, “We should have amended the Constitution to elect Bill Clinton to a third term."")

A staunch supporter of Israel and its military, Ellison perceived Obama to be hostile to the nation, according to the source who knows the family, as the president's relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu deteriorated. (According to Haaretz, Ellison once offered Netanyahu a board seat at Oracle. Ellison denied the report. A representative for the former president declined to comment.) Early in his conservative arc, Ellison donated to a PAC supporting Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign and struck those who knew him at the time as a burgeoning moderate Republican.

“Maybe 10 years ago, he was like, ‘I want Marco Rubio to be president,'” the same source says.

Many players first started hearing of Ellison in the lead-up to the 2024 Republican presidential primary. At that point, after years of donating to both parties, Ellison was seen internally as doing Trump a small favor by pledging his financial support to senator Tim Scott, a Republican of South Carolina. My sources considered Scott to be a solid VP contender, if a slight long shot. He was seen as harmless at worst, and at best a potential insurance policy in the event of a prolonged primary campaign—a potential spoiler candidate capable of pulling support from rivals, particularly fellow South Carolinian Nikki Haley.

“His involvement with GOP politicians like Tim Scott was the appetizer,” a second Republican familiar with Ellison's political activities tells me, “and Trump is the main course.”

Ellison, who's almost two years older than Trump, has been setting the groundwork for the successor to his family empire. The weight of his legacy falls on the shoulders of his 42-year-old son, David.

Once an aspiring actor, David played a key role alongside James Franco in the 2006 WWI drama Flyboys—which he also partially financed. When his onscreen career didn't take off, he figured he would be better not just behind the camera but up in the C-suite.

David's known political donations have been entirely to Democrats. But he is not known for having the same tactical nous as Larry.

“This is the exhausting part of it,” a campaign staffer with knowledge of donor outreach involving the Ellison family tells me, describing David as someone who carried himself with the confidence of a business tycoon despite, at the point they interacted, only having been born to one. “I've dealt with a lot of people through my career who are nepo babies. Some of them feel like they're moguls in their own right.”

This source—who, like others, requested anonymity to speak candidly about the political influence of the Ellison family—said the nepo babies of the ultra wealthy tend to fall into two camps: There are those with pet policy issues and a desire to shape their legacy through some notion of making a difference, and there are those who want to accumulate power and influence for their own sake.

“He was always part of that latter group.”

Representatives for Larry and David Ellison did not return requests for comment.

While my Trumpworld and Republican sources who have dealt with Larry Ellison's political activities say they take him to be more or less a true believer on most of their key issues at this point—most notably seen in his support for the Israeli military, a focus on improving “blue cities,” and his financial interests in the AI industry—far less is known about his heir apparent.

With a still vaguely described domestic iteration of TikTok and scores of TV channels from news to entertainment coming into the family's portfolio, it remains to be seen whether David Ellison will become a Murdoch-type figure, setting the agenda for the modern GOP and in control of properties occupying the top spot in the conservative media ecosystem in the way Fox News did for the past three decades.

But with the widely rumored acquisition of the right-leaning media startup Free Press and reported interest in tapping cofounder Bari Weiss to run CBS News—and even, potentially down the line, a merger with CNN—he's already begun making Murdoch-type moves. (Weiss did not respond to a request for comment.)

“David always felt like, oh let's play both sides,” the campaign staffer who dealt with him as a donor says. “It was always a little bit like pulling teeth … to get him to engage, but he did and he did so willingly.”

“It wasn't sketchy in any way, it was very much aboveboard,” they continue. “It felt less like trying to be a good citizen and more like, ‘What's going to benefit me?'”

As for Larry, the way he has managed to cool his bad-boy image from the 1990s and find a way to be at the center of power in Trump 2.0 has certainly benefited him and put the family legacy on the strongest possible footing.

“Larry has found himself in this elder statesman role where, without saying anything, he can have a real impact,” the source who knows the Ellisons tells me. “And it looks like the strategy is working.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","A Former Apple Luminary Sets Out to Create the Ultimate GPU Software","https://www.wired.com/story/semiconductor-software-startups-chips/","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

At a certain point between building Apple's developer tools, leading a core part of Google's AI infrastructure team, and clashing with Elon Musk during a stint as Tesla's Autopilot chief, Chris Lattner's vision for his life's work started to come into focus. AI was taking over the world, and demand was growing for the chips that powered it. But the software stack for those chips was dominated by just a few big companies. Would developers be able to easily run their code across all the different chips dotting the AI landscape?

Lattner's answer to that question is Modular, a software startup he founded in 2022 with his former Google colleague Tim Davis. Modular makes a unifying software layer that helps cloud businesses squeeze as much juice as possible out of GPUs and CPUs—the high-powered chips that underpin generative AI. The startup has also built a new coding language, based on Python, that lets developers use a single language to build AI apps that run across multiple GPUs and CPUs. Modular's basic premise is that if a developer builds an app for one chip, they shouldn't have to jump through hoops in order to run it on another vendor's chip.

But Modular's long-term goal is even more ambitious: to loosen the software choke hold that companies like Nvidia and AMD have on the industry, and become the de facto software for AI chips.

“Our thesis is that the need for compute power is just exploding, but there is no unified compute platform,” Lattner says. “Sovereign AI will be everywhere. There will be many Stargates. But there will be different types of chips optimized for different use cases, and there needs to be a unified layer for that.”

There are early signs that Modular's thesis bears out. AI giants like Nvidia, AMD, and Amazon have partnered with the startup to test the waters. The GPU cluster company SF Compute also worked with Modular to build what they claim is the world's cheapest API for large AI models. As of this week, Modular's developer platform now supports Apple Silicon GPUs, in addition to Nvidia and AMD chips.

Building on this momentum, Modular just raised $250 million in venture capital funding, its third round of financing in three years, bringing its total valuation to $1.6 billion. The round was led by the Pittsburgh-based US Innovative Technology Fund. DFJ Growth also invested, along with existing investors General Catalyst, Greylock, and GV (formerly known as Google Ventures).

“We've spent a bunch of time and energy trying to figure out what makes a startup in this space interesting, and with every company that has tried to build their own chip—and even the big players, like AMD and Nvidia—it all comes back to the software,” says Dave Munichiello, managing partner at GV. “Chris convinced me that the software was the most interesting and valuable problem to address.”

It might be valuable—but it's also extremely complicated. Part of that complication stems from Nvidia's closed ecosystem. Nvidia's chips make up the vast majority of the GPU market, but the company's 20-year-old proprietary software platform, CUDA, keeps developers locked in. AMD's software platform for high-performance computing, called ROCm, differs in that it's open source. This allows developers to more easily move code to different chips.

Still, developers say that bringing code from Nvidia's CUDA to ROCm isn't a smooth process, which means they typically focus on building for just one chip vendor.

“ROCm is amazing, it's open source, but it runs on one vendor's hardware,” Lattner told the crowd at AMD's Advancing AI event in June. Then he made his pitch for why Modular's software is more portable and makes GPUs that much faster.

Lattner's talk at AMD is representative of the kind of dance that Lattner and Davis need to do as they spread the Modular gospel. Today, Nvidia and AMD are both crucial partners for the firm. In a future universe, they're also direct competitors. Part of Modular's value proposition is that it can ship software for optimizing GPUs even faster than Nvidia, as there might be a months-long gap between when Nvidia ships a new GPU and when it releases an “attention kernel”—a critical part of the GPU software.

“Right now Modular is complimentary to AMD and Nvidia, but over time you could see both of those companies feeling threatened by ROCm or CUDA not being the best software that sits on top of their chips,” says Munichiello. He also worries that potential cloud customers may balk at having to pay for an additional software layer like Modular's.

Writing software for GPUs is also something of a “dark art,” says Waleed Atallah, the cofounder and CEO of Mako, a GPU kernel optimization company. “Mapping an algorithm to a GPU is an insanely difficult thing to do. There are a hundred million software devs, 10,000 who write GPU kernels, and maybe a hundred who can do it well.”

Mako is building AI agents to optimize coding for GPUs. Some developers think that's the future for the industry, rather than building a universal compiler or a new programming language like Modular. Mako just raised $8.5 million in seed funding from Flybridge Capital and the startup accelerator Neo.

“We're trying to take an iterative approach to coding and automate it with AI,” Atallah says. “By making it easier to write the code, you exponentially grow the number of people who can do that. Making another compiler is more of a fixed solution.”

Lattner notes that Modular also uses AI coding tools. But the company is intent on addressing the whole coding stack, not just kernels.

There are roughly 250 million reasons why investors think this approach is viable. Lattner is something of a luminary in the coding world, having previously built the open source compiler infrastructure project LLVM, as well as Apple's Swift programming language. He and Davis are both convinced that this is a software problem that must be solved outside of a Big Tech environment, where most companies focus on building software for their own technology stack.

""When I left Google I was a little bit depressed, because I really wanted to solve this,” Lattner says. “What we realized is that it's not about smart people, it's not about money, it's not about capability. It's a structural problem.”

Munichiello shared a mantra common in the tech investing world: He says he's betting on the founders themselves as much as their product. “He's highly opinionated and impatient, and also right a lot of the time,” Munichiello said of Lattner. “Steve Jobs was also like that—he didn't make decisions based on consensus, but he was often right.”

A new app offering to record your phone calls and pay you for the audio so it can sell the data to AI companies is, unbelievably, the No. 2 app in Apple's U.S. App Store's Social Networking section. 

The app, Neon Mobile, pitches itself as a moneymaking tool offering “hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year” for access to your audio conversations.

Neon's website says the company pays 30¢ per minute when you call other Neon users and up to $30 per day maximum for making calls to anyone else. The app also pays for referrals. The app first ranked No. 476 in the Social Networking category of the U.S. App Store on September 18 but jumped to No. 10 at the end of yesterday, according to data from app intelligence firm Appfigures.

On Wednesday, Neon was spotted in the No. 2 position on the iPhone's top free charts for social apps.

Neon also became the No. 7 top overall app or game earlier on Wednesday morning and became the No. 6 top app.

According to Neon's terms of service, the company's mobile app can capture users' inbound and outbound phone calls. However, Neon's marketing claims to only record your side of the call unless it's with another Neon user.

That data is being sold to “AI companies,” Neon's terms of service state, “for the purpose of developing, training, testing, and improving machine learning models, artificial intelligence tools and systems, and related technologies.”

The fact that such an app exists and is permitted on the app stores is an indication of how far AI has encroached into users' lives and areas once thought of as private. Its high ranking within the Apple App Store, meanwhile, is proof that there is now some subsection of the market seemingly willing to exchange their privacy for pennies, regardless of the larger cost to themselves or society.

Despite what Neon's privacy policy says, its terms include a very broad license to its user data, where Neon grants itself a:

…worldwide, exclusive, irrevocable, transferable, royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to sell, use, host, store, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform (including by means of a digital audio transmission), communicate to the public, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, create derivative works as authorized in these Terms, and distribute your Recordings, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels, in each instance whether now known or hereafter developed.

That leaves plenty of wiggle room for Neon to do more with users' data than it claims. 

The terms also include an extensive section on beta features, which have no warranty and may have all sorts of issues and bugs.

Though Neon's app raises many red flags, it may be technically legal. 

“Recording only one side of the phone call is aimed at avoiding wiretap laws,” Jennifer Daniels, a partner with the law firm Blank Rome‘s Privacy, Security & Data Protection Group, tells TechCrunch.

“Under [the] laws of many states, you have to have consent from both parties to a conversation in order to record it … It's an interesting approach,” says Daniels.

Peter Jackson, cybersecurity and privacy attorney at Greenberg Glusker, agreed — and tells TechCrunch that the language around “one-sided transcripts” sounds like it could be a backdoor way of saying that Neon records users' calls in their entirety but may just remove what the other party said from the final transcript.

In addition, the legal experts pointed to concerns about how anonymized the data may really be. 

Neon claims it removes users' names, emails, and phone numbers before selling data to AI companies. But the company doesn't say how AI partners or others it sells to could use that data. Voice data could be used to make fake calls that sound like they're coming from you, or AI companies could use your voice to make their own AI voices.

“Once your voice is over there, it can be used for fraud,” says Jackson. “Now this company has your phone number and essentially enough information — they have recordings of your voice, which could be used to create an impersonation of you and do all sorts of fraud.”

Even if the company itself is trustworthy, Neon doesn't disclose who its trusted partners are or what those entities are allowed to do with users' data further down the road. Neon is also subject to potential data breaches, as any company with valuable data may be.

In a brief test by TechCrunch, Neon did not offer any indication that it was recording the user's call, nor did it warn the call recipient. The app worked like any other voice-over-IP app, and the caller ID displayed the inbound phone number, as usual. (We'll leave it to security researchers to attempt to verify the app's other claims.)

Neon founder Alex Kiam didn't return a request for comment.

Kiam, who is identified only as “Alex” on the company website, operates Neon from a New York apartment, a business filing shows.

A LinkedIn post indicates Kiam raised money from Upfront Ventures a few months ago for his startup, but the investor didn't respond to an inquiry from TechCrunch as of the time of writing.

There was a time when companies looking to profit from data collection through mobile apps handled this type of thing on the sly. 

When it was revealed in 2019 that Facebook was paying teens to install an app that spies on them, it was a scandal. The following year, headlines buzzed again when it was discovered that app store analytics providers operated dozens of seemingly innocuous apps to collect usage data about the mobile app ecosystem. There are regular warnings to be wary of VPN apps, which often aren't as private as they claim. There are even government reports detailing how agencies regularly purchase personal data that's “commercially available” on the market.

Now AI agents regularly join meetings to take notes, and always-on AI devices are on the market. But at least in those cases, everyone is consenting to a recording, Daniels tells TechCrunch.

In light of this widespread usage and sale of personal data, there are likely now those cynical enough to think that if their data is being sold anyway, they may as well profit from it. 

Unfortunately, they may be sharing more information than they realize and putting others' privacy at risk when they do. 

“There is a tremendous desire on the part of, certainly, knowledge workers — and frankly, everybody — to make it as easy as possible to do your job,” says Jackson. “And some of these productivity tools do that at the expense of, obviously, your privacy, but also, increasingly, the privacy of those with whom you are interacting on a day-to-day basis.”

For decades, Silicon Valley has valorized the college dropout. Founders like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg left school early to build companies and became billionaires. 

That ethos was later institutionalized through initiatives like the Thiel Fellowship, which famously pays promising students $100,000 to leave college and start companies.

For many years, the famed accelerator Y Combinator also quietly reinforced that culture. While it never explicitly required students to drop out, many of its most successful alumni, including Dropbox's Drew Houston, Reddit's Steve Huffman, and Stripe's John and Patrick Collison, joined the program young and left school behind to build their companies.

Now, YC is changing that narrative.

The accelerator has introduced a new application track called Early Decision, designed for students who want to start companies but don't want to drop out. The program allows them to apply while still in school, get accepted and funded immediately, and defer their participation in YC until after they graduate. For example, a student applying in Fall 2025 could graduate in Spring 2026, then participate in YC's Summer 2026 batch.

“It's designed for graduating seniors who want to do a startup but also want to finish school first,” said YC managing partner Jared Friedman in the launch video. 

Friedman added that the idea for Early Decision came from conversations with students. “Between AI Startup School last summer and the more than 20 university trips we've done over the past year, we've had a lot of opportunities to do that. One of YC's most common pieces of advice is to ‘talk to your users,' and we follow it ourselves,” he told TechCrunch over email. 

In Silicon Valley culture, dropping out has been almost a rite of passage for aspiring founders Programs like the Thiel Fellowship have turned it into a movement (though it's worth noting that Peter Thiel himself did not drop out but earned both undergraduate and law degrees from Stanford). 

It's why YC's announcement is a meaningful break from that mythos that leaving school early is the optimal, or only, path to startup success. The timing is also significant, coming at a time when more young people are questioning both the cost of college and the tradeoffs of staying in school. 

The new program also reflects a growing maturity in how YC thinks about long-term founder outcomes.

The accelerator has long been a magnet for college-aged builders. Founders of Loom, Instacart, Rappi, and Brex were in their teens or early twenties when they joined the program. But the decision to drop out was often implicit: do the program now or miss the opportunity.

Early Decision removes that pressure, offering a middle ground between academic completion and chasing entrepreneurship. The move could broaden YC's applicant pool to include more cautious, deliberate student founders who are committed to startup life but unwilling to sacrifice education to get there.

Introducing Early Decision.For students who want to do a startup but also want to finish school first. Apply now, get funded the moment you're accepted, and do YC after you graduate.https://t.co/YQbvZj0AJm pic.twitter.com/AN1iMm9k9j

In its announcement, YC highlights Sneha Sivakumar and Anushka Nijhawan, the co-founders of Spur, as a success story from this approach. Spur builds AI-powered quality-assurance testing tools, and the duo applied to YC through Early Decision in Fall 2023 while still in school. They graduated in May 2024, joined the Summer 2024 YC batch and have since raised $4.5 million. 

YC notes that the program is open to both graduating students and those earlier in their academic journey. It's a bet that some of the best founders of the next decade won't need to choose between college and startups. They'll do both. 

The move also helps YC secure talent early in an increasingly competitive accelerator and seed funding landscape, giving students an option that competes with other programs like Thiel Fellowship, Neo Scholars, Founders Inc, as well as Big Tech internships and grad school pipelines.

Posted:

The Trump administration last Friday announced a new $100,000 annual levy on H-1B visas, which allow 85,000 skilled foreign workers to enter the U.S. each year. The fee applies to companies hiring these workers, primarily in tech.

Veteran venture capitalist Michael Moritz isn't having it. In a new, scathing Financial Times op-ed, the former Sequoia Capital honcho compares the White House to Tony Soprano's pork store, calling the move another “brutish extortion scheme.”

Moritz argues that Trump fundamentally misunderstands why tech companies hire foreign workers, saying it's about skills and filling labor shortages, not replacing Americans or cutting costs. The policy will backfire, he warns, by pushing companies to relocate work to Istanbul, Warsaw, or Bangalore instead of keeping it stateside.

“Engineers with undergraduate degrees from the better eastern Europe, Turkish and Indian universities are every bit as well qualified as their American counterparts,” Moritz writes.

Instead of restricting H-1B visas, Moritz suggests doubling or tripling them, or automatically granting citizenship to foreign nationals earning STEM PhDs from top U.S. universities. He points to foreign-born CEOs like Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Google's Sundar Pichai as examples of H-1B program success. (Elon Musk and Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger are two others.)

Moritz himself received the precursor visa to the H-1B in 1979, and ever since, writes the billionaire, “I have felt grateful to the country that welcomed me.”

An Indian court has dismissed an attempt by Elon Musk's X to challenge the Indian government's content takedown orders, ruling that the social media platform, as a foreign company, does not have a constitutional right to free speech under Indian law.

The Karnataka High Court ruled Wednesday in favor of the Indian government's use of a centralized online portal to issue content takedown orders, determining that foreign platforms cannot invoke free speech protections under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution. The court said this constitutional of free expression applies only to Indian citizens. The decision marks a significant moment in India's increasingly assertive approach to regulating global tech companies.

X filed the case in March, challenging a series of Indian government orders directing the platform to block certain accounts and posts, including content critical of official policies. At the heart of the dispute was the use of “Sahyog” — a government portal launched in October that allows authorities to directly order social media companies to remove content. Sahyog means “assistance” in Hindi. X called it a “censorship portal” and argued the process lacked transparency and violated principles of free expression.

“Article 19 of the Constitution of India, noble in its spirit and luminous in its promise, remains, nevertheless, a Charter of Rights conferred upon citizens only. The petitioner who seeks sanctuary under its canopy must be a citizen of the nation, failing which the protective embrace of Article 19 cannot be invoked,” senior judge M Nagaprasanna said in his ruling, which was also livestreamed, as the court rejected X's petition.

The ruling comes as Musk expands his footprint in India beyond X, having recently launched Tesla operations and secured final regulatory approval for his satellite internet service Starlink. The South Asian nation is a strategic bet for the billionaire, boasting the world's second-largest internet user base after China and a government committed to achieving 30% electric vehicle adoption by 2030.

X did not respond to a request for comments. A legal representative for X in India was not immediately available to comment on the ruling.

Kazim Rizvi, Founding Director of The Dialogue, a New Delhi-based think tank, said the ruling may improve coordination between the government and platforms, but cautioned that “due diligence” should not become a blanket obligation to comply — especially when takedowns occur via a portal, rather than through the structured safeguards of Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000. (Section 69A is India's main law governing how the government can order content blocking, and it includes procedural protections.)

“To avoid unintended legal effects, the portal should operate strictly as a coordination and collection layer — a secure intake and routing point for requests, and any binding action should originate from a competent authority under the IT Act/Rules,” he told TechCrunch.

Content takedown orders have increased in India over the past few years as more people come online. Several instances of content removal across platforms — including X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram — occurred during the nationwide farmers' protests in 2020–2021. These protests saw widespread social media activity that the government sought to control.

The federal government introduced the Sahyog portal last year to expedite the removal of unlawful content from social media, arguing that it would streamline enforcement. Companies, including Microsoft, Google, Meta, ShareChat, and LinkedIn, have already integrated the portal to remove content after receiving notices through an automated process triggered by the federal government or its agencies.

In February 2024, X stated that, although it disagreed with the orders, it withheld certain accounts in response to executive directives from the Indian government. Noncompliance, the company noted, could have exposed it to “potential penalties including significant fines and imprisonment.”

A legal expert, who works closely with tech companies and the Indian government on policy matters and requested anonymity due to the sensitive nature of their work, told TechCrunch that Wednesday's ruling was significant. The decision shows that courts are increasingly viewing internet regulation and tech policy through a policy lens — not just a legal one, they said.

Musk, who has called himself a “free speech absolutist,” has not commented on the lawsuit and ruling, though he previously raised concerns about Indian content regulation laws.

“The rules in India for what can appear on social media are quite strict, and we can't go beyond the laws of a country,” Musk said in a 2023 interview with the BBC.

X can still appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. However, some legal experts argue that it is unclear whether the company would receive favorable treatment, as the top court is likely to follow the same line of reasoning as the Karnataka High Court.

“The ruling didn't address whether the government should even have the power to use a portal for ordering content takedowns,” said a tech policy expert, who requested not to be named due to their close ties with the Indian government and major tech firms.

The court will release the order's copy on Thursday, the judge said.

The commercial incentive Match Group has to prevent churn means the optimal outcome for them is that you never find a partner. And so if you're outside that top N percentile of popularity, they've optimized their apps to abuse you emotionally and financially. They're engineering the perfect carrot on a stick.One such behaviour, for example, is that when you buy Tinder Plus, they will feed you a couple matches, but withhold more than they give you. Once the subscription expires, they feed you rest of the “Likes You” people into the page where they're obscured, forcing you to resubscribe if you want to see them. And of course you will never encounter those people just by swiping, they're purposefully held from you.I've recently switched to Facebook Dating because they don't have any commercial incentives (and in fact probably negative incentives) to NOT match you. Thus they can also give you all of the “Premium” features for free.What Match Group is doing probably isn't illegal, but I think it probably should be. It's the same kind of emotional manipulation that casinos are guilty of.

A FOSS or nationalized dating app would still result in:1. The feeling of FOMO (99% of swipers stop swiping before they find their REAL soulmate for real this time)2. Impersonality. One cannot effectively communicate that they are generous, kind, and funny or any other set of attractive but abstract qualities in 4 photos and a short bio.4. Similar to impersonality, is the loss of contextual bonding. Especially for women, being in proximity to a potential mate tends to work a lot better than seeing a few 2D photos. It's crazy to think about, but a huge percentage of happy long-lasting couples who met organically would have never swiped on each other, me being one example.5. Asymmetrical supply and demand (women dying of thirst in the ocean while men die of thirst in the desert)6. The 'stranger' dynamic makes everything low-stakes and therefore low effort. There is no social consequence for bad behaviour, whereas if you met someone at work, school, church, or were introduced by a mutual friend, there IS a social cost for ghosting, manipulation, superficiality, etc.7. All of the above results in WAY too many interactions in a romantic or potentially romantic context, and I don't think people were meant to have dozens of situationships for a decade before finally getting success. The constant churn and burn cycle results in burnout. The burnout is exhausting and discouraging and worse, can lead to feelings of antipathy.None of the above is actually solved by a different ownership or funding model. I'm sure that building an app in such a way that artificially gatekeeping a superior experience behind a subscription creates its own set of winners and losers, but I don't think that is actually in people's top complaints about the dating app experience!

Due to the ""sales numbers game"" of online dating, there's an incentive to keep your pipeline full, lest one of your deals falls through and you have to start all over.

That's why you need the original founders to make it again. OkCupid was a site made by 140 IQ dudes in Boston for 100+ IQ types. It was not an easy problem. It succeeded because the match % was uncannily accurate. Loss of the site (acquisition and tinderification by Match) was like the sack of Rome.

That said, I think the world has changed in ways that would make it difficult to replicate now.  For one thing, imagine all the AI bot profiles that would exist.  For another, the legal environment has only gotten worse in the sense that entities like Match will try to sue you for infringing on some bogus patent.Also, let's not forget that the takeover by Match was a deliberate choice: those ""140 IQ dudes"" chose to sell out their nice product to a big evil company although it was pretty foreseeable they were going to ruin it.  Who's to say that wouldn't happen again?

What should be illegal? Withholding matches when you're paid to keep you single but showing you more attractive matches after you unsubscribe? Listen to yourself.

They may for some time but making a product purposely bad and hostile to your user base doesn't lead to long term growth and people will abandon the product for alternatives.Not everything ""bad"" needs to be illegal.

In a sane market, those dark patterns would be defeated by competition, but there is a distressing lack of sane markets today. Everything is consolidating, and there seems to be zero momentum in the opposite direction. So in the face of these market failures, legislation to combat the low hanging fruit like this is probably the only way to make life for consumers bearable without actually fixing the underlying issues.

reply

I'm sure this will draw immediate reactions that in a heavily lobbied (i.e., bribed) environment, it's a pipe dream to hope for antitrust action to occur, but I would point out that the very same environment isn't any more likely to impose meaningful regulation, either.

reply

I tend to think that makes things less bearable in the long term, though, precisely because it doesn't fix the underlying issues.  It's like just taking a bunch of ibuprofen and walking on a badly injured leg.  It may make it hurt less but it can also make the problem worse.  We may need to let the pain get intense enough that people feel no alternative but to overhaul the whole system.

Rape is underreported because this attitude is so prevalent. Reporting a rape is incredibly difficult and traumatizing and rarely leads to a conviction. It also exposes you to violence and harassment to the person who raped you in the first place.

Putting yourself in a vulnerable position with a person you only have met online without someone trustworthy vouching for them is inherently unwise. Meeting trough friends/collogues has a bit more safety guardrails.

Since 2018, Insomniac Games has built out a solid series of Spider-Man games headlined by Peter Parker and Miles Morales. It was only a few years ago the studio revealed it was aiming to give Wolverine the same treatment, but it's been quiet on the project since then—and that silence was further exacerbated with 2023's hack.

But at today's State of Play event, the studio rolled up with a first true look at the game. Players will take on the role of Logan (played by Liam McIntyre) as he travels the globe (including the Canadian wilderness, Tokyo, and Madripoor), fighting the Reavers and crossing paths with some familiar faces like Omega Red and Mystique. Where the Spider-Man games have emphasized those characters' agility, Insomniac's take on Logan is all about his brute strength and animal instincts, not to mention those sharp claws of his. And boy, are things gonna get bloody.

Following the trailer, Insomniac talked up the Wolverine game in a behind-the scenes video you can see below. Creative director Marcus Smith teased the title will deal with the memory problems that've defined the character. He'll be an “unreliable narrator” throughout the adventure and “stay true to [the character's] experience” while still providing Insomniac's own distinct spin on the X-hero.

Marvel's Wolverine hits the PlayStation 5 in fall 2026. Insomniac plans to show more on the action-adventure title in the spring.

Few blockbuster franchises inspire as much debate and discourse as Star Wars, and it's also the rare series that invites not just fans and critics to speak out, but also the people who have starred in its shows and movies. John Boyega, who played Finn across the sequel trilogy, hasn't been shy about holding back, whether it's his opinions on “Reylo” or how the fandom treats Star Wars‘ Black characters, to name two recent topics.

And though The Rise of Skywalker hit theaters in 2019, it feels like people are still constantly asking Boyega to talk about Star Wars. The most recent example came at the recent Florida Supercon. The event was held back in July, but as Variety reports (via Popverse), his comments are now going widespread, likely because Boyega seemingly unloaded on how he would've approached the Lucasfilm sequel series a lot differently.

“If I was a producer on Star Wars from the beginning, you would have had a whole completely different thing … we're not getting rid of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, all these people. We're not doing that. The first thing we're going to do is fulfill their story, fulfill their legacy. We're going to make a good moment of handing on the baton,” he said during a Supercon panel.

He also noted, referring to a certain Force-powered final battle, “Luke Skywalker wouldn't be disappearing on a rock. Hell no. Standing there and he's, like, a projector? I would want to give those characters way more.”

He also had some ideas about how the new Star Wars characters should have approached their own Force powers. “Our new characters will not be OP'd [overpowered] in these movies. They won't just grab stuff and know what to do with it. No. You've got to struggle like every other character in this franchise. I'd do that.”

Interestingly, however, the sources Boyega said he would have drawn from don't exactly stay true to that.

“I'd look to the Old Republic stories and see what we can add to the continuation of that. I would definitely want to see Force Unleashed stories in there,” Boyega explained, calling out a video game that features overpowered characters—as well as one like The Force Unleashed that's specifically non-canon, which makes the rest of his statement even odder: “I would try to expand the Star Wars universe as much as possible while respecting the lore. If we're expanding the lore, we have to do it within the respective boundaries that stay true.”

Obviously Boyega is just spitballing here, responding to a fan question and sharing his own off-the-cuff thoughts. Even if we don't quite follow his logic, we love to see that he's still got so much passion for Star Wars. And while Han Solo and Luke Skywalker are definitely gone, we may yet see Finn again, if that Rey movie ever comes into being.

Google's getting in on PCs, and it could mean we'll finally have another option beyond today's stable of operating systems. After letting ChromeOS moulder in a sea of its own inadequacies, the tech giant confirmed it's going to offer a true PC operating system alternative to macOS or Windows 11 sometime… eventually. At Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit (full disclosure: travel and lodging were paid by Qualcomm, and Gizmodo did not guarantee any coverage as a condition of accepting the trip), Google VP of Devices and Services Rick Osterloh spoke with Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon and hinted about this new phase of Android.

“I've seen it, it's incredible,” quipped Amon. With no other hints to go on, we need to consider what Google needs to do to make Android work on a big screen. Android on desktops or laptops needs to offer more than an Android-ified version of the latest iPadOS 26. Google could offer an OS that allows for the Mac-style continuity between devices without the walled garden that limits you to apps dictated by Google. I'm one of those PC users routinely miffed that Windows is force-feeding Microsoft's first-party apps like OneDrive down our throats with annoying popup ads on desktop. A change of scenery would be welcome, but I'm not one ready to abandon my Steam library, either.

For those curious, here's Osterloh's full comments about Google's plans for Android on PC:

“In the past, we've always had very different systems between what we're building on PCs and what we're building in smartphones and we've embarked on a project to combine that. We're building together a common technical foundation for our products on PCs and desktop computers, and I think this is another way that we can leverage all of the great work we're doing together on our AI stack bringing Gemini models—bringing all of our application and developer community into the PC domain. So we're really excited about this and I think this is another way in which Android is going to be able to serve everyone in every computing category.”

Without specifics, we can only guesstimate what form Android on PC could take. Of course, Google is going to fill its new OS to the brim with Gemini AI features. On Chromebook, this is in the form of Gemini and apps like NotebookLM accessible straight from the taskbar. Google would likely want to utilize the desktop space to stick Gemini directly into the main UI, akin to Microsoft shoving Copilot on the Windows 11 desktop. Already, Google apps like Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more all contain a button that lets Gemini access your files. Sometimes this proves useful. AI is great for quickly filling out spreadsheets. In other ways, the AI can be idiotic. I can ask Gemini to find an email about an upcoming event for a company coming up in October, and it will tell me about an email from last year.

Using AI to its fullest requires retraining users' expectations. That's already a hard bargain when desktop or laptop users are used to the standard experience on macOS, Windows—and to a smaller degree—Linux. Android was born as a modified version of a Linux kernel. After so many years, the Android Open Source Project has taken on a life of its own and now rules as the bedrock for all mobile devices that aren't part of Apple's steadfast iOS domain. Android's best option to muscle in on the PC space is to simply regress back to its Linux roots.

Nobody wants to be beholden to an app store. Google has continued to argue in court that sideloading and third-party app stores ruin the experience. Judges haven't bought that line of thinking, and neither have users. There's nothing bad about having full native access to all Android apps, but they need to work well on a larger display. Beyond that, users expect to download all their main productivity and gaming apps. Compatibility is what's been holding back Qualcomm's own ARM-based Snapdragon X-based PCs with Windows 11. Google would be better off ensuring users can access all the Linux versions of the most-popular apps than letting them load the mobile version of TikTok.

ChromeOS is dead simple. It borrows the Windows taskbar and enables a spare few features from the control center or through the Quick Access key on recent Chromebook Plus models. File management can feel like a chore. Tasks as simple as cropping photos to specific sizes aren't simple on Chromebook's default apps. A desktop OS requires a completely different frame of mind from what Google has done recently.

PC users want something clean, straightforward, and easy to manage. We don't need the ostentation of Material 3 Expressive. We want to use all our current peripherals and external displays and change our settings to suit our needs. A new OS would need to facilitate users changing out components for their desktops or more customizable laptops. It sure seems like Google has its eye on Qualcomm's PC chips to start. Still, this can't be a one-and-done venture. Google, always in mind to take a hatchet to well-established features or apps (remember Stadia game streaming? I sure do) would need to support this new venture long-term. Compared to ChromeOS, this new software suite shouldn't be beholden to streaming through the Chrome browser.

Qualcomm is back for round two of its push into Windows PCs. At its Snapdragon Summit in Maui, Hawaii, the company revealed its Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Extreme. These chips will serve as the high-end offerings in Qualcomm's second generation of Arm-based chips for laptops and other PC form factors.

The Elite Extreme is a new tier above the standard Elite, which was the top chip in the original X-series line. The Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme will offer up to 18 cores, and Qualcomm claims it's the first Arm chip to hit 5 GHz (on up to two cores).

The company says its Elite chips will be made on a 3-nanometer process node. The Snapdragon X2 Elite uses a mix of Qualcomm Oryon Prime cores and what it calls Performance CPU cores. This is seemingly a standard Performance/Efficiency layout with different names. At normalized power, Qualcomm says it offers up to 75% more performance than its competitors. In multitasking, it claims the new chips will offer up to 31% faster performance at a normalized ISO power, while needing 43% less power than last-gen chips. We don't yet have benchmarks to share, and Qualcomm didn't note the exact TDPs for these chips.

 




The Elite Extreme has higher clock speeds in both single- and dual-core boost and multi-core max than the other two Snapdragon X2 Elite variants. The Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme is model X2E-96-100, while the standard Elites are X2E-88-100 and X2E-80-100. The Extreme and the 88-100 each have 18 cores, while the 80-100 has 12 cores.

There's also a new Qualcomm Adreno GPU, which the company says brings a 2.3x increase in performance per watt and power efficiency compared to the last generation. The new 80 TOPS NPU looks to be the fastest in a laptop (with INT8 math), with 78% more TOPS than the previous generation, 45 TOPS NPU. In its press release, Qualcomm writes that this NPU ""is designed to handle Copilot+ and concurrent AI experiences."" (Copilot+ doesn't include actual Copilot, the assistant that runs largely in the cloud.)

The X2 Elite chip supports Qualcomm's x75 5G modem-RG system, with up to 10 Gbps peak downloads. It also works with Qualcomm FastConnect 7800 for Wi-FI 7/6/6E and Bluetooth 5.4 LE. Qualcomm's new Guardian is an out-of-band management feature for business-focused remote oversight, akin to Intel's vPro.

Qualcomm says that it expects systems with the X2 Elite to ship in the first half of 2026. That may mean we'll see a device or two at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, before launch. Notably, Qualcomm's images and a sizzle reel both suggest that the X2 Elite will appear in both laptops and mini PCs.

It's been over a year since the initial batch of Snapdragon X Elite chips were announced. Subsequently, a full lineup including the X Plus (in both 10-core and 8-core variants) and a standard Snapdragon X chip were released. The top-end chips appeared in designs from major manufacturers, including Microsoft, Samsung, Dell, HP, Asus, Lenovo, and Acer.

The initial chips showed off their efficiency through long battery life, and we hope to see the X2 SoCs build on that. They didn't, however, work with some applications (namely games) and we want to see better emulation support there. Windows on Arm, however, didn't exactly take over the market, so we'll see what the new chips bring to the table.

Qualcomm is announcing these chips pretty early. The Snapdragon Summit comes ahead of Apple's next major release (Apple is Qualcomm's biggest rival in Arm-based systems), which is rumored to be early next year. And of course, by the time many X2 devices make it to market in the first half of 2026, AMD and Intel may also have next-gen x86 chips ready to compete.

Next year is shaping up to be an eventful one for those looking to buy a new laptop, which should be good for consumers and the industry as a whole. After a fairly quiet 2025 on the mobile front, it'll also be nice to have some fresh silicon to test.

Embedded liquid cooling.

As data center-grade processors are getting hotter, companies invent more and more creative ways to cool them down. As Nvidia and its partners are reportedly experimenting with new cold plates and immersion cooling for next-generation AI GPUs, Microsoft is proposing to etch microfluidic channels on the back of an actual chip to reduce its peak temperature by up to 65%, making it three times more efficient than cold plates.

Microsoft says it has developed a cooling system that routes fluid directly into microchannels etched on the back of the silicon die to guide the coolant to high-heat regions inside the chip. Flowing liquid inside the chip greatly reduces the efficiency of the whole setup, as liquid can almost 'touch' hot spots inside the processor, whereas in the case of more traditional liquid cooling or even immersion cooling, heat emerges several layers away from the coolant.

To optimize thermal routing, Microsoft worked with Swiss startup Corintis, which used artificial intelligence to refine channel geometry. Rather than simple straight lines, the final layout mimics patterns found in nature, such as leaf veins or butterfly wings, to guide fluid more efficiently. Also, microchannels must be small enough to function effectively but not so deep that they weaken the silicon, risking mechanical failure.

However, etching microfluid channels can only be done as a separate sequence during chip manufacturing, which means additional steps and costs. Alternatively, Microsoft proposes to produce a microfluidic heat transfer structure separately and cool down one or two chips using the structure, according to a patent. Such integration requires new packaging methods to prevent coolant leaks and maintain durability.

By now, Microsoft has discovered the right coolant fluid, developed precise etching techniques, and managed to integrate these into chip production. Therefore, Microsoft considers its technology ready for full-scale production within Microsoft's chip development pipeline. Third-party customers may license the technology from Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC.

""Microfluidics would allow for more power-dense designs that will enable more features that customers care about and give better performance in a smaller amount of space,"" said Judy Priest, corporate vice president and chief technical officer of Cloud Operations and Innovation at Microsoft. ""But we needed to prove the technology and the design worked, and then the very next thing I wanted to do was test reliability.""

Microsoft is testing the cooling solution on servers running simulated Teams workloads, where uneven heat loads across many services are handled more efficiently, enabling higher burst performance, which helps to reduce the number of servers that otherwise sit idle when not in use during peak loads that tend to happen on the hour or on the half-hour.

Lab tests showed that this new technique can reduce peak silicon temperatures by up to 65%, depending on the specific chip and usage. Compared to cold plates, the cooling performance improvement was as much as three times, depending on workload and setup. The method also enables cooling without relying on ultra-low coolant temperatures, saving energy otherwise needed for chilling, Microsoft noted.

Microsoft has been experimenting with its microfluidic channels liquid cooling technology for years and demonstrated the first prototype in 2022, so by now, the company has plenty of lab experience with the technology. Yet, Microsoft is not the only company to develop methods to produce embedded coolant channels inside a chip or chip package. IBM also has appropriate patents.

This partnership comes despite Beijing's directive to stop purchasing Nvidia's H20 and RTX Pro 6000D chips.

Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba announced that it's partnering with Nvidia to fuel its data center expansion across the globe and the introduction of new AI products. Reuters reports that the company is now prioritizing artificial intelligence as part of its core business, which will put it on par with the company's online retail and wholesale business that made it the tech giant it is today. The announcement seems to imply a direct contravention of Beijing's directive that bans its biggest tech companies from acquiring Nvidia chips, so it's unclear if this partnership includes the purchase of AI GPUs.According to Alibaba Cloud, the company's Platform for AI (PAI) will integrate the “full suite of the Nvidia Physical AI software stack,"" so it technically may not violate the order to buy homegrown AI processors. The company already reportedly has its AI chip that competes with Nvidia's own H20, and it has even created its own High Performance Network using Ethernet to replace Nvidia's interconnect technology.However, it seems that Alibaba is ready to work with Nvidia to create a cloud-based system design to advance AI capabilities in real-world applications. “The speed of AI industry development has far exceeded our expectations, and the industry's demand for AI infrastructure has also far exceeded our expectations,” said Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu during the annual Aspara Conference. Alibaba also unveiled plans to build data centers in Brazil, France, and the Netherlands in the coming year. It will also add more of the same in Mexico, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, and Dubai — also in the coming year. Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group SVP Dr. Feifei Li remarked that “AI is revolutionizing not only technology, but also the very foundation of how enterprises deliver business value and drive growth. Our strategic expansion of global infrastructure is designed to cater for the accelerating demand from forward-thinking customers.” But despite all these plans, the company did not mention whether it will use Nvidia's AI chips for these projects. This move to increase Alibaba's footprint abroad will help the company influence the development of AI technology across the globe. It might even be the start of what Jensen Huang has been warning about — that the limitation of the sales of Nvidia chips will allow its competitors to gain a foothold in the international market and reduce the U.S.'s competitive advantage. Of course, its software partnership with Alibaba helps ensure that Nvidia is still involved with this massive project — unless Washington, D.C. or Beijing steps in as part of their chip rivalry and stops the deal from moving forward.

 September 24, 2025  

The first time Anna Shapiro, MD, professor of radiation oncology at SUNY Upstate University Hospital in Syracuse, New York, treated osteoarthritis with low-dose radiation, a retired physician had come to her with a stack of research requesting it.

“He had limited use of his thumb from arthritis in his joint, and he came to me with literature and said, ‘Would you do this for me?'” she told Medscape Medical News. She had already read some of that research herself, including the protocol, and she agreed. “He did very well. He kept moving his hand, [saying], ‘I can use my hands.' He was so happy.”

The experience led Shapiro to learn even more about the treatment option, even traveling to Germany, where much of the research comes from, to take a course on it.

Shapiro is among a growing number of radiation oncologists who have begun offering low-dose radiation for osteoarthritis in the hands, feet, knees, shoulders, elbows, and hips. While it's unclear how widely the treatment is available in the US, interviews with multiple radiation oncologists revealed that awareness is growing rapidly.

“We're trying to educate rheumatologists that it's an option,” Shapiro said. “Radiation oncology sounds like we only treat cancer, but we actually treat a lot of other benign conditions with radiation.”

While this therapeutic approach had been new to Shapiro, she soon discovered it's not actually “new” at all.

“It falls into the category of everything old is new again,” she said. “Radiation for arthritis was used as long as radiation has been available.” Indeed, the treatment's first published use was in 1898, Austin Kirschner, MD, PhD, associate professor of radiation oncology at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, told Medscape Medical News. “It was widely used in the US and Europe through much of the 20th century, but its use declined in the US in the 1970s and 1980s as new pharmacologic options became available and concerns about radiation risks emerged,” he said. But low-dose radiation treatment remained a standard osteoarthritis treatment in several European countries, especially Germany, he added.

Today, as clarity about the relatively low risk for malignancies from exposure has become evident and the strength of evidence on radiation's effectiveness for osteoarthritis has grown, awareness of the treatment option is increasing on the Western side of the Atlantic among rheumatologists, primary care doctors, orthopedic surgeons, interventional anesthesiologists, and physical therapists.

“I don't know who's driving it necessarily; the rheumatologists with whom I've worked are very excited and eager about this because their hands are tied at a certain point with a lot of their osteoarthritis patients,” Robert Reznik, MD, assistant professor of radiation oncology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Tarzana, California, told Medscape Medical News. “They're willing to try this. The benefits, especially for patients that are really at their wit's end because of the pain and swelling and the limitations in range of motion, far outweigh the risks.”

No national data currently exist on how widely the treatment is used in the US — Kirschner said it's unclear how many patients receive the treatment or how often referrals occur — but many major academic institutions now offer it, as well as a smattering of community clinics throughout the country.

“When we discuss the treatment with colleagues, we are often met with enthusiasm,” Kirschner said. “Physicians are glad to learn this is another treatment option for patients who are often seeking a noninvasive management approach. They want to exhaust every kind of nonsurgical option and make sure patients get the maximum quality of life and the minimal risks of the treatment.”

Current options for osteoarthritis prior to joint replacement include disease-modifying agents, anti-inflammatories, physical therapy, steroid injections, and lifestyle modifications, such as weight loss and exercise. Ideally, those seeking radiation therapy have radiographically confirmed osteoarthritis with persistent symptoms — a pain score of at least 4 out of 10 — after having exhausted all these options that they aren't contraindicated for.

“Radiation falls somewhere between when the patient has tried other conservative measures [but is not] quite ready for joint replacement,” Shapiro said. It's also most effective for mild-to-moderate osteoarthritis, where patients still have some partially healthy joint architecture and have not yet progressed to bone-on-bone arthritis, by which point radiation is unlikely to be as effective, Kirschner said. “It may help with decreasing inflammation, but it's going to be much more effective if you catch it a little earlier,” Shapiro said.

The most appropriate candidates are older than 40 years or, more conservatively, older than 50 years, to reduce the risk for later malignancies, even though that risk remains extremely low, Kirschner said. In a 70-year-old man who receives low-dose radiation treatment for his knee, the estimated lifetime risk for a radiation-induced cancer is around 0.03%, he said, and even that may be an overestimation because it's derived from whole-body exposure. But risk is higher in younger patients — hence the recommendation only in older patients — or for joints near radiosensitive organs, Kirschner said.

Although low-dose radiation is not included as a recommended treatment in the latest American College of Rheumatology/Arthritis Foundation guideline for the management of hand, hip, and knee osteoarthritis, radiation oncologists interviewed for this article have reported no difficulties with payer coverage. Medicare has covered it for decades, Shapiro said, likely because it had been an established treatment for years before it was abandoned in the 1980s.

There are multiple different mechanisms by which the treatment is theorized to work, Kirschner said. “Radiation modulates immune cell function, reduces proinflammatory cytokines, polarizes macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype, and decreases oxidative stress on the joint,” which differs from the way nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids target specific inflammatory pathways or mediators, he said. The plain language that Reznik and Shapiro use in describing the mechanism to patients is that the radiation halts the “inflammatory cascade” that contributes to osteoarthritis.

Kirschner, who was senior author on a 2022 review of low-dose radiation for osteoarthritis, said that multiple retrospective and prospective studies, mostly from Europe, show moderate- to long-term pain relief with mobility and quality-of-life improvements in about 60%-90% of patients.

“Many large case series and cohort studies show promising pain relief and improved joint function with minimal side effects,” said Bruce McGibbon, MD, associate professor of therapeutic radiology at Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, and medical director of Radiation Oncology at Greenwich Hospital, Greenwich, Connecticut. “So, it's definitely something to consider for patients over age 65 with refractory osteoarthritis. And as randomized trial results become available, the potential use cases could grow significantly.”

Results from randomized controlled trials are far more limited and have been mixed, but a handful show promise, with several other trials starting or ongoing.

A 2023 Russian study of 292 patients with knee osteoarthritis cut the risk for disability in half among those receiving radiation and pharmacology (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.26-0.95) compared with those receiving pharmacology alone. Over a decade of follow-up, 90% of those who underwent radiation had no disability compared with 80% in the control group. In a smaller 2025 study from Iran, 60 patients aged 65 years or older had a baseline pain score of 9/10 for knee osteoarthritis. The radiation group's pain dropped to 6/10 (P < .001), whereas there was no significant change in the sham group's pain scores. In the intervention group, 85% of patients also reported less use of pain medication and improvements in performance status.

The pain relief can last from several months to years, with studies reporting that 30%-60% of patients maintain significant pain reduction 1-2 years after treatment, Kirschner said. Patients do not typically experience acute side effects, though in rare cases they may have some slight redness, milder than a sunburn, on the skin of the area radiated. So far, although malignancy induced by osteoarthritis radiation treatment remains a small theoretical risk, no cases of secondary malignancy have been reported in research for patients older than 40 years.

Still, not all clinicians are convinced that the benefits are worth the risk given other available treatment options. The American College of Rheumatology has yet to recommend low-dose radiation treatment, and it is not considered a standard of care, Bibi Ayesha, MBBS, associate professor of rheumatology and director of the Vasculitis Clinic at Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx, New York, told Medscape Medical News.

“There is very limited literature for consensus guidelines for treatment planning of this low-dose radiation therapy for osteoarthritis. Any exposure to radiation can cause an autoimmune shift that can potentially increase your [risk] for cancer,” she said. Meanwhile, the range of alternative options includes joint braces, NSAID creams, and other topical pain relievers. “Why would you want to expose your patient to radiation when you have other treatment choices?”

While no consensus guidelines from a US medical society currently exist for low-dose radiation for osteoarthritis, radiation oncologists who offer the treatment follow guidelines from the German Society for Radiation Oncology. The most commonly treated joints include hands, feet, shoulders, knees, hips, elbows, and toes — nearly all extremities where the risk for radiation exposure resulting in malignancy is lower than if it were directed in an area with more organs.

“One of the most common areas where radiation can make a big difference is hands and feet because orthopedics doesn't have a lot to offer for small joints, and, functionally, it impacts patients in a really huge way.” Shapiro said clinicians avoid treating arthritis in the spine with radiation because bone marrow production is still occurring there even in older patients. “We worry a little bit more about causing leukemia because [it] has a shorter latency period” between radiation exposure and potential development of a malignancy, Shapiro said.

Although some clinicians also treat arthritis in the ankles, the German guidelines do not currently recommend the therapy for ankle joints.

The treatment protocol begins with an initial consultation, followed by a CT scan to determine the affected area and plan the treatment. Patients then receive six treatments of 0.5 Gy each, conducted two to three times a week over 2-3 weeks. Each treatment lasts about 15 minutes and carries the radiation exposure equivalent of “probably a few CT scans,” Reznik said.

Shapiro reevaluates her patients 3 months later, and if they had an incomplete pain response, the course can be repeated. Kirschner said about half of those who did not respond to an initial course will respond to a second round 3 months later.

Shapiro said her first patient's physical therapist was so impressed with the results that he told other patients about it. “They have a group of very active older adults who told one another, so there's a lot of word of mouth going around,” Shapiro said. And as baby boomers continue aging, demand will likely grow as well, Kirschner and Shapiro said.

“It's a demand that we're able to meet at the moment and hopefully will continue to grow that way, as policies and [logistics] continue to support it,” Kirschner said.

Because only radiation oncologists can offer the treatment, they do need to balance offering the option with their usual caseload of patients with cancer. “I feel like we're opening the floodgates, but I'm trying to do it carefully,” Shapiro said. “Considering how prevalent arthritis is and our aging population, there's a lot of opportunity to expand, but I think we have to do it thoughtfully and really educate referring doctors.”

Ayesha, Kirschner, McGibbon, and Shapiro disclosed having no disclosures. Reznik reported consulting with Varian Medical Systems.

Leagues, Competitiveness and Visibility


In Turkey, the Süper Lig offers electrifying stadiums, passionate fans, and historic clubs like Galatasaray, Fenerbahçe, and Beşiktaş. Contracts are often financially attractive, though stability is not always guaranteed, as salary delays and administrative problems have been reported.





In Portugal, the Primeira Liga works as a launch pad toward Europe's biggest competitions. Clubs like Benfica, Porto, and Sporting are regulars in the Champions League and Europa League, giving young players the ideal exposure to leap to the “big five” leagues.


Mourinho, a Bridge Between Two Worlds


The career of José Mourinho perfectly illustrates what both leagues represent. In Turkey, he managed Fenerbahçe, where his stint was short and full of pressure after failing to qualify for the Champions League. In 2025, he returned to Portugal to take charge of Benfica, the club where he began his managerial journey back in 2000.

His experiences say it all: Turkey offered him a stage filled with passion and high expectations, while Portugal welcomed him with structure, tradition, and the chance to reconnect with his roots. Mourinho embodies how both leagues represent different paths, yet equally influential in a football career.







Culture, Stability and Future


Portugal usually provides a more stable environment, culturally closer to European and Latin American players, with continuity and long-term projection. Turkey, on the other hand, delivers intensity, fiery stadiums, and higher wages, though sometimes at the risk of instability.

Mourinho's return to Benfica proves that even for an experienced coach, both countries carry weight in modern football. Turkey was a brief, demanding challenge; Portugal became a symbolic homecoming, adding value to his story.

In conclusion, if the goal is growth and a stepping stone to the elite, Portugal is the logical choice. If the priority is passion and a lucrative contract, Turkey may be the path. Mourinho's career reminds us that, ultimately, both routes tell different but equally valuable stories.

PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- As the city prepares to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup next summer, the School District of Philadelphia is launching a major initiative to support student soccer players across the city.

Ayana Lewis, executive director of the Office of Strategic Partnerships for the district, called the investment ""amazing.""

""We have the host committee and the USA World Soccer Foundation donating $405,000 to soccer programming, professional development, new soccer equipment, beautification projects - amazing investments in our young people,"" Lewis said.

The partnership will benefit 21 schools and hundreds of students, with support from FIFA and local soccer clubs aimed at helping young athletes elevate their game. Student athletes gathered Tuesday at the South Philly Super Site to celebrate the announcement, just steps from Lincoln Financial Field, where World Cup matches will be held.

""I think all of us collectively, we're just really excited for the World Cup, really excited to see the teams we support play together,"" said Angel Oburu, an 11th grader at Science Leadership Academy at Beeber.

Fatiamh Iprahiam, a 9th grader at SLA Beeber, added, ""I'm so excited for the World Cup, and I'm so excited to hopefully meet my favorite player. I hope so.""

Students from SLA Beeber expressed particular excitement about a new soccer field being built at their school, along with one at Olney High School.

""It's beneficial for me because we get a field to train on, so we can win more games,"" said Sally Doumbia, a 10th grader at SLA Beeber.

Oburu added, ""I definitely feel like when we get the field, it's going to improve all of our stamina, our speed, how fast we are on the field, how we play - because getting on SEPTA is a really hard issue.""

The investment also includes after-school and youth development programs focused on soccer skills, teamwork, and motivation.

Superintendent Dr. Tony Watlington emphasized the long-term impact of the initiative.

""Joy is one of the core values in our five-year aggressive strategic plan entitled Accelerate Philly,"" Watlington said. ""And we expect to have lots of joy over the next year.""

Students interested in joining a team still have time to participate by attending practice and showcasing their skills.","{'href': 'https://6abc.com', 'title': '6abc Philadelphia'}","soccer"

At the age of 36, Zhang Shuai is thriving on court and embracing her role as a ""tennis auntie"" to the younger generation.

After Zhang Shuai thrilled the Diamond Court crowd with a 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 comeback win over qualifier Anastasia Zakharova in the China Open first round, the home favorite was understandably upbeat.

Beijing: Scores | Draws | Order of play

""I'm still very exciting on the court, very exciting back to the home tournament, very exciting play on Diamond Court,"" the 36-year-old said. Her secret? The wide array of dumplings and other delicacies in the player restaurant has been a welcome change. Usually, Zhang's search for a satisfying meal means bypassing tournament food -- “similar because so healthy,” as she put it -- in favor of Chinese eateries worldwide. In Beijing, she's been able to feast.

""Some tournament every day same, same, same,"" she said. ""From qualies to the final, you have to stay there three weeks in the Grand Slam. You couldn't eat every day same, you know? Here, oh my God, before the match, I eat a big dinner. During the match, even three set, I still feeling full so I have full energy. I know I can beat her because I am still full energy, you know?

""Very important for player what you eat. I mean, healthy very important, but what you like more important - for me.""

Fueled by good food, Zhang's win over Zakharova (""We both play really fast and early -- that's the great tennis, I like very much the tennis like this"") was a full-circle moment for her. This time last year, she memorably snapped a 24-match losing streak, and went all the way to the quarterfinals -- a result that has helped re-establish her on tour, with a singles ranking of No. 112 and a doubles position of No. 14 this week.

That experience is one of many that mean Zhang is perfectly placed to be a mentor to younger Chinese up-and-coming talents -- the tennis version of the quintessential auntie figure in Asian culture. Her role as an elder of the sport is one she embraces.

""When I was practicing at the Diamond Court, somebody told me, 'I watched you when I was in elementary school, and now I'm in college,'"" she said. ""It just proves that I've been playing a long time.""

That's why, when she sees young players struggle, Zhang is empathetic.

""When I see them, they're always full of panic, have a panicked face,"" she said. ""They are anxious. Many uncertainties. I have gone through so much. I will be able to maintain a calm mindset. You cannot force this level of calm on a very young player.

""Talk about the Chinese classic journey to the west. You talk to those people when they start the journey. Of course, it will be quite different when they finish the journey. The only thing you can do is to encourage the young players. You just say positive things: 'I see you improve a lot every day.'""

China's quarterfinal loss to Italy at last week's Billie Jean King Cup Finals was one occasion on which Zhang had to put her best pep talks into practise. On home soil, both Yuan Yue and Wang Xinyu both led their singles rubbers by a set and a break, only to be reeled in by Elisabetta Cocciaretto and Jasmine Paolini respectively.

A post shared by Billie Jean King Cup (@billiejeankingcup)

""After the BJK Cup, two girls were blaming themselves,"" Zhang said. ""I said to them, 'You didn't fail, we're just one step closer to success. Every success is based on rounds of failures.' I tell them, 'You're great, you did a good job. Look at yourself. You are just one step away from victory. It was easy in the quarterfinals and semifinals. We were this close to victory.'

""They were reviewing this point and that point. Just forget them. Sometimes when I finish a match, I just forget those moments because there's no way for you to return to that moment. If you don't take this option, other people won't do it. This is tennis. This is professional sport. What we can do is to make tomorrow better.""

That's a lesson directly taken from Zhang's own ups and downs. Twelve months ago, she was considering retirement. Now, the ""motivation for battle"" is burning strongly again, and she can't envisage stopping.

""I know I can play well -- last year I'm not sure,"" she said. ""That's why I always talking to all the girls, 'You much better than you thought. You have to trust yourself. You have to believe yourself because everyone better than you thought.'""

	“I finally got an agent and they said: ‘Your name is too ethnic,” I go, What do you mean?' They go, ‘No, too ethnic. They're never going to hire you. Your new name is Lenny Williams. ‘What's Lenny Williams?' ‘We took your middle name and made it your last name and now [your first] name is Lenny.' And my dad saw [the headshot photo the agent took], he ripped it up, and said, ‘Over my dead body.'” 

	











	At this point, del Toro gestured to himself and said “Benny Del,” suggesting that he, too, received similar advice early in his career. 


	When the duo is asked what was “on their Mount Rushmore of movies,” DiCaprio listed East of Eden, Taxi Driver and 2001: A Space Odyssey, while del Toro cited Papillon and On the Waterfront.


	Asked about pieces of advice they were given, DiCaprio recalled being on the set of This Boy's Life when he was 16, working across from Robert De Niro when director Michael Caton-Jones advised: “‘Watch [De Niro]. Pain is temporary, film is forever.' That's the note that hit me the hardest that stayed with me forever.”


	The duo was also asked if they could act in one role that the other starred in, which would it be? DiCaprio said Sicaro, “that shit was badass.” While del Toro said, The Wolf of Wall Street.

	











	Director Paul Thomas Anderson's One Battle After Another is receiving terrific reviews and is set to open in theaters on Friday.

After giving extensive notes on the script and reviewing daily shot lists, the team offered her producing credit on all three installments.


							By 

	Brian Davids


Writer


	We've all watched the credits to a movie and passed some degree of judgment when the star of the movie is also listed as a producer of some sort. We'll sometimes jump to the conclusion that it must be a vanity credit, one that was offered as sweetener in order to close an actor's deal. But in the case of Madelaine Petsch's The Strangers trilogy, her executive producer title is well-merited.


	Opening Sept. 26 in movie theaters, The Strangers: Chapters 2 once again chronicles Petsch's Maya as she's pursued across a small Oregon town by the titular serial killers. Petsch, along with director Renny Harlin and producer Courtney Solomon, managed to shoot an entire trilogy in just 52 days. That figure ultimately changed once they addressed fan criticism of Chapter 1, adding three-to-four weeks of additional filming on Chapter 2 and 3. But throughout each phase of photography, Petsch imposed her will in order to better the product on the screen.

	“I did not have the credit at first. I came on set and said, ‘Hey guys, would you be willing to listen to [some script thoughts]?'” Petsch tells The Hollywood Reporter. “And that ultimately became [producer] Courtney Solomon and I editing the script every day after set, going through shot lists with Renny [Harlin] and being more sewn into the fabric of the story in a producorial way. So they offered me the EP credit; it was not a vanity credit that I got.”

	










			Popular on THR		







	Petsch adds that vanity credits are often a necessity for smaller productions.


	“Usually, they'll do that to pay actors less money because they don't have a lot of money,” Petsch says. “They'll be like, ‘We'll give you an EP credit, which will help you, but it's a vanity credit.' So I got offered this credit because I was actually doing the work.”


	Below, during a recent conversation with THR, Petsch also previews the concluding chapter of her Strangers trilogy and why she hopes it'll break the fall release pattern of Chapter 1 and 2.


	***


When we spoke last year for The Strangers: Chapter 1, I asked you what scene will likely linger for years to come, and you said you'd tell me after I saw Chapter II. Was it the wild boar sequence? 


	That's the one! 


I have a feeling that the boar sequence is really important to Maya's overall arc. Am I correct or incorrect to draw that conclusion?


	Yeah, you're very, very, very, very correct in that conclusion. 


What struck me most about Chapter 2 is how little dialogue there is. It's partly the nature of Maya being alone and on the run from silent attackers. Does no dialogue make your job all the more difficult, since you have to sell each moment physically?


	There's pros and cons to it. It definitely is more challenging because you just don't really do it that often in this industry. You either have a scene partner to do no dialogue off of, giving you something to react to, or you've got dialogue to rely on. I would say there's probably an hour of this film with no dialogue in it, and it's just a different challenge that's not done very often. So there's definitely pros and cons to both, and it's really fun to flex that muscle.

	











For example, there's an interesting moment where she silently takes inventory of her wounds and scars in front of a mirror. What was on your mind in that moment?


	It's the first time that Maya sees herself and sees the physical manifestation of everything she's been through. It's the moment where it all hits her. It's like, “This is my reality now.” When you're in this state of fight or flight, and survival, you're not really thinking, “I can't believe this is happening to me.” You're just thinking, “I've got to survive.” So in that moment when she stops and catches herself in the mirror, she's taking inventory of every single attack and every single thing she's been through in the last 24-to-48 hours that has changed her innately as a human being. And ultimately, I think she is, in real time, saying goodbye to that final piece of humanity. 


Lionsgate released a clip of the morgue scene where Maya encounters her deceased fiancé (Froy Gutierrez's Ryan). Was that dummy Froy? Or real Froy?


	Real Froy! He's very good at being still. It wasn't as weird as you might think. It really didn't affect us at all. When you're shooting a movie like this, that's the least of your concerns. 


You told me previously that you helped punch up the 278-page script for all three chapters and suggested scenes like the shower scene in Chapter 1. Was that your way of making the most of your EP credit? 












	I actually did not have the credit at first. I was asked to be an actor in the film, and I wholeheartedly said yes. I then came on set and said, “Hey guys, I have some script thoughts. Would you be willing to listen to them?” And that ultimately became [producer] Courtney Solomon and I editing the script every day after set, going through shot lists with Renny [Harlin] and being more sewn into the fabric of the story in a producorial way. So they offered me the EP credit; it was not a vanity credit that I got. Usually, they'll do that to pay actors less money because they don't have a lot of money. They'll be like, “We'll give you an EP credit, which will help you, but it's a vanity credit.” So I got offered this credit because I was actually doing the work. 


The financial success of Chapter 1 afforded you and your team 23-to-28 days of additional photography. Are you glad that you got to go back and fine tune Chapter 2 and 3?


	Absolutely. It made both films amazing and way stronger. Chapter 2 had 8 days [of additional photography] and Chapter 3 had 15.


There's a trailer for Chapter 3 in the mid-credits of Chapter 2, and there's a very tantalizing glimpse at what's to come. What's your best elevator pitch for Chapter 3?


Chapter 3 is a face-off between the two main characters where you start struggling with the idea of who the protagonist is and who the antagonist really is. 


The trailer has a moment where my jaw dropped about what was revealed, but then I noticed a little detail that made me second-guess what I saw. So I'm very curious how everything is going to shake out.












	It's so funny because somebody else brought that moment up and didn't notice that, so I was like, “Go back and watch her wrists again.”


Do you expect Chapter 3 to follow the fall release pattern of Chapter 1 and 2?


	If it [goes] our way, then hopefully it'll be sooner. That would be the goal. It is basically done. But it's about whatever Lionsgate feels and what fits into their release schedule the best. It's also about what other movies are already releasing during those weekends, so that's up to the Lionsgate Gods. All I know is that we are done, and we are ready to show it as soon as possible.


At the Chapter 1 premiere, your former Riverdale castmates, Lili Reinhart and Camila Mendes, showed up to support you, and I thought that was a really lovely gesture. It's so easy to lose track of friends as time passes, so did the three of you make a pact to not let that happen?


	Those two girls are still my absolute best friends in the whole world. It can go one of two ways when you shoot a show like that, and it went the right way with us. We all came up together in a really intense environment, having shot up to a world that we'd never been in before: fame and a successful TV show. We had each other to constantly lean on in any scenario. We still call each other to be like, “I am doing this movie. Have you heard of this director?” And someone will say, “Oh, I met with him.” And someone will ask, “What was your experience like?” We're a unit. No matter what we do or where we are, we always support each other. It's rare in Hollywood to find people who don't feel competitive with you and support you so unabashedly, so I'm really lucky to have found my people. 

	











You also starred in and EP'd a romcom that's coming out on Oct. 8. Was Maintenance Required meant to be a palate cleanser after all the fictional trauma you endured in your Strangers trilogy?


	(Laughs.) It was not meant to be a palate cleanser. I like variety. Variety is the spice of life. I think actors want to do everything, at least I do. So I love the idea of being in an Amazon romcom where I get to play a mechanic and do something completely different. As an artist, it was just fun, and I think it'll be fun for audiences. I never knew they were going to come out this close together, to be honest. But I think it'll be fun for audiences to be able to go see me in this horror film — and go through the PTSD of it — before coming home to cuddle up and watch something that's sweet and cozy.

This week: Gruesome headlines lead to rising streams for alt-pop hitmaker D4vd, while performers at the Charlie Kirk memorial service and songs featured in a much-anticipated Amazon Prime series finale see gains.

	Following a quick rise and a handful of viral hits, D4vd has been featured in disturbing headlines in recent weeks following the discovery of a dead body in a car reportedly registered to the singer-songwriter. The human remains were uncovered inside an impounded Tesla on Sept. 8, and last Wednesday (Sept. 17), the body was identified as Celeste Rivas Hernandez, a 15-year-old girl who had previously been reported missing and, as Internet sleuths pointed out, had multiple connections to D4vd prior to her disappearance. Although no charges have been brought against the 20-year-old singer, D4vd canceled multiple tour dates without explanation in the following days.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Following the reports, D4vd's overall streams have experienced significant gains — including the viral hit that helped deliver him to the mainstream. From Sept. 18-22, D4vd's catalog earned 30.3 million official on-demand U.S. streams, more than double the total from the previous five-day tracking period (13.8 million streams from Sept. 12-16), according to preliminary data provided by Luminate. Within that total, “Romantic Homicide,” which reached No. 33 on the Hot 100 after going viral in 2022, was among the greatest gainers. From Sept. 12-15, the track earned 2.9 million streams; one week later, that total was 9.4 million (up 224%). “Romantic Homicide” and other D4vd tracks have popped up on the Spotify daily top 50 chart as this tragic story has developed. – JASON LIPSHUTZ












	On Sunday (Sept. 21), a memorial service for the assassinated conservative media figure and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk was held at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Az. — with over 90,000 in attendance, and speakers who included both President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, as well as Kirk's widow Erika. As Kirk had been outspoken in his Christian faith, contemporary Christian music featured prominently in the proceedings — including performances from some of the biggest names in contemporary worship music, paying tribute to Kirk. 


	Several of those performers experienced notable catalog gains following their performances. Brandon Lake, perhaps currently the biggest name in contemporary Christian music following his crossover breakthrough this year with the Hot 100 top 40 hit “Hard Fought Hallelujah,” collected over 4.3 million official on-demand U.S. streams on Monday (Sept. 22), the day after the service, according to preliminary data provided by Luminate. That was up 29% from the 3.4 million he drew the Monday before, and included a 76% gain for “Gratitude,” the 2020 song he performed at the ceremony, to 909,000 streams.


	Similar catalog gains were posted by service performers Cody Carnes (up 7% to 717,000), Kari Jobe (up 27% to 296,000) and Chris Tomlin (up 30% to just over 2 million) on that Monday — while Lee Greenwood's perennial “God Bless the U.S.A.” was up nearly 13% to 59,000 streams. – ANDREW UNTERBERGER


	After seven years, Cardi B's long-awaited sophomore album Am I the Drama?,is finally here — and it's already having quite the impact on streaming. Released on Sept. 19, Drama has earned 78.3 million official on-demand U.S. streams in its first three days of release, according to Luminate. Of that three-day total, the album pulled 35.8 million streams on Sept. 19, 25.4 million on Sept. 20 and another 17 million streams on Sept. 21. The new album also spurred notable gains for the Bronx MC's Grammy-winning debut album, Invasion of Privacy. That set earned 4.15 million official on-demand U.S. streams during Drama's release weekend (Sept. 19-21), marking a 31% increase from the 3.17 million streams it collected the previous weekend (Sept. 12-14). 


Drama is filled with nifty samples, but two particular flips have boosted their original tracks: On the Lizzo-assisted “What's Going On,” Cardi sources 4 Non Blonde's “What's Up,” helped the 1993 track pull over 981,00 official on-demand U.S. streams during Drama's release weekend (Sept. 19-21). That marks a 7% lift from the 914,000 streams the track earned the previous weekend (Sept. 12-14). Placed near the end of the album, “Principal” calls upon Janet Jackson's “The Pleasure Principle,” which reaped 52,000 official on-demand U.S. streams during Drama's release weekend (Sept. 19-21), marking a 30% leap from the 40,2000 streams it pulled the previous weekend (Sept. 12-14). — KYLE DENIS 


	Over three seasons, Amazon Prime's romantic coming-of-age drama series The Summer I Turned Pretty proved itself not only one of the biggest shows of the decade, but one of the most prominent users of music synchs in recent TV history — with synch-tracking website Tunefind listing 104 songs used in its third season alone. That third and final season came to an end last Wednesday (Sept. 17) with 11 synchs used the season finale — all of which of course saw major bumps on streaming following their usage. 

	











	With much of the finale taking place in Paris, multiple French songs were used in the episode, with the biggest gains going to Belgian artist Angele's “Ta Reine” — which was up a whopping 1,130% in official on-demand U.S. streams (to 130,000) over the five days following the episode premiere (Sept. 18-22) compared to the five-day period before (Sept. 12-16), according to preliminary data provided by Luminate. More in the show's typical musical wheelhouse were synchs from Noah Kahan (“Everwhere, Everything,” also featuring Gracie Abrams) and Phoebe Bridgers (“Scott Street”), with the songs rising 45% and 79% to 1.9 million and 1.5 million streams over the same period, respectively.


	But of course, the biggest bumps overall were reserved for the artist who's served as the show's musical north star for essentially its entire run: Taylor Swift. The Taylor's Version of 1989 fan favorite “Out of the Woods” was used during a climactic Paris scene in the episode, and saw a 184% gain to 961,000 streams over that five-day period after. And even more impressively, Swift's Reputation highlight “Dress” saw gains of 666% after being used in a dramatic finale makeout scene, rising to 436,000 to 3.4 total million streams over the same period. 


	And in case your hearts and/or Spotify playlists are hurting following the show's series finale, fret not: it was announced during the finale's red carpet celebration that The Summer I Turned Pretty would be returning for a franchise-concluding feature-length film, at a date to be determined. – AU

The singer recently revealed that he's finishing work on his untitled third solo album, which he's feeling ""really really good"" about.

	Gil Kaufman



Louis Tomlinson is feeling sweet, but also a bit bitter. The former One Direction singer appeared to crank up the promo machine for his as-yet-untitled third solo album another notch on Tuesday (Sept. 23) when he dropped a 15-second teaser for the upcoming single “Lemonade.”

	The song, due out on Tuesday (Sept. 30), is a soaring pop balloon, with Tomlinson singing, “She's so bitter, she's so sweet/ Lemonade, lemonade/ A little taste is all I need/ Lemonade,” over driving drums and a joyful arrangement. The accompanying peek at what looks like the music video, finds Tomlinson — his hair buzzed on the sides and grown out and shaggy on top —  hanging out in a field in front of a towering stack of speakers and a rusted-out old car.

	The singer has been busy lately teasing the follow-up to his 2022 sophomore LP, Faith in the Future, telling fans earlier this month that the untitled album is nearly complete. “Just sat listening to the new record and I've got a really really good feeling this time around!” he wrote on X at the time. “Can't wait for you all to hear it!!” 




			Trending on Billboard		







Faith in the Future featured the singles “Bigger Than Me,” “Out of My System” and “Silver Tongues,” and debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 album chart, while giving Tomlinson his first No. 1 on the UK albums chart.

	











	At press time no title or release date have been announced for Tomlinson's third LP, though he has some upcoming gigs where fans are hoping he'll debut other new songs. In fact, when one commenter expressed frustration at the lack of information on the album earlier this month, Tomlinson teased, “or maybe I'm going to play something new at away from home,” following up with, “it's about time isn't it” and “Really really excited about it! Got a few surprises. Should be fun.”


	Tomlinson will be among the headliners at the upcoming New York edition of his Away From Home Festival (Oct. 4-5) at Brewery Ommegang in Cooperstown, where he'll appear alongside his personally curated list of fellow performers, including Lauv, Steve Aoki, Plain White T's, Daya, Circa Waves, Pale Waves and others. He will also take part in BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge Month on Oct. 29, where guests typically perform one of their own songs as well as a cover song.

					By Andreas Wiseman 

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: In an eight-figure deal, understood to be the biggest out of this year's TIFF market so far, new U.S. distributor Row K has taken rights to the Cliffhanger reboot starring Pierce Brosnan and Lily James.


	The reimagining of the 1993 classic, directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Carry-On), is currently in post-production and is being lined for a 3,000 screen stateside theatrical release in 2026. 


	The film will follow a seasoned mountaineer, Ray Cooper (Brosnan), who operates a luxury chalet in the Dolomites with his daughter, Sydney. During a weekend trip with a billionaire's son, they are targeted by a gang of kidnappers. Ray's other daughter Naomi (James), still haunted by a past climbing accident, witnesses the attack and escapes. To save her family, she must confront her fears and fight for survival.

	The pic is written by Ana Lily Amirpour, Sascha Penn, Mark Bianculli and Melanie Toast. Producers include Lars Sylvest of Thank You Pictures, Joe Neurauter of Supernix, Thorsten Schumacher of Rocket Science, and Neal Moritz and Toby Jaffe.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The acquisition was negotiated on behalf of the filmmakers by CAA Media Finance, which is representing domestic rights. Rocket Science is handling international sales.


	The deal marks Row K's third buy out of TIFF since its launch in August, following Gus Van Sant's Dead Man's Wire starring Bill Skarsgård, Dacre Montgomery, Cary Elwes, Myha'la, Colman Domingo and Al Pacino, and Tom Dean and Mac Eldridge's Charlie Harper starring Nick Robinson and Emilia Jones. 


	“Cliffhanger is an exciting addition to Row K's growing slate and a clear example of the kind of event-level films we are bringing to the marketplace,” said MCT Principals and Row K Co-Chairman Christopher Woodrow and Raj Singh. “We are building a pipeline of star-driven titles made for the big screen, and Cliffhanger checks every box. Our third acquisition underscores the momentum we're generating and the type of ambitious, audience-forward distribution model Row K was designed to deliver.”

	











	Added Row K President Megan Colligan: “What drew me to Jaume Collet-Serra's Cliffhanger is how it blends the adrenaline and scale of a classic action movie with a fresh, modern twist – exactly the experience that younger audiences are showing up for. The original Cliffhanger was celebrated for its mountain cinematography, and this reimagining honors that legacy with sweeping backdrops across Europe – the result is a stunning production built for theaters.”


	As we revealed during the TIFF market, there are early stage talks about a sequel to the reboot. The 1993 original, which took $255M global, starred Sylvester Stallone with Renny Harlin directing.


	Row K, backed by Media Capital Technologies, takes its name from the seat often considered the best view in the theater. The company recently appointed Mo Rhim as Chief Revenue Officer, Ben Carlson as Chief Marketing Officer and Steve Garrett as Head of Distribution and Acquisitions.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


	More than 100 former ABC News employees including Sam Donaldson, Tom Bettag and Judy Muller have signed on to a letter urging Disney CEO Bob Iger to step it up when it comes to publicly defending journalists under political attacks and the company itself against government pressure.


	“We want to acknowledge and commend your decision to reinstate Jimmy Kimmel's show,” the ABC News employees wrote in the letter, first reported by CNN. “It was the right call and an important statement that political intimidation should not dictate ABC's programming. This action reflects the values that have long defined The Walt Disney Company.

	











	“Yet, it must be just the first step in a concerted effort to defend free speech and press freedom against political intimidation. The $16 million settlement with Donald Trump, combined with the absence of a strong public defense of ABC News journalists under attack, has emboldened Administration efforts to intimidate the press.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Also signing on to the letter was Kayce Freed Jennings, the widow of World News Tonight anchor Peter Jennings. The letter was organized by Lisa Stark, a former correspondent, and Ian Cameron, a former executive producer, per CNN.


	The letter states: “Your legacy includes a reputation as a staunch defender of the essential role of journalism in a healthy democracy. We urge you now to reaffirm that legacy by: Making clear that ABC News—and Disney—will not be silenced or intimidated by political pressure; Publicly and unequivocally defending ABC journalists against political attacks; Aggressively pushing back against government efforts to undermine the First Amendment.”

	











	In December, just before Donald Trump took office, ABC settled his defamation lawsuit for $16 million. Trump sued the network and George Stephanopoulos over the This Week anchor's claim that the then-former president had been found liable for rape by a New York jury. In fact, Trump was found liable to sexual assault.


	Last week, hours after FCC chairman Brendan Carr warned ABC stations over a remark that Jimmy Kimmel made on his ABC late-night show, the network pulled Jimmy Kimmel Live! indefinitely. But that action generated a backlash against Disney, with Barack Obama and former CEO Michael Eisner calling on corporate executives to stand up to the administration.


	A Disney spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.


	Just before Kimmel returned to the air on Tuesday, Trump posted a new threat to the network, vowing to take action alleging that his show was an “illegal campaign contribution.” “I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do,” Trump wrote.


	The Federal Election Commission has a news media exemption, and a campaign finance expert, Saurav Ghosh, director of federal campaign finance reform at the Campaign Legal Center, said that the network and Disney also would fall under an exemption for commercial activity. “There is no indication the decision [to bring Kimmel back] is being driven by anything other than a commercial decision. That is not even close to a campaign contribution,” Ghosh said.

backbone does not magically grow. I think it's laughable to expect backbones from executives who were promoted for lacking it.

In the ABC markets where Sinclair and Nextar refused to air Kimmel, Iger should have offered up the show to other competing networks.  

Watch how fast they'd suddenly want the show back.

Hasn't this ship sailed? What about the $16 million settlement with Donald Trump? That's caving to political pressure.

Well let's see, Trump clearly doesn't like Jimmy or anyone who pokes fun at him,so y is it funny when Trump nicknames people and thinks it's funny and calls other people criminals, with ni evidence what so ever,one person is joking and the other is being a bully, so I think our president has more important things to do. So all his yes people around him should concentrate on that and let's actually make America great again,we have to stop and start living like the constitution was written.  After all we are the people!!!!

Bob looks confused why he has to choose principles over money.

I stopped watching early on, mostly because the two new ADAs are too tame. Thia show needs much more Jack McCoy-style passion.

Maybe this will be the year when the writers stop having the cops call across the street or across the room to a suspect (who never turns out to be guilty), who then bolts, triggering a foot chase that ends with a tackle.

LOL. That's a pet peeve of mine, too.

I hope he stays, but with what this reboot has going on, if he's not gone by season end, someone will be.

I wish more people would question the leadership over this show. I try my hardest to get into it but I just get bored watching or either feel some kind of way negative after. It's like it's been written by political commentator millennials. Plus boss Rick Eid's reputation preceeds him. On SVU he was bad. Chicago PD turned super dark. His FBI work was decent at best. Wolf needs to find new blood to run these shows if he can't get people back like he did Michele Fazekas on SVU.

Ah – I was wondering about that when they previewed the cast and there was no second detective. Hopefully he stays for a while.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Stephen Kostanski goes full Roger Corman for his goofy, mayhem-filled Deathstalker remake","https://www.avclub.com/deathstalker-review","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 22:00:00 GMT","

There is a freewheeling energy to a Stephen Kostanski movie, a feeling that you've walked in on a group of friends partaking in a grand game of make-believe. It's not that what was filmed was spontaneous, but that there's the sense that it wasn't filmed at all. It's just beaming into its audience's heads, a cosmic signal from a long-abandoned video store. Kostanski's deliberate and detailed aesthetic choices are proof that there's an encompassing plan, but the playful daring emanating from each of his low-budget projects also feels tougher to sustain as the films get larger. With Deathstalker, Kostanski attempts to bring his loose, gleeful style to the sword and sorcery genre, and mostly succeeds, giving us another midnight movie essential.

Based on the 1983 Roger Corman film of the same name, Kostanski's version follows Deathstalker (action staple Daniel Bernhardt), a warrior and scavenger living in a world beset by war. He spends his days roaming battlefields and picking valuables off the corpses. One day, he finally picks up something he shouldn't have—an amulet with a dark history tied to the kingdom's oldest enemies—and he literally can't get rid of it. It'll keep coming back to him until he dies or until he performs an arcane spell to break the curse. So, with the help of a flirty thief (Christina Orjalo) and a diminutive sorcerer (played in costume by Laurie Field, voiced by Patton Oswalt), Deathstalker sets out to break this curse, and unknowingly walks into a date with destiny. 

There are a lot of classic sword-and-sorcery beats here, from the reluctant hero to the quest for redemption to a weird little guy named “Doodad” just following you around, helping out with magic. Those nostalgic for 1970s and 1980s fantasy films of this stripe, for the age of Beastmaster, will find lots to love here. But Deathstalker is at its best when Bernhardt plays the title role like a put-upon, working-class grave robber just trying to get a monkey off his back, and Kostanski knows when to step back and let that irreverence shine through.

Irreverence is a key part of the Psycho Goreman filmmaker's toolkit, and Deathstalker‘s weak point is that these moments have never felt less at home. Certain scenes featuring grand pronouncements from villains while the heroes are talking like regular people are a chuckle-worthy juxtaposition, but Kostanski's script wants to have its cake and eat it too when it comes to serious fantasy and scattershot comedy.

Yet these growing pains, as a filmmaker stretches his shtick into a new genre, are often overshadowed by the sheer force of the primary-colored mayhem erupting onscreen. Centering Bernhardt's skills as a stunt performer and martial artist, set piece after set piece explodes with color, movement, and creatures that both evoke the 1980s and strive to push the throwback vibe to new extremes. The fights are fun, the monsters are beautifully realized, and the sheer number of genre tropes this film packs into its 100 minutes is enough to make the most battleworn Dungeon Master drop their jaw.

Though his pop culture homages are often what get viewers in the door, Kostanski has always been after something more than revitalizing old aesthetics. Like his low-budget heroes before him, the filmmaker captures the innate urgency that comes from making something with your hands and beaming it out in the world. There's still something electric about being in the trenches of the indie genre world, and Deathstalker proves that power is still there even as the films get a little bit bigger.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Nate Bargatze kind of thought studios would get in on his Boys & Girls Club Emmy's bit","https://www.avclub.com/nate-bargatze-netflix-emmy-donation-bit","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 22:26:01 GMT","

As viewers of the ceremony know, first-time Emmy's host Nate Bargatze came up with a novel (if mildly controversial) method to get award recipients to cut their acceptance speeches short at this year's show: Every second winners went over their allotted 45-second window, Bargatze would deduct a thousand dollars from a planned $100,000 donation he intended to make to the Boys & Girls Club Of America. As viewers of the show also know, the gesture backfired from a couple of different angles. Reviewers of the show weren't wild about seeing that kind of social pressure applied to getting winners to wrap it up more quickly—overages might irritate CBS, the network airing the show, but a lot of folks like the speeches. But also, it essentially failed as a deterrent: By the end of the night, the number was actually more than $50,000 in the hole, which caused CBS to step in and cover the original $100,000 donation, while Bargatze pledged another $250,000 of his own money.

﻿

Which wasn't exactly how it was supposed to go down, according to an appearance that the comic made on his own Nateland podcast this week. Saying he “almost sent an email out” ahead of the show to try to explain his intent, Bargatze says he initially envisioned the studios stepping up—or being encouraged to step up by their stars—to cover when talent overran their time. “If someone was giving these long speeches, I just thought they could be like, ‘and Netflix is gonna cover my overage,'” Bargatze explained, saying it would have allowed stars to “Go long, but then be a hero.”

To be clear, Bargatze isn't complaining about having to pony up himself: He's one of the most successful stand-ups on the planet, with Billboard estimating that he's made something north of $80 million from touring alone. (He did, after all, end up donating significantly more than he initially said he would at the outset of the show, basically just to give the whole thing a feel-good ending.) In the podcast, he seems more lightly annoyed that nobody else was on his wavelength with the bit, even while asserting that both CBS and audiences at home enjoyed the concept.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Pure chemistry is the only science that sci-fi romance All Of You needs","https://www.avclub.com/all-of-you-review","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 18:00:00 GMT","

Romantic drama All Of You comes with a big sci-fi hook. In a near-future version of London, a glossy tech company has created a soulmate “test” that pairs each person who takes it with their perfect match—happiness scientifically guaranteed. It's a premise that seems right out of an episode of Black Mirror, but though All Of You indulges in some lightly futuristic touches, its tone is more earnestly retro than forward-looking. There are surface similarities to sci-fi romances like Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind and Timer, but at its heart All Of You is more like a cross between two pre-dating-app classics: When Harry Met Sally and Brief Encounter.

Subbing in for Harry is Brett Goldstein's Simon, a wry but caring journalist who's more in line with Goldstein's softer real-life persona than his grumpy Ted Lasso alter ego. Simon's “Sally” is his old university friend Laura (Imogen Poots), a flighty, sarcastic cool girl who shares his dark sense of humor. From the moment they first slip into a gentle hug, their connection is palpable. As they banter on the tube ride to Laura's test appointment, Simon jokes that this is going to ruin their friendship; no one keeps up with their college buddies once they've found their soulmate. For his part, he'd rather just find love organically than take the clinical approach. Or perhaps he just feels he's already found his perfect match. 

Scientifically, however, Laura's soulmate isn't Simon but Lukas (Steven Cree), a responsible Scotsman whose straightforwardness at least theoretically balances out Laura's sarcasm. The film casually, almost disorientingly hops forward in time as Laura and Lukas get more serious and Simon begins dating Laura's friend Andrea (Zawe Ashton). Yet even as the years pass, the chemistry between Laura and Simon never fades. If anything, the longing between them only grows as Simon provides a certain breezy escape from Laura's increasingly adult concerns.

As with this summer's Materialists, one can read All Of You as a commentary on modern dating app culture and the obsession with optimizing and gamifying our lives like we're algorithms to be perfected. But, also like Materialists, All Of You also deals with themes as timeless as love itself: the fear of ruining a friendship by making it romantic, the fear of ruining a romance by chasing the fantasy of something better, the fear of ruining your life by remaining stuck in indecision. As the film moves into weighty topics like marriage, babies, and parental death, the “soulmate” conceit becomes a bit of a cheat code to give the Lukas half of this love triangle equal weight, even as the film narrows its focus to just Simon and Laura. 

In that sense, All Of You lives and dies on the performances from Goldstein and Poots, who are essentially in a two-hander play for much of its runtime. Simon and Laura are the type of people more likely to crack a joke than to actually say what they mean—summed by a vignette where Simon rushes Laura to the hospital for a medical emergency she doesn't want to acknowledge. So it's a good thing that the two lead performers excel at giving their characters rich, complex inner lives that peek through their cheeky banter. There's a childish self-centeredness to Laura, who chases whatever makes her feel most comfortable in the moment; a husband for life's serious moments and a maybe-more-than-friend for the rest. And there's a quiet sadness to Simon, who would rather accept a half-life of happiness than let go of the woman he loves from afar. 

That Simon and Laura are at least somewhat self-aware of those flaws only adds to their bittersweet relationship. Director William Bridges (the “USS Callister” writer who, before co-writing this script with Goldstein, made the similarly-premised anthology series Soulmates with him) has a keen eye for the details of human behavior, both in the film's goofier rom-com moments and its more serious drama. While a few scenes veer a touch too far into repetitive melodrama, All Of You is elevated by the tremendous chemistry between two actors who are allowed to be a little thornier and less likable than your average romance leads.

That means All Of You doesn't just offer a will-they-won't-they for Simon and Laura, but serves up one for its audience too. It's hard to decide whether to root for them to be together or to let each other go; both choices seem impossible and necessary in equal measure. It's an appreciably adult dilemma for an appreciably adult drama. As with so many great onscreen romances, it's not that All Of You is doing something that's never been done before, just that it's doing it really well, with a great pair of actors at its center.

Kate Gosselin is stepping into a new chapter of life — and she's doing it with a familiar face by her side.

According to Page Six, the former “Jon & Kate Plus 8” star is dating Steve Neild, her longtime former bodyguard.

The pairing has sparked warm reactions from fans who remember Neild as a steady presence during Gosselin's early years in the spotlight. He became her bodyguard in 2008 and has been photographed with the reality TV star many times throughout the years.

The relationship marks Gosselin's most significant romance since her split from Jon Gosselin in 2009.

The star was married to Jon Gosselin from 1999 to 2009. They had twins Madelyn and Cara, as well as sextuplets Aaden, Collin, Joel, Hannah, Alexis and Leah.

For years, she kept her dating life almost entirely private, focusing on raising her eight children while managing the challenges of reality TV fame.

Now, reports suggest that her bond with Neild has grown beyond the professional, blossoming into something more personal and supportive.

A source told Page Six the two are living together and have been an item for a while.

“There's no doubt that Kate is crazy about him … things are serious, they have discussed wedding plans and moving on that next stage,” the source told the outlet.

While neither Gosselin nor Neild has spoken publicly about the relationship, the buzz reflects a hopeful shift for the television personality.

Hints of Gosselin's new romance surfaced earlier in the week when she surprised fans during a TikTok Q&A session.

Answers to some of your burning questions!🤣 #travel #QandA 

Smiling as she addressed the camera, she admitted she had been seeing someone quietly for “a little over a year.”

“And finally, ‘Are you dating?'” she read aloud from a fan's question. “The answer … is actually, finally, yes.”

Without naming names, Gosselin explained her partner is “somebody that I've known for a really long time,” adding that she is “super, super happy.”

She described him as private, someone who prefers to avoid TikTok appearances, but hinted fans might see him in the future.

“You perhaps will catch a peep of him here and there or once in a while going forward,” she said.

Fans reacted to the video and said, “I heard it was Steve is this true?? He was handsome lol!!!”

Another added, “I'm so happy for you , you deserve to be with someone who makes you happy.”

“Wonderful news all around! I'm so happy for you Kate! You deserve so much happiness and joy,” one user gushed.

Danny Thompson, the legendary jazz and folk bassist whose career spanned over 60 years, has passed away at the age of 86. His team confirmed on September 24 that he passed away peacefully the day before at his home in Rickmansworth, UK. 

Thompson was celebrated not only for his remarkable musicianship but also for his generosity of spirit. In a heartfelt Instagram tribute, he was remembered as “a force of nature. 

A post shared by Danny Thompson (@therealdannythompson)

A player who served the song and who enriched the lives of every single person he met.” 

A post shared by Danny Thompson (@therealdannythompson)

The statement praised him as “beloved and admired by everybody he worked with,” with a body of work that was both unparalleled in quality and extraordinary in its variety, spanning collaborations with jazz greats, folk pioneers, and global icons.

A post shared by Nick Welsh (@nickwelsh62)

Praising his talent, a comment read: “So sorry to hear this. What an absolute icon 💗” 

One comment read: “The only bass player to have played with Nick Drake,Tim Buckley and John Martyn❤️” 

Another sweet comment read: “It always felt like Danny would be there forever. Farewell to one of the greatest to ever pick up the bass. Love and deep condolences to Sylvia and Dan. He changed my life for the better ❤️😔” 

A post shared by Anthony Blakeney (@anthony_blakeney_jewellery)

Praising his influence, a fan wrote: “Danny played on so many of the albums I loved and which influenced me.”

Another comment read: “His bass lines shall live on ❤️🔥”  

A fan chimed in: “Very sad and sorry to read this news. Honoured to have the memories of the times that I spent in his company. Rest well guv'nor.” 

A post shared by Danny Thompson (@therealdannythompson)

Thompson first picked up the bass at age 16, famously keeping a sign in his room reminding him to “practice.” His career spanned multiple genres, blending jazz, blues, and folk. He rose to prominence as a founding member of Pentangle, one of the most influential folk-jazz groups of the 1960s.

Throughout his career, Thompson collaborated with an extraordinary range of artists, from jazz greats such as Tubby Hayes and Stan Tracey to folk icons like Nick Drake and John Martyn. He also collaborated with Kate Bush and even performed with Roy Orbison, “when The Beatles were still the opening act.”

A post shared by PAOLO BRILLO (@paolobrillo)

In a 2023 interview with Louder Sound, Thompson reflected on his open-minded approach to music. “I never say I'm not going to play with someone because they're working in a different kind of music to me. I'll always have a play, and it's that which has led to all kinds of different things.”

A post shared by Stephen Hunt (@huntstephen23)

Though he was never comfortable with accolades, Thompson's impact was recognized in 2007 when he received the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards Lifetime Achievement honor.

Beyond his vast discography and countless collaborations, Thompson leaves behind a legacy as one of the most versatile and admired bass players of his time. His music transcended boundaries, blending jazz, folk, and popular music in innovative ways.

He is survived by his wife, Sylvia, and his son, Dan Junior. “Danny was a force of nature,” his team wrote. “He will be sorely missed.”

Since its inception way back in 2012 (truly a different time), the “V/H/S” horror anthology series has delivered a reliable selection of thrills and chills with only slightly truncated regularity (the first three films arrived in 2012, 2013, and 2014, before putting a pause on the whole caboodle, only to come roaring back in 2021 and banging out entry out a year). And while the series has often been released in the prime of spooky time (read: October), the eighth entry into the franchise is now going full Halloween.

Naturally, it's entitled “V/H/S/Halloween,” and the latest feature promises all sorts of holiday-appropriate tricks and treats. Per its official synopsis: “A collection of Halloween-themed videotapes unleashes a series of twisted, blood-soaked tales, turning trick-or-treat into a struggle for survival.”

Related Stories The 2025 — 2026 Film Awards Calendar Stretches Out the Season ‘Dead of Winter' Review: Emma Thompson Goes ‘Fargo' Mode in a Fun and Frigid Minnesotan Thriller 

The film just had its world premiere at Fantastic Fest over the weekend, and early reviews have been largely positive, hailing its combination of laugh-out-loud jokes and gory scares. Per usual, the anthology film is built on found-footage conceits, offering up five horror shorts and sixth that serves as both the frame for the entire endeavor and its own chilling entry. 

 










On offer this time around: stories about the evils of diet soda, suburban moms, crime scenes, Halloween candy, video stores, and even a cursed LP. In other words, it's got it all. 

The film's six segments include “Diet Phantasma” directed by Bryan M. Ferguson, “Fun Size” directed by Casper Kelly, “Home Haunt” directed by Micheline Pitt-Norman & R.H. Norman, “Kidprint” directed by Alex Ross Perry, “Ut Supra Sic Infra” directed by Paco Plaza, and “Coochie Coochie Coo” directed by Anna Zlokovic.

The full trailer for “V/H/S/Halloween” leans way into its perfectly calibrated scary setting, but for all the obviously dark stuff this new look shows off (dark spaces, bone-crunching sound effects, and what is clearly a super evil crime scene), it's the specific Halloween stuff that really pops. Haven't you ever thought how odd it is that we go to strangers' houses one night a year to ask them to give our children candy? Or that we pay money for people to jump out at us in confined spaces? Halloween, naturally scary, but also naturally really weird.

Rihanna and A$AP Rocky have welcomed their third child, Rocki Irish Mayers.


	In an Instagram post Wednesday, Sept. 24, the pop star confirmed that she gave birth earlier this month, on Sept. 13. Rihanna shared a photo of herself with the baby girl, as well as a picture of what appear to be two baby-sized boxing gloves.

	Rihanna and Rocky welcomed their first son, RZA, in 2022, while their second son, Riot, was born in 2023. Rihanna revealed she was pregnant with their third child back in May, making a fashionably late entrance at the Met Gala in a two-piece Miu Miu outfit that emphasized her baby bump.

	The announcement happens to come one day after Elle published an A$AP Rocky cover story, in which he expressed his desire for a baby girl. “I hope it's a girl. I really do. We're praying for a girl,” he said. “Our first time, we wanted to know the sex of the baby. The second time, we didn't want to know. Third time, we don't want to know until, you know. I feel like it's going to be a girl. This pregnancy is so different from the other two. You can tell from the experience. I hope it's a baby girl, man. I need that.”

	











	In an April 2024 chat with Interview Magazine, Rihanna was asked how many more children she wanted. She replied: “As many as God wants me to have.” When asked if it was more than two, she said, “I don't know what God wants, but I would go for more than two. I would try for my girl. But of course if it's another boy, it's another boy.”

Jimmy Kimmel made his return to late-night on Tuesday, a week after Disney and ABC made the call to pull Jimmy Kimmel Live! from the air, citing the host's comments about the right-wing response to Charlie Kirk's death. Media companies Sinclair and Nexstar are continuing to preempt the series. Still, while it didn't air on their ABC-affiliate channels last night, Kimmel's 30-minute monologue has racked up more than 16 million views in the past 12 hours on YouTube.


	The views are continuing to climb, officially making the video his most-viewed YouTube upload from Jimmy Kimmel Live! since the host sat down with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and 50 Cent last year. That clip also had 16 million views.


	“Maybe most of all, I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” Kimmel said in his emotional monologue. “People I never would have imagined, like Ben Shapiro, Clay Travis, Candace Owens, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul. Even my old pal Ted Cruz.… Even though I don't agree with many of those people on most subjects — some of the things they say even make me want to throw up — it takes courage for them to speak out against this administration, and they did, and they deserve credit for it.”

	











	This throws a wrench into the Trump administration's plans. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr claimed that Kimmel attempted to push the narrative that Kirk's shooter “was somehow a MAGA or Republican-motivated person,” again calling it “sick,” in an effort to have the show pulled.

	Donald Trump himself threw something of a fit about Kimmel's return. In a rant on Truth Social, he declaring that he intends to sue ABC for bringing the show back. “I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back,” Trump wrote. “The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‘talent' was never there.”

	He added: “He is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers! Let Jimmy Kimmel rot in his bad Ratings.”

	Trump is referencing the settlement in which Paramount agreed to pay $16 million in donations to the future Trump Library after he filed a lawsuit against 60 Minutes, objecting to an interview with Kamala Harris that was not edited to his liking. Around the same time, Paramount was vying for federal approval of an $8 billion merger with Skydance, which had been in limbo for some time.


	When Stephen Colbert referred to the deal as a “big fat bribe,” Paramount suddenly announced it was ending The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, despite the show's top-ranking ratings. Maybe Trump assumed the same would happen to Kimmel. However, if more than 11 million people are willing to tune in online as well, his fight can't be with the networks. Is he going to sue YouTube next? That would make for a great Jimmy Kimmel Live! segment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=strange+science","The strange science project that reshaped pop vocals","https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/homer-dudley-weird-way-a-1930s-science-project-transformed-modern-pop-music/","Wed, 24 Sep 2025 23:00:00 GMT","

Even if you don't fully understand what it is, you've probably heard the robotic voice effect of a vocoder on a pop hit, and the questions might start rattling around in your head, wondering exactly how it's made.

To be fair, it's a very good question, and you only need three components in order for one to function properly: a carrier, a synthesiser and a modulator. The vocoder then reshapes the voice that is used as input and applies it to the synth, which then goes on to make alterations to the pitch. You can speak or sing into the vocoder, and it'll do all of the rest of the hard work for you, turning a simple and potentially tuneless vocal input into a chord or sliding scale.

However, the real question is how someone even came up with the concept of making the instrument in the first place, and the key here is to forget that it's even an instrument at all. In fact, its creator, Homer Dudley, an electronic engineer from the US, designed it in the 1930s as a means of transmitting speech over long distances, with the goal of sending spoken messages across the Atlantic for communication between the US and Europe. 

The issue with this was that the amount of data that needed to be transferred was too much for any machine in this period to process, so what the vocoder did was decode it and reconstruct it at the receiving end through robotic speech. The name ‘vocoder', or ‘voder', as it was originally known, is a portmanteau of ‘vocal decoder', and this is how Dudley intended for it to be used, so how did it end up becoming a device that is so commonplace in popular music?

With the vocoder, you can use it as a primary carrier of melody in a song due to how the pitch is changeable with simple inputs, but at the same time, it can be used to create an additional harmonic layer on an existing vocal, whether human or synthesised. Because of its robotic and futuristic sound, it has ended up being prominent in electronic music, or any form of popular music that specifically looks to evoke the feeling of being futuristic or alien.

While early synth pioneers such as Robert Moog and Bruce Haack were among the first to develop and utilise vocoders in a musical capacity as early as the late 1960s, it would eventually get picked up by mainstream artists, with Sly & the Family Stone and Stevie Wonder becoming some of the earliest artists to discover its usability in a musical context. 

Jump forward to the 1990s, and French house duo Daft Punk began using it even more frequently, with it being front and centre in songs such as ‘Around the World' and ‘Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger', where a human voice is replicated by a more modernised version of Dudley's machine.

There have, of course, been other inventions developed in the years since which produce a robotic effect that can be used to alter human vocals, with the talk box and vocal harmoniser often being confused for a vocoder when used in songs, but the fascinating thing about the vocoder remains that it was never intended for use in music, it just happened to be perfect for it. Dudley's science project ended up successfully transmitting messages as he had wished, and as a fortuitous byproduct of that, he changed pop music forever.","{'href': 'https://faroutmagazine.co.uk', 'title': 'Far Out Magazine'}","other"

Russian tech startup Neiry has become the first in the world to insert neuro-implants into cow brains to increase milk yield when all other methods are exhausted.

Neiry announced its intention to begin testing its neuro-implants on live cows back in April. Last month, its specialists performed surgeries on five cows to fit them with a stimulator attached to the back of the head and electrodes that penetrate deep into the brain. With the help of these devices, they hope to reach areas responsible for appetite, stress, and reproductive function, and stimulate them through electric impulses. The first tests were performed in Russia's Sverdlovsk region, and so far, the results are very encouraging.

According to Neiry investor Alexey Mariza, in many dairy cow farms, all measures to increase production have already been implemented, so radically new approaches like neuro-implant brain stimulation have the potential to significantly disrupt the dairy production industry and provide a significant competitive advantage.

According to a recent report by the Russian news agency Ria Novosti, Neiry specialists performed surgeries on five cows to fit them with special neuro-implants. The cows were conscious during the implantation process, survived the procedure without any noticeable side effects, and returned to the production cycle. Although the company has yet to release official data on the effects of the implants on milk production, Neiry claims that the cows' milk production improved.

Scientists are currently working on selecting the optimal stimulation program depending on the area they are trying to stimulate: for example, when a cow's appetite decreases, the system selects the appropriate neuromodulation mode for recovery. Neiry admits they still have work to do to improve their neuro-implants, but the Russian company considers they already work well enough to be sold commercially in the near future.

Not everyone is impressed with Neiry's cow brain neuro-implants. For example, Andrey Neduzhko, General Director of the Steppe agricultural holding, believes the implants carry unnecessary risks for the animals and are unprofitable because of their exorbitant price. However, Neiry claims that it has already identified ways of significantly lowering the prices of its products, one of which involves carrying out the implantation in a proprietary mobile operating room.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon has stepped back from the policy that requires all troops to get the flu shot every year by introducing exemptions for reservists and proclaiming that the shot is only necessary in some circumstances for all service members, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press.

The memo, written by Deputy Defense Secretary Steve Feinberg on May 29 and sent to all the military services, says reserve troops now will need to be on active duty for 30 days or more before being required to get an annual flu shot. It also says the military will no longer be paying for reservists or National Guard members to get the vaccine on their own time.

News of the policy change, which has not been publicly announced by the Pentagon, comes as the Trump administration and its advisers have suggested changes to other vaccination guidance. An influential immunization panel that the administration updated to include anti-vaccine figures decided to not recommend the COVID-19 shot to anyone, while President Donald Trump used his platform to promote unproven and, in some cases, discredited ties between the pain reliever Tylenol, vaccines and autism.

At the Pentagon, the flu shot memo declared that “going forward, the Department will conserve its resources by requiring seasonal flu vaccination for Service members only when doing so most directly contributes to readiness.” However, the document is not clear about the changes because it later says the annual requirement for active-duty troops is still in effect.

While the memo was quietly sent months ago, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth drew attention to it Wednesday when he reposted a comment from an anonymous account that claimed they “won't be forced to get a flu shot this fall for the privilege of serving my state and country in the National Guard.”




Officials in Hegseth's office did not answer questions on the conflicting nature of the memo or comment on the post he amplified.

The Trump administration also has offered back pay to former service members who refused the COVID-19 vaccine and were kicked out of the military under the Biden administration. Those who declined the vaccination have been able to return to service since 2023, but only 113 of the more than 8,000 discharged service members had chosen to do so. 

The back pay offer was intended to encourage more to reenlist but met with limited success. Two months later, Pentagon officials said only 13 people — all Army soldiers — had rejoined the military.
