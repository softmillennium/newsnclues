                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Learner Tien, Dino Prizmic and Shang Juncheng all earned victories on the ATP Tour last week in Hangzhou and Chengdu, respectively, increasing their chances of playing at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, held from 17-21 December in Jeddah. Tien cemented his third-placed position in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah with a quarter-final run at the ATP 250 hard-court event in Hangzhou. The 19-year-old American defeated Mariano Navone and Giulio Zeppieri before he lost to eventual finalist Valentin Royer. Tien is hoping to make his second appearance at the 20-and-under event after reaching the title match last year. The Croatian, who has lifted two ATP Challenger Tour trophies in 2025, defeated Cincinnati semi-finalist Terence Atmane and then pushed Top 10 star Lorenzo Musetti to three sets in the second round. Prizmic is aiming to make his debut in Jeddah. China's Shang continued his comeback from injury with a first-round win against Zizou Bergs in Chengdu. Shang is 18th in the Live Race To Jeddah and will need a couple of deep runs in the next eight weeks to move into qualification contention. This week, he is playing at the ATP 500 event in Beijing and opens against Arthur Cazaux.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner appears to be making good on his promise to become more unpredictable on the tennis court court, the former world No. 1 discussing changes to his practice repertoire in the wake of a 2025 US Open final defeat to Carlos Alcaraz.‚ÄúWe've been reflecting a lot to that final,‚Äù Sinner said in a pre-tournament press conference at this week's China Open.

It was a stark admission from the 24-year-old Italian who otherwise enjoyed a remarkable follow-up to his breakthrough 2024 season, winning two more Grand Slam trophies‚Äîincluding a first Wimbledon title over Alcaraz‚Äîand reaching the final of all four major tournaments in 2025. He also maintained a 65-week stretch atop the ATP rankings despite missing three months of tournaments due to a suspension for an anti-doping rule violation incurred last spring.Still, Sinner feels there's room for improvement, particularly against Alcaraz, who has become primary rival and leads their head-to-head, 9-5.‚ÄúI'm trying to be more prepared for the next match what I will play against him,‚Äù Sinner said in New York. ‚ÄúIt also, I feel like, depends how you arrive to play against Carlos.

Sinner is the top seed in Beijing, as Alcaraz has opted not to defend his title and instead compete at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships in Tokyo. The Italian will open against Marin Cilic in the first round.Might fans see a new Sinner on court against the 2014 US Open champion?‚ÄúIt's just a question of time,‚Äù Sinner said of his tactical tweaks. I don't know how much I'm able to do it on actual match court because one thing is practice and one thing is match. It's great to work on something new, then we see how this ends up. One step in front is always better than two steps back. Might fans see a new Sinner on court against the 2014 US Open champion?‚ÄúIt's just a question of time,‚Äù Sinner said of his tactical tweaks.
