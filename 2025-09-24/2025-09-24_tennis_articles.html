                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At the age of 36, Zhang Shuai is thriving on court and embracing her role as a "tennis auntie" to the younger generation. After Zhang Shuai thrilled the Diamond Court crowd with a 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 comeback win over qualifier Anastasia Zakharova in the China Open first round, the home favorite was understandably upbeat. "I'm still very exciting on the court, very exciting back to the home tournament, very exciting play on Diamond Court," the 36-year-old said. The wide array of dumplings and other delicacies in the player restaurant has been a welcome change. Usually, Zhang's search for a satisfying meal means bypassing tournament food -- “similar because so healthy,” as she put it -- in favor of Chinese eateries worldwide. In Beijing, she's been able to feast. "From qualies to the final, you have to stay there three weeks in the Grand Slam. Here, oh my God, before the match, I eat a big dinner. During the match, even three set, I still feeling full so I have full energy. "Very important for player what you eat. Fueled by good food, Zhang's win over Zakharova ("We both play really fast and early -- that's the great tennis, I like very much the tennis like this") was a full-circle moment for her. This time last year, she memorably snapped a 24-match losing streak, and went all the way to the quarterfinals -- a result that has helped re-establish her on tour, with a singles ranking of No. That experience is one of many that mean Zhang is perfectly placed to be a mentor to younger Chinese up-and-coming talents -- the tennis version of the quintessential auntie figure in Asian culture. Her role as an elder of the sport is one she embraces. "It just proves that I've been playing a long time." That's why, when she sees young players struggle, Zhang is empathetic. "When I see them, they're always full of panic, have a panicked face," she said. I will be able to maintain a calm mindset. You cannot force this level of calm on a very young player. You talk to those people when they start the journey. Of course, it will be quite different when they finish the journey. China's quarterfinal loss to Italy at last week's Billie Jean King Cup Finals was one occasion on which Zhang had to put her best pep talks into practise. On home soil, both Yuan Yue and Wang Xinyu both led their singles rubbers by a set and a break, only to be reeled in by Elisabetta Cocciaretto and Jasmine Paolini respectively. A post shared by Billie Jean King Cup (@billiejeankingcup) "After the BJK Cup, two girls were blaming themselves," Zhang said. Every success is based on rounds of failures.' I tell them, 'You're great, you did a good job. You are just one step away from victory. It was easy in the quarterfinals and semifinals. Sometimes when I finish a match, I just forget those moments because there's no way for you to return to that moment. What we can do is to make tomorrow better." That's a lesson directly taken from Zhang's own ups and downs. Twelve months ago, she was considering retirement. Now, the "motivation for battle" is burning strongly again, and she can't envisage stopping. "That's why I always talking to all the girls, 'You much better than you thought. At the age of 36, Zhang Shuai is thriving on court and embracing her role as a "tennis auntie" to the younger generation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Learner Tien, Dino Prizmic and Shang Juncheng all earned victories on the ATP Tour last week in Hangzhou and Chengdu, respectively, increasing their chances of playing at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, held from 17-21 December in Jeddah. Tien cemented his third-placed position in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah with a quarter-final run at the ATP 250 hard-court event in Hangzhou. The 19-year-old American defeated Mariano Navone and Giulio Zeppieri before he lost to eventual finalist Valentin Royer. Tien is hoping to make his second appearance at the 20-and-under event after reaching the title match last year. The Croatian, who has lifted two ATP Challenger Tour trophies in 2025, defeated Cincinnati semi-finalist Terence Atmane and then pushed Top 10 star Lorenzo Musetti to three sets in the second round. Prizmic is aiming to make his debut in Jeddah. China's Shang continued his comeback from injury with a first-round win against Zizou Bergs in Chengdu. Shang is 18th in the Live Race To Jeddah and will need a couple of deep runs in the next eight weeks to move into qualification contention. This week, he is playing at the ATP 500 event in Beijing and opens against Arthur Cazaux.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner appears to be making good on his promise to become more unpredictable on the tennis court court, the former world No. 1 discussing changes to his practice repertoire in the wake of a 2025 US Open final defeat to Carlos Alcaraz.“We've been reflecting a lot to that final,” Sinner said in a pre-tournament press conference at this week's China Open.

It was a stark admission from the 24-year-old Italian who otherwise enjoyed a remarkable follow-up to his breakthrough 2024 season, winning two more Grand Slam trophies—including a first Wimbledon title over Alcaraz—and reaching the final of all four major tournaments in 2025. He also maintained a 65-week stretch atop the ATP rankings despite missing three months of tournaments due to a suspension for an anti-doping rule violation incurred last spring.Still, Sinner feels there's room for improvement, particularly against Alcaraz, who has become primary rival and leads their head-to-head, 9-5.“I'm trying to be more prepared for the next match what I will play against him,” Sinner said in New York. “It also, I feel like, depends how you arrive to play against Carlos.

Sinner is the top seed in Beijing, as Alcaraz has opted not to defend his title and instead compete at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships in Tokyo. The Italian will open against Marin Cilic in the first round.Might fans see a new Sinner on court against the 2014 US Open champion?“It's just a question of time,” Sinner said of his tactical tweaks. I don't know how much I'm able to do it on actual match court because one thing is practice and one thing is match. It's great to work on something new, then we see how this ends up. One step in front is always better than two steps back. Might fans see a new Sinner on court against the 2014 US Open champion?“It's just a question of time,” Sinner said of his tactical tweaks.
