                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The partnership will benefit 21 schools and hundreds of students, with support from FIFA and local soccer clubs aimed at helping young athletes elevate their game. Student athletes gathered Tuesday at the South Philly Super Site to celebrate the announcement, just steps from Lincoln Financial Field, where World Cup matches will be held. "I think all of us collectively, we're just really excited for the World Cup, really excited to see the teams we support play together," said Angel Oburu, an 11th grader at Science Leadership Academy at Beeber. Fatiamh Iprahiam, a 9th grader at SLA Beeber, added, "I'm so excited for the World Cup, and I'm so excited to hopefully meet my favorite player. Students from SLA Beeber expressed particular excitement about a new soccer field being built at their school, along with one at Olney High School. "It's beneficial for me because we get a field to train on, so we can win more games," said Sally Doumbia, a 10th grader at SLA Beeber. Oburu added, "I definitely feel like when we get the field, it's going to improve all of our stamina, our speed, how fast we are on the field, how we play - because getting on SEPTA is a really hard issue." "Joy is one of the core values in our five-year aggressive strategic plan entitled Accelerate Philly," Watlington said. "And we expect to have lots of joy over the next year." Students interested in joining a team still have time to participate by attending practice and showcasing their skills.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a surprising development, FIFA president Gianni Infantino met in New York with Alejandro Domínguez, head of CONMEBOL, to evaluate the possibility of expanding the 2030 FIFA World Cup from the already expanded 48-team format (set for 2026) to a groundbreaking 64 national teams. The tournament, which will be hosted primarily by Spain, Portugal, and Morocco, also includes special group-stage matches in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay to honor the centennial of the first World Cup held in Montevideo in 1930. The soccer discussion was described as “historic” by Domínguez, who stressed the ambition of making World Cup 2030 a landmark edition. According to reports from La Nación, it was Infantino himself who pushed for the meeting and strongly supports the idea of expansion. But taking the leap to 64 would be unprecedented, creating a tournament with 128 matches, twice as many as the 64 games played from 1998 to 2022. Still, Infantino has been traveling extensively, including a recent visit to Morocco and talks with leaders in Asia and Africa, looking to build consensus for the plan. If approved, the 2030 World Cup would feature 16 groups of four teams each. The top two teams from every group would move on to the knockout stage, creating a Round of 32. From there, the competition would follow the same elimination model familiar to fans, but with more matches and potentially higher logistical challenges. Messi's Argentina vs Mexico in Las Vegas? Uruguay and Paraguay would also host group games, with Paraguay even building a new stadium to be ready in time for the tournament. If FIFA moves forward, the 2030 World Cup would not only celebrate 100 years of history but also mark a new era where global inclusivity and commercial opportunity redefine the tournament. Includes: every MLS game and Leagues Cup The FIFA U-20 World Cup in Chile will debut Football Video Support (FVS), a simplified and lower-cost alternative to VAR. Pierluigi Collina has proposed ending follow-up chances on penalties, a change that could take effect after the 2026 World Cup in North America.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea have been informed that a Real Madrid superstar could now be tempted to join them. Enzo Maresca's side edged past League One minnows Lincoln City by the skin of their teeth on Tuesday night, despite fielding a largely strong side including a host of senior stars. Rob Street's deserved Lincoln opener just before half-time threatened to knock Chelsea out of the Carabao Cup in very early and humbling fashion, but Maresca was rescued by an excellent strike from Tyrique George and a second goal from summer signing Facundo Buonanotte just minutes later. Cole Palmer's reoccurring groin problem is a major worry for Chelsea given just how reliant they currently are on the England star's undoubted match-winning quality, with their botched deal for attacking midfield alternative Xavi Simons threatening to haunt Maresca. Chelsea are expected to go back in for Mike Maignan on a potential pre-contract after failing to strike a deal in the summer, while the Blues are also actively looking at central defensive options. Even with their glaring defensive needs, journalist Graeme Bailey has now told TBR Football that an audacious move for Real Madrid superstar Vinícius Jr is on the cards for 2026. The Brazil international kissed Real's badge after his goal in their 4-1 La Liga win over Levante on Tuesday, but behind-closed-doors, things are proving far more complicated. There is apparent "frustration" aimed at Alonso over Vinicius' role in the squad, and talks over a new deal have stalled due to extortionate wage demands as his contract ticks down towards expiry in 2027. Real have apparently been clear to the 25-year-old - agree a new contract by next summer or be sold. According to Bailey, Chelsea have been informed that Vinicius could be open to a Premier League move if they give him the opportunity, and sources are "insisting" that the winger's exit is indeed a possibility. “Florentino Perez loves Vinicius Junior but there are concerns within the club about whether he is going to sign this new deal," Bailey said. “It is hard to imagine Vinicius not being at Madrid but sources are insisting this possibility. He has commanded a mammoth price tag in recent years, but by the time next summer rolls around, Vinicius will have just one year remaining on his deal. In terms of whether Chelsea should capitalise on this, Vinicius is one of those special players you build a team around, and the South American could help to ease the burden on Palmer's shoulders as Maresca's standout creative force.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seven games into the new season, Chelsea are not where they would want to be. The Blues sit sixth in the Premier League table, having won just two of their opening five league games. Chelsea were one of only two Premier League clubs, alongside Manchester City, who were present at FIFA's revamped Club Wold Cup tournament in the USA over the summer. It meant that while the other 18 Premier League clubs, including the Blues' competitors such as Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham were able to have at least six weeks off, Enzo Maresca and his players were only able to take two weeks off after the tournament, and only returned to training a couple of weeks before the Premier League started. That strain has been shown by Chelsea's early injuries. Levi Colwill picked up an ACL injury only days after Chelsea began training for the new season. The English centre-half played 38 games for Chelsea last term, then flew out with England for a camp and two games, before going straight to the FIFA tournament and playing five games there. Cole Palmer, Chelsea's best and most important player, has had issues with a groin injury since the season began. The forward started the opening league game against Crystal Palace, before missing two games and returning against Brentford. He played in that game and against Bayern Munich in the Champions League, but was taken off after 20 minutes against Manchester United because of the persistent problem. Palmer played 52 times for Chelsea last campaign, including the Club World Cup. It cannot be purely coincidental that Colwill and Palmer – two players who played among the most minutes in the squad – have now picked up serious injuries. Enzo Maresca and Cole Palmer (Photo by Alex Livesey/Getty Images) He scored 18 goals and registered 13 assists last term. Dario Essugo, Benoit Badiashile, Romeo Lavia and Liam Delap are all players who played in the summer tournament and now find themselves injured. Despite clear issues that have arisen as a result of the heavy workload on the players, not all of Chelsea's shortcomings can be attributed to that. Crystal Palace, West Ham, Fulham and Brentford as the first four league games. To take eight points from those games is a disappointment. Chelsea would have expected to beat Palace at home, and they would also expect to beat 17th place Brentford, who have lost their two best players and their manager. The Brentford game was four days before Chelsea's trip to the Allianz Arena, and Enzo Maresca opted for an experimental side. Fans were curious as to why Maresca chose to give two players their full debuts, Buonanotte and Hato, a decision which backfired. And things seem to have gone downhill since that last minute equaliser that Brentford's Fabio Carvalho inflicted on them. Robert Sanchez's daft decision to take out Bryan Mbeumo in the fifth minute and reduce the Blues to ten men was costly, but so were Maresca's ensuing decisions. Palmer was an enforced one, but Estevao and Pedro Neto were also taken off. Three forward players left the pitch, and no forward players came on, leaving only one attacker, Joao Pedro, on the pitch. Fans were baffled at Maresca's defensive substitutions, and United scored twice before the end of the first half anyway. While that might be true, part of a manager's job is to be reactive to in-game events. After three games without a win and in need of some positivity, a Carabao Cup game against League One side Lincoln City seemed timely. Maresca fielded a fairly strong side with several regulars starting. Chelsea's transfer strategy is something that predates Maresca and was implemented when Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital took control of the club in May 2022. Chelsea had an ageing squad and players like Jorginho, Cesar Azpilicueta, Antonio Rudiger and many others needed replacing. There was also a period of grace for the new owners and sporting directors. They had to get their feet under the table and work things out. Failed transfers like Mykhailo Mudryk, Joao Felix, Axel Disasi, Badiashile and others were to be anticipated. Now the ownership have been in place for three years and spent £1.5 billion. While they have had some success, winning the Conference League, Club World Cup and qualifying for the Champions League last season, fans expect a Premier League title challenging team. Chelsea winger Alejandro Garnacho (Photo by Alex Pantling/Getty Images) But he is not currently, and so does not make a massive impact on Chelsea's hopes in the immediate future. After Colwill got injured, Maresca emphasised the need for a new centre-back signing. So is it any surprise that with mounting injuries and young players such as Gittens and Hato who do not seem ready, as yet, for the top level of the Premier League, Chelsea are having a mixed season so far? A domestic cup win would help matters but overall, there has to be clear signs of progress towards become a title contending team. The transfer strategy has to change, that is clear.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fifa's official position is that it will discuss World Cup expansion with all its stakeholders and that it is duty-bound to consider proposals raised at council. But behind the scenes there is scepticism about whether expanding the tournament to 64 teams is a viable proposition. Any decision to expand the World Cup would be taken by Fifa Council, which meets in Zurich next month, but that is not on the agenda. “Gianni would not get that vote through Council even if he wanted to,” a Fifa source said. There'd be too many uncompetitive matches and it would risk damaging the business model.” Conmebol would be the major beneficiaries of another expansion and sources with knowledge of Tuesday's meeting disclosed that Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina claimed to have the capability to host all of the group stage. Expansion to 64 teams would mean more than 30% of Fifa's 211 member associations would take part, as well as putting all 10 Conmebol in the frame to qualify, up from six direct qualifiers next year, plus the possibility of an extra place via an inter-confederation playoff. The 64-team idea was first presented at Fifa Council last April, but prompted an immediate backlash. The Concacaf president, Victor Montagliani, said: “They [Fifa] can study all they want, but it just doesn't feel right.” Significantly, both men are Fifa vice-presidents. Fifa is also facing calls from leading European clubs to expand the Club World Cup from 32 teams in 2029 due to the huge prize and appearance money on offer. Staging the competition every two years is also being considered. A 64-team World Cup would feature 128 matches, double the number played at the most recent tournament in Qatar three years ago and 24 more than next year. Any decision to expand the World Cup would be taken by Fifa's Council, which meets in Zurich next month, although the issue is not thought to be on the agenda.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea have released the team's 2025/26 squad photo as they showcased the UEFA Conference League and FIFA Club World Cup trophies. It has been a mixed start to the season for Chelsea, who are currently sixth in the Premier League table with two wins and a loss from their opening five games. Head coach Enzo Maresca sits in the middle, of course, alongside his primary assistant and former Chelsea goalkeeper Willy Caballero. It is also great to see Levi Colwill, who is still recovering from a long-term anterior cruciate ligament injury, again. When speaking recently about his squad and Chelsea's Premier League title hopes, Maresca insisted that his team has been improving and closing the gap to the leading teams. The Blues are still in contention to compete for four trophies this season, including the Carabao Cup, in which they have just reached the fourth round after beating Lincoln City on Tuesday. While in the Champions League, Chelsea's return to the competition was unfortunately marked with a defeat to Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich. Maresca's men will be able to bounce back with a win as they host Benfica in the Champions League at Stamford Bridge next week. But before that, the next challenge is Brighton in a Premier League bout on Saturday. Gerry Crisandy is a freelance writer who has covered Chelsea for many years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The FIFA World Cup 2026 is poised to be the largest of its kind, expanding from 32 teams to 48, with matches scheduled to be played across the North American continent. However, the sheer size of this football tournament casts a dark shadow on the environment, even threatening livelihoods. Sponsorship deals with fossil fuel companies, extensive air travel, suppression of protests from local communities, and construction on forests all set the 2026 iteration to be the one with the highest carbon footprint yet. A new report by Scientists for Global Responsibility, “FIFA's Climate Blind Spot: The Men's World Cup in a Warming World,” finds that the expansion of the tournament from 32 to 48 teams will lead to a significant increase in emissions for the 2026, 2030, and 2034 iterations of the event — particularly due to air transport for teams, staff, and fans. The Spanish-led 2030 iteration will lead to 6.1 million tCO2e, and the 2034 Finals in Saudi Arabia will be responsible for 8.6 million tCO2e. FIFA has not had the best track record in staying aligned with climate strategies. But the credibility of FIFA's previous claims of carbon neutrality at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar has already been questioned by multiple groups. The Swiss Commission for Fairness, based in Zurich, also reported that the organization was “not able to provide proof that the claims were accurate” and “did not set out a plan to define how it will further offset emissions”. FIFA's case becomes even more questionable considering notable sponsors of the event include airline and oil companies such as Qatar Airways and Aramco. “How is it possible that they have a first-class stadium, and next to it, a town that's dead?” While the event will use existing venues, instead of requiring the construction of newer ones, preparations and expansions continue to hurt local communities. People living in areas surrounding the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City say development plans for the area will worsen the water supply and threaten green spaces. The constitution states that in the case of constructing on Indigenous land, authorities must legally consult local communities and leaders, such as Ramírez. There are even plans to turn a 5,000-square-meter forest area inside Santa Úrsula into a construction site. “Why do they have to build it here? Televisa, a company that partly owns the Azteca stadium, privatized a well in the area in 2018, further worsening the condition, as the Santa Úrsula community protests that this contract was illegal and has contributed to exploitation. What are the community going to see? To counteract these effects, the report suggests that FIFA: Maaz is pursuing a Master's in Philosophy and Computer Science at the University of Bayreuth and has professional experience in the tech industry. He is interested in technology, climate change, decolonization, and culture, and is currently working on a literary project exploring South Asia's migration history.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dembélé, the new king of football The Frenchman lifted the Champions League, Ligue 1, French Cup and French Super Cup, while scoring 35 goals and adding 16 assists. Numbers that finally established him as the undisputed leader he had long been expected to become. The vote confirmed what many anticipated: Dembélé's maturity placed him above everyone else, even one of the brightest young stars on the planet. On the other side stood Lamine Yamal, the 18-year-old prodigy who dreamed of becoming the youngest Ballon d'Or winner in history. His silence after the ceremony reflected the blow of hearing Dembélé's name instead of his. Although he was recognized with the 2025 Kopa Trophy as the world's best young player, Yamal had prepared a private celebration in Paris with family and friends that never came to be. His defeat left a bittersweet taste: a secure future, but still without the ultimate glory. On October 1, Yamal's Barcelona will visit Dembélé's PSG in the second matchday of the continental tournament. It will be a clash loaded with intrigue: the new Ballon d'Or holder against the player many believe is destined to dominate the next decade.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alex Morgan is honored and has her No. DEL MAR, Calif. -- One year ago, after Alex Morgan announced to the world in a video that she was pregnant and retiring with almost immediate effect, she sat in her car alone and cried. Now I'm going to enjoy it," she told ESPN in a sit-down interview. Morgan's 15-year career -- which included two World Cup titles, an Olympic gold medal and multiple major club trophies -- ended abruptly, but she'd already been working for years on her next chapter to come in the world of business. She grew to such fame that she transcended the sport, signing deals with Coca-Cola and Nike, appearing in commercials with NBA star LeBron James and even receiving her own custom Barbie. Now, Morgan is a minority investor in San Diego Wave FC, the last team she played for, along with other investments including the new 3-on-3 women's basketball league, Unrivaled. In 2019, in the prime of her career, she co-founded the content brand Togethxr with fellow athletes and Olympic gold medalists Sue Bird, Simone Manuel and Chloe Kim. I already had so many different things in motion -- it wasn't like figuring the next thing out as one door closed and the next door opened. I was juggling a lot of things at once and trying to learn a lot of new things off the field." - Ranking the greatest moments of Alex Morgan's career - NWSL transfer grades: USWNT moves and a record deal - NWSL MVP Tracker 4.0: The best players ranked Morgan's hands-on experience at the highest level of sport is why other businesswomen have invested in her. Olivia Walton, the founder of Ingeborg Investments -- which focuses on women-led, early-stage startups -- met Morgan at a conference for women in venture capital. The two shared a vision "from the beginning," said Walton, who joined Togethxr as an investor earlier this year. Morgan's achievements as a player were part of the selling point to Walton. "Alex approaches business the same way she approaches competition -- with curiosity, intensity, and purpose," Walton told ESPN via email. Togethxr's primary business is branded studio content, including films focused on women athletes. The company said it was profitable last year and claimed it saw a large increase in revenue (to $30 million) and valuation. "Few people can walk into a room and be listened to equally by players, sponsors, and investors like Alex can." That is high praise for someone whose business experience has been, by Morgan's own admission, learning as she goes. Morgan studied political economics at Cal-Berkeley, but she was becoming a household name with the USWNT before she even graduated college -- where she "was very head down, driven to be the best soccer player I could possibly be." Alex Morgan reacts to her first goal for the USWNT in a friendly vs. China. For one, she is now a mom of two, telling ESPN that she tries to find balance in simple ways like stepping out to take a walk. Through Trybe Ventures, the investment arm she has with her husband, Servando Carrasco, she also has a stake in roughly two dozen companies ranging from media to sports technology. Among their other investments are the Los Angeles Golf Club in TGL, and Classic Football Shirts, a company focused on nostalgic soccer kits. Dan Levy, who has been Morgan's agent since she first became a professional soccer player, said it's rare to find an athlete who can successfully navigate business ventures in the prime of their career. "A lot of athletes struggle with trying to figure out how to manage their career and be the best at what they do on the field, on the court, and at the same time, put in the time, effort, and work to build their business outside of it," he told Variety recently. Today, Morgan leans on those athlete experiences -- and the expertise of partners like Walton -- to sharpen herself as a businessperson. "I'm learning in this new space every single day," Morgan said. "It's very humbling and it's also really challenging in a lot of ways -- in a good way, in the way that I was challenged on the soccer field every day. Morgan made a quick transition from player to team owner for the Wave, retiring last September and joining the team as an investor in May. Last year, amid turmoil for the Wave on and off the field that included allegations from former employees of a toxic work environment, Morgan prominently spoke as an active player, tweeting "it is clear that there is so much work to be done." Asked what has changed with the club in just over a year and why she invested, Morgan said that one of the reasons she wanted to invest is to provide feedback from the perspective of a former player. Twenty-four-year-old defender Kennedy Wesley said after the Wave retired Morgan's No. Morgan was more than just a great player who scored 123 international goals. She was a central figure in the USWNT's fight against the U.S. Soccer Federation for equal pay, which it achieved via settlement in 2022 after a six-year fight. Morgan said the NWSL has significantly improved from "the leanest years" when it launched with her as a player in 2013, and from the league's recent overhaul following what multiple investigations revealed as "systemic" abuse. Players have obtained more agency and workplace protection through the new CBA. One specific new policy Morgan pointed to is the ability to take paid mental health leave, as multiple players in the NWSL have done this year. "That just didn't exist a couple of years ago," Morgan said. And then I wasn't invited back for six or seven months. Everyone needs a break at some point or another, whether it's in their second year or 15th year playing soccer, playing sports, in their job. "There is no league without players, so let's treat them right, let's give them all the resources we could possibly do like with financial literacy, with mental stability, with family planning, whatever it may be. "She's not just lending her name -- she's in the meetings, driving ideas forward, and shaping the vision," Walton said. It's a campaign increasingly plastered across apparel, but it's also statistically backed (even if slightly exaggerated) by rising media deals, attendance, and valuations across women's sports. NWSL teams have increased from $2 million sales five years ago to a $250 million sale of Angel City FC last year. Morgan teased another forthcoming investment in women's sports "soon" when she spoke with ESPN. Morgan is learning day to day on the fly, but she knows one thing firsthand: "Listen, anyone who's smart is getting into investing in women's sports."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FILE - Members of the Afghan women's football team attend Morocco's practice ahead of the Women's World Cup in Melbourne, Australia, Wednesday, July 19, 2023. ZURICH (AP) — The Afghanistan national women's soccer team of refugee players has its first official games next month at a four-team tournament in Dubai, FIFA said Wednesday. The FIFA-supported team — which cannot yet officially represent Afghanistan in World Cup qualifying — will face the host United Arab Emirates, Chad and Libya in the Oct. 23-29 event. Afghanistan has not played an official women's competitive game since 2018, and the return to power of the Taliban regime in 2021 shut down women's sport. The Afghan soccer federation has obligations under FIFA statutes to avoid discrimination though has not been suspended from international soccer. The tournament “reinforces FIFA's efforts to promote and protect the right of all women and girls to play the sport, pursue their footballing dreams and thrive through the game,” the soccer body said. The women's teams of Chad and Libya do not yet have a FIFA ranking, and the UAE is No. FIFA said all games at the round-robin tournament will be broadcast live on its in-house streaming platform.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Black Women's Player Collective (BWPC) will cohost a showcase in November aimed at identifying and nurturing young Black soccer talent, the organization announced Wednesday. In partnership with Allstate and Black Star media, the Next Wave National Showcase will take place on the campus of Prairie View A&M, an historically Black college in Texas, from Nov. 22-25. According to BWPC data, 3.8 per cent of NWSL players self-identified as Black during the 2020 season. That figure has since grown to 12 per cent for the 2025 season, while Black players make up nearly half of the U.S. women's national team. “Black players have been historically underrepresented in this sport, and if you don't carve out space for us to exist in this community, then they'll be left behind,” North Carolina Courage forward Brianna Pinto, who serves on the board of the BWPC, told The Athletic before the announcement. One will be for players aged 13-17; the other for those 18-23, with an aim “to support NWSL clubs in early talent evaluation and provide players with exposure to a professional environment,” according to NWSL Director of Youth Development Karla Thompson. “In this country, in a lot of social environments, Black people have been an afterthought and we want to celebrate our collective experience as minorities in this country because we have so much to share and so much to give and so much passion for the game,” she said. “I do believe that if we pour into our community, it will benefit the entire soccer landscape.” The itinerary will include “a lot of playing so that they can properly be evaluated,” Pinto said, adding the event would aim to “identify talent and push them to where they need to be.” There will also be networking opportunities with coaches, scouts, and agents; and a media day for the players to gain experience interacting with the press. Pinto said one detail that's garnered excitement among the BWPC is the inclusion of hair, makeup, and “off the field glam,” as she put it, to expose players to that side of professional sports. In 2021, U.S. women's national team star Crystal Dunn spoke about the disappointment of walking into similar environments and being unable to work with hair and makeup artists who were trained to work with Black textured hair and darker complexions. She also hopes that it will “shift the landscape and give more attention to HBCU athletics programs.” “Joy is a contagious thing because if we put on an event where people are celebrated and they feel valued and seen as a whole human being, I think that's a way of protesting, of making space for these incredible individuals who are going to make up the next generation of athletes.” (Top photo of Brianna Pinto: Jared Tilton/NWSL via Getty Images) She also hosts the weekly “Full Time” women's soccer podcast. As a freelance journalist, she covered the 2023 World Cup in Australia and the CONCACAF W Gold Cup for The Athletic, as well as women's soccer stories for ESPN Andscape, USA Today's Pro Soccer Wire, and other publications.</p>
