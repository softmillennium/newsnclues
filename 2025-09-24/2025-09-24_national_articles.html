                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth speaks during the POW/MIA National Recognition Day Ceremony at the Pentagon, Friday, Sept. 19, 2025, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon has stepped back from the policy that requires all troops to get the flu shot every year by introducing exemptions for reservists and proclaiming that the shot is only necessary in some circumstances for all service members, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press. The memo, written by Deputy Defense Secretary Steve Feinberg on May 29 and sent to all the military services, says reserve troops now will need to be on active duty for 30 days or more before being required to get an annual flu shot. It also says the military will no longer be paying for reservists or National Guard members to get the vaccine on their own time. News of the policy change, which has not been publicly announced by the Pentagon, comes as the Trump administration and its advisers have suggested changes to other vaccination guidance. An influential immunization panel that the administration updated to include anti-vaccine figures decided to not recommend the COVID-19 shot to anyone, while President Donald Trump used his platform to promote unproven and, in some cases, discredited ties between the pain reliever Tylenol, vaccines and autism. At the Pentagon, the flu shot memo declared that “going forward, the Department will conserve its resources by requiring seasonal flu vaccination for Service members only when doing so most directly contributes to readiness.” However, the document is not clear about the changes because it later says the annual requirement for active-duty troops is still in effect. While the memo was quietly sent months ago, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth drew attention to it Wednesday when he reposted a comment from an anonymous account that claimed they “won't be forced to get a flu shot this fall for the privilege of serving my state and country in the National Guard.” Those who declined the vaccination have been able to return to service since 2023, but only 113 of the more than 8,000 discharged service members had chosen to do so. The back pay offer was intended to encourage more to reenlist but met with limited success. Two months later, Pentagon officials said only 13 people — all Army soldiers — had rejoined the military.</p>

FIRST ON FOX — Eight federal inmates — once on death row for murders, including the killings of fellow prisoners, gang-related stabbings, and the slayings of two campers — have been transferred to a notorious "supermax" prison in Colorado, the Justice Department told Fox News Digital. The news comes as U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi looks to crack down on the previous administration's sweeping clemency actions. The eight former death row inmates were transferred Tuesday to the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence, Colorado, also known as "ADX," Justice Department officials confirmed. They were among the 37 death row inmates whose sentences Biden commuted in late December — prompting criticism and complaints that the record clemency and commutation actions were done as a political "Hail Mary," and without proper vetting.

(Joe Raedle/Getty) The effort comes as Bondi and the Trump administration have sought to reverse some of the Biden administration's efforts on criminal justice reform for certain criminals, and instead moved to prioritize violent crime and cracking down on the nation's worst offenders. Though a commutation cannot be fully reversed, Justice Department officials told Fox News Digital, Bondi has prioritized ways to penalize these individuals, in coordination with directives from Trump, and to ensure that the "conditions of confinement" are "consistent with the security risks those inmates present because of their egregious crimes, criminal histories, and all other relevant considerations," according to an earlier DOJ memo. The eight inmates sent to ADX this week were each convicted of first-degree murder within federal jurisdiction. Many had been convicted of crimes that were especially heinous or violent. One individual was convicted of murdering a married couple who was camping at a campsite in the Ouachita National Forest in July 2003. A photo of the ADX Supermax Prison in Florence, Colorado. Among them are Ramzi Yousef, convicted in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the Boston Marathon bombers; former Sinola Cartel leader Joaquín Guzmán, or "El Chapo"; and Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, the co-founder of al-Qaeda. "President Biden's decision to commute the death sentences of these monsters showed abhorrent disregard for our justice system and total disrespect for victims' families already suffering through immense loss," Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "After meeting with many of the victims' families at the Department of Justice and promising to take action on their behalf, eight of these prisoners have been transferred to the Colorado super-max prison ADX. This will ensure that they spend the remainder of their lives in conditions consistent with the egregious crimes they committed," she added. Shortly after her confirmation as attorney general, Bondi issued a memo aimed at "restoring a measure of justice" to the victims' families. The measures granted by Biden earned more criticism than former President Barack Obama: As Fox News reported at the time, the vast majority of Obama's clemency actions focused on commuting the sentences of federal inmates who met certain criteria outlined under his administration's Clemency Initiative. Bondi hosted victims' families earlier this year to hear their concerns about the commutations, DOJ said. Some said they had been stunned by the eleventh-hour commutations, and that they not been given a heads-up by the Biden administration. In February, Bondi issued a memo to the Bureau of Prisons ordering an evaluation of where these prisoners should be detained.

Turning Point USA spokesman Andrew Kolvet discussed jurisdictional security issues following the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk on Sept. 10. Two weeks after Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk was assassinated, spokesman Andrew Kolvet revealed who had jurisdiction to monitor the rooftop where the alleged killer fired the fatal shot. Many questioned why Robinson was not spotted by Kirk's security team, who were feet away from him when he was assassinated. Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, was speaking at his "American Comeback Tour" when he was shot in the neck and killed. On an episode of "The Charlie Kirk Show" Wednesday afternoon, Kolvet said the Turning Point USA security team does not have the authority to police rooftops or surrounding areas during campus speaking events. "In defense of our security team, people need to understand that they do not have jurisdiction on the rooftops or the surrounding area," Kolvet said. "Their only jurisdiction on a campus is Charlie's physical proximity, and they were coordinating with local PD and campus PD to make sure all of those venues [were secure]." Blake Neff, producer of "The Charlie Kirk Show," added Turning Point USA did not have counter snipers or Secret Service to monitor the area outside of Kirk's immediate vicinity.

Sheriff's Office) "Many campus PDs do not have drone programs, which is a big problem," Kolvet said. "I'm actually working on that because it's something they should all have. It should be mandated by some sort of law. … So anyway, just in quick defense of the security, they're only allowed to protect his immediate vicinity. Drones have become an increasingly popular resource for police to monitor crowd movements, traffic flow, and potential security threats. They are cheaper and quicker to deploy than helicopters, and can transmit live video to command centers in real time. Police officers and FBI agents walk through the courtyard at Utah Valley University where Charlie Kirk was assassinated Sept. 10, 2025. However, law enforcement still must follow Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations, and may need special waivers to fly over large groups of people, or at specific locations. While Kirk supposedly did not raise any specific security concerns about the Sept. 10 speaking engagement at Utah Valley University, guest speaker Dr. James Orr said in the episode that Kirk acknowledged the "risk" of an upcoming trip to the University of Missouri on Sept. 29. "We were putting plans in place for me to go with him to the University of Missouri," Orr said. "[Kirk] said, 'You know, that's going to be the tough one.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Residents of a San Francisco Bay Area city are on the lookout for an aggressive squirrel that has sent at least two people to the emergency room for medical treatment. Joan Heblack told ABC affiliate KGO-TV that she was walking in the Lucas Valley neighborhood of San Rafael when a squirrel seemingly came out of nowhere and attacked her leg, clawing and biting. The tail was flying up here. Isabel Campoy also said she was attacked while walking in the same area. The squirrel launched itself from the ground to her face and wound up on her arm, leaving it bloody, she said. Both women went to the emergency room, the TV station reported in its Monday story. Flyers have now been posted, warning residents that the squirrel is no joke and that more than five people have been attacked by a ”very mean squirrel” that “comes out of nowhere.” Lisa Bloch with Marin Humane says they have had no reports of squirrel attacks since mid-September. “We've seen this kind of behavior before,” she said. “It's almost always because someone has been feeding the animal.” The good thing is that squirrels are not vectors for rabies. She says people should never feed wildlife.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Budowich, President Donald Trump's deputy chief of staff overseeing communications, will leave the administration later this month for a new job, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. His imminent exit makes him the highest-profile staffer to leave the White House in Trump's second term, which is now at its eight-month mark. It's not uncommon for White House staffers to cycle out after about a year. The relative stability of this administration's staff is a departure from Trump's first term, which was characterized by frequent turnover. Budowich, who declined to comment on Wednesday, served as Trump's spokesperson after he left office in 2021 and later ran the Trump-aligned super PAC MAGA Inc., before rejoining the 2024 campaign. Axios first reported his departure. Up until now, the highest-profile aide to depart had been Mike Waltz. But while he was ousted as national security adviser in May, he's since been confirmed as Trump's ambassador to the United Nations. A Warner Bros. CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.</p>

Families announced legal action against American Airlines and the U.S. government over the Jan. 29 American Eagle Flight 5342 crash near Washington, D.C. (Credit: Pool) The Jan. 29 crash involved an Army Black Hawk helicopter that collided midair with an American Airlines passenger plane near Ronald Reagan Washington International Airport, killing 64 people on the American Eagle flight and three aboard the military helicopter. The federal lawsuit was filed on behalf of Casey Crafton's estate, with his wife Rachel and family leading the legal action. "Casey was betrayed by systemic disregard for safety. We cannot stand by and allow his life to be lost in vain." Multiple victims' family members spoke at a news conference Wednesday, accusing the US government and American Airlines of negligence. American Airlines allegedly ignored repeated near misses and congestion data, prioritizing profit over safety, according to attorneys. "… American ran red lights for years by allowing these planes to operate in congested, unsafe conditions." The plane collided with a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter on January 29, killing 67 people. Attorneys said the FAA failed to provide safe air traffic control and allowed unsafe operational environments, while the Army helicopter crew failed to follow basic "see and avoid" flight principles. "The helicopter crew's conduct was inexcusable," said Brian Alexander, an attorney and former Army aviator. "Air traffic control completely failed in their duty as the lifeguards of our aviation system." Wreckage is seen in the Potomac River near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, on Thursday, Jan. 30. (Petty Officer 1st Class Brandon Giles, U.S. Coast Guard via AP) Before suing the government, families must first file separate Form 95 claims, which attorneys said have already been filed by nearly all the victims' families. The Crafton case is expected to serve as a guiding complaint for other victims' families, which are expected to be consolidated in federal court. Doug Lane, who lost his wife, Christine, and son, Spencer, in the crash, said more than 120 family members have banded together to "become something both beautiful and powerful." "We support each other through birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, weddings—that were planned but never held," Lane said. He said the group has also "turned our grief into action." "We've collaborated with Congress on critical air safety reforms. We've secured a much-needed set of oversight investigations into the FAA, and we will not rest until similar investigations are underway into the US Army," Lane said. "We'll bring that same level of passion and relentlessness as we seek accountability and change through the legal process. … We are here to see this process through, however long it takes, to ensure that our family members have a lasting legacy that makes the world safer for everyone who flies." The lawsuit is seeking both monetary damages and congressional air safety reforms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• The victims: One detainee is dead and two more are in critical condition following a shooting at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Dallas, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Aerial video captured by CNN affiliate KTVT shows officers searching a building where authorities say a gunman fired at the nearby ICE facility in Dallas and shot three ICE detainees. Of the three ICE detainees shot, two were killed, and a third was hospitalized, authorities have said. Vice President JD Vance responded sharply to the deadly shooting at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas on Wednesday, calling it an act of politically motivated violence and directly blaming what he described as inflammatory rhetoric from Democratic leaders and the media. “We're still learning a little bit about it,” Vance said during remarks in Concord, North Carolina, “but what we know is that in Dallas, Texas, an ICE facility was opened fire upon by a violent left-wing extremist a person who wrote anti-ICE messaging on their bullets.” “When the left-wing media lies about what [ICE is] doing,” he said, “what they're doing is encouraging crazy people to go and commit violence.” “You don't have to agree with Donald Trump's immigration policies. But if your political rhetoric encourages violence against our law enforcement, you can go straight to hell.” Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons described today's shooting as “a tragic incident” that “unfolded so quickly.” Lyons told Fox News this afternoon that the shooter fired into an open waiting area known as the sallyport, where agents brought in detainees. He said the ICE facility was “a definite target,” adding that windows, doors and vehicles were also fired at. He was there to attack that building,” Lyons told Fox. He said everyone is “shook up” by the incident and called for an end to violence against ICE. “What we got to do first and foremost is protect the men and women of ICE, harden up our facilities, make sure we're safe,” he said. “Then we really got to target these people that are anti-ICE rhetoric or causing threats and really take a deep dive and see what happened with this gentleman right here.” Jahn, 29, had lived in a Dallas suburb, according to public records. He pleaded guilty and the case again him was deferred, with Jahn being placed on probation, according to Collin County court records. Jahn voted in the Democratic primary in March 2020 and hasn't voted since then, according to records provided to CNN by the Collin County Elections Department. Voters in Texas don't declare a political party when registering to vote, but choose a party's ballot when voting in primaries. Dallas Mayor Eric L. Johnson called for healing and unity after a shooting at an ICE facility left two people dead Wednesday. “We are better than this craven act of violence,” the mayor said in a statement. “In moments like this, our city must stand together and support one another. He said violence like Wednesday's shooting should never happen and that it affected an entire community, not just law enforcement and the victims. A gunman targeted an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Dallas, Texas, this morning, leaving one detainee dead and two others hospitalized in critical condition. Authorities have said the gunman killed himself after opening fire. Here's more on what we know, so far, about today's shooting: Jahn lived in a Dallas suburb, according to public records. Jahn voted in the Democratic primary in March 2020 and hasn't voted since, according to records provided to CNN by the Collin County Elections Department. The shooting: Dallas police received an “assist the officer call” at around 6:40 a.m. local time, Chief Daniel Comeaux said during a news conference today. DHS said in a statement, “This was an attack on ICE law enforcement.” CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, Leigh Waldman, Chris Boyette, Alisha Ebrahimji, Casey Tolan, Curt Devine and Maureen Chowdhury contributed to this report. The shooter believed to be responsible for killing two detainees and injuring a third at a Dallas ICE facility is Joshua Jahn, according to three sources familiar with the case. Jahn is 29 years old, one source briefed on the investigation told CNN. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons confirmed the suspect's identity in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday afternoon, saying of Joshua Jahn, “he was known to law enforcement.” But they want to drill down and figure out what made him anti-ICE, what made him want to do that, and see if there's any co-conspirators, see if the facility is still safe, see if anything else is still planned.” The three detainees shot at the ICE facility in Dallas Wednesday – two of whom were killed – had been arrested and were to be transferred to a longer-term facility, ICE deputy director Madison Sheahan told Fox News. The three detainees were in the country illegally and “being processed at this facility and would have been moved to a long-term detention facility,” Sheahan told Fox News. Two detainees were killed, and one is in serious condition after the shooting, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN. Until that time, I don't want to jump ahead on any families dealing with this tragedy,” she said. “What we do know so far is that the shooter was firing indiscriminately throughout the whole building,” Sheahan told Fox News on Wednesday. The deputy director added that it was a potentially “very dangerous situation” for law enforcement. No law enforcement personnel were injured, according to Joe Rothrock, special agent in charge of the FBI's Dallas field office. Greg Abbott said the shooting at the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Dallas today will not deter officials from carrying out immigration actions. “We will not let this cowardly attack impede our efforts to secure the border, enforce immigration law, and ensure law and order,” Abbott said in a statement. He said agencies like ICE, in coordination with the state's Department of Public Safety and the National Guard, will continue to “arrest, detain, and deport any individuals in this country illegally — without interruption.” Bullet casings with “anti-ICE messages” were found on scene where a “sniper” opened fire and shot three detainees, according to DHS. Two are deceased, and the other is in critical condition. The DHS statement also noted that “shell casings were found with anti-ICE messages on them. FBI Director Kash Patel posted about the casings on X earlier. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is blaming “far-left” rhetoric about US Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the deadly shooting at a field office in Dallas this morning. “For months, we've been warning politicians and the media to tone down their rhetoric about ICE law enforcement before someone was killed,” Noem said in a post on X. “These horrendous killings must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences.” So far, officials have given little information about a possible motive. Two detainees were killed and one is in serious condition after the shooting, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN. During an earlier news conference, officials said no law enforcement agents were injured or shot. Two detainees were killed, and one is in serious condition after a shooting at a Dallas ICE facility Wednesday morning, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN. During an earlier press conference, authorities didn't provide details on the fatalities but noted that no law enforcement agents were injured or shot. In a post on X, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem condemned heightened rhetoric against ICE, saying: “These horrendous killings must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences.” Ruth Harper, an immigration attorney based in Dallas, Texas, reported to the Dallas ICE facility on Wednesday morning for a routine check in for her client, she told CNN Wednesday. When she arrived, police had blocked off access to the facility and told her there was an active shooter. One of her clients is at the facility; another, who was expected to report for the check in today, was not on site. Dallas police said one person is dead and two people are hospitalized with injuries after a shooting this morning at the ICE field office in Dallas. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem earlier said the suspect died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Multiple law enforcement officials told CNN the person killed was a detainee. “Today, at approximately 6:40 a.m. (local time), we received a(n) assist the officer call. Politically motivated violence is wrong,” Cruz said during a news conference in Dallas following the ICE facility shooting. Cruz said that this morning's incident is “the third shooting in Texas directed at ICE or CBP. Cruz went on to say that he hopes that “every one of us will pray, number one for the law enforcement that are risking their lives to keep us safe; number two, for the health of those who were shot and injured today. He added that a debate about immigration policies can happen in the halls of Congress “without demonizing each other.” “I can confirm at this time that the FBI is investigating this incident as an act of targeted violence,” said Special Agent in Charge Joe Rothrock. None of the people shot in this morning's shooting at a Dallas ICE facility were members of law enforcement, FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Joe Rothrock said, though officials are not yet confirming the identities of the victims. “This will be an ongoing investigation between us, a number of federal partners and our local partners, again, to ensure that anyone responsible is held accountable,” Rothrock said. Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson asked people to “be patient” and “remain calm” as law enforcement conduct the investigation into Wednesday morning's shooting at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A drone fired from Yemen has struck the southern Israeli city of Eilat. Medics said at least 20 people were wounded, two of them seriously. It wasn't immediately clear if they were hurt by the drone or an interceptor. JERUSALEM (AP) — A drone launched by Yemen's Houthi rebels wounded 22 people in the southern Israeli city of Eilat on Wednesday, according to medics. It was a rare breach of Israel's sophisticated missile defenses, which have greatly limited casualties from such attacks. In the Gaza Strip, at least 41 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire, according to local hospitals. U.S. President Donald Trump's Mideast envoy expressed optimism over a new plan for ending the war, without saying what it entails or if Israel or Hamas have accepted it. Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have regularly fired drones and missiles at Israel — and attacked international shipping — in what they say is support for the Palestinians. The vast majority of the drones and missiles fired at Israel have been shot down or fallen in open areas without wounding anyone. The Houthis said in a statement that they had fired two drones at Israel. The Magen David Adom rescue service said the wounded were taken to a nearby hospital, two of them with “severe shrapnel injuries to their limbs.” In Gaza, at least 22 people were killed when an Israeli strike hit tents sheltering displaced people in Gaza City, according to Dr. Fadel Naim, director of the Al-Ahli hospital, which received the casualties. Three children and nine women were among those killed, he told The Associated Press. The Israeli military said it targeted two Hamas militants, using precise munitions and taking other measures to avoid harming civilians. Israel blames Hamas for civilian deaths because the militants are embedded in densely populated areas. Another Israeli strike hit a group of Palestinians in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing at least 12 of them, according to the Al-Awda Hospital. There was no immediate comment from the military on those strikes. Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza said that it received the bodies of three people killed by gunfire while seeking aid. Health officials in Gaza and the U.N. human rights office say hundreds of people have been killed by Israeli fire while seeking humanitarian aid in recent months. The military said soldiers shot and killed a man after he hurled an explosive device at them. At separate events, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's lead negotiator Steve Witkoff both offered optimistic views about what Witkoff called a “Trump 21-point plan for peace” that was presented to Arab leaders on Tuesday. And we're hopeful, and I might say even confident, that in the coming days, we'll be able to announce some sort of breakthrough.” Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, in a post on X, said the latest proposals are “an important foundation upon which we can build further in the coming period to achieve peace.” Those efforts suffered a major setback earlier this month when Israel carried out an airstrike targeting Hamas leaders in Qatar. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. Forty-eight captives are still inside Gaza, around 20 of them believed by Israel to be alive, after most of the rest were freed in ceasefires or other deals. Israel's ongoing retaliatory offensive has killed more than 65,000 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It doesn't say how many were civilians or combatants, but says women and children make up around half the fatalities. U.N. agencies and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties. Israel launched another major ground operation earlier this month in Gaza City, which experts say is experiencing famine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? It is impossible, I think, to grasp the terrible consequences of Charlie Kirk's death without understanding who he was in life. Liberals had a dim view of that track record — focusing on his often-offensive radio broadcasts and contributions to Trump's authoritarian project (like sending seven buses to the January 6 protest). However, to conservatives, he was something very different: not just an effective political organizer but a living symbol of democratic politics done the right way. I must admit that this second perspective doesn't come naturally to me. But I wanted to understand it better, so I reached out to Tanner Greer — a conservative author and essayist who had written brilliantly about what Kirk meant to the right on his blog The Scholar's Stage. In his piece, Greer argues that Kirk was “the indispensable man” on the populist right: Nobody else had his genius for organization or his extensive connections with nearly everyone of note in the MAGA movement. On an ideological level, per Greer, Kirk represented a vision of politics in which the populist right competes on the left's turf, from universities to elections, and wins in direct political combat. In this, he stood against MAGA's most radical anti-democratic voices. So when he was killed, Greer explains, his many friends and allies saw it as proof that the broader left was now incapable of coexisting with even someone as genial and small-d democratic as Kirk — giving rise to the vehement, even authoritarian, response of people like Stephen Miller and JD Vance. I didn't agree with much of the thinking Greer described. But I found his explanation of it, to borrow a phrase, “indispensable.” He helped me understand why leading Republicans blame an ill-defined “they” for Kirk's killing, rather than a shooter who seemingly acted alone, and just how emotional these conservatives must be in the wake of Kirk's passing. If we are to keep sharing a country, you need to understand this perspective — perhaps especially if you disagree with it. What follows is a transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. Tell me what you think most people who only knew Kirk from his radio broadcasts missed about him. You wouldn't get any of this at all if all you knew of him was some guy who's willing to say shocking things on the internet. In the piece, I suggest there's [several] aspects of Charlie Kirk that made him a very powerful individual. His radio show had about 500,000 people who listened to it. If he wanted to come out and publicly take a position, Republicans would listen. This is a mass talent-building machine, as future political leaders often come from people who were TPUSA chapter leaders in their universities. And then on top of that, he builds these other outreach organizations. He has a giant outreach organization for evangelical church leaders. Then he has a vote-getting machine that is very active in swing states in the 2024 election — most Republicans seem to think that TPUSA's Turning Point Action Committee might've gotten 10 to 20,000 votes in Arizona, which is basically the margin of a [close] election. They had perfected the strategy of basically primarying people for not being MAGA enough in Arizona, which is TPSUA's organizational home, and they were going to go state to state to state in the near future. Your third source of power is that he's this connector. Because he himself had kind of raised up this whole generation of new activists, he knew who was the best potential staffers or the best potential state House candidates or congressional candidates. He was constantly working to get people from one part or one of these constituencies to meet them with somebody else. You wrote, “There are a good four dozen people in the Trump administration who owe their appointments to an introduction Kirk made on their behalf. The number might be underestimated — because Kirk was involved in a very personal way in vetting for this administration's appointments. You have to understand the right has a problem: We have a much smaller talent pool than the left. And if you are restricting it even further, if you need to restrict your talent pool to people who are more MAGA — people [who] can pass a Laura Loomer test — then you have an even smaller number of potential people. And so Kirk basically spends all the months of November and December and January, every day, meeting with [then-White House personnel director] Sergio Gor, talking about, “Here's somebody who might be good for this position, here's somebody who shouldn't be in that position.” And he wasn't the only one doing that, but he was a big part of getting people in the door and keeping some people out. But this isn't just true for little [roles]. JD Vance is there because of Charlie Kirk. During 2024, Charlie Kirk took a three-month break from TPUSA to basically be Don Jr.‘s manager. And Kirk sends a text to Don and says [something like], “I know that this guy [Vance] said these things about how Trump was Hitler back in the time, but he's had a conversion. If you listen to the Charlie Kirk radio show that JD Vance hosted, he mentions this story. And almost every single person they had from the administration come on has a very similar story. There's half a dozen Cabinet-level or people just below that who can say, “Kirk advocated for me to have this position, and that helped tip the balance.” You can hear that not just in what they said, but the way in which they said it, in the obvious pathos and emotionality that came across in the discussions of Kirk during that radio broadcast or during the funeral on Sunday night. Part of me thinks, “Well, everybody on the right wants to have been close to him now.” But listening to you talk and listening to some of the stories people tell, I think this is just actually true: that he really did mean a lot to a lot of the people that are in power right now. And so part of this vehement political reaction to Kirk's death is born out of this deep emotional and personal connection with him. That's why all these donors are able to give him so much money. He was very good at being very optimistic and being like, “We're going to win, we can do this,” cheering people up. It's “they” killed Charlie, “they” took Charlie from us, even though there's no evidence that the shooter was in any kind of conspiracy. So what do people on the right mean by “they?” When George Floyd died in 2020, there was not a sense that this was the action of a single policeman, and if we put him in jail, then the problem's over. There was rather a sense that you could only have a person like this policeman, who's willing to stand on the neck of a Black man he's just arrested until he dies — this could only happen if you have a larger systemic problem in America. I think many, many people on the right want to have their own version of the 2020 moment, partially because their analysis is very structurally similar to how leftists thought about racism in 2020. They think there's larger structural problems — that [the shooter] only can exist because of a larger culture that supports his conduct, excuses it, and allows it to happen. All these people went through 2020 and they want to have a similar reckoning, because that was experienced by the right as a very harrowing event — where essentially every single institution in the United States, every university, every provost, most corporations all gave out statements talking about how what happened was an act of evil and we need to nationally atone for the sin. And I think this is the easiest way to make sense of why some people on the right feel very strongly that we need to do things like, say, take Jimmy Kimmel off the air. They remember 2020, and they feel like if Jimmy Kimmel had gone against Black Lives Matter, he would've been taken off the air without the state. And so we should try to create the same sort of structural cultural change that was imposed upon us in the Great Awokening. Help me understand that comparison a little bit more. In the George Floyd scenario, it's pretty easy to see what the structural roots of Derek Chauvin's actions are — a policing sector, and a society more broadly, shot through with racism. Who specifically are “they” that embody whatever the structure is? [At the broadest], it's all the way to a [liberal] culture that sees Trump as inherently illegitimate and un-American and [as someone who] should be deplatformed. Just to give you an example: Somebody was making a big deal out of a tweet that Vice President Harris had written in 2019, saying how basically, if we're being honest with ourselves, Trump should be kicked off Twitter by now because of his bad comments. I'm not trying to weigh in with my own opinions on this. I just want to understand better what is this “they”? JD Vance, for example, has brought up the Open Society Foundation, which in no plausible world had anything to do with Charlie Kirk's death. Many actors on the right have for many years believed — and I have a lot of sympathies with this set of beliefs — that a lot of what the left has been about for the last decade, since the Great Awokening started, is basically making it difficult for conservatives to be part of the public sphere in a safe and confident way. And that word “safe” is interesting because when you start talking about safety, you can start roping in several different streams, which I don't think liberals would necessarily associate with each other, into one system. This allows you to say, okay, people being deplatformed on campuses, that's one version of us not being able to participate publicly. All the way to the riots in 2020, which a lot of conservatives felt Democratic cities and the sitting government allowed — which made it impossible for a person like me to be in these urban spaces for X amount of time. They made these cities too dangerous for us to be in. And that's where people will do this kind of mining, where, okay, Soros funded this Black Lives Matter-adjacent organization, which was making excuses for rioters here. Someone like you, you'll look at that and say, “Well, what does that have to do with Charlie Kirk being assassinated by this [lone wolf]?” And I think a lot of people on the right will say, “No, no, no, this is a large systemic thing. I think that's how they would connect those dots. Now, how does that attitude relate to something you talk about in the article at length, which is Kirk's role in giving young conservatives permission to be themselves publicly in places like a university? This question of what he meant to the young conservatives is quite relevant to this larger question: What is the “they”? The way I explain it in this piece — this is really hard for liberals to believe — is that, if you were a young conservative on campus from 2013 to 2022, you felt afraid. Even when Trump was in power, a lot of these conservatives felt afraid. And this fear is really core to a lot of what has happened, I mean, really in this administration as well as people's reactions to Kirk's death. This is the environment in which TPUSA begins its giant rise. And Kirk's campus tours, the sort of thing he was doing when he was shot, this is actually what they're designed to combat. Yes, they created some viral clips, but that really was not their main purpose. The purpose of these was for Kirk to go into these universities and say, “Hey, guys, look, we can be part of the public sphere. And I can show you guys that these beliefs we have are defendable. And so there's a lot of young conservatives who basically say, “Charlie Kirk made me unafraid to be an activist. Charlie Kirk is the one who made me unafraid to stand up for what I believed.” Without someone like Charlie, the only people who would stand up for their conservative beliefs tended to be either extremely principled people or they were just assholes who like to be disagreeable. He's modeling to all these kids, look, you guys can do this too. And so when the guy whose whole message is “you don't have to be afraid” is shot, then it makes some sense why people might be feeling afraid. I have this fear, given Kirk's personal significance, that the right's authoritarian reaction to his death is not going to be a short-lived thing — you may disagree. But if Charlie Kirk was trying to create a politics where people who disagree could engage, the aftermath of his death is destroying that possibility. So what are we supposed to do about that? I think the right has to decide whether Kirk's life or his death is the thing that should be remembered. I think that Kirk's life, although many aspects of it are very repellent to people on the left, is an example of how this conservative national populist thing can be done without authoritarian measures and be very popular. I personally am on the side of saying, “Guys, look, Kirk actually showed us the path for how to make this work, and we'd be stupid if we left it for something that we don't know if it will work.” Because 2020 had very many special things that led up to it. But in addition to that, you had years of activism. And the New York Times had basically doubled its reporting on racism and racial problems in America in the three years that preceded 2020. You had a huge amount of intellectual work being done. You had a huge amount of activism being done. And I understand, too, that certain people have a bad opinion of Kirk. But I do think that the impulse of some on the left to take this moment to say, “Well, Charlie Kirk was just this terrible person in all these ways, he said this terrible and that terrible thing, and we're being censored if we don't see otherwise” — to put it very frankly, lots of people on the [more radical] right are very happy to see those takes. How much of a threat really are they to us?” And so when the reaction of some people is to condemn the violence, but then talk about how actually it's good that he's gone, which is more or less what these people do, it sounds more like you are part of this structure of ideas that makes it acceptable for right-wing people to be killed. I think clearly this is what [former Vox co-founder and now New York Times columnist] Ezra Klein was thinking when he wrote that editorial. But he got dragged through the mud for that, and he really had to justify himself showing up, talking to people on the right. Maybe it's helpful if folks on the left don't just discount Kirk as that terrible racist who says all these terrible things. If that's the message you took away from all this, I think you'll really misunderstand both what Kirk meant to the movement, but also what his death means to the movement as well. The right's new assault on free speech isn't cancel culture. ﻿Is the best way to fight Trump “normal” politics — or something else? A roundtable discussion among leading MAGA intellectuals suggests they might be suffering from success. Bronze Age Pervert is an influential voice on the extreme right. Now he's trying to change the administration's economic approach. Lawrence Dennis predicted America would fall to fascism in the 1930s. His errors have much to teach us today.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When President Donald Trump describes his plans to deploy the National Guard to Memphis as a “replica” of what he's done with federal troops in Washington, D.C., he's attempting to make two points: first, that it's appropriate for him to deploy the military in American cities at all, and second, that doing so effectively reduces crime in cities that just happen to be run and disproportionately populated by his perceived political foes. But the vision he has laid out to “make Memphis safe again” is familiar in another key way: It looks a lot like the crime-fighting strategy the city tried just a few years ago—one that ultimately failed. The president signed an executive memorandum on September 15 directing federal agents to combat street crime in Memphis through “hypervigilant policing,” “aggressive prosecutions,” and “strict enforcement of applicable quality-of-life, nuisance, and public-safety laws.” The memo called for “large-scale saturation of besieged neighborhoods” and highlighted issues such as graffiti, noise, public intoxication, and traffic violations as areas of focus for federal agents set to descend on the city. All of this sounds remarkably similar to what Memphis tried previously—an effort that, according to the Department of Justice, had disastrous results. “We have reasonable cause to believe that MPD and the City engage in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the Constitution and federal law,” DOJ investigators wrote in a December 2024 report on the Memphis Police Department's activities, sharply rebuking a policing style that managed to antagonize local residents while doing little to solve or prevent violent crime. Third, MPD unlawfully discriminates against Black people when enforcing the law.” In response to that report—which found that crime had worsened despite the city's constitutionally questionable crackdown—Memphis leaders said they had already intervened to stop the most egregious abuses. Louis and New Orleans have been floated as targets for future troop deployments—the president is finding little resistance from their governors. This removes a significant obstacle that had complicated his plans to send Guardsmen into Chicago and Baltimore. Although Trump's threats to send Guardsmen into states with a Democratic governor tend to spark unified opposition from state and local leaders, his recent pivot has exposed tensions between state and local officials over race, local control, gun laws, and tax dollars. JB Smiley Jr., a member of the Memphis City Council, told me he feared that Trump's federal surge would disproportionately target Black residents and undocumented immigrants for petty violations, while doing little to solve serious crimes and address gun violence. “If your goal is to send troops there hoping something goes wrong so that you can send in a more aggressive military occupation, then I think this is what you do,” he said. Although violence has decreased significantly this year—overall crime is at a 25-year low, police said this month—Memphis ended 2024 with the highest rate of violent crime in the nation, according to FBI data. In recent years, homicides have regularly topped 300 a year in the city of about 630,000—a murder rate that the White House recently noted was four times higher than that of Mexico City. When I asked officials in Memphis why the city's crime rate had remained so high, several pointed to a 2021 state law allowing for permitless open carry of firearms, saying that it has exacerbated gun violence. In November, Memphis residents voted heavily in favor of a referendum opposing permitless gun ownership, although the superseding state law has blocked the city ordinance from going into effect. More than 90 percent of recent murders in the city involved a firearm. Trump's memo on “Restoring Law and Order in Memphis,” however, does not mention gun violence. It could be weeks before troops are in Memphis, a Pentagon official speaking on the condition of anonymity told The Atlantic. In the meantime, the state troopers have focused on traffic stops, issuing hundreds of tickets in recent days, local officials told me. The push is reminiscent of a strategy Memphians have become accustomed to—and, in many cases, annoyed with—even as their city has become more violent. Over a five-year period ending in 2023, officers in Memphis issued three times as many tickets as did their counterparts in the more populous city of Nashville, making 800,000 traffic stops and issuing 300,000 tickets, according to the Department of Justice. During that same period, murders in the city increased from 186 to 348 annually. White House officials credit the highly visible efforts with bringing down rates of carjackings and other crimes, although criminal-justice experts have suggested that such decreases are likely to be short-lived. Trust between Memphis residents and law enforcement is already strained, said La Vigne, who led the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice during the Biden administration. Video footage of Nichols crying for his mother while being punched, kicked, and hit with a baton led to nationwide protests and ultimately forced MPD to disband a street-crime unit that had been known for escalatory practices. It found that Memphis officers would violently retaliate against people who mouthed off at them, punch and kick suspects who were already handcuffed, and engage in stop-and-frisk searches without probable cause. Black Memphians such as Nichols, the department found, were disproportionately targeted for abuse. In May, Trump's DOJ closed its investigation into MPD and retracted the report's findings. The five officers involved in Nichols's death, who are also Black, have each either pleaded guilty or been convicted of various federal and state charges related to the killing. A Tennessee jury acquitted three of the officers on additional charges, including second-degree murder, in May. Trump has regularly complained that departmental guidelines and constitutional restrictions force police officers to be less “tough” than the criminals they are pursuing. In recent days, he has repeatedly complained about police officers who stand still and accept a verbal onslaught from protesters yelling in their face. In a statement, the White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson pointed out Memphis's elevated crime rates and asserted that Trump's efforts would reduce them. “Following the President's highly successful operation to combat violent crime in DC, which objectively drove down crime rates across the board, numerous Tennessee officials have applauded the President's decision to address crime in Memphis next,” she wrote. Addressing crime will benefit all who live in and visit Memphis.” The Memphis Police Department and Lee's office did not respond to requests for comment. Trump's push to send what he has called “rough-looking” federal troops into cities such as Memphis raises complex questions of race and class, Russell Wigginton, the president of the Memphis-based National Civil Rights Museum, told me. Memphis's mayor, its police chief, and most of the city's officers are Black. Several Memphians I spoke with flagged the dynamic as troubling. City leaders have said they would welcome federal help to combat violent crime, particularly to address Memphis's low clearance rates for the most serious offenses. The clearance rates for nonfatal shootings have been even lower. Given the seriousness of the crime problem, Trump's memo highlighting “public intoxication” and “unpermitted disturbances and demonstrations” has led to a fair share of eye rolling among local officials, Tami Sawyer, the general-sessions court clerk for Shelby County, which includes Memphis, told me. “They're going to come arrest people for vagrancy and loitering and noise and graffiti, but they're not going to take the guns out of circulation,” said Sawyer, who oversees much of the operation for the misdemeanor court cases and the jail in downtown Memphis. The Trump administration has done little to coordinate with local officials. A spokesperson for Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy, who would be responsible for deciding whether to charge many of the people swept up in any crackdown, told me last week that he was still waiting to receive a briefing from the Trump administration. Memphis Mayor Paul Young said he learned of Trump's decision to deploy troops when the president made the announcement on Fox News. Several officials have pointed out that the Trump administration abruptly cut a $1.7 million grant for a local nonprofit focused on violence prevention, and will likely spend many times that amount on the troop deployment. Meanwhile, residents told me that they have little choice but to wait and see whether the presence of soldiers once again marching through their city will deter crime or only further inflame tensions. “Memphis has its problems just like any other city—but we're not just this dystopia of foolishness and violence and crime,” Justin Brooks, who handles student recruitment for Christian Brothers University in Memphis, told me. We fought enough about Is it going to happen?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America. Published daily by senior writers and experts, these in-depth pieces go beyond the headlines to give readers the full picture. You can find our full list of In Focus pieces here. What if I told you 10 years ago that a presidential nominee who received more votes than any other woman in history and nearly won the presidency was relegated to the dustbin of history less than one year later? Former Vice President Kamala Harris launched the book tour that nobody asked for on Tuesday. The title of her tome, 107 Days, chronicles what can be considered the worst presidential campaign of our lifetimes. Team Harris blew through $1.5 billion in cash, and then some, ending up in debt, and got zero return on investment by losing every swing state and the popular vote, while also surrendering control of the Senate. “This is the first book to begin in Chapter 11,” Fox News's Jimmy Failia joked this week on America's Newsroom. As she often has done throughout her political career, Harris uses the book to do the same thing Hillary Clinton did for her loss, “What Happened,” in 2016: blame almost everyone but herself. And she's doing this while also laughably claiming that if she just had more time to campaign, the result would have been different. Think back to late July and August 2024: Harris is installed as the Democratic nominee without one vote from the public after President Joe Biden is tossed aside by his own party following a horrific debate performance in late June. Not allow her to do even one sit-down interview, even in the most friendly confines of MSNBC, CNN, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, or The View. But her campaign likely knew what many of us already did: Outside of prepared remarks in a teleprompter, Harris is a human Chernobyl. She simply has no talent for thinking or speaking extemporaneously. And when she has tried to do so in the past, such as her first run for president in 2020, she dropped out before the first votes were cast in Iowa. It is ironic that Harris's team has chosen The View for her first broadcast network interview for the book tour. It was here in October 2024 that her campaign essentially ended: Sunny Hostin asked her a T-ball question about what she would do differently than Biden. “You know … there is not a thing that comes to mind,” she answered while looking skyward. Here was Democratic strategist James Carville‘s reaction: “The country wants something different. And she's asked, as is so often the case, in a friendly audience, on The View, ‘How would you be different than Biden?' You literally freeze and say, ‘Well, I can't think of anything'” But it's virtually impossible to see Harris running again. Most people who voted for Harris were voting against Trump. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) easily on top when polling Democratic voters as to their preferred nominee at 37.6%. Harris, despite being vice president for four years and getting more than 75 million votes less than one year ago, is a distant second at 20.5%. Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg (12.1%), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) (10.8%), and Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) (3.6%) round out the top five. Speaking of Walz, who did the Harris campaign no favors as her running mate, thanks to him lying about fighting in war zones and claiming he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square riots — he was in Nebraska — Harris says she was forced into choosing the goofy governor of Minnesota because America wasn't ready for a gay vice president in Pete Buttigieg. As for her relationship with Biden, Harris claimed that she couldn't ask him not to run again before accusing him of being reckless by staying in. It should have been more than a personal decision.” She knew what his cognitive state was and lied directly to the public about it. Here's what Harris said right after Biden's debate against Trump that ended his political career: “Joe Biden is extraordinarily strong.” She then said, with a straight face to Anderson Cooper on CNN that night, Biden had a “slow start” but a “strong finish,” an assessment that exactly zero other people came away with. “He got into a groove where it counted,” she later told MSNBC. “Our president showed that he will win the election.” Harris is doing herself no favors with this book, and this already feels more like a revenge tour. How is Walz feeling today after hearing that he wasn't her first choice as her running mate? How do the Bidens feel about her calling them self-serving? “My concern about him running for reelection was completely separate from his capacity to serve … which was consistent and never wavered.” So, she thinks Biden couldn't campaign for a few months, but could run the country for another four years? She likely got a hefty advance from Simon & Schuster. On that front, the book is a success. But given that she and her husband are already worth millions, this isn't about the money. And thanks to napalming every remaining bridge to those who were once her allies, it's safe to say this will be the last we see of Harris on any major political stage again.</p>

Joe Nucci, like many brand-new therapists, loved showing off his fancy new psychology vocabulary during grad school. Some self-help creators online could use a bit of that wisdom. As the stigma surrounding mental health has waned over the last 10 years, an influx of well-meaning influencers and consumers looking to understand more about themselves may have bought into flattened descriptions of popular terms — like boundaries or narcissism — or have internalized simplistic ideas about their emotions. “If people were taking that advice too literally or without the important missing nuance, it could lead to decisions that would actually hurt mental health and not help it.” In Psychobabble: Viral Mental Health Myths and the Truths to Set You Free, Nucci outlines over three dozen misconceptions that have rampantly circulated online. Over the last decade or so, Nucci has noticed discussions around diagnoses morph from “You have X disorder” and “You are so much more than a label” to “almost a personality feature,” he says. Those with ADHD, for example, may run late because they are distracted, he explains. But if you believe running late is an unchangeable facet of your personality, you may make the symptoms worse and close yourself off to improvement. “We need to be using more language,” he says, “not less.” Nucci takes issue with the term “people pleaser” because it isn't specific and could refer to any number of behaviors. “Are you going along with things and then elevating your sense of moral superiority?” he says. “Are you self-sacrificing for one reason or another?” Some people may just be more agreeable than others and take pleasure when deferring to loved ones. In his own life, Nucci has been working on standing his ground and trying not to assume others are mad at him — he's been open with friends and family about it. Like many pop psychology-related concepts, the widely accepted definition of “love bombing” has shifted. “There are so many reasons why people move fast in dating,” Nucci says: lust, infatuation, falling for an idea of a person, confused expectations. Just because someone has intense feelings early in a relationship doesn't necessarily mean they're attempting to manipulate their romantic partner. Other popular mental health-related terms have also followed a similar trajectory: think about the social media posts you've seen referring to people as “toxic” or “narcissists.” As for love bombing, just because someone has intense feelings early in a relationship doesn't necessarily mean they're attempting to manipulate their romantic partner. Nor does taking a pause to slow things down if you're considering whether to continue dating after the initial infatuation has worn off. Racism, sexism, discrimination, and any number of systemic issues have certainly impacted his patients, Nucci says, but it's important for mental health practitioners to remember their patients have agency, too. Sometimes, repeatedly reminding people of all the ways the world is unfair may prevent them from seeing a way forward. “If you're on the really extreme end of prioritizing systemic justice,” Nucci says, “there's going to be situations in which you could actually do something as an individual. At the same time, it is important to acknowledge external forces you can't control. Being wholly committed to the idea that you can change your circumstances if you just work hard enough might only lead to burnout, exhaustion, and frustration. “Is it adaptive of you to take a step back, to take a deep breath and look at your context, look at the system that you're in? Becoming an amateur expert in mental health concepts doesn't equate with healing, Nucci says. In which case, learning more or digging deeper emotionally might not help. Instead, therapists could turn their approach to other forms of treatment, like cognitive behavioral therapy, which focuses on shifting thought patterns, or behavioral therapy, where you work on changing your actions. Suffice to say, endlessly trying to learn about mental health concepts and terminology online can also become counterproductive outside of a therapeutic environment. Most people differ in how open and vulnerable they expect their romantic relationships to be. Some want their significant other to be extremely expressive and raw; others might not be comfortable divulging everything to their spouse. “The type of intimacy that you would give your therapist, the types of details, the types of stuff you would talk about, I would not necessarily recommend speaking to your partner that way,” Nucci says. Just because you'd confide in a friend about trauma from your past doesn't mean it's necessarily appropriate to disclose that to your kids. Vulnerability is important in close relationships, but it doesn't mean you have to be totally vulnerable with every person you meet. “Maybe only one person gets that vulnerability with you,” Nucci says. While therapists are certainly qualified to treat patients on their mental health journeys, they are not “wise sages” on all topics, Nucci says, especially love. Therapy can help you identify unhelpful patterns in relationships and give you skills to help fix them, but it won't replace the experience of actually dating. “You've got to learn to put yourself back out there, and that's all any of us can do,” Nucci says. New genetic testing offers us the chance to create superbabies. When men lack the skills to build intimacy, their relationships — and well-being — suffer. ﻿The paradox of moral perfectionism — and how to escape it.</p>

Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) is investigating a Virginia school following allegations that a school official “arranged and bankrolled abortions” without parental consent.

Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) directed the Virginia state police to look into the allegations last month.

“As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), I am committed to ensuring parents are empowered with timely access to information necessary to protect their children from the threat of serious harm,” Cassidy wrote. “If these reports are true, they represent a betrayal of Fairfax County parents and families and warrant comprehensive oversight by the HELP Committee to determine how this could have occurred and who must be held accountable.”

A school social worker allegedly helped a 17-year-old girl at Centreville High School to have an abortion, while another girl “fled” an abortion clinic in fear of having an abortion. Fairfax County Public Schools has been accused of hiding the allegations.

“As Chairman of the HELP Committee, I am determined to ensure that federal education funds arenot being misused in violation of the law and parents' rights to protect their children,” he wrote.

“Given the seriousness of the allegations and the potential that federal funds were used by school officials to pressure minor students into receiving covert abortions without parental consent, it is imperative for the Committee to determine whether any federal funds were misused and whether the Hyde Amendment or other relevant laws were violated,” he added.

A TIMELINE OF TRUMP AND EPSTEIN'S RELATIONSHIP, FROM FRIENDSHIP TO FALLOUT AND BEYOND

Cassidy is asking the FCPS superintendent several questions, including about the school system's reporting requirements and other issues involving abortions and student pregnancies.

He's asking for a response to his questions by Oct. 6.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Our great national censorship nightmare is over — but only for about three-quarters of the ABC stations in America. Jimmy Kimmel was back on the air Tuesday night after Disney, the parent company of ABC, reversed its decision last week to suspend his talk show over comments he made about MAGA supporters' response to the killing of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk. That initial pause came after increasing pressure from the Trump administration and two TV station groups — Nexstar and the conservative-leaning Sinclair — which said last week they would not air Kimmel's show. First, it was a victory for free speech: the return of a show that was taken off the airwaves in part because of oblique threats from the Trump-era Federal Communications Commission's leadership, and the rebuffing of what my colleague Zack Beauchamp has called a “climate of fear and censorship” in the wake of Kirk's death, championed by conservative activists. Second, it was also a new kind of (partial) victory for liberals and their resistance efforts in the second Trump term. Led by celebrities, podcasters, influencers, and the grassroots — as opposed to any institutions, corporations, billionaires, or political parties — it managed to get a major corporation to resist Trump and restore Kimmel, even though his show is only returning to about three-quarters of the ABC-affiliated TV stations in America. While a variety of voices pushed back against this attempt at corporate censorship, Nexstar and Sinclair continued to boycott Kimmel's show last night — airing local news segments instead of Jimmy Kimmel Live! They don't show signs of reversing course yet. And it's not clear what mechanism — if any — Kimmel supporters have to influence either corporation to change its policy for now. Tuesday night's monologue might end up being the moment Kimmel revived this new type of resistance — or it might get lost in another wave of Trump-induced news and scandal. It will surely be one of his best-rated shows. Kimmel didn't directly apologize — and instead made an impassioned case for further Trump resistance, called in surprise guest (and Trump archenemy) Robert De Niro, and joked about Trump's physical appearance and the likelihood of an Epstein Files drop “to distract us from this now. Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods because he can't take a joke,” he said, holding back tears throughout the address. No less potently, Kimmel didn't identify as a liberal or a Democrat when attacking Trump, but as an American. Kimmel, who joked that he barely paid attention in school, said he never expected to be in his current position — fighting a war of principle against a would-be American despot — but that he was taught by comedians such as Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, and Howard Stern that censoring comedians is “un-American.” This was not a progressive or a liberal's cry of rage; Kimmel attacked Trump from the absolute dead-center. Sinclair and Nexstar are continuing their boycott of his show, setting up a potential showdown with Disney and ABC in the coming days. Sinclair's position seems ideological — demanding Kimmel apologize to Kirk's family and make a “meaningful” contribution to Kirk's activist group Turning Point USA. Nexstar argues that Kimmel's speech was harmful — though the company has a deal merging with Tegna, another major station owner, pending before Trump's FCC. Combined, their stations reach nearly a quarter of the American viewing public — meaning millions of Americans (in cities like Washington, DC, Nashville, Salt Lake City, Seattle, and St Louis) who might want to watch Kimmel's show simply can't turn on their televisions and do so (I, for one, had to watch his monologue on a clandestine TikTok livestream from my phone). Kimmel noted much of this during his monologue — citing pressure on affiliates in cities to not air his show and the slippery slope it might create in the future: “Should the government be able to regulate which podcasts the cellphone companies and wifi providers are allowed to let you download to make sure they serve the public interest?” His studio audience responded with a resounding, “No!” Kimmel and the decision-makers at the Mickey Mouse company might be hoping the rest of the country will keep feeling this way — but who knows if this fracas will be remembered beyond being just one more Trump scandal. That's part of what makes this moment of individual-led backlash seem so noteworthy — and one reason why it's not clear that it can be replicated. Kimmel raised this specter Tuesday night too, noting Trump's apparent desire to go after late-night comics specifically will probably continue. “Somehow, [he was able to] squeeze Colbert out of CBS, then he turned his sights on me, and now he's openly rooting for NBC to fire Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers and the hundreds of Americans who work for their shows,” he said. Instead, it was primarily driven by “talent” — actors, comedians, podcasters, and other individuals with a built-in audience and a public platform. It came from the hundreds of Hollywood movie stars, comedians, and other celebrities who signed open letters: one from the ACLU with more than 400 A-list signers, including De Niro, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, and Lin-Manuel Miranda; and another of more than 600 comedians, including Rosie O'Donnell, Kathy Griffin, and Chelsea Handler. It was musicians like Sarah McLachlan, Jewel, and Olivia Rodrigo who backed out of promotional events and appearances for Disney-backed projects, and at least one TV writer who said they wouldn't work with Disney in protest. It was current and past Marvel stars posting critically about Disney and free speech to their followers (Marvel Studios is owned by Disney). It was “a blatant assault on freedom of speech,” Colbert, whose own show is being scrapped under dubious circumstances, warned in his monologue last week. … You can't go around firing somebody because you're fearful or trying to suck up to an authoritarian — a criminal — administration in the Oval Office,” Letterman warned at a festival appearance last week. Even some of the podcasters and new media stars that often sympathize with MAGA voiced concerns over the last week. “Manosphere” influencers like the comedians Andrew Schulz and Akaash Singh spent time on their show and on social media explaining why conservatives should be outraged. Meanwhile, media personalities at the sports and pop culture brand Barstool Sports debated each other on whether the suspension was, in fact, government censorship. And though it took him some time to record an episode and he didn't call out Trump by name, Joe Rogan, probably the most vocal “free speech” defender of the podcasting world, ultimately criticized the FCC, too, and warned those cheering Kimmel's silencing that the same powers could be used on them in the future on Tuesday. But combined, they helped to spur on a tidal wave of pressure and criticism on Disney, its leadership, and its bottom line. Many of these same celebrities helped to encourage grassroots cancellations and boycotts of Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions, as well as its theme parks — which seem to have actually caused some economic damage. Kimmel referenced almost all of this during his opening monologue last night: He thanked his fellow comedians; he joked about the mass subscription cancellations; he thanked those “people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” including Rogan, Sen. Ted Cruz, and other conservative media voices. And he set himself up to be, if only for one night, Hollywood's Resistance leader. Of course, Trump weighed in before Kimmel even started speaking with another threat: “I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative,” he posted on Truth Social. And while ABC and Disney's brass may feel they deserve some credit for Kimmel's reinstatement — Kimmel thanked them for bringing him back and supporting his show over the years, though “unfortunately, and I think unjustly, this puts them at risk” — the extent of their willingness to fight Trump and a weaponized FCC remain open questions. In Trump's manosphere, the center is not holding. Trump had a lot to say at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. A pediatrician on why we should trust the vaccine schedule — even when Trump officials don't.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new California law that bans federal immigration officers from wearing face masks in the state is unconstitutional and unenforceable, according to former law enforcement officials. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) signed five bills into law that aim at restraining the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement from arresting illegal immigrants across the West Coast state, a move that he said was meant to deter federal authorities from carrying out President Donald Trump's mass deportation operation. The trouble for Newsom, according to several former police officials who spoke with the Washington Examiner on Tuesday, is that although the state could enforce this mask ban against its own local police and sheriff's deputies, it cannot dictate how federal police present themselves. “When a federal officer is acting within their official capacity and doing what they believe is … within the scope of their employment, they cannot be prosecuted, even if it in fact violated a state law,” said Fahey, now partner with the Holtzman Vogel law firm in Washington. “It seems pretty clear from a constitutional perspective that any efforts by California to thwart federal law enforcement actions will fail under the federal constitution's Supremacy Clause,” said Johnson, who leads the National Association of Police Organizations. “No doubt the governor and his advisers are aware of this, but once again have chosen the cheap theatrics of another ill-advised state policy that will be quickly struck down.” “Instead of focusing on all the problems within California and failure after failure of their policies, the governor once again seeks to deflect attention by stoking anger against law-enforcement officers and agents,” Johnson said. Betsy Brantner Smith, who spent nearly three decades at a large police department in the Chicago suburbs, said the California law was likely “ceremonial” and explained that face masks serve a purpose. “We wear face coverings in certain situations to prevent us — the law enforcement officer — from being identified,” Smith said. For example, SWAT teams and tactical teams very often wear face coverings, again, to prevent them from being identified, not to be hiding from the public.” California police could run into their own legal trouble if they attempt to arrest ICE personnel when the ban takes effect on Jan. 1, 2026. “If a state officer tried to arrest like an ICE agent for wearing a mask while they're out doing their job, the state officer would actually be arguably guilty of obstructing justice, and an ICE agent would be able to arrest the state officer who's trying to arrest them,” Fahey said. A Department of Justice spokesperson would not comment on how the federal government would handle potential state enforcement of the mask ban, but did note in a statement sent Tuesday evening that “protecting the safety and security of our federal law enforcement officers, ridding our country of dangerous illegal aliens, will continue to be a top priority for this Administration.” Newsom has led the Democratic effort to fight back against the Trump administration, accusing President Donald Trump of “authoritarian tendencies” and abusing his authority on numerous occasions. “What could be more an abuse of power to sign a law that is clearly unconstitutional, which would give the states power that they don't have under the Constitution to enforce laws,” Fahey said. “So if they actually try to enact this, it's a complete abuse of power.”</p>
