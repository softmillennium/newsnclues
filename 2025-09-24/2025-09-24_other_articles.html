On one of these trips, we got a behind-the-scenes look at the Castillo de San Marcos, which led to us firing a cannon…allegedly. The St. Augustine Lighthouse has been my beacon for runs and rides, and it's been a place I've wanted to explore ever since I saw that famous episode of TAPS (The Atlantic Paranormal Society), aka Ghost Hunters, around 2006 to 2008, and then again in 2019.

Inspired by the real-life horrors of a notorious Maryland psychiatric hospital that preyed upon Black communities for decades, Crowsville #1 kicks off a five-part comic series on November 5 from Oni Press.

Written by Rodney Barnes (“The Boondocks,” Killadelphia) and illustrated by Elia Bonetti (Death of Wolverine: The Logan Legacy), we have an exclusive look inside the first issue below.

Founded at the turn of the 20th century outside of Annapolis, Maryland, the Crownsville Hospital was a notoriously segregated, all-Black psychiatric institute. After decades of overcrowding and neglect — alongside darker, more-persistent rumors of patient abuse and illegal medical experiments — it was finally closed.

Today, it stands condemned—a crumbling testament to a legacy of all-too-real terror inflicted on a marginalized and vulnerable community. But even as a ruin of its former self, Crownsville still casts a long shadow…

When an unexplained death inside the abandoned hospital is ruled a suicide, Annapolis police detective Mike Simms and journalist Paul Blairare are compelled to dig deeper, only to discover the reality of the horrors that once took place there… and the powerful connection they share to the anguished spirits of the dead that are still locked within its walls.

The 48-page first issue of Crownsville features covers by Bonetti, Barnes' Killadelphia co-creator Jason Shawn Alexander (Spawn), Syzmon Kudranski (The Punisher), and Andrea Sorrentino (Gideon Falls).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A statement from a national organization of architects regarding the alleged misuse of the word “architect” in negative news contexts has sparked discussion among Filipinos. The United Architects of the Philippines (UAP) released an open letter, saying it “strongly denounces the persistent misuse of the word ‘architect'” when “describing masterminds of plunder, corruption, crime, or other negative acts.” It was signed by its national president, architect Jonathan Manalad. “Recent headlines and articles — such as referring to a government official as an ‘architect of plunder' — reflect a long-standing trend of equating the word ‘architect' with the mastermind of wrongdoings,” the organization said on Tuesday, September 23. Recent headlines in the Philippines have focused on alleged corruption in flood control projects, with claims that government officials and lawmakers received kickbacks from these initiatives. “This is not only misleading but gravely unjust to a profession that has, for centuries, been dedicated to the highest ideals of public service, safety, progress, and nation building,” the UAP added. “Words matter,” the group said, adding that using “architect” in news reports as a synonym for ‘mastermind of crime' supposedly “corrodes public perception of the profession, trivializes years of education, licensure, and ethical responsibility, and undermines the trust that architects have worked hard to earn from the Filipino people.” The statement drew mixed reactions from Filipinos, with some arguing that there are more pressing issues, such as the reported government corruption involving flood control projects. Kaya when they chose to fight for a word, not against corruption, that spoke louder than anything else,” actor-content creator Chuckie Dreyfus wrote in a post. “For the record: Merriam-Webster defines architect not just as the profession, but also as ‘a person who designs and guides a plan or undertaking,'” he added, citing a dictionary definition of the term “architect.” Instead, lumabas tuloy na mas priority nila ang semantics kaysa sa accountability,” Chuckie continued. He'd laugh at this pa-woke fragility and say: corruption is the real insult, not vocabulary,” he concluded, sharing a screengrab of Merriam-Webster's definition of the word “architect.” “This is a little bit of an overreaction. No one in her [or] his right mind will ever interpret it the way you do. I mean, all you have to do is open a dictionary and see that ‘architect' is not just about the profession. “Rhetoric lang namn ‘yan, meaning, nag-isip ng isang bagay para ma-execute ang plano,” a different Pinoy commented. “Aware ba kayo that you're actually embarrassing yourselves for this statement? May multiple meanings ang word na ‘architect,' both literal and figurative, just like author, engineer, doctor, or pilot. “The list goes on… Pwede naman kasi mag-check ng dictionary, no? Words evolve and carry metaphorical weight, and I don't think any society has authority to dictate or restrict how people use them outside licensing. One is related to the profession, while the other is “a person responsible for achieving a particular plan or aim.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Decades before Mark Sebastian Jordan wrote about the murderous and paranormal history of North Central Ohio, his convictions wrangled with discoveries he made every day. “I very much kind of came at things from a scientific perspective.” As a youngster, he thought he might grow up to be a paleontologist, volcanologist or some other scientist. “I saw no provable scientific basis for ghosts, so I didn't really give it much thought,” Jordan said. Now, 40 years of research later, he has so much evidence of hauntings throughout the region that he published them in a book called "In These Haunted Hills: Ghosts of the Ohio Highlands." The transition from doubter to devotee happened one day after college when Jordan clocked out for his lunch break. “I was still living at home with my folks at this time, about halfway between Mansfield and Shelby,” he said. Exhausted, he sat down and turned on the television. “I can hear the sound of Mom fiddling around with some pots and pans in the kitchen,” Jordan said. Like a good uncle, he reached back to acknowledge the baby's playful advances. The experience forced him to reevaluate his worldview. “That was the first point when I was confronted with the realization, ‘Oh, maybe there are things going on that I can't easily explain or dismiss,' and that was all it took,” Jordan said. Searching for and recognizing new encounters became one of his favorite hobbies. “It's almost like a radio thing,” Jordan said. “I've been all over the state and beyond doing ghost hunting,” Jordan said. He is known throughout the Buckeye State as an author, playwright, columnist, newspaperman, music critic and folk artist. “I've been for the last few years trying to have out a new book every fall.” He took a sip of coffee with one hand, then lovingly patted his kitten, Lady Jane, with the other. He decided in August that nothing would stop him from having a new book, so he called a second publisher and asked the absolute fastest they could edit and print his first run. The new book is his ninth completed, but eighth published. The book, "In These Haunted Hills: Ghosts of the Ohio Highlands," is a mixture of his own personal experiences, folklore from the region, eyewitness accounts he has collected and history he has researched. “In a couple cases, I've been able to go and find the roots of stories that everyone just dismissed as folklore,” Jordan said. The stories are from Richland, Ashland, Holmes, Coshocton, Knox and Crawford counties. “I have one chapter that is just specifically about hauntings in private residences throughout the region that I've experienced,” Jordan said. There's also a look at The Renaissance Theatre in downtown Mansfield. And some of the stories will be news to many readers, like the tale of Sarah's grave in a haunted cemetery near Greer that eventually became popular among high school students. “Guys would take their dates and, hopefully, the dates would get scared and hug them a little closer,” Jordan said. “I dug through the detritus of time and found that there is a true story that whole situation arose from and there actually was a Sarah.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you're a fan of classic sci-fi shows like The X-Files and The Twilight Zone and are looking for a book that can scratch that itch, Little Visitor & Other Abductions may be just what the doctor ordered. This graphic novel brings together three of cartoonist Adam Szym's alien abduction tales - "A Cordial Invitation," "Little Visitor," and "Frolicker" - into one creepy package. Check it out in the slideshow gallery below: Little Visitor & Other Abductions is written and drawn by Szym. The cast and crew of an obscure film recount a tragedy that occurred during its doomed production. A young girl searches for her father in the darkness of the desert and stumbles upon an otherworldly cocktail party. Two strangers nurture violent thoughts in a bitter, lonely child as his village's harvest festival nears. Including the Ignatz Award–nominated A Cordial Invitation, Little Visitor, and a brand-new tale—Frolicker—this uncanny trilogy of graphic novellas is perfect for fans of The Twilight Zone, The X-Files, and all things beyond our understanding. Little Visitor & Other Abductions is available in bookstores and comic shops now. In other comic book news, DC has finally answered the burning question of whether Batman wears socks, and we've got the full scoop on what it means that Norman Osborn has become the new Spider-Man. Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.</p>
