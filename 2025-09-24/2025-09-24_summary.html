A broad draft Authorization for Use of Military Force could give wide latitude to go after supposed “narco-terrorists.”

A draft proposal to authorize the use of U.S. military force against drug cartels is currently floating around Congress and the White House, according to a recent New York Times report. Although an official version of the proposal has yet to be released, publicly available information suggests that it could be used to justify U.S. military intervention in at least 60 countries.

The U.S.-led “War on Drugs” has escalated rapidly over the last month: after the White House signed a secret directive authorizing attacks on Latin American drug cartels, the U.S. built up its military presence in the region and began conducting a series of deadly airstrikes on alleged drug-smuggling civilian boats in the international waters of the Caribbean. Human Rights Watch called the strikes “unlawful extrajudicial killings.”

How far Washington should go in its new counternarcotics campaign has been a source of controversy within the Trump administration. When the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) proposed the use of the U.S. military to attack cartels within Mexican territory during a White House meeting earlier this year, officials from the Defense Department and other agencies reportedly objected, in part because the executive branch lacked sufficient legal authorization to do so.

An “Authorization for Use of Military Force” (AUMF) is the instrument most often used to provide legal justification for military hostilities today. AUMF legislation passed in response to the 9/11 attacks laid the groundwork for a “Global War on Terror” that included targeting many suspects who had nothing to do with 9/11. Because of its extremely broad language, the 2001 AUMF has since been used to justify military interventions in at least 22 countries.

A proposal reportedly brought forth by Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) for a new AUMF aimed at “narco-terrorists” began circulating around Washington last week. Apparently modeled on the 2001 AUMF, Mills' new AUMF is similarly broad: although it only lasts for five years, the authorization does not identify specific targets and contains no geographic restrictions.

In comments given to the Times, Harvard Professor Jack Goldsmith described the proposal as “insanely broad,” essentially “an open-ended war authorization against an untold number of countries, organizations and persons that the president could deem within its scope.” The version of the AUMF that has been attributed to Rep. Mills would give the president the ability to use “all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations or persons the President determines are designated narco-terrorists,” including those who provide financing or support to narco-terrorists.

Earlier this year, the White House added a long list of Latin American drug cartels to the national “Foreign Terrorist Organizations” (FTO) list. Although the full text of Mills' AUMF hasn't been confirmed, under his reported proposal, the president could have the authority to wage war against any of these organizations, regardless of where they are operating. Given the highly globalized nature of the drug trade and the contested definition of who is included within “drug cartels,” this could include U.S. military action in dozens of different countries. Based on what is known about it so far, Mills' proposal would leave “a large amount of discretion in the hands of the executive to make determinations about who ‘counts' within the scope of targeting,” said Elizabeth Beavers, assistant professor of law at Widener University's Delaware Law School.

The Sinaloa Cartel, for example, designated as a FTO by the Trump administration in February, operates in “at least 47 countries,” according to the DEA. In a five–part series of articles on the “foreign policies of the Sinaloa Cartel and CJNG [another Mexican cartel]”, scholar Vanda Felbab-Brown lists some of the countries that are allegedly involved in the Sinaloa's activities: Albania, Australia, Belgium, Cape Verde, Chile, China, Colombia, the DRC, Ecuador, France, Germany, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Ireland, India, Italy, Mali, Morocco, Mozambique, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the “Northern Triangle” nations of Central America, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Peru, Portugal, Romania, Senegal, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, and the UK. Other countries with Sinaloa Cartel activity include Belize, Canada, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Guyana, Panama, and Thailand.

If the proposed AUMF had targeted the Sinaloa Cartel alone, it could theoretically authorize U.S. military interventions in at least 42 nations. But this is only one of many cartels that has been designated as a terrorist organization by the Trump administration. War against the CJNG would add Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Turkey, Uruguay, and Venezuela to the list. Cartels like Tren de Aragua have an established presence in Costa Rica. Meanwhile, the Trump administration designated several more countries as high-priority drug transit routes, specifically arguing that our “assistance” was “vital to the national interests of the United States” in Afghanistan, Bolivia, Colombia, Myanmar, and Venezuela.

Taken together, the combined forces of the proposed AUMF and the terrorist designations for cartels could allow the U.S. president to intervene in almost every nation in the continental Americas. Taken literally, the AUMF might even be abused to justify hostilities within the United States, as the terrorist-designated MS-13 gang was created in Los Angeles and maintains extensive operations throughout the U.S. In practice, however, this is highly unlikely.

“There are still a whole host of constitutional protections against extrajudicial targeting of persons within the U.S. that an AUMF doesn't just sweep away,” said Beavers. Still, this assumes that the president would be willing to abide by these protections. “This entire conversation about lawfulness rests entirely on what the other branches of government, including the courts, are willing to do about such violations,” she added.

U.S. authorities have long tried to expand their power by blending together the War on Drugs and the War on Terror, often using the controversial idea of “narco-terrorism” to make the connection. In 2011, the DEA claimed that 39% of Foreign Terrorist Organizations had “confirmed links to the drug trade.” This newly-proposed AUMF could therefore be applied to many traditional terrorist organizations, including al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, and the Taliban. This means the AUMF could provide additional authorities (on top of those from prior AUMFs) for the U.S. to involve itself in the countries where these groups operate. Such a list would likely include the Taliban's involvement in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Hezbollah's involvement in Lebanon, and a long list of countries alleged by the U.S. government to have al-Qaeda affiliates: Algeria, Burkina Faso, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen.

The U.S. has also long accused the Colombian National Liberation Army (ELN) of narco-trafficking. Because of Cuba's involvement in negotiations between the ELN and the Colombian government, Washington has insisted upon the classification of the island nation as a “State Sponsor of Terrorism.” Thus, the White House could theoretically use this proposed AUMF to engage in military hostilities in Cuba. Similarly, U.S. attempts at linking Venezuela's government leadership with an alleged “Cartel of the Suns” could be used to engage in a war against the Venezuelan military, not just the cartels alleged to operate within the nation.

Adding together all of these potential applications of the proposed AUMF, the bill would create justifications for the White House to engage in offensive military activity in more than 60 nations. While there's currently no indication that Congress is eager to take up, let alone pass, an extremely broad new military force authorization, if it were to become law, it would fully merge two of the largest policy failures in U.S. history — the War on Drugs and the War on Terror — into one singular concept that could expand armed conflict throughout the entire Western hemisphere and beyond.

            The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has fired back at Donald Trump's false claims that Sharia law is being introduced in the British capital, calling the US president “racist,” “sexist,” “misogynistic” and “Islamophobic.”
    


            Trump used his speech at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York on Tuesday to label Khan a “terrible mayor” and falsely claim London wants “to go to Sharia law.”
    


            Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a Western capital city, told reporters Wednesday: “People are wondering what it is about this Muslim mayor who leads a liberal, multi-cultural, progressive and successful city that means I appear to be living rent-free inside Donald Trump's head.”
    


            He added, “I think, as Donald Trump has shown, he is racist, he is sexist, he is misogynistic and he is Islamophobic.”
    


            CNN has contacted the White House for comment.
    


            London City Hall had earlier responded to Trump's remarks, saying in a statement: “London is the greatest city in the world, safer than major US cities, and we're delighted to welcome the record number of US citizens moving here.”
    


            Sharia law is based on Islam's holy book, the Quran, and the life of prophet Mohammed. It refers to a set of principles that govern the moral and religious lives of Muslims on matters as varied as prayer, finance, divorce or halal food.
    


            According to a UK government document published in 2019, Sharia councils have existed in the country since the 1980s but are used to “solve the matrimonial problems of Muslims living in the United Kingdom in the light of Islamic family law.”
    


            Their rulings are not legally binding as the councils “have no official legal or constitutional role in the UK,” according to the government.
    


            UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting defended Khan in a post on X Tuesday, writing: “Sadiq Khan is not trying to impose Sharia Law on London.”
    


            “This is a Mayor who marches with Pride, who stands up for difference of background and opinion, who's focused on improving our transport, our air, our streets, our safety, our choices and chances. Proud he's our Mayor,” Streeting said.
    


            Trump was in the United Kingdom last week for an unprecedented second state visit. Second-term US presidents aren't typically afforded the pomp of two official trips. A state banquet was held in his honor at Windsor Castle, but his itinerary didn't include a journey to the British capital – where crowds of protesters had gathered.
    


            Khan, who was elected in 2016, is a strong critic of Trump, notably giving permission for protesters to fly a 20-foot-tall “Trump baby” balloon in London during his first presidential visit to the United Kingdom in 2016.
    


            There have been several verbal clashes between the two men in the last decade.
    


            On the campaign trail before his first term as president, Trump pledged to ban Muslims from the US once in office. Khan at the time deemed it an “outrageous policy.”
    


            Khan later called Trump's views on Islam “ignorant,” to which the president hit back, saying, “I will remember those statements. They are very nasty statements.”
    


Protests, projections and programs: How Britons are showing their displeasure at Trump's visit



            In a 2019 opinion piece in British publication The Guardian, the London mayor condemned what he called the red-carpet roll-out that welcomed Trump and his wife Melania on their first UK state visit.
    


            “Donald Trump is just one of the most egregious examples of a growing global threat,” Khan wrote. The mayor further criticized the president in another op-ed earlier this month, accusing the Trump administration's policies of being “straight out of the autocrat's playbook.”
    


            During a joint conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in July, Trump reignited the feud, calling Khan a “nasty person” who was doing a “terrible job.”
    


            Starmer interrupted Trump, saying of Khan, “He's a friend of mine, actually.”

            Italy said it deployed one of its naval vessels on Wednesday to come to the aid of an aid flotilla that was targeted by drones while trying to reach Gaza, with activists claiming that Israel was behind the strikes.
    


            Volunteers from the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) – an organization trying to get aid into the besieged enclave using ships setting sail from ports across the Mediterranean – say that some of their vessels were targeted by drones. The organization claimed the attacks are part of a sustained Israeli campaign of intimidation.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.
    


            The boats were just days from reaching the enclave when the latest reported attacks occurred on Tuesday. 



            “In the final days before reaching Gaza, the GSF is experiencing an alarmingly dangerous escalation, with multiple boats reporting targeted explosions and unidentified objects being dropped on and near the boats, causing significant damage and widespread obstruction in communication,” the organization said in a statement Tuesday.
    


            The incident has raised urgent concerns for the safety of the more than 500 unarmed participants aboard the flotillas, the GSF said.
    


            There are variety of nationals on board the vessels, including citizens from Italy, Sweden and Spain, CNN understands.
    


            Speaking from one of the vessels following the reported attack, a Spanish lawmaker urged international action to help the activists.
    


            “I think this has to escalate further and further and reach … European Commission levels, because this needs to be tackled, coordinated with all the countries, at least in Europe,” lawmaker Juan Bordera told Reuters.
    


            Bordera added that those on the flotilla were “stressed” and lived through a “crazy, crazy nightmare” amid Tuesday night's explosions.
    


            On Tuesday, Israel's foreign ministry said on X that the country would take “necessary measures” to stop the flotilla from reaching Gaza. The ministry said it would be willing to transfer the aid from the flotilla to Gaza through the Ashkelon port in Israel, but it accused flotilla organizers of refusing such a transfer and “pursuing a violent course of action.”
    


            “If the flotilla continues to reject Israel's peaceful proposal, Israel will take the necessary measures to prevent its entry into the combat zone and to stop any violation of a lawful naval blockade, while making every possible effort to ensure the safety of its passengers,” the ministry added.
    


            Francesca Albanese, United Nations special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, wrote on X that the flotilla had come under attack 14 times between Tunis and Crete. “Four vessels are now damaged and require urgent repair. As of last night, an unexploded device remains on one of the boats,” she wrote.
    


            UN Human Rights Office spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan has called for an “independent, impartial and thorough investigation” into the reported attacks.
    


            Italy has authorized the dispatch of an Italian naval vessel, which according to a statement from Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto, is now en route to the area for possible rescue operations. The statement added that the drone attack was carried out by “currently unidentified perpetrators.”
    


            Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni spoke of her “total condemnation” of the drone strike on Tuesday night, calling it “gratuitous, dangerous and irresponsible.” Meloni added that Italy is “conducting our own investigation to determine who is responsible.”
    


            Italian officials say the Gaza-bound vessels are carrying Italian citizens, along with parliamentarians. “To ensure their safety, the foreign ministry had already notified the Israeli authorities that any operation entrusted to Israel's armed forces be conducted in compliance with international law and the principle of absolute caution,” a statement from Italy's foreign ministry said.
    


            Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani is working to mediate with the Israeli government to allow the humanitarian supplies transported by the flotilla to enter Gaza, a spokesperson for his office told CNN.
    


            “The minister is in contact with the Israeli government and has identified a credible mediation mechanism. The Italian government is examining all options to avoid further offensive actions against the flotilla's vessels,” the office added.
    


            Meanwhile, Sweden's foreign ministry said it is following the developments very closely, adding that approximately 15 Swedish nationals were aboard the vessels.
    


            In May, activists on board an aid ship say they were targeted by an Israeli drone in international waters off the coast of Malta. The IDF did not deny involvement in the drone attack. An Israeli Air Force cargo plane was picked up on flight trackers circling the waters near Malta for an extended period of time before the attack.

            Federal investigators seized multiple documents labeled “secret,” “confidential,” and “classified,” including some about weapons of mass destruction, during the late August search of the office of President Donald Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton, according to newly released court records that are part of an investigation into whether Bolton mishandled defense records.
    


            The new details provide additional insight into what evidence federal investigators have collected as they look at possible criminal charges for Bolton, who became a political antagonist of Trump's after he published a book in summer 2020 about how the president bungled several interactions with and about foreign governments.
    


            A manuscript Bolton wrote for the book, titled “The Room Where It Happened,” initially contained classified details, federal officials told Bolton at the time, but he hasn't been charged with any crime.
    


            During the recent search of Bolton's office, agents found a binder about a State Department security briefing for the 2000-2001 administration transition, plus documents about a communications plan, the US Mission to the United Nations, travel and weapons of mass destruction, according to an inventory list that was filed in court and obtained by media outlets this week. CNN and other news organizations had sued for access to the records about the search.
    


            The inventory list written by FBI agents specifically said the property removed from Bolton's Washington, DC, office on August 22 included: “Travel memo documents with pages labeled secret”; “US Mission to the United Nations - Confidential Documents”; “U.S. Government Strategic Communications Plan - Confidential Documents”; and “Confidential Documents with (redacted) heading Weapons of Mass Destruction Classified Documents.”
    


            Confidential and Secret are both levels of classification for national security information.
    


            The federal agents also took four computers and a USB flash drive from Bolton's office, according to the records.
    


            According to a person familiar with Bolton's office, the paper documents Bolton had there were not from the Trump administration. Instead, they may have been 20 years old or older – from his earlier tenures in the federal government when he was an under secretary at the State Department and the United Nations ambassador during the second Bush administration.
    


            The age of the documents may be important, given that it's possible they had been declassified by the federal government over the years, the person said, speaking anonymously because the investigation is ongoing. Bolton, 76, has maintained a private office since 2014 for political and policy work, according to public filings.
    


            Bolton's lawyer Abbe Lowell has repeatedly said in recent public statements responding to the investigative activity that the records Bolton had would have been typical of those kept by a long-time government official.
    


            “The documents with classification markings from the period 1998 - 2006 date back to Amb. Bolton's time in the George W. Bush Administration,” Lowell said in a statement on Wednesday. “An objective and thorough review will show nothing inappropriate was stored or kept by Ambassador Bolton.”
    


            Yet the Justice Department confirmed in court filings this week the sensitive grand jury investigation is ongoing. The documents say investigators are looking at possible violations of criminal statutes that prohibit the unauthorized retention of classified records and improper handling of national defense material.
    


            Court proceedings prompted by media outlets, including CNN, previously made public other records about the investigation around Bolton and the search of his home, which occurred on the same day that federal authorities searched his office.
    


            The agents at the house had removed several phones, computers and drives, a binder labeled “statements and reflections to allied strikes …” and folders of documents labeled “Trump I-IV,” those court records said.
    


            Federal investigators said they had reason to believe they would find classified records in the search of his house in Bethesda, Maryland.
    


            His interactions with a classification expert in the federal government to remove classified details from his book manuscript in 2020 were part of the FBI's reasoning for the search, as was a foreign adversary's hack of his AOL account. CNN previously reported that the US intelligence community believes Bolton's emails may have been intercepted by China, Russia or Iran.

Ukraine carried out strikes on multiple targets in Russia linked to oil refining and drone production, Ukraine's General Staff confirmed on Sept. 24.

The confirmation follows a reported overnight attack on the Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat petrochemical plant in Russia's Republic of Bashkortostan.

The General Staff said the strike hit the oil refining facility in the Republic of Bashkortostan, specifically the ELOU-AVT-6 primary oil refining unit. Preliminary reports indicate the attack caused a fire at the site.

The Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat facility is one of Russia's largest oil refining and petrochemical plants, producing 150 different types of products, including gasoline and diesel fuel. It is located some 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from the front line in Ukraine.

The targeted facility processes up to 10 million tons of oil annually and is a key producer of liquid rocket fuel for Russia, according to the General Staff.

In addition to the strike on the oil refinery in the Republic of Bashkortostan, Ukrainian forces also targeted key infrastructure sites involved in the country's energy and defense sectors.

The Kuzmichi-1 oil pumping station, part of the crude oil transport network supplying Russia's southern regions, was among the facilities hit. Another strike targeted the Zenzevatka pumping station, which services the Kuybyshev-Tikhoretsk main oil pipeline.

Ukrainian forces struck a drone production facility in the village of Valuyki in Russia's Belgorod Oblast as well. While the full extent of the damage is still being assessed, a fire reportedly broke out at the site following the attack.

Ukraine's General Staff also confirmed that a long-range strike on Sept. 22 targeted the Astrakhan gas processing plant in southern Russia, forcing a partial shutdown of operations.

The facility, located in Russia's Astrakhan Oblast, is one of the world's largest gas chemical complexes and the country's primary producer of sulfur used in explosives, accounting for up to 66% of national output. The plant processes up to 3.2 million tons of oil products annually, according to the General Staff.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

Ukrainian forces have intensified attacks on Russia's oil industry over the past year, forcing operational suspensions and exacerbating a nationwide fuel shortage.

Kyiv considers Russian oil refineries, petrochemical facilities, as well as military production sites, to be valid military targets as they help fund Moscow's war machine.

One of the largest oil refineries in Russia, the Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat petrochemical plant in the Republic of Bashkortostan, came under Ukrainian attack overnight on Sept. 24.

The cyberattack disrupted automated check-in systems caused flight cancellations and delays at several major European airports.



 The Kyiv Independent's deputy chief editor, Oleksiy Sorokin, sits down with British historian Niall Ferguson on the sidelines of the Yalta European Strategy (YES) conference to discuss the geopolitical realities shaping Russia's war against Ukraine.  



Despite security precautions, a direct hit against a shelter made it impossible to fully prevent casualties, according to the military.

While conscripts are officially barred from being deployed abroad, reports indicate that many are pressured into signing contracts with Russia's Defense Ministry and sent to fight in Ukraine.

The A330 aircraft was traveling to Lithuania's Siauliai air base, reportedly also carrying relatives of Spanish air force personnel deployed as part of a NATO air policing mission.

The Caspian Pipeline Consortium confirmed that its office in the city was damaged. 

"I don't know the cost of such actions, but it is clear that it was too high," said Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine's former commander-in-chief.

A Russian unit broke into a house and killed the girl's parents before abducting her, Ukraine's 3rd Army Corps reported on Sept. 24.

Responding to Trump's comment that Russia looks like a "paper tiger," Kremlin spokesperson Peskov said that "Russia is more commonly associated with a bear. There is no such thing as a 'paper bear,' and Russia is a real bear."

The tax increase, part of the draft budget submitted to the Russian government, is aimed "primarily at funding defense and security needs," the Russian Finance Ministry said.

Conservative youth group chapters will counter ‘woke indoctrination', says Ryan Walters

The state superintendent in Oklahoma announced plans to put Turning Point USA chapters in every high school in the state, saying it would counter “radical leftist teachers unions” and their “woke indoctrination”.

After far-right activist Charlie Kirk was killed on a college campus earlier this month, requests to start chapters of his conservative youth group, Turning Point, at colleges and high schools have surged, the organization has said.

Oklahoma is the first state where the government is getting involved to promote starting these chapters. In a press release on Tuesday, Ryan Walters, the Oklahoma superintendent, detailed how students could start a chapter of “Club America”, the organization's high school program, by gathering at least three students from the same school and completing a charter agreement. Then, Turning Point will help the club get a teacher sponsor and official recognition, and send materials such as an “activism kit”.

“We will be putting TPUSA on every high school campus in Oklahoma,” Walter said in the press release. “Charlie Kirk inspired a generation to love America, to speak boldly, and to never shy away from debate. Our kids must get involved and active. We will fight back against the liberal propaganda, pushed by the radical left, and the teachers unions. Our fight starts now.”

In a video posted on X, Walters railed further against the “radical leftists” who “dominate classrooms and push woke indoctrination”. “They fight parents' rights, they push parents out of the classroom and they lie to our kids about American history,” he said. The Turning Point chapters would allow kids to participate in “dialogue about American greatness, a dialogue around American values”.

When asked by a local reporter what would happen in a school that said it wouldn't open a chapter of the group, Walters said he would go after the school's accreditation. “They would be in danger of not being a school district if they decided to reject a club that is here to promote civic engagement,” he said. “Everything would be on the table in that scenario.”

Nadine Gallagher, a teacher in Oklahoma, told local news station KOCO that if students wanted to start a club, she's “all for it”. But, she said, “I don't like forced anything.”

Andrew Kolvet, the spokesman for Turning Point USA, said the group has received a “massive surge of inquiries to start new chapters”, particularly after Sunday's memorial for Kirk.

“We are now at over 120,000 inquiries. Even accounting for attrition and duplicates, we are on the cusp of having a TPUSA or Club America chapter in every HS and College campus in America,” Kolvet wrote on X.

Turning Point chapters organize around conservative principles, and the organization's activism kits “promote issues ranging from voter registration, free speech and gun access, to kits entitled ‘Make America Healthy Again'”, according to USA Today. Other projects of Turning Point include a “professor watchlist” and school board watchlist that identifies people who have leftwing views. Turning Point chapters on college campuses also host conservative speakers.

Kirk often went on college speaking tours to debate students and advanced views in person and on his podcast that were at times racist, sexist or otherwise derogatory, including that there was a “great replacement strategy” underway via immigration, that Islam is a “a threat to America” and that “in urban America, prowling Blacks go around for fun to go target white people”.

Walters has come under fire for repeated instances of pushing religion and rightwing politics in Oklahoma schools. He has sought to require schools in the state to show a video of him praying. He pushed to create the country's first Catholic public charter school, which the US supreme court ruled against in May.

He bought Donald Trump-branded Bibles that he wants to put in classrooms. He has installed prominent rightwing figures such as the activist behind the anti-LGBTQ+ group Libs of TikTok and the leader of the Heritage Foundation on state education committees.

He has also said that he wants to require teachers coming to teach in Oklahoma from liberal states to complete an “America First” certification. He pushed to include 2020 election fraud conspiracies in the state's high school social studies curriculum.

Walters also put out a press release on 17 September claiming that teachers who made derogatory comments about Kirk after his death would be fired.

Walters said his office had received 224 reports of “defamatory comments” about Kirk by school staff, 30 reports of “not observing a moment of silence” and three reports of schools that refused to lower their flags for Kirk. The department identified 70 certified teachers who “have made statements regarding Charlie Kirk's murder”.

“Any teacher posting defamatory and egregious comments will NOT be teaching in Oklahoma classrooms and any school that refused to participate in a moment of silence and/or lower their flags for Charlie Kirk is currently under investigation,” the press release said.

Oklahoma ranks among the lowest states in public education quality, with one recent survey putting the state at 50th place.

A growing number of Poles believe Ukraine should give up claims to regions that voted to join Russia in referendums, in order to reach a peace settlement, according to a new survey.

A United Surveys poll for Wirtualna Polska published on Tuesday found that almost 42% of respondents believe Ukraine should drop its territorial claims for security guarantees and peace. Of the 1,000 Polish adults of voting age surveyed in late-August, 48% were against giving up land claims for peace, with 10% undecided.A survey published only last month by Rzeczpospolita found 37.4% supported concessions, while 50.5% opposed them.

Moscow has long insisted that Kiev recognize Crimea, Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, and Zaporozhye as Russian territory in any peace deal. Kiev has rejected this, with Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky vowing last month to retake Crimea – largely populated by ethnic Russians – which voted to join Russia after the 2014 Western-backed coup in Kiev. He also pledged to reclaim the four other regions, which joined Russia in 2022, saying “it's only a matter of time.”

Poland has been one of Ukraine's top donors since 2022, providing over €5.1 billion ($5.7 billion) in aid – more than 70% of it as weapons – according to Germany's Kiel Institute. Warsaw is also part of the “coalition of the willing,” advocating continued military aid.

However, support for Kiev among Polish citizens has been steadily declining. Backing for Ukraine's EU membership dropped to 35% and NATO membership to 37% in June this year, down from 85% and 75% respectively in February 2022, according to a recent IBRiS survey. Prime Minister Donald Tusk admitted to “a growing wave of pro-Russian sentiment and antipathy towards a struggling Ukraine” in a post on X earlier this month.

On Sunday, an anti-war rally took place in Warsaw, with demonstrators waving national flags and carrying placards denouncing Poland's involvement in the conflict and military aid for Kiev. Videos and photos posted on social media showed banners reading “Poland is for peace” and “We say no to warmongers.”

Moscow has repeatedly warned that foreign aid only prolongs the conflict and urged a diplomatic solution. It insists any settlement must include Ukrainian neutrality, demilitarization, and recognition of the current territorial reality – including the status of its new regions.

            When Jimmy Kimmel taped his back-to-work monologue Tuesday night, he predicted that the restoration of his show would “unfortunately and unjustly” put ABC at risk of additional pressure from the government.
    


            One hour before the monologue aired, President Trump proved him right, posting a blustery new legal threat against ABC on Truth Social.
    


            Trump's message swerved between dismissive — Kimmel's “audience is GONE,” he claimed — and intimidating. He claimed Kimmel “puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE. He is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do.”
    


            ABC has not responded to CNN's request for comment about Trump's post, which lacked any clear legal basis.
    


            This latest legal threat may come and go, but it is another crystal-clear example of the president using his government power to cajole a privately owned media company into changing its content.
    


            In this case, it's for a very specific reason: The president can't stand being criticized night after night.
    


            As Kimmel noted on the air, the president has also called for NBC to fire Jimmy Fallon. Kimmel urged viewers to speak up on Fallon's behalf if there is “any hint” of action against his rival.
    


            On Wednesday morning, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer reacted to Trump's newest missive against ABC by saying, “This is a test of democracy.”
    


            That threat, Schumer said on MSNBC, “is what dictatorships do. That is what autocracies do.”
    


            Trump wants anyone he “doesn't agree with he wants to shut up,” Schumer added. “That's a dagger to the heart of America.”
    


            Trump's post also highlighted how last December's Disney settlement has emboldened him to make further demands of media companies. “Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars,” the president wrote. “This one sounds even more lucrative.”
    


            The president's tone is revealing. “They gave me” $16 million sounds so casual, when in fact ABC's payout was anything but.
    


            The company decided to settle Trump's defamation lawsuit against ABC News to avoid the legal discovery process and an unpredictable trial, not out of the goodness of Mickey Mouse's heart. Numerous critics, including some inside ABC, now look back at that settlement with regret, believing it kicked off a wave of media capitulation to the president.
    


            In any case, Trump's latest threat is a clear indication that he intends to punish ABC for allowing Kimmel to return to the air.
    


            It also once again contradicts the popular MAGA media claim that Trump and Brendan Carr had nothing to do with Kimmel's benching. As Justin Amash, the former GOP congressman, said on X, the president's words “torpedoed every White House surrogate who claimed the administration wasn't attempting to coerce Disney/ABC.”
    


            Kimmel geared up his audience for this continued grudge match last night. He assailed Trump's “un-American” attacks on free speech and borrowed a line from the late great comedian Jack Paar, the second host of “The Tonight Show,” who quit hosting the show for nearly a month in 1960 over a dispute with NBC's censors. When Paar returned to work, he opened by saying, “As I was saying before I was interrupted…”
    


            And that's exactly how Kimmel opened last night, as well.
    


            “By borrowing Paar's comeback, Kimmel placed his own suspension in the lineage of late-night defiance,” late-night TV analyst Jed Rosenzweig wrote in a column for his website LateNighter. It was a calculated echo of late-night history by Kimmel: “Rather than treating his absence as punishment, he reframed it as an interruption — a pause in the conversation with his audience that he now controls again.”
    


            Much to Trump's chagrin, Kimmel got the last laugh — for now.

Pope names James Checchio to succeed Gregory Aymond two weeks after archdiocese agreed to settle with survivors

Pope Leo XIV on Wednesday named an eventual successor to New Orleans' embattled Catholic archbishop, Gregory Aymond, two weeks after his archdiocese agreed to settle with survivors of clergy sexual abuse for $230m.

Leo, history's first US pope, named bishop James Checchio of Metuchen, New Jersey, as the coadjutor bishop of New Orleans. The role positions Checchio to assist Aymond initially and then succeed him when he retires.

Checchio, 59, handled the fallout in Metuchen of the explosive 2018 sexual misconduct revelations of one of his predecessors there, Theodore McCarrick. Prior to arriving in Metuchen in 2016, Checchio had served as the rector of the US seminary in Rome for a decade.

Aymond reached the mandatory retirement age of 75 last November, suggesting that the Vatican kept him in place to finalize the abuse settlement and allow for an organized handover to his successor.

The New Orleans archdiocese agreed on 8 September to a $230m proposed settlement to end one of the US church's longest and most contentious battles over abuse claims. It had proposed in May to pay at least $179.2m in response to more than 500 abuse claims, but victims' attorneys opposed the deal as too low.

Survivors have until late October to vote on whether or not to approve the revised settlement. If approved by two-thirds of survivors, payments could begin disbursement by next year.

The archdiocese had filed for bankruptcy in May 2020, rather than handle each abuse claim separately, which survivors say allowed church leadership to avoid facing tough questions in court.

The archdiocese's largest insurer, Travelers, for now has held out against a settlement. If it ultimately decides to contribute to a settlement rather than risk facing litigation from individual abuse claimants, the amount of the settlement in the New Orleans archdiocese bankruptcy would ostensibly increase from $230m.

Aymond had resisted calls for his resignation over the church's management of its decades-old clergy abuse scandal, which in New Orleans has thrust the local archdiocese under law enforcement investigation for alleged child sex trafficking.

Media investigations in February revealed that the archdiocese received help from executives of professional American football's New Orleans Saints with respect to softening critical press coverage of the church's management of the clergy-abuse scandal.

            The General Services Administration has given the employees — who managed government workspaces — until the end of the week to accept or decline reinstatement, according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press.
    


            Those who accept must report for duty on October 6 after what amounts to a seven-month paid vacation, during which time the GSA in some cases racked up high costs — passed along to taxpayers — to stay in dozens of properties whose leases it had slated for termination or were allowed to expire.
    


            “Ultimately, the outcome was the agency was left broken and understaffed,” said Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official. “They didn't have the people they needed to carry out basic functions.”
    


            Becker, who represents owners with government leases at Arco Real Estate Solutions, said GSA has been in a “triage mode” for months. He said the sudden reversal of the downsizing reflects how Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency had gone too far, too fast.
    


            GSA was established in the 1940s to centralize the acquisition and management of thousands of federal workplaces. Its return to work request mirrors rehiring efforts at in several agencies targeted by DOGE. Last month, the IRS said it would allow some employees who took a resignation offer to remain on the job. The Labor Department has also brought back some employees who took buyouts, while the National Park Service earlier reinstated a number of purged employees.
    


            Critical to the work of such agencies is the GSA, which manages many of the buildings. Starting in March, thousands of GSA employees left the agency as part of programs that encouraged them to resign or take early retirement. Hundreds of others — those subject to the recall notice — were dismissed as part of an aggressive push to reduce the size of the federal workforce. Though those employees did not show up for work, some continue to get paid.
    


            GSA representatives didn't respond to detailed questions about the return-to-work notice, which the agency issued Friday. They also declined to discuss the agency's headcount, staffing decisions or the potential cost overruns generated by reversing its plans to terminate leases.
    


            “GSA's leadership team has reviewed workforce actions and is making adjustments in the best interest of the customer agencies we serve and the American taxpayers,” an agency spokesman said in an email.
    


            Democrats have assailed the Trump administration's indiscriminate approach to slashing costs and jobs. Rep. Greg Stanton of Arizona, the top Democrat on the subcommittee overseeing the GSA, told AP there is no evidence that reductions at the agency “delivered any savings.”
    


We do not know what exactly Elon Musk is doing to the federal government



            “It's created costly confusion while undermining the very services taxpayers depend on,” he said.
    


            DOGE identified the agency, which had about 12,000 employees at the start of the Trump administration, as a chief target of its campaign to reduce fraud, waste and abuse in the federal government.
    


            A small cohort of Musk's trusted aides embedded in GSA's headquarters, sometimes sleeping on cots on the agency's sixth floor, and pursued plans to abruptly cancel nearly half of the 7,500 leases in the federal portfolio. DOGE also wanted GSA to sell hundreds of federally owned buildings with the goal of generating billions in savings.
    


            GSA started by sending more than 800 lease cancellation notices to landlords, in many cases without informing the government tenants. The agency also published a list of hundreds of government buildings that were targeted for sale.
    


            Pushback to GSA's dumping of its portfolio was swift, and both initiatives have been dialed back. More than 480 leases slated for termination by DOGE have since been spared. Those leases were for offices scattered around the country that are occupied by such agencies as the IRS, Social Security Administration and Food and Drug Administration.
    


            DOGE's “Wall of Receipts,” which once boasted that the lease cancellations alone would save nearly $460 million, has since reduced that estimate to $140 million by the end of July, according to Becker, the former GSA real estate official.
    


Tracking Trump's overhaul of the federal workforce



            Meanwhile, GSA embarked on massive job cuts. The administration slashed GSA's headquarters staff by 79%, its portfolio managers by 65% and facilities managers by 35%, according to a federal official briefed on the situation. The official, who was not authorized to speak to the media, provided the statistics on condition of anonymity.
    


            As a result of the internal turmoil, 131 leases expired without the government actually vacating the properties, the official said. The situation has exposed the agencies to steep fees because property owners have not been able to rent out those spaces to other tenants.
    


            The public may soon get a clearer picture of what transpired at the agency.
    


            The Government Accountability Office, an independent congressional watchdog, is examining the GSA's management of its workforce, lease terminations and planned building disposals and expects to issue findings in the coming months, said David Marroni, a senior GAO official.

Authorities said all three people shot were detainees at the immigration facility located in Dallas and that alleged shooter killed self

Texas Ice facility shooting – latest updates

Two people have been killed and another was injured in a shooting at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) field office in Dallas on Wednesday morning, officials said.

Authorities added that the shooter died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The Dallas police department said that officers responded to a call at approximately 6.40am on Wednesday.

“The preliminary investigation determined that a suspect opened fire at a government building from an adjacent building,” the police said in a statement. “Two people were transported to the hospital with gunshot wounds. One victim died at the scene. The suspect is deceased.”

In a later statement, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that two of the victims are now deceased, and the other is in critical condition.

“The shooter fired indiscriminately at the ICE building, including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot. Three detainees were shot,” they said.

At a news conference on Wednesday morning, Joe Rothrock, the head of the FBI field office in Dallas, said that “rounds that were found near the suspected shooter contain messages that are anti-Ice in nature”.

One of the unspent shell casings recovered was engraved with the phrase “ANTI ICE”, according to a post from the FBI director, Kash Patel.

Authorities said that the FBI is investigating this incident as an act of targeted violence. They said they are not releasing the identities of any of the victims at this time, but confirmed that no members of law enforcement were injured during the attack.

At the conference, the Republican senator Ted Cruz, who represents Texas, said that “politically motivated violence is wrong”, adding that “this is the third shooting in Texas directed at Ice” or Customs and Border Protection.

Parkland hospital in Dallas confirmed to the Associated Press that it had received two patients from the incident at the Ice facility. The hospital spokesperson did not have any details about their conditions.

Kristi Noem, the DHS secretary, confirmed  in a statement that the suspected shooter died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound and said that details about the incident were “still emerging” but confirmed that there were “multiple injuries and fatalities” at the Ice field office.

“While we don't know motive yet, we know that our Ice law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them,” Noem said. “It must stop.”

Law enforcement officials told CNN that at least two of the victims were Ice detainees.

Todd Lyons, the acting Ice director, told the network that the “scene is secure” and said that three people were shot and taken to the hospital.

An Ice spokesperson has also told NBC News that all three people shot were detainees at the facility.

Dan Bongino, the deputy director of the FBI, said that the agency is “fully engaged, in conjunction with our state and federal law enforcement partners, at the crime scene in Dallas”.

JD Vance called the shooting an “obsessive attack on law enforcement” that “must stop”. Though, as noted above, no Ice agents were injured.

“I'm praying for everyone hurt in this attack and for their families,” the vice-president wrote on X.

John Cornyn, another Republican senator who represents Texas, called the shooting “horrific”.

“While law enforcement investigates, I am keeping everyone impacted in my prayers,” he said. “My staff have been in touch with federal & local officials in Dallas, and we will make sure all resources are brought to bear in the investigation.”

Texas's governor, Greg Abbott, said in a statement that “Texas fully supports Ice”.

“This assassination will NOT slow our arrest, detention, & deportation of illegal immigrants,” he said. “We will work with ICE & the Dallas Police Dept. to get to the bottom of the assassin's motive.”

During the news conference on Wednesday, Eric Johnson, the mayor of Dallas, urged residents to “be patient, remain calm, and let our law enforcement partners, and our police department, do their job”.

Evacuation orders have now been lifted on fast-growing blaze near Paia, recalling Lahaina's deadly 2023 fire

Officials on the Hawaiian island of Maui went door to door evacuating residents from a wildfire on Tuesday and sounded emergency sirens. But evacuation orders were lifted later in the day as the threat from the fire receded.

The fire, which on Tuesday grew to more than 100 acres (40 hectares), was first reported at 1.30pm near the north shore town of Paia, officials said.

Paia is a former sugar plantation town that has become popular with windsurfers. It is on the other side of the island from Lahaina, which was destroyed by a deadly wildfire in 2023.

“Leave immediately!” said one alert from Maui's emergency management agency. “There is a dangerous threat to life and property.”

Firefighters worked throughout Tuesday afternoon and evening to stop the blaze's forward progress, and emergency shelters closed late on Tuesday as residents returned home.

Before the situation improved, residents were fearful of another devastating blaze. Nohelani Uʻu-Hodgins, a Maui county councilwoman, said her family, including her 86-year-old grandmother, had to evacuate from Paia to stay with her.

“It's terrifying,” she said. “We never have to learn the lessons of Lahaina twice; that's never something we need to learn once again. But from my house I'm watching my home town burn.”

Paia resident Rod Antone said he was working in a county building in Wailuku where he listened to radio updates but didn't hear the sirens. In the hours before the wildfire engulfed Lahaina in 2023, Maui county officials failed to activate emergency sirens.

Antone noted that winds didn't feel particularly strong on Tuesday, unlike in August 2023, when wind-whipped flames burned Lahaina and left 102 people dead. But like Lahaina, Paia is surrounded by dry brush, he said.

Russia's parliament passed a bill in the first reading on Sept. 24 that would introduce year-round conscription, replacing spring and fall draft cycles, pro-government outlet Kommersant reported.

While conscripts are officially barred from being deployed abroad, reports indicate that many are pressured into signing contracts with Russia's Defense Ministry and sent to fight in Ukraine.

The bill would overhaul the existing system by allowing enlistment offices to conduct medical exams, psychological screenings, and draft board sessions throughout the year. 

Under the proposed system, draft notices would be issued year-round.

The reform is meant to ease pressure on military commissariats, according to Andrei Kartapolov, chairman of the parliament's Defense Committee and the bill's author. 

Russia drafts young men twice a year for one year of compulsory service. 

Russian President Vladimir Putin's partial mobilization in 2022, the first since World War II, triggered protests across Russia and a mass exodus of more than 261,000 men. 

Although the Kremlin declared mobilization "completed," it has never been officially ended by a decree.

Since then, Moscow has sought to avoid another large-scale mobilization by ramping up contract recruitment, offering financial incentives to volunteers.

After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor.

Igor Krasnov, ex-prosecutor general known for his pivotal role in the Kremlin's crackdown on dissent, was the sole candidate for the role.



One of the largest oil refineries in Russia, the Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat petrochemical plant in the Republic of Bashkortostan, came under Ukrainian attack overnight on Sept. 24.

The cyberattack disrupted automated check-in systems caused flight cancellations and delays at several major European airports.



 The Kyiv Independent's deputy chief editor, Oleksiy Sorokin, sits down with British historian Niall Ferguson on the sidelines of the Yalta European Strategy (YES) conference to discuss the geopolitical realities shaping Russia's war against Ukraine.  



Despite security precautions, a direct hit against a shelter made it impossible to fully prevent casualties, according to the military.

While conscripts are officially barred from being deployed abroad, reports indicate that many are pressured into signing contracts with Russia's Defense Ministry and sent to fight in Ukraine.

The A330 aircraft was traveling to Lithuania's Siauliai air base, reportedly also carrying relatives of Spanish air force personnel deployed as part of a NATO air policing mission.

The Caspian Pipeline Consortium confirmed that its office in the city was damaged. 

"I don't know the cost of such actions, but it is clear that it was too high," said Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine's former commander-in-chief.

A Russian unit broke into a house and killed the girl's parents before abducting her, Ukraine's 3rd Army Corps reported on Sept. 24.

Responding to Trump's comment that Russia looks like a "paper tiger," Kremlin spokesperson Peskov said that "Russia is more commonly associated with a bear. There is no such thing as a 'paper bear,' and Russia is a real bear."

The tax increase, part of the draft budget submitted to the Russian government, is aimed "primarily at funding defense and security needs," the Russian Finance Ministry said.

Construction continues at the Lithium Nevada Corp. mine site Tracker Pass project on April 24, 2023, near Orovada, NevRick Bowmer/The Associated Press

U.S.-listed shares of Lithium Americas (LAC-N, LAC-T) jumped over 100 per cent on Wednesday after Reuters reported that the Trump administration is seeking up to a 10 per cent stake in the miner, in the latest sign of Washington's intervention into industries it considers critical to national security.

Late Tuesday, Reuters cited two people familiar with the talks who said the administration is considering the stake as part of negotiations over a US$2.26-billion Department of Energy loan for the company's Thacker Pass lithium project in Nevada, the largest planned lithium mine in the Western Hemisphere.

Vancouver-based Lithium Americas said on Wednesday it was in discussions with the U.S. energy department and General Motors over the Thacker Pass loan.

The move underscores President Donald Trump's increasing use of direct government ownership to steer strategic sectors and curb reliance on China, which dominates refining of many critical minerals.

China produces over 40,000 metric tons of lithium annually, ranking third after Australia and Chile, but dominates refining, processing more than 75 per cent of the world's lithium into battery-grade material.

TD Cowen analysts said a government stake would lend credence to the Thacker Pass project completion and expansion to multiple phases with perhaps enhanced economics.

The project is seen as a linchpin in building a domestic supply chain part of Washington's long-standing drive to boost U.S. production of lithium, a metal used to make batteries for electric vehicles and other electronics.

The Trump administration recently moved to take a stake in chipmaker Intel following a deal that would make the Department of Defense the largest shareholder in rare earths MP Materials. Jefferies said the administration's preference for equity stakes, viewed as lower political cost than tax increases, can support financing, corporate profits, and favorable returns on invested capital.

Lithium Americas' Canadian and U.S.-listed shares were both up about 90 per cent at $8.04 and US$5.80, respectively. The company had a market value of US$744.5-million as of last close on the New York Stock Exchange.

GM, which invested US$625-million in the mine last year for a 38 per cent stake, has the right to buy all of the project's lithium from its first phase and a portion from the second phase for 20 years, although Trump officials are now seeking a guarantee that GM will buy the metal, according to the sources.

NBCFM Research analyst Mohamed Sidibe said the MP Materials-DoD model shows how government equity, long-term offtake, and price support can derisk strategic projects.

He added for Lithium Americas, a similar approach could strengthen funding and project durability, though it may dilute existing shareholders.

The Thacker Pass project is expected to begin production in 2028.

Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein said an equity stake could include offtake price guarantees, potentially making Thacker Pass profitable even if lithium prices remain lower for longer.

The news also lifted other lithium miners in premarket trading. Albemarle gained 5.5 per cent while Sigma Lithium climbed 9 per cent. U.S.-listed shares of SQM rose 3.3 per cent.

Joshua Jahn killed two detainees and severely injured another before taking his own life, NBC News reports, as DHS says another detainee in critical condition

Full report – Three people shot at Texas Ice building

The shooter who killed two detainees, and severely injured another, before taking his own life, has been identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, according to NBC News – who cited several senior law enforcement officials.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) noted, in their statement on today's shooting, that this isn't the first time the Dallas field office was targeted this year.

In August, Bratton Dean Wilkinson, 36, arrived at facility's entrance and claimed to have a bomb in his backpack. Officials said that Wilkinson showed the security officer what he claimed to be a “detonator” on his wrist. 

A shelter-in-place was issued for the field office, and Dallas police responded with a bomb squad. Wilkinson was later charged with making terroristic threats, per DHS.

The state superintendent in Oklahoma announced plans to put Turning Point USA chapters in every high school in the state, saying it would counter “radical leftist teachers' unions” and their “woke indoctrination”.

After far-right activist Charlie Kirk was killed on a college campus earlier this month, requests to start chapters of his conservative youth group, Turning Point, at colleges and high schools have surged, the organization has said.

Oklahoma is the first state where the government is getting involved to promote starting these chapters. In a press release Tuesday, Ryan Walters, the Oklahoma superintendent, detailed how students could start a chapter of “Club America”, the organization's high school program, by gathering at least three students from the same school and completing a charter agreement. Then, Turning Point will help the club get a teacher sponsor and official recognition, and send materials like an “activism kit”.

“We will be putting TPUSA on every high school campus in Oklahoma,” Walter said in the press release. “Charlie Kirk inspired a generation to love America, to speak boldly, and to never shy away from debate. Our kids must get involved and active. We will fight back against the liberal propaganda, pushed by the radical left, and the teachers unions. Our fight starts now.”

Two detainees have been killed, with another in critical condition, after a shooting at an Ice field office near downtown Dallas. Dallas police chief Daniel Comeaux says that the FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence. The shooter died from a “self-inflicted gun wound”, according to DHS secretary Kristi Noem.

DHS say that no members of law enforcement were hurt in the attack. But Comeaux also said that officials would not releasing the identities of any victims at this time.

DHS officials say this was “an attack on ICE law enforcement”. At both today's press conference and in a statement, law enforcement said that shell casings found near the shooter had “anti-Ice” messaging on them.

Earlier, Dallas police said that shots were fired “from an adjacent building”. DHS, later added that the shooter “fired indiscriminately” at the Ice facility, “including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot”.

Despite the fact that no federal agents were wounded in the shooting, Governor Greg Abbott of Texas called the attack an “assassination”. For her part, Noem said that “these horrendous killings must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences.”

The 12-ft bronze statue depicting Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein holding hands and prancing together that was erected on the National Mall early on Tuesday has been taken down.

The statue appeared courtesy of a group of anonymous artists that goes by The Secret Handshake, who said they received a permit from the National Park Service that allowed the statue to stay up until 8pm on 28 September.

A member of the group told the Guardian that despite this, it was removed in the early hours of Wednesday. They do not know the statue's whereabouts. “This is a literal example of the Trump administration toppling free speech when it has been legally permitted and approved,” they said.

A spokesperson for United States Park Police told the Washingtonian that the force assisted the National Park Service in removing the statue Wednesday at 5:30am, “due to it not being in compliance with the permit”.

Despite receiving some serious flack recently for his premature social media updates on the Charlie Kirk shooting investigation which turned out to be wrong, FBI director Kash Patel has been quick to post on X the few details we've just heard from that *brief* press conference.

Patel simply confirms that one person was killed in the attack [two if we include the shooter], several wounded, the shooter took his own life, and no law enforcement personnel were hurt. He posted a photo of five shell casings, one of which is engraved with the phrase “anti Ice” in blue ink, which he said belonged to the gunman and “shows an idealogical [sic] motive behind this attack”.

Patel did not mention in his post that among the victims were Ice detainees, neither did officials at that press conference.

A reminder that the investigation is ongoing and a motivation for the shooting hasn't yet been established.

Texas senator Ted Cruz says “politically motivated violence is wrong” and needs to stop, referring to the killing of Charlie Kirk.

Comeaux confirms that no members of law enforcement were hurt in the attack. Four people were shot and two people are dead.

Notably, Comeaux says they're not releasing the identities of any victims at this time.

DHS earlier confirmed that detainees were “among the victims”.

Comeaux says that early evidence suggests rounds found near the shooter contained messages that were “anti-Ice in nature”.

Dallas police chief Daniel Comeaux says that the FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence.

Dallas mayor Eric Johnson is speaking now.

He asks for prayers for the city and the country.

Texas governor Greg Abbott has posted the following on X:

Texas fully supports ICE. Both the Texas Dept. of Public Safety & Texas National Guard work closely with ICE. This assassination will NOT slow our arrest, detention, & deportation of illegal immigrants. We will work with ICE & the Dallas Police Dept. to get to the bottom of the assassin's motive. We will offer ICE additional support to assist their operations.

Abbott, and vice-president JD Vance, have been quick to frame the shooting as an attack on Ice, even though the DHS has already confirmed that no federal agents were wounded and the only confirmed victims have been detainees.

We'll learn more of the facts in the press conference due to begin shortly.

Law enforcement officials will brief the media shortly following the shooting at an Ice field office in Dallas.

At least one person was pronounced dead at the scene, and two are wounded. A DHS official said that detainees were among the victims and that no federal agents were wounded.

Dan Bongino, deputy director of the FBI, said that his office is “fully engaged” with local law enforcement in Dallas following today's shooting.

Cameco shares have more than doubled in the last year.Liam Richards/The Canadian Press

When Prime Minister Mark Carney met with Donald Trump in the White House in early May, the U.S. President rambled off a list of products, including cars and steel, that he said the United States did not need from Canada. Uranium was not on that list. 

There is a good reason for the Trump administration to keep the door open to Canadian uranium. America's nuclear power supply chain is currently vulnerable, with about 25 per cent of the country's enriched uranium being sourced from Russia. That reality likely prompted U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright to champion the expansion of America's uranium stockpiles as he was attending the International Atomic Energy Agency general conference in Vienna on Sept. 15 The news sparked renewed interest in uranium stocks which have already been in a bull market.

Cameco CCO-T shares have more than doubled over the past 12 months, and insiders at the uranium mining giant have been in profit-taking mode. As of Sept. 19, 14 Cameco insiders have sold just over $12.7-million worth of stock into the public market over the past six months. The 130,787 shares were sold at an average price of $97.34. During the same period, four insiders acquired a total of 91,325 shares through the exercise of options at strike prices ranging from $11.32 to $15.27.

Such insider profit-taking is not unusual given the stock's rally, particularly given its pricey valuations. Last week, the stock had a trailing 12-month P/E ratio above 90. Weighed down by insider sales and high valuations, Cameco sits in the bottom 30 per cent of our INK Edge rankings based on valuations, insider buying and holdings, and price momentum. That said, Cameco does rank high in terms of price momentum, and it is conceivable that the stock could continue to rise despite insider profit-taking and its price tag. In our experience, insider selling in large companies can often take place months and even years before a stock enters a meaningful correction.

Uranium miner Cameco lowers 2025 production forecast amid McArthur River mine transition delays

In terms of actionable signals, we generally tend to favour insider buying over selling. On that front, two smaller names have hit our screens recently. Mega Uranium MGA-T is an investment and junior exploration company which is currently in the top 10 per cent of our rankings with a sunny INK Edge outlook. It caught our attention as a potential value play. Over the past six months, five insiders acquired just over 1.6 million shares, primarily through options. As of June 30, Mega Uranium's investment portfolio had a fair value of $202-million while the stock's current market cap is about $145-million. 

As of midyear, the investment portfolio included 19,476,265 NexGen Energy NXE-T shares and 1,033,736 IsoEnergy ISO-T shares. As of Friday, NexGen shares are up year-to-date by 28 per cent and IsoEnergy is up 25.2 per cent, but Mega Uranium has risen only 16.6 per cent. If bullish uranium sentiment picks up more steam in the months ahead, junior names like Mega Uranium, which have lagged some larger names, could conceivably benefit from increased investor flows. Under such a scenario, the stock's discount to net asset value could shrink as the stock plays catch-up. 

The Canadian market is also in the fortuitous position of having exposure to mining names with operations in different parts of the world, including the United States. Anfield Energy AEC-X is focused on its Shootaring Canyon Mill and the Velvet-Wood and Slick Rock uranium and vanadium projects. Shootaring Canyon is one of three licensed, permitted, and constructed conventional uranium mills in the U.S. The mill and Velvet-Wood are in Utah while Slick Rock is nearby in Colorado. On May 13, Velvet-Wood became the first uranium project fast-tracked under Mr. Trump's energy emergency declaration.

On May 27, the U.S. Department of the Interior completed its environmental permitting for the project. We often hear Mr, Carney talk about Canada building projects at speeds never imagined. The speed up of the Anfield approval shows the type of competition Canada is facing.

Despite the headlines, Anfield stock has failed to surpass its 52-week high of $10.13 set last October. Chief operating officer Daniel Bleak appears to see opportunity. On July 31, the company consolidated its shares on a 75 to 1 basis as it pursued a U.S. listing. Over the past three months, he has bought 7,750 at an average price of $7.95 on a post-consolidation basis. He now holds 267,006 shares representing about 1.7 per cent of all shares outstanding.

			Agency's former employees have until Oct 6 to accept or decline offer to return to work after cost-cutting drive

Hundreds of US government employees who lost their jobs in Elon Musk's cost-cutting drive are being asked to return to work.

The General Services Administration (GSA) – which manages government workspaces – has given its former employees until the end of the week to accept or decline reinstatement, according to an internal memo obtained by the Associated Press.

Those who accept must report for duty on Oct 6 after what amounts to a seven-month paid leave.

Mr Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) identified the GSA, which had about 12,000 employees at the start of the Trump administration, as a chief target of its campaign to reduce fraud, waste and abuse in the federal government.

Starting in March, thousands of GSA employees left the agency in programs that encouraged them to resign or take early retirement.

A small cohort of Mr Musk's trusted aides stayed in the GSA's headquarters, sometimes sleeping in cots on the agency's sixth floor, and pursued plans to cancel nearly half of the 7,500 leases in the federal portfolio.

Doge also wanted the GSA to sell hundreds of federally owned buildings with the goal of generating billions in savings, publishing a list of hundreds of government buildings that were targeted for sale.

The GSA sent more than 800 lease cancellation notices to landlords, in many cases without informing the tenants.

Pushback against the GSA's dumping of its portfolio was swift, and both initiatives had been scaled back. More than 480 leases put forward for termination by Doge have since been spared.

The leases were for offices scattered around the country that are occupied by such agencies as the Internal Revenue Service, Social Security Administration and Food and Drug Administration.

Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official, said: “Ultimately, the outcome was the agency was left broken and understaffed.

“They didn't have the people they needed to carry out basic functions.”

Mr Becker, who represents owners with government leases at Arco Real Estate Solutions, said GSA had been in a “triage mode” for months.

He said the sudden reversal of the downsizing reflected how Mr Musk and Doge had gone too far, too fast.

Doge's “wall of receipts,” which once boasted that the lease cancellations alone would save nearly $460m, has since reduced that estimate to $140m by the end of July, according to Mr Becker.

As part of its cost-cutting drive, the GSA cut the GSA's headquarters staff by 79 per cent, its portfolio managers by 65 per cent and facilities managers by 35 per cent, according to a federal official.

The official, who was not authorised to speak to the media, provided the statistics on condition of anonymity.

Because of the internal turmoil, 131 leases expired without the government actually vacating the properties, the official said.

The situation has exposed the agencies to steep fees because property owners have not been able to rent out those spaces to other tenants.

David Marroni, a senior official at the Government Accountability Office, said the congressional watchdog is examining the GSA's management of its workforce, lease terminations and planned building disposals, and expects to issue findings in the coming months.

A death binder is an instruction manual for a person's life that includes everything from a copy of a will, powers of attorney, financial documents, letter of wishes, funeral arrangements, household information and all forms of identification.oonal/iStockPhoto / Getty Images

After watching friends and family go through the laborious process of managing an estate, more executors are insisting on completed death binders before agreeing to take on the role, say experts in the death planning industry.

“I hear this all the time from executors, … ‘Unless you do the preparation, I will not be your executor,'” says Rosemary Pahl, Calgary-based author of The Departing Details Workbook.

A death binder is an instruction manual for a person's life that includes everything from a copy of the will, powers of attorney, financial documents, letter of wishes, funeral arrangements, household information and all forms of identification. Most clients start working on their death binders after drafting their wills and powers of attorney, experts say. 

As a former intensive care registered nurse, Ms. Pahl witnessed family turmoil firsthand with patients placed in palliative care and their surviving family members struggling with options and finding key documentation.

“They have to make decisions and they don't know what the person wanted,” she says. 

 Ms. Pahl then realized her own family didn't have great clarity on final arrangements either. After retiring, she made it her mission to clean up the family's financial affairs and create a binder. The process took her three years as she kept thinking of more issues to address. She marvelled at how much time it took her to find her own required documents and get professional advice on funeral arrangements, her finances, and to discuss her wishes with her family. 

“Then, I imagined [what if] that was my executor or children trying to find things when I had difficulty myself,” says Ms. Pahl, whose personal death binder project spurred the start of her company. Through word of mouth and a business partnership with an e-commerce entrepreneur, she has sold more than 10,000 of the Departing Details binders worldwide to date. 

More people are using death binders as a way to keep track of the more diverse set of assets people have today, says Tim Hewson, founder and chief executive officer of LegalWills in Toronto.

“If we think about our parents, they had a house, a bank account with a monthly statement sent by mail,” he says. “We have online accounts, revenue from a blog, photos, crypto [and] rewards points. The expectation that an executor could come in and make sense of all of this is inconceivable.”

Mr. Hewson says younger generations are turning to online death binders, where information can be updated more easily. With paper-only copies, many are left to wonder if they're reading the most up-to-date information.

His company's death binder, called LifeLocker, is a service offered to those who draft a will through LegalWills. He says LifeLocker is encrypted in the cloud. The client creates a digital keyholder (executor) who can access the information upon the client's passing.

“Then, we have safeguards to make sure the keyholder doesn't access it prematurely or someone who isn't your keyholder doesn't access it,” he says. 

One issue with some online death binders is whether the company will even be around when the person dies, Mr. Hewson says.

“You need to know the company is going to be there when you die,” he says. “So, there has to be ongoing engagement or a subscription keeping people involved in the service.”

He says that with LifeLocker, clients receive annual reminders to verify and update their information.

Christa Ovenell, a licensed funeral director and death doula at Death's Apprentice Education and Planning in Vancouver, says the process of getting affairs in order is daunting for many. Buying a binder is one thing, doing the work is another, she notes. 

“It's hard work that's easy to avoid,” she says, and sometimes online binders exacerbate that feeling of reluctance. 

For example, Ms. Ovenell finds that seniors tend to be distrustful of keeping sensitive data in the cloud, often commenting that it's only useful if folks know how to access it.

While online makes it easier to make changes on the fly, Ms. Pahl finds most clients download the PDF, save it in their documents, but still print out the information to place in a physical binder with all the other documents. 

“Some things are just not fill-in-the-blanks. Some things are producing your birth certificate and putting it in the binder,” Ms. Pahl says, adding that she keeps those documents in plastic sleeves and stores the binder in a home safe. 

Once the binder is completed, the final step is ensuring the executor knows where to find and how to access it. 

“This is an act of love and kindness for your family,” Ms. Pahl says. “You don't want to be remembered as someone who left everything in chaos.”

“Jimmy Kimmel Live” returned to ABC's late-night television on Sept. 23, after being suspended for six-days over controversial remarks the host made on air about the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.

The late-night show was suspended after Kimmel said in his monologue that “many in MAGA land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk” and that “the MAGA gang” was “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.” MAGA stands for President Donald Trump's “Make America Great Again” policy agenda.

UN, September 24. /TASS/. Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov has called for an immediate end to the genocide of the Palestinian people and urged recognition of Palestine's independence during the session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

"We demand an immediate halt to the genocide against the Palestinians and the launch of an international judicial investigation by the UN International Court of Justice," Japarov declared. In his view, the global community must not remain indifferent to the human tragedy unfolding "before the eyes of the entire world."

He stressed that Kyrgyzstan firmly condemns violence and terrorism in all forms, including the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. "Such terrorists must be punished severely. However, there are established methods and procedures for combating terrorism and eliminating terrorists. These are the methods that should be employed," he explained.

Japarov went on to insist that the recognition of Palestinian independence is essential. "The only path to a lasting peace is the realization of the two-state principle. Palestine must achieve independence based on the 1967 borders," he said.

The Kyrgyz leader also voiced opposition to missile strikes on Qatar and Iran. "We likewise condemn the recent rocket attacks on the territories of Qatar and Iran, as such actions are an infringement on the sovereignty of independent states, pose a threat to regional stability and security, and violate the norms of international law," Japarov emphasized.

MINNEAPOLIS—A 12-year-old girl shot in the head during the deadly attack at a Catholic church in Minneapolis less than a month ago is making “miraculous” progress, her family said in a statement.

Sophia Forchas, who was the most seriously wounded child among those who survived the shooting at the Church of the Annunciation, will move this week from acute care to an inpatient rehabilitation program, her family said.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

DON GRAVES, JR., was U.S. Deputy Secretary of Commerce from 2021 to 2025.

AROOP MUKHARJI was Senior Adviser for Economic and National Security to the Deputy Secretary at the U.S. Department of Commerce from 2022 to 2024. The views expressed here are his own.

 How Profit Seeking Distorts American Policymaking

 Don Graves, Jr., and Aroop Mukharji

Until recently, few policy tools united Democrats and Republicans like export controls. Restrictions on the spread of dual-use U.S. technology such as semiconductors became the policy of choice in the tech race against China and as a means of punishing Russia for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In the wrong hands, semiconductors and certain other U.S. technologies can present national security risks. Politicians might have debated the details, but there was broad bipartisan agreement that the U.S. government should regulate the movement of these technologies.

The Trump administration has also embraced the use of export controls—but it has added a twist. In August, the administration brokered a revenue-sharing deal with Nvidia, a U.S. company that designs semiconductor chips used to power artificial intelligence. In exchange for export control licenses to sell its H20 chip to China, the company will now give 15 percent of its revenue from those sales to the U.S. government. Previously, the U.S. government reviewed license applications to ensure transactions did not present unacceptable risks. This time, the administration replaced that process with a price tag, prioritizing side payments to the government over security interests.

Although Beijing banned Chinese companies from buying Nvidia's chips last week, after accusing the company of violating antimonopoly laws, the Trump administration's deal is part of a worrying trend: the monetization of national security. Instead of treating security as an indivisible, priceless ideal—similar to free and fair elections, free speech, or freedom of religion—the administration is treating U.S. national security as if it were a portfolio of divisible, priceable assets. What once was security is now securities. Worse, the prices appear to be negotiable: the president revealed in a press conference that the administration had sought a 20 percent cut of Nvidia's sales but settled for 15.

Reducing national security to dollars and cents does not just distort the term's meaning; it also makes the United States less secure. Replacing licenses with revenue-sharing deals, making certain types of direct investments, and squeezing U.S. allies and partners may all help fill U.S. government coffers. But policies designed to maximize short-term gain can create new security problems and leave the old ones unsolved. They will enable U.S. technology to more easily reach American adversaries, cost the U.S. government oversight over taxpayer money, and sacrifice Washington's ability to shape the world around it.

Avoiding these dangers and reducing the U.S. economy's exposure to risk requires a careful, farsighted strategy that recognizes the reality of the United States' place in today's world. True economic security will remain out of reach as long as the government is run as a business, its policy levers and relationships priced, bundled, and repriced, available to be bought and sold.

Economic concerns were fundamental to national security when the term was first introduced in national debate, about a century ago. As the historians Peter Roady and Andrew Preston have recently documented, during his 1932 election campaign and following presidential term, Franklin Roosevelt deliberately defined the phrase to capture risks to domestic economic well-being. In his second fireside chat in 1933, Roosevelt argued that economic struggle led to “incalculable” social harm and a “loss of that sense of security.” A new domestic economic program was “imperative to our national security,” he declared, later summarizing, “Freedom from fear is eternally linked with freedom from want.”

Roosevelt's original interpretation of national security later gave way to a more militarized, more expansive conception, reinforced by the interests of a growing arms industry and the rise of the modern military-industrial complex. It came to encompass every corner of the world. This focus on military and ideological competition reigned supreme into the early years of the twenty-first century, even as Washington began paying greater attention to the financial tools it could use to contain threats from terrorist groups and rogue states after the 9/11 attacks.

In the 2010s and early 2020s, Roosevelt's vision of the economic and domestic dimensions of national security made a bipartisan comeback. The second line of the Obama administration's 2015 National Security Strategy affirmed that “America's growing economic strength is the foundation of our national security.” In his first term, Trump championed the same idea. “For the first time,” he remarked on releasing his 2017 National Security Strategy, “American strategy recognizes that economic security is national security.”



Four years later, President Joe Biden's 2021 interim national security guidance repeated the same mantra: “Economic security is national security.” Biden's Department of Commerce played a greater role in national security policy than anyone in government could remember, not just with export controls but also in work on supply chains, cybersecurity, information and communication technology, climate change, investment security, law enforcement, commercial diplomacy, standards development, patents, domestic investment, and even commercial space policy. There was substantial bipartisan alignment on many of these issues. Republicans were especially supportive of the department's export control policies, and in late 2023, Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis proposed establishing a federal office of economic security and competition—with a mandate similar to that of new offices the Biden administration had created earlier that year, including the Commerce Department's Supply Chain Center and the Office of Economic Security and Emerging Technology, part of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

It is not simply that economic, technology, and trade policy became more appealing arrows in the national security quiver. That did happen. But more significantly, on a philosophical level, leading Democrats and Republicans agreed that security itself meant much more than an absence of physical attack. It also meant reducing economic struggle and risk. They saw economic security as a domestic issue as much as an international one. The erosion of strategic U.S. industries and the loss of technological leadership, for instance, could leave the United States vulnerable to foreign actors who might weaponize trade dependencies. The supply chain disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic showed just how easily the country could lose access to critical goods. The first Trump administration's relentless focus on manufacturing domestically to rely less on others and its concern that Huawei and TikTok could give the Chinese government access to American data, furthermore, continued into the Biden administration. With notable exceptions, such as export controls, Democratic and Republican policy solutions were not always the same, but everyone largely agreed on what the problem was.

The second Trump administration is challenging this consensus. Traditionally, national security has been about reducing threats; now, the administration seeks to profit from them, ostensibly in the eventual hope of cutting taxes for the public benefit. The H20 chip deal with Nvidia is one way it has done this, by allowing a company whose business with China presents a national security threat to buy off that risk. Trump has said that H20 chips are “obsolete” products that China “already has,” suggesting that selling them presents no risk to the United States. The point is moot in this case if Beijing keeps a ban on Nvidia's chips in place. But in principle, a riskless export control license is an oxymoron; licenses are required only when the government has identified a risk. It did so for the H20 chip just a few months ago, in April. This is the reason paying for export control licenses is prohibited under U.S. law (Title 50 of the U.S. Code), to prevent a situation in which financial gain takes precedence over national security concerns. When export controls are about money rather than security standards, U.S. technology will easily reach malign actors.

Possible legal complications, however, have not stopped the Trump administration from pursuing this kind of arrangement. It has already reached a deal with another technology company, AMD, to give the U.S. government 15 percent of its revenue from selling its MI308 processors in China—something Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (whose department does not oversee dual-use export controls) called a “beta test.”

The administration could continue to replicate this model, and not just in export control cases. It could, for example, try to generate cash for the federal government by accepting payment in exchange for the approval of foreign direct investment in U.S. companies, wiping away potential national security concerns for the right price. If an investment presents any kind of concern, such as data security, however, pretending the problem does not exist because someone has agreed to pay the government is not a real solution. And left unresolved, a national security problem will only fester.

The monetization of national security has not been limited to revenue-sharing deals. The administration is also exploring direct investment in U.S. companies. Most notably, the government announced in August that it was purchasing a ten percent stake (roughly $8.9 billion) in Intel, the United States' largest semiconductor manufacturer. Unlike revenue-sharing deals, direct investment is unusual but not unprecedented. There can be legitimate reasons for the government to invest in a company that is critical to national security and needs help. For instance, a struggling company that faces closure or a foreign takeover might need both cash and strategic guidance. Or a startup that is not yet generating revenue may need public investment when private capital is not an option. But making money should not be the primary goal—a single company's payouts to the government should not be prioritized above nationwide security interests.



The Intel deal illustrates this risk. Federal money was already promised to Intel through grants from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act; this money came with protections attached to ensure it was used to advance the public interest. The largest grant supported manufacturing projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon, and the company was obligated to report on project milestones and follow national security guardrails that, among other things, limited its activities with foreign countries of concern. Also embedded in the grant program was a provision to return money to taxpayers in the case of unanticipated profits, called “upside sharing.”

But instead of continuing to disburse grant money and keeping these protections in place, the U.S. government opted for equity. This meant more cash up front for Intel and potentially more future revenue for the federal government but—critically—a significant loss of oversight of taxpayer dollars. Intel may decide to use those dollars in ways that support national security interests. Or it may not.

Finally, the administration has monetized national security through its approach to U.S. military support and foreign aid, helping others if it brings a financial return. “Taiwan should pay us for defense,” the then candidate Trump said in 2024. “You know, we're no different than an insurance company.” Shortly after Trump's election, Taiwan pledged to increase its spending on U.S. weapons; in the early months of his presidency, Trump's frequent complaints about allied free-riding pressured others to do the same. The administration followed a similar mercenary logic in pursuing a critical minerals deal with Ukraine in exchange for Washington's continued support for Kyiv's war effort and in canceling U.S. foreign aid across the globe. To replace a “charity-based model” of development assistance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote in July, the administration would instead seek investment opportunities that produce “a multiplier effect” that benefits the private sector.

Yet likening aid to an insurance policy or a market venture misses the greatest strategic value of supporting others. Take development aid. Aside from the compelling morality of alleviating human suffering, this aid can provide a bulwark against foreign manipulation, the emergence of terrorist havens, the growth of black markets, and other security threats that arise from chronic underdevelopment and economic struggle. Those interests, like so many others—nuclear nonproliferation, maintaining robust alliances, supporting democracy—have little to do with immediate financial returns.

To call the Trump administration's approach to national security transactionalism misses the bigger point. Transactionalism assumes an exchange, tit for tat. But the administration instead is trading an intangible for a tangible: security interests for cold, hard cash. In doing so, it betrays a fundamentally different view of what national security is—one that suggests security can be priced at all.

At best, the administration's pursuit of profit distracts Washington from solving national security concerns; at worst, it deepens those threats. Monetization can even create new vulnerabilities and sources of insecurity by incentivizing affluent players to join the game. Take, for instance, Qatar's gift of a gleaming $400 million airplane to transport the U.S. president. In the administration's eagerness to accept a golden egg, it has created a golden espionage opportunity by inviting foreign surveillance.

The core problem with monetizing national security interests is that it contradicts the basic principles of economic security. This subset of national security includes protecting the U.S. economy, critical infrastructure, and American well-being; building national resilience to disruptions; and generally ensuring the safe and stable flourishing of American society. Truly advancing economic security requires that policymakers navigate tradeoffs, recognize that other countries hold leverage, engage partners, and play the long game.

Maintaining a bird's-eye view of tradeoffs and tensions in economic security policy is essential to making wise decisions. Economic actions taken on behalf of national security, such as export controls, could have the unintended effect of limiting economic growth and innovation. Likewise, some actions taken in the pursuit of economic growth and innovation, such as export promotion and scientific collaboration, may undermine national security if those exports and research products are used to threaten Americans. The pitfall to avoid is creating new sources of insecurity or areas of misunderstanding. An action to resolve one risk should not create an even greater risk. For instance, the Trump administration's early approach to tariffs—massive, punitive, and blunt—roiled the market and created economic uncertainty that even the president could not stomach. More narrowly targeted trade arrangements would help minimize adverse effects on American consumers, producers, and investors. They would also ensure the clarity, transparency, and predictability that CEOs and U.S. allies and partners crave.



Successful economic security policies also appreciate balance-of-power politics. The United States does not exist in a unipolar world, controlling supply chains and economic chokepoints. The more it acts as if it does, such as through coercive tariffs, the more other countries will balance against it. Frustrations with U.S. tariff policies have already breathed new life into the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, an economic and security body that encompasses more than 40 percent of the world's population and aspires to be a strategic counterweight to the United States' presence in Asia. More balancing may follow suit.

A smarter approach would engage partners. This is not just about doing good; it is strategic. Building trusted supply chains, protecting data, and executing export controls, for instance, all rely on coordination with international partners and, perhaps more important, with industry. Without coordination, rules are weaker, evasion is easier, and law enforcement is harder. True cooperation is not a slipshod, made-for-TV deal. It is accomplished through regular, deliberative bureaucratic conversations and adherence to process. By genuinely seeking input from its partners, the United States can avoid the kind of harmful backlash to its policies that ultimately undermines U.S. influence.

Finally, policymakers must recognize that economic security is a long game. Economic tools such as export promotion to build trusted supply chains tend to take years to work. Yet many national security professionals mistakenly assume that they will see the same immediate results as decisive military action. This rarely happens; it is always easier to destroy than it is to build. Economic policy has the most to offer over the long term, in its potential to transform societies. This is what makes development aid—which the Trump administration has slashed as a supposed cost-saving measure—so valuable. Development, of course, cannot happen overnight. And it is not always clear what problem, or malign actor, the aid is warding off. But helping build a healthier and more prosperous world reduces the chances of many bad outcomes.

The United States' security challenges are becoming only more complex, and policymakers are still figuring out how best to address them using the economic tools at their disposal. Yet one guiding principle is clear: a democratic government does not exist to enrich itself.National security policy, therefore, should not seek profits or involve opportunistic bonus payments. The U.S. government's national security responsibility is to ensure national security. That is it.

Adelita Grijalva, the daughter of the late U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), has won a special election to the U.S. House of Representatives from Arizona's Seventh District, which was recently held by her father.

Grijalva defeated the Republican nominee, Daniel Butierez, with 70.6 percent of the vote to his 27.6  percent. As of writing, she had garnered 58,046 votes in total. The race was called by The Associated Press at 11:08 p.m. ET.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has arrived in New York to attend the ongoing U.N. General Assembly, Russian state media reported early on Sept. 24.

World leaders, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, arrived for the week-long annual U.N. summit on Sept. 22. Russian President Vladimir Putin is not in attendance.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to meet Lavrov on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly on Sept. 24, according to Rubio's schedule for the day.

The U.S. has intensified efforts to broker a peace deal to end Russia's war against Ukraine in recent months, with no success. U.S. President Donald Trump met Putin in Alaska on Aug. 15, but has since voiced discontent with the Russian leader for failing to cooperate in efforts to end the war.

Lavrov's flight to New York from Moscow took nearly 12 hours as the aircraft avoided flying over other countries before arriving in the U.S., Russian state media claimed.

Ukraine's allies have barred Russian aircraft from using their airspace. Canada and EU member states have banned Russian planes from flying over their own territory in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Moscow first announced on Sept. 19 that Lavrov is set to meet Rubio on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, with no date set at the time.

Zelensky and Trump met on the sidelines of the global summit on Sept. 23.

The U.S. leader has previously called for Ukraine to make concessions to Russia, but following his meeting with Zelensky, he signaled that Ukraine may be able to return all of its territory as Moscow refuses to cease hostilities.

"After getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia Military and Economic situation and, after seeing the Economic trouble it is causing Russia, I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform afterward.

The same day, Zelensky told reporters that Trump now trusts Kyiv more following dishonesty from Putin.

"Gradually, (Trump) realized that Putin was simply sharing some information that was far from the truth on the battlefield. Now he trusts me much more because the information that my intelligence has, that we share with our partners," Zelensky said at a press conference.

﻿A conservative explains what Kirk meant to the MAGA movement — and how it's reacting to his death.

It is impossible, I think, to grasp the terrible consequences of Charlie Kirk's death without understanding who he was in life.

Liberals had a dim view of that track record — focusing on his often-offensive radio broadcasts and contributions to Trump's authoritarian project (like sending seven buses to the January 6 protest). However, to conservatives, he was something very different: not just an effective political organizer but a living symbol of democratic politics done the right way.

I must admit that this second perspective doesn't come naturally to me. But I wanted to understand it better, so I reached out to Tanner Greer — a conservative author and essayist who had written brilliantly about what Kirk meant to the right on his blog The Scholar's Stage.

In his piece, Greer argues that Kirk was “the indispensable man” on the populist right: Nobody else had his genius for organization or his extensive connections with nearly everyone of note in the MAGA movement. On an ideological level, per Greer, Kirk represented a vision of politics in which the populist right competes on the left's turf, from universities to elections, and wins in direct political combat. In this, he stood against MAGA's most radical anti-democratic voices.

The ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.

So when he was killed, Greer explains, his many friends and allies saw it as proof that the broader left was now incapable of coexisting with even someone as genial and small-d democratic as Kirk — giving rise to the vehement, even authoritarian, response of people like Stephen Miller and JD Vance. Now, much of the right believes it's their turn to seize control of culture, to have a version of the left's “George Floyd moment” of 2020.

I didn't agree with much of the thinking Greer described. But I found his explanation of it, to borrow a phrase, “indispensable.”

He helped me understand why leading Republicans blame an ill-defined “they” for Kirk's killing, rather than a shooter who seemingly acted alone, and just how emotional these conservatives must be in the wake of Kirk's passing. If we are to keep sharing a country, you need to understand this perspective — perhaps especially if you disagree with it.

What follows is a transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.

Tell me what you think most people who only knew Kirk from his radio broadcasts missed about him.

Second only to Donald Trump himself, Kirk is probably the most important individual in creating the current intellectual and organizational landscape of the MAGA movement. You wouldn't get any of this at all if all you knew of him was some guy who's willing to say shocking things on the internet.

In the piece, I suggest there's [several] aspects of Charlie Kirk that made him a very powerful individual.

First, the size of his audience. His radio show had about 500,000 people who listened to it. His TikTok channel had 7 million followers. He's had campus debates that had upwards of 2 billion views in total all across the world. 5 million Twitter followers on top of that. So he had this giant megaphone. If he wanted to come out and publicly take a position, Republicans would listen.

The second thing that he had was TPUSA and the little organizations that were built off of it. TPUSA is a very large, 850- to 900-chapter organization. This is a mass mobilization machine. This is a mass talent-building machine, as future political leaders often come from people who were TPUSA chapter leaders in their universities. And then on top of that, he builds these other outreach organizations. He has a giant outreach organization for evangelical church leaders.

Then he has a vote-getting machine that is very active in swing states in the 2024 election — most Republicans seem to think that TPUSA's Turning Point Action Committee might've gotten 10 to 20,000 votes in Arizona, which is basically the margin of a [close] election. They had perfected the strategy of basically primarying people for not being MAGA enough in Arizona, which is TPSUA's organizational home, and they were going to go state to state to state in the near future.

Your third source of power is that he's this connector.

Donors love him. He's famously charismatic. Because he himself had kind of raised up this whole generation of new activists, he knew who was the best potential staffers or the best potential state House candidates or congressional candidates. There are several congressional candidates who came from TPUSA and are in Congress right now. And because he was running this podcast where he's talking to the existing class of staffers, the existing media magnates, the existing politicians, he's at the center of this network of people. And this is probably one of his most important roles in the right, especially the more MAGA right. He was constantly working to get people from one part or one of these constituencies to meet them with somebody else.

You wrote, “There are a good four dozen people in the Trump administration who owe their appointments to an introduction Kirk made on their behalf. And this was not only true of the Trump administration, but also across Congress and state governments and in news agencies like Fox News.“

It's a guesstimate. The number might be underestimated — because Kirk was involved in a very personal way in vetting for this administration's appointments.

You have to understand the right has a problem: We have a much smaller talent pool than the left. And if you are restricting it even further, if you need to restrict your talent pool to people who are more MAGA — people [who] can pass a Laura Loomer test — then you have an even smaller number of potential people. And so Kirk basically spends all the months of November and December and January, every day, meeting with [then-White House personnel director] Sergio Gor, talking about, “Here's somebody who might be good for this position, here's somebody who shouldn't be in that position.” And he wasn't the only one doing that, but he was a big part of getting people in the door and keeping some people out.

But this isn't just true for little [roles]. This is true for Cabinet members. JD Vance is there because of Charlie Kirk.

During 2024, Charlie Kirk took a three-month break from TPUSA to basically be Don Jr.‘s manager. And Kirk sends a text to Don and says [something like], “I know that this guy [Vance] said these things about how Trump was Hitler back in the time, but he's had a conversion. He's one of us now. You need to meet with him. You need to take him seriously. You need to introduce him to your dad.”

That's how JD Vance got in with cahoots with Trump in the first place, just because of Charlie Kirk. If you listen to the Charlie Kirk radio show that JD Vance hosted, he mentions this story. And almost every single person they had from the administration come on has a very similar story. There's half a dozen Cabinet-level or people just below that who can say, “Kirk advocated for me to have this position, and that helped tip the balance.”

You can hear that not just in what they said, but the way in which they said it, in the obvious pathos and emotionality that came across in the discussions of Kirk during that radio broadcast or during the funeral on Sunday night. They all say that they genuinely cared for Kirk. 

Part of me thinks, “Well, everybody on the right wants to have been close to him now.” But listening to you talk and listening to some of the stories people tell, I think this is just actually true: that he really did mean a lot to a lot of the people that are in power right now. And so part of this vehement political reaction to Kirk's death is born out of this deep emotional and personal connection with him.

I think that's correct. If you look at the MAGA movement as a whole, Kirk was a lot of people's friend. That's why all these donors are able to give him so much money. He was very good at being very optimistic and being like, “We're going to win, we can do this,” cheering people up.

This position at the center of the MAGA world network — in addition to these kind of institutional things that he built up, the big megaphone he had, his ability to basically leverage all of that into helping other people make connections — made him sort of an indispensable pillar of the movement.

So when he was shot, that was really not just an attack on somebody who says very controversial things. This is a person who helped pioneer [not only] the message, but also the institutions and the organizational networks of the current version of the right. And he did it by the time he was 31. An immensely talented individual.

One thing that's also struck me in the responses and the way that these figures talk about Kirk's death is the omnipresence of the word “they. It's “they” killed Charlie, “they” took Charlie from us, even though there's no evidence that the shooter was in any kind of conspiracy. 

So what do people on the right mean by “they?”

When George Floyd died in 2020, there was not a sense that this was the action of a single policeman, and if we put him in jail, then the problem's over. There was rather a sense that you could only have a person like this policeman, who's willing to stand on the neck of a Black man he's just arrested until he dies — this could only happen if you have a larger systemic problem in America.

I think many, many people on the right want to have their own version of the 2020 moment, partially because their analysis is very structurally similar to how leftists thought about racism in 2020. They think there's larger structural problems — that [the shooter] only can exist because of a larger culture that supports his conduct, excuses it, and allows it to happen.

All these people went through 2020 and they want to have a similar reckoning, because that was experienced by the right as a very harrowing event — where essentially every single institution in the United States, every university, every provost, most corporations all gave out statements talking about how what happened was an act of evil and we need to nationally atone for the sin. If you didn't agree with that stuff, this felt very oppressive to you, like you were being chased out of the public sphere.

And I think this is the easiest way to make sense of why some people on the right feel very strongly that we need to do things like, say, take Jimmy Kimmel off the air.

They remember 2020, and they feel like if Jimmy Kimmel had gone against Black Lives Matter, he would've been taken off the air without the state. And we don't have that same activist network [as the left], but we do have the state. And so we should try to create the same sort of structural cultural change that was imposed upon us in the Great Awokening.

Help me understand that comparison a little bit more. In the George Floyd scenario, it's pretty easy to see what the structural roots of Derek Chauvin's actions are — a policing sector, and a society more broadly, shot through with racism. 

But in the Kirk case, what's the equivalent force that created Kirk's killer? Is it left-wing animosity toward conservatism? Is it mainstream liberal ideology? What is the thing that the violence against Kirk is supposed to be an outgrowth of? Who specifically are “they” that embody whatever the structure is?

This “they” will differ from person to person. I don't think there's a consensus. The possible options for “they” range from, at the narrowest, the kind of antifa people who are willing to use or at least endorse violence on the left. [At the broadest], it's all the way to a [liberal] culture that sees Trump as inherently illegitimate and un-American and [as someone who] should be deplatformed.

Just to give you an example: Somebody was making a big deal out of a tweet that Vice President Harris had written in 2019, saying how basically, if we're being honest with ourselves, Trump should be kicked off Twitter by now because of his bad comments. That was cited as an example of the left's inherent desire to kick us out of public spaces. Very similar to when Hillary Clinton says, “[Half of] Trump supporters are a basket of deplorables.”

If you're dehumanizing us, if you're calling us deplorable, you're basically saying we're outside of the pale of American politics — then you are part of the “they” who basically dehumanizes someone like Kirk enough that he should be killed. I think that's how they would say it.

I'm not trying to weigh in with my own opinions on this. I just want to understand better what is this “they”? Because to me, it seems analytically incoherent. JD Vance, for example, has brought up the Open Society Foundation, which in no plausible world had anything to do with Charlie Kirk's death. But it was one of Vance's political enemies.

Many actors on the right have for many years believed — and I have a lot of sympathies with this set of beliefs — that a lot of what the left has been about for the last decade, since the Great Awokening started, is basically making it difficult for conservatives to be part of the public sphere in a safe and confident way.

And that word “safe” is interesting because when you start talking about safety, you can start roping in several different streams, which I don't think liberals would necessarily associate with each other, into one system. This allows you to say, okay, people being deplatformed on campuses, that's one version of us not being able to participate publicly. All the way to the riots in 2020, which a lot of conservatives felt Democratic cities and the sitting government allowed — which made it impossible for a person like me to be in these urban spaces for X amount of time. They made these cities too dangerous for us to be in.

And that's where people will do this kind of mining, where, okay, Soros funded this Black Lives Matter-adjacent organization, which was making excuses for rioters here. That's where they'll kind of all connect that together.

Someone like you, you'll look at that and say, “Well, what does that have to do with Charlie Kirk being assassinated by this [lone wolf]?” And I think a lot of people on the right will say, “No, no, no, this is a large systemic thing. All you guys excused the violence in 2020, excused antifa, excused taking over CHAZ, excused all this stuff because you normatively agreed with it and thought that Trump was bad enough that that this sort of violence was okay. And that's the same attitude, that's the same world that creates young guys who want to go and shoot one of our most prominent leaders.”

I think that's how they would connect those dots.

Now, how does that attitude relate to something you talk about in the article at length, which is Kirk's role in giving young conservatives permission to be themselves publicly in places like a university?

This question of what he meant to the young conservatives is quite relevant to this larger question: What is the “they”?

The way I explain it in this piece — this is really hard for liberals to believe — is that, if you were a young conservative on campus from 2013 to 2022, you felt afraid. Even when Trump was in power, a lot of these conservatives felt afraid. And this fear is really core to a lot of what has happened, I mean, really in this administration as well as people's reactions to Kirk's death.

If you were a young person on the right — you believe something like transgenderism is a lie or a mental disease, which is a pretty standard belief on the right — you were afraid to say what you believed because you felt like you would be socially ostracized, people on campus would bully you, harass you, treat you differently, you would have professors who might grade you differently, you wouldn't have good job prospects, you would be afraid of becoming a viral example.

This is the environment in which TPUSA begins its giant rise. And Kirk's campus tours, the sort of thing he was doing when he was shot, this is actually what they're designed to combat. Yes, they created some viral clips, but that really was not their main purpose. Because Kirk was a campus activist first, a media figure second.

The purpose of these was for Kirk to go into these universities and say, “Hey, guys, look, we can be part of the public sphere. There are more of you than it seems. You guys are all afraid to stand up and show you're conservative. I'm going to come here, I'm going to organize a TPUSA chapter, and you're going to see that you're not alone. Second, I'm going to go and debate all these people around you, anyone who wants to come up. A professor, a student, anyone who wants to can come and debate me. And I can show you guys that these beliefs we have are defendable. We can stand up, we can be part of the public sphere.”

And so there's a lot of young conservatives who basically say, “Charlie Kirk made me unafraid to be an activist. Charlie Kirk is the one who made me unafraid to stand up for what I believed.”

Without someone like Charlie, the only people who would stand up for their conservative beliefs tended to be either extremely principled people or they were just assholes who like to be disagreeable. I'm sure you've probably met both of those sorts when you were in college. If you want to have a movement that isn't just people like that, you have to find some way to inspire people to stand up. And that's what Kirk was doing. He's modeling to all these kids, look, you guys can do this too.

And that's who was murdered. And so when the guy whose whole message is “you don't have to be afraid” is shot, then it makes some sense why people might be feeling afraid.

That's where I wanted to bring us to at the end: how both sides should feel about their enemies.

I have this fear, given Kirk's personal significance, that the right's authoritarian reaction to his death is not going to be a short-lived thing — you may disagree. But if Charlie Kirk was trying to create a politics where people who disagree could engage, the aftermath of his death is destroying that possibility. It's making it very, very, very difficult for people across partisan lines to view each other with anything but mistrust and suspicion.

So what are we supposed to do about that?

I think there's a little bit of a crossroads here. I think the right has to decide whether Kirk's life or his death is the thing that should be remembered.

I think that Kirk's life, although many aspects of it are very repellent to people on the left, is an example of how this conservative national populist thing can be done without authoritarian measures and be very popular. I personally am on the side of saying, “Guys, look, Kirk actually showed us the path for how to make this work, and we'd be stupid if we left it for something that we don't know if it will work.”

What I've been telling people on the right is, if you seriously believe you're going to have a 2020 moment, you guys are somewhat deluding yourselves. Because 2020 had very many special things that led up to it.

Obviously, you had a pandemic, everyone was cooped in their house and wanted to get out and be out. But in addition to that, you had years of activism. Black Lives Matter started seven years before 2020. And the New York Times had basically doubled its reporting on racism and racial problems in America in the three years that preceded 2020.

You had a huge amount of intellectual work being done. You had a huge amount of activism being done. And in many ways, 2020 was the culmination of a decade's worth of theorizing and activism and changing public opinion. So I don't think this attempt to use the state to have a 2020 moment is going to work. I just don't think the public is there: I think it's going to backfire.

And I understand, too, that certain people have a bad opinion of Kirk. But I do think that the impulse of some on the left to take this moment to say, “Well, Charlie Kirk was just this terrible person in all these ways, he said this terrible and that terrible thing, and we're being censored if we don't see otherwise” — to put it very frankly, lots of people on the [more radical] right are very happy to see those takes.

The debate the right has been having for a long time is “Do we think that the other side can live with us? How much of a threat really are they to us?” And so when the reaction of some people is to condemn the violence, but then talk about how actually it's good that he's gone, which is more or less what these people do, it sounds more like you are part of this structure of ideas that makes it acceptable for right-wing people to be killed.

A lot of people, a lot of politicians, understand this and have gone out of their way not to be inflammatory on all this. I think clearly this is what [former Vox co-founder and now New York Times columnist] Ezra Klein was thinking when he wrote that editorial. But he got dragged through the mud for that, and he really had to justify himself showing up, talking to people on the right.

Maybe it's helpful if folks on the left don't just discount Kirk as that terrible racist who says all these terrible things. If that's the message you took away from all this, I think you'll really misunderstand both what Kirk meant to the movement, but also what his death means to the movement as well.

Former FBI special agent Nicole Parker discusses the latest details on the deadly shooting at a Dallas ICE facility during ‘The Faulkner Focus.'

Sources familiar with the investigation into the Dallas immigration facility shooting identified Wednesday's alleged attacker as Joshua Jahn, 29.

The gunman killed two detainees and injured another after opening fire on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility from a nearby building before taking his own life, police say. The detainee who survived was hospitalized in critical condition. 

Jahn fired "indiscriminately" at the ICE building, as well as at a van in the sally port where the victims were shot, the Department of Homeland Security said. The three detainees were in an unmarked transport van when they were shot, before Jahn took his own life around 7 a.m., according to the sources. He was found dead with a rifle on a nearby rooftop, authorities said.

A photo posted on X by FBI Director Kash Patel showed what appeared to be rifle-caliber ammunition affixed to a clip. The rounds were engraved with an "anti-ICE" message.

Wednesday's shooting happened only miles from Prarieland, Texas, where just two months ago an individual ambushed a separate ICE facility targeting officers. In total, 16 people have been charged in the ambush-style shooting of an Alvarado police officer who was responding to reports of vandalism at the facility.

"These despicable, politically motivated attacks against law enforcement are not a one-off," Patel wrote. "It has to end, and the FBI and our partners will lead these investigative efforts to ensure that those who target our law enforcement are pursued and brought to the fullest extent of justice," he added.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said Wednesday's attack targeted law enforcement.

"The attack on ICE in Dallas is yet another despicable assault on law and order," he said. "The epidemic of leftist political violence must end. Democrats have fostered an environment of evil, emboldening radicals to kill, steal, and destroy. But we will never surrender."

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said his state supports immigration enforcement officers and that the shooter's actions "will NOT slow our arrest, detention, & deportation of illegal immigrants. We will work with ICE & the Dallas Police Department to get to the bottom of the assassin's motive."

Vice President JD Vance called for an end to "obsessive attacks" on law enforcement, particularly ICE.

"These horrendous killings must serve as a wake-up call to the far left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences," Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X, while chiding elected officials who demonize immigration authorities. 

"Comparing ICE day in and day out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences," she added. "The men and women of ICE are fathers and mothers, sons and daughters. They get up every morning to try and make our communities safer. Like everyone else, they just want to go home to their families at night."

DALLAS (AP) — A shooter with a rifle opened fire from a nearby roof onto a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement location in Dallas on Wednesday, killing two detainees and wounding another before taking his own life, authorities said.

The exact motivation of the attack was not immediately known. The FBI said at a morning news conference that ammunition found at the scene contained anti-ICE messaging. The head of the agency, Kash Patel, released a photo on social media that shows a bullet containing the words “ANTI-ICE” written in what appears to be marker.

“The shooter fired indiscriminately at the ICE building, including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a release.

The detainee who survived was in critical condition at a hospital, DHS said.

Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News that no ICE agents were injured.

“We believe he was shooting at law enforcement and detainees from an apartment building,” McLaughlin said. “Detainees were among the victims of the shooting.”

The FBI said during the news conference that it was investigating the shooting as “an act of targeted violence.”

The attack is the latest public, targeted killing in the U.S. and comes two weeks after conservative leader Charlie Kirk was killed by a rifle-wielding shooter on a roof.

Officers responded to a call to assist an officer on North Stemmons Freeway around 6:40 a.m. Wednesday and determined that someone opened fire at a government building from an adjacent building, Dallas police spokesperson Officer Jonathen E. Maner said in an email.




Edwin Cardona, an immigrant from Venezuela, said he was entering the ICE building with his son for an appointment at around 6:20 a.m. when he heard gunshots.

An agent gathered people who were inside the building, took them to a more secure area and explained that there was an active shooter in the area, Cardona said.

“I was afraid for my family because my family was outside. I felt terrible because I thought something could happen to them. Thank God no,” Cardona said.

Cardona said his family was brought into the building, and they were later reunited.

The ICE facility is along Interstate 35 East, just southwest of Dallas Love Field, a large commercial airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and blocks from hotels catering to airport travelers.




Traffic cameras near the scene showed six lanes of a normally busy freeway empty, with cars and semitrailers ground to a halt on an interstate exit. Dozens of emergency vehicles were seen near the facility.

Shortly after the shooting and before officials said at least one of the victims was a detainee, Vice President JD Vance posted on the social platform X that “the obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.”

U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz from Texas continued in that direction, calling for an end to politically motivated violence.

“To every politician who is using rhetoric demonizing ICE and demonizing CPB: stop,” Cruz told reporters, referencing Customs and Border Protection.

But immediately after the news conference in which officials refused to say whether the victims included detainees, Democratic U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey called in to Dallas' WFAA-TV newscast and told them he was “absolutely sickened” by some officials' comments.

“If they are trying to control this narrative and they don't want migrants to be the victim in this story, then they may want to slow-walk giving us any information about this so they can still keep on talking about attacks on ICE,” Veasey said.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said details were still emerging, but the agency was confirming there were “multiple injuries and fatalities” at the field office. Noem said the motive remained unclear, but noted there has been an uptick in targeting of ICE agents.

A July 4 attack at a Texas immigration detention center injured a police officer, who was shot in the neck. Attackers dressed in black military-style clothing opened fire outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, federal prosecutors said. At least 11 people have been charged in connection with the attack.

A man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents as they were leaving a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen on July 7. The man, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, injured a police officer who responded to the scene before authorities shot and killed him. Police later found other weaponry, ammunition and backpacks inside his car.

WASHINGTON (AP) — When President Donald Trump's administration announced it would repurpose an old, generic drug as a new treatment for autism, it came as a surprise to many experts — including the physician who suggested the idea to the nation's top health officials.

Dr. Richard Frye told The Associated Press that he'd been talking with federal regulators about developing his own customized version of the drug for children with autism, assuming more research would be required.

“So we were kinda surprised that they were just approving it right out of the gate without more studies or anything,” said Frye, an Arizona-based child neurologist who has a book and online education business focused on the experimental treatment.

It's another example of the haphazard rollout of the Trump administration's Monday announcement on autism, which critics say has elevated an unproven drug that needs far more study before being approved as a credible treatment for the complex brain disease.

A spokesperson for the Republican administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday morning.

The nation's leading autism groups and researchers quickly distanced themselves from the decision on leucovorin, a derivative of vitamin B, calling the studies supporting its use “very weak” and ”very small.”

“We have nothing resembling even moderate evidence that leucovorin is an effective treatment for autism symptoms,” said David Mandell, a psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania.




Mandell and other researchers say the evidence suggests autism is mostly rooted in genetics, with input from other factors, including the age of the child's father.

Nevertheless, a growing number of doctors are prescribing the medication, repurposing versions used for chemotherapy or ordering new formulations from compounding pharmacies.

Many researchers agree the drug warrants additional study, particularly for patients with a deficiency of folate, or vitamin B9, in the brain that may play a role in autism. But for now, they say, it should only be taken in carefully controlled clinical trials.

“We often say our job is to stay between the yellow lines,” said Dr. Lawrence Gray, a pediatric developmental specialist at Northwestern University. “When people just decide to go outside of current guidelines, then they're outside of that. And nobody knows what's going to happen out there.”

The case for leucovorin's use in autism begins with established science but quickly veers into uncertain terrain.

When metabolized, the drug turns into folate, which is essential for healthy prenatal development and is recommended before and during pregnancy. But far less is known about its role after birth.

The issue caught the attention of Frye and others more than 20 years ago, when research suggested some people with autism had low levels of folate in the brain due to antibodies blocking the vitamin's absorption.

The theory linking autism to folate levels was mostly abandoned, however, after research showed that the siblings of people with autism can also have low folates without any symptoms of the condition.

“I honestly thought this had died out as a theory for autism and was shocked to see its reemergence,” Mandell said.

In 2018, Frye and his colleagues published a study of 48 children in which those taking leucovorin performed better on several language measures than those taking a placebo.

Four small studies in other countries, including China and Iran, showed similar results, albeit using different doses, metrics and statistical analyses, which researchers say is problematic.

Frye struggled to get funding to continue within the traditional academic system.

“I decided to move out of academia to be more innovative and actually do some of this stuff,” he said. 

Earlier this year, Frye and several other researchers formed a new entity, the Autism Discovery Coalition, to pitch their work to Trump administration officials including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

“After Kennedy got in, we thought they'd hopefully be friendly to autism scientists,” he said.

An August meeting with National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya quickly led to further discussions with the Food and Drug Administration about testing a proprietary, purified version of leucovorin.

A new formulation of the decades-old drug would mean new patents, allowing Frye and his yet-to-formed drug company to charge far more than the cheap generics currently on the market.

“We have a lot of investors who are excited about leucovorin and want to do something high quality for kids with autism,” he said.

But the FDA's announcement Monday may have scuttled that plan. Instead of previewing a new version, the agency said it would simply update the label on the generic drug to mention use in boosting folate brain levels, including for patients with autism. That's expected to encourage more doctors to prescribe it and insurers to cover it.

Specialists who have spent decades treating autistic patients say it's important to proceed carefully and methodically.

Gray recalls other experimental treatments that initially looked promising only to fail in larger studies.

“Small studies often find populations that are very motivated,” Gray said. “But when those therapies are moved into larger studies, the initial positive findings often disappear.”

Among the challenges facing leucovorin: There isn't agreement about what portion of autism patients have the folate-blocking antibodies supposedly targeted by the drug.

Frye screens his patients for the antibodies using a test developed at a laboratory at the State University of New York. Like many specialty tests, it has not been reviewed by the FDA.

Gray says the only way to definitively test for the antibodies would be by extracting cranial fluid from children with autism through a spinal tap.

“That's a big limiting factor in having these large, randomized controlled trials,” Gray said.

While the Trump administration discusses fast-tracking leucovorin, interest in the drug continues to swirl online, including in forums and social media groups for parents of children with autism.

Brian Noonan, of Phoenix, found out about the drug earlier this year after asking ChatGPT for the best autism drug options for his 4-year-old son.

The FDA has never approved any drug for the underlying causes of autism, but the chatbot directed Noonan to Frye's research.

After an evaluation and confirmatory blood test, the boy started on a formulation of the drug from a compounding pharmacy in June.

Within days, Noonan says, he saw improvement in his son's ability to make eye contact and form sentences.

“He's not cured, but these are just areas of improvement,” Noonan said. “It's been a big thing for us.”

Iran has begun rebuilding missile-production sites targeted by Israel during its 12-day war in June, satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press show, but a key component is likely still missing — the large mixers needed to produce solid fuel for the weapons.

WHY THIS MATTERS: Reconstituting the missile program is crucial for Iran, which believes another round of war with Israel may happen. The missiles are one of Iran's few military deterrents after the 12-day war with Israel in June decimated its air defense systems.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran has begun rebuilding missile-production sites targeted by Israel during its 12-day war in June, satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press show, but a key component is likely still missing — the large mixers needed to produce solid fuel for the weapons.

Reconstituting the missile program is crucial for the Islamic Republic, which believes another round of war with Israel may happen. The missiles are one of Iran's few military deterrents after the war decimated its air defense systems — something that Tehran long has insisted will never be included in negotiations with the West.

Missile experts told AP that obtaining the mixers is a goal for Tehran, particularly as it prepares for possible United Nations sanctions to be reimposed on the country later this month. The sanctions would penalize any development of the missile program, among other measures. In an address to the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian blamed the Israeli attacks and the separate U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites for “dealing a grievous blow” to peace negotiations.

Known as planetary mixers, the machines feature blades that revolve around a central point, like orbiting planets, and offer better mixing action than other types of equipment. Iran could purchase them from China, where experts and U.S. officials say they've purchased missile fuel ingredients and other components in the past.

“If they're able to reacquire some key things like planetary mixers, then that infrastructure is still there and ready to get rolling again,” said Sam Lair, a research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies who studied Iranian missile sites.

Iran's mission to the United Nations did not respond to questions about the country's efforts to rebuild its missile program.

Solid-fuel missiles can be fired faster than those using liquid fuel, which must be loaded just before launch. That speed can make the difference between launching a missile and having it destroyed in a launcher — something that happened during the war with Israel.

Iran has solid-fuel missile manufacturing bases at Khojir and Parchin, two sites just outside Tehran, as well as at Shahroud, some 350 kilometers (215 miles) northeast of the capital. Even before the most recent war, all of those sites came under Israeli attack in October 2024 during hostilities between the countries.






Attacks during the war in June appeared aimed at destroying buildings that housed the mixers, which are needed to ensure the missile fuel is evenly combined, according to experts. Other sites struck by Israel included manufacturing facilities that likely could be used to make the mixers.

Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC taken this month and analyzed by AP show construction at both the Parchin and Shahroud facilities.

At Parchin, mixing buildings appear to be under repair, Lair said, and similar rebuilding is happening at Shahroud involving mixing buildings and other structures.




The speed at which Iran is rebuilding shows the importance Tehran puts on its missile program. Iran's bombed nuclear sites so far have not seen the same level of activity.

During the war, Iran fired 574 ballistic missiles at Israel, according to the Washington-based Jewish Institute for National Security of America, which has a close relationship with the Israeli military. In two exchanges of fire before the war, Iran launched another 330 missiles, the think tank said.

The Israeli military had estimated Iran's total arsenal at around 2,500 missiles, meaning that over a third of its missiles were fired.

Before the war, Iran was on track to be able to produce more than 200 solid-fuel missiles a month, said Carl Parkin, a summer fellow at the James Martin Center. That drew Israeli strikes to missile-building facilities.

“Israel's targeting indicates that they believed mixing was a bottleneck in Iran's missile production,” he said. “If Iran is able to overcome their mixing limitations, they'll have all the casting capacity that they need to start producing at high volumes again.”

The Israeli military declined to respond to questions over its strategy. Iran's defense minister, Gen. Aziz Nasirzadeh, recently claimed Tehran now has new missiles with more advanced warheads.

“The 12-day war with Israel has altered some of our priorities,” he said on Aug. 22. “We are now focused on producing military equipment with higher precision and greater operational capabilities.”

Iran may choose to rely on China to obtain mixers and the chemicals to make solid fuel.

Such chemicals may have caused a massive explosion in April that killed at least 70 people at a port in Iran. Iran still has not explained the blast, which happened as its diplomats met with Americans in Oman over its nuclear program.

Just days after the explosion, the U.S. State Department sanctioned Chinese firms it said provided the Islamic Republic with “ballistic missile propellant ingredients.”

Meanwhile, Iran's Revolutionary Guard likely supplied a planetary mixer to an underground ballistic missile construction facility in Syria near the town of Masyaf, some 170 kilometers (105 miles) north of the capital, Damascus, near the Lebanese border. Footage released by the Israeli military months after the September 2024 raid on the facility showed the mixer, which bore a resemblance to others sold online by Chinese firms.

Iran's president and military officials visited Beijing earlier this month for China's Victory Day parade. Iran's government has provided no detailed readout on what Pezeshkian said to Chinese President Xi Jinping, and China's state-run media offered no indications that Tehran asked for help.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry, asked about possibly supplying Tehran mixers and fuel ingredients, told AP that Beijing is “willing to continue leveraging its influence to contribute to peace and stability in the Middle East.”

“China supports Iran in safeguarding its national sovereignty, security and national dignity,” the ministry said. “At the same time, China is deeply concerned about the continued escalation of tensions in the Middle East.”

Can Kasapoğlu, a senior fellow with the Washington-based Hudson Institute, said Beijing could supply guidance systems and microprocessors as well for Iran's ballistic missiles.

“If Iran uses its relationship with China to bolster its disruptive military capabilities, the 12-day war could be a mere speed bump for the Iranian regime, rather than a decisive defeat,” he wrote.

Lair, the analyst, said if Iran restarts its production at prewar levels, the sheer number of missiles produced will make it harder for the Israelis to preemptively destroy them or shoot them down.

“They are clearly very invested in their missile program, and I don't think that they're going to negotiate it away, ever,” he said.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries held a press conference in response to President Donald Trump canceling a planned meeting with congressional Democrat leaders to discuss government funding before the Sept. 30 shutdown deadline.

FIRST ON FOX: A Senate Republican wants to know the exact cost of a partial government shutdown as GOP and Democratic leaders are at an impasse to keep the government open.

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, called on the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to provide a detailed report on the sprawling impact that a partial government shutdown could have, including payments throughout the federal government and the possible broader economic impact.

The House GOP passed its short-term funding extension, known as a continuing resolution (CR), last week, but the bill was later blocked by Senate Democrats. For now, Republicans and Democrats in the upper chamber are at odds on a plan to keep the government open.

And the deadline to fund the government by Sept. 30 is fast approaching.

Ernst, who chairs the Senate DOGE Caucus named after tech-billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, laid the fault of a potential shutdown on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in her letter to CBO Director Phillip Swagel.

"The same politicians who whined and complained about the Department of Government Efficiency laying off unnecessary bureaucrats just a few months ago are now forcing a government-wide shutdown themselves to expose who is and isn't an essential employee," she wrote.

Ernst requested a sweeping economic operational impact analysis from the agency, including how a shutdown could affect back pay costs for furloughed non-essential employees, military pay, congressional pay and the broader economic impact that the government closing could have on the private sector.

TRUMP CANCELS MEETING WITH SCHUMER, JEFFRIES OVER 'RIDICULOUS DEMANDS' AS FUNDING DEADLINE LOOMS

Specifically, she wanted to know how businesses could be impacted by a temporary stoppage of government services, like loans, permits and certifications, and how companies and businesses could recoup losses after a shutdown ended.

She also wanted information on lost efficiencies in the government and the costs that could accrue from unfulfilled procurements or allowing contracts to lapse, and whether the burden of keeping national parks open would fall onto the states or if they'd be shuttered, too.

The CBO did provide an analysis of the cost of the last time the government shuttered in 2019, when Schumer and President Donald Trump were at odds on providing funding to construct a wall at the southern border. That 35-day shutdown was the longest in U.S. history, and no funding for a border wall was granted.

The report, published in January 2019, found that the shutdown saw roughly $18 billion in federal spending delayed, which led to a dip in that year's first quarter gross domestic product of $8 billion. The report noted roughly $3 billion of that would not be recovered.

THUNE SLAMS DEMOCRATS' 'COLD-BLOODED PARTISAN' TACTICS AS FUNDING DEADLINE NEARS

It also found that federal workers who received delayed payments and private businesses were the hardest hit.

"Some of those private-sector entities will never recoup that lost income," the report stated.

It remains unclear whether Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Schumer can strike a deal. After Trump canceled a planned meeting Tuesday with Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., both Democrats blamed the president for the looming shutdown.

However, Democrats' asking price for a short-term funding extension is too high for Republicans.

They want permanent extensions to Affordable Care Act subsidies, a full repeal of the "big, beautiful bill's" health care title, which includes the $50 billion rural hospital fund, and a clawback of the canceled funding for NPR and PBS.

"Once again, Donald Trump has shown the American people he is not up to the job," Schumer said. "It's a very simple job: sit down and negotiate with the Democratic leaders and come to an agreement, but he just ain't up to it. He runs away before the negotiations even begin."

The president's plans for Memphis resemble the aggressive, showy, and ultimately failed crime-fighting strategy once used by the city's police.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

When President Donald Trump describes his plans to deploy the National Guard to Memphis as a “replica” of what he's done with federal troops in Washington, D.C., he's attempting to make two points: first, that it's appropriate for him to deploy the military in American cities at all, and second, that doing so effectively reduces crime in cities that just happen to be run and disproportionately populated by his perceived political foes. But the vision he has laid out to “make Memphis safe again” is familiar in another key way: It looks a lot like the crime-fighting strategy the city tried just a few years ago—one that ultimately failed.

The president signed an executive memorandum on September 15 directing federal agents to combat street crime in Memphis through “hypervigilant policing,” “aggressive prosecutions,” and “strict enforcement of applicable quality-of-life, nuisance, and public-safety laws.” The memo called for “large-scale saturation of besieged neighborhoods” and highlighted issues such as graffiti, noise, public intoxication, and traffic violations as areas of focus for federal agents set to descend on the city.

All of this sounds remarkably similar to what Memphis tried previously—an effort that, according to the Department of Justice, had disastrous results. “We have reasonable cause to believe that MPD and the City engage in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the Constitution and federal law,” DOJ investigators wrote in a December 2024 report on the Memphis Police Department's activities, sharply rebuking a policing style that managed to antagonize local residents while doing little to solve or prevent violent crime. “First, MPD uses excessive force. Second, MPD makes unlawful stops, searches, and arrests. Third, MPD unlawfully discriminates against Black people when enforcing the law.”

In response to that report—which found that crime had worsened despite the city's constitutionally questionable crackdown—Memphis leaders said they had already intervened to stop the most egregious abuses. But with the support of Tennessee's Republican state leaders, Trump now appears eager to return to the “saturation-style enforcement” that the Justice Department said was effective at arresting thousands of Memphians for traffic violations and nonviolent offenses but abysmal at catching the gang members and other criminals driving the city's high violent-crime rate.

From the July/August 2008 issue: American murder mystery

As Trump redirects his anti-crime crusade to Republican-run states—St. Louis and New Orleans have been floated as targets for future troop deployments—the president is finding little resistance from their governors. This removes a significant obstacle that had complicated his plans to send Guardsmen into Chicago and Baltimore. But Memphis, like other blue cities in conservative states, is a fraught target for other reasons. Although Trump's threats to send Guardsmen into states with a Democratic governor tend to spark unified opposition from state and local leaders, his recent pivot has exposed tensions between state and local officials over race, local control, gun laws, and tax dollars.

JB Smiley Jr., a member of the Memphis City Council, told me he feared that Trump's federal surge would disproportionately target Black residents and undocumented immigrants for petty violations, while doing little to solve serious crimes and address gun violence. “If your goal is to send troops there hoping something goes wrong so that you can send in a more aggressive military occupation, then I think this is what you do,” he said.

Most of the people I spoke with in Memphis acknowledged that the city does have a serious crime problem. Although violence has decreased significantly this year—overall crime is at a 25-year low, police said this month—Memphis ended 2024 with the highest rate of violent crime in the nation, according to FBI data. In recent years, homicides have regularly topped 300 a year in the city of about 630,000—a murder rate that the White House recently noted was four times higher than that of Mexico City. When I asked officials in Memphis why the city's crime rate had remained so high, several pointed to a 2021 state law allowing for permitless open carry of firearms, saying that it has exacerbated gun violence. In November, Memphis residents voted heavily in favor of a referendum opposing permitless gun ownership, although the superseding state law has blocked the city ordinance from going into effect. More than 90 percent of recent murders in the city involved a firearm. Trump's memo on “Restoring Law and Order in Memphis,” however, does not mention gun violence.

Bill Lee, Tennessee's Republican governor, has already begun dispatching dozens of state troopers into Memphis ahead of the expected arrival of federal troops. Lee, who went to the White House last week to personally thank Trump for the troop deployment, said he hoped the effort would result in “sustained crime lowering.” But Lee and the National Guard are still sorting out the details, which has delayed what had been expected to be an imminent deployment. It could be weeks before troops are in Memphis, a Pentagon official speaking on the condition of anonymity told The Atlantic. Among the challenges are federal budgetary concerns due to the end of the fiscal year and a possible government shutdown, the official said.

In the meantime, the state troopers have focused on traffic stops, issuing hundreds of tickets in recent days, local officials told me. The push is reminiscent of a strategy Memphians have become accustomed to—and, in many cases, annoyed with—even as their city has become more violent. Over a five-year period ending in 2023, officers in Memphis issued three times as many tickets as did their counterparts in the more populous city of Nashville, making 800,000 traffic stops and issuing 300,000 tickets, according to the Department of Justice. During that same period, murders in the city increased from 186 to 348 annually.

The strategy resembles one of the tactics federal agents have employed in Washington, D.C., during the surge that began last month. Police checkpoints were set up to stop people for traffic infractions, and officers tended to use the stops as an opportunity to check drivers' immigration status or search for outstanding warrants. White House officials credit the highly visible efforts with bringing down rates of carjackings and other crimes, although criminal-justice experts have suggested that such decreases are likely to be short-lived. “There's certainly literature out there that says increased police presence, in terms of the volume of law-enforcement officers, can reduce crime—but sometimes it doesn't,” Nancy La Vigne, the dean of the Rutgers Newark School of Criminal Justice, told me. “And even if it works in the short run, it can do so much damage to community trust that it's going to hurt in the long run.”

Trust between Memphis residents and law enforcement is already strained, said La Vigne, who led the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice during the Biden administration. She cited the 2023 police killing of Tyre Nichols, who was beaten by several Memphis police officers after a traffic stop. Video footage of Nichols crying for his mother while being punched, kicked, and hit with a baton led to nationwide protests and ultimately forced MPD to disband a street-crime unit that had been known for escalatory practices.

The killing of Nichols, by members of that unit, also drew the attention of the Justice Department. Investigators launched a 17-month investigation of the Memphis police, which culminated in the aforementioned report. It found that Memphis officers would violently retaliate against people who mouthed off at them, punch and kick suspects who were already handcuffed, and engage in stop-and-frisk searches without probable cause. Black Memphians such as Nichols, the department found, were disproportionately targeted for abuse. In May, Trump's DOJ closed its investigation into MPD and retracted the report's findings. The five officers involved in Nichols's death, who are also Black, have each either pleaded guilty or been convicted of various federal and state charges related to the killing. A Tennessee jury acquitted three of the officers on additional charges, including second-degree murder, in May.

Trump has regularly complained that departmental guidelines and constitutional restrictions force police officers to be less “tough” than the criminals they are pursuing. Speaking to New York City cops in 2017, Trump urged them to “please don't be too nice” when making arrests. In recent days, he has repeatedly complained about police officers who stand still and accept a verbal onslaught from protesters yelling in their face. “I say when they spit, you hit,” Trump said at the White House last week, describing his advice to federal officials set to deploy to Tennessee. “You can do whatever you want. You do whatever the hell you want.”

In a statement, the White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson pointed out Memphis's elevated crime rates and asserted that Trump's efforts would reduce them. “Following the President's highly successful operation to combat violent crime in DC, which objectively drove down crime rates across the board, numerous Tennessee officials have applauded the President's decision to address crime in Memphis next,” she wrote. “Just as we did in DC, the Administration will work closely with local law enforcement to ensure the success and sustainability of the operation. Addressing crime will benefit all who live in and visit Memphis.”

The Memphis Police Department and Lee's office did not respond to requests for comment. Trump's push to send what he has called “rough-looking” federal troops into cities such as Memphis raises complex questions of race and class, Russell Wigginton, the president of the Memphis-based National Civil Rights Museum, told me. The museum, located at the site where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, has been a gathering point when the majority-Black city has faced racial tension, he said. “For people of a certain age in Memphis, the connotation of the National Guard is traumatic—because they go straight back to imagery of Dr. King on that balcony in front of room 306,” he said, noting that thousands of Guardsmen deployed to the city before and after King's murder, in 1968.

Memphis's mayor, its police chief, and most of the city's officers are Black. The group of leaders Trump assembled last week at the White House to announce the “Memphis Safe Task Force” and discuss the city's future—Lee, Senators Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, and a cadre of Cabinet officials—were almost exclusively white. Several Memphians I spoke with flagged the dynamic as troubling. Wigginton called it “jarring.”

City leaders have said they would welcome federal help to combat violent crime, particularly to address Memphis's low clearance rates for the most serious offenses. Memphis police arrested a suspect in only 28 percent of murders in 2022 and 14 percent of murders in 2023, well below the national rate of 50 percent, according to FBI data. The clearance rates for nonfatal shootings have been even lower. Given the seriousness of the crime problem, Trump's memo highlighting “public intoxication” and “unpermitted disturbances and demonstrations” has led to a fair share of eye rolling among local officials, Tami Sawyer, the general-sessions court clerk for Shelby County, which includes Memphis, told me. “They're going to come arrest people for vagrancy and loitering and noise and graffiti, but they're not going to take the guns out of circulation,” said Sawyer, who oversees much of the operation for the misdemeanor court cases and the jail in downtown Memphis.

She said that the jail is already overcrowded and the air-conditioning in one of the buildings went out earlier this month, leaving those inside to broil during 90-degree days. “We're lucky that we haven't had a riot yet,” she told me.

The Trump administration has done little to coordinate with local officials. Whereas Trump had the power to seize control of the D.C. police department and could rely on federal prosecutors to embrace his approach to charging crimes, the president's authority is more limited outside the nation's capital. A spokesperson for Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy, who would be responsible for deciding whether to charge many of the people swept up in any crackdown, told me last week that he was still waiting to receive a briefing from the Trump administration.

Memphis Mayor Paul Young said he learned of Trump's decision to deploy troops when the president made the announcement on Fox News. Young has said he opposes the idea. Several officials have pointed out that the Trump administration abruptly cut a $1.7 million grant for a local nonprofit focused on violence prevention, and will likely spend many times that amount on the troop deployment.

Meanwhile, residents told me that they have little choice but to wait and see whether the presence of soldiers once again marching through their city will deter crime or only further inflame tensions.

“Memphis has its problems just like any other city—but we're not just this dystopia of foolishness and violence and crime,” Justin Brooks, who handles student recruitment for Christian Brothers University in Memphis, told me. “I hope that while the Guard is stationed here, that it actually benefits us. That's the biggest thing. We fought enough about Is it going to happen? Now it's going to happen, and it's like, What now?”

Along Estonia's border with Russia, authorities are preparing for a potential conflict between NATO and Russia by extending a new border fence and building anti-tank ditches and bunkers. But those defenses won't stop the immediate threat the alliance faces from drones and electronic warfare. (AP video shot by Hendrik Osula, Production by Lorna Petty)

VINSKI, Estonia (AP) — Estonia is extending a fence along its border with Russia and building anti-tank ditches and bunkers in preparation for a potential conflict with Moscow. But those defenses won't guard against the threat that Estonia and its NATO allies face from Russian drones and electronic warfare.

From the Baltics to the Black Sea, countries bordering Russia, Belarus and Ukraine are facing the spillover from Moscow's war in Ukraine.

The incursion of about 20 Russian drones into Poland this month shone a spotlight on holes in NATO's air defenses, as multimillion-dollar jets had to be scrambled to respond to drones that cost thousands and that ended up crashing into the Polish countryside. Russia denied that it targeted Poland, but Polish officials suggested that it was intentional.

Faced with a growing problem, some European Union defense ministers will meet Friday to discuss creating a “drone wall.”

NATO warned Russia on Tuesday that it would defend against any further breaches of its airspace, after Estonia said that Russian fighter jets violated it last week. But although the alliance knows how to identify threats from jets and missiles, dealing with drones is a greater challenge, officials said. 

In Poland, “most of the drones were not detected,” Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said. “This is a real gap we have to solve.”

Military and defense officials from the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — NATO and EU members that border Russia — told The Associated Press that defending against drones requires solving a complex set of technological, financial and bureaucratic problems.




Europe needs cheaper technology to buy and to speed up slow production and procurement cycles, they said. But even then, drone technology is advancing so quickly that anything bought now could be outdated in months. 

“What I need,” said Lt. General Andrus Merilo, who commands Estonia's military, is technology that is “good enough, it's affordable and can be produced in mass.”

“I don't need high-end capabilities of which I can fire only one, against targets which will be attacking in hundreds,” he said.

Russia is using drones every night in Ukraine, because each drone is a “lottery ticket that always wins,” said Kusti Salm, a former top official at Estonia's Defense Ministry.

That's because a drone either hits something or, if Ukraine shoots it down with a missile, it drains Kyiv's air defenses and finances, since missiles are more expensive than drones, said Salm who now runs Frankenburg Technologies, a company developing low-cost anti-drone missiles.

Although NATO countries have a “very good understanding” of how to defend against conventional threats such as missiles and planes, they need to rapidly improve at dealing with drone threats, said Tomas Godliauskas, Lithuania's vice-minister of national defense.

When the Russian drones flew into Poland, NATO nations deployed fighter jets and attack helicopters and put missile defense systems on alert. But none of those options was specifically designed for drone warfare.

Although Russia and Ukraine have been firing more and more drones at each other, there has been less investment in counter-drone systems, Salm said. He suggested that's partly because it's easier to get a drone to fly than it is to develop something to detect or intercept it.

Slow, low-flying drones made from wood, fiberglass, plastic or polystyrene might not be detected by radar systems searching for a fast-moving missile made of metal, or they might look like birds or a plane. Enemy operatives can also bypass defenses by launching drones from inside a country, as Ukraine did to devastating effect when it attacked Russian airfields this year.

There are also other technological hurdles, including trying to jam the enemy's drones and communications without cutting your own, Merilo said.

In August, a Ukrainian drone — possibly sent off course by Russian electronic jamming — landed in a field in southeastern Estonia. It crashed because the military wasn't capable of detecting it, Merilo said.

The Estonian military and border force have also lost drones — used for surveillance and to stop illegal border crossings — to Russian jamming, which has also been blamed for disrupting flights.

Other drones have crashed in Romania, Moldova, Lithuania and Latvia, and there have been multiple unidentified drone sightings over military facilities and airports in Europe, including in Germany, the U.K., Norway and Denmark, where air traffic was halted for several hours at Copenhagen Airport on Monday.

The number of incidents shows that Europe needs to solve its drone problem “right now,” said Col. Māris Tūtins, head of information analysis and operations at Latvia's Joint Forces Headquarters.

There is growing support among European leaders for establishing some sort of drone wall along the EU's eastern border, though the 27-nation bloc in March denied funding to a joint Estonia-Lithuania proposal to establish one.

The EU needs to prioritize funding for the project, Pevkur said. But although support for the idea is growing, actually creating a drone defense system won't be easy.

“Drones are not mosquitoes,” the Estonian defense minister said, suggesting that they would be unlikely to be zapped by an “electronic wall” along NATO's borders.

There are many types of drones, including those used for intelligence and reconnaissance, that fly at high altitude, that are used in attacks or that even remain attached to a thin fiber-optic cable while flying, making them impossible to jam. Russia also uses decoy drones in Ukraine that carry no payload and are designed to exhaust air defenses. 

Any plan to defend against drones needs a multilayered approach, including sensors, “electronic warfare … also low-cost small missiles or attack drones,” Merilo said.

Although the need for better drone defenses isn't new, it's still largely only possible to buy systems that are “really expensive,” take a long time to develop and can't be mass-produced, Merilo said.

He suggested that's partly because big defense companies that have spent decades developing billion-dollar air defense systems might not want something new — and cheaper — on the market.

“We have to understand this game,” Merilo said, adding that some technology does exist, but “the question is who — and how fast they can start producing.” 

Facing nightly onslaughts, Ukraine is rapidly developing its own technology, including long-range attack drones and smaller ones for use on the front lines.

While big defense companies play a critical role in the defense of Europe, Latvia and some other NATO countries have turned to smaller companies — such as Salm's Frankenburg — to acquire its small anti-drone missiles once they're in production.

But a piecemeal approach isn't ideal, Salm said. Instead, the EU needs to invest more in European startups, which can turbocharge drone defense production that can be used by allies across different weapons systems, he said.

Europe needs to switch to “semi-wartime thinking” and foster greater collaboration between the military, government and defense industries to be able to fill its technology gap, Godliauskas said.

In Ukraine, it's sometimes only a matter of weeks between drone technology being developed and used on the battlefield. Europe “doesn't have time” to spend years waiting to acquire equipment, the Lithuanian official said. 

Another lesson from Ukraine is that what works today, might not work tomorrow, Godliauskas said.

While drone defense is critical now, it would be wrong to forget about everything else, Tūtins said. That's because Moscow is using “all means possible” to destabilize Europe, including hybrid warfare and cyberattacks, he said.

Texas Rep. Roger Williams discusses the congressional reaction to former President Trump's 'not guilty' plea and explains how the congressional baseball game showcases the greatness of America.

Republicans on the Small Business Committees face a deadline to scrap Biden-era rules requiring 10% of federal contract resources go to DEI, even as the USDOT warns Maryland over its handling of Francis Scott Key Bridge contracts.

In Congress, the SBIR and STTR programs – dubbed "America's seed fund(s)" – help small businesses apply for grants across federal agencies, in commercial and technology sectors, respectively.

Ahead of the September 30 reauthorization deadline for both key programs, Sen. Joni Ernst, chair of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, expressed urgency to cut out DEI requirements.

Ernst, R-Iowa, told Fox News Digital her INNOVATE Act – for which Rep. Roger Williams, R-Texas, also drafted a version earlier this summer – would replace any reauthorization legislation and remove requirements for DEI considerations and direct grants based on merit, not politics.

DUFFY CLASHES WITH DEMOCRATS OVER DEI FUNDING CUTS, DENIES AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS LET GO

Ernst also highlighted some of what she considered the more wasteful grants awarded under the current rubric – including a $1.4 million NIH appropriation for what was entitled a "Mobile App Promoting Sexual Health for Young Black Men Who Have Sex With Men."

Another healthcare-related grant she lambasted offered $283,526 for Evidence-Based Parent Training for Diverse Families – citing LGBTQ+ people whose "relationships do not fit within heterosexual…norms [and] are increasingly having children or considering" so. The Pentagon and other agencies had similar such grants approved under previous administrations, according to a source familiar.

With less than a week before the program sunsets unless Congress acts, a source familiar with the talks said many Republicans back Ernst's push to block such spending and grant rules but acknowledge the math is against them with Democrats united in opposition.

BRIDGE COLLAPSE AID BECOMES ECONOMIC WEAPON IN ESCALATING TRUMP-MOORE FEUD

Williams has favored a one-year extension of the current SBIR/STTR program with the clock winding down – giving time to focus on promptly reforming it without being under the gun -- but offered a ringing endorsement of both chambers' similar legislation.

"I want to thank Senator Ernst for her partnership when introducing the House version of her INNOVATE Act in July, and remain in lockstep with her on ensuring contracts are awarded based on merit, not DEI," Williams told Fox News Digital.

"We must ensure there is no lapse in funding for current, deserving SBIR/STTR participants before the September 30 deadline."

Meanwhile, across the Anacostia River from the Capitol, Maryland lawmakers got an earful from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy after he learned of that state's own rubric for similar contracts.

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore faces the daunting task of rebuilding the Francis Scott Key Bridge on the Baltimore Beltway after a freighter struck and destroyed it in 2024 – but the Trump administration cried foul at the way Annapolis purportedly is considering who will do the job.

Duffy wrote to Moore on Thursday thanking him for working with USDOT on the project but expressed concern that Annapolis may "intend to award contracts for the FSK Bridge project in a manner that relies on race and sex of contractors."

He warned the governor of the potential legal ramifications of doing so, citing the Civil Rights Act.

On the day it collapsed, then-President Joe Biden separately promised the federal government would cover the entire estimated $1.8 billion cost to make Interstate 695 a full circle once more, while Duffy instead referenced the state – as the MDTA controlled the FSK Bridge when it collapsed.

When asked about the letter, Moore provided Fox News Digital with a public response to Duffy:

"We will continue to work with the Trump Administration to find ways to reduce costs and rebuild faster," Moore said, in part. "We anticipate the price estimation process to be finalized in the coming months, and we will provide regular updates from the Maryland Department of Transportation about the project's status."

Moore has repeatedly highlighted progress MDTA has made on the bridge, telling President Donald Trump in an exchange captured by Fox Nation at the U.S. Naval Academy – just down the street from the State House — that "we will have it done in [20]28."

"In the meantime, we will continue to pursue litigation and make substantial financial contributions by way of advance construction costs and insurance settlement dollars to keep the project moving."

Moore – who announced last week he would seek re-election instead of a potential 2028 Democratic bid – added the safety of the new FSK Bridge and "sound stewardship" of Marylanders' tax dollars are paramount to both the Port of Baltimore and people across the country.

Jimmy Kimmel returned to late-night television after a nearly weeklong suspension and nearly broke down in tears, saying he wasn't trying to joke about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. (Sept. 23)

NEW YORK (AP) — Jimmy Kimmel returned to late-night television Tuesday after a nearly weeklong suspension and, in an emotional monologue where he appeared close to tears, said that he wasn't trying to joke about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

“I have no illusions about changing anyone's mind, but I do want to make something clear, because it's important to me as a human and that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man,” Kimmel said. “I don't think there's anything funny about it.”

He added that he wasn't trying to blame any specific group “for the actions of what ... was obviously a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make.” He said he understood his remarks last week to some “felt either ill-timed or unclear or maybe both.”




But he made no apologies. And he criticized the ABC affiliates who took his show off the air. Two stations groups that represent about a quarter of ABC stations, Sinclair and Nexstar, ordered their outlets not to show Kimmel on Tuesday.

“That's not American. It's un-American,” he said.



The incident triggered a national discussion about freedom of speech and President Donald Trump's ability to police the words of journalists, commentators and even comics. ABC suspended Kimmel's show last Wednesday following criticism of his remarks about the aftermath of Kirk's killing. But the network brought him back following a backlash against parent company Disney.

Kimmel thanked many supporters, including fellow late-night hosts past and present and even a former boss at a radio station in Seattle who checked in with him last week. He also singled out people he knows aren't fans of his comedy but stood up for his right to speak, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

“It takes courage for them to speak out against this administration,” he said. “They did, and they deserve credit for it.”

Kimmel nearly broke down again in praising Kirk's widow, Erika, who publicly forgave her husband's killer.

“That is an example we should follow,” he said. “If you believe in the teachings of Jesus as I do, there it was ... A selfless act of grace, forgiveness from a grieving widow. It touched me deeply. And I hope it touches many. And if there's anything we should take from this tragedy to carry forward, I hope it can be that. And not this.”

Kimmel admitted that he was mad when ABC suspended him, but praised his bosses for putting him back on the air. “Unjustly, this puts them at risk.”

He mocked Trump for criticizing him for bad ratings. “He tried his best to cancel me and instead he forced millions of people to watch this show,” Kimmel said.

The decisions by Sinclair and Nexstar left ABC stations in Washington, D.C.; St. Louis; Nashville, Tennessee, and Richmond, Virginia among the cities airing something else. WJLA-TV, the Sinclair-owned station in Washington, instead aired a newscast and an episode of the chain's show, “The National Desk.”

Kimmel's suspension came after an angry reaction to comments he made in monologues early last week. A relentless Trump critic in his comedy, Kimmel suggested that many Trump supporters were trying to capitalize on Kirk's death and were “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.”



Trump-appointed Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr last week said it appeared that Kimmel was trying to “directly mislead the American public” with his remarks about Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old Utah man charged with Kirk's killing, and his motives. Those motives remain unclear. Authorities say Robinson grew up in a conservative family, but his mother told investigators his son had turned left politically in the last year.

“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said before ABC announced the suspension. “These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”

Those remarks were key to the backlash, with Cruz saying that Carr acted like “a mafioso.” Hundreds of entertainment luminaries, including Tom Hanks, Barbra Streisand and Jennifer Aniston, signed a letter circulated by the American Civil Liberties Union that called ABC's move “a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation.”

Podcaster Joe Rogan weighed in Tuesday on Kimmel's side. “I definitely don't think that the government should be involved — ever — in dictating what a comedian can or can't say in a monologue,” Rogan said. “You are crazy for supporting this because this will be used on you.”

Some consumers punished ABC parent Disney by canceling subscriptions to its streaming services.

Trump had hailed Kimmel's suspension and criticized his return, writing on his Truth Social platform: “I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back ... Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who's not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE.”

Actor Robert De Niro appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on Tuesday, impersonating Carr being interviewed by Kimmel. De Niro, as Carr, said the FCC had a new motto, “Sticks and stones can break your bones.”

Isn't there more to the saying, Kimmel asked, that words can never hurt you?

“They can hurt you now,” De Niro responded, saying you have to make sure to say the right ones.

Kimmel took the stage to a long standing ovation and chants of “Jimmy, Jimmy.” One audience member, Walter Bates, said after the taping that Kimmel's discussion of Kirk's widow “was a very moving moment. I got very emotional and so did my wife.”

Trump's administration has used threats, lawsuits and federal government pressure to try to exert more control over the media industry. Trump sued ABC and CBS over news coverage, which the companies settled. Trump has also filed defamation lawsuits against The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, and successfully urged Congress to strip federal funding from NPR and PBS.

After pulling out of her planned performance at the premiere of Hulu's Lilith Fair documentary in protest over Kimmel's suspension, singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan appeared on Kimmel's show as the musical guest. McLachlan had been booked on the show prior to the preemption, a representative told The Associated Press.

The other guest was actor Glen Powell.

The suspension happened at a time when the late-night landscape is shifting. Shows are losing viewers, in part because many watch highlights the next day online. CBS announced the cancellation of “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert's show over the summer. Kimmel's contract with ABC reportedly lasts through May.

Colbert, in his own monologue Monday shortly after ABC announced Kimmel would return, grabbed his recently won Emmy Award for outstanding talk series, saying, “Once more, I am the only martyr on late night!”

Fox News' Griff Jenkins reports the latest on the shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas. 

At least three people were shot, one of whom was killed, in a shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas on Wednesday, Fox News confirmed.

The FBI says it is investigating the incident as a "targeted attack" against ICE, and multiple sources familiar with the investigation have identified the alleged shooter as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn. Representatives for the FBI at a Wednesday morning press conference in Dallas said that preliminary investigations uncovered anti-ICE messaging on bullet rounds found near the shooter.

The shooting reportedly occurred as ICE officers were transferring detainees into the facility. The shooter died due to a self-inflicted wound shortly after the attack, authorities say. The three individuals who were shot were all detainees, and one of them has died.

The three detainees were shot while inside a law enforcement van, ICE sources told Fox News' Brooke Taylor.

"These despicable, politically motivated attacks against law enforcement are not a one-off. We are only miles from Prarieland Texas where just two months ago an individual ambushed a separate ICE facility targeting their officers. It has to end and the FBI and our partners will lead the these investigative efforts to see to it that those who target our law enforcement are pursued and brought to the fullest extent of justice," FBI director Kash Patel wrote on X.

Authorities say Patel was in Dallas for a "prescheduled visit" on Wednesday morning. The FBI says he visited law enforcement at the "incident command location" following the attack.

The Dallas Police Department sources told Fox News the shooting occurred at roughly 6:30 a.m. local time. They say no law enforcement officers were injured, but that three detainees were shot and two were killed.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed there were "multiple fatalities."

"There was a shooting this morning at the Dallas ICE Detention Facility," Noem wrote on X. "Details are still emerging but we can confirm there were multiple injuries and fatalities. The shooter is deceased by a self-inflicted gunshot wound."

"While we don't know motive yet, we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them. It must stop. Please pray for the victims and their families," she added.

Authorities say the shooter opened fire when the sally port to the facility was open during the transfer of detainees, attempting to force his way in.

Multiple people were shot and killed in an "attack" on an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas on Wednesday, September 24, 2025. 

"The obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop. I'm praying for everyone hurt in this attack and for their families," Vice President JD Vance wrote on X.

DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughin noted during an appearance on Fox News that it was "just a month ago to the day that there was a viable bomb threat" in Dallas.

"So this location, it looks like it's been targeted, and we don't know how long this individual has been planning this act. It looks like he could have been watching to look at the processing and see what happens on a day-to-day basis at this Dallas field office. But [these are] all answers that Homeland Security investigation is going to get down to the bottom of," McLaughlin added.

She reiterated calls for critics of ICE to tone down their rhetoric after the attack.

"We don't want to get anyone killed," she said.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, also appeared at Wednesday's press conference and Dallas and condemned the attack, saying, "Violence has no place. It is wrong. If we want to have a debate about immigration we can do so in the halls of Congress."

Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Texas, who represents the district containing the ICE facility, said his office is aware of the shooting and is monitoring the situation.

"We are keeping the victims in prayer and will update the North Texas community as we get news on their conditions and learn more about the suspect," Veasey wrote on X.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott reacted to the attack on Wednesday, framing it as an "assassination.

"Texas fully supports ICE," Abbott wrote. "Both the Texas Dept. of Public Safety & Texas National Guard work closely with ICE. This assassination will NOT slow our arrest, detention, and deportation of illegal immigrants. We will work with ICE and the Dallas Police Dept. to get to the bottom of the assassin's motive. We will offer ICE additional support to assist their operations," he added.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins explains how the USDA is tackling a flesh-eating parasite that can threaten American cattle and sounds the alarm on how much farmland China owns on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Mexico activated emergency controls Monday after detecting a new case of New World screwworm in cattle in the northern border state of Nuevo Leon, the closest case to the U.S. border since the outbreak began last year.

The animal, found in the town of Sabinas Hidalgo, came from the Gulf state of Veracruz, Mexico's National Health for Food Safety and Food Quality Service said. 

The last case was reported July 9 in Veracruz, prompting Washington to suspend imports of live Mexican cattle.

The parasite, a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly, attacks warm-blooded animals, including humans. Mexico has reported more than 500 active cases in cattle across southern states.

The block on cattle imports has spelled trouble for Mexico's government, which has already been busy trying to offset the brunt of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats this year.

The government and ranchers have sought to get the ban lifted. 

If it stays in place through the year, Mexico's ranching federation estimates losses up to $400 million.

"It is extremely concerning for the American cattle industry that New World screwworm has moved so far north in Mexico and now is just 70 miles from the border," Colin Woodall, CEO of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, said in a statement.

"The speed that screwworm has moved through Mexico is a reminder that this pest poses a critical and urgent threat to America's cattle producers."

Mollie Engelhart, a former vegan restaurateur who is now a Texas rancher, told Fox News Digital she's "very concerned" about the screwworm situation.

"I believe that the most important thing for our cattle industry right now is to bring our herd size up and the diversification of our processing for major packers," Engelhart said, adding that she believes there is a greater need for local food processing than ever before.

Mexico's Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegué said in a post on X that Mexico is "controlling the isolated case of screwworm in Nuevo Leon," under measures to fight the pest agreed with the U.S. in August.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Washington will take "decisive measures to protect our borders, even in the absence of cooperation," and said imports of Mexican cattle, bison and horses will remain suspended.

"We will not rely on Mexico to defend our industry, our food supply or our way of life," she said.

New York resident Jon Barr went to Rhode Island's The Nordic, one of the most expensive all-you-can-eat buffets in America, and reveals why it's worth the price tag.

An 18-year-old man ate 40 pieces of sashimi — thinly sliced raw fish and seafood — at a family lunch to celebrate his acceptance into law school as an undergraduate, only to have his mother say he embarrassed her and made it appear she didn't feed him enough.

"I recently got into law school and am now an LLB [bachelor of law] student," the man wrote in a Reddit forum. "My parents decided to take me to a special lunch at a buffet as a reward."

Aunts, uncles and cousins attended the lunch, he said. 

IS IT 'RUDE' TO BOX UP LEFTOVERS WHEN SOMEONE ELSE PAYS? FATHER-SON FEUD SPARKS DEBATE

The man said he didn't usually eat much for lunch because he'd been saving money to buy textbooks. At the buffet, however, he decided to indulge, especially in sashimi, a Japanese delicacy.

"This was a buffet, and they had some really nice dishes," he wrote. "I sampled many things and ended up wolfing down 40 pieces of sashimi. … I know because I went to the counter five times and got eight pieces each time."

A young man (not pictured) wrote in a Reddit post that his mom was embarrassed by how much he ate at a buffet with family and friends. (iStock)

"My dad didn't say anything, but my mom later told me I embarrassed her by eating like a starving kid – that the amount I ate made it look like she didn't feed me enough," the son continued. "She was very upset about it."

Many commenters jumped in to say that eating a lot is the point of a buffet. 

AUNT BLAMES NIECE AFTER ACCIDENTALLY EATING DOG FOOD DURING VISIT, SPARKING FAMILY DRAMA

"You're an 18-year-old male," one Reddit user wrote. "Isn't it common knowledge that your type can eat staggering amounts in one sitting?"

Another person said his mom's reaction was like "taking a kid to an amusement park and then scolding them for having too much fun."

The young man said he took five helpings of sashimi at a celebratory buffet with his family. (iStock)

Others said they would be cheering on the student for getting his money's worth.

"I doubt anyone except your mom noticed or cared that you were eating a lot," another commenter noted.

"If a child eats like they're starving, it can feel to a parent like an unspoken criticism of their caregiving."

Parents often tie their child's behavior back to themselves, said Sandra Kushnir, a licensed marriage and family therapist and CEO of Meridian Counseling in Los Angeles.

"Food is deeply tied to notions of care," Kushnir told Fox News Digital. "Many parents see it as an expression of love and responsibility. If a child eats like they're starving, it can feel to a parent like an unspoken criticism of their caregiving."

FAMILY VACATION DRAMA ERUPTS OVER GRANDMOTHER'S REQUEST FOR DINNER WITH HER GROWN KIDS ONLY

She suggested the son acknowledge his mom's feelings without taking blame and saying, "I see that it upset you because of how it looked, but I wasn't trying to send that message. I was just excited and enjoying the food."

Kushnir added, "By validating her feelings while clarifying his intention, he opens space for understanding rather than defensiveness."

While most Redditors sided with the original poster, some felt otherwise.

Most Reddit users sided with the ravenous young man, while a few sympathized with the appalled mother. (iStock)

"Forty pieces of sashimi sounds like quite a lot," one person said. "But I don't see why it couldn't be eaten in a polite, civilized manner. Then again, your mom's reaction suggests that perhaps it wasn't."

Another person sympathized with the mother, writing, "I'd be slightly uncomfortable, too, in such a situation. That's totally not your fault, though."

Annalisa Nash Fernandez, an intercultural strategist at Connecticut-based Because Culture, said buffets come with a kind of social contract.

"The person piling their plate high breaks an unspoken covenant," Fernandez told Fox News Digital. "Not because of food scarcity in most contexts, but because they've violated the kind of restraint that makes communal abundance possible."

Some people argue there is no such thing as taking or eating "too much" at a buffet as long as table manners are followed. (iStock)

Other etiquette experts, however, said there is no such thing as having "too much" at a buffet.

"As long as you're following whatever rules the buffet has set and are using your best table manners, then you're probably in the clear, etiquette-wise," said Nick Leighton, a New York-based co-host of the podcast "Were You Raised By Wolves?"

He added, "Etiquette cares about pacing, and it looks far less gluttonous to go back for seconds – or thirds – on [a] fresh plate."

What if I told you 10 years ago that a presidential nominee who received more votes than any other woman in history and nearly won the presidency was relegated to the dustbin of history less than one year later?

Would that seem plausible? Well, it's happening before our eyes.

HARRIS WARNS DEMOCRATS AGAINST FIXATION ON MAMDANI: ‘NOT THE ONLY STAR'

Former Vice President Kamala Harris launched the book tour that nobody asked for on Tuesday. The title of her tome, 107 Days, chronicles what can be considered the worst presidential campaign of our lifetimes. Team Harris blew through $1.5 billion in cash, and then some, ending up in debt, and got zero return on investment by losing every swing state and the popular vote, while also surrendering control of the Senate. In the end, and this number is truly something, 89% of counties in the U.S. went more red than blue when compared to the 2020 election.

“This is the first book to begin in Chapter 11,” Fox News's Jimmy Failia joked this week on America's Newsroom.

As she often has done throughout her political career, Harris uses the book to do the same thing Hillary Clinton did for her loss, “What Happened,” in 2016: blame almost everyone but herself. And she's doing this while also laughably claiming that if she just had more time to campaign, the result would have been different.

Actually, it was quite the opposite: The more she spoke, the more she was seen, the more her poll numbers went in the wrong direction. Think back to late July and August 2024: Harris is installed as the Democratic nominee without one vote from the public after President Joe Biden is tossed aside by his own party following a horrific debate performance in late June.

But what did her team do for the first six weeks of the campaign? Not allow her to do even one sit-down interview, even in the most friendly confines of MSNBC, CNN, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, or The View. So it's a bit rich for Harris to lament not having more time to make her case to the electorate while allowing herself to be sidelined.

But her campaign likely knew what many of us already did: Outside of prepared remarks in a teleprompter, Harris is a human Chernobyl. She simply has no talent for thinking or speaking extemporaneously. And when she has tried to do so in the past, such as her first run for president in 2020, she dropped out before the first votes were cast in Iowa.

It is ironic that Harris's team has chosen The View for her first broadcast network interview for the book tour. It was here in October 2024 that her campaign essentially ended: Sunny Hostin asked her a T-ball question about what she would do differently than Biden.

“You know … there is not a thing that comes to mind,” she answered while looking skyward.

Game. Set. Match.

Here was Democratic strategist James Carville‘s reaction: “The country wants something different. And she's asked, as is so often the case, in a friendly audience, on The View, ‘How would you be different than Biden?' That's the one question that you exist to answer, all right? That is it. That's the money question. That's the one you want. That's the one that everybody wants to know the answer to. And you freeze! You literally freeze and say, ‘Well, I can't think of anything'”

Usually, a major book tour like this is used as a stepping stone to another campaign. But it's virtually impossible to see Harris running again. This isn't Ronald Reagan coming back in 1980 after falling just short of the nomination in '76. Her base is nonexistent. Most people who voted for Harris were voting against Trump.

A recent poll from Atlas Intel, the most accurate pollster of the 2024 election, has Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) easily on top when polling Democratic voters as to their preferred nominee at 37.6%. Harris, despite being vice president for four years and getting more than 75 million votes less than one year ago, is a distant second at 20.5%. Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg (12.1%), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) (10.8%), and Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) (3.6%) round out the top five.

Speaking of Walz, who did the Harris campaign no favors as her running mate, thanks to him lying about fighting in war zones and claiming he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square riots — he was in Nebraska — Harris says she was forced into choosing the goofy governor of Minnesota because America wasn't ready for a gay vice president in Pete Buttigieg.

As for her relationship with Biden, Harris claimed that she couldn't ask him not to run again before accusing him of being reckless by staying in. “It's Joe and Jill's decision,” she writes. “We all said that, like a mantra, as if we'd all been hypnotized. Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high. This wasn't a choice that should have been left to an individual's ego, an individual's ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.”

Again, this is all so phony. She knew what his cognitive state was and lied directly to the public about it. Here's what Harris said right after Biden's debate against Trump that ended his political career: “Joe Biden is extraordinarily strong.” She then said, with a straight face to Anderson Cooper on CNN that night, Biden had a “slow start” but a “strong finish,” an assessment that exactly zero other people came away with. “He got into a groove where it counted,” she later told MSNBC. “Our president showed that he will win the election.”

Uh-huh.

Harris is doing herself no favors with this book, and this already feels more like a revenge tour. How is Walz feeling today after hearing that he wasn't her first choice as her running mate? How do the Bidens feel about her calling them self-serving?

On Tuesday, she sat down with Michael Strahan on Good Morning America. And her answer to the question, “Do you think Biden could have run the country for four years?” was met with the ultimate incoherent word salad.

“My concern about him running for reelection was completely separate from his capacity to serve … which was consistent and never wavered.”

So, she thinks Biden couldn't campaign for a few months, but could run the country for another four years? How does this remotely make sense?

Harris's book will finish at No. 1 on the bestseller lists. She likely got a hefty advance from Simon & Schuster. On that front, the book is a success.

DESANTIS UNVEILS PLANS FOR TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY IN MIAMI

But given that she and her husband are already worth millions, this isn't about the money. It's about getting back into power again.

And thanks to napalming every remaining bridge to those who were once her allies, it's safe to say this will be the last we see of Harris on any major political stage again.

Decoding online “psychobabble” with a real therapist.

Joe Nucci, like many brand-new therapists, loved showing off his fancy new psychology vocabulary during grad school. All these diagnoses and concepts were exciting, Nucci says, and helped explain so much. But as he continued his schooling, he realized that applying those terms in everyday life could be perilous.

Some self-help creators online could use a bit of that wisdom. As the stigma surrounding mental health has waned over the last 10 years, an influx of well-meaning influencers and consumers looking to understand more about themselves may have bought into flattened descriptions of popular terms — like boundaries or narcissism — or have internalized simplistic ideas about their emotions. “I was noticing that not only was some of it just technically incorrect, but it was being explained or applied in a way that ultimately was harmful,” Nucci says. “If people were taking that advice too literally or without the important missing nuance, it could lead to decisions that would actually hurt mental health and not help it.”

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

So Nucci, a licensed psychotherapist in private practice with over 250,000 followers on Instagram, set out to dispel some of those myths — to correct the therapy-speak that has come to dominate mental health. In Psychobabble: Viral Mental Health Myths and the Truths to Set You Free, Nucci outlines over three dozen misconceptions that have rampantly circulated online. Here, he discusses seven of the most pervasive, how we got here, and how to fight back.

Over the last decade or so, Nucci has noticed discussions around diagnoses morph from “You have X disorder” and “You are so much more than a label” to “almost a personality feature,” he says. Diagnoses are best utilized to inform a treatment plan to promote better functioning, Nucci says. But when people wear their diagnoses like a label, it may become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Those with ADHD, for example, may run late because they are distracted, he explains. “With the right medication, with the right mindset shifts, with the right coaching and executive functioning training, you can actually minimize how often you run late and to the point where you're not running late any more than the typical person,” he says. But if you believe running late is an unchangeable facet of your personality, you may make the symptoms worse and close yourself off to improvement.

Instead of relying on one term to define yourself, Nucci suggests highlighting many of your qualities using a variety of words: creative, outgoing, scatterbrained at times. “We need to be using more language,” he says, “not less.”

Nucci takes issue with the term “people pleaser” because it isn't specific and could refer to any number of behaviors. “Are you going along with things and then elevating your sense of moral superiority?” he says. “Are you self-sacrificing for one reason or another?” Some people may just be more agreeable than others and take pleasure when deferring to loved ones.

So-called people pleasing becomes problematic when it's motivated by conflict aversion — you're afraid of upsetting a friend so you don't voice your opinion even when you want to. In his own life, Nucci has been working on standing his ground and trying not to assume others are mad at him — he's been open with friends and family about it. “People, overall, were really supportive,” he says.

Like many pop psychology-related concepts, the widely accepted definition of “love bombing” has shifted. Originally intended to refer to a manipulation tactic where love and affection are used to control another person, the understanding of love bombing tends to point to any relationship that's progressing quickly. “There are so many reasons why people move fast in dating,” Nucci says: lust, infatuation, falling for an idea of a person, confused expectations.

Just because someone has intense feelings early in a relationship doesn't necessarily mean they're attempting to manipulate their romantic partner.

Other popular mental health-related terms have also followed a similar trajectory: think about the social media posts you've seen referring to people as “toxic” or “narcissists.”

As for love bombing, just because someone has intense feelings early in a relationship doesn't necessarily mean they're attempting to manipulate their romantic partner. Nor does taking a pause to slow things down if you're considering whether to continue dating after the initial infatuation has worn off.

Inspired by a metaphor he often saw online — “A flower isn't doing well. Do you blame the flower, or do you blame the quality of the soil, the air, the sunlight?” — Nucci believes both systemic societal issues and personal autonomy play a role in mental health. Racism, sexism, discrimination, and any number of systemic issues have certainly impacted his patients, Nucci says, but it's important for mental health practitioners to remember their patients have agency, too.

Sometimes, repeatedly reminding people of all the ways the world is unfair may prevent them from seeing a way forward. “If you're on the really extreme end of prioritizing systemic justice,” Nucci says, “there's going to be situations in which you could actually do something as an individual. You don't want to be so rigid in that stance that you miss the easy wins of stuff you can do and stuff that you can work on.”

At the same time, it is important to acknowledge external forces you can't control. Being wholly committed to the idea that you can change your circumstances if you just work hard enough might only lead to burnout, exhaustion, and frustration. “You're not actually advancing towards the goals that you value,” Nucci says. “Is it adaptive of you to take a step back, to take a deep breath and look at your context, look at the system that you're in? Maybe that's your family, maybe that's your culture or country. … That can also be really, really healing.”

Becoming an amateur expert in mental health concepts doesn't equate with healing, Nucci says. In therapy, counselors typically begin by helping patients name their experiences, process them, and analyze them, he explains. “Sometimes, when people are able to articulate a cogent analysis, their symptoms go away — not always, but sometimes,” Nucci says. “At that point you want to stop analyzing, because if you continue, it quickly becomes obsessing, ruminating.”

In which case, learning more or digging deeper emotionally might not help. Instead, therapists could turn their approach to other forms of treatment, like cognitive behavioral therapy, which focuses on shifting thought patterns, or behavioral therapy, where you work on changing your actions. Suffice to say, endlessly trying to learn about mental health concepts and terminology online can also become counterproductive outside of a therapeutic environment.

Most people differ in how open and vulnerable they expect their romantic relationships to be. Some want their significant other to be extremely expressive and raw; others might not be comfortable divulging everything to their spouse. You shouldn't feel bad if you don't want to tell your partner what you'd tell your therapist. “The type of intimacy that you would give your therapist, the types of details, the types of stuff you would talk about, I would not necessarily recommend speaking to your partner that way,” Nucci says.

The same goes for your children. Just because you'd confide in a friend about trauma from your past doesn't mean it's necessarily appropriate to disclose that to your kids.

Vulnerability is important in close relationships, but it doesn't mean you have to be totally vulnerable with every person you meet. “Maybe only one person gets that vulnerability with you,” Nucci says. “Maybe it's your partner, maybe it's your therapist, maybe it's a friend.”

While therapists are certainly qualified to treat patients on their mental health journeys, they are not “wise sages” on all topics, Nucci says, especially love. Therapy can help you identify unhelpful patterns in relationships and give you skills to help fix them, but it won't replace the experience of actually dating.

“You've got to learn to put yourself back out there, and that's all any of us can do,” Nucci says. “If that's something you're struggling with, therapy can be a great intermediate support for you, but I think it's inaccurate to say that it will make you completely ready.”

            A man in his forties has been arrested in connection to a cyber attack that knocked out automatic check-in systems at some of Europe's busiest airports last week.
    


            The man, who was arrested in West Sussex, England, on Tuesday evening, was detained on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences, the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) said in a statement shared with CNN. He has been released on conditional bail.
    


            “Although this arrest is a positive step, the investigation into this incident is in its early stages and remains ongoing,” Paul Foster, head of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit, said in the statement,
    


            “Cybercrime is a persistent global threat that continues to cause significant disruption to the UK. Alongside our partners here and overseas, the NCA is committed to reducing that threat in order to protect the British public,” he added.
    


            Last Friday, aviation company Collins Aerospace was targeted in the cyber attack, sparking disruption for passengers who were set to depart from cities including London, Brussels, Berlin and Dublin.
    


            Brussels Airport used iPads and laptops to check passengers in online, while a passenger at Berlin Brandenburg Airport told Reuters that travelers were being given handwritten boarding passes.
    


            In a statement on Wednesday morning, Berlin's airport said disruption was continuing.
    


            “Given that check-in and boarding are still largely manual, longer processing times, delays, and cancellations by airlines may continue today despite the mobilization of all available resources,” the airport said, adding that it is working on “alternative solutions to minimize the impact” of the cyberattack on passengers.
    


            London's Heathrow said Wednesday that the majority of its flights are “operating as normal.” Brussels Airport said Tuesday that there may still be “limited disruption” to flights because of the cyberattack.

Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) is investigating a Virginia school following allegations that a school official “arranged and bankrolled abortions” without parental consent.

Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) directed the Virginia state police to look into the allegations last month.

“As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), I am committed to ensuring parents are empowered with timely access to information necessary to protect their children from the threat of serious harm,” Cassidy wrote. “If these reports are true, they represent a betrayal of Fairfax County parents and families and warrant comprehensive oversight by the HELP Committee to determine how this could have occurred and who must be held accountable.”

A school social worker allegedly helped a 17-year-old girl at Centreville High School to have an abortion, while another girl “fled” an abortion clinic in fear of having an abortion. Fairfax County Public Schools has been accused of hiding the allegations.

“As Chairman of the HELP Committee, I am determined to ensure that federal education funds arenot being misused in violation of the law and parents' rights to protect their children,” he wrote.

“Given the seriousness of the allegations and the potential that federal funds were used by school officials to pressure minor students into receiving covert abortions without parental consent, it is imperative for the Committee to determine whether any federal funds were misused and whether the Hyde Amendment or other relevant laws were violated,” he added.

A TIMELINE OF TRUMP AND EPSTEIN'S RELATIONSHIP, FROM FRIENDSHIP TO FALLOUT AND BEYOND

Cassidy is asking the FCPS superintendent several questions, including about the school system's reporting requirements and other issues involving abortions and student pregnancies.

He's asking for a response to his questions by Oct. 6.

An emotional monologue, a takedown of Trump, and a victory for individual action.

Our great national censorship nightmare is over — but only for about three-quarters of the ABC stations in America.

Jimmy Kimmel was back on the air Tuesday night after Disney, the parent company of ABC, reversed its decision last week to suspend his talk show over comments he made about MAGA supporters' response to the killing of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk. That initial pause came after increasing pressure from the Trump administration and two TV station groups — Nexstar and the conservative-leaning Sinclair — which said last week they would not air Kimmel's show.

Whether or not you like Kimmel, his show's return Tuesday night was a triumph for a few reasons. First, it was a victory for free speech: the return of a show that was taken off the airwaves in part because of oblique threats from the Trump-era Federal Communications Commission's leadership, and the rebuffing of what my colleague Zack Beauchamp has called a “climate of fear and censorship” in the wake of Kirk's death, championed by conservative activists.

Second, it was also a new kind of (partial) victory for liberals and their resistance efforts in the second Trump term.

Led by celebrities, podcasters, influencers, and the grassroots — as opposed to any institutions, corporations, billionaires, or political parties — it managed to get a major corporation to resist Trump and restore Kimmel, even though his show is only returning to about three-quarters of the ABC-affiliated TV stations in America.

While a variety of voices pushed back against this attempt at corporate censorship, Nexstar and Sinclair continued to boycott Kimmel's show last night — airing local news segments instead of Jimmy Kimmel Live! in the nearly 25 percent of local ABC affiliates across the country that they own. They don't show signs of reversing course yet. And it's not clear what mechanism — if any — Kimmel supporters have to influence either corporation to change its policy for now.

Tuesday night's monologue might end up being the moment Kimmel revived this new type of resistance — or it might get lost in another wave of Trump-induced news and scandal. It will surely be one of his best-rated shows. He came out swinging against Trump, his efforts to punish his critics, and the FCC's chief, Brendan Carr. Kimmel didn't directly apologize — and instead made an impassioned case for further Trump resistance, called in surprise guest (and Trump archenemy) Robert De Niro, and joked about Trump's physical appearance and the likelihood of an Epstein Files drop “to distract us from this now. … He tried his best to cancel me, instead he forced millions of people to watch the show. That backfired bigly.”

His case against Trump was simple. “The president of the United States made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs. Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods because he can't take a joke,” he said, holding back tears throughout the address. “A government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn't like is anti-American. There is some solidarity on that from the right and the left and those in the middle. Maybe the silver lining from this is we found one thing we can agree on, and maybe we'll even find another one.”

No less potently, Kimmel didn't identify as a liberal or a Democrat when attacking Trump, but as an American. Kimmel, who joked that he barely paid attention in school, said he never expected to be in his current position — fighting a war of principle against a would-be American despot — but that he was taught by comedians such as Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, and Howard Stern that censoring comedians is “un-American.” This was not a progressive or a liberal's cry of rage; Kimmel attacked Trump from the absolute dead-center.

Although Kimmel came out strong in his return, there are still other obstacles to reclaiming his former audience. Sinclair and Nexstar are continuing their boycott of his show, setting up a potential showdown with Disney and ABC in the coming days. Sinclair's position seems ideological — demanding Kimmel apologize to Kirk's family and make a “meaningful” contribution to Kirk's activist group Turning Point USA. Nexstar argues that Kimmel's speech was harmful — though the company has a deal merging with Tegna, another major station owner, pending before Trump's FCC.

Combined, their stations reach nearly a quarter of the American viewing public — meaning millions of Americans (in cities like Washington, DC, Nashville, Salt Lake City, Seattle, and St Louis) who might want to watch Kimmel's show simply can't turn on their televisions and do so (I, for one, had to watch his monologue on a clandestine TikTok livestream from my phone).

Kimmel noted much of this during his monologue — citing pressure on affiliates in cities to not air his show and the slippery slope it might create in the future: “Should the government be able to regulate which podcasts the cellphone companies and wifi providers are allowed to let you download to make sure they serve the public interest?” His studio audience responded with a resounding, “No!” Kimmel and the decision-makers at the Mickey Mouse company might be hoping the rest of the country will keep feeling this way — but who knows if this fracas will be remembered beyond being just one more Trump scandal.

As the first few months of the second Trump term have shown, other major companies, law firms, universities, and organizations have acquiesced in the face of confrontation with the president. And massive street protests have been absent.

That's part of what makes this moment of individual-led backlash seem so noteworthy — and one reason why it's not clear that it can be replicated. Kimmel raised this specter Tuesday night too, noting Trump's apparent desire to go after late-night comics specifically will probably continue.

“Somehow, [he was able to] squeeze Colbert out of CBS, then he turned his sights on me, and now he's openly rooting for NBC to fire Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers and the hundreds of Americans who work for their shows,” he said. “And I hope that if that happens, or if there's even any hint of that happening, you will be 10 times as loud as you were this week. We have to speak out against this. He is not stopping. And it's not just comedy. He's gunning for our journalists too.”

In the week or so that Kimmel was off the air, the strongest efforts to push back against Trump and conservative efforts to censor Kimmel did not come from corporations, the stock market, or a major political institution. Instead, it was primarily driven by “talent” — actors, comedians, podcasters, and other individuals with a built-in audience and a public platform.

It came from the hundreds of Hollywood movie stars, comedians, and other celebrities who signed open letters: one from the ACLU with more than 400 A-list signers, including De Niro, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, and Lin-Manuel Miranda; and another of more than 600 comedians, including Rosie O'Donnell, Kathy Griffin, and Chelsea Handler.

It was musicians like Sarah McLachlan, Jewel, and Olivia Rodrigo who backed out of promotional events and appearances for Disney-backed projects, and at least one TV writer who said they wouldn't work with Disney in protest. It was current and past Marvel stars posting critically about Disney and free speech to their followers (Marvel Studios is owned by Disney).

And it was other current or former late-night and TV show hosts like Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, Jimmy Fallon, David Letterman, and Seth Meyers that dedicated their monologues, segments of their shows, or in-person appearances over the last week to pillory Trump and the FCC, and to support Kimmel.

It was “a blatant assault on freedom of speech,” Colbert, whose own show is being scrapped under dubious circumstances, warned in his monologue last week. “We all see where this is going. … You can't go around firing somebody because you're fearful or trying to suck up to an authoritarian — a criminal — administration in the Oval Office,” Letterman warned at a festival appearance last week. “It is possible to stand up to this kind of bullying and censorship,” Meyers said to his own audience on Monday night.

Even some of the podcasters and new media stars that often sympathize with MAGA voiced concerns over the last week. “Manosphere” influencers like the comedians Andrew Schulz and Akaash Singh spent time on their show and on social media explaining why conservatives should be outraged. Meanwhile, media personalities at the sports and pop culture brand Barstool Sports debated each other on whether the suspension was, in fact, government censorship.

And though it took him some time to record an episode and he didn't call out Trump by name, Joe Rogan, probably the most vocal “free speech” defender of the podcasting world, ultimately criticized the FCC, too, and warned those cheering Kimmel's silencing that the same powers could be used on them in the future on Tuesday.

Individually, each of these statements, posts, and actions reached very different segments of the American public; in today's siloed media and information ecosystem, perhaps none of them share an audience. But combined, they helped to spur on a tidal wave of pressure and criticism on Disney, its leadership, and its bottom line. Many of these same celebrities helped to encourage grassroots cancellations and boycotts of Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions, as well as its theme parks — which seem to have actually caused some economic damage.

Kimmel referenced almost all of this during his opening monologue last night: He thanked his fellow comedians; he joked about the mass subscription cancellations; he thanked those “people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” including Rogan, Sen. Ted Cruz, and other conservative media voices. And he set himself up to be, if only for one night, Hollywood's Resistance leader.

Of course, Trump weighed in before Kimmel even started speaking with another threat: “I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative,” he posted on Truth Social.

In the meantime, Disney will continue to allow streaming subscribers to watch Kimmel on Hulu (whose price is about to get higher), even if Nexstar and Sinclair-run local affiliates maintain their refusal to play his show on their stations. And while ABC and Disney's brass may feel they deserve some credit for Kimmel's reinstatement — Kimmel thanked them for bringing him back and supporting his show over the years, though “unfortunately, and I think unjustly, this puts them at risk” — the extent of their willingness to fight Trump and a weaponized FCC remain open questions.

            Surrounding our solar system is a natural and enigmatic cosmic shield called the heliosphere — and a new mission has launched to help astronomers better understand it.
    


            Created by the solar wind, a constant flow of charged particles that stream away from the sun, the heliosphere acts as an enormous bubble that protects the planets in our solar system from cosmic radiation permeating the Milky Way, our home galaxy.
    


            In addition to Earth's protective magnetic field, the heliosphere plays a major role in why life is possible on our planet — and how it perhaps once existed on others such as Mars.
    


            Over half a dozen missions   have contributed to how astronomers understand the heliosphere, and two enduring spacecraft, the Voyager probes, have collected key data after exiting the heliosphere to explore interstellar space.
    


            But the new IMAP, or Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe, mission is designed to investigate how the sun forms its solar wind, and how that solar wind interacts with interstellar space at the boundary of the heliosphere, which begins at a range three times the distance between Earth and Pluto, according to NASA.
    


            The spacecraft's 10 instruments will also fill gaps in the existing map of the heliosphere, pieced together from data collected by previous missions, and help further explain how the heliosphere largely shields our solar system from damaging cosmic rays, the most highly energetic particles in the universe.
    


            Along with two other space weather missions that lifted off aboard the same rocket on Wednesday, IMAP will help scientists better predict when solar storms unleashed by the sun could affect our planet. When aimed at Earth, harsh radiation from the storms, also known as space weather, can pose risks to astronauts on the International Space Station as well as interfere with communications, the electric power grid, navigation, and radio and satellite operations.
    


            “This next set of missions is the ultimate cosmic carpool,” said Dr. Joe Westlake, director of NASA's Heliophysics Division, during a news conference on Sunday. “They will provide unprecedented insight into space weather. Every human on Earth, as well as nearly every system involved in space exploration and human needs, is affected by space weather.”
    


            The heliosphere was first theorized by multiple scientists investigating the concept of cosmic rays and the solar wind in the late 1950s, according to NASA. They believed the sun provided a web of magnetic fields and solar wind that created a boundary surrounding Earth and the rest of the solar system.
    


Mariner 2, the first successful mission to another planet that performed a flyby of Venus in 1962, also was the first to measure the solar wind, proving its existence. Direct measurements taken by the Pioneer 10 and 11 missions in the 1970s, as well as the Voyager probes, provided further proof of the heliosphere.
    


            Scientists are eager to know what the boundaries of the heliosphere look like, something that the Voyager probes have offered tantalizing glimpses of in the past. They are the only two spacecraft to cross the heliosphere.
    


            Voyager 1 reached the heliosphere boundary in 2012, while the slower Voyager 2 crossed the boundary in 2018, providing snapshots in two specific locations. The information collected by these probes is helping scientists learn about the heliosphere's cometlike shape.
    


            The IBEX, or Interstellar Boundary Explorer, satellite has been mapping the heliosphere since launching in 2008. But IMAP can explore and map the boundaries of the heliosphere like never before because it has instruments with faster imaging that are capable of 30 times higher resolution.
    


            Once it reaches an orbit about 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth in about three months, IMAP will also capture observations of the solar wind in real time and measure particles that travel from the sun, study the heliosphere's boundary between 6 billion and 9 billion miles (9.7 billion to 14.5 billion kilometers) away, and even collect data from interstellar space.
    


            Predominately, IMAP will measure energetic neutral atoms, called ENAs, or uncharged particles that form when an energetic charged ion collides with a slow-moving neutral atom. The process that forms these particles, found wherever there is plasma, or charged gas, in space, also occurs throughout the heliosphere and along its boundary. IMAP will rely on tracking these particles to create a more complete map of the heliosphere, according to NASA.
    


            The particles travel in a straight line, unaffected by magnetic fields because they are not charged, so IMAP can collect ENAs near Earth and trace them to their origins, like the otherwise invisible boundaries of the heliosphere, according to NASA.
    


            “IMAP is going to make incredibly detailed pictures that will evolve over time of that interaction region,” said Dr. David McComas, IMAP's principal investigator and an astrophysicist at Princeton University. “It will be able to understand what the shielding is, how the shielding works and what it looks like.”
    


            McComas added that our solar system is not alone in having something like a heliosphere, and bright astrospheres  have been spotted around other stars.
    


            IMAP launched alongside NASA's Carruthers Geocorona Observatory and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's SWFO-L1, or Space Weather Follow On-Lagrange 1, on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday at 7:30 a.m. ET. NASA streamed the launch live on YouTube.
    


            The Carruthers Geocorona Observatory is a small satellite that will be dedicated to observing the exosphere, or Earth's outermost atmospheric layer. The Carruthers mission will capture images of the region's faint ultraviolet glow, called the geocorona, to help answer questions about the exosphere's shape, size and density.
    


            The mission is named for Dr. George Carruthers, who developed an ultraviolet camera as the first moon-based observatory that was placed during the Apollo 16 mission. The camera, still in place in the Descartes highland region on the moon, photographed Earth in ultraviolet light and captured the first image of the exosphere in 1972.
    


            The Carruthers mission will measure changes and the effects of space weather once it reaches Earth, given that the exosphere marks a transitional boundary between Earth and space.
    


            Meanwhile, the SWFO-L1 mission is intended to act as a solar storm detector, providing early warnings to protect astronauts in low-Earth orbit and satellites that provide critical communications on Earth. It's a tool that will be even more necessary as astronauts venture farther into deep space.
    


            “I think we're getting better…but a really solid forecast, I think, is still something that we're striving for,” said Mark Clampin, acting deputy associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, at a news conference for the agency's upcoming Artemis II mission around the moon. “And obviously the missions that we're putting up now will give us much better insight into not just the one piece of the problem, but the whole problem, from what's happening on the sun to how that then propagates out from the sun, and whether it becomes a real problem or not.”
    


Two billionaires have very different — and equally wild — visions of a future in space. Is either possible?



            The satellite's compact coronagraph telescope will monitor the sun for activity and measure the solar wind, providing a constant stream of data to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. Images of solar storms taken by the satellite can be sent to the center within 30 minutes, while other current missions, like NASA and the European Space Agency's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, launched in 1995, can take up to eight hours.
    


            “SWFO-L1's essential data is our lifeline for keeping the lights on, planes flying and satellites safe, ensuring that America is ready for what the sun sends our way ,” said Clinton Wallace, director of NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center.

A new California law that bans federal immigration officers from wearing face masks in the state is unconstitutional and unenforceable, according to former law enforcement officials.

Over the weekend, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) signed five bills into law that aim at restraining the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement from arresting illegal immigrants across the West Coast state, a move that he said was meant to deter federal authorities from carrying out President Donald Trump's mass deportation operation.

Other laws included policies barring ICE from accessing schools and hospitals without a judicial warrant and requiring schools, colleges, and universities to alert parents when ICE is on campus.

One such law, SB 627, made it illegal for local police and sheriff's department employees, federal police, and state police from states other than California to wear face masks while working. California state police were exempt from the face mask ban.

The trouble for Newsom, according to several former police officials who spoke with the Washington Examiner on Tuesday, is that although the state could enforce this mask ban against its own local police and sheriff's deputies, it cannot dictate how federal police present themselves.

Jonathan Fahey, former acting ICE director, said going after federal police would violate the Constitution's Supremacy Clause because federal law is supreme.

“When a federal officer is acting within their official capacity and doing what they believe is … within the scope of their employment, they cannot be prosecuted, even if it in fact violated a state law,” said Fahey, now partner with the Holtzman Vogel law firm in Washington. “Everyone knows that [California] can't do this.”

Bill Johnson, executive director of a national police organization representing more than a quarter of a million officers, agreed with Fahey.

“It seems pretty clear from a constitutional perspective that any efforts by California to thwart federal law enforcement actions will fail under the federal constitution's Supremacy Clause,” said Johnson, who leads the National Association of Police Organizations. “No doubt the governor and his advisers are aware of this, but once again have chosen the cheap theatrics of another ill-advised state policy that will be quickly struck down.”

Brian R. Marvel, president of the Peace Officers Research Association of California, said the governor's plan would turn local police into a “punching bag to grandstand against the federal government” and said the organization's 83,000 officers opposed it.

Johnson added that the law “seems just like more of the same old song and dance” from California politicians.

“Instead of focusing on all the problems within California and failure after failure of their policies, the governor once again seeks to deflect attention by stoking anger against law-enforcement officers and agents,” Johnson said. “These proposals ignore the very real threats and attacks against law-enforcement officers and their families at all levels.”

Sgt. Betsy Brantner Smith, who spent nearly three decades at a large police department in the Chicago suburbs, said the California law was likely “ceremonial” and explained that face masks serve a purpose.

“We wear face coverings in certain situations to prevent us — the law enforcement officer — from being identified,” Smith said. “It could be, again, from the doxing. It can also be because those officers are working in some sort of undercover capacity, some sort of tactical capacity. For example, SWAT teams and tactical teams very often wear face coverings, again, to prevent them from being identified, not to be hiding from the public.”

ICE did not respond to a request for comment, but Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin stated, “We don't need to abide by this garbage.”

California police could run into their own legal trouble if they attempt to arrest ICE personnel when the ban takes effect on Jan. 1, 2026.

“If a state officer tried to arrest like an ICE agent for wearing a mask while they're out doing their job, the state officer would actually be arguably guilty of obstructing justice, and an ICE agent would be able to arrest the state officer who's trying to arrest them,” Fahey said.

A Department of Justice spokesperson would not comment on how the federal government would handle potential state enforcement of the mask ban, but did note in a statement sent Tuesday evening that “protecting the safety and security of our federal law enforcement officers, ridding our country of dangerous illegal aliens, will continue to be a top priority for this Administration.”

Newsom has led the Democratic effort to fight back against the Trump administration, accusing President Donald Trump of “authoritarian tendencies” and abusing his authority on numerous occasions. Fahey quipped that Newsom could be the one determined to be abusing power if he required California police to enforce the ICE mask ban.

“What could be more an abuse of power to sign a law that is clearly unconstitutional, which would give the states power that they don't have under the Constitution to enforce laws,” Fahey said. “So if they actually try to enact this, it's a complete abuse of power.”

Newsom's office did not respond to a request for comment.

NewsNation reached a major milestone on Sunday, outperforming CNN and MSNBC in total viewers and the key advertising demographic of adults aged 25-54 for six consecutive hours, the first time the network has achieved that feat, according to Nielsen data.

From 1 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. ET, the network averaged 615,000 viewers overall and 173,000 in the 25-54 demo. Coverage was anchored by Chief Washington Correspondent Leland Vittert and later by Nichole Berlie, who hosted a special edition of NewsNation Now. Programming included live coverage of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk's memorial service, followed by analysis and reaction.

The Sunday block marked NewsNation's highest-rated Sunday ever, far surpassing its normal averages. Viewership was up nearly 1,000% compared to the network's typical Sunday afternoon ratings. At its peak, around 3:57 p.m. ET, nearly 2 million people were watching, with 1.96 million total viewers recorded.

The surge gave NewsNation decisive wins over its competitors.

CNN averaged 342,000 viewers during the same period (54,000 in the demo), while MSNBC managed 287,000 viewers (31,000 demo).

The strong showing follows another victory the previous week, when NewsNation topped CNN and MSNBC in Saturday prime-time ratings. However, the six-hour stretch on Sunday was the first time the network has simultaneously outperformed both rivals for such a sustained duration in total viewership and the 25-54 demo.

While NewsNation celebrated a breakthrough, Fox News once again led cable news.

The network averaged 5.2 million viewers and 755,000 in the 25-54 demo during the same 1:30–7:15 p.m. ET window, according to Nielsen's Big Data Plus Panel. That accounted for nearly 90% of total cable news viewership. Fox's audience peaked during Erika Kirk's tribute at 6 p.m. ET hour, drawing 6.6 million total viewers and 1.1 million in the demo.

The memorial service ratings highlighted a shifting cable landscape: Fox News remains the undisputed leader, NewsNation is carving out new territory with record viewership, and CNN and MSNBC continue to slide further behind.

Microsoft is the lead investor in OpenAI and has long been the artificial intelligence startup's key cloud partner. But in the latest sign that AI relationships are getting complicated, Microsoft is beginning to use more technology from OpenAI rival Anthropic.

The software giant said Wednesday that it's starting to draw on an AI model from Anthropic to answer some queries in the Microsoft 365 Copilot assistant for commercial clients.

The effort represents another step toward diversification in generative AI for Microsoft, which has mainly relied on OpenAI models for artificial intelligence features in Bing, Windows and other products. As part of a strategic partnership, Microsoft has invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI, and OpenAI operates its models in the Azure cloud, among other places.

OpenAI has been busy expanding its roster of high-powered partners. In recent weeks, the company has disclosed that it plans to spend $300 billion with Oracle, and it's forged a $10 billion agreement with chip designer Broadcom. This week, chipmaker Nvidia said it will invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a joint effort to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on new data centers.

Microsoft and OpenAI remain close, but their arrangement is changing.

Last year, Microsoft said it was allowing software engineers to get coding help from Anthropic and Google models in the GitHub Copilot Chat assistant, and not just from OpenAI. Anthropic, founded in 2021 by former OpenAI executives, was recently valued by investors at $183 billion. Microsoft remains the exclusive cloud supplier for OpenAI's programming interface that third-party applications rely on.

Anthropic's model is coming first to Researcher, an agent for Microsoft 365 Copilot that can gather and analyze information and generate reports.

Employees at organizations enrolled in Microsoft's Frontier program, which provides early access to AI features, can now choose to use Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.1 reasoning model, a type of model that's designed to break down complex tasks, as an alternative to OpenAI's competitive offering in Researcher.

"And stay tuned: Anthropic models will bring even more powerful experiences to Microsoft 365 Copilot," Charles Lamanna, Microsoft's president of business and industry Copilot, wrote in a blog post.

Corporate users can now opt to tap Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Opus 4.1 when building their own AI agents with Microsoft's Copilot Studio tool.

Administrators must enable Anthropic models before employees can use them. The models run in the Amazon and Google clouds. Their use is subject to Anthropic's terms and conditions, Lamanna wrote.

In addition to incorporating large language models from more companies, Microsoft has started testing MAI-1-preview, which it built in-house.

"As AI becomes more capable and agentic, models themselves become more of a commodity," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in an October LinkedIn post.

Last year, Microsoft identified OpenAI and Anthropic as competitors in AI products.

The Information reported on Microsoft's Copilot plans with Anthropic earlier in September.

Copilot is key to Microsoft's AI strategy.

"It continues to be rolled out among enterprises in phases," analysts at KeyBanc wrote in a July note to clients. The analysts, who recommend holding the stock, wrote that based on an "industry check," about 60% of customers are "implementing Copilot for just 10% of their 365 user base," and just 4% roll it out for every user.

MUNICH — Xiaomi on Wednesday made the international debut of a slew of new devices and appliances with its smartphones at the center, as the Chinese tech giant sets out to directly challenge Samsung.

The Beijing-headquartered company took the wraps off of the Xiaomi 15T series comprising of two smartphones — the Xiaomi 15T and Xiaomi 15T Pro — during a launch event in Munich.

The devices, priced at 649 euros ($766) and 799 euros, respectively, continue Xiaomi's strategy of bringing phones with the latest specs to the market at a competitive price.

Xiaomi talked up the triple-camera system, large 6.83-inch display and big battery power, as it looks to position the devices as a potential contender to Samsung's mid-range A series and top-end S Series of smartphones.

For comparison, Samsung's S25 starts at 799 euros, while its top-end device, the S25 Ultra, starts at 1,249 euros in Germany.

"The 15T is basically an affordable flagship with high-end features but priced half a notch down from the top tier premium devices," Bryan Ma, vice president of devices research at International Data Corporation, told CNBC by email.

Over the past few years, Xiaomi has expanded its geographical footprint and offerings to include everything from washing machines to electric cars.

In Europe, Xiaomi has cemented itself as the third largest smartphone player by market share, behind Samsung and Apple, through a mix of high-end and mid-tier devices that have offered a stiff challenge to the two giants.

Xiaomi launched its more expensive Xiaomi 15 phones internationally earlier this year. In China, it is gearing up for the unveiling of its 17 series of devices, which will be its flagship.

"Xiaomi 15T is another important step for Xiaomi in its premiumization strategy, particularly trying to capture the slightly more budget-sensitive, spec-focused buyers that still opt for a high-end device, Runar Bjorhovde, analyst at Canalys said.

"One of Xiaomi's major strategic focuses in taking on the high-end."

But the company has bigger ambitions. On Wednesday, Xiaomi announced the global launch of it Mijia brand of  home appliances, which include a refrigerator, washing machine and air conditioner.

It's a move right out of Samsung's playbook. The South Korean technology giant sells products across the world spanning from appliances to smartphones and TVs.

"Xiaomi naturally puts the pressure on any competitor in the sectors that it enters given its operating model of aggressively priced yet good quality products," Ma said.

Lithium Americas stock doubled Wednesday as the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the mining company, which is based in Vancouver, British Columbia.

The White House proposed the equity stake as Lithium Americas renegotiates the terms of a $2.2 billion loan from the Department of Energy for its Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, a Trump administration official told CNBC. Reuters first reported the equity stake proposal.

Lithium Americas' shares hit a session high of $6.23, up more than 100% over Tuesday's close of $3.07. The miner has a market cap of about $1.5 billion.

It is the latest move by the White House to take direct ownership in the mineral supply chain critical to U.S. interests, but the first such stake proposed for a Canadian company. Lithium Americas trades on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NYSE but is incorporated and domiciled in Canada.

The Department of Defense took a 15% equity stake in rare earth miner MP Materials in July. Shares of Las Vegas-based MP Materials have more than doubled since the deal.

Thacker Pass in northern Nevada is expected to become one of the largest sources of lithium in North America with the first phase of the project scheduled to start operations in late 2027. The project is a joint venture between Lithium Americas and General Motors.

Lithium Americas has a 62% stake and operates the mine. GM has a 38% stake and has agreed to buy offtake from the mine when it is operational. Lithium is a critical material for electric vehicle batteries.

Lithium Americas and GM had to renegotiate the terms of the loan for Thacker Pass because they did not meet the conditions for the first disbursement, the Trump administration official said. During negotiations with the Department of Energy, they requested to push out part of the loan repayment into later years, the official said.

"If we're going to push out part of the repayment into later years, then the administration would like a very small stake of equity to create essentially a cash buffer and eliminate some risk on behalf of taxpayers," the official said.

A deal has not been finalized but the Trump administration supports the project and the discussions are positive, the official said. The investment could need Canadian approval as well given the company's jurisdiction.

Lithium Americas confirmed Wednesday that it is in talks with the Energy Department and GM on the loan for Thacker Pass. GM declined CNBC's request for comment.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum revealed in April that the Trump administration was considering taking equity stakes in miners to back them against state-sponsored competition in China.

A gunman opened fire at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Dallas on Wednesday morning, shooting multiple people and killing one before taking his own life, authorities said.

"We had four individuals that were shot, two of them deceased, including the shooter," Dallas Police Chief Daniel Comeaux said at a news conference.

Federal authorities said that the victims include ICE detainees.

No law enforcement members were hurt during the attack, said Joe Rothrock, special agent in charge of the Dallas FBI field office, at the conference.

Rothrock said that rounds of ammunition found near the suspected shooter "contain messages that are anti-ICE in nature."

FBI Director Kash Patel later wrote on X that an "initial review of the evidence shows an [ideological] motive behind this attack."

"One of the unspent shell casings recovered was engraved with the phrase 'ANTI ICE.' More updates will be forthcoming," Patel wrote in the post, which included a photo of the casings.

The attack is being investigated as "an act of targeted violence," Rothrock said at the presser. 

Rothrock said the shooting was just the latest example of violence targeting ICE in Texas, noting that there was a "coordinated attack" on an immigrant detention center in the state on July 4.

Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson thanked law enforcement who responded to the shooting, and called for people to come together in prayer for the nation.

"There's a lot going on right now in our country, a lot that's confusing," he said. "Please pray for everyone who's affected by today's tragedy."

Johnson, a Republican, called for patience while the active investigation into the shooting continues.

Multiple senior Trump administration officials quickly drew a link between the attack and what they characterized as extreme left-wing rhetoric against ICE. The agency has become a flashpoint of controversy during President Donald Trump's second term, as it carries out unprecedented operations to remove millions of undocumented immigrants from the U.S.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X later Wednesday, "These horrendous killings must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences."

Vice President JD Vance posted, "The obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop."

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote, "Democrats must stop demonizing the heroic men and women of ICE who are just doing their jobs to keep Americans safe."

For humans to pass the prestigious, three-part chartered financial analyst exam, it typically takes around 1,000 hours of studying over the course of several years. New research found that the technology underpinning a slew of artificial intelligence models is now advanced enough to pass even the most difficult – Level III – mock exams in a matter of minutes.

The new study – developed by researchers from New York University Stern School of Business and GoodFin, an AI-powered wealth management platform – evaluated 23 large language models on their ability to answer multiple choice and essay questions on mock CFA Level III exams. They found frontier reasoning models, including o4-mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude Opus, were able to use "chain-of-thought prompting" to successfully pass.

Previous research, particularly from two years ago, had found artificial intelligence could clear Levels I and II of the exam, but it struggled with Level III, due to the essay questions. However, the technology has evolved so rapidly that the researchers wanted to know whether the models could handle, "specialized, high-stakes analytical reasoning required for professional financial decision-making." The third CFA exam is primarily focused on portfolio management and wealth planning.

"I think there's absolutely a future where this technology transforms the industry," said Anna Joo Fee, founder and CEO of GoodFin, which contributed to – but did not pay for – the research.

Still, Fee said she does not think the AI will ultimately replace the CFA.

"There are things like context and intent that are hard for the machine to assess right now," Fee said. "That's where a human shines, in understanding your body language and cues."

It's been a chaotic few days for the tech sector, and industry executives and experts are still assessing how U.S. President Donald Trump's latest immigration crackdown could shape the future of their workforces. 

The Trump administration sparked widespread panic Friday after announcing employers will pay a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas, which are temporary work visas granted to highly skilled foreign professionals. These visas have underpinned the U.S. tech workforce for decades.

Some tech executives, including Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have lauded the changes to the H-1B program, but experts told CNBC that the Trump administration's changes could prevent some tech companies — namely startups — from securing top foreign talent. These experts said the changes also run the risk of driving top talent toward other countries.

"The short of it is, it would be a disaster for America, for American companies, American competitiveness, American innovation," said Exequiel Hernandez, an associate professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

The current annual cap for H-1B visas is at 65,000, along with 20,000 additional visas for foreign professionals with advanced degrees.

In fiscal 2025, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Google are among the top 10 companies that employ the most H-1B holders. Prominent tech executives like Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla CEO Elon Musk were H-1B recipients earlier in their careers.

As tech companies scrambled to respond before Trump's proclamation went into effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on Sunday, the White House quelled some concerns on Saturday by clarifying that the fee is not annual and would only apply to new visas, not renewals for current visa holders.

More changes could be on the horizon. 

The Trump administration teased a proposed rule on Tuesday that said H-1B recipients should be selected through a weighted process instead of a random one. The weighted process would take place when the number of requests for visas exceeds the limit of available spots, and it would be based on wage levels, the proposal said.

The proposed rule will officially publish in the Federal Register on Wednesday, and it's still subject to change after the administration reviews initial public feedback.

Hastings called the Trump administration's $100,000 fee a "great solution," in a post on X on Sunday.

"It will mean H1-B is used just for very high value jobs, which will mean no lottery needed, and more certainty for those jobs," he wrote.

OpenAI's Altman expressed support for the updates during an interview with CNBC's Jon Fortt on Monday.

"We need to get the smartest people in the country, and streamlining that process and also sort of outlining financial incentives seems good to me," Altman said.

Historically, H-1B visas have cost employers somewhere between $2,000 to $5,000 per application, depending on the size of the company, according to the Immigration Law Group. 

The new $100,000 fee is a big jump for small, cash-strapped startups.

"You're not going to find many startups who are going to be willing to pay $100,000 per H-1B, in addition to salary for that H-1B," said Adam Kovacevich, CEO of Chamber of Progress, a left-leaning tech industry trade association.

Even big tech companies could feel some pain and have to reassess who they use H-1Bs for. But their deep pockets come with advantages. 

"A big firm like Microsoft or Google, even though it's not ideal for them, they have workarounds," said Wharton's Hernandez. "They can offshore jobs, or they're the ones who can make acquisitions."

Garry Tan, the CEO of the popular startup accelerator Y Combinator, criticized the Trump administration's new fee, writing in a LinkedIn post that "it kneecaps startups" and is a "massive gift" to overseas tech hubs.

"In the middle of an AI arms race, we're telling builders to build elsewhere," Tan wrote. "We need American Little Tech to win—not $100K toll booths."

U.S. tech companies big and small are fiercely competing with one another – and the rest of the world – as they race to develop the most advanced AI models and applications. Organizations like Meta have shelled out billions of dollars to recruit top AI talent in an effort to try and gain an edge.  

The Trump administration's changes to the H-1B program could complicate similar recruiting efforts. 

"What this does is that it gives our competitors, other countries, places like Asia, Canada, Europe, they can then attract these employees to create new innovations," said Steven Hubbard, a data scientist at the American Immigration Council, which is a nonprofit for immigration advocacy and research. 

One big competitor in the war for talent is China. The world's second-largest economy has long fought against the U.S. for tech dominance, and more recently the AI race.

Earlier this year, Chinese AI firm DeepSeek rattled global markets after claiming to create a large language chatbot that outperformed competitors at a fraction of the cost. The news raised questions over the significant sums that American tech companies are shelling out on AI.

Some experts worry that visa changes could deal a victory into China's hands, sending top talent overseas. The move may also deter foreign students from attending university in the U.S. as uncertainty hangs over their post-graduation job prospects.

"Those students are going to look at this environment and stay home," said Greg Morrisett, vice provost at Cornell Tech. "It's giving a leg up to both China and India in terms of feeding their startup ecosystems."

For Bradley Tusk, the CEO of Tusk Venture Partners, the changes to the H-1B program are simply "terrible." American companies have to have access to top talent in order to compete at the highest levels, he said.  

"America's competitive advantage has always been the ability to attract the best talent from around the world," Tusk said. "To limit our ability to recruit and compete is illogical."

Global defense stocks moved higher on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump, in a major rhetorical shift, said Ukraine could retake territory currently occupied by Russia.

In a post published overnight on his Truth Social platform, Trump said that Kyiv, with the support of the European Union and the NATO military coalition, "is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form."

The EU and NATO have offered military and humanitarian support to Ukraine — which is not currently a member of either organization — since the start of Russia's invasion in 2022.

Trump said his view came after "getting to know and fully understand" Russia and Ukraine's military and economic situation, noting what he described as the "economic trouble" that the conflict is causing in Moscow. The White House leader also likened Russia to a "paper tiger" — a term that typically refers to a force that appears powerful, but is in truth ineffective.

The U.S. president has previously suggested Ukraine would need to be open to giving up some of its territory in peace talks, which Washington has taken steps to broker since the start of Trump's second mandate.

In separate comments on Tuesday, Trump said NATO members should shoot down Russian jets entering its airspace, following a series of reported incursions in the Polish, Romanian and Estonian skies by Russian aircraft and drones in recent weeks.

Defense stocks were among the top performers on the pan-European Stoxx 600 index on Wednesday afternoon.

German tank parts maker Renk was last seen trading around 6.5% higher, while Italian defense firm Leonardo and Swedish defense giant Saab both rose more than 3.5%.

German defense firm Hensoldt was another top performer, up 5.8% at 3:30 p.m. London time.

Hensoldt Chief Financial Officer Christian Ladurner said Trump's comments don't necessarily change the overall situation for Europe's defense industry, but that they rather reaffirm the sector's warnings that Russian President Vladmir Putin will continue to test the bloc.

"I think, in general, we have to say that the developments we have seen in the last two days are very encouraging for Europe," Ladurner told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Wednesday.

"We see that the U.S. is more and more, I would say, seeing the reality, what is really happening and what has happened. So, this is encouraging for us," he added.

In Asia, major South Korean defense stocks — including Hanwha Aerospace, Korea Aerospace and Hyundai Rotem — all posted gains of between 2% and 5% on Wednesday.

Stateside, U.S. defense stocks were also higher. Lockheed Martin, RTX and Northrop Grumman all traded more than 1% higher, while Boeing was up around 0.3%.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed Trump's Truth Social post, saying on social media that he was "grateful" for the U.S. president's "strong cooperation."

Trump "clearly understands the situation and is well-informed about all aspects of this war. We highly value his resolve to help end this war," Zelenskyy said on social media platform X on Tuesday evening.

Russia — which has improved rapprochement with Washington in recent months — also responded to Trump's tonal shift on the Ukraine war.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday said Putin "highly values Trump's willingness to help" find solutions on Ukraine. Peskov disputed Trump's labelling of Russia as a so-called "paper tiger," however.

Amazon's AI coding assistant Q Developer saw revenue fall behind rivals in its first year, prompting the company to reassess its broader branding plans, Business Insider has learned.

As of late April, a full year since its launch, Q Developer's projected annual recurring revenue was $16.3 million, according to an internal document obtained by BI. The forecast was based on roughly $317,000 in weekly revenue and $1.25 million over the trailing 4-week period.

ARR is a common industry metric that extrapolates weekly or monthly revenue streams into an annualized figure.

Q Developer's growth might have stood out in earlier years, but it looks modest in today's rapidly accelerating AI industry, according to Jason Lemkin, managing director of SaaStr Fund.

For instance, Anysphere's Cursor coding tool crossed $500 million in ARR in June after reaching $100 million earlier this year. Another popular AI coding assistant Windsurf reported $82 million in ARR in July, less than a year into its launch. Even younger AI startups like Gamma and Higgsfield hit $50 million in ARR in less than a year, underscoring Q Developer's comparatively slower growth, Lemkin said.

"It's not as jaw-dropping as it used to be," Lemkin told BI, referring to Q Developer's growth. "AWS has fallen behind in the AI race."

An Amazon spokesperson wrote in an email that it is "continuing to innovate rapidly" to grow Q, with firms including ADP, Deloitte, and Japan Research Institute among active users.

"We're extremely pleased with the accelerating growth of Amazon Q, where daily usage of Q Developer has increased 9-fold per person this year," the spokesperson added.

Q is a key AI product category for Amazon, akin to Microsoft's Copilot. Q Developer is a AI coding assistant for developers, while Q Business is an AI chatbot targeting general business users.

But Q has yet to gain widespread recognition, and Amazon is now looking to refine the Q branding, according to several Amazon employees who spoke to BI. These people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.

Q Business is also undergoing a major revamp with the forthcoming Quick Suite, BI previously reported.

Several Amazon employees told BI that AWS lacks a strong reputation for AI-powered developer tools. They said generative AI took AWS by surprise, leading the company to rush new products without comprehensive feature sets.

Amazon's spokesperson told BI that Q Developer continues to receive positive feedback from customers, and it is the most widely used internal tool at the company.

"We are seeing more and more customers, from startups to large enterprises, adopt Q Developer to make their teams more productive," the spokesperson said.

For Amazon, the AI coding market is too big to walk away from. Gartner projects that by 2028, 40% of new business software will be built with such tools.

Yet even inside Amazon, employees appear to favor external products like Cursor over Q Developer.

Internal Slack messages reviewed by BI earlier this year showed that Amazon was planning to deploy Cursor internally after strong employee demand. In one message, an employee wrote that Cursor can make "almost instantaneous" changes, while Q Developer takes "minutes."

Even Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has taken note. He previously said Q Developer saved Amazon "4,500 developer years of work" and an estimated $260 million in "annualized efficiency gains." On May's earnings call, however, he pointed to Cursor, an AWS cloud customer, as a major force behind the "explosion of coding agents."

Business Insider Edition 

Eswatini recently disclosed that it had repatriated a Jamaican native who had been sent to the Southern African country from the United States under the Donald Trump third-country immigration policy.


        In July, the U.S deported five third-country nationals to Eswatini as part of its campaign against illegal immigration.
    


        Orville Isaac Etoria, a Jamaican who was part of the group, has now been sent back to his home country, according to a statement by the Eswatini government.

        The statement added that Mr. Etoria, 62, was "warmly welcomed by members of his family" following his voluntary repatriation over the course of the weekend.
    


        "Mr Etoria has safely returned to Jamaica, where he was warmly welcomed by members of his family," said the Eswatini government statement issued on Monday.
    


        The Legal Aid Society of New York, however, has reproved his treatment, claiming that Etoria entered the US as a minor and maintained legitimate permanent residency status there for many years.
    


        The rest of the deportees to the small Southern African country, originally from Cuba, Laos, Vietnam, and Yemen, are still being held there.
    


        As seen on the BBC, these men are being detained in solitary confinement in a maximum security prison in the capital city, Mbabane, after being described as ‘depraved monsters' by the U.S government.
    


        Originally, the country stated that the deportees were being kept in separate jail facilities pending repatriation procedures.
    


        The legal representatives for the four deportees still in Eswatini claim they have been unable to get in touch with them.
    


        But Eswatini disclosed that it is working to repatriate them all.
    


        In July, a deportation flight carrying immigrants from Yemen, Cuba, Laos, Vietnam, and Jamaica landed in Eswatini.
    


        The flight had been authorized by the US Department of Homeland Security under the revised regulation that allows illegal migrants to be deported to countries other than their home of origin.

        The Trump administration was able to continue deporting migrants without providing them an opportunity to prove that they were being persecuted or injured because of a June ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court.
    


        U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin described five of the deported individuals as "depraved monsters" in a tweet on X.

European shares ended the day slightly lower on Wednesday, although defense stocks received a boost from U.S. President Donald Trump's latest comments on the conflict in Ukraine.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 provisionally ended the day down 0.14%, paring some losses from earlier in the session.

Defense stocks were among the top performers, with the Stoxx Europe Aerospace and Defense Index gaining around 1.3%.

Germany's Renk and Hensoldt both added around 8%, and Sweden's Saab gained almost 5.5%.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said Ukraine could recoup all of its territory from Russia in a major shift in stance.

"I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form," the president said in a post on his Truth Social platform.

"With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option," he added.

Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Tuesday, when he also expressed support for NATO members shooting down any Russian aircraft that breaches their airspace.

It comes after global markets were rattled by comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday. 

He said asset prices, including equities, were trading at inflated levels.

"By many measures, for example, equity prices are fairly highly valued," he said, when asked about the central bank's tolerance levels for market prices.

Overnight in Asia, shares broadly moved lower, while U.S. stocks were mixed.

Monday - Friday, 10:00 - 11:00 SIN/HK  |  0400 - 05:00 CET

This report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. You can subscribe here.

Many in business circles were hoping for a sweeping U.S.-China trade deal, but an agreement now looks even more elusive.

The fate of TikTok in the U.S. overshadowed the latest round of trade talks, to the point that it's now unclear whether both sides are on the same page about what the app's divestiture from Beijing-based parent ByteDance should look like.

Meanwhile, on issues like tariffs, fentanyl and semiconductors, even less has been said by either side.

The distance is already visible. China has been silent on future meetings, even as U.S. President Donald Trump announced he and Chinese President Xi Jinping "agreed" to meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea next month.

The lack of details in the Chinese side's statement "suggests that China is taking time to negotiate when U.S. is keen to have deals," said Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU School of Law, pointing out that Beijing "said nothing about [an] APEC meeting."

And then there's China's vague commitments to a tech licensing deal to keep TikTok alive in the U.S. — what Beijing calls a "solution that complies with China's laws and regulations."

That contrasts with the constant flow of details from the U.S., now covering everything from investors to board seats. A Politico report, citing an unnamed senior White House official, even claimed that the Trump administration is "100% confident" of a deal forcing Beijing-based ByteDance to spin off TikTok's U.S. operations.

Trump, however, may have preempted China's coolness, saying in a Truth Social post Friday that he "appreciate[s] the TikTok approval" after his call with Xi, even as Beijing kept its language vague.

China, meanwhile, has paired that coolness with a media blitz around its latest talks with the U.S. in Madrid, aiming to project confidence as a tech power following a showcase of new weapons at the Sept. 3 military parade.

Context is everything

In the runup to the Madrid talks held earlier this month, Beijing announced new probes into U.S. chips — and, as the negotiations wrapped up on Monday, called out Nvidia for alleged monopolistic practices. The next evening, the official evening news broadcast — closely watched by officials and anyone trying to read the tea leaves on Beijing — included a segment highlighting China's own semiconductors.

A day before the Trump-Xi call, Chinese tech giant Huawei also claimed its upcoming chip cluster would be more powerful than Nvidia's.

All these news items may appear to be separate events. But in China, where ceremonial timing matters, little happens in a vacuum — any action from a parade to chosen silence is calculated, often tapping into a political context that may appear unrelated to outsiders.

Notably, the latest debate over TikTok coincided with China's national cybersecurity week, held on Sept 15-21. In past years, the event has served as a platform for Beijing to promote its national security agenda.

"Honestly, I really don't see why the Chinese side would have any interest at all in divesting the ... U.S. TikTok," said Blueshirt Group Managing Director Gary Dvorchak, whose work on Chinese listings in the U.S. has taken him between both countries.

"What's their gain from it? They're losing control of one of the crown jewels of China's technology," he said, pointing out that the U.S. would disagree if China wanted America to sell part of Google or Facebook. "So why would they do something that we would never do?"

Despite the standoff over TikTok, China hosted a bipartisan delegation of U.S. House Representatives this week, who arrived the weekend after the latest Trump-Xi phone call. It was the first such visit since 2019.

U.S. representative Adam Smith, who led the trip, told reporters Tuesday that in meetings with Chinese leaders, the two sides discussed TikTok as an issue to be resolved, but did not get into technical details.

"I think there's going to be a lot of maybe positive noises" about TikTok, Dvorchak said, "but then in the end, at the last minute, it's always going to fall apart."

That said, the TikTok battle has become part of a larger game of political theatre. Beijing never confirmed Trump's announcement early last week that he would speak with Xi — until state media announced on Friday that the two leaders were speaking.

But the more elaborate the posturing by both sides, the more difficult it is to achieve a deal with optics that satisfies both sides.

Bill Bishop of Sinocism compared the new U.S. H-1B visa rules with China's K-Visa and the implications for the two countries.

Shen Jianguang, Vice President & Chief Economist at Chinese tech giant JD.Com, evaluated China's position in global trade as the economy remains sluggish.

Ahead of the Trump-Xi phone call, Duncan Clark, Chairman of BDA China and author of "Alibaba: The House that Jack Ma Built", suggested that the U.S. cannot afford to overplay its hand as China currently has the advantage.

Apple iPhone 17 sees demand rise. The U.S. smartphone giant could be poised for a comeback, as a few buyers in Beijing told CNBC that more locals are giving the iPhone a try this year due to its upgraded features. But the highly anticipated iPhone Air isn't coming to China yet due to its eSIM design.

Chinese nationals hit with fresh U.S. visa uncertainty. After the Trump administration said that it would ask companies to pay $100,000 for new H-1B visa applicants, many Chinese shared their frustration on social media. China was the second-largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 11.7% of approved visa holders, according to U.S. homeland security data.

ByteDance valuation hopes climb. Investor conviction in the Chinese tech giant has climbed since Washington and Beijing this week reached a framework agreement on the long-contested future of TikTok in the U.S., several dealmakers told CNBC. The latest valuation? $400 billion.

Investors are realizing, 'I was told China is uninvestable, and Alibaba has gone up 100%. It's one of the biggest companies in the world. Maybe I should be looking back at that.'

— Mark Tinker, CIO of Toscafund Hong Kong

Mainland China and Hong Kong stocks were higher, bucking overall declines in Asia after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that "equity prices are fairly highly valued."

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and mainland China's CSI 300 were up 1% and 0.88% respectively. Super Typhoon Ragasa brought hurricane-force winds to high grounds and southern areas in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory noted. Conditions remain severe, with heavy showers and thunderstorms expected.

Shares of Alibaba listed in Hong Kong jumped over 6% after CEO Eddie Wu said Wednesday that the company will boost its investment in artificial intelligence.

ABILENE, Texas — Sam Altman stood on a patch of hot Texas dirt, the kind that turns to dust storms on dry days and mud slicks after a sudden rain. Behind him stretched the outlines of what will soon be a massive data center complex in the west-central part of the state, where heavy wind often meets extreme heat.

It was a fitting backdrop for the OpenAI CEO to unveil what he calls the largest infrastructure push of the modern internet era: a 17-gigawatt buildout in partnership with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank.

In less than 48 hours, OpenAI has announced commitments equal to 17 nuclear plants or about nine Hoover Dams. The plan will require the amount of electricity needed to power more than 13 million U.S. homes.

The scale is staggering, even for a company that's raised a record amount of private market cash and seen its valuation swell to $500 billion. At roughly $50 billion per site, OpenAI's projects add up to about $850 billion in spending, nearly half of the $2 trillion global AI infrastructure surge HSBC now forecasts.

Altman understands the concern. But he rejects the idea that the spending spree is overkill.

"People are worried. I totally get that. I think that's a very natural thing," Altman told CNBC on Tuesday from the site of the first of its mega data centers in Abilene. "We are growing faster than any business I've ever heard of before."

Altman insisted that the building boom is in response to soaring demand, highlighting the tenfold jump in ChatGPT usage over the past 18 months. He said a network of supercomputing facilities is what's required to maximize the capabilities of AI.

"This is what it takes to deliver AI," Altman said. "Unlike previous technological revolutions or previous versions of the internet, there's so much infrastructure that's required, and this is a small sample of it."

The biggest bottleneck for AI isn't money or chips — it's electricity. Altman has put money into nuclear companies because he sees their steady, concentrated output as one of the only energy sources strong enough to meet AI's enormous demand.

Altman led a $500 million funding round into fusion firm Helion Energy to build a demonstration reactor, and backed Oklo, a fission company he took public last year through his own SPAC. 

Critics warn of a bubble, pointing to how companies like Nvidia, Oracle, Broadcom and Microsoft have each added hundreds of billions of dollars in market value on the back of tie-ups with OpenAI, which is burning cash. Nvidia and Microsoft are now worth a combined $8.1 trillion, or equal to about 13.5% of the S&P 500.

Skeptics also say the system looks like a circular financing model. OpenAI is committing hundreds of billions of dollars to projects that rely on partners like Nvidia, Oracle, and SoftBank. Those companies are simultaneously investing in the same projects and then getting paid back through chip sales and data center leases.

Friar has a different perspective, arguing that the entire ecosystem is banding together to meet a historic surge in compute needs. Big tech booms, Friar noted, have always required this kind of bold, coordinated infrastructure buildout.

Altman added that such cycles of overinvesting and underinvesting have marked every past technological revolution. Some people, he said, will surely feel the pain.

"People will get burned on overinvesting and people also get burned on underinvesting and not having enough capacity," he said. "Smart people will get overexcited, and people will lose a lot of money. People will make a lot of money. But I am confident that long term, the value of this technology is going to be gigantic to society."

OpenAI's partners are betting big on that future. Oracle is even reshaping its leadership around it. On Monday, the company promoted Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia to CEO roles, replacing Safra Catz. Magouyrk ran cloud infrastructure and Sicilia was president of Oracle Industries.

"When you think about why make a transition now, it's really around Oracle's being set up for success," Magouyrk told CNBC. "I only see more and more demand from the end users … what looks like near infinite demand for technology."

Nvidia is fronting equity alongside its chips, including the new Vera Rubin accelerators meant to power the next wave of AI workloads. The Abilene facility is being leased by Oracle.

"Folks like Oracle are putting their balance sheets to work to create these incredible data centers you see behind us," OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar said in an interview on site.

She explained that OpenAI will pay operating expenses for the data centers when they're online, while Nvidia's investments are getting the project up and running.

"But importantly, they will get paid for all those chips as those chips get deployed," Friar said, referring to the arrangement with Nvidia.

Friar, who previously helped take Block public as CFO and then guided Nextdoor to the public market as CEO, pointed to the balancing act between equity, debt and operating expenses. She said that the facilities breaking ground now are aimed at bringing new capacity online next year.

"But then it's about what gets built for 2027, 2028, and 2029," she said. "What we see today is a massive compute crunch. There's not enough compute to do all the things that AI can do, and so we need to get it started — and we need to do it as a full ecosystem."

As for OpenAI's long-term relationship with Microsoft, "They're a major partner," Friar said, adding that the company will continue to be a key supplier of compute capacity.

She hinted that more developments are on the way with Microsoft, and that she's "pleased that we are where we are, but not fully ready to announce everything yet."

In Friar's current role, the numbers are much bigger than they ever were at the two companies she took public. Eventually OpenAI investors will expect returns on their hefty investments, but Altman said that the question of an IPO is "complicated."

"I assume that someday we will be a public company," he told CNBC. "I have mixed feelings about it … for now, we're certainly able to raise a lot of capital in private markets."

He said that being public could make long-term investments harder, given the need to meet Wall Street's expectations on a quarterly basis. But it would open up access to a broader base of investors, he said.

"I think that the world should, if people want to, own shares in OpenAI. I think that's awesome, and I want that to happen," Altman said.

In the near term, the story is about many billions of dollars plowed into chips and data centers in places like Abilene, and eventually in New Mexico, Ohio and elsewhere.

But OpenAI isn't just about infrastructure. In May, the company made the stunning announcement that it had acquired Jony Ive's nascent devices startup for about $6.4 billion. Bringing in the designer of the iPhone and the rest of Apple's most popular products wasn't an accident.

While in Texas, Altman hinted at hardware that could reshape how people use computers in their everyday lives.

The OpenAI CEO said computers have never before been able to truly "understand and think," and that breakthrough creates the chance to invent an entirely new way of using them.

He cautioned that it will take time before OpenAI has anything ready to ship. Even when it gets there, the company plans to release only a "small family of devices," he said. But the potential, Altman said, is "something big" and worth pursuing.

Alibaba shares soared in Hong Kong and U.S. premarket trading on Wednesday after the company said it will invest more in artificial intelligence and rolled out new AI products and updates. 

The tech giant's Hong Kong-listed shares jumped over 6%, to reach their highest point since 2021. Total gains over the year-to-date topped 107%. 

In the U.S., shares were 9.3% higher in premarket trade at 4.21 a.m. ET. 

Alibaba plans to increase spending on AI models and infrastructure development, on top of the 380 billion yuan ($53 billion) over three years it announced in February, Chief Executive Officer Eddie Wu said Wednesday at Alibaba Cloud's annual flagship technology conference.

"We are vigorously advancing a three-year, 380 billion [yuan] AI infrastructure initiative with plans to sustain and further increase our investment according to our strategic vision in anticipation of the [artificial superintelligence] era," Wu said. 

So-called "artificial superintelligence" refers to AI that would hypothetically surpass the power and intelligence of the human brain, with the hypothetical benchmark becoming a growing focus of major AI companies. 

Alibaba also officially unveiled the latest version of its Qwen large language models — the Qwen3-Max — on Wednesday, along with a series of other updates to its suite of AI product offerings. 

Wu highlighted that Alibaba Cloud is strategically positioned as a "full-stack AI service provider," delivering the computing power required for training and deploying large AI models on the cloud through its own data centers.

"The cumulative investment in global AI in the next five years will exceed $4 trillion, and this is the largest investment in computing power and research and development in history," he added.

Alibaba Cloud will also launch its first data centres in Brazil, France, and the Netherlands, the company said at the conference, and add more data centres in Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Dubai next year.

Last month, the company secured a deal with Unicom, a Chinese e-commerce giant, which will deploy Alibaba's AI accelerators from its semiconductor unit. Chinese tech firms have been focusing on securing chip self-sufficiency as tensions grow between the U.S. and China.

Business leaders such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Netflix chairman Reed Hastings have been weighing in on President Donald Trump's new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas.

The US issues roughly 85,000 new H-1B visas via a lottery system every year. The H-1B program is highly popular among US companies looking to hire foreign workers for in-demand roles such as tech and engineering.

On Friday, Trump signed an executive order raising the H-1B visa application fee by $100,000. The White House told Business Insider that the fee would only apply to new applicants, not those renewing their H-1B visas.

The sudden move has sparked concerns among Big Tech firms like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, whose workers are on H-1B visas. All three companies told their employees on the visa not to leave the US or to quickly return to the country if they were overseas.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed optimism about Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee during an interview with CNBC on Monday.

"We want all the brightest minds to come to the US, and remember immigration is the foundation of the American dream. And we represent the American dream," Huang said in a joint interview with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

The pair announced on Monday that Nvidia was making a $100 billion investment in OpenAI.

"Immigration is really important to our company and is really important to our nation's future, and I'm glad to see President Trump making the moves he's making," Huang added.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the Trump administration's introduction of a $100,000 fee to the H-1B visa program was the right move.

"We need to get the smartest people in the country, and streamlining that process and also sort of aligning financial incentives seems good to me," Altman told CNBC during his joint interview with Jensen Huang on Monday.

Netflix cofounder and chairman Reed Hastings praised Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee, calling it a "great solution" compared to the existing lottery system.

Hastings said in an X post on Sunday that he has "worked on H-1B politics for 30 years."

"It will mean H1-B is used just for very high-value jobs, which will mean no lottery needed, and more certainty for those jobs," he wrote.

"Shark Tank" star Kevin O'Leary said the $100,000 fee on H-1B visas would hurt American companies and limit their access to talent.

"Apple, Oracle, Google all started in a garage. They could have not afforded to do this. And all of those companies took advantage of talent they couldn't find in the United States as they grew," O'Leary told Fox Business's "Varney & Co." on Monday.

"I think what this does is hurt innovation long-term. I agree that it's going to push these really talented people into other countries," he added.

O'Leary said that the US government should, in fact, be paying foreign graduates to stay and work in the US.

"Why train them and kick them out? And if they're available, let's take them all and not charge a 100 grand. We should give them a 100 grand to come here," he said.

Ark Invest's Cathie Wood said Trump's new H-1B visa fee could be a part of his administration's negotiation strategy with India.

In August, Trump raised US tariffs on Indian goods to 50% from 25%. He wrote in a Truth Social post on August 4 that this was because India was not only "buying massive amounts of Russian Oil" but also "selling it on the Open Market for big profits."

The US and India are in the middle of trade negotiations. More than 70% of all H-1B visa holders come from India.

"It's a negotiation with India. Longer term, I think President Trump and his team want to keep as much innovation, talent, and technology talent as possible in the US," Wood said in an interview with Bloomberg on Monday.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the executive order was a rule change that "caught everyone off guard."

In an interview with CNBC this week, Dimon said he supports "merit-based immigration " and expects employers who rely on the program to object to the president's executive order.

"I would beg the president," he said. "He has accomplished border control, that's great, I mean, I think all nations want real border control, that helps make a nation, but after that, we should have good immigration," he said.

A Business Insider analysis earlier this year showed that JPMorgan is a top user of H-1B visas. It ranked first on a list of financial companies that use them.

Royal Bank of Canada's CEO Dave McKay said the US President's move to impose a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas is a win for Canada.

In an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, McKay called the rule a "material opportunity" for Canada to attract more skilled tech workers. He said the country should capitalize on it to accelerate growth in its innovation sector.

"So from India or from South Asia or from Europe, they'll say, 'Well, I can't get into the US, but I want to move to North America — I'll come to Canada,'" McKay said.

The RBC chief added that the Canadian government could lower taxes to make it more attractive to launch and grow businesses.

CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said that his company, like other tech firms, depends on talented individuals to help "build and drive" technology forward.

"Anytime you add an additional fee to it, it does serve as sand in the gears," Intrator said in an appearance on CNBC on Monday.

"Some sand in the gears is acceptable. It is going to be the competitive landscape and we will comply with it," he said. "But it does decelerate access to certain talents."

The Hyptec HT is hard to miss, especially the one I tested in a bright shade of orange.

Over three days behind the wheel in Singapore, the car drew plenty of attention. People stopped to ask what it was, and a few even asked to snap a photo.

Like many new Chinese EVs, the Hyptec HT isn't available in the US. It's made by Guangzhou Automobile Group, or GAC, one of China's largest carmakers.

Hyptec, short for "hyper" and "technology," is part of GAC's Aion brand and represents its bid to tap the booming premium EV market. With the HT, that push is aimed squarely at Tesla's Model Y and BYD's Sealion 7.

The company makes no secret of who it's going up against.

"We are targeting Sealion 7 and Model Y customers, and not creating a new market niche," Bender Guo, GAC's country manager for Singapore and Vietnam, told Business Insider.

The HT's silhouette struck me as very similar to Tesla's Model Y. Interestingly, it was designed at GAC's Advanced Design Studio in Los Angeles, just 15 miles from Tesla's design hub in Hawthorne — though there's no evidence the proximity influenced the design.

The HT wears sharp character lines, a coupe-like roofline, and flush door handles, giving it a futuristic look that blends sporty and premium.

One of the Hyptec HT's boldest design choices is its gullwing rear doors, a touch of "Back to the Future" made modern. Hyptec says they need a little over a foot of clearance, with 12 radar sensors to stop them clipping walls or ceilings.

They felt seamless in use: Press a button, and the doors glide up, making entry and exit easier than expected.

Still, the doors aren't perfect. Testing the car with two young kids in tow, they didn't feel entirely safe. At one point, a closing door required us to move a child's head out of the way — the sensors didn't seem ready to intervene. That said, there is the option for a standard door. The car is also available in less attention-grabbing colors.

For drivers interested in turning more heads, the HT features a choreographed audio-visual "light show" for onlookers — a party trick Tesla fans will recognize.

When I stepped in, the HT felt spacious and comfortable. The cabin leaned into luxury with orange Napa leather and an impressive finish front and back. Large windows and a skylight built into the gullwing doors filled the space with light. With its 2,935 mm wheelbase — the longest in its class — the back seat felt roomy enough for three adults, though taller passengers may want to avoid the middle seat, where the ceiling dips a bit lower.

Rear passengers also get a few indulgences I tested myself: seatbacks that recline to 143 degrees, a fold-out footrest on the left, and a tray table on the right that wouldn't look out of place in a Rolls-Royce.

Up front, I tried the ventilated seats and the 10-point massage system, which offers five modes. I could even choose which part of my back deserved a little extra love.

As expected these days, everything is controlled through a central screen. The car has a 14.6-inch display that handles climate, driving modes, and safety systems. It looks sleek, but adjusting basics like air conditioning required digging into menus. I also found disabling the safety assistance both difficult and annoying.

The cockpit itself was a pleasant place. The steering wheel reminded me of an Aston Martin DBX, and visibility was good all around. Seat comfort was excellent too, making it a car I felt I could drive for hours without fatigue. There was also plenty of storage space.

That said, a couple of details could use fine-tuning. The central air vent never seemed to hit the right angle, and the wireless phone charger was inconsistent, often cutting off mid-charge. I ended up plugging in a cable instead.

Out on the highway, the HT was impressively smooth and quiet. Even at three-figure speeds, wind and road noise are barely noticeable, leaving the cabin cocoon-like. GAC claims a WLTP range of 323 miles, which should be more than enough to get from Los Angeles to Las Vegas on a single charge.

It's a large car, so testing it like a performance sedan didn't make sense. Even so, it was very quick, especially in sport mode, as most EVs are. When a bend tightened more than expected, the HT stayed composed, with the steering delivering a reassuringly precise response.

In China, the top-spec Hyptec HT is priced at 285,900 yuan, or $40,100, slightly above the Tesla Model Y's 263,500 yuan price tag. That puts it squarely in premium-EV territory, but it has the features to back it up — especially those gullwing doors and limousine-like rear seats.

The car was first released in China in 2023 and later launched in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Thailand. GAC is set to expand into Europe next.

With a Brazilian factory slated to open in 2026, the company is signaling its intent to be a frontrunner in the global EV race.

 Bitcoin's bullish divergences on the RSI metric, along with record-low volatility, were early signs that the rally to $113,900 was in the making. Is the sell-off over? 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin bounced to $113,900 after testing weekly lows, fueled by bullish divergences.

Whale-sized entities have sold 147,000 BTC since August, signaling supply pressure.

Bitcoin options implied volatility hit multi-year lows, hinting at a potential explosive move.

Bitcoin (BTC) staged a swift recovery to $113,900 on Wednesday after sweeping below Monday's low of $111,500 and briefly testing the $111,000 mark on Binance during the Asia trading session. The bounce signaled an early attempt at mid-week recovery, supported by emerging bullish signals on the charts.

One of the key drivers behind the rebound is the bullish divergence between the relative strength index (RSI) and the BTC price on the one-hour and four-hour charts. A bullish divergence occurs when the price registers lower lows while the RSI forms higher lows, often indicating a waning bearish momentum and potential for a reversal.

The recovery also coincided with Bitcoin retesting its daily order block, providing a technical base for a possible push toward $115,000. Still, stronger confirmation is needed. 

A four-hour candle close above $113,400 would signal a clear shift from bearish to bullish structure. Additionally, reclaiming the 200-period exponential moving average (EMA) on the four-hour chart would reinforce positive momentum. 

Crypto traders offered mixed reactions to the move. MN Capital founder Michaël van de Poppe noted the strength of the rebound, stating,

Crypto trader Crypto Chase cautioned that Bitcoin must reclaim the $113,400 to $114,000 range with conviction, or else the recent gains could unravel, sending BTC back toward $107,000.

While Bitcoin's short-term recovery is gaining traction, broader onchain trends reveal diverging signals. Earlier, Cointelegraph reported that whale entities holding 1,000 BTC or more have sold off roughly 147,000 BTC, worth $16.5 billion, since Bitcoin's all-time high above $124,500 in August. 

The 2.7% reduction in holdings highlighted sustained selling pressure from large investors, often interpreted as a headwind for price recovery.

Yet, other market indicators suggest the broader environment remained unusually quiet rather than decisively bearish. XWIN Research pointed out that Bitcoin's implied volatility has dropped to its lowest levels since October 2023, a period that preceded a 325% rally from $29,000 to $124,000 for BTC.

The analysis described the current setup as a potential “quiet before the storm,” where low volatility and muted trader positioning may be storing momentum for a decisive move.

Supporting this view, CryptoQuant data underscored exchange reserves hovering at multi-year lows, leaving fewer coins available for selling. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio sits near the neutral zone, implying limited pressure for either panic-selling or aggressive profit-taking. 

Together, these factors painted a market caught between whale-driven distribution and a structural backdrop of tightening supply.

Oops, something went wrong

Publicly traded electric vehicle charging firm Jiuzi Holdings is adopting a crypto investment policy, after its board of directors authorized the firm to deploy up to $1 billion into acquiring and holding Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB. 

Shares of JZXN jumped as high as $2.38 on the news, a 47% spike above its Tuesday closing price, before retracing completely. Shares are now down nearly 10% on the day and changing hands at $1.46. JZXN is down more than 99.9% in the last 5 years.

“Adopting the crypto asset investment policy represents a proactive step in our treasury management to safeguard and enhance long-term shareholder value,” said the firm's CEO Tao Li in a statement. 

Using a strict risk framework, the Chinese firm was authorized to allocate a portion of its cash reserves into BTC, ETH, and BNB. Any additional crypto tokens would need to be approved by the board prior to investment. 

While the board authorized up to $1 billion in crypto purchases, the firm's latest financial filing with the SEC indicates it only had around $943,000 in cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2024. The firm also reported a net income loss of around $55 million for the fiscal year ending on that day.

While some firms creating crypto treasuries raise funds via convertible notes or private investment into public equity (aka PIPE placements), there is no indication of how Jiuzi Holdings intends to raise funds to purchase up to $1 billion in crypto.

A representative for the firm did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment.

The firm will not take custody of any of its crypto assets, and also created a crypto risk asset committee as part of its investment policy framework. 

“We are not engaging in short-term trading or speculation; rather, we view crypto assets as long-term stores of value to hedge against macroeconomic uncertainties,” said its newly appointed COO Dr. Doug Buerger, in a statement.

Bitwise Asset Management says ETH$4,177.62 is rapidly cementing its place as a treasury asset.

Digital asset treasuries (DATs), once largely bitcoin-centric, are now allocating to ether at scale, creating structural demand that exceeds net new supply, the firm said in a Monday report.

"ETH treasuries are no longer a side story. They are becoming a structural pillar in crypto's capital markets," analyst Max Shannon wrote.

According to Bitwise, that demand is reinforced by real yield from transaction fees and maximal extractable value (MEV), which deepens ether's scarcity narrative.

The largest five treasuries, the firm says, reflect a diverse set of strategies, from corporate accumulation and staking to foundations divesting ether to fund ecosystem development. 

This diversity highlights the cryptocurrency's dual identity as both a reserve asset and a productive, yield-bearing instrument, the report said.

Looking forward, Bitwise expects the landscape to consolidate, with “mega whale” and “whale” DATs dominating flows. 

Ether is carving out a distinctive role, not just as a hedge or speculative play, but as a programmable treasury asset that links corporate finance with on-chain economics, the report added.

BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), chaired by Tom Lee, said on Monday that it now controls more than 2% of ether's supply and has raised $365 million to expand its holdings.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Ethereum has reclaimed its position as the primary network for USDT supply, reaching $80 billion and surpassing Tron after falling behind earlier in March. This reversal represents a significant shift in stablecoin infrastructure preferences, with both networks maintaining relatively stable supply levels around $75-$80 billion throughout most of 2025. The close competition between these networks highlights the ongoing shifts in settlement dominance, with marginal advantages potentially driving substantial liquidity migrations.

The redistribution of USDT supply reflects evolving user preferences for blockchain infrastructure, particularly as traditional finance increasingly adopts stablecoin rails. Ethereum's resurgence suggests that users are prioritizing the network's established DeFi ecosystem and institutional-grade infrastructure over Tron's lower transaction costs. Daily stablecoin transfers on Ethereum have reached nearly 1 million transactions per day, indicating not just static holdings but active utilization of USDT for payments and settlements.



This shift occurs as traditional financial institutions increasingly integrate stablecoins into their payment infrastructure. Companies like PayPal with PYUSD and other traditional finance players are incorporating stablecoins into their existing rails, favoring Ethereum's more established institutional presence. The growing institutional adoption of stablecoins suggests that network effects and regulatory clarity will continue to be the main drivers of innovation and adoption.

The competitive dynamics between blockchains for stablecoin dominance carry broader implications for blockchain ecosystem development. The presence of large stablecoin volumes, such as USDT, influences cross-chain bridge activity, exchange integration strategies, and overall DeFi liquidity concentration. Ethereum's advantage in capturing institutional stablecoin flows could reinforce its position as the primary settlement layer for sophisticated financial applications, particularly as traditional finance continues to explore blockchain-based payment solutions.

Oops, something went wrong

Solana is underperforming its blue chip counterparts—like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP—because it's primed to take a bigger hit when investors deleverage and take profits, analysts told Decrypt.

“According to CoinGlass data, over the past 24 hours, market-wide liquidations exceeded $290 million, with highly leveraged and less liquid assets seeing sharper drawdowns—Solana being a prime example,” said Dean Chen, an analyst at crypto exchange Bitunix.

Solana derivatives contracts have accounted for $31.6 million worth of the forced selling in the past day, compared to $68.5 million for Ethereum and $52.2 million for Bitcoin liquidations. At the time of writing, Solana is trading for $213 after having dropped roughly 3% in the past day and more than 9% over the last week, according to crypto price aggregator CoinGecko.

Chen added that last week's bullish Solana treasury news from Forward Industries and DeFi Development Corp. was already priced in because the companies that bought had already announced their plans to do so.

Solana Treasury Firm Holdings Could Double as Forward Industries Unveils $4 Billion Raise

Forward, which trades on the NasdaqCM under the FORD ticker, announced its $1.65 billion raise and intent to buy Solana a few days before the SOL was acquired. And DeFi Development, which trades on the NasdaqCM under the DFDV ticker, has been buying Solana since April.

“Once the announcements became official, the market reacted with a classic ‘buy the rumor, sell the news' dynamic, prompting speculative holders to exit and accelerating the correction,” he said.

The SOL pullback has made users on Myriad, a prediction market owned by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, doubt whether the coin will see a new all-time high before the end of the year. As of this writing, predictors see even 50-50 odds that Solana will rise above the current record of $293.31 in 2025—but predictors were bullish earlier this week, giving a nearly 65% chance of it happening as of Sunday.

There are other factors at play, said Gordon Grant, portfolio manager and head of derivatives at crypto index fund manager Bitwise, He told Decrypt the large FTX estate distribution coming up at the end of the month “threw cold water on the market.”

“In terms of short-term positioning, the 15% pullback from $250 to $210 does not feel extreme given that SOL had rallied over 50% from its early August levels,” he said.

The FTX Recovery Trust said late last week that it would begin distributing another $1.6 billion worth of funds to creditors at the end of the month.

A strategic partnership with the Hilton Family Office is expected to help Kansas City-based Technology Labs on its mission to protect and educate new investors in the crypto jungle, shared co-founder Travis Wright.

The startup announced Tuesday that Hilton Finance — the lending and investment division of the boutique family office with deep ties to the Hilton Hotel empire — is investing $300,000 into its CoinResearch.ai platform, a cryptocurrency research and investing toolkit using AI-driven insights and tools to empower users to make informed, confident crypto investments.



Hilton's support and strategic reach will enable Technology Labs to accelerate its impact and scale its mission globally, said Wright, co-founder of the startup and host of the Bad Crypto podcast, the second-longest-running crypto podcast.

“It's nice to have somebody see what we've done, believe in it, and then put some more money in as we continue to raise,” he added.

The $300,000 is part of a  $1.3 million fundraising round for Technology Labs and is expected to help with its marketing push.

“Technology Labs is helping define the next frontier of financial research in the AI and blockchain space,” said J. Bradley Hilton, chairman of the Hilton Family Office and grandson of hotel magnate Conrad Hilton, in a news release. “We believe their technology stack is foundational to the future of intelligent investing, and we're excited to be part of this journey.”

Wright — along with CMO Shane Hackett and CTO Eric Fellows — launched CoinResearch in March 2024 after he fell for a honeypot scam — where crypto is put in and can't be taken out — while checking into a potential project, he noted.

“If I'm a guy who's been doing crypto since 2010, I'm pretty sophisticated,” Wright continued. “All these people who are coming into crypto now — what we're calling the ‘E-trade babies,' ‘the Motley Fools,' the Gen X and Boomer investors, who've really have done a lion's share of the investing up to this point — they're going to be bringing their money in and it's not safe. It's a jungle.”

This realization led him to hire several financial researchers to create reports around the best AI projects, he said. Hackett — CMO at Legion Capital and Chairman of the Board at MarketLeverage who made the connections to Hilton Finance — was so impressed by the reports that he encouraged him to turn it into a product.

“We've been working on it now for about 18 months, all self funded,” he added. “Then the Hilton Family Office is like, ‘Hey, we'd like to utilize this information to help us on our new Hilton tech fund.'”

CoinResearch is designed to provide users with in-depth analysis, accurate ratings, and expert recommendations for cryptocurrency investments. Its advanced algorithms analyze vast amounts of data to deliver actionable insights that can help users make informed trading decisions.

“A lot of people in the crypto space will typically raise and have nothing,” Wright said. “They say, ‘Here's what we're gonna do.' Having been in crypto for so long and having paid attention to the crypto markets in the space for so long, I didn't want vaporware. If we're going to raise money, I want us to have something that's legit and built and badass and already working that way. When somebody comes in, they're not just buying hopes and dreams.”

IREN (IREN), one of the largest self-operated BTC$113,965.34 miners in the U.S., is breaking away from the pack, and Wall Street is taking notice.

Bernstein analysts raised their price target on IREN to $75 from $20, implying about 80% upside, as the miner doubles down on building its own AI cloud business rather than relying on co-location deals with partners like CoreWeave (CRWV).

IREN has already had a major move, ahead more than eight-fold from its 52-week low of $5.13 hit in April. The shares are higher by 365% year-over-year.

The broker now sees IREN's AI pivot as credible, despite early skepticism about the miner's ability to execute on a capital-intensive data center build-out and compete with AI cloud players tied to hyperscalers and Nvidia (NVDA).

IREN is guiding for rapid growth, the report noted, with $500 million in annual recurring revenue by Q1 2026 on 23,300 GPUs, up from roughly $14 million in Q1 2025.

Beyond AI, IREN retains flexibility with its 3 gigawatt (GW) power portfolio, balancing bitcoin mining and AI workloads to maximize revenue per megawatt, Bernstein analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.

Its 50 EH/s mining operation generates an estimated $600 million in annualized EBITDA at current bitcoin prices, funding its AI expansion, according to the analysts.

Bernstein has shifted its valuation approach to a sum-of-parts model, assigning 87% of enterprise value to AI cloud and co-location potential at IREN's 2GW West Texas site, with the remaining 13% coming from bitcoin mining. 

At the revised target, IREN would trade at $7.5 million per megawatt (MW), above other AI-focused miners but still far below established data center peers like CoreWeave, suggesting further room for multiple expansion, the report added.

Ripple's prime brokerage, Hidden Road, has expanded its services to enhance institutional crypto trading. The company has partnered with ABEX, a provider of execution algorithms for institutional trading. This partnership integrates ABEX's technology with Ripple's brokerage infrastructure, offering global clients advanced execution tools in digital asset markets.

Hidden Road and ABEX announced their collaboration to provide agency execution capabilities for digital assets. The partnership allows clients to access ABEX's execution algorithms through Ripple's prime brokerage and custody services. These tools are designed to improve precision, reduce costs, and increase transparency in fragmented crypto markets.

Michael Higgins, International CEO at Hidden Road, commented on the partnership. He stated, “ABEX shares our commitment to bringing precision, transparency, and execution quality to digital assets.” Hidden Road aims to provide institutions with sophisticated tools to enhance their trading experience. The collaboration strengthens the company's position in the digital asset space, offering clients an efficient trading infrastructure.

ABEX's technology focuses on improving trading outcomes by optimizing execution strategies. The integration allows Hidden Road clients to trade across multiple venues while maintaining seamless workflow. The collaboration positions Ripple's Hidden Road as a key player in transforming institutional trading in the digital asset sector.

Ripple's acquisition of Hidden Road in April 2025 enabled the payments company to enter the prime brokerage space. The $1.25 billion acquisition marked a significant move for Ripple, allowing it to operate a global, multi-asset prime broker. Hidden Road's infrastructure complements Ripple's blockchain technology, providing a solid foundation for growing institutional interest in digital assets.

The Ripple-Hidden Road partnership supports clients in trading various asset classes, including foreign exchange, digital assets, and fixed income. Ripple's acquisition strengthens the combined firm's offerings, enhancing its competitiveness in the rapidly evolving crypto market. The new service expansions include advanced execution tools and OTC options for institutional clients.

Hidden Road's recent developments include launching OTC options for digital assets in partnership with QCP and BlockTech. These features allow clients to execute options while leveraging cross-margining on their digital holdings. This addition makes Ripple's Hidden Road even more appealing to institutional investors seeking flexible solutions in the digital asset space.

Canton Network, a blockchain built for regulated finance, has struck a strategic partnership with Chainlink to broaden institutional adoption.

The agreement, announced Wednesday, will see Canton integrate Chainlink's suite of services, including Data Streams, Proof of Reserve, and its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol. Canton has also joined the Chainlink Scale program, which helps cover the costs of running oracle nodes that feed external data into blockchains.

Chainlink Labs will take on the role of Super Validator in Canton's Global Synchronizer, a system designed to keep transactions across the network in sync. That places Chainlink alongside a roster of more than 30 super validators and 500 validators already supporting Canton, which processes $280 billion in daily repo transactions and secures over $6 trillion in tokenized real-world assets.

For institutions, the deal could mean faster access to tokenized securities, stablecoins, and digital identity tools without sacrificing compliance or privacy. Imagine a bank issuing tokenized bonds on Canton and relying on Chainlink to confirm collateral values in real time—a scenario designed to cut costs while reducing counterparty risk.

Chainlink already secures more than $100 billion across decentralized finance and has helped facilitate $25 trillion in transaction value. Its entry into Canton aligns with growing demand from financial firms exploring tokenized assets and cross-chain applications.

“The collaboration brings together Canton's focus on regulated finance with Chainlink's infrastructure, paving the way for real-world institutional use cases,” Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in the release.

The trend reflects diverse use cases from remittances to gaming, but regulatory uncertainty could limit long-term potential, analysts say

The Asia-Pacific region has become the world's fastest-growing hub for cryptocurrency transactions, with on-chain activity surging despite inconsistent oversight and varied pathways to adoption, according to a new report.

Analysts say the trend reflects not only diverse use cases – from remittances and savings to gaming and speculative trading – but also regulatory uncertainty across the region, which could limit long-term potential even as momentum builds.

The report, released on Wednesday by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, found that during the 12 months ending June 2025, Asia-Pacific had emerged as the fastest-growing region for on-chain crypto activity, with a 69 per cent year-over-year increase in value received.

Total crypto transaction volume in the region grew from US$1.4 trillion to US$2.36 trillion, driven by robust engagement across major markets including India, Vietnam and Pakistan.

Monthly on-chain value received grew from about US$81 billion in July 2022 to peak at US$244 billion in December 2024, a threefold increase over 30 months. Transaction volumes have since remained robust at above US$185 billion per month through mid-2025.

In contrast to North America, where cryptocurrency activity is largely driven by institutional investment, Asia-Pacific's growth is fuelled by broader, more retail-oriented demand, according to Chengyi Ong, head of Asia-Pacific policy at Chainalysis.

 Chainalysis APAC policy lead Chengyi Ong says favorable policy and taxes helped boost crypto in Japan, while stablecoins were popular across the Asia Pacific. 

Japan's recent policy shifts have helped the country more than double its crypto adoption over the past year, according to crypto analytics company Chainalysis.

Among the top five markets in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region, Japan saw the strongest growth, with its value received onchain growing 120% year-on-year in the 12 months to June, according to an excerpt from Chainalysis' 2025 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report released on Wednesday.

Chainalysis' head of APAC policy, Chengyi Ong, told Cointelegraph that activity in Japan “reflects some of the trends that we saw in the global market, a sharp pickup in trading volumes in the fourth quarter of 2024 on the back of the US presidential election, followed by a tapering.”

Meanwhile, Atsushi Kuwabara, chief business development officer at Japanese crypto exchange Bitbank, told Cointelegraph that the company had seen “steady growth in platform usage year over year” to August for both new and returning users.

Japan has looked to reform its crypto laws to align the sector's rules with the traditional securities market and change its taxation rules to lower taxes on crypto. Last month, the country's regulators also greenlit the first stablecoin pegged to the yen.

“Japan's growth is on the heels of important advances in its crypto industry,” Chainalysis said. “For some time now, regulatory restrictions have constrained the listing of stablecoins on domestic exchanges, although this is now beginning to change.”

Ong said that market activity in Japan “has been stable but subdued relative to regional peers like South Korea,” but crypto use in the country “is likely to be boosted by expectations of upcoming policy changes.”

Chainalysis' report added that the growth in crypto value received doubled in Indonesia, South Korea and India, which showed “continued expansion but from already high baselines,” while a 55% growth in Vietnam suggested a “maturing market where crypto is already deeply embedded in remittances and everyday financial activity.”

The company noted its report earlier this month found the Asia Pacific was the “fastest-growing region in the world in terms of onchain value received,” with India topping its Global Adoption Index.

In the future, the markets “will be keenly watching” how stablecoins such as USDC (USDC) and the recently greenlighted JPYC gain traction, Chainalysis said.

Ong said that stablecoins are “becoming a key component in APAC's crypto adoption trends,” and are prominent across several of the region's markets.

She added that South Korea, in particular, saw banks take a “keen interest” in the development of stablecoin laws, and Chainalysis reported that stablecoin trading volumes jumped by over 50% early this year, with total purchases reaching $59 billion in the year to June.

“USD-backed stablecoins have gained significant traction in that market,” Ong said. “It will be interesting to see whether that dynamic shifts when we eventually get won-backed stablecoins.”

She added that Australia “will also be an interesting one to watch in the future” with its recent shift in its treatment of stablecoins.

“Even though legislation has been slow to materialize, regulators recently licensed one stablecoin under the existing financial services regime, and took steps to facilitate usage by granting regulatory relief to distributors,” Ong said.

Chainalysis reported that the top five growing markets in the region had “strikingly different pathways into crypto,” with each having differing use cases; however, remittances were a recurring theme.

India saw young adults use crypto to trade to boost their income, while a large number of Indians outside of the country used crypto for remittances. Vietnam also used crypto as “everyday infrastructure for remittances, gaming, and savings rather than speculation.”

Pakistan, meanwhile, has a “young, mobile-first population” that uses stablecoins as a hedge against inflation and for payments, while South Korea traded crypto “almost like equities” as new laws are “reshaping activity on major domestic exchanges,” Chainalysis said.

It added that the so-called “smaller markets” of Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong saw steps to align policy and regulatory regimes, aiming for greater and clearer oversight of the sector.

 Introduced in October 2020, Europe's digital euro may not launch until 2029, according to ECB Executive Board member Piero Cipollone. 

The digital euro, the European Union's long-planned central bank digital currency (CBDC) project, is facing delays, with its launch now expected around mid-2029.

The EU's digital euro could become a reality in 2029, European Central Bank Executive Board member Piero Cipollone said in a Bloomberg Future of Finance event Tuesday in Frankfurt.

“The middle of 2029 could be a fair assessment,” he said, adding that the ECB has been actively discussing the project at the level of EU member states.

If correct, Cipollone's timeline would signal another delay for the digital euro, despite widespread calls to launch the CBDC to protect Europe's financial sovereignty amid the US stablecoin push.

According to Cipollone, the European Parliament has been the biggest obstacle to progress toward a digital euro, as it must pass legislation to move forward with the project.

“We should arrive at a general approach, as they call it, an agreement among member-states by the end of the year,” he said, adding that the Parliament is likely to have a position on a digital euro by May 2026.

Cipollone's assessment on Europe's CBDC launch came soon after EU ministers reached a “compromise” on the digital euro roadmap last week, imposing holding limits on the potential digital currency.

“The compromise that we reached is that before the ECB makes a final decision in relation to issuance [...] there would be an opportunity for a discussion in the Council of Ministers,” Irish Finance Minister and Eurogroup President Paschal Donohoe said at a news conference last Friday.

While Cipollone expects the digital euro won't launch before mid-2029, European authorities are pressing ahead with CBDC preparations, with the ECB targeting October to decide whether to move to the next phase.

A spokesperson for the ECB told Cointelegraph on Wednesday that a member of the European Parliament (MEP) is expected to deliver a progress report on the digital euro on Oct. 24.

Following the report, lawmakers will have six weeks to put forward amendments and a further five months for discussions, Cipollone reportedly said.

Officially introduced by the ECB in October 2020, the digital euro project has emerged as one of Europe's longest-discussed financial initiatives.

In June 2023, the European Commission published a legal proposal for a potential digital euro, yet progress within the European Parliament has remained limited.

Meanwhile, the ECB has steadily advanced the project, completing its investigation phase in November 2023 and moving into a preparation phase set to finish by October 2025.

Despite these steps, the initiative has faced significant skepticism from banks, lawmakers, member states, as well as end users, largely due to concerns around CBDC privacy.

Globally, some central banks have piloted their own digital currencies for years. China, for example, launched a pilot digital yuan wallet in early 2022. However, the digital yuan has encountered slow adoption, with critics describing many CBDCs as costly fiat replicas rather than genuine fintech innovations.

 Introduced in October 2020, Europe's digital euro may not launch until 2029, according to ECB Executive Board member Piero Cipollone. 

The digital euro, the European Union's long-planned central bank digital currency (CBDC) project, is facing delays, with its launch now expected around mid-2029.

The EU's digital euro could become a reality in 2029, European Central Bank Executive Board member Piero Cipollone said in a Bloomberg Future of Finance event Tuesday in Frankfurt.

“The middle of 2029 could be a fair assessment,” he said, adding that the ECB has been actively discussing the project at the level of EU member states.

Speaking at a Bloomberg Future of Finance event in Frankfurt, Cipollone said the effort to create a digital euro had a “major breakthrough” last week when relevant finance chiefs reached an agreement on how to set customer holding limits, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.

The effort now has momentum, Cipollone said, according to the report.

The European Parliament, whose legislation is required to enable the digital euro, is set to receive a progress report on the initiative on Oct. 24 and could vote on the required legislation by May 2026, Cipollone said, per the report.

It was reported Sunday (Sept. 21) that European Union finance ministers agreed on a roadmap for launching a digital euro backed by the European Central Bank and that their input was considered crucial to assuage fears that a digital currency could lead to a run on traditional bank deposits.

In February, it was reported that the European Central Bank was hoping that progress on legislative approval for a digital euro would be spurred by U.S. President Donald Trump's endorsement of dollar-pegged stablecoins.

The European Commission put forward digital euro legislation in June 2023, but progress had been sluggish.

Cipollone said in the February report that Trump's support for stablecoins tied to the U.S. dollar introduced another American-driven financial tool and increased the urgency to move forward with a digital euro.

In March, it was reported that European Stability Mechanism Managing Director Pierre Gramegna said that Europe's monetary autonomy and financial stability could be threatened by the Trump administration's interest in cryptocurrencies and dollar-denominated stablecoins.

Gramegna said that in light of the change in the U.S. perception of digital currencies, the ESM believed that “this digital euro is today more necessary than ever.”

Cipollone said Sept. 4 that the European Union should accelerate its efforts to introduce a digital euro, in part because this technology would support resilience and inclusiveness.

A digital euro would complement physical cash, which remains essential for resilience and inclusion, and would provide another universally accepted means of payment, Cipollone said.

“In an increasingly digital world exposed to new geopolitical and operational risks, we must protect the euro's availability for all Europeans at all times,” Cipollone said.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Fundstrat co-founder and BitMine Chairman Tom Lee said Ethereum is a "truly neutral chain" that will be favored by Wall Street and the White House.

"I don't think anyone ever feels that someone's got a fat finger tilting [Ethereum] in their favor," Lee said, during Korea Blockchain Week 2025's Impact conference on Wednesday. "If you think about how Wall Street operates, they will only wanna do and operate on a neutral chain."

Lee further explained that he observed the White House and Congress, which had become more pro-crypto under the Trump administration, are primarily turning to Ethereum.

"So when I look at that, combined with agentic AI and robots that are really gonna create the need for a token economy for robots, a lot of that will happen on Ethereum," Lee said. "In fact, President Trump today just talked about how he needs proof-of-human to protect us, and a lot of that work is going to be done on Ethereum."

When the Wall Street strategist engineered BitMine's transformation into an ETH treasury vehicle, Lee said he saw the possibility that Ethereum was entering a "super cycle" that would last 10 to 15 years. 

Since transitioning into an Ethereum treasury company, BitMine's market capitalization grew from around $37.6 million in June, before the transition, to around $9.45 billion as of Wednesday. 

BitMine is currently the largest Ethereum treasury in the world, holding 2.15 million ETH, according to The Block's corporate treasuries data. It is also the second largest crypto treasury firm overall, behind Michael Saylor's Strategy.



Lee said that he thinks there is room for more than one Ethereum treasury firms, but stated that the market is picking its winners and losers.

"Bitmine trades $3 billion a day, Microstrategy trades $3.4 billion a day. I think the two of us represent 95% of all trading volume in the DATs," Lee said. "The two of us are 90% of the trading volume. That means institutions really only want to buy us."

Lee said the two companies have essentially become large-cap stocks, and they are going to receive passive flows as they will become a part of major indices when they rebalance.

"That really helped MicroStrategy too, and that's actually what sustains valuation premiums, because now you have someone who's buying every day."

Meanwhile, Lee said he expects bitcoin price to end the year between $200,000 and $250,000, while ether is expected to land between $10,000 and $12,000.

"I'm still bullish on bitcoin," Lee said during the conference discussion. "In the fourth quarter, seasonally bitcoin is strong. But now we have the Fed flipping dovish after being essentially hawkish all year. That's a tailwind for bitcoin." 

Lee added that his estimate aligns with Fundstrat CMT Mark Newton's technical targets. 

"Ethereum, as a price ratio to bitcoin, should recover to its prior, either average or at least five-year highs," Lee stated. "Using a $250,000 Bitcoin, that implies somewhere between 10 and 12,000 for Ethereum by the end of the year."

The BitMine chairman said he expects Ethereum to surpass its prior highs, and the cryptocurrency's "real price discovery" will be between $12,000 and $15,000. "But I don't think that would be the ceiling for Ethereum," Lee added.

We have issued an enforcement notice to Bristol City Council (BCC) for failing to comply with its legal obligations to respond to people who asked for the personal information the council held on them – known as a subject access request (SAR). 

Sally-Anne Poole, Head of Investigations at the ICO, said: 

“Subject access requests are a fundamental right that allows people to know what information organisations hold about them and how it is being used. Despite our repeated engagement with Bristol City Council over a sustained period of time, limited progress has been made to clear a backlog of requests. Our investigation has found that the Council's approach towards compliance demonstrates a poor organisational attitude towards data rights and compliance with the law. This enforcement notice requires them to clear their SAR backlog in a timely manner, and make lasting improvements to bring their practices in line with the law.” 

The full enforcement notice can be read here. 

 

The enforcement notice requires BCC to take the following actions: 

People have the right to ask an organisation for the personal data they hold about them, why they are holding it and who they are sharing it with. A person can make a SAR verbally or in writing, including via social media. A person does not need to use a specific form of words, refer to legislation or direct the request to a specific contact. 

You can find guidance on making a SAR on the ICO website. 

If you have concerns about an organisation's response, you can raise a complaint with them directly and then, if unresolved, report it to us.

Bitcoin's recent 10% fall from its all-time high of $124,500 in early August has sparked speculation about whether this is just a healthy pullback or the beginning of a market top.

Now, popular analytics firm Glassnode has released its latest report suggesting that we could actually be witnessing a ‘historically late phase' of Bitcoin's current market cycle.

The most interesting takeaway from the report was Bitcoin's latest cycle being compared with the 2018-2022 and 2015-2018 bull runs.



In both those instances – and in the current stage – the same metrics flashed similar signals.

And in both cases, Bitcoin went on to reach an ATH within the following 2-3 months, which then marked the cycle's market top.

Read on as we unpack Bitcoin's latest fundamental signals with the help of DeepSeek. Spoiler alert: it's not all negative. In fact, there are plenty of positive signs.

And with that in mind, we'll also point you toward the best altcoins to buy right now.

Although institutional and long-term Bitcoin holders have grown increasingly wary of getting in at all-time highs, short-term holders have been aggressively adding the digital gold to their portfolios.

All in all, it's clear that Bitcoin is in a sensitive position right now, with macroeconomic factors like rate cuts and growing crypto clarity working in its favor, while exchange numbers and on-chain data also suggest we could see a potential deeper correction before rebounding.

Whatever the case, it's hard to argue against Bitcoin and crypto in general heading toward a brighter future.

If you want to ride that particular tailwind without getting caught up in short-term corrections or volatility, you'll be better off picking low-cap, high-potential gems that can deliver not only on hype but also on long-term vision.

Here are our top 3 suggestions, based on DeepSeek AI's expert analysis.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is easily the best crypto presale on the market right now, having already raised nearly $18M from early investors in just a few weeks.

Even better, there's no shortage of whale participation in this presale. For instance, two large whale buys scooped up nearly $100K worth of $HYPER just yesterday.

What's driving Bitcoin's growth? A game-changing mission to turbocharge the Bitcoin blockchain with Solana-like speed, scalability, and programmability.

Bitcoin Hyper is a Layer-2 solution that integrates with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), ditching the popular Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), in order to execute thousands of transactions simultaneously, effectively solving Bitcoin's age-old issue of sluggish speeds.



Even better, developers and users on Bitcoin won't have to sacrifice Bitcoin's native security to reap the benefits of Hyper's lightning-fast execution.

That's because Bitcoin Hyper batches the results of all transactions and submits a summary to Bitcoin's main chain.

You can interact with these applications by simply converting your Layer-1 Bitcoin into wrapped, Layer-2 compatible $BTC tokens via Bitcoin Hyper's non-custodial, decentralized canonical bridge.

According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction, the token could hit $0.32 by the end of 2025 – so a massive 2,300% ROI could be yours if you get in now.

1 $HYPER is currently available for just $0.012965, and here's our detailed guide on how to buy Bitcoin Hyper.

Visit Bitcoin Hyper's official website to learn more about how its canonical bridge ensures seamless access to Bitcoin's new Web3 environment.

While many might believe that Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a slightly out-of-the-pocket suggestion when crafting a long-term crypto portfolio, DeepSeek points out that its Dogecoin theme and rampant hype could make it the next 1000x crypto.

If you want to fully understand Maxi's potential, you need to be aware of his backstory.

Both Maxi and Dogecoin belong to the same family of Shiba Inu, but due to the OG crypto's fame, Maxi never received the love and appreciation from his family.

That ignited a fire within him, which he honed in the gym and in the charts, to now emerge as the ultimate Doge nemesis.

Maxi's plan is to dominate the meme coin market, potentially even surpassing Dogecoin in both market cap and raw returns. This mission is fueled by a roadmap that focuses on virality.



The developers have reserved a whopping 40% of the total token supply for promotional activities, including PR campaigns, influencer partnerships, and social media blitzes.

The token has the potential to hit $0.0024 by the end of this year – according to our $MAXI price prediction – giving you an eye-popping 820% return.

At the time of writing, the Maxi Doge presale has accumulated over $2.4M from early investors, with each token available for just $0.000259. Here's how to buy $MAXI in 4 simple steps.

Check out Maxi Doge's official website to learn all about its hatred for Dogecoin, roadmap, and tokenomics.

$BNB‘s recent run-up to new all-time highs, at a time when other mainstream tokens like $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, and $XRP are all either in red or barely in green for the month, have made it one of the best cryptos to watch right now.

Although conventional investing wisdom advises against getting in at ATHs, there's a high likelihood $BNB might not churn out the pullback you're waiting for.

Why? Because it just broke out of a 4-year long consolidation zone, which lasted from May 2021 to May 2025.



Since this breakout, $BNB is up over 50%, and according to this trading pattern, we can expect the token to charge toward $2,000 in the coming weeks.

We arrived at this target by measuring the width of the consolidation phase and projecting it onto the breakout level – according to the technical analysis playbook.

Interested? Buy $BNB today on Binance, or any of the other major crypto exchanges.

Metrics details

Cell types are fundamental functional units that can be traced across the tree of life. Rapid advances in single-cell technologies, coupled with the phylogenetic expansion in genome sequencing, present opportunities for the molecular characterization of cells across a broad range of organisms. Despite these developments, our understanding of eukaryotic cell diversity remains limited and we are far from decoding this diversity from genome sequences. Here we introduce the Biodiversity Cell Atlas initiative, which aims to create comprehensive single-cell molecular atlases across the eukaryotic tree of life. This community effort will be phylogenetically informed, rely on high-quality genomes and use shared standards to facilitate comparisons across species. The Biodiversity Cell Atlas aspires to deepen our understanding of the evolution and diversity of life at the cellular level, encompassing gene regulatory programs, differentiation trajectories, cell-type-specific molecular profiles and inter-organismal interactions.

Metrics details

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are highly effective in haematological malignancies1. However, progressive loss of CAR T cells contributes to relapse in many patients2,3,4. Here we performed in vivo loss-of-function CRISPR screens in CAR T cells targeting B cell maturation antigen to investigate genes that influence CAR T cell persistence and function in a human multiple myeloma model. We tracked the expansion and persistence of CRISPR library-edited T cells in vitro and at early and late time points in vivo to track the performance of gene-modified CAR T cells from manufacturing to survival in tumours. The screens revealed context-specific regulators of CAR T cell expansion and persistence. Ablation of RASA2 and SOCS1 enhanced T cell expansion in vitro, whereas loss of PTPN2, ZC3H12A and RC3H1 conferred early growth advantages to CAR T cells in vivo. Notably, we identified cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (encoded by CDKN1B), a cell cycle regulator, as the most important factor limiting CAR T cell fitness at late time points in vivo. CDKN1B ablation increased CAR T cell proliferation and effector function, significantly enhancing tumour clearance and overall survival. Our findings reveal differing effects of gene perturbation on CAR T cells over time and in different environments, highlight CDKN1B as a promising target to generate highly effective CAR T cells for multiple myeloma and underscore the potential of in vivo screening for identifying genes to enhance CAR T cell efficacy.

Quantification of insertions/deletions (indels) in sgRNA target region by next generation sequencing. Data represents target sgRNA 1 and 2 for CDKN1B, PTPN2, and RASA2, respectively (n = 2 samples); presented as mean +/– SEM. e. IL2RA expression by flow cytometry, with IL2RA KO CAR-T cells (before electroporation/CD3 negative selection and after) compared to UTD and intergenic control KO (both IL-2 and IL-7/IL-15-produced, respectively). UTD = untransduced T cells.

a-b. 16-hour luciferase-based killing assay of knockout CAR-T cells co-cultured with MM.1S tumor cells (a, n = 4 technical replicates from CAR-T cells generated from two normal donors, ND116, ND202) or RPMI-8226 (b, n = 2 technical replicates from CAR-T cells generated from one normal donor), at different effector to target (E:T) ratios (from 10:1 to 1:100). Upper panels display comparison of intergenic KO CAR-T cells to UTD. Middle and lower panels show relative killing of IL2RA KO (IL-2- or IL-7/IL-15-produced; middle panel) or CDKN1B KO, PTPN2 KO, and RASA2 KO (lower panel) compared to intergenic KO CAR-T cells.

Metrics details

Despite decades of investigation, it remains unclear (and hard to predict1,2,3,4) how the outcomes of chemical reactions change over multidimensional ‘hyperspaces' defined by reaction conditions5. Whereas human chemists can explore only a limited subset of these manifolds, automated platforms6,7,8,9,10,11,12 can generate thousands of reactions in parallel. Yet, purification and yield quantification remain bottlenecks, constrained by time-consuming and resource-intensive analytical techniques. As a result, our understanding of reaction hyperspaces remains fragmentary7,9,13,14,15,16. Are yield distributions smooth or corrugated? Do they conceal mechanistically new reactions? Can major products vary across different regions? Here, to address these questions, we developed a low-cost robotic platform using primarily optical detection to quantify yields of products and by-products at unprecedented throughput and minimal cost per condition. Scanning hyperspaces across thousands of conditions, we find and prove mathematically that, for continuous variables (concentrations, temperatures), individual yield distributions are generally slow-varying. At the same time, we uncover hyperspace regions of unexpected reactivity as well as switchovers between major products. Moreover, by systematically surveying substrate proportions, we reconstruct underlying reaction networks and expose hidden intermediates and products—even in reactions studied for well over a century. This hyperspace-scanning approach provides a versatile and scalable framework for reaction optimization and discovery. Crucially, it can help identify conditions under which complex mixtures can be driven cleanly towards different major products, thereby expanding synthetic diversity while reducing chemical input requirements.

Owing to rapid advances in chemical automation, there has been a growing number of high-throughput campaigns to discover new modes of reactivity6,7,12,16,17, maximize reaction yields (often under the guidance of various optimization algorithms9,15,18) and produce standardized data sought urgently19 by chemical artificial intelligence. Our goals here were different, as we wished to reconstruct complete portraits of chemical reactions over multidimensional parameter spaces (concentrations, temperatures), with the quantification of yields not only for the major products but also for as many by-products as could be identified. Anticipating thousands of crude mixtures to analyse (here >9,000 in total), we wished to minimize the use of techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS), which, at their maximum throughput of only a few samples per hour, become costly and require prolonged or even dedicated access to equipment, which may be prohibitive for most academic groups. Accordingly, we relied heavily on inexpensive (cents per sample) and rapid (about 100 samples per hour) ultraviolet–visible (UV-Vis) detection augmented with algorithms to decompose complex spectra (that is, not just those featuring distinct and easy-to-interpret spectral features20,21) and with autocorrelation metrics to quantify missing information and detect anomalous outcomes.

Unless otherwise stated, experiments were performed on a robotic platform (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Video 1) house-built to support various organic solvents and harsh reagents and allowing us to execute and characterize up to roughly 1,000 reactions per day (for design blueprints and computer codes, see Methods and Supplementary Information Sections 1 and 2).

a, Parts of the house-built, inexpensive (about $25K) system: (1) horizontal gantry; (2) liquid-handling module; (3) racks of pipette tips; (4) stock solutions; (5) 54-vial plates; (6) UV-Vis spectrophotometer; (7) balance for weighing of solutions (see Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). b, Hypothetical A + B → C reaction space defined by initial concentrations [A]0 and [B]0 and temperature T. c, UV-Vis spectra of the HPLC-isolated species are measured at different concentrations (here for Claisen–Schmidt condensation from Fig. 2a). d, At each point of the conditions' space, the UV-Vis spectrum (grey) is decomposed—here nearly perfectly—into the component spectra from c, quantifying the concentrations/yields of these components in the crude mixture. e, Stoichiometry of reaction places constraints on possible concentrations (blue) of components in the crude mixture (see Methods). f, Example of a perfect linear dependence (‘multicollinearity'), in which the brown spectrum in the top subplot happens to be a linear sum of the cyan and purple ones (scaled by, respectively, 0.50 and 0.25). Consequently, unmixing is an ill-conditioned problem, as the spectrum of the entire mixture (black) can be decomposed into infinitely many combinations of the brown, cyan and purple components (1:1:1 in the top and 0.5:0.75:2 in the bottom subplots). g, Correlation matrix for components A, B and C of the Claisen–Schmidt condensation from d. Low off-diagonal elements indicate no strong multicollinearity. h, Statistical distributions of yields with respect to the limiting reagent. Relative standard deviations are 2% between repeated optical detection performed on the same crude mixture (n = 54) and 5% between experimental repeats (n = 27) of the entire workflow for the same conditions (data from Fig. 5). i, Differences between experimental and modelled spectra (from d) as a function of wavelength. The fit is adequate, as this trace closely resembles uncorrelated (‘white') noise.

For a given reaction under study, this robot examines the hyperspace of conditions at points of some N-dimensional grid (for example, uniform in Fig. 1b), setting up reactions and acquiring UV-Vis absorption spectra at each point and at desired time(s). The acquisition of an individual spectrum takes, on average, roughly 8 s, whereas the accompanying pipetting and spectrometer washing–drying take about 50 s in total (Supplementary Video 2). In a subsequent (and perhaps counterintuitive) step, the crudes from all hyperspace points are combined (Fig. 1b, left). The resultant mixture is separated by chromatography and the isolated fractions are identified by traditional spectroscopic (NMR, MS) analyses. This ‘bulk' analysis is to identify the ‘basis set' of reaction products that form in any appreciable quantities anywhere in the hyperspace. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of these purified products (as well as all substrates, solvents and reagents used) at different concentrations are taken to construct concentration–absorbance calibration curves (Fig. 1c). Then the crude and often complex UV-Vis spectra acquired at each point of the hyperspace (Fig. 1b, right) are fitted by linear combinations of the reference spectra of the basis-set components (Fig. 1d) using the so-called vector decomposition techniques (also known as spectral unmixing22). Overall, this protocol requires conventional high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/NMR/MS analysis of only one complex mixture combining all hyperspace samples (Fig. 1c). It returns on this time investment manifolds by rapidly estimating the yields and mixture compositions at thousands of individual data points within the hyperspace of the reaction.

This general scheme merits two comments. First, it is important to reject potential unmixing solutions violating reaction stoichiometry (Fig. 1e) and to ensure stability of the fit. The latter benefits from the absorption spectra of components being of similar magnitudes and not linearly dependent (Fig. 1f), which is diagnosed by looking at off-diagonal elements of the correlation matrix between the concentrations of the components (Fig. 1g). Satisfying these conditions (1) is increasingly challenging as the number of components increases but (2) is helped by extending the spectral range as much as possible into the UV, at which the absorption bands of organic species are usually more numerous and narrower (see the example in Fig. 5b). With these precautions, yield estimates are within 5% (for example, a 20% yield would have a spread of 19–21%), with optical measurement and spectral unmixing contributing 2% and the remaining 3% caused by uncertainty of pipetting, fluctuations of temperature and residual evaporation (Fig. 1h and Supplementary Information Sections 2.10 and 2.11).

Second, the fitting procedure is accompanied by an algorithm to detect anomalous outcomes in some regions of the hyperspace. This is done by tracking differences between experimental and fitted spectra, calculating the variance of residuals (Fig. 1i) and evaluating the autocorrelation (across wavelengths, not time) of these residuals by the Durbin–Watson statistic. The mismatch is considered notable if the root mean square residual exceeds 0.01 absorbance units or if the Durbin–Watson statistic at 30 nm ‘lag' deviates from the value of 2 (which corresponds to the absence of autocorrelation) more strongly than the respective statistic for the baseline of a given spectrophotometer. If systematic deviation is detected, it then signifies formation of a product unexpected based on the initial scan of the hyperspace (see Fig. 3d,e). Further mathematical details of spectral unmixing and anomaly detection are discussed in Supplementary Information Section 3.

We confirmed that this method is applicable to a range of reactions used widely in both academic groups and industry, including various couplings, condensations, cycloadditions and rearrangements (reactions 1–8 on the green background in Extended Data Fig. 1a), as well as substitutions, eliminations and multicomponent reactions (MCRs), discussed in detail in Figs. 2–6. Expectedly, the approach is not suitable for, for example, reactions of aliphatic scaffolds whose products give no signal in the UV-Vis range above 220 nm and some reactions are borderline in terms of fit quality, owing to the obstruction of the product signal by reactant/solvent peaks (for example, 9–12 in the yellow and red portions of Extended Data Fig. 1a). Notably, yields quantified by the robotized approach correlate strongly, R2 = 0.96, with the yields of the same reactions performed, purified and analysed ex roboto (Extended Data Fig. 1b).

a,b, Schemes of E1 (a) and SN1 (b) reactions and their mechanisms. For the former, we use 9-butyl-9H-fluoren-9-ol substrate 13a and for the latter, to prevent elimination, 9-phenyl-9H-fluoren-9-ol 14a. For E1, the parameters of the mechanism are the temperature dependences of equilibrium constant Kα for dynamic equilibrium between 13a and its protonated form, of equilibrium constant Kβ for dynamic equilibrium between 13b and its protonated form, of pKa of HBr in acetonitrile and the Eyring–Polanyi equation parameters for kinetic rate constants kE1 and k−E1 for water molecule elimination from the protonated 13a (Supplementary Information Section 5.2). For SN1 at a given temperature, the only parameter is the effective equilibrium constant KSN1 = [14b][H2O]/([14a][HBr]) (Supplementary Information Section 5.1). E1 used acetonitrile as solvent. For SN1, the solvent was dioxane with admixture of AcOH (to homogenize the biphasic dioxane–water mixture formed in situ and complicating optical detection). c,d, Corresponding yield distributions of products 13b and 14b. For clarity, only 125 conditions per cube are shown. Marker colours and sizes are proportional to yields. Yield colour scales are the same for both cubes. Surfaces of equal yield are at 20%, 40%, 70% and 85%. e,f, Kinetics model (curves) fitted to experimental yields with respect to alcohol (circles) for E1 and SN1 reactions. To better visualize the quality of fits, only two-dimensional snapshots of the entire dataset are shown, here T = 21 °C for E1 and T = 36 °C for SN1 (for similar plots at all temperatures, see Supplementary Information Sections 5.1 and 5.2). Horizontal axis has the initial concentrations of HBr, with the colour corresponding to different initial concentrations of the alcohol indicated in the keys.

a, Scheme of a reaction between alcohol 15a and HBr leading to major product 15b through anthranyl carbocation 15c. The minor anthraquinone product 15d originates from the cycloaddition of substrate 15a with singlet oxygen to give the endoperoxide, followed by subsequent fragmentations (for details, see Supplementary Fig. 32). The ‘unexpected' carbocation dimer structure is assigned to 15e (for details of structural assignment, see Supplementary Information Sections 4.13 and 6.2). b, Space of reaction yields of the main product 15b under different conditions (reaction time: 24 h; for clarity, only 125 out of 1,085 points are shown; for all data, see Supplementary Information Section 4.15). Fitting the kinetic model to these experimental data reveals that yields of product 15b scale as \(1-\exp \left(-t{k}_{1}[{\rm{HBr}}]\exp \left(-\frac{{E}_{{\rm{a}}}}{{k}_{{\rm{B}}}T}\right)\right)\), in which t is reaction time, \({k}_{1}\exp \left(-\frac{{E}_{{\rm{a}}}}{{k}_{{\rm{B}}}T}\right)\) is the kinetic rate constant at a given temperature (prefactor k1 is a free parameter), Ea is the activation energy free parameter and [HBr] is the concentration of HBr—that is, these conversions increase with [HBr] and with temperature, do not depend on the initial concentration of the alcohol substrate and the rate-limiting step is formation of a carbocation 15c, all as expected for SN1 reaction. The isosurfaces correspond to 20%, 40%, 70% and 85% yield. c, Distribution of yields for the side product 15d. The isosurface corresponds to 20% yield. d, Pink cloud delineates a narrow region of conditions in which an anomalous outcome—that is, carbocation dimer 15e—is observed. e, Pink line is a typical UV-Vis spectrum from the region of conditions in which an anomalous outcome is observed. The dashed line is a typical experimental spectrum for which this anomaly is absent. Blue line is the ab initio theoretical absorption spectrum of 1.23 nM of 15e after summation with the dashed ‘baseline', blue band is the 1σ confidence interval (see Supplementary Information Section 6.2).

The axes of each plot are initial amine, aldehyde and isocyanide concentrations for initial concentrations of pTSA indicated above each plot. Experimental yields (after 16 h at 26 °C) of product 16e are colour-coded according to the legend in d. Only 125 interpolated conditions per cube are shown for clarity (see Supplementary Information Section 4.15 and Supplementary Video 3). Green and blue stars mark two distinct yield maxima. e–h, Corresponding yield distributions of 16e predicted by a kinetic model fitted simultaneously to all experimental data (yield isosurfaces are at 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5% and 5.0%). This model is based on a kinetic network outlined in i and further side reactions (see Supplementary Information Scheme 5). The original reaction of 16a, 16b, 16c and DMF using initiator 16d and leading to product 16e is on the yellow background. The classic Ugi mechanism is summarized by blue arrows (for details, see Supplementary Information Scheme 6). A competing oxazoline-based path (brown) was experimentally excluded (red cross). A third mechanism (magenta), potentially active at high [pTSA]0 and involving aldehyde, amine and isocyanide in a 1:1:2 ratio, did not improve model fit. The theoretical model (Supplementary Tables 19, 20, 22 and 23) comprised this entire mechanistic network of 12 reactions and 15 proton transfer steps. Best-fitted model followed the data closely while retaining pKa values (in red font) of most species within 1–2 units from literature values (black font) used as initial guess (see Supplementary Information Section 5.3). j, Experimental and modelled yield profiles at the two maxima (corners A and B in a) along [pTSA]0 confirm that yields at global/local maxima are higher than at any four-dimensional paths connecting them (see Supplementary Video 3 and Supplementary Fig. 161). Error bars correspond to 14.6% relative standard error. k, Initial concentrations at global and local maxima.

a, Identification of reaction products by closed-loop repurification and refitting against four-dimensional hypercube UV-Vis spectra (see Supplementary Information Section 4.15). Within eight repurification rounds, 16 components (14 products plus unreacted 19a and 19c) were identified. The mismatch between fitted and experimental spectra (vertical axis) decreased to the median value of instrumental uncertainty (dashed green line; see Supplementary Information Section 4.9). The vertical axis shows the highest spectral mismatch per condition. Box plot elements indicate the first quartile, median and third quartile, whiskers show the 5th and 95th percentiles, with outliers as black diamonds. Blue scatter plot shows individual data points. b, UV-Vis ‘basis set' of the 16 components. Their discovery follows the cycles in a: 3 components (19a, 19c, 19d), 7 components (+19k, 19r, 19o, 19m), 8 components (+EAB), 11 components (+19j, 19f, 19g), 12 components (+19e), 14 components (+19h, 19p), 15 components (+19i), 16 components (+19h). c, Reaction network: green, substrates; blue, isolated known products/intermediates; red, new products/intermediates. Network connectivity was verified by separate reactions (green arrows): (1) NH4OAc, AcOH, 80 °C, 18 h; (2) ethyl acetoacetate, EtOH, 80 °C, 18 h; (3) EAB, EtOH, 80 °C, 24 h. Note the presence of products of two separate ‘named reactions', Hantzsch (19d) and Petrenko-Kritschenko (19e) (mechanisms are shown in Supplementary Information Schemes 2 and 3. d–f, Within the hyperspace, the reaction network at 80 °C can be switched between three main products observed in different corners of the space: Hantzsch ester 19d (maximum yield 63.5%, <3% 19p) (d); Petrenko-Kritschenko product 19e (maximum yield about 66%) (e); benzylidene-extended Hantzsch derivative 19k (maximum yield 61.7%) (f). These yields (after 48 h) were quantified by HPLC and are colour-coded according to the legend. Isosurfaces correspond to 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% and 60% yield. For full experimental details, see Supplementary Information Sections 4.7, 4.9 and 4.10.

a, 756 PBAs, catalysts with a general formula KMB[MA(CN)6], were prepared by the robot in separate vials using the co-precipitation method. Up to two aqueous solutions of MA and up to five of MB were pipetted automatically with specified volumes to prepare the PBA catalyst suspensions, each with a final volume of 200 µl in individual vials, followed by 24 h of ageing at room temperature. b, Irrespective of the composition, these nanomaterials were particles approximately 50 nm in size. Uniformity of metal distributions was confirmed by energy-dispersive spectroscopy. For large-area scanning electron microscopy images and all experimental details, see Supplementary Information Section 8. Scale bars, 20 nm. c, Five-dimensional hyperspace of yields of styrene oxide reconstructed by spectral unmixing. d, Five-dimensional hyperspace of selectivity of styrene oxide reconstructed by spectral unmixing. e, At least five PBAs (red markers 1–5 here and black circles in the corresponding hyperspace in c) showed yield–selectivity properties better than previously studied PBAs (blue markers), as well as some other controls (grey markers: Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Fe(CN)63+, Co(CN)63− and the last one without any catalyst; see raw data in Supplementary Table 34). f, The robotically reconstructed hyperspace allowed for the identification of four products unreported in previous PBA studies of this reaction (20d, 20e, 20f and 20g shown on green backgrounds) and for the reconstruction of the reaction's mechanistic network involving four intermediates 20h, 20i, 20j and 20k. The blue fishhook arrows on species 20d indicate the electron flow to furnish aldehyde 20b (R = t-BuOO, t-BuO or HO), whereas the purple fishhook arrows on species 20k indicate the electron flow to furnish epoxide 20c (ref. 56). For the generation of radicals from tert-butyl hydroperoxide, see Supplementary Information Section 8.7.

With these capabilities, we began to explore and analyse hyperspaces of several classic reaction types differing in mechanistic complexity. In doing so, we focused on yield distributions at reaction time of several hours (that is, the situation relevant to synthetic organic practice) and on hyperspace regions featuring maximal degree of variability (as opposed to regions in which, for example, concentrations are so high that yields are all ‘saturated'; see Supplementary Fig. 121). For clarity, in Figs. 2–6, we plot only the subsets of data points, with all raw data available at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14880579).

Starting simple, we considered the spaces of the E1 elimination and SN1 substitution23,24 using, respectively, substrates 13a and 14a. The space of E1 was examined at t = 4 h for 775 conditions and that of SN1 at t = 48 h for 930 conditions. The three-dimensional yield distributions shown in Fig. 2c,d for reaction products 13b and 14b are approximately concave, steadily increasing towards the global maximum (in bimolecular SN1, there is shoulder maximum in the region in which the concentration of the limiting reagent 14a is low; see also Extended Data Fig. 2). Mathematically, the ‘steepness' of these surfaces can be quantified by the slopes of the product concentration with respect to the initial concentration of substrate(s), Dij = ∂Ci/∂C0,j—as shown in Supplementary Fig. 166, the absolute values of these slopes, |Dij| are small, at or below unity. Analysis of residuals detects no anomalies and, under all conditions, only substrates and the product are present in various proportions (for example, E1 is not accompanied by SN1 side reaction). Of note, yield data contained in the ‘cubes' allow for fitting approximate kinetic models (by time-integrating the underlying kinetic equations) and for deriving reasonable values of some kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, such as ΔH, ΔH‡ or ΔS (see caption to Fig. 2, Methods and Supplementary Information Sections 5.1 and 5.2 for derivations). Even though the data correspond to only one time point, the abundance of yield values for various substrate concentrations imposes hundreds of constraints against which a candidate model must simultaneously fit, thus limiting the acceptable parameters of the model. In the ‘A four-dimensional hyperspace' section, we will use this approach to interrogate more complex mechanisms.

Next, we revisited the SN1 reaction but with 15a used as a substrate (Fig. 3a). The main product 15b forms through the rearrangement of the carbocation 15c, and its yield distribution over the 1,085 conditions fits closely to the expected first-order kinetics (see caption to Fig. 3b). The algorithm also detects a minor anthraquinone by-product 15d congruent with the Diels–Alder reaction with singlet-state oxygen25,26 and distributed as illustrated in Fig. 3c. Most notably, analysis of residuals (Fig. 1i) provides the first example of a systematic anomaly and an unexpected outcome in a narrow region of low HBr concentrations marked in pink in Fig. 3d. This species exhibits an intensely pink colour that gradually wanes over two days (and disappears rapidly during purification attempts). Its UV-Vis spectrum (Fig. 3e) does not agree with absorption spectra of 15c or structurally similar carbocations27,28,29, but extensive analyses based on MS as well as time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations (Supplementary Information Sections 4.13 and 6.2) support assignment as a carbocation dimer 15e resulting from a reaction between 15c and 15a (with enough HBr to create 15c, but with the amount of water introduced by this HBr insufficient to quench the intermediate into 15b). To our best knowledge, dimerization of a substrate with its own derived carbocationic intermediate has only been observed under superacidic conditions at temperatures down to −50 °C (ref. 30) but never in the presence of quenching nucleophiles (here H2O and Br−) and under ambient conditions. We emphasize, however, that even with the presence of this anomaly, the hyperspace remains simple—that is, each of its constituent species features only one yield maximum—and the yield distributions of all species are slowly varying, |Dij| ≈ 1 (Supplementary Information Fig. 166), including 15e, which forms over a narrow range but in only approximately 1 nM concentration.

In search for more topologically complex hyperspaces, we turned to reactions that involve more than two substrates and are based on much more complex mechanisms. As the first case, we interrogated a four-component Ugi-type reaction from ref. 31, illustrated in Fig. 4 and chosen because of distinct UV-Vis signal of the cyclized product 16e. For this cyclization reaction, 3,234 conditions were investigated within a four-dimensional space defined by different initial concentrations of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde 16a, n-butylamine 16b and p-tosylmethyl isocyanide 16c substrates (DMF substrate was also a solvent of constant concentration), as well as p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate, pTSA 16d, acting as a reaction initiator.

The hyperspace illustrated in Fig. 4a–d and Supplementary Video 3 now reveals the presence of two distinct yield maxima for the heterocyclic product 16e—a global maximum marked by a green star and a local maximum marked by a blue star. Further sampling of the conditions' grid in the region between the maxima confirms that they are separated in four-dimensional space by a region of low yield (Fig. 4j and Supplementary Figs. 160c and 161).

Notably, MS analyses (Supplementary Information Section 4.8) evidence distinct signals at these two maxima: the local maximum gives a peak m/z ratio corresponding to the iminium ion 18c expected for the classical Ugi mechanism32,33, whereas the global maximum also features a peak attributable to the oxazoline 17e. This, in turn, may suggest an extra mechanism (brown arrows) through the oxazoline 17e intermediate—alternative mechanisms for the Ugi reaction have, indeed, been postulated for decades but never proved34,35. However, such a possibility is directly disqualified by separate, ex roboto experiments in which isolated 17e fails to give product 16e on further reaction with n-butylamine in the presence of pTSA (Supplementary Information Section 4.8.4). Although other mechanisms can also be considered (see magenta arrows in Fig. 4 and corresponding caption), fitting the experimental hyperspace data to the kinetic network of 12 reactions and 15 proton transfer steps (Fig. 4i and theoretical details in Supplementary Information Section 5.3) suggests that an excellent agreement can be achieved (Fig. 4e–h) based only on the Ugi mechanism—that is, inclusion of extra mechanisms offers no perceptible improvement. Instead, the emergence of the two maxima can be attributed to the shifts in the equilibria underlying the network (Supplementary Information Sections 5.3.4 and 5.3.5). We also note that evolution of these maxima following changes in pTSA concentration is very gradual (Supplementary Video 3) and the yield distributions are characterized by very small ‘slopes', |Dij| ≲ 1 (Supplementary Fig. 166).

Next, we considered the classic Hantzsch pyridine synthesis (Fig. 5), studied for almost 150 years (refs. 36,37,38) and interesting for several known intermediates and competing pathways (coloured in blue in Fig. 5c). Notably, examining the four-dimensional hyperspace (concentrations of the three substrates, 26 °C and 80 °C temperatures; a total of 2,582 conditions) revealed the presence of many more components than previously thought. Their isolation required several HPLC repurification cycles performed in a closed-loop manner. Specifically, after each cycle, the newly identified substances were added to the spectral unmixing algorithm and the global fits to experimental spectra from the entire hypercube gradually improved (Fig. 5a,b); meanwhile, more fractions were selected for the next round of purification if they featured yet-unassigned signals (Supplementary Information Sections 4.9 and 4.10). After eight such fitting–purification cycles, the mismatch between the fitted and experimental spectra reached instrumental noise (dashed green line in Fig. 5a), at which point our knowledge of the hyperspace composition can, for all practical reasons, be deemed nearly complete. This knowledge spans not only the seven known species36,37,38 but also nine new ones (coloured red in Fig. 5c) that have not been reported in the classical Hantzsch reaction but can be of interest in the context of biological activity39.

By considering the causal relationships between these and other species discovered within the hyperspace, it is possible to establish the synthetic connectivity of the isolated species (Supplementary Information Section 4.10). This analysis, ultimately, reconstructs the complete network of the Hantzsch reaction detailed in Fig. 5c with key steps confirmed by further ex roboto reactions (marked by green arrows). Notably, analysis of yield distributions (with the help of HPLC, as spectral unmixing of all 16 components is no longer unique) revealed that, by adjusting substrate concentrations at 80 °C, the network can be switched between three different major products (19d, 19e, 19k), each forming in >60% yield and with maxima located at different corners of the conditions' cube (Fig. 5d–f). One of these switchovers is between the Hantzsch ester (19d) and the Petrenko-Kritschenko product (19e)40, meaning that even the so-called named reactions can, in reality, be part of the same hyperspace. Another observation is that, despite the switchovers, the individual yield distributions for individual species remain smooth, as visualized by the isosurfaces in Fig. 5d–f.

Finally, we consider a hyperspace in which dimensions correspond to systematic variations in composition. Here these compositions are the contents of different metals in the Prussian blue analogues (PBAs)41 (Fig. 6), which are perovskite-type materials described by a general formula KMB[MA(CN)6] and widely studied in the context of catalysis and energy storage42. The robot surveys a five-dimensional space defined by the contents of metals at sites MA (two types, Fe and Co) and MB (five types, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) over a uniform grid with the granularity of 0.2 (for example, Mn0.2Ni0.4Cu0.4–Fe0.6Co0.4 PBA versus Mn0.2Ni0.2Cu0.6–Fe0.4Co0.6 PBA, with molar fractions at A and B sites each summing to unity). Each of the 756 PBAs is prepared in situ by straightforward co-precipitation method (Fig. 6a,b) and is used to catalyse reaction of styrene 20a and t-BuOOH to give styrene oxide 20c (given that styrene oxide is the key intermediate to synthesize many fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals43, this reaction has been the subject of several studies using various catalysts, including PBAs44,45). Figure 6c shows the distribution of reaction yields and Fig. 6d quantifies the selectivities with respect to benzaldehyde 20b, the main by-product of the reaction. As seen, the yield hyperspace is much more corrugated than concentration–temperature hyperspaces from Figs. 2–5 and features several local yield maxima. Notably, it contains several PBA compositions that offer better yield–selectivity characteristics than previously reported PBAs44,45 or other controls (Fig. 6e). As in other examples that we considered, the hyperspace reconstruction reveals the presence of unreported intermediates and by-products and helps reconstruct a mechanistic network (Fig. 6f) that had previously remained elusive44,45,46.

One of the insights from these studies is the relatively simple structure of the concentration–temperature spaces, with yield distributions of any single species featuring, at most, two yield maxima and with the slope values |Dij| at or below unity (Supplementary Fig. 166). As described in Supplementary Information Sections 7.1 and 7.2, it can be rigorously proved that, for strongly connected, directed hypergraphs47,48 (that is, those that cannot be split into non-interacting subsets of reactions) and for first-order and pseudo-first-order reactions, |Dij| ≤ 1. For higher-order kinetics of individual reactions, the theoretical upper bound on |Dij| is too high to be practically relevant, but numerical studies of networks comprising first-order and second-order steps and no cycles confirm that |Dij| is also typically on the order of unity. A corollary to this result is that, along concentration coordinates C0,j, j = 1,…,k, the hypersurfaces can be examined faithfully at sparse intervals (see Supplementary Information Section 7.6). This, in turn, can help reduce the number of experiments during conditions' screening and optimization campaigns. For more discussion of hyperspace properties (in terms of topology, differential yields and Shannon information theory), see Supplementary Figs. 161 and 162 and Supplementary Information Section 4.12.

Naturally, these considerations do not apply to hyperspaces in which compositions are varied. For instance, different catalysts (as in Fig. 6) can lower the activation barriers substantially and to different extents. As a result, they can alter the network-wide kinetics more than changes over a limited range of concentrations or temperatures, resulting in ‘steeper' concentration derivatives and in the hyperspace featuring many local yield maxima.

The method by which we reconstructed reaction networks is loosely analogous to the approaches used in electronics to reverse-engineer a circuit inside a ‘black box' by applying inputs and analysing corresponding outputs. Here the inputs are the various substrate concentrations and temperatures and the outputs are the identities of the products found by the global analysis of the hyperspace. With the set of products identified, the ‘wiring' of the network is prescribed by the general rules of chemical reactivity. In the cases studied here, the wirings could be reconstructed relatively readily by humans but, as illustrated in Supplementary Information Section 4.11, this process can also be aided by network algorithms operating either at the level of mechanistic steps4,49 or full reactions50, thereby linking the hyperspace of conditions to the ‘space of reaction grammars'5, a link argued to be key to chemical innovation5. In this effort, the broad investigation of the hyperspace is essential, as different inputs can serve to ‘activate' or ‘deactivate' different branches of the network (by modifying reaction rates and shifting equilibria), enabling the formation of as many products as possible. This also means investigating the reaction space at stoichiometries that a human chemist might not necessarily find intuitive or relevant to a particular reaction. Here this approach more than doubled the knowledge of the Hantzsch hyperspace and we have seen similar discovery enhancements in other reactions that we have studied since then (for example, Pechmann, Biginelli). From a technical point of view, our ability to interrogate entire spaces of conditions capitalizes on the use of inexpensive (cents per sample) optical detection, which reduces the need for costly (about $45–300 per sample) HPLC/quantitative NMR analyses by a factor of several hundred (for example, one HPLC/NMR cycle per 1,085 UV-Vis experiments to reconstruct the SN1 network in Fig. 3; eight closed-loop cycles to ensure complete knowledge of the Hantzsch space examined by UV-Vis at 2,582 conditions). As long as the equilibrium is not fully reached (Supplementary Figs. 154 and 160), sweeping the reaction rates through control of starting concentrations accesses the type of data similar to conventional kinetic experiments (that ‘sweep' the time to observation instead) and estimation of kinetic parameters becomes possible.

A related aspect is the practical ability to direct these reaction networks towards desired outcomes by simply adjusting concentrations (that is, without using different reagents, as done in some recent excellent papers, such as ref. 51). For simple reactions, such stoichiometric control is, of course, well known (for example, we can influence the ratio of monosubstituted to disubstituted product of alkyl dibromide by using one versus two equivalents of the nucleophile). However, for multicomponent reaction mixtures, it is less obvious that they can be pushed cleanly towards different major products. We have seen this capability realized for the Hantzsch reaction, in which the yields of major products 19d, 19e and 19k were maximized at concentration ratios very different from those we may expect based on product stoichiometry alone. For instance, product 19e incorporates one copy of substrate 19a, two copies of 19b and two copies of 19c, but in the hyperspace in Fig. 5e, the regions of appreciable yield, >40%, start from about 1:4.5:2 ratio (and continue for even higher molar excess of 19b at the yield maximum, which, however, becomes wasteful in terms of substrate use; see Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Information Section 4.17).

In conclusion, this work is an initial effort—made possible by modern reaction automation—to understand the structure of reaction hyperspaces, one of the five foundational spaces of mathematical chemistry5. It reinforces the view of chemical reactions as networks4,51,52 embedded in multidimensional spaces of conditions and, at least in some cases, switchable between different major products, which is reminiscent of some biochemical networks53,54 and promising in terms of diversity-oriented synthesis55. The rapid and cost-effective approach to hyperspace reconstruction can (1) systematize and accelerate reaction discovery and optimization and (2) foster fundamental research on reaction networks as dynamic systems. This effort can be aided by hyperspace visualization and analysis tools such as those we developed and make available at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14880579; see also Supplementary Video 4). In a broader context, inclusion of our experimental yield maps to the benchmarks used for testing the general-purpose yield optimization algorithms9,11,15 would appreciably widen the diversity of these benchmarks, given the current scarcity of such datasets7,9,13,15. In future work, we aim to extend our robotic platform to reactions that require solid dispensing and/or strictly oxygen-free conditions (this will broaden the scope of hyperspaces we can analyse), to accelerate dispensing and measuring operations (to analyse fast reactions) and also to monitor hyperspace evolution over time, which will be necessary to reconstruct highly nonlinear mechanisms (for example, oscillating reactions).

Reagent addition was carried out using a commercial pipetting module (ZEUS, Hamilton), optimized for pipetting a range of organic solvents in aliquots ranging from 10 µl to 1 ml, with volumetric errors of less than 1% for volumes greater than 50 µl and less than 2% for volumes between 10 and 50 µl. Liquids were dispensed into 2-ml glass vials arranged in custom-designed 54-well plates, with each reaction typically set to a final volume of 500 µl. Following reagent addition, vials were hermetically sealed using a flat lid, with a rubber sheet and perfluoroalkoxy film placed between the lid and the vial. Initial mixing was performed on an orbital shaker at 250 rpm for 5 min. Subsequent stirring is omitted, as separate studies (see Supplementary Information Sections 2.9 and 4.5) have shown that, for vials of these dimensions, passive mixing over the course of the reaction (hours) is as efficient as mechanical stirring, thereby eliminating the need for cumbersome stir bars.

After reactions were run for desired times, the crude mixture from each vial was, if necessary, automatically diluted to align with the detection range of the UV-Vis spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The operation of the spectrophotometer was also automated, including lid opening and closing, along with the flushing and drying of the measuring pedestal (see Supplementary Video 2). All of these operations were orchestrated by house-written software. The entire assembly was placed inside a hood and, if needed, constantly purged with nitrogen. The manual operations in the entire workflow were changing the 54-well plates, covering them with rubber/perfluoroalkoxy sheets and placing on the orbital shaker. For some hyperspaces, two such systems were used. Further technical details and the blueprints for system replication are provided in Supplementary Information Section 2 and at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14880579)57. The software design is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 2 and the source code is deposited at https://github.com/yaroslavsobolev/robowski-maps.

The full cubes of 775 E1 conditions (five temperatures, 16–36 °C; five initial substrate concentrations, 1.5–15.0 mM; 31 HBr concentrations, 0.1–10.0 mM; reaction time: 4 h) and 930 SN1 conditions (six temperatures; 16–66 °C; five 9-butyl-9H-fluoren-9-ol substrate concentrations, 0.03–0.30 M; 31 HBr concentrations; reaction time: 48 h) are provided in Supplementary Information Section 4.15, with all raw data in the Zenodo repository.

Stoichiometry constraints, as shown in Fig. 1e, were included into the spectral unmixing algorithm by modifying the log-likelihood function L to be minimized: L is a sum of squared spectral mismatch (yellow) of experimental Ameasured(λ) and modelled Amodel(λ) absorbances, divided by the instrumental variance of the spectrophotometer σ2(λ, Ameasured(λ)), and the term representing the violation of stoichiometric inequalities (red) containing the Heaviside function θ(x) and the experimental uncertainties \({\sigma }_{{[{\rm{A}}]}_{0}}\) and \({\sigma }_{{[{\rm{B}}]}_{0}}\) of preparing the reaction mixture with given starting concentrations. See Supplementary Information Section 3 for more details about the spectral unmixing algorithm

The isosurfaces in Figs. 2–5 were extracted by the marching cubes algorithm58 operating on a 50 × 50 × 50 regular grid obtained through the radial basis functions interpolator applied to the raw data. This method was implemented in the HyperspaceViewer software, which is provided in the Supplementary Information and is open-sourced at a GitLab repository (https://gitlab.com/az-steak/hyperspace_viewer).

The kinetic fitting in Fig. 2e,f was done by numerically integrating the equations of the mechanism and optimizing the parameters to achieve the best-fit of the model's predicted product yields simultaneously to all experimental data. This procedure gave reasonable estimates of the reactions' thermodynamic parameters: ΔH = −30.7 ± 1.4 kJ mol−1 for SN1 and \(\Delta H={81.98}_{-1.64}^{+3.52}\,{\rm{kJ}}\,{{\rm{mol}}}^{-1}\), \(\Delta S={273.8}_{-4.9}^{+10.8}\,{\rm{J}}\,{{\rm{mol}}}^{-1}\,{{\rm{K}}}^{-1}\) and \({\Delta H}^{\ddagger }={21.10}_{-0.49}^{+0.33}\,{\rm{kJ}}\,{{\rm{mol}}}^{-1}\) (transition state enthalpy) for E1. For derivations of these values and comparisons against related literature examples, see Supplementary Information Sections 5.1 and 5.2.

Initial guess of kinetic parameters (Fig. 4e–h) was provided by the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm59, kinetic equations at each condition were integrated numerically and the discrepancy against the experimental yield distribution (over the hyperspace) was minimized using the trust region reflective algorithm60. See Supplementary Information Section 5.3 for further details of the kinetic model.

PBAs were synthesized following a reported co-precipitation method61. Two stock solutions containing metal MA (Fe, Co) were prepared by dissolving K3[Fe(CN)6] or K3[Co(CN)6] in deionized water to form clear solutions of type A (0.10 M). Five stock solutions containing metal MB (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) were prepared separately by dissolving corresponding metal nitrates/chlorides (Mn(NO3)2, FeCl2, Co(NO3)2, Ni(NO3)2, Cu(NO3)2, each at 0.10 M) in the presence of trisodium citrate dihydrate (Na3C6H5O7·2H2O, 0.1125 M) in deionized water to form clear solutions of type B. Afterwards, mixing of solutions of type A and type B were performed in specified volume ratios using the automated liquid-handling system according to the target composition. For instance, for a PBA with composition Mn0.2Ni0.4Cu0.4–Fe0.6Co0.4, the sequence and volume of stock solution addition were as follows: 20 μl Mn(NO3)2, 40 μl Ni(NO3)2, 40 μl Cu(NO3)2, 60 μl K3[Fe(CN)6] and 40 μl K3[Co(CN)6]. The total volume of solutions of type A was 100 μl and the total volume of solutions of type B was also 100 μl—therefore, the total volume of each PBA solution was always 200 μl. After sealing, each 54-vial well plate housing different mixed solutions was shaken for 15 min (250 rpm) and aged at room temperature for 24 h to form PBAs.

For a typical set of styrene epoxidation reactions, the reaction stock solution was prepared as follows: first, styrene (0.50 M) and tert-butyl hydrogen peroxide (0.75 M) were dissolved in 100 ml acetonitrile. Then, 30 ml cetyltrimethylammonium bromide aqueous solution (0.25 M) was added to the mixture. Subsequently, the obtained mixture was sonicated for 5 min to obtain a homogeneous stock solution. Afterwards, the robotic system pipetted 1.3-ml aliquots of the thus prepared stock solution into the vials containing previously prepared PBAs (200 µl aqueous suspension). The reaction vials were then sealed and every reaction plate was placed on a thermal shaker (72 °C, 700 rpm) for 6 h. After reaction, when the PBAs sedimented, the robot acquired 40 µl of the supernatant from every vial, diluted it 1,000 times and then measured the UV-Vis spectrum with the NanoDrop spectrophotometer. The yield of styrene oxide (yso) and benzaldehyde (yalde) for each sample can be obtained by spectral unmixing and the selectivity of styrene, calculated by yso/(yso + yalde) × 100%, was then obtained.

a, Examples of reactions compatible (green background), borderline (yellow) and incompatible (pink) with yield determination using UV-Vis and spectral unmixing. The compatible reactions include but are not limited to Claisen–Schmidt condensation 1, Ullmann-type coupling 2, Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling 3, Cu(I)-catalysed alkyne-azide cycloaddition 4, Friedel–Crafts acylation 5, imine condensation 6, Glaser-type coupling 7 or Beckmann rearrangement 8. The Diels–Alder reaction 9 shown on yellow background is borderline in terms of the quality of unmixing (the overlap of the UV-Vis signals from the product and from dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate prevents accurate fitting, leading to an overestimation of the yield). For the Diels–Alder reaction 10 shown on red background, the band of the product (λmax < 286 nm) is obscured by the toluene solvent (λmax = 286 nm). Other reactions unsuitable for the method are, for example, SN2 reaction of alkyl bromide 11 (not absorbing above 220 nm) or condensation of dichlorodiaminobenzene with phenanthrenequinone 12 (poor solubility of the product). b, R2 = 0.96 correlation between the optically determined yields versus the yields of the same reactions determined by conventional means (HPLC for E1 from Fig. 3 and Ugi-type MCR from Fig. 4; 1H NMR for Claisen–Schmidt condensation 1 and imine condensation 6; the weights of isolated compounds for Cu(I)-catalysed alkyne-azide cycloaddition 4 and Beckmann rearrangement 8). For numerical values of each data point, see Supplementary Tables 5–7 in Supplementary Information Sections 4.3 and 4.4.

a, Taking as an example a basic bimolecular reaction A + B → C (with kinetic rate k[A][B], reaction time t = 1 and kinetic constant k = 1), the plot has the yield and concentration of C for various combinations of A and B substrates. b, The plot shows the yield surface explicitly (black curve is the boundary at which the limiting reactant switches from A to B). As seen, yield—defined with respect to the concentration of the limiting reagent—tends to maximize at the boundaries of the region (orange curve in a) but the concentration of the product tends to maximize in its interior (blue curve in a). There are two implications of this ‘inverse' dependence: (1) yields at very low concentrations may be artificially high, whereas—in reality—they involve very high (wasteful) excesses of some reagents; (2) detecting and quantifying the product reliably may be compromised in such a low-concentration regime. Accordingly, in the current work—especially for the multicomponent mixtures—we have worked over concentration ranges that do not extend to very small values, thereby assuring reliable detection while avoiding highly wasteful excess ratios. Such a ‘practical' range is shown schematically in a by the dashed vertical lines. Another corollary is that discovery of unexpected products may be severely compromised when using a strategy of investigating only the edges and boundaries of an n-dimensional region while leaving the interior unexplored—a strategy that may otherwise seem intuitive to a chemist and has some merit in maximization of the yield of known products. c,d, Comparison of final concentration map (c) to yield map (d) for product 19e in Hantzsch reaction. Note the difference between the conditions that maximize concentration versus ones that maximize yield: yield is maximized at the vertices of the cube, whereas concentration is maximized in the middle of the front face and top edge, with higher concentrations protruding deeper into the interior of the cube (see blue curve in a). The isosurfaces correspond to 5 mM, 10 mM, 15 mM, 20 mM, 25 mM and 30 mM concentrations of 19e in c, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% and 60% yields of 19e in d and are calculated as explained in the caption of Fig. 2c,d.

Among the many types of qubit presently being investigated for a future quantum computer, silicon spin qubits with millions of qubits on a single chip are uniquely positioned to enable quantum computing. However, it has not been clear whether the outstanding high-fidelity operations and long coherence times shown by silicon spin qubits fabricated in academic settings1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 can be reliably reproduced when the qubits are manufactured in a semiconductor foundry9,10,11. Here we show precise qubit operation of silicon two-qubit devices made with standard semiconductor tooling in a 300-mm foundry environment. Of the key metrics, single- and two-qubit control fidelities exceed 99% for all four devices, and the state preparation and measurement fidelities reach up to 99.9%, as evidenced by gate set tomography. We report spin lifetime and coherence up to T1 = 9.5 s, \({T}_{2}^{* }=40.6\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\) and \({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}=1.9\,{\rm{ms}}\). We determine that residual nuclear spin-carrying isotopes contribute substantially to operational errors, identifying further isotopic purification as a clear pathway to even higher performance.

The early academic successes of silicon spin-qubit technology1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 created enthusiasm for the idea that these qubits could be fabricated in industrial 300-mm manufacturing lines9,10,11,12. Potential advantages include the ability to leverage advanced fabrication processes, to integrate qubits with modern electronics and to benefit from the existing capabilities of mass manufacturing at low costs12. Over the past decade, there have been a number of proposals for potential architectures that could be used to realize a scalable quantum computer based on silicon spin qubits13,14,15,16,17.

However, recent attempts to fabricate spins-in-silicon quantum dots using industrial-scale fabrication has raised awareness about the material challenges that must be faced. For example, it is crucial to reduce the charge noise and static disorder arising due to defects and traps at interfaces and oxides18,19,20. High-fidelity single-qubit operations can be performed with minimal impact from charge noise because the electron spin couples to the noisy electric fields only through its weak spin–orbit effects21,22,23,24,25. By contrast, other operations, including qubit initialization, read-out and exchange-based two-qubit gates, are more sensitive to the charge noise present in conventional metal–oxide–semiconductor gate stacks19,24.

This sensitivity has motivated the search for ways of mitigating the effects of charge noise, including moving spin states away from the interface to quantum wells26,27. However, from a scaling perspective, it is desirable to reconcile as much as possible conventional complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) processes with qubit fabrication to leverage the mature CMOS industry to the fullest extent. Moreover, the formation of quantum dots against thin oxides has several benefits, such as a large electric field that leads to large valley splitting18,28,29 and efficient electrostatic coupling between the gate voltage bias and the channel, allowing for well-isolated states, efficient exchange coupling control29 and fast gate-based read-out30.

In this work, we study four two-qubit devices fabricated using a long-established CMOS geometry, namely a planar metal–oxide–semiconductor with polysilicon gates31. We demonstrate for all devices all basic qubit operations, including one- and two-qubit gates, initialization and read-out, with error rates approaching and surpassing the fault-tolerance threshold for the widely studied surface error correction code32. We obtain these error rates using state-of-the-art gate set tomography (GST) tools33,34, allowing us to pinpoint effects such as crosstalk and the breakdown between stochastic and coherent errors. Our studies indicate unprecedented reproducible low error levels while also identifying clear pathways to further reducing errors.

The qubit devices were designed by Diraq and fabricated at imec in a 300-mm spin-qubit process flow that is described in Methods. The resulting wafer consists of several devices covering a range of feature sizes and configurations. We chose the design that we estimated would have optimal device parameters, and we tested four of these devices (denoted A–D). The design consists of a double quantum dot and a nearby single-electron transistor (SET) for spin read-out1 (Fig. 1a).

a, Schematic of a Diraq two-qubit device fabricated on a 300-mm wafer, showing the full wafer, single die and single device level. b, Charge stability diagram of device A as a function of plunger (P1 and P2) voltage detuning ΔVP = ΔVP1 = −ΔVP2 and exchange gate (J) voltage VJ, showing four isolated electrons in the double-dot system. Devices B–D were also measured in the (3,1) charge configuration and showed analogous charge stability diagrams. Voltage points for single-qubit operation (Joff < 1 kHz), two-qubit operation (Jon ≈ 1 MHz) and read-out are shown as a triangle, inverted triangle and star, respectively. The faint charge transition starting from VJ = 1.05 V is very weakly coupled to the quantum dot and probably corresponds to charge movement outside the active dot confinement area. In device D, we observed similar charge movements outside the active dot region; devices B and C showed none. Inset, Cross section of the double-quantum-dot device indicating the number of electrons under the plunger gates (P1 and P2), exchange gate (J) and double potential well. Scale bars, 100 nm (a, top), 10 mm (a, middle), 300 mm (a, bottom). a.u., arbitrary units.

We operated the devices in a 3He/4He dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of 10 mK in isolated mode, with four electrons in the double dot formed under the plunger gate electrodes (P1 and P2). A voltage applied to an interstitial exchange gate (J) controlled the tunnel coupling between the dots1,35,36. The electrons were loaded from a two-dimensional electron gas formed under the reservoir gate, which overlaps with an n++ implanted ohmic region. The Pauli spin blockade at the (3,1)–(4,0) charge transition was used for spin parity read-out and the signal was measured using the SET in d.c. mode (Fig. 1b). SET charge-noise measurements reveal a 1/fα power spectral density with α between 0.50(7) and 1.19(5) and an amplitude of 0.79(4)–\(0.98(7)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{eV}}/\sqrt{{\rm{Hz}}}\) at 1 Hz (Extended Data Fig. 1), in line with previous low charge-noise results from devices fabricated using similar methods19,21.

A static magnetic field B0 in the range 0.662–0.7 T split the spin states to form the single-qubit states, which were manipulated with on-resonance microwave signals applied to the electron spin resonance antenna with frequency fESR. Single-qubit Xπ/2 gates were formed with timed microwave pulses on resonance with the qubit Larmor frequencies fL,Q1 and fL,Q2 (Fig. 2), whereas Zπ/2 gates were implemented as virtual gates through rotations of the reference frame37. The single-qubit metrics, including spin lifetime and Ramsey and Hahn coherence times, for the four devices are shown in Table 1.

Probability of reading out an even or blockaded spin state Peven, when applying microwave signal at the frequency fESR – fLO for a duration of tESR. c,d, Coherent Rabi oscillations at fL,Qi for qubits 1 (c) and 2 (d). Real-time feedback is implemented to counteract the Larmor frequency deviation39. The local oscillator frequency is set to fLO = 18.610 GHz. The microwave power applied to qubit 1 is approximately 7% larger than that to qubit 2 resulting in matching Rabi frequencies of fRabi = 658.6(3) kHz.

Figure 3 details our implementation of two-qubit control. A voltage pulse, typically of duration tCZ between 100 ns and 500 ns, was applied to the J gate to control the exchange interaction strength (Fig. 3a–c). We performed the two-qubit gate at the symmetric charge operation point to reduce the sensitivity to the detuning noise38 (Fig. 3d). We extracted from the fitted exchange frequencies in Fig. 3c an exchange controllability of 18.4 dec V−1 (devices A–D are compared in Fig. 3e). By combining a pulsed exchange interaction with single-qubit phase rotations, we were able to implement a controlled-Z (CZ) two-qubit gate1 (Fig. 3f,g). Using real-time feedback, we tracked and corrected the SET voltage operation point and the single-qubit Larmor and Rabi frequencies39 (see Extended Data Fig. 3 for details). We used a heralded initialization protocol to check if the qubit system was successfully initialized in the \(| \downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) state, and we repeated the initialization if unsuccessful7,40.

a,b, Probability of detecting an even spin state Peven after a microwave burst of fixed power and duration at different J gate voltages VJ when preparing a mixed odd state of \(| \downarrow \uparrow \rangle \) and \(| \uparrow \downarrow \rangle \) (a) and a pure even state \(| \downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) (b). The power and duration of the microwave burst are roughly calibrated to a single-qubit π rotation. The local oscillator frequency is set to fLO = 18.610 GHz. The mixed odd state is initialized with a tramp = 1 μs ramp at VJ = 0.96 V over the anti-crossing and the even state with heralded initialization based on a tramp = 1 μs ramp at VJ = 1.12 V. All experiments throughout the paper were conducted with an even state \(| \downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) initialization, unless otherwise specified. c, Controlled phase (CZ) oscillation as a function of exchange time texchange and exchange gate voltage VJ. We apply dynamical decoupling by a consecutive π rotation on both qubits to filter out other phase-accumulating effects, such as Stark shift. d, Decoupled exchange oscillation fingerprint for fixed exchange time texchange = 10 μs as a function of plunger voltage detuning ΔVP and exchange gate voltage VJ. The triangle indicates the exchange gate voltage used for the CZ gate. e, Exchange strength as a function of exchange gate voltage extracted from fitting exchange oscillations in c. The controllability is fitted assuming Jexchange ∝ a exp bVJ, resulting in a range between b = 9.78 dec V−1 and 18.44 dec V−1 across devices A–D. The variation in exchange controllability across the devices is probably due to fabrication variability. f,g, Calibration of the CZ single-qubit phase correction by preparing the target spin in superposition, applying a CPHASE followed by a virtual phase rotation for qubits 1 (f) and 2 (g)4,7. Vertical lines indicate the phase values for which the spin state of Q1 (Q2) is flipped if Q2 (Q1) is in the on/spin-up state. The read-out probability is unscaled in all data.

To precisely capture errors in qubit operation, we designed a GST experiment comprising the full gate set {II, XI, IX, ZI, IZ, CZ}, from which we constructed a list of ‘preparation' and ‘measurement fiducials' circuits. Combining these fiducials with ‘germ' circuits up to length 16, we obtained a list of 12,263 unique sequences34. We chose GST as the benchmarking method because it yields the error taxonomy with specific error channels and is generally a higher bar for fidelities than the more commonly used interleaved randomized benchmarking, which often overestimates fidelities8.

We implemented an idle gate with a total idle time equal to the duration of a CZ gate. Single-qubit gates in the two-qubit context were achieved by rotating one qubit π/2 around the \(\widehat{x}\) axes (XI and IX) and \(\widehat{z}\) axes (ZI and IZ), while the other qubit was idling. The XI and IX gates were implemented by applying a microwave square pulse of around 400 ns, including a 20-ns smooth sine ramp, at fL,Q1 and fL,Q2 for qubits 1 and 2, respectively. The ZI and IZ gates were implemented by virtually rotating the reference frame for qubits 1 and 2, respectively. The entangling two-qubit CZ gate was implemented by applying a voltage pulse to the exchange gate J for a duration of tCZ.

Figure 4 breaks down the error generators and their contribution to the infidelity for each gate and device. Across all four devices operation accuracies are above 99%. For example, for device A, the gate fidelities are 99.45(5)%, 99.55(4)%, 99.95(4)%, 99.96(4)%, 99.74(9)% and 99.37(5)% for the XI, IX, ZI, IZ, II and CZ, respectively (see first row of Table 1). The combined state preparation and measurement (SPAM) fidelity even exceeds 99.9% with FSPAM = 99.95(8)%, which is one of the highest reported values for industrially fabricated spin qubits (Extended Data Fig. 4). Single-qubit on-target gate fidelities FX,Q1 = 99.97(15)% and FX,Q2 = 99.81(11)% are comparable to previously reported values for devices made using the same fabrication processes21.

a–d, Infidelity contributions of Hamiltonian and stochastic error generators across all four devices for the XI (a), IX (b), II (c) and CZ (d) gates from GST. Hamiltonian errors contribute to the infidelity in second order, whereas stochastic errors contribute in first order. Stochastic errors, particularly the idling ZI and IZ error generator components, dominate the infidelity by more than an order of magnitude. All gate fidelities across all devices are above 99%. Error bars represent the 95% confidence level. For visibility, only those of the IZ and ZI error generators are displayed.

All four devices have fidelities of 99% or higher across all operations, with XI (IX), ZI (IZ) and CZ gates ranging between 99.23(3)% and 99.59(15)% (99.18(5)% and 99.64(3)%), between 99.95(5)% and 99.97(3)% (99.95(5)% and 99.97(3)%) and between 99.04(16)% and 99.56(6)% (Table 1). Furthermore, the stochastic IZ and ZI error generators dominate the infidelity contributions across all devices. In particular, the stochastic IZ component is larger for the CZ gate compared with the I gate, which is probably related to the (3,1) charge configuration used in all devices. In future work, a systematic study of the (1,3) charge configuration, as well as higher electron occupations such as (3,3) across several devices, would provide valuable insights into the physical origin of the observed error mechanisms. SPAM fidelities reproducibly exceed 99.9% for three out of the four devices (devices A, C and D). For device B, we achieved a SPAM fidelity of 99.33(9)%. We attribute this slightly reduced SPAM fidelity to signs of gate leakage between the SET barrier and the ohmic contacts. Similarly, device D shows leakage between the SET barrier and the plunger gate used to form qubit 2, which is the probable cause of the reduced spin relaxation and coherence time of qubit 2 (Table 1).

Additionally, we performed d.c. cryo-probing measurements on a further 16 devices: one with the same design parameters as devices A–D and 15 with different design parameters, all from the same imec wafer. These measurements indicate excellent uniform electrostatic control over all device gate electrodes (Extended Data Fig. 5).

Device A exemplifies the high performance of qubits on the 300-mm wafer and can, therefore, be used as a case study to examine the sources of infidelity. In the following sections, we analyse the GST error contributions and their probable physical origins in device A, as well as its qubit performance as a function of magnetic field. Based on the consistency of the dominating errors reported in Fig. 4 and the similarity of the Larmor frequency dynamics in Extended Data Fig. 3, we expect this conclusion to hold for all four devices.

The ZI and IZ gates were implemented virtually and are, therefore, in principle error-free. However, the clock update on the field-programmable gate array took a finite time, leading to slight imperfections in these virtual operations due to idling errors. Hence, we attribute their infidelities, 0.05(4)% (0.04(4)%) for ZI (IZ), to a small time delay in the control hardware.

Most importantly, the largest contribution to infidelity for the XI, II and CZ gates is the stochastic IZ error generator, whereas the IX gate is limited by the stochastic ZI error generator, with the second highest contribution being the stochastic IZ error generator, followed by the stochastic IY error generator (Fig. 4). The stochastic dephasing error generator of the qubit undergoing a π/2 rotation (ZI for the XI gate and IZ for the IX gate) is significantly larger for the IX gate than for the XI gate. However, for the idle qubit (IZ for the XI gate and ZI for the IX gate), it is significantly larger for the XI gate than for the IX gate. Similarly, the infidelity contribution to the II gate from the stochastic dephasing error generator IZ (0.15%) is larger than for ZI (0.09%).

First, these error contributions could be explained by the coupling of 29Si nuclear spins to the electron spin state of qubit 2 (ref. 41). Qubit 1 also experiences quasi-static changes in the Larmor frequency, but these are of lower magnitude, despite the Stark shifts of qubit 1 being larger (Extended Data Fig. 3). This is another indication that hyperfine-coupled residual 29Si nuclear spins are the origin of that noise. As expected, these idling errors are roughly doubled (tXI = tIX = 400 ns) in comparison with the idling gate, which only takes around half the time. Comparing the II gate with the CZ gate, the stochastic ZI error generator remains constant (0.09%), but the IZ error generator more than doubles (0.40%), despite both gates having the same duration tII = tCZ = 212 ns. However, during CZ gate operation, the tunable exchange barrier is lowered to enable the Heisenberg exchange. This leads to a shift in the centre of the electron wavefunction, possibly moving qubit 2 closer to the 29Si nuclear spin, thus increasing the contact hyperfine interaction and the quasi-static noise in IZ.

Second, it might seem contradictory that the gate infidelity is dominated by noise in qubit 2, given that \({T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}} > {T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}1}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\) and \({T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}2}^{* }\approx {T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}1}^{* }\). However, the GST experiments are designed to amplify, not echo out, persistent noise sources. They are, therefore, heavily affected by slow noise, such as Larmor frequency changes arising from hyperfine-coupled nuclear spins. On the other hand, Hahn echo experiments are limited by fast charge noise. The Larmor frequency variation, tracked during the GST experiment using real-time feedback39,40, shows a higher standard deviation for the qubit 2 frequency variation compared with qubit 1 (Extended Data Fig. 3). Furthermore, the infidelities of the XI, IX, II and CZ gates decrease for higher Larmor feedback rates, with the main contribution again being the stochastic IZ error generator for the XI, II and CZ and the stochastic ZI error generators for the IX gate (Extended Data Fig. 6).

Third, sequences between which the Larmor frequency feedback exhibits a large frequency change can be removed from the GST dataset, but this has a significant effect only on the stochastic IZ error generator of the XI gate (Extended Data Fig. 7). Moreover, the spread of the Larmor frequency is independent of B0, whereas the Stark shift increases linearly (Extended Data Figs. 8 and 9) and the spin–orbit interaction in qubit 1 is stronger compared with qubit 2, as can be seen in Fig. 3a,b. The standard deviation of the Larmor frequency feedback increases in a step-like manner as a function of total experiment runtime for distinct instances across all magnetic fields (Extended Data Fig. 10). Hence, these slow timescale jumps probably originate from qubit 2 coupling strongly to the nuclear spin states of the residual 29Si atoms. As such, they contribute significantly to the gate infidelities and are the cause of the above-described observations2,42,43. These slow jumps in the Larmor frequency do not contribute to \({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\) and, therefore, do not contradict \({T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}} > {T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}1}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\).

In terms of qubit device performance, Fig. 5 shows spin lifetime and coherence metrics as functions of the magnetic field B0. T1 and \({T}_{2}^{* }\) first increase up to B0 = 0.3–0.4 T, followed by a decrease for larger B0. Because \({T}_{2}^{* }\) is sensitive to d.c. noise, it samples 1/f noise down to frequencies corresponding to the total time of the experiment, which renders it a bad metric for comparing different qubits or qubit platforms. Including Larmor frequency feedback in the experiment reduces the contribution of low-frequency 1/f noise44. We demonstrate this in Extended Data Fig. 11a,b by plotting \({T}_{2}^{* }\) as a function of the cumulative measurement time. Most curves are approximately flat, showing the effectiveness of the feedback mechanism. Extended Data Fig. 11c,d show the variation of \({T}_{2}^{* }\) as a function of laboratory time.

a–c, Spin lifetime T1 (a), Ramsey \({T}_{2}^{* }\) (b) and Hahn echo \({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\) (c) metrics as functions of the applied magnetic field amplitude B0. We measured both qubits for each experiment interleaved and repeated this 50 (T1), 10,000 (\({T}_{2}^{* }\)) and 2,000 (\({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\)) times. Ramsey experiments at B0 = 0.05 T, 0.1 T, 0.8 T and 1.1 T were repeated 50,000, 100,000, 50,000 and 40,000 times. The Hahn echo experiment at B0 = 1.3 T was repeated 500 times. Between each repeat we used real-time Larmor frequency feedback following the protocol described in ref. 39. The data were fitted using the functions described in Extended Data Fig. 2. Data shown as stars correspond to metrics measured during two-qubit benchmarking (Extended Data Fig. 2), using a method and gate voltages that differed from those used for the magnetic field sweep. Error bars represent the 95% confidence level.

The longest measured coherence times for device A include Hahn echo coherence time \({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}=\text{1,900}\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\) (1,805 μs) for qubit 2 (qubit 1) measured at the low magnetic field of B0 = 50 mT, as well as \({T}_{2}^{* }\) = 40.6 μs (39.0 μs) and T1 = 9.5 s (4.7 s). The long \({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\) and its small variation between both qubits indicate that magnetic noise dominates at low fields. On increasing B0, the Stark shift increases linearly (Extended Data Fig. 9), with steeper slopes for qubit 1 (ΔΩStark(P1, J, P2) = (−19.9(4), 31.3(3), 14.2(4)) MHz V−1 T−1) than for qubit 2 ((0, 3.2(2), 16.7(4)) MHz V−1 T−1), manifesting in stronger coupling to charge noise through the spin–orbit interaction and resulting in reduced coherence, with a 33% larger \({T}_{2,Q2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}=617(26)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\) (\({T}_{2,Q1}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}=464(22)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\)) at B0 = 1.3 T. The observed Stark shift is entirely caused by the intrinsic spin–orbit coupling of silicon electrons confined at the Si/SiO2 interface. For device A, the external magnetic field points in the [110] lattice orientation, where the variability of the g factor is highest and the Dresselhaus spin–orbit component dominates. This type of spin–orbit coupling is largely influenced by atomistic roughness at the Si/SiO2 interface29. In the presence of a gate bias, the quantum dot moves under the rough interface, shifting its g factor. The magnitude and sign of the resulting Stark shift depends on the direction in which the gate moves the quantum dot. Typical values range between −80 MHz V−1 T−1 to 80 MHz V−1 T−1 (ref. 25). In device A, we obtained −20 MHz V−1 T−1 to 30 MHz V−1 T−1, which falls within that range. The magnetic field dynamics of the spin coherence times are distinct from previous results for academic devices7, and the exact physical origin requires a more detailed study, which is beyond the scope of this work.

Looking forward, the increase in \({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\) for low fields is extremely encouraging because it indicates that the qubits are amenable to more scalable control techniques. Such approaches continuously drive the spin by using a modulated microwave field to decouple it from noise and eliminate free precession (\({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\gg {T}_{2}^{* }\))36,45. Operation at lower fields requires a different modality of the two-qubit gate. To achieve similarly fast gates, a SWAP-like operation will be implemented. Furthermore, at low fields an always-on, global control is beneficial for avoiding idling errors and using the long decoupling times \({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\gg {T}_{2}^{* }\) observed. This can be achieved by aligning the magnetic field direction such that the Larmor frequencies of the qubits become degenerate45. The key challenge for that operation modality is sufficiently large Stark shifts.

Our chosen implementation of an entangling gate (CZ) is faster than decoupling schemes, but it relies on the exchange interaction being smaller than the Zeeman energy difference of the two qubits (Jexc ≪ ΔEZ). We chose B0 values in the range 0.662–0.7 T to meet this requirement, but in future, we intend to explore other two-qubit gate implementations8.

We have demonstrated high-fidelity control of semiconductor qubits industrially manufactured in a 300-mm pilot line. In contrast to previous publications in which charge noise is identified as the key limiting factor3,4,5,8,38,46,47, our results are strongly encouraging from a noise-analysis perspective, both in terms of the fidelity values themselves, and in view of the clear pathway they pave towards further improvement through further nuclear purification. Further isotopic enrichment of the 400-ppm 29Si used in this work to levels at or below 50 ppm has already been demonstrated in academic prototype devices7. This is consistent with previous results showing the effect of nuclear spin noise on coherence times in Si/SiGe quantum-dot spin qubits20.

We have shown that using engineering practices in an industrial setting can lead to state-of-the-art spin-qubit performance when coupled with a systematic search for target performance metrics. It is crucial to understand the connection between qubit performance and measurements that can be performed during the fabrication process, such as electrical noise and Hall bar transport19,48. These investigations are in their infancy and will require an increasingly accurate model of the quantum behaviour of electrons in semiconductor devices.

In the long term, further improvements will be required on the qubit front, for which our noise analysis provides a first-order angle of attack. To reduce the overhead for fault-tolerant quantum computing32, 99.9% fidelities across all operations is a realistic target.

At this stage, a statistical analysis of these qubits at a larger scale is not yet available. The consistent calibration of qubits at the level demonstrated here remains an intensive manual process with a number of scientific insights gained along the way. Automation of this process needs to mature to consistently achieve these results in a mass-characterization campaign49. Having silicon–metal–oxide–semiconductor (SiMOS) qubits fabricated in a foundry environment readily available will facilitate the future demonstration of large-scale SiMOS qubit arrays. This has so far been challenging for SiMOS spin qubits because it has been difficult to fabricate devices with small gate pitches and low charge-noise interfaces.

These results could be leveraged to design quantum error correction strategies to cater to the specific demands of spin qubits. However, further studies will be needed to characterize qubit operations in a more scalable setting, such as under a single global microwave field and under elevated temperatures, which will inevitably be imposed by the heat dissipated by the co-integrated control electronics on the CMOS chip50,51,52. Our reproducible demonstrations of high-quality qubit operation made using 300-mm foundry processes offer a proof of principle that should encourage further industrial research into far more complex technologies that are at the disposal of foundries.

The fabrication method used at imec was optimized for low charge noise, high uniformity19,31,53,54 and qubit-specific integration with a gate pitch smaller than 100 nm. Fast fabrication cycles and design flexibility were ensured by optimally combining optical lithography and electron-beam lithography. Fabrication started with the epitaxial growth of an isotopically enriched layer of silicon with a residual concentration of 400 ppm 29Si. A high-quality thermally grown oxide forms the Si/SiO2 interface at which the charge of the electron spin qubit accumulates. Dedicated cleaning processes and 300-mm pilot line process control are key to the development of the high-quality interface19. Next, a triple-layer overlapping polysilicon gate stack was formed using electron-beam lithography and dry etching, with each gate separated by a thin interstitial high-temperature oxide deposit19. The highly doped polysilicon gates reduced the interface strain at cryogenic temperatures54,55. Finally, an aluminium strip line was patterned so that single spin states could be manipulated using electron spin resonance, offering a control solution at the few-qubit level50,52 (Extended Data Fig. 12).

Devices A, B, C and D were measured in Bluefors XLD400, Bluefors LD400, and two different Oxford Instruments K100 Kelvinox dilution refrigerators, respectively, and mounted on the cold finger. Previous work conducted with similar experimental set-ups indicates that the electron temperature was 200–300 mK (ref. 56). An American Magnetics AMI430 supplied static external magnetic fields to devices A, B and C, with the field for A pointing in the [110] direction of the Si lattice and those for B and C pointing in the [1\(\overline{1}\)0] direction. The field for device D was supplied by an Oxford Instruments IPS120-10 pointing in the [1\(\overline{1}\)0] direction of the Si lattice.

We used a Q-Devil QDAC-II to supply d.c. voltages through filtered lines with a bandwidth of up to 20 Hz. Dynamic voltage pulses were generated with a field-programmable gate array, in this experiment the Quantum Machines Operator-X+ (OPX+). The pulses were combined with d.c. biases using custom linear bias combiners at room temperature. The OPX+ had a sampling time of 1 ns.

The dynamic pulse lines in the fridge had a bandwidth of up to 50 MHz, which translated into a minimum rise time of 20 ns. We accounted for this by smoothing out fast a.c. pulsing. Microwave pulses were generated by a vector signal generator (PSG8267D, Keysight). The in-phase and quadrature and pulse modulation waveforms were generated by the OPX+.

The charge sensor comprised a single-island SET in d.c. mode. The SET current integrated for tint = 100 μs was amplified using a room-temperature I–V converter (Basel SP983c) and sampled by the OPX+. At this stage, we used d.c. mode read-out, which was limited by the bandwidth and noise of the room-temperature transimpedance amplifier, leaving high-bandwidth cryogenic current amplification for future work.

Gate times were optimized based on a trade-off between speed and lifetime. The magnetic field amplitude B0 was chosen in the range 0.662–0.7 T, such that the single-qubit Rabi QRabi = fRabiTRabi was maximized. Simultaneously, the chosen implementation of entangling gate relied on the exchange interaction being smaller than the Zeeman energy difference of the two qubits (Jexc ≪ ΔEZ). We chose our B0 values to meet this requirement.

Noise spectrum at a high and a low-sensitivity point of a Coulomb oscillation at B0 = 0.662 − 0.7 T for devices A–D. Voltage noise spectrum is first calculated using a Fast Fourier transform on extracted SET current measurements divided by the slope of the Coulomb peak, and finally converted into a charge noise spectrum in μeV using the lever arm58. Charge noise at 1 Hz ranges between \(0.79(4)-0.98(7)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{e}}{\rm{V}}/\sqrt{{\rm{H}}{\rm{z}}}\). Solid line is a power law fit of the power spectral density with exponent ranging between a = 0.50(7) − 1.19(5).

a,b, Spin relaxation of qubit 1 (a) and 2 (b) spin up to the ground state \(| \downarrow \downarrow \rangle \). Curves are fitted to an exponential decay resulting in a relaxation time of T1,Q1 = 2.4(2) s (a = 0.999, b = 0.847) and T1,Q2 = 6.3(6) s (a = 0.989, b = 1.183), respectively. For long wait times, the pure \(| \downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) state decays to its thermal equilibrium following the Fermi-Dirac distribution at finite temperatures. c,d, Ramsey experiment for qubit 1 (c) and 2 (d) fitted to a sinusoidal exponential decay resulting in a coherence time of \({T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}1}^{* }=30.2(6)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\) (a = −0.498, fdet = 95 kHz, b = 1.874, c = 0.498) and \({T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}2}^{* }=29.1(6)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\) (a = −0.488, fdet = 102 kHz, b = 1.884, c = 0.499), respectively. The oscillation is induced by a phase shift corresponding to a 100 kHz detuning. Every data point is averaged for 1,000 repeats, each integrating the readout signal for tint = 100 μs. We use real-time Larmor frequency feedback between repeats using the protocol described in ref. 39. e,f, Hahn echo experiment for qubit 1 (e) and 2 (f) fitted to an exponential decay resulting in a coherence time of \({T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}1}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}=445(6)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\) (a = 0.931, b = 1.263, c = 0.035) and \({T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}=803(6)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\) (a = 0.908, b = 3.125, c = 0.040), respectively. We measure all six single qubit projections and fit the state purity γstate. Error bars represent the 95% confidence level.

a–d, Single qubit Larmor frequency deviation of qubit 1 and 2 across devices A – D (a–d) as a function of lab time during a GST experiment nominally equivalent to the ones discussed in the main text (Fig. 4). Figures are plotted with the same y-axis range. The standard deviation of the frequency feedback of qubit 2 (73–99 kHz) is larger compared to qubit 1 (27–52 kHz) across all devices. The microwave local oscillator frequency is set to fLO = 18.610−19.590 GHz (compare Table 1). Frequency feedback is implemented by following the protocol described in ref. 39.

GST-estimated SPAM operations, with the initial state represented as a density matrix and the terminating parity measurement as a POVM, yield a \(| \downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) state initialization fidelity of Finit = 99.996(49)% and an even/odd parity measurement of Fmeas = 99.959(59)%, respectively. The combined state preparation and measurement fidelity is calculated to FSPAM = 99.95(8)%. Error bars represent the 95% confidence level.

Each plot shows I–V data for 16 quantum-dot devices (coloured curves) measured with a cryo-prober at around 1 K. One device with same design parameters as devices A–D, and 15 with different design parameters, all from the same 300 mm wafer. Different panels pertain to the gate electrodes (EB1, P1, J, P2, EB2, RG, CBs) or to all gates (top left).

Gate infidelities \(1-{\mathcal{F}}\) benchmarked using GST as a function of Larmor frequency feedback rate (the frequency at which the feedback is executed and the Larmor frequency updated) at B0 = 0.666 T. We estimate the precision to be ~5 kHz, based on the deviation from the induced 100 kHz oscillations in Ramsey experiments shown in Extended Data Fig. 2. The virtual ZI and IZ gates are independent of the Larmor frequency and omitted. Each GST experiment consists of 12,263 sequences repeated 100 times. The Larmor frequency feedback circuit is executed with increasing rate, i.e. after every 3000th, 1000th, 300th, 100th, 30th, 10th, 3rd, and single GST gate sequence. All gate infidelities decrease with increasing Larmor frequency feedback rate. The dominant infidelity contribution to the XI, II, and CZ gate is the stochastic IZ error generator, originating from idling of qubit 2. The IX gate infidelity is dominated by the respective ZI error generator, originating from idling of qubit 1. Hamiltonian ZI and IZ error generators, not plotted here, contribute about 0.4% to the infidelity of the CZ gate. Better calibration, as done in the main text (Fig. 4), removes the Hamiltonian errors almost entirely and brings the all gate infidelities below the commonly targeted 1% infidelity threshold represented by the black dashed line. Error bars represent the 95% confidence level.

Infidelity contribution of Hamiltonian and stochastic error generators of the full gate set XI (a), IX (b), ZI (c), IZ (d), II (e), and CZ (f) comparing the effect of removing gate sequences with Larmor frequency jumps > 50 kHz in post-selection at B0 = 0.666 T using GST. Hamiltonian errors contribute to the infidelity in second order, while stochastic errors contribute in first order. The ZI and IZ gates are implemented virtually and are independent of that post selection within error bars. The original (without post-selection) GST experiment consisted of 12,263 sequences, with Larmor frequency feedback after every 10th sequence, repeated 400 times. 171 repeats passed the post-selection for analysis. Error bars represent the 95% confidence level.

a,b, Larmor frequency feedback σ(ΔfL) during interleaved Ramsey and Hahn echo measurements for different magnetic field amplitudes B0 of qubit 1 and 2, respectively. Each Ramsey experiment is repeated at least 10,000 times, with Larmor frequency feedback before each repeat, corresponding to 10,000 data points and roughly 25 min. For magnetic field amplitudes of B0 = 0.05 T, 0.1 T, 0.8 T, and 1.1 T, 50,000, 100,000, 50,000, and 40,000 Ramsey repeats are measured and then truncated in post batched in chunks of 10,000 repeats displayed here shaded. Each Hahn experiment is repeated 2,000 times for all six state projections [+X,−X,+Y,−Y,+Z,−Z], with Larmor feedback between each repeat for each projection, corresponding to 12,000 data points and roughly 30 min. The Hahn echo experiment for B0 = 1.3 T is only repeated 500 times.

a,b, Standard deviation of the Larmor frequency variation σ(ΔfL) obtained from real-time Larmor frequency feedback during interleaved Ramsey and Hahn echo measurements as a function of magnetic field amplitudes B0 of qubit 1 and 2, respectively. The second y-axis on the right shows the Stark shift ΔΩStark of three gates P1, J, and P2 in the active region forming the double-dot system. Dashed lines follow a linear fit ΔΩStark ⋅ B0, resulting in ΔΩStark(P1, J, P2) = (−19.9(4), 31.3(3), 14.2(4)) MHz/(V·T) and = (0, 3.2(2), 16.7(4)) MHz/(V·T) for qubit 1 and 2, respectively. Error bars for the standard deviation of the Larmor frequency variation are only extracted for magnetic field amplitudes of B0 = 0.05 T, 0.1 T, 0.8 T, and 1.1 T with 50,000, 100,000, 50,000, and 40,000 Ramsey repeats batched in chunks of 10,000, respectively. Error bars represent the 95% confidence level.

a,b, Standard deviation of the Larmor frequency variation σ(ΔfL) obtained from real-time Larmor frequency feedback during interleaved Ramsey measurements as a function of total run time for a range of magnetic field amplitudes B0 of qubit 1 and 2, respectively. The second y-axis on the right shows the inverse 1/σ(ΔfL) as an approximation for expected \({T}_{2}^{* }\).

a,b, Cumulative \({T}_{2}^{* }\) of qubit 1 and 2 as a function of increasing number of experiment repeats and total measurement time for a range of magnetic field amplitudes B0, respectively. Each experiment is defined by 101 shots of the Ramsey circuit with varying wait time. c,d, \({T}_{2}^{* }\) of qubit 1 and 2 as a function of lab time, respectively. Each data point is obtained by 100 repeated Ramsey experiments taking a total of approximately 15 s. We use real-time Larmor frequency feedback between Ramsey experiment repeats. Shaded error regions represent the 95% confidence level.

Protein design has focused on the design of ground states, ensuring that they are sufficiently low energy to be highly populated1. Designing the kinetics and dynamics of a system requires, in addition, the design of excited states that are traversed in transitions from one low-lying state to another2,3. This is a challenging task because such states must be sufficiently strained to be poorly populated, but not so strained that they are not populated at all, and because protein design methods have focused on generating near-ideal structures4,5,6,7. Here we describe a general approach for designing systems that use an induced-fit power stroke8 to generate a structurally frustrated9 and strained excited state, allosterically driving protein complex dissociation. X-ray crystallography, double electron–electron resonance spectroscopy and kinetic binding measurements show that incorporating excited states enables the design of effector-induced increases in dissociation rates as high as 5,700-fold. We highlight the power of this approach by designing rapid biosensors, kinetically controlled circuits and cytokine mimics that can be dissociated from their receptors within seconds, enabling dissection of the temporal dynamics of interleukin-2 signalling.

Protein–protein interactions orchestrate much of biological function. High-affinity interactions enable protein circuits to respond to low concentrations of stimuli and to act potently on targets; fast exchange enables them to respond quickly to changes in stimuli. These two properties cannot usually be achieved simultaneously in binary interactions because they depend on the interaction off-rate in opposite ways: high affinity usually requires slow dissociation (low off-rate), whereas rapid exchange requires fast dissociation (high off-rate) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Several natural systems exhibit ‘facilitated dissociation'10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20, in which an effector (E) can bind to a target–host (TH) complex to form an excited ternary complex (THE)20,21,22,23,24,25,26 from which the target dissociates quickly (Fig. 1a–c). In such a system, the target can bind tightly to the host, yet can also be rapidly released by adding the effector27. In engineered DNA systems, the kinetic control afforded by an analogous phenomenon (toehold-mediated strand displacement) has enabled the construction of many complex functions28,29, but DNA systems have limited utility for directly interfacing with biology. Protein binding and unbinding can be readily coupled to biological processes, but there has been no general approach to design kinetic control over protein interactions.

a–c, A high-affinity interaction can rapidly exchange through facilitated dissociation (bottom pathways), but not through mutually exclusive competition (top pathways). a, Reaction diagram. b, Energy diagram. c, Schematic of induced-fit facilitated dissociation (bottom) compared with slow mutually exclusive competition (top). The host protein (H, subscripted by conformational state X or Y) is shown in blue, the target (T) in pink and the effector (E) in orange. d, Structural models of starting components (effector-responsive switch and arbitrary binder–target pair) combined to construct facilitated dissociation systems. e, Structural models of example proteins designed to undergo a facilitated dissociation process starting from a tightly interacting state X (left) through a structurally frustrated ternary intermediate in state Y (right, solid). State X (transparent) is included to show the conformational change. Thinner arrows indicate structural features and thicker arrows indicate state changes.

We set out to design protein systems that undergo facilitated dissociation. Given an interacting protein binder–target pair, we reasoned that we could construct host proteins with controllable dissociation kinetics by fusing an effector-responsive conformational switch to the binder such that when the effector is not bound, the target can bind normally, but in the alternate effector-bound conformation, the switch clashes with the target, leading to strain in the target–host–effector ternary complex that resolves when the target dissociates30 (Fig. 1d,e; nomenclature detailed in Supplementary Note 1). This would allosterically couple the effector and target, and facilitated dissociation could proceed through the strained ternary complex intermediate faster than spontaneous dissociation of the target in mutually exclusive competition (Fig. 1c). Crucially, the energy of this ternary intermediate must be neither too high (otherwise the facilitated dissociation pathway would not be faster) nor too low (otherwise the target would not dissociate) (Fig. 1b). To set the ternary intermediate energy within this optimal range (Supplementary Fig. 2), we reasoned that we could control the level of strain in the ternary complex by varying the geometry of the switch–binder fusion. To access this strained state effectively, we reasoned that binding the effector should rapidly drive the conformational change against the resisting force associated with generating strain. Such a ‘driven' motion would be akin to the power strokes of motor proteins: a large conformational change that is both thermodynamically and kinetically favoured (a low-barrier descent down a steep energy gradient)8,31. Compared with the mechanism of direct steric overlap between target and effector, as in many existing facilitated dissociation systems17,18,19,20,26,32, this allosteric mechanism should be quite modular: such a force-generating switch could be fused to almost any binder to enable facilitated dissociation of its target.

We began by using a previously designed effector-responsive conformational switch (hinge protein cs221; ref. 33) to test the concept of allosteric coupling by switching steric clashes between the host and the target. This switch can undergo a rigid-body hinge motion to transition from a closed state (X) to an open state (Y), and in the open state Y can bind an effector peptide quite tightly (koff = 5 × 10−6 s−1). As a model binder–target interaction, we chose a designed heterodimer pair (LHD101 (ref. 34) modified as described in Supplementary Fig. 3) with dissociation slow enough (koff = 9 × 10−5 s−1) to allow us to easily measure substantial effector-induced acceleration of target dissociation, but not slower than the effector dissociation so that the target would be more likely than the effector to dissociate from the ternary complex. To allosterically couple binding of the effector to dissociation of the target, we designed structured fusions of the hinge switch and binder such that when the switch is in state X, the target can bind, but when in the effector-bound state Y, it will clash strongly (Fig. 1d,e, Supplementary Fig. 4a,b and Methods). We obtained synthetic genes encoding 12 designs, expressed and purified the proteins from Escherichia coli and found that the best (allosteric switch 0; AS0) showed slow and reduced effector association in the presence of the target (Supplementary Fig. 5d), indicating the desired allosteric coupling but also the need for designs with a faster, driven pathway for effector binding against the target.

In these first designs, because the effector-binding cleft is closed in state X, the hinge switch must first transition to the open state Y before the effector can bind (a conformational selection mechanism). Because state Y clashes with the target, this conformational change is slow when the target is bound, limiting the rate of effector association and the overall rate of facilitated dissociation (Supplementary Fig. 4c). This slow step could be bypassed if the effector could instead first bind to state X and accelerate the transition to state Y. An induced-fit mechanism could provide the driving force: an intrinsically disordered effector could weakly engage with state X, and fold and make more extensive interactions in the strained ternary complex in state Y35, driving the transition in a power-stroke-like motion36,37.

Such a mechanism would require new switches that, in state X and throughout the conformational transition, retain an open effector-binding cleft where a flexible effector could associate (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 4d). Starting from AS0, we constructed a new state X by shifting the two domains from their state Y positions relative to each other (by one heptad along the helix of domain 1 that contacts domain 2), building a new loop between the domains, and optimizing single sequences that could adopt both this new state X and the original effector-bound state Y (Supplementary Fig. 4e and Methods). This approach maintains the open cleft in state X by introducing minimal rotation from state Y and simplifies the multi-state sequence-design challenge by minimizing the local structural differences between the two states. Transition between conformational states occurs by a register shift throughout which the cleft could remain open and bind the effector (Supplementary Fig. 4f). Because these new hosts retain the state Y backbone validated to clash with the target in AS0, we should observe allosteric coupling if the switch works as designed (Fig. 1e).

We obtained synthetic genes encoding ten such designs, and found that four tightly bound the effector (dissociation constant (Kd) < 1 nM; Supplementary Fig. 6d). To measure facilitated dissociation kinetics, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR): with the target affixed to the SPR surface, we incubated with the host, then measured target–host dissociation under flow of various concentrations of effector. For these four designs, the target dissociates slowly in the absence of the effector; adding the effector increases the rate of dissociation markedly (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 7), but minimally affects the target off-rate from a control static binder fusion that lacks an effector-binding site (Supplementary Fig. 7).

To investigate the mechanism of facilitated dissociation (Fig. 2b), we focused on AS1, the design with the tightest effector binding (Kd,H:E ≈ 10 pM). We directly measured the rate constant of target dissociation from the strained ternary complex (koff,T:HE) by flowing pre-incubated host–effector complex at a high concentration to form the strained ternary complex with the target on the SPR surface, then tracking target–host dissociation under continued flow of the effector (Fig. 2e, Supplementary Fig. 7 and Methods). In the full facilitated dissociation process, as the concentration of added effector increases, the rate constant of facilitated target dissociation approaches koff,T:HE (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 7), strongly suggesting that the ternary complex is an intermediate in the facilitated dissociation process (Fig. 2b, lower pathways).

To further analyse the mechanism of forming the strained ternary complex, we characterized facilitated dissociation with two different effectors: the peptide and a three-helix bundle ‘3hb' (3hb21; ref. 33) (Fig. 2c). The two effectors make nearly identical interactions with AS1, but when unbound, the peptide is disordered whereas the 3hb is structured (Fig. 2d). With AS1 affixed to the SPR surface, we measured the rate of effector association to form the strained ternary complex by first saturating AS1 with target, then flowing varying concentrations of effector mixed with constant excess target (to ensure that the target remains bound after effector association). The apparent on-rate for binding to the target–AS1 complex increases linearly with concentration for the peptide (Fig. 2e) but hyperbolically for the 3hb, saturating at the rate of a concentration-independent step (Fig. 2f). Notably, with the 3hb, the rate of facilitated target dissociation saturates at this same value (Fig. 2h). The simplest explanation of these results is that the rigid 3hb can only bind to the fully open state Y of AS1 and that the THX → THY conformational change is slow (owing to partial blocking by the bound target), so it becomes rate limiting for both the association with the target–AS1 complex and the overall facilitated dissociation process (Fig. 2b, middle pathway). In contrast to the 3hb, peptide effector binding (Fig. 2e) and resulting target destabilization (Fig. 2g) can both occur more rapidly than the THX → THY conformational change, suggesting that the more flexible peptide effector can bind to AS1 in state X to accelerate this conformational change through an induced-fit mechanism12,35,38 (Fig. 2b, bottom pathway).

We used X-ray crystallography to structurally characterize multiple states of our designed systems. For both the AS1 and the AS5 systems, the crystal structures of the hosts alone (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 1a) and of the host–effector complexes (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 1b) closely match the design models (maximum 1.3 Å Cα root mean square deviation (RMSD)). The unbound structures show an open hydrophobic cleft in the new designed state X poised to bind the effector, and the effector-bound structures show that binding the effector causes the two switch domains to register-shift into the designed state Y (Supplementary Note 2). Structures of the target–AS1 complex show that the target binds as designed (Fig. 3c, top), with some strain suggested by small variations among the structures (Fig. 3c, bottom, Extended Data Fig. 1c,d and Supplementary Note 3).

The target–AS1 complex (pink and blue) hydrogen bonds (green) are less strained than the ternary complex (grey) hydrogen bonds (red).

We next sought to determine how the target–host–effector ternary complex deforms to resolve the designed clash. At the concentrations of the components used in the above experiments, the AS1 ternary complex is an only transiently populated excited state, but at high concentrations it becomes the dominant state (Kd,T:HE = 200 nM; Supplementary Fig. 9). This enabled us to solve structures of AS1 in the ternary complex intermediate with both target and effector. In structures from two different crystals, the switch region closely matches the state Y design model, and the rest of the structure strains to resolve the structural frustration from simultaneously binding the target and occupying state Y (Fig. 3d). This strain distributes across multiple locations in the structure: the binder fusion bends, the portion of the target that directly clashes with the switch becomes disordered and the target twists at its interface, disrupting the interfacial hydrophobic packing (Fig. 3e, top) and shearing the interfacial strand pairing (Fig. 3e, bottom). Double electron–electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy (Extended Data Fig. 2) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (Extended Data Fig. 3) suggest that the ternary complex is dynamic, with varying amounts of strain at each location (Supplementary Note 3).

We next investigated the factors that contribute to the dissociation kinetics, seeking to maximize the dissociation rate enhancement by (1) reducing the base rate of target dissociation and (2) increasing the rate of facilitated dissociation. For (1), the target dissociates 20-fold faster from AS1 than from an unhindered binder fusion (Supplementary Fig. 7), probably because of minor strain in the target–AS1 complex (Extended Data Fig. 1c). For (2), with AS1, effector association can occur at least five times faster than target dissociation from the ternary complex (Fig. 2e); thus, moderately increasing the energy of the ternary complex could accelerate the target dissociation step without making the effector association rate limiting, thereby increasing the overall rate of facilitated dissociation. Assuming a simple spring model of the ternary complex, this could be achieved by deforming with a greater magnitude or in a direction of higher stiffness (Supplementary Fig. 10a).

We sought to maximize strain energy in the ternary complex by modulating the magnitude and direction of the deformation required to resolve the designed clash (Fig. 4a). Avoiding any clash in state X while maintaining a strong clash in state Y, we sampled a variety of target + binder positions relative to the switch from AS1; rebuilt fusions between the switch and the newly located binder; and selected variants that were predicted by AlphaFold2 (AF2) to have substantial deformations spanning a variety of directions (AF2 predictions of the strained AS1 ternary complex were within 1.0 Å Cα RMSD of the target–AS1–effector crystal structure). These changes to the fusion region, although distant from both binding sites, caused considerable variation in the kinetics of target dissociation and their modulation by the effector (Supplementary Fig. 11). Most of these variants showed reduced target off-rates (compared with AS1) in the absence of effector that increased in the presence of effector (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Table 1), and for the fastest variant (AS117), adding effector accelerated target dissociation by 2,400-fold, reaching a rate exceeding that of the original AS1 (Fig. 4b). By comparing the predicted deformations with the facilitated dissociation rates in the forward and reverse directions (Supplementary Note 4), we found that the global strain energy of the ternary complex depends on both the magnitude and the direction of the deformation (Supplementary Fig. 10) and that strain can distribute non-uniformly throughout the structure, leading to kinetic asymmetry24 (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Extended Data Fig. 4).

We next set out to use facilitated dissociation to construct protein systems with kinetic behaviours that were previously inaccessible to design. First, inspired by toehold-mediated strand displacement in DNA28, we sought to create a kinetically trapped system which, on stimulation, quickly reconfigures through a chain reaction. To investigate this, we fused the effector peptide (E2) for a second reporter hinge (H2) to the target such that E2 is occluded when this fusion (E2–target) is bound to a host (Extended Data Fig. 5). As intended, the release of E2–target from AS114 and the subsequent switching of H2 is slow, but accelerates markedly upon addition of the original effector, which accelerates E2–target dissociation (we include excess original target to prevent E2–target rebinding39; Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 5). In principle, multiple orthogonal hosts could be constructed and chained together through such target–effector fusions.

Second, we reasoned that our designs could complement split protein systems with high affinity and enable them to be switched off rapidly. To test this, we tagged AS1 and the target with NanoBiT split luciferase fragments, LgBiT and SmBiT (ref. 40). When combined, these components exhibit high luciferase activity that disappears much more rapidly upon addition of effector and excess untagged target than upon addition of excess untagged target alone (Fig. 4d).

Third, in previously designed thermodynamically controlled biosensors that operate through a conformational selection mechanism, there is a trade-off between dynamic range and response time (reducing background by lowering the energy of the ‘off' state generally slows interconversion with the ‘on' state)41,42. We reasoned that sensors based on facilitated dissociation could be limited by the rate of target association rather than by internal conformational switching, and found that by caging the SmBiT peptide within the effector bound to a host, facilitated dissociation (in the reverse direction compared with previously) upon binding the target uncaged the SmBiT rapidly to enable luciferase reconstitution (Methods). Using this strategy together with a designed SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) binder (LCB1; ref. 43), we generated 16 ‘AScov' sensor designs in which the RBD clashes with the switch in state Y but not in state X. After addition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, the best sensor shows a 30-fold increase in luciferase activity, with a half-time of 30 s (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 6)—70 times faster than a previously designed LOCKR-based SARS-CoV-2 sensor that relies on conformational selection41. Thus, using this platform, a binder to almost any target can be turned into a single-component sensor that is sufficiently fast that, in most practical applications, its response time will be limited by target association rather than by a slow conformational change.

Finally, we investigated whether facilitated dissociation could be used to control cellular processes with high temporal resolution. In cellular signalling, the residence times of ligands on their cognate receptors is thought to modulate the signalling and cellular responses44,45,46. The central immune cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) activates the IL-2 receptor (IL-2Rβγc) by inducing heterodimerization of chains β and γc (ref. 47). The resulting complexes dissociate or degrade on timescales of hours48,49, so controlling the temporal dynamics of IL-2 signalling is difficult: there is no off-switch (Fig. 5a).

We set out to construct a switchable IL-2 mimic that enables control over the lifetime of the IL-2Rβγc complex with a time resolution of seconds (Fig. 5b). Neo2, a previously designed IL-2 mimic, tightly binds to IL-2Rβγc to elicit downstream signalling50. Sampling a variety of γc positions relative to the switch from AS1, we rigidly fused Neo2 to the switch such that in state X, γc can bind, but in the effector-bound state Y, it would strongly clash (Fig. 5c). We identified several designs for which binding the effector markedly accelerates the dissociation of γc from the active signalling complex (Supplementary Fig. 13). For one of these, ASNeo2, binding the effector induces a 1,500-fold increase in the γc off-rate (Fig. 5d). We designed variants of ASNeo2 with different dissociation kinetics and topological safeguards against degradation (Supplementary Note 5); for one, the effector accelerated γc dissociation by 5,700-fold, the highest fold change of all our designed systems (Extended Data Fig. 8).

To investigate the switching capability of ASNeo2 in a physiological context, we quantified the dimerization of labelled IL-2Rβ and γc in the plasma membrane of live cells by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. Dual-colour co-tracking and mobility analyses confirmed that ASNeo2 efficiently dimerizes IL-2Rβ and γc and that adding the effector reverses this association rapidly and completely, even at a high excess of γc (Fig. 5e,f, Extended Data Fig. 7c–i and Supplementary Video 1). By double labelling ASNeo2 on opposite sides, we could observe the effector-induced intramolecular conformational change at the plasma membrane using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) (Extended Data Fig. 7j,k). ASNeo2 activates signalling in human natural killer (NK) cells (YT-1 cell line), and its activity is greatly reduced in the presence of the effector (Fig. 5g). After the effector is added, STAT5 phosphorylation immediately stops accumulating and gradually decreases to a low level (Fig. 5h). The effector blocks ASNeo2 activity nearly as effectively as does ruxolitinib, a JAK1 inhibitor.

To examine how the duration of IL-2 signalling affects the downstream cellular response, we stimulated primary human T cells with ASNeo2 and induced dissociation at various time points. Whereas sustained stimulation was required for proliferation51 (Fig. 5i), protection from apoptosis was evident after a short transient stimulation: cells treated with ASNeo2 and then with effector 5 min afterwards survived three days later at double the rate of an unstimulated control (Fig. 5j), despite the suppression of most downstream IL-2 target proteins (Extended Data Fig. 9e). This likely reflects reduced caspase-3 activity and increased BCL2 expression after transient stimulation (Fig. 5k and Extended Data Fig. 9g).

To further investigate the dependence of IL-2 signalling on the lifetime of the signalling complexes, we compared RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from T cells that were treated with ASNeo2 transiently, continuously or not at all (Fig. 5l–n and Supplementary Fig. 14). Transient stimulation (through incubation with ASNeo2 followed by effector-induced dissociation) upregulated genes that are involved in suppressing apoptosis (BCL2, NIBAN2 and RNF157), cell-cycle regulation (CDKN2B, CDK6, CCND2 and PIM1), suppressing cytokine signalling (SOCS2 and CISH) and immune activation (TNFSF8, HAVCR2 and PTGER2) (Fig. 5m). On activation, T cells typically shift their energy production from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis52, and we observed that transient stimulation downregulates oxidative-phosphorylation genes (Fig. 5n and Supplementary Fig. 15; glycolysis genes are not yet upregulated). Sustained stimulation activated genes associated with mTORC-driven metabolic changes and MYC- and E2F-driven cell-cycle progression (for example, CDK4 and POLD2), but transient stimulation did not (Fig. 5n, Extended Data Fig. 9i and Supplementary Fig. 15), suggesting that IL-2 signalling must be sustained to pass the G1/S checkpoint. Transient stimulation did activate genes associated with formation of the mitotic spindle (for example, DOCK2 and KIF1B) (Fig. 5n, Extended Data Fig. 9i and Supplementary Fig. 15), suggesting that preparations for mitosis are made immediately after T cell activation, before cell-cycle checkpoints. These results show how designed facilitated dissociation can be used to tackle unanswered questions in cell biology.

We show here that by explicitly considering excited intermediate states when designing coupled protein systems, a broad range of facilitated dissociation systems can be designed. We use a switchable target binder (host) and a flexible effector that can rapidly bind to and switch the target–host complex to induce a large steric clash with the target, forming a strained excited ternary complex. By modulating the strain energy of the ternary complex, we can tune the resulting acceleration of target dissociation. Crystal structures throughout the facilitated dissociation process confirm our ability to design excited states and large register-shift conformational changes. Our designed dynamic systems show both a high dynamic range and a rapid stimulus response, demonstrating the kinetic advantage of facilitated dissociation over mutually exclusive competition.

Power-stroke mechanisms8,31 can generate force more efficiently than can ratchet mechanisms (in which a single large step is rectified at the end of the conformational change)37. Induced folding underlies the kinesin power stroke53, and our flexible effector likely also folds upon binding, accelerating the conformational transition by lowering the energy barrier: the energetic costs of uphill steps along the transition coordinate can be compensated by the formation of additional interactions with the folding peptide35,36,54. In contrast to this induced-fit mechanism of the flexible effector, we find that a rigid effector provides reduced rate acceleration even though it binds more tightly38. In kinesin and other biological systems, it is difficult to directly assess the role of flexibility and folding upon binding in overall function; by contrast, our designed model systems allow the direct comparison of flexible and rigid effectors and show that the former yield faster conformational transitions against loads.

Most known examples of facilitated dissociation couple the target and the effector through a combination of direct steric overlap17,18,19,20,26,32 and intricate allostery14,15,22,23,24,25. By contrast, because our allosteric mechanism of switching steric clashes places no specific requirements on the binder or target, our approach can be used to dynamically regulate protein–protein interactions quite generally: by fusing to our switch, almost any binding interaction can be made to switch off rapidly in the presence of an effector. Our approach transferred immediately to rapidly switching active IL-2-like signalling complexes: we obtained several working designs on the first attempt (in which 24 designs were tested). Controlling the duration of IL-2 signalling with such switchable cytokines could enable investigation of early events in signalling or tuning of the cell response through timing-sensitive regulatory mechanisms further downstream51 (for example, disrupting signalling complexes at the cell surface or later in the endosome49 could be used to distinguish the cellular responses induced by signalling from each compartment55). Therapeutically, systemic administration of the effector and local administration of the switchable cytokine could elicit strong immune activation at only the site of administration (because any cytokine that escapes into circulation would be deactivated by the effector). More generally, our work provides a route to designing the rates and pathways of protein motion and change, which should ultimately enable the construction of complex, lifelike protein machinery.

In PyMOL, we manually positioned the switch relative to the binder–target complex subject to several constraints: there is no steric overlap between the target and switch state X; there is large steric overlap between the target and switch state Y; the smallest deformation that could be undergone by the switch and the target to resolve this clash is in the desired direction; and the switch C terminus and binder N terminus are relatively oriented such that sensible additional structure could be built between the switch and the binder to rigidly fuse them as positioned. To aid in visualizing this additional structure, we also included placeholder helices while manually positioning the switch and binder, effectively ‘sketching' the fusion (Supplementary Fig. 4b).

We then refined these sketches into plausible backbones. For the initial fusions including AS0, we extracted the centre four residues of the placeholder helix, then used inpainting with RosettaFold56 to scaffold that fragment between the switch and the binder. For later fusions, including the AS1 variants and ASNeo2 designs, we first used Rosetta FastDesign57 to sample around the starting sketch for designable positions of the switch, binder and placeholder helices while keeping the region of the state X switch that clashes in state Y fixed relative to the target, then used RFDiffusion7 (conditioned on the secondary structure and block adjacency of the sketches) to build structure between the sampled switch and binder positions. During both structure-generation approaches, we masked noncritical residues on the switch and binder interfacing with the fusion structure. After generation of the fusion backbone structure, we used ProteinMPNN58 to optimize sequences for the fusion structure and the masked residues on the switch and binder. To filter designs, we used AF259 (with initial guess (AF2-IG)60 for complex predictions) to predict the structure of the fusions alone, with the target, and with the effector, selecting designs for which each structural state is correctly and confidently predicted by a majority of the five model weight sets. Finally, for the AS1 variants and ASNeo2 designs, we used AF2-IG to predict the structure of the strained ternary complexes, selecting sets with a diversity of deformation directions.

Designs AS1, AS2, AS5 and AS7 were generated starting from design AS0, which contains the hinge switch cs221. When cs221 was designed, its state Y was generated by copying the N-terminal domain (helices 1–4) of its parent scaffold (DHR20; ref. 61), aligning helix 4 of the copy to the corresponding helix of DHR20 offset by three residues, and combining the transformed N-terminal domain and original C-terminal domain into a single protein33. Thus, relative to the C-terminal domain, the N-terminal domain is both rotated around and translated along the axis of helix 4, exposing a cleft between the domains for binding a helical peptide. Now, to generate a new state X for this switch that retains an open cleft, we repeated this procedure but aligned the N-terminal domain with a residue offset of −4 instead of 3, so that overall this position of the N-terminal domain is shifted from state Y along helix 4 by one heptad (Supplementary Fig. 4e). This introduces minimal rotation and thus maintains the open cleft. We combined this new position of the N-terminal domain with the entire C-terminal domain of AS0 (including the fusion to LHD101B), then used Rosetta FastDesign to further sample designable positions of the N-terminal domain around this starting point. In half of the design trajectories, we included a placeholder helix in the cleft to help ensure it remains open. We then used inpainting with RosettaFold to generate loops connecting the domains, then paired these complete state X backbones with the original effector-bound state Y of AS0 (also generating new loops between domains in state Y as necessary to match the loop lengths of each new state X).

To generate single sequences that support both states, we first performed multi-state design with Rosetta FastDesign (enforcing sequence symmetry between states) to further refine the paired backbones so that they are more mutually compatible, then used ProteinMPNN with residue probabilities tied at corresponding positions between states to optimize sequences simultaneously for both conformations33. During these sequence-design steps, the sequence of the effector and of the binder fusion was kept fixed. To filter designs, we used AF2-IG to predict the structure of the switches both with and without the effector, selecting designs for which the new state X (in the absence of effector) and state Y (in the presence of effector) are correctly and confidently predicted by a majority of the five model weight sets. To further ensure that these designs favour state X in the absence of effector and state Y in the presence of effector, we only selected designs that scored more favourably in Rosetta in state X than in state Y, but also scored more favourably in state Y with the effector bound than the sum of the scores of state X and the unbound effector.

We first sought to cage the SmBiT peptide within the effector so that, through reverse facilitated dissociation, binding of the target would rapidly uncage the SmBiT to enable luciferase reconstitution. We grafted SmBiT onto the effector peptide at a range of positions, then screened these ‘SmBiTgraft' variants for binding to AS0 and rapid dissociation after binding of the target. We used AS0 as the base design, reasoning that its closed state X would slow undesired peptide reassociation. For each working SmBiTgraft, we then generated a flexibly linked LgBiT–SmBiTgraft–AS0 construct. The best construct shows low luciferase activity that increases rapidly after addition of target, but only slowly after addition of effector peptide (which must compete directly with SmBiTgraft) (Extended Data Fig. 6). To demonstrate the modularity of this platform, using the methods described above for designing hosts, we rigidly fused a SARS-CoV-2 RBD binder (LCB1; ref. 43) to the switch in place of the target binder such that the RBD clashes with the switch in state Y but not in state X, and tested 16 of these AScov fusion designs.

Synthetic DNA fragments encoding each design were obtained from IDT as eBlocks and cloned into custom vectors using Golden Gate assembly62. Designs usually contained a C-terminal sequence-specific nickel-assisted cleavage (SNAC) tag63 and a 6×His tag (MSG-Protein-GSGSHHWGSTHHHHHH). Proteins to be captured on the chip for SPR experiments contained an N-terminal AviTag and a C-terminal 6×His tag (MSGLNDIFEAQKIEWHESSG-Protein-GSGHHHHHH). For the size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) binding experiments shown in Supplementary Fig. 6 and for screening SmBiTgraft effector peptide variants with SPR, the effector was fused to superfolder GFP in a sfGFP-GSSG-Effector-GSHHHHHH construct. To rapidly break split luciferases, AS1 was fused to LgBiT in a MSG-AS1-linker-LgBiT-GSHHHHHH construct and the target was fused to SmBiT in a MSG-Target-linker-SmBiT-GSHHHHHH construct. In the rapid sensors, AS0 and AScov were fused to LgBiT and a SmBiT-containing effector in a MSGHHHHHHGS-LgBiT-linker-SmBiTgraft-linker-(AS0 or AScov)-GS construct. Sequences for all designs are available in Supplementary Table 4.

All proteins were expressed from NEB BL21(DE3) E. coli cells using TBII (MpBio) autoinduction medium with 0.5% (w/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) glucose, 0.2% (w/v) lactose, 20 mM MgSO4, trace metal mix and 50 μg ml−1 kanamycin. Expression cultures (50 ml) were grown either at 37 °C for 16–20 h or at 37 °C for 6–8 h, then at 18 °C for 16–20 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 5 ml lysis buffer (100 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 Pierce Protease Inhibitor Mini Tablets, EDTA-free per 50 ml) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000g for 30 min. Protein in the soluble lysate was bound to 1 ml Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN), washed with 5 ml low-salt wash buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 50 mM imidazole), 5 ml high-salt wash buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl, 50 mM imidazole) and 5 ml low-salt wash buffer, and eluted in 1.2 ml elution buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 500 mM imidazole) after a 0.4 ml pre-elution. The proteins were further purified by SEC on a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system with a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl) with 1-ml fractions. Where possible, fractions that probably corresponded to protein monomers were selected. Final protein concentrations were estimated using molar extinction coefficients predicted from the protein sequence and integrating the absorbance at 280 nm over the selected fractions. Correct protein molecular weights were confirmed using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS).

The effector peptide cs221B was chemically synthesized by GenScript. The TAMRA-labelled effector used in fluorescence polarization (FP) experiments was synthesized as previously described33.

Individual host proteins, sfGFP–effector and 1:1 host:sfGFP–effector mixtures were prepared at 20 μM in TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl). A 0.5-ml quantity of each solution was injected onto a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column in TBS and the absorbance at 230 nm was monitored for changes in the retention volumes of the mixture compared with the individual proteins.

FP binding experiments with TAMRA-labelled effector were performed at 25 °C in TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl) with 0.05% v/v TWEEN20 in 96-well plates (Corning 3686). Parallel and perpendicular fluorescence intensity was measured using a Synergy Neo2 plate reader with an FP 530/590 filter cube. Fluorescence polarization P (in units of mP) was calculated by the following expression:

For affinity measurements, host proteins were titrated by twofold serial dilution across TAMRA–effector (at a constant concentration between 0.1 and 1 nM) through 24 wells, with a final volume of 80 μl in each well. Plates were incubated for at least 12 h at room temperature to fully equilibrate before measurement. To determine affinities, the following binding isotherm function was fitted to the measured polarization values using nonlinear least-squares minimization:

where P is the modelled polarization, P0 is the polarization of free effector, P1 is the change in polarization after binding the host, fbound is the fraction of effector bound to the host, [H] and [E] are the total concentrations of host and effector, respectively, and Kd is the affinity between the host and the effector. When the fit Kd is lower than [E], affinities are too strong to be accurately measured with this method, so ‘Kd < [E]' is reported.

For kinetic competition measurements, the target LHD101An1 was titrated by twofold serial dilution across the host protein (at a constant concentration of 22 nM) through five wells (a sixth well with just the host was also included) with a final volume of 72 μl in each well. Plates were incubated for one hour to allow the host and the target to equilibrate. To each well, 8 μl of 200 nM TAMRA–effector was added and rapidly mixed using a multichannel pipette, and the measurement was started immediately afterwards. This resulted in a 20 nM final concentration of both host and effector in a final volume of 80 μl per well. The following single exponential decay function was fitted to the measured polarization time courses using nonlinear least-squares minimization:

where P is the modelled polarization, P0 is the polarization of free effector, P1 is the amplitude of the change in polarization, kapp is the apparent rate constant and t is the time after the start of the measurement.

To measure facilitated dissociation in the reverse direction, host and TAMRA–effector were incubated at a 2:1 ratio to fully saturate the effector with host, diluted to 4 nM host and 2 nM effector, and distributed across 11 wells (40 μl in each well). In nine separate wells, the target was titrated by a fourfold serial dilution with constant excess unlabelled effector (40 μM). Just excess unlabelled effector at 40 μM was prepared in the 10th separate well (to measure the base rate of effector dissociation), and buffer was prepared in the 11th (to confirm the baseline remains stable). Forty microlitres of these target + effector solutions were added to the 11 host + TAMRA–effector wells and rapidly mixed using a multichannel pipette, and the measurement was started immediately afterwards. This resulted in final concentrations of 2 nM host, 1 nM TAMRA–effector, 20 μM unlabelled effector (to make the dissociation of TAMRA–effector irreversible) and varying concentrations of target in a final volume of 80 μl per well. The following single exponential decay function was fitted to the measured polarization time courses using nonlinear least-squares minimization:

The following hyperbolic function was fitted to the apparent rate constants kapp:

where koff,H:E is the base effector off-rate constant, koff,TH:E is the off-rate constant for accelerated effector dissociation from the ternary complex, K1/2 is the concentration at which half the rate increase from koff,H:E to koff,TH:E is reached and [T] is the concentration of target present.

Proteins to be captured on the SPR chip were expressed with an N-terminal AviTag and purified as described above, except that the proteins were biotinylated after elution from the Ni-NTA resin: to the elutions, 5 μg ml−1 BirA (Avidity), 10 mM ATP, 10 mM Mg(OAc)2 and 100 μM d-biotin were added and allowed to incubate at room temperature for at least 4 h before further purification by SEC. Successful biotinylation was confirmed using LC–MS. SPR measurements were performed at 25 °C in HBS-EP+ buffer (Cytiva) on a Biacore 8K instrument. Biotinylated proteins were immobilized on the chip using the Biotin CAPture system (Cytiva).

For measurements of target off-rate constants, biotinylated target protein was immobilized on the chip. To measure base off-rate constants koff,T:H, host proteins at 50 nM were flowed over the chip for 60 s, then dissociation was measured for 2 h. To measure accelerated off-rate constants koff,T:HE, pre-incubated host–effector complexes (host at 1 μM and effector at 5 μM to ensure that the host is saturated with effector) were flowed for 60 s to form the ternary complex on the chip, then dissociation was measured for 4–20 min under a constant flow of 5 μM effector. Most dissociation data were fitted with the following double exponential decay function to account for populations of host protein with different dissociation kinetics:

where S is the modelled SPR response, S0 is the baseline, S1 and S2 are amplitudes relating to the sizes of each host population, kapp,1 and kapp,2 are apparent rate constants corresponding to each host population, t is the time and t0 is the time at which dissociation initiates. The reported rate constant typically corresponds to the faster and higher amplitude exponential in the fit; instances in which other criteria are used to determine which rate constant corresponds to the change of interest are noted. When clearly only one host population is present (often indicated by kapp,1 ≈ kapp,2 or a large difference between S1 and S2 when fitting a double exponential), the following single exponential decay function was fitted instead, in which the parameters are the same as above (instances in which single exponentials were used are noted):

To measure the rate constant of effector association to form the ternary complex, biotinylated host protein was immobilized on the chip. The host protein was saturated with target by flowing 5 μM target over the chip for 4 min, then a varying concentration of effector and 5 μM target was flowed over the chip for 2–4 min to associate the effector, and finally 5 μM target was flowed over the chip for 4 min to monitor effector dissociation. Target was included at 5 μM (higher than its affinity to the ternary complex) throughout the experiment to ensure that the host remained saturated with target, preventing changes in target binding from convoluting the response from effector binding. Association data were fitted with the following single exponential decay function:

where S is the modelled SPR response, S0 is the baseline, S1 is the amplitude, kapp is the apparent rate constant, t is the time and t0 is the time at which dissociation initiates.

With the peptide effector, the following linear function was fitted to the apparent rate constants:

where kon,TH:E and koff,TH:E are on-rate and off-rate constants and [E] is the concentration of effector flowed over the chip.

With the 3hb effector, the following hyperbolic function was fitted to the apparent rate constants:

where kswitch is the rate constant for the THX → THY conformational change, kunswitch is the rate constant for the THY → THX conformational change, kon,TH:E and koff,TH:E are on-rate and off-rate constants and [E] is the concentration of effector flowed over the chip. This function describes the slow relaxation rate constant of binding by conformational selection64. The data can be fitted with only the slow relaxation because, as the conformational pre-equilibrium favours state X (that is, kswitch « kunswitch), the effect of the fast relaxation on kapp is minimal. During the fit, koff,TH:E was constrained to a low value (<1 × 10−4 s−1), as observed.

To measure the effector-concentration-dependent rate constant of the full facilitated dissociation process, either biotinylated target protein or biotinylated common gamma γc ectodomain (Acro Biosystems ILG-H85E8) was immobilized on the chip. For experiments with ASNeo2 designs, the ASNeo2 hosts were pre-incubated with IL-2Rβ ectodomain (Acro Biosystems CD2-H5221) before association with γc. Each experiment involved multiple cycles of host association and induced dissociation under the flow of various concentrations of effector obtained by twofold serial dilution (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Throughout these cycles, a small population of host that is unresponsive to the effector (‘Hn', owing to partial degradation or misfolding induced by the strain in the ternary complex) could accumulate on the chip (Supplementary Fig. 8a,b). The following system of differential equations describing the expected behaviour of the proteins on the chip (accounting for this accumulation) can be fitted to the dissociation curve of cycle n (Supplementary Fig. 8c):

with initial values computed for each cycle by

and the modelled concentrations of each complex state on the chip is related to the SPR response by

where S is the modelled SPR response, [THE], [TH] and [THn] are concentrations of complex states on the chip, t is the time after the start of the dissociation cycle, [E] is the concentration of effector flowed over the chip, koff,T:H, koff,T:HE, kon,TH:E, koff,TH:E and koff,T:Hn are on-rate and off-rate constants, aTH, aTHE and aTHn are amplitudes relating the concentration of each state on the chip to an SPR response, fn is an amplitude fudge factor for cycle n accounting for small differences in amplitude across cycles and fresponsive is the fraction of host that is responsive to the effector. Varying all of these parameters, this model is then globally fitted to the dissociation curves of all cycles using nonlinear least-squares minimization. Note that with a sufficiently high value of kon,TH:E, this model's dissociation kinetics are determined mainly by the target dissociation parameters koff,T:H and koff,T:HE; meanwhile, the effector binding parameters kon,TH:E and koff,TH:E tend to tightly covary and cannot be accurately determined from these fits. Also note that for designs with low values for koff,T:HE, this model may be less accurate because the assumption that [THE] = 0 at the beginning of each cycle may no longer be valid. To compute the effective rate constant of the full facilitated dissociation process for intact host, we used the following simplified system of differential equations, which no longer accounts for a small population of unresponsive host:

For each effector concentration [E], this system was solved for the half-time of the target:host interaction t1/2 using the rate parameters determined from the original model fitted to the data, and the effective rate constant of the full dissociation process keff was computed from each half-time as follows:

The following hyperbolic function was fitted to the effective rate constants (constrained to the values of koff,T:HE and koff,T:H obtained from the global fit):

where koff,T:H is the base target off-rate constant, koff,T:HE is the off-rate constant for accelerated target dissociation from the ternary complex, K1/2 is the concentration at which half the rate increase from koff,T:H to koff,T:HE is reached and [E] is the concentration of effector flowed over the chip.

The discrepancy in the 3hb EC50 between the 3hb association experiment in Fig. 2f (right) and the target facilitated dissociation experiment in Fig. 2h (right) could result from the fusion tag that was used to fix AS1 to the surface competing with the 3hb for binding the cleft, reducing the apparent 3hb on-rate in the 3hb association experiment but not in the target facilitated dissociation experiment.

All SPR measurements in the main figures were repeated at least once, with similar results.

Circular dichroism spectra were measured at 25 °C on protein samples at 0.2 mg ml−1 in TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl) using a Jasco J-1500 spectrophotometer.

The AS1 TH and THE complexes required increased hydrophobicity to crystallize. This was accomplished by lysine methylation (for crystals AS1_TH 1, AS1_TH 2 and AS1_THE 1) or with the hydrophobic surface mutations K46L, E50W, K172W and E173Y (for crystal AS1_THE 2).

Protein was expressed from NEB BL21(DE3) E. coli cells using TBII autoinduction medium as above but at a larger scale: either 8 × 50 ml or 1–2 × 500 ml cultures. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer and lysed by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000g for 30 min. Protein in the soluble lysate was bound to 8 ml Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN), washed with 10 ml low-salt wash buffer, 30 ml high-salt wash buffer and 10 ml SNAC cleavage buffer (100 mM 2-(N-cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid (CHES), 100 mM acetone oxime, 100 mM NaCl and 500 mM guanidinium chloride, pH 8.6)63 and incubated in 40 ml SNAC cleavage buffer + 2 nM NiCl2 for 12 h at room temperature to cleave. Afterwards, the flowthrough was collected and the beads were washed with 40 ml lysis buffer (minus the protease inhibitors). The amount of cleaved protein in the flowthrough and wash was assessed with SDS–PAGE, and fractions with enough cleaved protein were concentrated and further purified using SEC on an FPLC system with either a Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 GL column or a HiLoad 20/600 Superdex 75 pg column in either TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl) or lysine methylation buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 250 mM NaCl) if lysine residues in the protein were to be methylated. For protein complex cocrystallization, the purified proteins and/or chemically synthesized effector were mixed at equimolar ratios. For some samples (resulting in crystals AS1_TH 1, AS1_TH 2 and AS1_THE 1), lysine residues were methylated as previously described65, and the reaction was quenched using SEC on an FPLC system to buffer-exchange into TBS. Finally, the samples were concentrated to crystallization levels.

Crystallization experiments were done using the sitting drop vapour diffusion method. Initial crystallization trials were set up in 200-nl drops using the 96-well plate format at 20 °C. Crystallization plates were set up using a Mosquito LCP from SPT Labtech, then imaged using UVEX microscopes and UVEX PS-256 from JAN Scientific. Diffraction-quality crystals formed in 0.2 M magnesium chloride hexahydrate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate pH 6.5 and 50% v/v PEG 200 for AS1_H; in 0.2 M sodium chloride, 0.1 M Na/K phosphate pH 6.2 and 50% v/v PEG 200 for CS221B; in 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.0, 5% w/v γ-PGA (Na+ form, LM) and 30% v/v PEG 400 for LHD101An1; in 0.2 M magnesium chloride hexahydrate, 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5 and 25% w/v polyethylene glycol 3,350 for AS5_HE; in 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.0 and 20% (v/v) MPD for AS5_H; in 0.2 M 1,6-hexanediol, 0.2 M 1-butanol, 0.2 M 1,2-propanediol, 0.2 M 2-propanol, 0.2 M 1,4-butanediol, 0.2 M 1,3-propanediol, sodium HEPES, MOPS (acid) pH 7.5, 40% v/v PEG 500 MME and 20% w/v PEG 20000 for AS1_HE; in 0.1 M citric acid pH 3.5 and 2.0 M ammonium sulfate for AS1_THE 1; in 1.0 M lithium chloride, 0.1 M citrate pH 4.0 and 20% w/v PEG 6000 for AS1_THE 2; in 2.4 M sodium malonate pH 7.0 for AS1_TH 1 (P 61 2 2); and in 1.8 M ammonium citrate tribasic pH 7.0 for AS1_TH 2 (P 21 21 21).

Diffraction data were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source II beamline 17-ID-1 (FMX/AMX), the Advanced Light Source beamline 821/822 or the Advanced Photon Source NECAT 24ID-C. X-ray intensities and data reduction were evaluated and integrated using XDS66 and merged and scaled using Pointless or Aimless in the CCP4 program suite67. Structure determination and refinement starting phases were obtained by molecular replacement with Phaser68, using the designed model for the structures. After molecular replacement, the models were improved using phenix.autobuild with rebuild-in-place to false and using simulated annealing. Structures were refined in PHENIX69. Model building was performed using Coot70. The final model was evaluated using MolProbity71. Data collection and refinement statistics are provided in Extended Data Tables 1–3.

Spin-label modelling and distance distribution predictions were performed as previously described33 using chiLife72 with the off-rotamer sampling method73. Site pair selections were performed as previously described33. Host protein variants containing cysteine residues at the selected sites were purified as described above, except that 0.5 mM TCEP was included in the lysis buffer and the first two Ni-NTA resin washes, and the proteins were labelled immediately after elution from the Ni-NTA resin: to the elutions, 50 μl of 200 mM of the nitroxide spin label 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSL) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added and allowed to incubate for at least 2 h at room temperature before further purification by SEC. Successful labelling was confirmed using LC–MS. DEER samples were prepared at 20 µM labelled host protein in deuterated solvent buffered by 20 mM Tris at pH 8.0 with 100 mM NaCl and 20% d8-glycerol (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as a glassing agent. When appropriate, target and effector were added to a concentration of 100 µM each. Then, 15–30 µl of each sample was loaded into a quartz capillary (Sutter Instrument, 1.1 mm inner diameter, 1.5 mm outer diameter) and flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at −80 °C until the DEER experiments were performed.

DEER experiments were performed as previously described33. An ELEXSYS E580 spectrometer (Bruker) at Q-band (around 34 GHz) with an EN5107D2 resonator (Bruker) was used for all experiments. The temperature was maintained at 50 K using a cryogen-free cooling system (ColdEdge). The four-pulse DEER sequence was used, using 60-ns Gaussian observer pulses with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 30 ns and a frequency near the centre of the field-swept spectrum and 150-ns sech/tanh probe pulses with centre 80 MHz above the observer frequency, 80 MHz bandwidth and a truncation parameter of 10. All shaped pulses were generated using the SpinJet arbitrary waveform generator (Bruker). Pulse shapes were calculated using PulseShape (https://github.com/stolllab/PulseShape), using both resonator compensation and transmitter nonlinearity compensation. All data were collected using a 2 ms shot repetition time, 8-step phase cycling and τ1 averaging from 400 ns to 528 ns in 16-ns steps. All other experimental parameters (including pump pulse time step, τ2 delays, number of scans and others) were chosen on a per-sample basis and are reported in Supplementary Table 3.

All DEER data were analysed using the DeerExp module of the eprTools Python package (https://github.com/mtessmer/eprTools). All data were fitted using separable nonlinear least squares74. The foreground signal was modelled using Tikhonov regularization with the second derivative operator. The regularization parameter was selected using generalized cross-validation. The background was modelled using a 3D-homogeneous spin distribution. An additional penalty restraining the modulation depth to be low was used to prevent the fitting of long-distance artefacts in the foreground, as was done previously75. Confidence intervals were estimated using bootstrap sampling with 100 samples using a fixed regularization parameter. Fit parameters such as the regularization parameter, the modulation depth and the signal-to-noise ratio are listed in Supplementary Table 3.

Input files for the MD simulation were prepared with CHARMM-GUI76,77, with AF2 structure as the initial structure. A rectangular water box of edge length 10 Å was placed around the protein. The water box contained potassium and chlorine ions of concentration 0.15 M that neutralized the protein's net charge. The ions were placed in the water box using the Monte Carlo method. To model the system, the CHARMM36m force field78 was used. After the explicit solvent system was made, the system was minimized and equilibrated before the production MD run. All three steps were performed with the GROMACS 2020.2 MD engine79,80.

The steepest descent method was used for energy minimization, for 5,000 steps with an energy tolerance of 1000 kJ mol−1 nm−1. The neighbour list was updated every ten steps with a cut-off distance of 1.2 nm. Cut-off was used to calculate Van der Waals interactions with a switch distance of 1.0 nm and a cut-off distance of 1.2 nm. The force was smoothly switched off between the switch distance and the cut-off distance. The fast smooth particle-mesh Ewald method was used to calculate electrostatics with a cut-off distance of 1.0 nm. All bonds with hydrogen atoms were treated as rigid using the linear constraint solver (LINCS) algorithm81.

The equilibration step was performed with a leap-frog algorithm using a time step of 1 fs and a total simulation time of 125 ps. The system was propagated in the NVT ensemble. The temperature was maintained at 303.15 K using the velocity rescaling method. The solute and solvent were coupled with a time constant for coupling of 1 ps. The centre-of-mass translational velocity was removed every 100 steps to prevent the system from drifting. The cut-off schemes for Van der Waals and electrostatic interactions were the same as those used in the minimization step, except that the neighbour list was updated every 20 steps. The velocities were generated from a Maxwell distribution with a temperature of 303.15 K. The same LINCS method was used to constrain the hydrogen atoms during the equilibration step.

The production step was performed with a leap-frog algorithm using a time step of 2 fs and a total simulation time of 1 μs. The trajectories with the same initial equilibrated structure were obtained in triplicate. The system was propagated in the NPT ensemble. The temperature was maintained at 303.15 K using the velocity rescaling method. The solute and solvent were coupled with a time constant of 1 ps. Exponential relaxation pressure coupling and isotropic coupling with a time constant of 5.0 ps was used to maintain the pressure at 1.0 bar. The cut-off schemes for Van der Waals and electrostatic interactions were the same as those used in the minimization step, except that the neighbour list was updated every 20 steps and the Coulomb cut-off distance was set as 1.2 nm. The centre-of-mass velocity removal was the same as that used in the equilibration step. The same LINCS method was used to constrain the hydrogen atoms during the production step.

Analysis of the trajectories, such as RMSD and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) calculations, was performed with MDAnalysis82. To simulate DEER distance distributions from these trajectories, structures along each trajectory were clustered using the Gromos clustering algorithm83 in GROMACS, distance distributions were predicted (using chiLife72 with the off-rotamer sampling method73) for the centre structure of each cluster and the resulting distributions were averaged weighted by the occupancies of their corresponding clusters.

Hinge protein cs201F_E249L (H2) was purified as described above, except that 0.5 mM TCEP was included in the lysis, wash and elution buffers, and the SEC buffer was phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl and 0.5 mM TCEP). To double label with dyes, 50 μM H2 was incubated with 250 μM Alexa Fluor 555 C2 maleimide (donor; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 250 μM Alexa Fluor 647 C2 maleimide (acceptor; Thermo Fisher Scientific), shaking at room temperature for at least 2 h. The reaction was quenched by adding DTT to 10 mM, and the proteins were separated from excess dye by SEC in TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl).

FRET binding experiments were performed at 25 °C in TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl) with 0.05% v/v TWEEN20 in 96-well plates (Corning 3686). Fluorescence intensity was measured using a Synergy Neo2 plate reader, exciting the donor at a 520-nm wavelength and reading acceptor emission at a 665-nm wavelength.

To measure the E2–target on-rate constant, 40 μl H2 at 10 nM was prepared in six wells. To each well, 40 μl E2–target at various concentrations was added and rapidly mixed using a multichannel pipette, and the measurement was started immediately afterwards. The following single exponential decay function was fitted to the measured FRET time courses using nonlinear least-squares minimization,

where S is the modelled fluorescence signal, S0 is the fluorescence at equilibrium, S1 is the amplitude of the change in fluorescence, kapp is the apparent rate constant and t is the time after the start of the measurement. The following linear function was fitted to the apparent rate constants:

where kon and koff are on-rate and off-rate constants and [E2] is the total concentration of E2–target.

To measure the accelerated transfer of E2 from AS114 to H2, 1,067 nM AS114 and 533 nM E2–target were incubated for 15 min to fully cage E2–target in AS114. A control solution of just 1,067 nM AS114 was also prepared. A 37.5-μl quantity of 42.7 nM H2 was prepared in eight wells; 37.5 μl of AS114 + E2–target was added to four wells and 37.5 μl of AS114 was added to the other four wells using a multichannel pipette, and the measurement was started immediately afterwards. Five minutes later, four solutions (5 μl buffer, 100 μM target, 16 μM effector or 100 μM target + 16 μM effector) were added to each set of four wells (each solution to a different well of each set) using a multichannel pipette, and the measurement was immediately continued for 1 h. Mixing components at these concentrations resulted in final concentrations of 500 nM AS114, 250 nM E2–target, 20 nM H2, 1 μM effector and 6 μM target. A baseline drift function of the following form was fitted to the AS114 + buffer data and subtracted from the other time courses:

where S is the modelled fluorescence signal, S0 is the fluorescence at equilibrium, S1 is the amplitude of the change in fluorescence, k is a rate constant, t is the time after the start of the measurement and t1/2 is the time at which the fluorescence has changed by half the full amplitude. AS114 was used because, in state X, it does not clash with E2 extending past the target in E2–target.

Luminescence experiments were performed at 25 °C in TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl) with 0.05% v/v TWEEN20 in 96-well plates (Corning 3686). Luminescence was measured using a Synergy Neo2 plate reader with a LUM filter cube.

To measure rapid breakage of a split luciferase, 111 pM AS1–LgBiT and 22 nM target SmBiT were incubated for one hour to load AS1 with the target and reconstitute the split luciferase. Next, 72 μl of this mixture was added to two wells, then 8 μl of 1/10-diluted Nano-Glo substrate (Promega N1130) and either 10 μM effector and 200 μM target or just 200 μM target was added to these wells using a multichannel pipette, and the measurement was started immediately afterwards. Excess target was included to fully outcompete target–SmBiT to enable measurement of the dissociation rate. Mixing components at these concentrations resulted in final concentrations of 100 pM AS1–LgBiT, 20 nM target–SmBiT, 1 μM effector, 20 μM target and 1/100-diluted Nano-Glo substrate.

To measure rapid analyte sensing, 64 μl of 12.5-pM sensor was added to eight wells, 8 μl of 1/10-diluted Nano-Glo substrate was added to these wells using a multichannel pipette and the measurement was started immediately afterwards. Five minutes later, 8 μl of various concentrations of analyte obtained by tenfold serial dilution was added using a multichannel pipette, and the measurement was immediately continued for 30–60 min. Mixing components at these concentrations resulted in final concentrations of 10 pM sensor and 1/100-diluted Nano-Glo substrate. The analytes were target, effector or SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Acro Biosystems SPD-C52H3). Figure 4e shows a time course with 800 nM SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

For cell-surface labelling, receptors were N-terminally fused to suitable tags using a pSems vector including the signal sequence of Igκ (pSems leader). Common gamma chain (γc) was fused to the ALFA-tag84 and IL-2Rβ was fused to nonfluorescent monomeric GFP (mXFP)85. HeLa cells (ACC 57, DSMZ) were cultured as previously described86. For transient transfection, cells were incubated for 4–6 h with a mixture of 150 mM NaCl, 10 µl of 1 mg ml−1 polyethylenimine (PEI MAX, Polysciences 24765), 200 ng of DNA of pSems leader ALFA-tag-γc and 2,800 ng of pSems leader mXFPe1-IL-2Rβ87. Labelling, washing and subsequent imaging were performed after mounting the coverslips into custom-made incubation chambers with a volume of 1 ml. Cells were equilibrated in medium with fetal bovine serum (FBS) but lacking phenol red, supplemented with an oxygen scavenger and a redox-active photoprotectant (0.5 mg ml−1 glucose oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.04 mg ml−1 catalase (Roche), 5% w/v glucose, 1 μM ascorbic acid and 1 μM methylviologene) to minimize photobleaching88.

Selective cell-surface receptor labelling was achieved by using anti-GFP and anti-ALFA-tag nanobodies (NBs), which were site-specifically labelled by maleimide chemistry via a single cysteine residue at their C termini88. Anti-ALFA NB labelled with Cy3B (degree of labelling (DOL): 1.06) and anti-GFP NB labelled with ATTO 643 (DOL: 1.0) were added at concentrations of 3 nM each, at least 10 min before imaging. Coverslips were precoated with poly-l-lysine-graft-poly(ethylene glycol) to minimize unspecific binding of NBs and were functionalized with RGD peptide for efficient cell adhesion89.

During the imaging experiments, ASNeo2 was used at 100 nM, and 10 μM effector was used to induce receptor dissociation.

Dual-colour imaging was performed by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy using an inverted microscope (IX83, Olympus) equipped with a spectral image splitter (QuadView, Photometrics) and an EMCCD camera (iXon Ultra, Andor) as described in detail elsewhere90. Fluorophores were excited by sequential illumination with a 561-nm laser (2RU-VFL-P-2000-560-B1R, 2,000 mW, MPB Communications) and a 642-nm laser (2RU-VFL-P-2000-642-B1R, 2,000 mW, MPB Communications). Alternating laser excitation was achieved with a simple micro-controller (Arduino Uno) and open-source acquisition software91 synchronizing laser shuttering with an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF; AA.AOTFnC-400.650-TN, AA Opto Electronic) and camera triggering. For long-term tracking experiments, 1,500 frames per channel were acquired at 40 fps. The resulting image stacks were divided into five-frame stacks and dimerization was determined for each stack. For Fig. 5f, three time courses, each normalized to its average initial relative dimerization, are overlaid for each condition. For all other tracking experiments, 200 frames per channel were acquired at 40 fps and dimerization was determined over the whole image stack.

Dual-colour single-molecule co-tracking time-lapse images were evaluated using an in-house-developed MATLAB software (SLIMfast4C, https://zenodo.org/record/5712332)88. After channel registration based on calibration with fiducial markers, molecules were localized using the multi-target tracking algorithm92. Immobile emitters were filtered out by spatio-temporal cluster analysis93. Frame-by-frame co-localization within a cut-off radius of 150 nm was applied followed by tracking of co-localized emitters using the utrack algorithm94. Molecules co-diffusing for ten frames or more were then identified as co-localized. Relative levels of co-localization were determined on the basis of the fraction of co-localized particles relative to all localizations in the ALFA-γc channel (561 nm). Diffusion properties were determined from the pooled single trajectory using mean squared displacement analysis for all trajectories with a lifetime greater than ten frames. Diffusion constants were determined from the mean squared displacement by linear regression. Relative dimerization was estimated by:

FRET efficiencies were evaluated using an in-house-developed MATLAB software (provided and described in detail elsewhere as supplementary software90). In brief, alternating laser excitation FRET experiments provide three separated emission channels: directly excited donor \({D}_{{D}_{{\rm{ex}}}}^{{D}_{{\rm{em}}}}\) and acceptor \({A}_{{A}_{{\rm{ex}}}}^{{A}_{{\rm{em}}}}\) channels, as well as a sensitized FRET \({F}_{{D}_{{\rm{ex}}}}^{{A}_{{\rm{em}}}}\) channel. First, channels were aligned by calibration with fiducial markers. Then, after applying a single-molecule localization algorithm95, single-molecule intensities were determined from background subtracted images (\({I}_{{D}_{{\rm{ex}}}}^{{D}_{{\rm{em}}}}\), \({I}_{{A}_{{\rm{ex}}}}^{{A}_{{\rm{em}}}}\), \({I}_{{D}_{{\rm{ex}}}}^{{A}_{{\rm{em}}}}\)). To evaluate FRET efficiencies, donor–acceptor pairs were co-localized with an optimized search radius. For these pairs, the apparent FRET efficiency was calculated by:

To achieve accurate FRET efficiencies, standard further corrections were applied. These include the donor leakage coefficient, cross-talk-corrected proximity ratio and the correction factor γ (refs. 90,96).

Human NK (YT-1) cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 complete medium, supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, minimum essential non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES and penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco). For the flow-cytometry-based pSTAT5 detection assay, 2–5 × 105 IL-2Rα-positive YT-1 cells were seeded in 350 µl of medium per well in a 96-well plate. The cells were stimulated with 1 nM ASNeo2 or Neo2 for 5 min at 37 °C. As a control, 50 µl of untreated YT-1 cells were set aside at the start of each experiment and evaluated after 45 min alongside the treated cells. After stimulation, all cells were transferred to three separate wells containing a control (no treatment), 10 μM effector or 40 μM ruxolitinib. One-seventh of the cells (50 µl) were resuspended in 17 µl of 16% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for immediate fixation. This process was repeated at 5-, 10-, 15-, 30- and 45-min intervals. After all of the time points were fixed, the cells were refixed in 4% PFA for 15 min at room temperature. After fixation, the cells were washed once with PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (PBSA) and permeabilized with 100% methanol for 45 min at 4 °C. After permeabilization, the cells were washed twice with PBSA and stained for one hour at room temperature using Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated phospho-STAT5 (Tyr694) rabbit monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 9365, clone C71E5) diluted 1:100. After three washing steps, the cells were analysed using a CytoFlex S flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Data were analysed with CytExpert software, and cells were gated on SSC-A versus FSC-A. Each experiment was done in triplicate, and the results were analysed accordingly.

For Fig. 5g, pSTAT5 signal is normalized to the background level. For Fig. 5h, n = 3 time courses were normalized to the signal at time 0 (just before effector addition) and a baseline signal was determined by the average of this normalized pSTAT5 of the untreated cells, then each time course was renormalized to this baseline signal. Some batches of cells were unresponsive to stimulation; data from these batches were excluded from analysis.

HeLa cells for single-molecule imaging were sourced from the DSMZ (ACC 57); YT-1 (CD25+) cells were sourced from ATCC. Cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling. HeLa cells tested negative for mycoplasma contamination by PCR.

Primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from a healthy donor by leukapheresis were thawed and resuspended at a cell density of 2 × 106 cells per ml in T cell medium, which contained RPMI 1640 (Gibco), FBS (10% v/v, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), HEPES (25 mM, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), penicillin–streptomycin (1% v/v, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), sodium pyruvate (1% v/v, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), MEM non-essential amino acids solution (1% v/v, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 2-mercaptoethanol (0.1% v/v, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and supplemented with human IL-2 (100 U ml−1). For human T cell activation, cells were activated with plate-bound anti-human CD3ε (1 μg ml−1, clone OKT-3, BioXCell) and soluble anti-human CD28 (5 μg ml−1, clone 9.3, BioXCell) for 48 h. Cells were then expanded in T cell medium with human IL-2 (100 U ml−1) for eight days. On day 9, IL-2 was withdrawn for 36 h, after which cells were resuspended at 1 × 106 cells per ml and stimulated with ASNeo2 (1 nM or 5 nM) for either 5 or 25 min, as indicated. Effector peptide (10 μM) was then added to terminate signalling. After 48 or 72 h, cells were collected for counting and phenotypic analysis by flow cytometry.

For Fig. 5i,j, cells were stimulated with 1 nM ASNeo2. For Fig. 5k–n, cells were stimulated with 5 nM ASNeo2.

For surface-marker staining, cells were collected into U-bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific), blocked with Human TruStain FcX (BioLegend) and incubated with the indicated antibodies at 4 °C for 20 min, followed by live–dead staining by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were then washed and resuspended with FACS buffer (PBS containing 0.2 % BSA; Sigma-Aldrich) for flow-cytometry analyses. For phospho-STAT staining, primary human T cells were rested in T cell medium lacking IL-2 for 24 h before signalling assays. Cells were plated in a 96-well round-bottom plate in 50 μl T cell medium. Cells were stimulated with 50 µl ASNeo2 for 5 min or 25 min, followed by the addition of effector peptide and incubation for another 20 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated by fixation with 1.5% PFA for 15 min at room temperature with agitation. Cells were washed and permeabilized with ice-cold 100% methanol for 60 min on ice. Afterward, cells were washed with FACS buffer before staining with pSTAT5 antibodies for one hour at 4 °C in the dark. Cells were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer for flow-cytometry analyses. For caspase-3 staining, cells were first stained for surface markers and Zombie Violet Fixable Dye (BioLegend), followed by staining with a FITC Active Caspase-3 Apoptosis Kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For transcription factor staining, cells were first stained for surface markers and Zombie Violet Fixable Dye, then fixed and permeabilized using a Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were subsequently incubated with the indicated antibodies for intracellular staining. Detection was performed using a CytoFlex (Beckman Coulter), and data were analysed with FlowJo (v.10.10.0).

The following antibodies or staining reagents were purchased from BioLegend: human CD3 (OKT3, 317324), human GATA3 (W19195B, 386906), human CD69 (FN50, 310932), human CD25 (BC96, 302611), human BCL2 (100, 658708), human Ki-67 (Ki-67, 350526), Human TruStain FcX (422302) and Zombie Violet Fixable Viability Kit (423114). The following antibodies or staining reagents were purchased from BD Biosciences: pSTAT5 (47/Stat5, 612599), and BD Pharmingen FITC Active Caspase-3 Apoptosis Kit (571606). DAPI was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific.

Antibodies were diluted 1:200 for surface markers (CD3, CD28, CD69 and CD25), 1:100 for intracellular proteins (GATA3, Ki-67 and BCL2) and 1:50 for pSTAT and caspase-3 staining.

Antibodies were validated by the manufacturers using flow cytometry.

Human T cells on day 9 after activation were subjected to IL-2 starvation for 36 h. The unstimulated control cells were maintained in culture without IL-2. For transient IL-2 signalling, cells were stimulated with ASNeo2 (5 nM) for 25 min, followed by the addition of effector peptide (10 μM) to terminate signalling. For sustained signalling, ASNeo2 (5 nM) was continuously maintained in the culture medium. Total RNA was extracted using the Quick-RNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with random primers. qPCR was performed using TaqMan master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System. BCL2 expression was measured using the TaqMan BCL2 assay, and gene expression was normalized to GAPDH (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Relative expression levels were calculated using the ΔΔCt method.

Human T cells on day 8 after activation were subjected to IL-2 starvation for 36 h. The unstimulated control cells were maintained in culture without IL-2. For transient IL-2 signalling, cells were stimulated with ASNeo2 (5 nM) for 25 min, followed by the addition of effector peptide (10 μM) to terminate signalling. For sustained signalling, ASNeo2 (5 nM) was continuously maintained in the culture medium. After six hours, cells were collected, and total RNA was extracted using the Quick-RNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research). RNA libraries were prepared using a poly(A) enrichment-based mRNA library preparation kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on the NovaSeq X Plus Series (PE150). Reads were aligned to the reference genome (GRCh38) using Rsubread, and gene expression was quantified with featureCounts. For analysing pathway enrichment, gene set co-regulation analysis (GESECA) was performed with hallmark gene sets from the Human Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). To reduce redundancy, we performed hierarchical clustering of hallmark gene sets with Jaccard's distance to yield eight gene-set clusters with minimal gene overlaps. Only one gene set with the lowest false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P value per cluster is shown in Fig. 5. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2, with FDR-adjusted P < 0.05 as a threshold for differential expression. Heat maps were created using normalized counts of genes identified as differentially upregulated or downregulated in both sustained versus unstimulated and transient versus unstimulated comparisons.

The main-text SPR, circular dichroism, FP, FRET and luminescence experiments, and also a subset of the DEER and SEC experiments, were performed twice (SPR in Figs. 2d,h and 4b; FRET in Fig. 4c; and SEC in Supplementary Fig. 9a) or three times (SPR in Fig. 2a,e–g; FP in Fig. 4b and Supplementary Figs. 5c and 12; luminescence in Fig. 4d,e; SEC in Supplementary Fig. 6b; and DEER with AS1 in Extended Data Fig. 2) to ensure reproducibility and low variance, and one representative experiment was reported owing to low variance among replicates. Having established low variance for these experiments, some similar measurements reported in the Supplementary Information were performed once. For all microscopy, cell staining, qPCR and RNA-seq experiments, three or four independent biological replicates were performed unless otherwise noted in the figure legend. All attempted replications of all experiments were successful, with the exception that some batches of YT-1 cells were unresponsive to stimulation; the findings in Fig. 5h were not observed with those batches. Allocation was random. No sample size calculations were performed; rather the sample sizes were chosen based on experience and were sufficient for the important observed differences between groups to be strongly statistically significant.

a, Crystal structure of AS5 alone (grey) overlaid with the design model of AS5 in state X (blue). Inset shows a detailed view of side chains in the partially open effector-binding cleft. b, Cocrystal structure of AS5 and peptide effector (grey) overlaid with the design model of the AS5–effector complex in state Y (AS5 in blue, effector in orange). Inset shows the same view of the side chains in the effector-binding cleft as in a. c, Design model of AS1 in state X (blue) aligned to the target (pink), showing a minor clash. d, Three cocrystal structures of AS1 (with intact cleft) and target with methylated lysines (grey) overlaid with the AF2 model of the target–AS1 complex in state X (AS1 in blue, target in pink), showing fluctuation in the target binding conformation.

a, Raw DEER traces (black), foreground fits (colours), and background fits (grey) for AS1 and AS114 with all combinations of target and effector. Experiments on complexes included the target, effector, or both in excess over the host at concentrations higher than required to fully form the complex (Supplementary Fig. 9), and spin labels were placed far from the target and effector binding sites. Thus, changes in the DEER distance distributions with different combinations of target and effector should only reflect changes in host conformation. b, Distance distributions from experiment (colours) and simulated from the structural state represented by the cartoons (black). For AS1, the simulated and experimental distance distributions agree well, further validating that each state adopts its designed conformation. For AS114, the simulations consistently overestimate the experimental distribution by ~5 Å, but the shift in the distance distributions with the effector compared to those without validates the designed conformational change. c, Experimental distance distributions of all states, coloured corresponding to b. For both AS1 and AS114, the ternary complex distribution (green) aligns with the host–effector complex distribution (orange) and not with the host alone (blue) or target–host complex (pink) distributions, confirming that the ternary complex is primarily in state Y. b,c, Lines represent the distance distribution which best fits the time domain data; shaded regions represent 95% confidence intervals from bootstrapping (Methods).

a, The Cα RMSD of the MD trajectories from the crystal structure (grey) is lower than from the aligned clashing design models of target and host–effector complex (black), showing that the MD simulations strain away from the clashing state in a manner similar to the crystal structure. b, Cα RMSD of the switch (blue) and target (pink) from their position in the crystal structure when the entire structures are aligned. Compared to trajectories 1 and 2, trajectory 3 shows reduced target deformation and increased switch deformation, showing that these trajectories differ in where they localize strain to resolve the clash. c, Per-residue Cα RMSF of the host (blue), target (pink), and effector (orange) in the ternary complex computed from each trajectory. The clashing region of the target (highlighted in grey) shows considerable flexibility, according with this region being disordered in the crystal structure. d, Comparison of MD simulations to experimental data. Left, crystal conformation of the ternary complex (grey) aligned to representative conformations from each MD trajectory (red, yellow, and light blue). DEER spin-label positions are shown in green. In the crystal structure, the clashing region on the target is disordered. In the MD simulations, although flexible, this region remains mostly ordered, causing additional deformation compared to the crystal structure. Illustrating the differences in strain localization among trajectories shown in b, in the first two trajectories (red and yellow), the switch conformation aligns with the crystal structure and the target deforms more; in the third trajectory (light blue), the target conformation aligns with the crystal structure and the switch deforms instead. Right, experimentally measured DEER distance distribution of the ternary complex (green line representing the best fit to the time domain data and shaded region representing 95% confidence interval from bootstrapping (Methods)) and distance distributions simulated from the crystal structure (grey line) or MD trajectories (dashed lines, colours correspond to the conformations shown at left). The distance distribution simulated from the crystal structure aligns with the left peak in the experimental distance distribution, whereas the distance distributions simulated from the MD trajectories span the experimental distance distribution, suggesting that these trajectories more fully sample the space of ternary complex dynamics.

a, Ratios of fold accelerations in the forward direction to those in the reverse direction, given by the equation: acceleration ratio = (koff,T:HE/koff,T:H) ÷ (koff,TH:E/koff,H:E). Acceleration ratios corresponding to designs with asymmetric distributions of strain are coloured orange, and to symmetric blue. b, Plot of forward vs reverse acceleration ratios, with linear fits for the symmetric and asymmetric groups. Note that on a log-log plot, the slope of a straight line passing through the origin becomes the y-intercept. c, For each design, design model of host–effector complex in state Y (blue and orange) aligned to the target (pink) to show the designed allosteric clash, and (grey) AF2 prediction of the target position relative to the switch in the ternary complex to show how the clash resolves through global strain. The target deforms downward in designs with an asymmetric distribution of strain, shearing the beta sheet, whereas it deforms outward in designs with a more symmetric distribution of strain, bending the beta sheet. d, Comparison of the AS1 binder–target interface (left) and switch–effector interface (right) (aligned at the host side) in the binary (colours) and ternary (grey) complex conformations, all from crystal structures, showing the binder–target interface deforms substantially more than the switch–effector interface in the ternary complex.

a, Design model of E2–target, comprising the target LHD101A (with mutations R43V and V69Q) fused to the effector peptide “E2” (cs201B) for hinge cs201. E2 is coloured green and LHD101A is coloured pink. b, Design models of E2–target (green/pink) bound to AS114 (blue) in state X showing no clash (left) and in state Y with the effector peptide (orange) showing a strong clash (right). c, Design models of the reporter hinge “H2” (cs201F with mutation E249L (sticks) which increases E2 on-rate and labelled with Alexa Fluors 555 and 647 at positions indicated by stars) in state X (left) and in state Y with E2–target (right). AS114 and H2 would overlap considerably if simultaneously bound to E2–target, so their binding should be mutually exclusive: AS114 should cage E2 until its release by the effector. d, Kinetics of E2–target and H2 association, measured by a change in FRET efficiency due to the conformational change in H2 upon binding. (Left) FRET time courses (normalized to the initial signal) with varying concentrations of E2–target and 5 nM H2; data (circles) fit with single exponentials (lines). (Right) apparent on-rate constants plotted against E2–target concentration (circles) and a linear fit. The value of the association rate constant (5e + 4 M−1s−1) is higher than the reported value (4.5e + 3 M−1s−1) for the original hinge cs201F with effector cs201B, suggesting that mutation E249L on H2 biases its conformational pre-equilibrium toward state Y to increase the apparent association rate. e, Additional data for the kinetically governed chain reaction shown in Fig. 4c. In the grey control time course, 500 nM AS114 was added to 20 nM H2, then 1 μM effector and 6 μM target was added at time 0, showing that none of these components bind to H2 to cause a change in FRET signal. In the other time courses, pre-incubated 500 nM AS114 and 250 nM E2–target was added to 20 nM H2, then buffer (blue), 1 μM effector (green), 6 μM target (pink), or both (orange) were added at time 0. A baseline drift (obtained from 500 nM AS114 after adding 20 nM H2 then at time 0 adding buffer) was subtracted from each time course, and time courses were normalized to the initial signal. The chain reaction proceeds faster when just excess target is added, probably due to blocking rebinding of E2–target to AS114 after transient dissociation39, but this effect is insufficient to achieve full acceleration. The chain reaction also proceeds faster when just effector is added, but probably due to transient rebinding of E2–target to re-form the strained ternary complex, this also does not achieve full acceleration. Adding both effector (to accelerate E2–target dissociation from AS114) and excess target (to prevent E2–target rebinding to AS114) is required to fully accelerate the chain reaction. Note that if a single-chain effector is desired to fully accelerate the chain reaction, the effector and target could be flexibly fused into a single construct. Such a multivalent effector would be reminiscent of CITED2, whose multivalency enables rapid and unidirectional competition against HIF-1α (ref. 102).

a, Structural model of the best SARS-CoV-2 sensor construct, comprising AScov (blue), the SmBiTgraft peptide with the effector (orange) and grafted SmBiT (green), LgBiT (grey or cyan), and flexible linkers (black). In this design, SmBiT is caged in a helical conformation when SmBiTgraft is bound to the switch and is free to reconstitute the luciferase when SmBiTgraft is released. To form SmBiTgraft, SmBiT was grafted onto the effector peptide such that most of its hydrophobic residues are buried within the switch–SmBiTgraft interface when in the bound helical conformation. Because the original effector peptide binds so strongly to the switch, it could accommodate replacing some of its interface residues with residues from SmBiT without reducing its affinity so much that it no longer effectively cages the SmBiT. b, SPR data showing sfGFP-SmBiTgraft binding to AS0 (blue and orange, association phase), slow subsequent dissociation in the absence of target (blue), and rapid subsequent dissociation upon addition of 10 μM target (orange) caused by rapid target binding to form a transient ternary complex, causing the spike at the beginning of the dissociation phase. c–f, Rapidly sensing the target through a facilitated dissociation mechanism (top), slowly sensing the effector limited by the slow base exchange rate of SmBiTgraft between binding AS0 and LgBiT (middle), and rapidly sensing the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with facilitated dissociation (bottom). c, Schematics showing the mechanism of sensing. d, Luminescence time courses (normalized to the initial signal) of 10 pM sensor construct then at time 0 adding varying concentrations of analyte (target, effector, or SARS-CoV-2 RBD); data (colours) fit (black) with single exponentials up to the maximum signal for time courses which showed appreciable signal increase. In some time courses, signal slowly decreases due to depletion of luciferase substrate. e, Luminescence signal fold change plotted against analyte concentration. f, Sensor response rate constant plotted against analyte concentration for time courses that showed appreciable signal increase.

a, Schematic depiction of the labelling strategy for single-molecule tracking experiments. b, Single-molecule trajectories of IL-2Rβ (red), γc (blue) and ASNeo2-induced heterodimers (magenta). c, Data from Fig. 5e as box plots to display datapoint variation including Neo2 (+/- effector) (green and orange, left side) and single-molecule tracking experiments with labelled ASNeo2 and γc (right side). Sample sizes and independent repeats are: unstimulated: 37 and 3; ASNeo2: 32 and 3; ASNeo2 + Effector: 33 and 3; Neo2: 44 and 4; Neo2 + Effector: 26 and 2; labelled ASNeo2: 21 and 2; labelled ASNeo2 + Effector: 18 and 2. d, Relative dimerization in relation to receptor cell surface density ratio indicates that high dimerization data variance is caused by differing IL-2Rβ to γc ratios at the plasma membrane. Even at high γc excess, effector-bound ASNeo2 shows no residual affinity for γc. e, Diffusion properties of IL-2Rβ and γc are reverted to the ground state after addition of effector. f, Immobile particles are increased upon stimulation, but not decreased after effector addition, potentially indicating receptors internalizing in membrane proximal endosomes. For e,f, the left box always corresponds to IL-2Rβ and the right one to γc. Sample sizes for d–f are as in c. g, Normalized localization density over time confirms minimal single-molecule bleaching in long-term single-molecule tracking experiments. Sample sizes and independent repeats are: without Effector: 5 and 5; with Effector: 3 and 3. h,i, Dissociation of ASNeo2-induced IL-2Rβ/γc dimers at the cell surface upon addition of 10 µM effector as detected by time-lapse single-molecule co-tracking (h) with colour-coded corresponding co-trajectories (i). j,k, Conformational change of ASNeo2 bound to the cell-surface receptor probed by smFRET. j, FRET efficiency histograms for ASNeo2 E4C/K211C labelled with Cy3B and ATTO643 bound to cells expressing IL-2Rβ and γc in the absence (blue) and presence (yellow) of 10 µM effector. Sample sizes are: without Effector: 7; with Effector: 5. k, smFRET co-localizations of one individual cell before the effector was added (left) and after it was added (right) colour-coded for FRET efficiency, highlighting the observation of individual molecules. Statistics for c,e,f were performed using two-sided two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests (ns, not significant, P values noted). Box plots show the distribution of the dataset, highlighting the median, quartiles, and outliers, with whiskers extending to the range limits. Scale bars in b,i: 5 µm.

a, Design models of ASNeo2 and selected cyclic permutations in state X, rainbow-coloured from N terminus (blue) to C terminus (red) to illustrate the protein topology. In ASNeo2, the switch is at the N terminus and Neo2 is at the C terminus. In the cyclic permutations, although the relative position of the switch and Neo2 changes minimally, the switch is in the middle of the protein, part of Neo2 is at the N terminus, and the other part is at the C terminus. This way, the regulatory switch cannot degrade without also breaking Neo2. b, SEC purifications performed on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column. The cyclic permutations are prone to aggregation during expression, but distinct monomer peaks can be picked out. c, Fast effector-concentration-dependent dissociation of γc from the ASNeo2–IL-2Rβ–γc complex upon addition of peptide effector. Data (grey) fit (colours) as described in methods (neglecting the accumulation modelling because accumulation on the SPR surface was negligible with these proteins). d, Rate constants of facilitated γc dissociation computed from the model fit by ln(2)÷{half-time of γc–host interaction} plotted against effector concentration (circles) and fit with hyperbolic equations (black lines).

Human T cells were stimulated with 1 nM (a–g) or 5 nM (i) ASNeo2 for 5 min (a–h), 30 min (h), or 25 min (i) or left untreated as a control. Signalling was either sustained by continued ASNeo2 treatment or terminated by the addition of 10 μM effector. Cells were collected for counting and phenotypic analysis by flow cytometry after 72 h (b,c; n = 4) or 48 h (a,e–g; n = 4), for pSTAT signalling analysis by flow cytometry after 20 min (h, n = 3), or for RNA-seq analysis after 6 h (i, n = 3). a, Changes in viable T cell counts from 0 h to 48 h across each group. b,c, Representative flow-cytometry histogram of CFSE (b) and quantitative analysis of divided cells (c). d, Frequencies of live T cells. e, Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of Ki-67, CD25, GATA3, CD69, and BCL2. f,g, Representative flow-cytometry plots (f) and quantitative analysis of caspase-3+ cells (g; n = 4). h, Dose-dependent pSTAT5 curves. i, Transcripts per million (TPM) of CDK4 and POLD2 in the MYC_TARGETS_V1 gene set (left); TPM of DOCK2 and KIF1B in the MITOTIC_SPINDLE gene set (right). a,c–e,g, Statistics were obtained from ANOVA with two-sided Tukey's post-test (ns, not significant (P > 0.05), *P = 0.04, **P = 0.001, ***P = 0.0002, ****P < 0.0001). Lines or bars represent means; error bars represent s.e.m. (a,h,i) or SD (c–e,g). n refers to biologically independent samples.

Example of IL-2Rβγc facilitated dissociation on the cell surface. Microscopy recording showing single-molecule trajectories of fluorescently labelled IL-2Rβ (red) and γc (blue) on the plasma membrane of live cells. The cells had been incubated with 100 nM ASNeo2, causing co-localization of one IL-2Rβγc pair (circled in white) within this frame. Seven seconds into the recording, 10 μM effector was added, leading to γc dissociation four seconds later. Scale bar, 100 nm.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

One of the hardest things about exploring the quantum world is that many of the phenomena in this “invisible” realm occur at mind-bogglingly small scales.

Take, for example, what is known as the quantum Hall effect. First discovered in 1980 by German physicist Klaus von Klitzing, this effect describes the behavior of electrons (under the influence of a magnetic field and approaching absolute zero temperatures) as they pass through 2D materials, such as graphene. Usually, you'd expect the electrons to experience resistance and scatter, but under these conditions, they formed lossless energy states locked along the material's boundary. 

This quantization of electrical resistance, known as an “edge state,” is particularly useful if you want to create exotic materials free of electrical resistance. But there's just one problem. 

“These states occur over femtoseconds, and across fractions of a nanometer, which is incredibly difficult to capture,” Richard Fletcher, an assistant professor at MIT, said in a press statement. A femtosecond is one quadrillionth of a second. “The beauty is seeing with your own eyes physics which is absolutely incredible but usually hidden away in materials and unable to be viewed directly.”

To actually study this quantum interaction on a more reasonable scale, Fletcher—along with his colleagues at MIT's Research Laboratory of Electronics and the MIT-Harvard Center for Ultracold Atoms—decided on a novel method to essentially scale up this phenomenon using a cloud of ultracold sodium atoms instead of electrons. 

According to the researchers, this allowed the team to watch these edge states form “over milliseconds and microns,” which are much more manageable experimental parameters. The results of the study were published in the journal Nature Physics.

To create this quantum interaction on a bigger scale took a large amount of experimental ingenuity. The team used one million ultracold sodium atoms and essentially trapped them in a complex set-up of lasers. However, to simulate the experience of living in a flat space, the researchers also spun them like “riders on an amusement park Gravitron.”

“The trap is trying to pull the atoms inward, but there's centrifugal force that tries to pull them outward,” Fletcher said. “The two forces balance each other, so if you're an atom, you think you're living in a flat space, even though your world is spinning. There's also a third force, the Coriolis effect, such that if they try to move in a line, they get deflected. So these massive atoms now behave as if they were electrons living in a magnetic field.”

Scientists then defined the “edge” of this gaseous material by introducing a laser, which formed a wall around the atoms. Once atoms encountered this light, they flowed in just one direction—much like electrons at ultra-small quantum scales. 

“You can imagine these are like marbles that you've spun up really fast in a bowl, and they just keep going around and around the rim of the bowl,” Martin Zwierlein, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “There is no friction. There is no slowing down, and no atoms leaking or scattering into the rest of the system. There is just beautiful, coherent flow.”

To test these atoms' resistances, the team then placed obstacles—such as a point of light—in their paths, and the atoms passed by without any measurable resistance. 

Now that scientists have a reliable stand-in for this quantum process, future experiments can push these interactions to the “edge” and begin to explore unknown frontiers of this fascinating piece of quantum physics.

Metrics details

Small molecular food components contribute to the health benefits of diets rich in fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices. The cellular mechanisms by which noncaloric bioactives promote healthspan are not well understood, limiting their use in disease prevention. Here, we deploy a whole-organism, high-content screen in zebrafish to profile food-derived compounds for activation of autophagy, a cellular quality control mechanism that promotes healthy aging. We identify thymol and carvacrol as activators of autophagy and mitophagy through a transient dampening of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Chemical stabilization of thymol-induced mitochondrial depolarization blocks mitophagy activation, suggesting a mechanism originating from the mitochondrial membrane. Supplementation with thymol prevents excess liver fat accumulation in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, improves pink-1-dependent heat stress resilience in Caenorhabditis elegans, and slows the decline of skeletal muscle performance while delaying epigenetic aging in SAMP8 mice. Thus, terpenoids from common herbs promote autophagy during aging and metabolic overload, making them attractive molecules for nutrition-based healthspan promotion.

Despite an extraordinary increase in lifespan over the past 170 years1, the prevalence of chronic diseases among the rapidly growing population of older adults remains high due to environmental, lifestyle and nutritional factors2. Among these, inadequate nutrition makes a major contribution to the onset and progression of noncommunicable diseases and mortality. The intake of excess calories, as well as the overconsumption or underconsumption of specific food and nutrient groups, has been associated with a wide range of negative health outcomes3. Prevention through nutritional approaches, sometimes referred to as ‘food as first medicine', is therefore gaining importance in lowering the burden of noncommunicable diseases4. Beyond recommendations for adequate portion sizes and balanced consumption of nutrient-dense foods, specific dietary patterns are effective tools for disease prevention. For instance, caloric restriction and regimens under the umbrella term of intermittent fasting, such as alternate-day fasting, 5:2 fasting and time-restricted eating, show promise in promoting healthy aging not only through weight loss but also through other mechanisms independent of changes in weight5,6,7,8. At the cellular level, various molecular adaptations promote the health benefits of caloric restriction and intermittent fasting, among which the activation of autophagy is believed to be a principal mechanism explaining their geroprotective effects9. Autophagy prevents proteotoxicity and cellular damage by recycling protein aggregates and dysfunctional organelles, leading to improved organism resilience against metabolic challenges and other age-related cellular stressors10. The requirement for intact autophagy to mediate the benefits of caloric restriction in extending healthspan and lifespan has been demonstrated by genetic loss-of-function experiments in a wide range of experimental models (including yeast, worms and flies) carrying deletions in genes related to autophagy11. Similar findings have been confirmed in mammals. For example, genetic ablation of autophagy in the liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle or hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin neurons of mice abolishes the system-wide beneficial effects of intermittent fasting, suggesting a conserved role of autophagy for healthy aging in mammals12.

The uptake of dietary patterns that activate autophagy is complicated by the need for low-calorie intake over an extended period before autophagy is efficiently induced. In addition, the efficacy with which fasting activates autophagy shows a large variability across individuals13. To circumvent these challenges, small molecules could be used to mimic the benefits of fasting and caloric restriction while following a diet with normal or only slightly reduced caloric intake14. Such a strategy should ideally be based on food-grade ingredients that activate autophagy and can be used in a dietary context for preventive health before drugs are medically indicated. For example, spermidine, urolithin A and resveratrol have been shown to provide broad health benefits across organ systems, with a remarkable level of conservation across species15,16,17,18,19. However, the number of natural bioactive compounds that can be safely used at efficacious levels in food and beverage formats remains small, limiting the potential to promote autophagy as part of diets that can be widely adopted for disease prevention.

In this study, we developed and deployed a rapid testing approach in zebrafish as a suitable whole-organism model for small-molecule discovery, with the aim of finding food-grade autophagy activators20. Zebrafish have been used to measure autophagy in vivo, providing a vertebrate model that recapitulates organismal complexity21,22. In practice, the use of zebrafish for the discovery of autophagy modulators has been limited by the need for microscopy and the quantification of autophagy in individual animals23,24. In this study, we established an in vivo workflow for the discovery of autophagy modulators using a transgenic construct in which ZsGreen is tagged to the autophagosome-localized protein LC3 (encoded by map1lc3), combined with high-content image acquisition and analysis in live zebrafish. We tested a library of natural bioactive molecules and identified thymol and carvacrol, major components of thyme and oregano, as autophagy inducers in zebrafish, mice and human cells. Mechanistically, thymol transiently lowers the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), triggering a cellular stress response that promotes the recycling of damaged mitochondria. Thymol supplementation reduces hepatic fat content in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, delays age-related phenotypes in worms, and lowers epigenetic age in conjunction with improved muscle performance in a naturally occurring mouse strain affected by premature mobility decline.

Autophagy requires the conjugation of the cytosolic LC3 protein (LC3-I) with the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3-II on the surface of autophagosomes25. The change from a dispersed cytosolic presence of LC3-I to the formation of vesicular structures rich in LC3-II can be exploited in confocal microscopy to visualize autophagosomes. We developed a zebrafish model in which we tagged the fluorescent reporter protein ZsGreen in frame to the 5′ end of map1lc3. To drive the expression of the reporter gene in skeletal muscle, we used the skeletal muscle-specific promoter of actc1b and generated Tg(actc1b:ZsGreen-map1lc3;cryaa:TdTomato) zebrafish, hereafter named actc1b:ZsGreen-LC3 (Fig. 1a,b and Extended Data Fig. 1a). Next, we set up an image acquisition and analysis pipeline that detects LC3-positive puncta for in vivo quantification of autophagosomes (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b). Profiling of zebrafish larvae showed that the number of autophagosomes increased from 3 to 6 days post fertilization (dpf) (Fig. 1c,d). Cotreatment with the lysosomotropic agent ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), an inhibitor of autophagosome degradation, increased the accumulation of LC3 puncta compared to baseline from 4 dpf, demonstrating a bona fide increase in autophagic flux (Fig. 1d)26. This result is consistent with autophagy activation during the transition of zebrafish larvae from the ‘yolk-feeding' stage at 3 dpf to a state of limited energy substrate availability due to yolk consumption at 6 dpf (ref. 27). To enable the discovery of previously unidentified autophagy modulators in vivo, we implemented a semiautomated multistep protocol as summarized in Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1c. We opted for an early time window, with analysis at 3 dpf when endogenous autophagic flux is low. Specifically, we distributed larvae at 2 dpf into 96-well microplates. After incubation with the compound of interest, the larvae were immobilized through treatment with an anesthetic before image acquisition as described above. Following the first acquisition, the anesthetic was washed out and the larvae were treated with NH4Cl before a second round of imaging was performed.

For validation, larvae were treated with rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor with well-established effects on autophagy induction in mammals. mTOR activity was abolished after 20 h of treatment of wild-type larvae, as demonstrated by S6 protein phosphorylation (Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). Accordingly, treatment of actc1b:ZsGreen-LC3 larvae for 16 h enhanced autophagic flux in the absence of NH4Cl, and the same effect was observed following 4 h of incubation with NH4Cl (Fig. 1f,g). Next, we tested the evolutionary conservation of autophagy modulation in zebrafish by performing a pilot screen using a commercial collection of 240 synthetic and natural pharmacophores. Among the seven hits that were identified, three small molecules—ceramide, calpeptin and retinoic acid—have been previously reported to induce autophagy in mammalian cells (Extended Data Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 1)28,29,30.

These results validate zebrafish as a model for quantifying autophagy levels in vivo, while the semiautomatic analysis pipeline provides a rapid workflow for the discovery of autophagy inducers.

To enrich a screening library for molecules with a favorable safety profile for human translation, we next curated a list of natural bioactive compounds from edible sources and endogenous metabolites, including vitamins, bioactive molecules from herbs and spices, and human serum metabolites (Supplementary Table 2). The molecules were screened at concentrations from 10 to 250 µM and were ranked according to their maximum efficacy (Emax) in the presence of NH4Cl (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 2). The analysis included high-content imaging of LC3-positive puncta in more than 2,500 larvae in the presence or absence of NH4Cl. Carvacrol and thymol, terpenoids abundant in essential oils derived from common thyme (Thymus vulgaris) and oregano (Origanum vulgare), were the most potent autophagy activators among all the screened bioactive ingredients (Fig. 2a). Images of actc1b:ZsGreen-LC3 larvae demonstrated an accumulation of LC3 puncta at baseline, with a further increase after the addition of NH4Cl (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 2a). Both molecules showed a dose–response relationship, with substantial effects on autophagy starting from 50 µM for carvacrol and 10 µM for thymol (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). Thymol and carvacrol constitute up to 60% of all phytochemicals in the oil fraction of oregano and thyme31. Therefore, we hypothesized that oregano essential oil, a natural product extracted from dry oregano leaves and containing the monoterpenoids carvacrol, p-cymene and thymol (Extended Data Table 1), exhibits bioactivity related to autophagy. Consistent with this, we observed that treatment with oregano essential oil induced a robust increase in autophagic flux (Fig. 2c). Notably, thymol, carvacrol and oregano essential oil demonstrated similar efficacy to rapamycin at the doses tested, making them promising candidates for exploring autophagy-dependent health benefits. Considering the structural similarity and comparable efficacy of thymol and carvacrol, we chose thymol as the lead ingredient for subsequent experiments, based on the availability of pharmacokinetic studies in humans32. As thymol is metabolized through phase II reactions, we assessed the efficacy of thymol sulfate and thymol glucuronide, the two most prevalent metabolites in human blood after thymol ingestion32. Remarkably, both thymol sulfate and thymol glucuronide induced autophagy similarly to free thymol (Fig. 2d,e), indicating that the conjugation of thymol does not interfere with its bioactivity. Thymol did not affect S6 and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, suggesting that autophagy is not directly activated through these canonical regulatory pathways (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).

In summary, we identified thymol and carvacrol as potent autophagy inducers that are naturally found in oregano and thyme.

We next aimed to determine how thymol induces autophagy and whether the mode of action is conserved across species. Jurkat cells, a human cell line that grows in suspension, can be used to measure autophagic flux through flow cytometry. Treatment with thymol increased the LC3-II signal in the presence of the lysosomal inhibitor starting at 62.5 µM (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Based on previous reports that thymol intercalates into lipid bilayers, we hypothesized that thymol acts at the level of the mitochondrial membrane to activate autophagy33,34,35. Thymol caused a mild decrease in the MMP, as detected by a fluorometric shift in JC-10 emission from orange, which represents the aggregate form, to green, representing the monomeric form, compared to the chemical uncoupler FCCP (Fig. 3c). Cell viability was not affected even in the presence of 250 µM thymol for up to 6 h, suggesting that autophagy is not a result of cellular toxicity (Extended Data Fig. 3b). To confirm similar bioactivity on mitochondrial membranes, we quantified the MMP in Jurkat cells treated with carvacrol and found a comparable effect to that of thymol (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Consistent with membrane depolarization, treatment with thymol and carvacrol increased mitochondrial superoxide generation, suggesting a mechanism that originates at the mitochondrial membrane (Extended Data Fig. 3d).

Changes in the MMP can affect the respiratory chain and modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Therefore, we measured the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in mitochondria purified from mouse livers that were treated ex vivo with a range of thymol doses. Consistent with our previous observation that thymol affects the MMP, we found a dose-dependent effect on mitochondrial respiration with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 295.7 ± 6.7 µM in healthy mitochondria (Fig. 3d). Based on these results, we validated the effects through a different method for quantifying the MMP, in which we used primary mouse adult fibroblasts (MAFs) from the same animal model used for OCR quantification. MAFs were treated with thymol for 24 h and then exposed to the fluorescent dye TMRM, a sensitive marker for MMP changes. As expected, TMRM fluorescence was reduced in thymol-treated cells (Fig. 3e), leading to a significant decrease in the TMRM signal compared to that of the control (Student's t test, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3f). Carvacrol had similar effects on the MMP (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f).

We next asked whether thymol treatment leads to transcriptional adaptations consistent with changes in cellular energy homeostasis. QuantSeq 3′ mRNA sequencing revealed 273 differentially expressed genes in thymol-treated cells compared to controls (Extended Data Fig. 3g and Supplementary Table 3). Unbiased gene set analysis of cellular hallmarks revealed an anti-inflammatory gene expression signature, with three of the top seven pathways indicating downregulated inflammatory signaling, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling via nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and IL-6–JAK–STAT3 signaling (Fig. 3g). Notably, a gene signature consistent with the activation of an unfolded protein response was upregulated, indicative of a cellular stress response (Extended Data Fig. 3h and Supplementary Table 4). Further, a targeted Gene Ontology analysis of 24 curated biological processes related to cellular energy metabolism and autophagy showed upregulation of pathways linked to macroautophagy, autophagy and protein catabolic processes. In contrast, Gene Ontology terms related to the response to starvation were downregulated (Fig. 3h and Supplementary Table 5).

Depolarization of mitochondria is thought to induce autophagy and mitophagy, thereby initiating the targeted removal and replacement of cellular components, which results in improved resilience to energetic stressors and damage36. To be beneficial, this mechanism needs to be transient, without long-term inhibitory effects on cellular respiration, and should be moderate enough to predominantly affect damaged mitochondria. We first tested the kinetics of thymol's effects on mitochondrial respiration by measuring the OCR in zebrafish larvae. In this setup, we compared a vehicle group to a group of animals that were continuously exposed to thymol and to another group in which thymol treatment was replaced by vehicle treatment 30 min before the analysis (Fig. 3i). Consistent with the in vitro experiments in mammalian cells, thymol reduced basal respiration in larvae, with minor effects on uncoupled respiration, suggesting that thymol does not affect maximal respiratory capacity. Importantly, mitochondrial function was fully rescued within 30 min following the removal of thymol (Fig. 3j,k). We hypothesized that transient inhibition of mitochondrial respiration leads to autophagy, thereby removing toxic materials and improving overall cellular quality. To test whether thymol increases organismal resilience, we treated zebrafish larvae with the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone, a toxin whose effects have been previously shown to be counteracted by the activation of autophagy and mitophagy37. Pretreatment of larvae with thymol for 16 h at three different doses reduced rotenone-induced toxicity, indicating that thymol primes cells for improved resilience to mitochondrial damage (Fig. 3l).

In summary, these results show that the effects of thymol on mitochondrial membrane integrity and respiratory function are transient, reversible, and confer protection at both the cellular and organismal levels.

The activation of autophagy and the transient inhibition of mitochondrial respiration suggest that both mechanisms induced by thymol are functionally connected. To test whether thymol's effect of lowering of the MMP triggers the activation of mitophagy in addition to macroautophagy, we obtained MAFs derived from mito-QC reporter mice that carry a tandem mCherry-GFP tag fused to the mitochondrial targeting sequence of the outer mitochondrial membrane protein FIS1 (encoded by Fis1)38 (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Fibroblasts were derived from male mito-QC mice. Of note, all mice used in the study, including those receiving in vivo treatments, were male. When mitophagy is activated in these mice, mitochondria tagged by the reporter construct are delivered to lysosomes, where GFP fluorescence is quenched by the acidic environment of the lumen, resulting in red foci of mitochondria due to the remaining fluorescence emission of the mCherry signal. Treatment with thymol for 24 h led to a strong activation of mitophagy, measured by the appearance of red fluorescent puncta and quantified as the mitophagy index, defined as the ratio of mCherry-positive mitolysosomes to the total number of mCherry-GFP-positive mitochondria (Fig. 4a,b). In contrast, cotreatment with oligomycin, an inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP synthase that blocks proton efflux and prevents mitochondrial depolarization, attenuated the effect of thymol on mitophagy (Fig. 4a,b). Thus, thymol-induced mitochondrial depolarization is necessary to initiate the mitophagy process. Next, we turned to an in vivo mammalian model and performed oral gavage with two administrations of thymol at 20 mg kg−1 per dose using mito-QC reporter mice (Fig. 4c). Gastrocnemius muscle biopsies and liver samples were collected 2 h after the last treatment, and histological sections were imaged to assess mitophagy levels (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 4b). Oral thymol treatment resulted in a striking induction of mitophagy in skeletal muscle, as demonstrated by increases in the mitophagy index and the number of mCherry-positive mitochondria (Fig. 4e,f). In contrast, mitophagy activation in liver samples was similar between the thymol and vehicle groups, potentially limited by the timing of sampling relative to the pharmacodynamics of thymol, or due to the mosaic expression of the transgene as reported previously (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d)38,39.

Taken together, our results show that mitophagy activation by oregano terpenoids occurs both in vitro and in vivo and is triggered by a mechanism that requires mild and transient mitochondrial depolarization.

Autophagy enables the degradation of triglyceride-rich lipid droplets in hepatocytes, protecting against aberrant liver fat accumulation, a common phenotype in aging that is compounded by calorie-dense but nutrient-poor Western diets40. As thymol inhibits the respiratory capacity of liver mitochondria at elevated doses (Fig. 3d), we tested its effects on hepatic macroautophagy and mitophagy by western blot analysis in wild-type mice. Total tissue lysate and mitochondria were purified from liver tissue to determine markers of autophagy and mitophagy in response to oral treatment (Fig. 5a). Thymol increased the autophagic flux, measured as the LC3-II/LC3-I protein ratio, in conjunction with hyperphosphorylation of mitochondrial ubiquitin at the Ser-65 residue, suggesting mitophagy activation through canonical PINK-1/Parkin signaling (Fig. 5b,c). In contrast, the levels of the autophagy target P62 remained unchanged, potentially due to the variable timing with which these markers respond during different stages of the autophagic flux41.

Following this acute study, we set out to test whether thymol prevents the accumulation of excess liver fat in chronic conditions. Groups of mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and supplemented with 20 mg kg−1 of thymol or a vehicle control by gavage for 5 days per week over 8 weeks. A group of mice was fed a standard chow diet and received vehicle treatment by gavage to serve as a reference (Fig. 5d). At the end of the treatment, body weight was higher in mice fed a HFD than in their littermates that were fed a standard diet (Fig. 5e). Thymol had no effects on weight gain (Fig. 5e), body composition (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b) or food intake (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Blood glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were similar between the thymol-treated and control HFD-fed groups (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). In contrast, liver histological analysis revealed robust protection against steatosis and preserved tissue morphology in thymol-treated mice compared to the vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 5f). Oil Red O (ORO) analysis showed that the amount of lipid droplets decreased in the livers of animals treated with thymol, along with a reduction in tissue triglyceride content (Fig. 5g,h). Consistent with an enhancement of autophagy, we observed lower levels of P62, an autophagy cargo adaptor and substrate that becomes depleted in response to increased autophagic flux10 (Fig. 5i,j). No differences between groups were observed for the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, suggesting that autophagic flux stabilizes over the treatment period and leads to the degradation of autophagosomes and their cargo, including P62, without further changes in the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio.

Taken together, oral thymol intake acutely activates liver autophagy and mitophagy, preventing excess liver fat accumulation during a chronic HFD challenge, independent of changes in body weight.

Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-suited model organism for studying epistatic mechanisms that mediate the effects of small-molecule interventions on healthspan42. We first aimed to confirm an evolutionarily conserved effect of thymol and carvacrol on autophagy induction. We treated wild-type worms that carry a transgene in which GFP is fused to the C. elegans ortholog of MAP1LC3, leading to the expression of a GFP::LGG-1 reporter. Worms were exposed to thymol or carvacrol at different life stages and for varying durations of exposure. Thymol and carvacrol increased GFP::LGG-1 puncta in young (day 1) and adult worms in response to lifelong treatment (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig. 6a). The same effect was observed in aged animals (10 days old) treated throughout their lives or in response to a subchronic duration of 72 h (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig. 6a). Notably, autophagy levels in aged C. elegans treated with the terpenoids were robust and comparable to those observed in young worms, despite lower baseline autophagy levels (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig. 6a). Thus, thymol is effective in overcoming age-related declines in autophagy levels. Based on the ability to induce autophagy in C. elegans, we used a transgenic line carrying a mitochondria-targeted Rosella (mtRosella) reporter in the muscle cells of the body wall. This dual-fluorescent reporter coexpresses pH-sensitive GFP (mtGFP) and pH-insensitive DsRed. In this setup, we tested the ability of thymol to activate mitophagy in wild-type worms and pink-1 mutants lacking the membrane-bound PINK-1 protein, which initiates canonical mitophagy upon membrane depolarization43. Thymol robustly increased mitophagy signals in both young and aged worms (Fig. 6b–d). The reversal of age-related autophagy decline was absent in worms lacking functional PINK-1 signaling, demonstrating that thymol signals through canonical mitophagy activation (Fig. 6c,d).

Exposing cells to nonphysiological temperatures induces the expression of heat shock proteins, a group of chaperones that protect cellular components by forming protein aggregates44. We hypothesized that thymol increases resilience to heat stress through the turnover of protein aggregates and damaged mitochondria, thereby reinstating proteostasis that is perturbed by high temperatures. Exposure of C. elegans to a temperature of 37 °C for 4 h sharply reduced their activity score, a measure that assesses animal motility as a readout of recovery from the heat exposure (Fig. 6e–j). Thymol or carvacrol treatments 72 h before the heat shock robustly improved thermotolerance, measured as the percentage of active animals during a time course of 32 h after the thermal shock (Fig. 6e,f). We repeated the same experiment in worms with genetic deletions of daf-16, which is critical for autophagy signaling, and pink-1, the gatekeeper of canonical mitophagy signaling, to test dependency on these pathways45. Thymol did not protect worms deficient in daf-16 and pink-1, indicating that these genes are required for the benefits of thymol (Fig. 6g,h). C. elegans deficient in aak-2, the ortholog of genes encoding proteins of the AMPK complex in vertebrates, also interfered with thymol-dependent motility benefits, consistent with the upstream regulatory role of AMPK in the induction of autophagy and mitophagy46 (Fig. 6i). In contrast, the effects of thymol did not depend on skn-1, which encodes a transcription factor with conserved functions in oxidative stress responses to NRF2 in mammals47, indicating that the protective effects do not rely on reactive oxygen species signaling (Fig. 6j).

Next, we assessed motility as a surrogate for improved healthspan during lifelong treatments in microfluidic chambers. Activity scores improved in worms exposed to thymol at concentrations of 25 and 50 µM from 7 to 10 days of adulthood (Fig. 6k,l). Similar benefits regarding age-related motility were also observed when using conventional microplates, with thymol and carvacrol at concentrations of 25 and 50 µM consistently enhancing velocity and total traveled distance following treatments from the egg stage to 10 days of adulthood (Extended Data Fig. 6b–e).

Lastly, we asked whether the improved motility outcomes were also reflected in preserved anatomical structures. To this end, we used a strain that expresses MYO-3 tagged with GFP in body wall muscles and quantified the damage to myofibrils, which consist of the contractile proteins required for efficient movement. During aging, myofibers exhibit severe damage and decreased MYO-3 expression48. Thymol and carvacrol treatments preserved myofiber structure at 25 and 50 µM, while higher doses did not reduce damage (Fig. 6m and Extended Data Fig. 6f), suggesting that higher doses may lack benefits under chronic exposure. Moreover, both thymol and carvacrol increased the MYO-3::GFP fluorescence intensity at all tested doses, indicating healthier myofibrils (Extended Data Fig. 6g–i). We did not observe an effect on overall lifespan, potentially due to antagonistic effects under chronic exposure, among other reasons (Extended Data Fig. 6j,k).

In summary, thymol improves age-related motility and slows skeletal muscle decline by enhancing cellular resilience to aging and stress through the activation of autophagy and mitophagy.

The effects of thymol on autophagy across species and tissue types suggest broad benefits that collectively support healthy aging. To this end, we aimed to translate these findings to a mammalian model of progressive aging by studying SAMP8 (senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8) mice. This model is particularly suited for studying the aging of the brain and physical performance, two domains that have a major role in age-related disabilities in humans. SAMP8 mice are an inbred strain selected from a genetically heterogeneous population of mice. Specifically, these mice naturally develop early signs of aging, such as reduced locomotor performance, sarcopenia, and cognitive decline linked to an accumulation of protein aggregates and a loss of mitochondrial respiratory function. Therefore, they are considered a relevant model for human aging49,50. We administered thymol at a dose of 20 mg kg−1 per day or vehicle by oral gavage for 5 days per week over 12 weeks starting at 8 months of age (Fig. 7a). First, we analyzed DNA methylation patterns that predict age-adjusted health status. These methylation-based epigenetic clocks are emerging as relevant biomarkers of aging in mammals and are used to detect the beneficial effects of interventions designed to extend healthspan51. Notably, the skeletal muscle tissue of mice supplemented with thymol showed a reduction in epigenetic age, as assessed using a pan-tissue epigenetic clock52, of approximately 20% compared to the control group (Student's t test, P = 0.033) (Fig. 7b).

Similar to findings in mice fed a HFD, thymol treatment did not affect body weight (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Histological analysis of the tibialis anterior muscle showed larger myofibers in mice treated with thymol compared to controls (Fig. 7c). The frequency distribution of the muscle fiber area further showed a shift toward larger myofibers compared to untreated mice (Fig. 7d), resulting in an approximately 13% increase in the cross-sectional fiber area (Student's t test, P < 0.001) (Fig. 7e). Endurance was strikingly higher in the thymol-treated group than in the control group (Fig. 7f). Notably, average performance increased twofold from baseline in treated mice, whereas it remained stable in the controls, suggesting an improvement in performance induced by thymol, even in a life stage characterized by a decline in mobility (Fig. 7g). Grip strength was preserved throughout the study in the treatment group, showing a robust preventive effect against the decline of muscle strength compared to control animals (Fig. 7h). Numerically, strength decreased by 36% from baseline in the vehicle-treated controls but remained stable from baseline in the thymol-treated group (Fig. 7i). The weights of the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles did not show differences between the groups (Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). Furthermore, motor coordination and working memory capacity, measured by the rotarod test and the continuous Y maze task, improved in the group of mice treated with thymol (Extended Data Fig. 7d,e). Despite the remarkable phenotypic improvements, the levels of mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins and protein markers of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response remained unchanged, suggesting a relatively selective effect on mitophagy independent of major changes in the total mitochondrial mass (Extended Data Fig. 7f). Gene expression changes were moderate, with only one gene set related to anti-inflammatory responses showing significant enrichment (Fig. 7j and Supplementary Table 6). Of note, the gene set—hallmark TNF signaling via NF-κB—was similar to that found in MAFs in response to thymol treatment (Extended Data Fig. 7g). Western blot analysis of gastrocnemius tissue biopsies showed an increased amount of PINK-1 protein, indicating robust activation of mitophagy through canonical PINK-1 signaling (Fig. 7k,l).

Together, these data indicate that thymol treatment delays the age-related decline in muscle performance and lowers epigenetic age in SAMP8 mice.

Autophagy has emerged as a principal mechanism that maintains cellular functions during aging53. Here, we describe thymol and carvacrol, two isomeric phenolic monoterpenes derived from thyme and oregano, as inducers of autophagy and mitophagy both in vitro and in vivo, with conserved effects across species. Thymol and carvacrol are hydrophobic molecules with bactericidal properties due to their ability to intercalate into bacterial membranes, and they are thought to provide antipathogenic defenses33,34,35. Mitochondria evolved from ancestral proteobacteria through an endosymbiotic process, giving rise to the bioenergetic properties of aerobic eukaryotes54. Autophagy induction by thymol in our eukaryotic models is consistent with an effect on mitochondrial membranes that resembles bacterial membrane disruption. Molecules that intercalate into mitochondrial membranes, such as the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ, have been shown to depolarize mitochondria and trigger autophagy36. This depolarization stimulates the PINK-1-dependent recruitment of Parkin, which in turn mediates the elimination of mitochondria in lysosomes through mitophagy43. In support of this hypothesis, we show that thymol lowers oxygen consumption in live zebrafish and impairs oxygen flux in preparations of freshly isolated mitochondria from mouse hepatocytes. Mechanistically, the induction of mitophagy by thymol depends on PINK-1, while oligomycin—a chemical that inhibits proton flux across the mitochondrial membrane and thereby counteracts membrane depolarization—blunts thymol-induced mitophagy. These results provide robust evidence for a mitochondrial membrane-originating mechanism through which thymol activates autophagy by depolarizing mitochondria, thereby enhancing mitochondrial clearance both in vitro and in vivo.

Mild, transient mitochondrial perturbations activate cellular stress response mechanisms, including autophagy and mitophagy, leading to long-term benefits through a process known as mitohormesis55,56. Previous reports show that not all damaged mitochondria can be efficiently cleared by mitophagy unless a certain threshold of damage is crossed and autophagy is activated by independent mechanisms57,58. We propose that thymol has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile for achieving mitohormetic effects in vivo. Previous pharmacokinetic studies in animals and humans show that thymol has a rapid Tmax of 0.5 and 1.97 h, respectively, followed by relatively fast clearance, with a half-life of 10.2 h in humans32,59. This prompt clearance of circulating thymol suggests that cells are only transiently exposed to its effects. As a result, mitophagy is primarily activated in damaged mitochondria, while autophagy is not activated in healthy mitochondria with normal electrochemical coupling. Rapid absorption in the duodenum further suggests that oral intake leads to transient peaks in thymol and its conjugates, reaching levels sufficient to activate autophagy in tissues before they are cleared60. While the exact pharmacokinetic profile and pharmacodynamic mechanism of action of thymol on mitochondrial turnover remain to be established, its common use in traditional medicine supports its safety in humans61.

In metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease, autophagy is known to hydrolyze triacylglycerol from lipid droplets40. Mitophagy concomitantly increases the turnover of defective mitochondria, thereby facilitating fatty acid oxidation and efficient metabolic coupling, as well as protecting hepatocytes against aberrant liver fat accumulation62. Our findings show that chronic administration of thymol to mice fed a HFD resulted in a reduction in liver lipid deposition and lower levels of P62 protein. Thymol did not affect body weight, which aligns with the potential for caloric restriction mimetic effects independent of weight loss.

Next, we tested the ability of C. elegans to adapt to heat stress. Autophagy has been reported to promote thermotolerance due to its role in the removal of protein aggregates that form when cellular temperatures rise to toxic levels63. Thymol efficiently preserved activity in response to heat shock, suggesting that autophagy is the underlying protective mechanism. Finally, we showed that thymol-treated worms had increased motility with age, accompanied by a lower degree of myofiber damage, suggesting protection against the age-related decline in body wall muscle function and thereby preserving mobility. Based on these results, we turned to SAMP8 mice, which are characterized by the occurrence of protein aggregates in the brain and skeletal muscle, among other tissues50. Thymol demonstrated a remarkable restoration of motor performance, including improvements in strength and endurance. The functional benefits were accompanied by a lower epigenetic age determined using a pan-tissue clock readout, suggesting a potent antiaging effect at the tissue level and its relevance for translation. A limitation of our study is the use of male mice across the different in vivo experiments, a choice made due to the availability constraints of aged animals. Although testing the efficacy of thymol and carvacrol in females is an important next step, the consistent effects observed in zebrafish larvae (a stage before sex determination) and in the hermaphrodite C. elegans suggest a largely sex-independent mechanism.

While deploying different species and experimental models is a strength of this work, the approach of using zebrafish larvae has some limitations. Our discovery paradigm is likely to miss compounds that depend on signaling pathways not yet established during early larval stages, as well as those specific to old age. Other limitations include the difficulty in deciding doses for oral efficacy in preclinical models, a problem that we mitigated by relying on the known pharmacokinetics of thymol in humans and rodents.

Terpenoids and polyphenolic compounds are secondary plant metabolites enriched in diets characterized by a high contribution of fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices64. Some of these noncaloric phytonutrients are proposed to stimulate autophagy and mitophagy, potentially forming part of the overall health impact of these diets through the cumulative effects of bioactive mixtures65. Analyses of dietary habits among people living in areas with a high percentage of centenarians indicate that individuals with extraordinary healthspans consume diets rich in mitohormetic phytochemicals66. The limited knowledge of the overall intake doses of thymol from aromatic plants makes it challenging to perform a systematic analysis of its contribution to long-term benefits through diet. Nonetheless, carvacrol- and thymol-containing plants have been used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and bactericidal properties, although their mechanism of action has remained largely elusive67,68.

Secondary plant metabolites have numerous biological functions, including symbiotic advantages such as producing colors and flavors, conferring resistance to stressors (such as drought, heat and radiation) and possessing antipathogenic properties, among other functions that may explain their bioactivity in humans. In fact, a surprising number of plant bioactives have inhibitory or modulatory effects on cellular bioenergetic functions in eukaryotic cells. For example, biguanides from the French lilac (Galega officinalis) inhibit mitochondrial respiratory complex I69,70 and have served as the lead structures for the antidiabetic medication metformin. Resveratrol and related flavonoid polyphenols from grapes and berries have been shown to bind to and inhibit F1-ATPase, slowing ATP synthesis71. Here, we demonstrate that thymol activates autophagy and mitophagy through a mechanism initiated at the level of mitochondrial bioenergetics, which may be related to the bactericidal properties of thymol as part of its original function in pathogen defense. Thus, the activation of cellular stress pathways by thymol, and potentially other secondary plant metabolites that target bacterial membranes, may reflect moonlighting functions in mitochondrial bioenergetics, autophagy and mitophagy when ingested and absorbed into mammalian cells.

Beyond the induction of autophagy and mitophagy at the mitochondrial level, pleiotropic effects likely exist. For example, thymol's effects on bacteria could influence the gut microbiome, which mediates positive health outcomes from fasting and metformin treatment72,73. While our cellular experiments demonstrate a cell-autonomous effect on autophagy and mitophagy, the microbial activity of thymol may influence the composition of the host microbiome. Interestingly, oregano essential oil is used in animal feed to lower intestinal inflammation and improve immunity by modulating the composition of intestinal microbiota74,75. Transcriptional profiling in MAFs and within a systemic context in skeletal muscle biopsies from SAMP8 mice showed an enrichment of gene signatures compatible with a reduced inflammatory response. Additional studies are warranted to assess the effect of thymol on microbiota, particularly as thymol is believed to be readily absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract and may not reach the distal small intestine76.

In summary, this study broadens the mechanistic understanding of the health benefits mediated by oregano and thyme terpenoids and shows a potential link between their functions as secondary metabolites in plants and their effects on mitochondrial bioenergetics, autophagy and mitophagy in eukaryotic cells. Thymol is present at high concentrations in common oregano and thyme species and can be enriched in oregano essential oils, making it a relatively simple and cost-effective ingredient for nutrition-based prevention. A range of medical conditions are additional avenues to explore, including neurodegenerative diseases characterized by proteotoxicity, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, as well as the spectrum of inherited mitochondrial diseases.

Mice were housed under standard conditions with ad libitum access to food and water. C57BL/6 wild-type mice were purchased from Janvier Labs and were fed either a standard diet (D12450J, Research Diets) or a HFD (D12492, Research Diets). Mito-QC mice were kindly provided by I. Ganley, and SAMP8 AKR/J mice were obtained from Envigo. Thymol was dissolved in corn oil and administered orally. The dose was selected using allometric scaling based on previous pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in mice and humans32,67. For the acute studies, 10-week-old male mito-QC or wild-type mice on a C57BL/6 background received thymol at a dose of 20 mg per kg body weight, followed by a second dose 14 h later. Two hours after the second dose, the mice were killed. Organs from mito-QC mice were postfixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde and 200 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) at 4 °C for 24 h. Tissues were then cryopreserved in 30% sucrose/PBS at 4 °C for 2 days, frozen in chilled isopentane on dry ice and cryosectioned at 8 µm. For chronic treatments, 10-week-old C57BL/6 or 8-month-old SAMP8 male mice received thymol at a dose of 20 mg per kg body weight per day or vehicle (corn oil). The mice were killed at the end of the treatments, and tissues were collected for analysis.

The following C. elegans strains were used in this study: wild-type N2, DA2123 (adIs2122[lgg-1p::GFP::lgg-1+rol-6(su1006)]), CF1038 (daf-16(mu86)), RB2547 (pink-1(ok3538)), TG38 (aak-2(gt33)), QV225 (skn-1(zj15)), RW1596 (stEx30[pmyo-3GFP::MYO-3 + rol-6(su1006)]) and IR2539 (unc-119(ed3); Ex[pmyo‐3TOMM‐20::Rosella; unc‐119(+)]). All strains were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (funded by the National Institutes of Health Office of Research Infrastructure Programs P40 OD010440), except for the strain expressing the mtRosella biosensor, which was a kind gift from the Tavernarakis laboratory in Greece. For RNAi experiments, Escherichia coli HT115 bacteria were transformed with either the pink-1 (RNAi) construct or the empty PL4440 vector. Bacteria were grown overnight in liquid cultures containing ampicillin and tetracycline, followed by subculturing in liquid medium with ampicillin. Cultures were mixed with IPTG (2 mM), seeded onto plates and dried overnight. The next day, the animals were placed on the plates. HT115 bacteria expressing pink-1 (RNAi) were obtained from the Ahringer RNAi library (ID II-4K04).

Human lymphocytic T Jurkat cells (clone E6.1, ATCC, TIB-152) were used to measure autophagic flux in vitro. Cells were grown in complete RPMI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11875093) under standard conditions. For the experiment, cells were washed, counted and incubated at 1 × 105 cells per well in RPMI plus 10% human AB serum (GemCell, GeminiBio, 100-512) in duplicate in a 96-well plate with either rapamycin (Sigma-Aldrich, C2920), thymol (Sigma-Aldrich, 16254), carvacrol (Sigma-Aldrich, W224502), FCCP (Sigma-Aldrich, C2920), or 0.5% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, D8418) as the vehicle.

Primary MAFs were obtained from C57BL/6J or mito-QC mice. Biopsy tissues were cut into small pieces with a scalpel blade and distributed on coated dishes with 1.5 ml DMEM high glucose (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10569010) supplemented with 20% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 100-18B). Thymol (100 μM), carvacrol (100 µM), valinomycin (1 µM) (Sigma-Aldrich, V0627) and oligomycin (1 nM) (Sigma-Aldrich, O4876) were each dissolved in DMSO, added to the cell medium, and left for 24 h.

Three transgenic embryos per well were placed in 96-well plates and treated with compounds diluted in DMSO. After 16 h, the embryos were anesthetized with 0.016% tricaine (Sigma-Aldrich, E10521) and imaged using the ImageXpress Micro Confocal High-Content Imaging System (Molecular Devices). Tricaine was then washed out, and the embryos were treated with 100 mM NH4Cl (Sigma-Aldrich, 09718) for 4 h before being imaged again. For automated imaging, larval images were initially acquired using a 4× objective and analyzed with MetaXpress software (version 6.7.2). A custom Python code has been developed for the automated detection of larvae. The script records the coordinates of an area of the body at a fixed distance from the edges of the tail and the head. Twenty-six Z stacks of each area are acquired using a 20× objective. For the identification and quantification of ZsGreen-LC3 puncta, two-dimensional projections were analyzed. Images were processed as follows: individual Z stacks were projected onto single images using maximal projection. The projection was subsequently smoothed using serial operations, and this smoothed image was then subtracted from the maximal projection to remove the fish background from the puncta signal, resulting in a subtracted image. The smoothed image was then binarized to create the pre-fish body mask, which was cleaned using area filtering. The final object was then shrunk to represent the fish body mask. The mean intensity of the smoothed image covered by the fish body was measured and used to binarize the subtracted image and create the pre-LC3 punctate mask. Finally, an LC3 puncta mask was created by keeping the pre-puncta objects encompassed within the fish body mask. Morphological measurements were recorded from the two final masks. The LC3 punctate total area relative to body surface area was used as a parameter for quantification. Python and MetaXpress codes have been deposited on GitHub and are accessible at https://github.com/giulializzo/zebrafish_high_content_imaging.git.

The OCR in zebrafish larvae was measured using the Seahorse XF24 instrument (Seahorse Bioscience). Larvae were placed in a 24-well islet microplate (XF24 Islet Capture FluxPak no. 101174-100, Seahorse Bioscience), maintained with an islet capture screen and overlaid with 600 µl of egg water without air bubbles. Larvae were allowed to equilibrate for 10 min and maintained at 28.5 °C throughout the entire experiment. Respiration rates were determined every 5 min. Basal respiration was calculated as the average of the last three measurement points (from 40 to 52 min) before the injection of FCCP to a final concentration of 0.8 µM. Uncoupled respiration was determined by the maximum value observed after FCCP injection. Larvae that did not respond to FCCP and exhibited OCR values lower than basal respiration were excluded from the analysis. Rotenone (Sigma-Aldrich, R8875) and antimycin A (Sigma-Aldrich, A8764) were injected at concentrations of 1 µM and 1 µg l−1, respectively, to inhibit the electron transport chain, with residual OCR accounting for nonmitochondrial respiration.

Total proteins were extracted from mouse tissues or from pools of 20 zebrafish larvae at 3 dpf, as described in the Supplementary Methods. For SDS–PAGE, lysates were diluted, mixed with NuPAGE LDS sample buffer and a sample reducing agent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NP0008 and NP0009), and heated at 70 °C for 10 min in heating blocks. Proteins (40 µg) were loaded onto precast NuPAGE Bis–Tris 1.0 mm Midi Protein Gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific, WG1402 and WBT01020), and electrophoresis was performed for 90 min at 130 V. Gels were incubated in 20% ethanol for 10 min and transferred onto PVDF membranes using the iBlot2 instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Membranes were rehydrated in TBS–Tween (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 28360) and blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS–Tween for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were incubated at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-AMPKα (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, 2532), rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-AMPKα (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, 2535), mouse monoclonal anti-CHOP (1:1,000, Abcam, Ab11419), rabbit polyclonal anti-CLPP (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, 14181), rabbit monoclonal anti-GAPDH (1:5,000, Abcam, Ab181602), mouse monoclonal anti-HSC70 (1:10,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-7298), rabbit polyclonal anti-HSP60 (1:1,000, Abcam, Ab46798), rabbit polyclonal anti-LC3 (1:1,000, Novus Biologicals, NB100-2220), rabbit monoclonal anti-Parkin (1:1,000, Abcam, Ab77924), rabbit polyclonal anti-PINK-1 (1:1,000, Novus Biologicals, BC100-494), mouse monoclonal anti-S6 ribosomal protein (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, 2317), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-S6 (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, 2211), mouse monoclonal anti-SQSTM1/P62 (1:1,000, Abnova, H00008878-M01), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ubiquitin (S65) (1:1,000, Boston Biochem, A110), rabbit polyclonal anti-VDAC-1 (1:1,000, Abcam, Ab15895), rabbit monoclonal anti-vinculin (1:5,000, Abcam, Ab219649) and total OXPHOS Blue Native WB Antibody Cocktail (1:1,000, Abcam, Ab110412). Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG H&L (HRP) secondary antibodies (1:10,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 31460 and 31430) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 32106).

To measure autophagy in Jurkat cells, we used the Guava LC3 antibody-based assay kit (Luminex, FCCH100171), following the manufacturer's instructions. The kit includes reagent A (an inhibitor of lysosomal activity), reagent B (a permeabilization solution) and an anti-LC3 antibody conjugated with FITC (clone 4E-12). Half of the replicates were incubated with reagent A for 30 min before the end of the treatment to block lysosomal degradation of LC3 vesicles, thereby measuring autophagic flux. Cells were then transferred to a 96-well V-bottom plate, permeabilized with reagent B to remove the cytoplasmic form of LC3 (LC3-I) and incubated with the FITC-conjugated LC3 antibody. Samples were then analyzed using a Becton Dickinson LSR Fortessa SORP analyzer. Offline analyses were performed using FCS Express Software (De Novo Software), with results expressed as the median fluorescence intensity in the FITC channel.

MMP and mitochondrial superoxide measurements in Jurkat cells were conducted using flow cytometry. For the MMP, JC-10 was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Enzo Life Sciences, ENZ-52305). Cells were treated with thymol, carvacrol or FCCP for 30 min, and JC-10 staining was added 15 min before analysis. For mitochondrial superoxide measurements, Jurkat cells were incubated with MitoSOX Red (5 µM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, M36008) for 20 min before acquisition. Samples were analyzed using a Becton Dickinson LSR Fortessa SORP flow cytometry analyzer. Offline analyses were performed using FCS Express Software (De Novo Software). The gating strategy is described in the Supplementary Methods.

In MAFs, the MMP was assessed by TMRM and MitoTracker costaining. Thymol or carvacrol (100 μM) was added to the medium and left for 24 h. Untreated cells received an equal volume of DMSO. Oligomycin (1 nM) was used to prevent proton efflux and depolarization. For MMP measurement, cells were grown in a 24-well glass-bottom plate in the presence of conditioned medium for 24 h, then costained with TMRM (20 nM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, T668) and MitoTracker Deep Red (100 nM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, M22426). Following a 30-min incubation in the dark at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with dye-free conditioned medium. TMRM and MitoTracker signals were analyzed using a TCS SP8 confocal microscope (Leica Biosystems), as described in the Supplementary Methods.

After dissection, liver tissue was rapidly cut into small pieces with scissors and placed in ice-cold medium A (0.32 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris–HCl, 1 mM EDTA; pH adjusted to 7.4). The pieces were transferred into a 5-ml Dounce homogenizer (glass–Teflon) at a ratio of 5 ml of medium A per 1 g of tissue. After four to six strokes at 600 rpm on ice, the suspension was transferred into a 15-ml Falcon tube and centrifuged at 1,000g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred into 2-ml microtubes and centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet containing mitochondria was resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold medium A. The mitochondrial protein concentration was then determined using the BCA method (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23225).

The OCR in mitochondria isolated from mouse livers was measured using high-resolution respirometry (OROBOROS Oxygraph-2k, Oroboros Instruments). For respirometry analysis, 150 µg of crude mitochondrial extract was added to modified MiR05 buffer (110 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl2, 20 mM taurine, 10 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM HEPES and 0.1% BSA essentially fatty acid free) in a 2-ml chamber at 37 °C. Respiration in isolated mitochondria was determined using SUIT (substrate–uncoupler–inhibitor titration) protocols, with modifications. Pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich, P2256, 5 mM), glutamate (Sigma-Aldrich, G1626, 10 mM) and malate (Sigma-Aldrich, M1000, 2 mM) were used as substrates for inducing complex I respiration in the presence of ADP (Sigma-Aldrich, A5285, 1 mM). A 2-µl volume of thymol solution (50 mM thymol in ethanol) was repeatedly injected to reach incremental concentrations of thymol in the respirometry chamber. The second (control) chamber was injected with the same volume of carrier (ethanol) alone. After a sufficient number of titration steps, respiration was halted by the addition of the complex I inhibitor rotenone (Sigma-Aldrich, R8875, 0.5 µM). Values obtained were normalized to the baseline respiration measured in the control chamber.

Total RNA was extracted as described in the Supplementary Methods. Total RNA (75 ng; 8.9 < RNA quality number < 10) was used to generate the libraries using the QuantSeq 3′ mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit FWD for Illumina (Lexogen, 015.384) following 20 cycles of PCR amplification. Libraries were quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen kit (Invitrogen, Q33140) on a FilterMax F3. The size pattern was assessed using the Fragment Analyzer 96 system with the High Sensitivity NGS Fragment Analysis Kit (Agilent Technologies, DNF-474-0500). Libraries were pooled at an equimolar ratio at a concentration of 40 nM, and sequencing was performed by loading a concentration of 650 pM with a P3 50 kit for 65 cycles on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 platform (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Body composition was measured using nuclear magnetic resonance with the Minispec device (Bruker). Lean body mass and body fat were recorded and normalized to total body weight. OGTT was performed on mice that had been fasted for 6 h. Tail vein glucose levels were measured using a Contour glucometer (Ascensia Diabetes Care) immediately before glucose administration and at 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after glucose administration (1 g glucose per kg body weight). Plasma insulin levels before glucose administration and at 15, 30 and 60 min after glucose administration during the OGTT procedure were quantified from heparinized plasma samples using an ultrasensitive ELISA kit (Crystal Chem, 90080).

The Triglyceride-Glo Assay kit (Promega, J3160) was used to measure triglyceride levels in mouse liver homogenates. Homogenates were prepared from 40 mg of liver tissue in 1 ml ice-cold PBS, using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen) at a frequency of 30 oscillations per second for 2 min. The homogenates were subsequently centrifuged at 1,000g at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was used for the triglyceride assay according to the manufacturer's instructions.

For experiments on plates, C. elegans strains were cultured at 20 °C on nematode growth medium (NGM) agar plates seeded with the E. coli strain OP50. Thymol and carvacrol were mixed into the agar medium before the plates were poured. DMSO was used as a control (maximum concentration of 0.4% for 100 µM). Fresh plates were prepared weekly, and animals were transferred to freshly seeded plates daily after reaching the L4 stage.

For pharmacological treatment on chips, worms were exposed to carvacrol, thymol or 1% DMSO in liquid NGM medium with heat-killed E. coli OP50 (20 mg ml−1). Compounds were dissolved in DMSO and prepared at a 2× concentration in liquid NGM. On the day of treatment, the 2× stock was diluted to the final concentration with liquid NGM containing heat-killed E. coli OP50. Once the animals reached the L4 stage, they were loaded into microfluidic chips (Infinity Chips, NemaLife) and maintained on a diet of heat-killed E. coli OP50 for 24 h. On day 1 of adulthood, worms were treated with the appropriate compound or 1% DMSO. Medium exchange was performed daily to maintain consistent exposure until the end of the assays.

The number of autophagosomes was assessed in the DA2123 C. elegans strain that expresses GFP::LGG-1, with autophagosomes detected as GFP+ puncta. Animals were collected, washed to remove bacteria and anesthetized using metamizole at a final concentration of 20 mM. The animals were then placed on slides and observed under the 40× lens of a Leica DM5500 upright microscope. Mitophagy was measured using a strain that expresses the mtRosella biosensor in the mitochondria of body wall muscle cells. Mitophagy was calculated as the ratio of pH-insensitive DsRed to pH-sensitive GFP, as previously described77.

For the healthspan assay, one 90-s video per chip was recorded for each time point. The activity score analysis involved determining the fraction of pixels (representing a worm within a bounding box) that changed over 30 s. Highly active animals that completely moved their bodies out of the bounding box were assigned a score of 1, whereas completely inactive animals received a score of 0. Animals with intermediate scores still had a portion of their bodies remaining in the bounding box after 30 s. For thermotolerance assays, L4 animals and C. elegans carrying deletions of daf-16, pink-1, aak-2 and skin-1 were loaded into microfluidic chips at 20 °C with NGM. On day 1 of adulthood, the medium was exchanged with NGM containing the appropriate treatment, and the animals were allowed to grow until day 3 of adulthood. Subsequently, the animals were exposed to a 37 °C heat shock for 4 h, followed by recovery and scoring for the number of alive animals in the chips.

The mean speed and distance crawled by C. elegans on the plate were measured on day 10 of adulthood using the Movement Tracker software, as previously described78. Lifespan tests were performed at 20 °C, and the worms were monitored daily for survival. Worms were considered to have died if they failed to respond to gentle prodding with a platinum wire. Lifespan data were recorded until all the worms had died. Lifespan metrics were calculated and analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method.

RW1596 animals were grown on NGM plates seeded with E. coli OP50 bacteria and containing either thymol, carvacrol or vehicle. The animals were maintained on these plates until day 10 of adulthood, after which they were collected, washed to remove bacteria and anesthetized with tetramisole at a final concentration of 20 mM. They were then placed on slides and observed under the 40× lens of a Leica DM5500 upright microscope.

At least 200 muscle cells were counted for each condition. Muscle cells containing broken myofibrils or myofibrils with abnormal orientation were classified as damaged, while those with intact myofibrils showing normal, parallel orientation were classified as normal. Finally, the percentage of damaged myofibers relative to the total number of myofibers was calculated.

DNA extraction was performed on 100 mg of muscle tissue using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit, following the manufacturer's recommendations. DNA was quantified using DropSense technology (Unchained Labs). Bisulfite conversion was performed on 500 ng of DNA using the Zymo EZ DNA methylation kit, following the manufacturer's instructions. Converted DNA (200 ng) was used to proceed with the Infinium HD Methylation Assay Protocol, following the manufacturer's recommendations. DNA methylation data were generated using custom arrays (HorvathMammalMethyl40, Illumina) and scanned on an iScan reader (Illumina). Biological age was quantified based on a pan-tissue epigenetic clock algorithm52.

Endurance was evaluated using a treadmill apparatus (Ugo Basile) with a gradually accelerating protocol, starting at 5 rpm for 2 min and increasing to 50 m s−1 over 2,700 s. The test was terminated by exhaustion, defined as ten falls per minute in the motivational air puff.

Weakness was assessed by measuring forelimb grip strength using a grip strength meter (Ugo Basile). Mice grasped the grid with their forelimbs and were gently pulled away by holding the base of their tails. Measurements were recorded in triplicate, and the average was used for the analysis.

The Y maze task was used to measure spontaneous alternation behavior. Mice were introduced to the center of the maze and allowed to explore the three arms for 6 min. The number of triads was recorded to calculate the percentage of alternation. An entry was defined when all four limbs were within an arm.

A rotarod apparatus (Ugo Basile) was used to assess coordination skills. After two acclimation sessions, the apparatus was set to a starting velocity of 4 rpm and an acceleration rate of 20 rpm per minute. Mice underwent three trial sessions at least 20 min apart, and the latency to fall was recorded for each mouse.

For histochemical analysis, tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen-precooled isopentane. The tibialis anterior muscle was cut into 12-μm sections at −25 °C, and the sections were thaw-mounted on slides. The slides were dried at room temperature and stained using a monoclonal anti-laminin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, L9393) diluted 1:100 and a goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor 405) secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A48254) diluted 1:500 for detection. Livers were cryodissected at 8 µm and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde. The ORO stock stain was prepared by dissolving 0.5 g of ORO (Sigma-Aldrich, O0625) in 100 ml of isopropanol. The working solution was prepared by diluting 30 ml of the stock with 20 ml of distilled water. Liver tissues were cut into 2-mm-thick slices, fixed in formalin, paraffinized and hydrated. After deparaffinization and rehydration with xylene and ethanol, the slides were stained with ORO working solution for 15 min, rinsed with 60% isopropanol and lightly stained with hematoxylin for 4 min. After rinsing with distilled water, the slides were mounted. Lipid droplets were stained red and assessed using an Olympus VS120 slide scanner. The size of lipid droplets per field was calculated based on the average size of lipid droplets in ten fields from each mouse liver slide, using the multipoint function of ImageJ.

Raw counts were mapped to the mouse reference genome (GRCm38-101) using STAR (v.2.5.3) and counted using HTSeq-count (v.0.6.1). Data were checked for quality, and no outliers were detected in the principal component analysis. A filter was applied to select only genes with a minimum of 30 reads in at least six samples (corresponding to a threshold of 3.809 on the count per million values), and nonannotated genes were discarded. A total of 10,697 features were retained using these filtering criteria. To account for composition bias between libraries, we applied TMM (trimmed mean of M-value) normalization79. Differential expression analysis between groups was performed using edgeR (v.4.2.1), which estimates gene-wise negative binomial dispersions by calculating the adjusted profile log-likelihood for each gene and maximizing it using the weighted likelihood empirical Bayes method80. A quasi-likelihood negative binomial generalized log-linear model was fitted to the count data, and a gene-wise empirical Bayes quasi-likelihood F test was conducted for each comparison. Resulting P values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg correction method.

Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the Camera function in the edgeR package81, which conducts a competitive test to assess whether the genes in the set are highly ranked in terms of differential expression relative to genes not in the set, while accounting for intergene correlation. Camera was applied to the hallmark pathways from the mouse MSigDB82. The Fry algorithm from edgeR was applied to assess the enrichment of a preselected list of pathways. Fry is a fast approximation of a rotation gene set test that performs self-contained gene set tests to assess whether any of the genes in the set are differentially expressed83. P values are obtained through simulation, followed by adjustment for multiple testing.

For each coverslip containing mito-QC fibroblasts or tissues, ten random images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope with a 63× oil immersion objective. Images were processed with ImageJ using a custom macro, as described in the Supplementary Methods.

GraphPad Prism software version 9.0 (GraphPad Software) was used to perform all statistical analyses as indicated in the main text and figure legends, except for the gene expression and pathway analyses. Bar graphs show means ± s.e.m. Box plot elements show the following data: median (center line), upper and lower quartiles (box limits), minimum and maximum values (whiskers), and points. Differences between two groups were assessed using Student's t test. Differences among more than two groups were assessed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The interaction between two factors was tested using a two-way ANOVA. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. Survival analysis in zebrafish and worms was performed using the Kaplan–Meier method, and pairwise comparisons were conducted using the log-rank test. For high-content imaging, zebrafish larvae that were displaced during acquisition, resulting in undetectable LC3-positive puncta, were excluded from the analysis. No randomization method was used in zebrafish, cell or worm experiments. Mice were randomized using simple randomization based on body weight within the experimental groups. All phenotyping experiments in mice were conducted with the experimenters blinded to the treatment, and data analyses were performed without knowledge of the experimental conditions. Chronic mouse interventions were performed once, but they followed blinding and randomization to ensure reproducibility. For mouse studies, animals that showed weight loss greater than 20%, those found dead in their cages, and those displaying signs of infection and inflammation in their wounds were killed and excluded from the study.

For the worm and zebrafish experiments, the researchers performing the assays were blinded to the treatment. Histopathology, confocal imaging and image analysis were performed in a blinded manner. For all other experiments, blinding was not formally conducted. For short-term thymol supplementation studies in mice, the sample size was determined based on previous publications to detect significant changes in mitophagy or autophagy induction, as measured by the mitophagy index or the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, respectively38,84. For the metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease model, the sample size was similar to that reported in other studies85. For the SAMP8 study, treadmill performance exhibited the greatest variability among all the parameters considered. Based on pilot studies, a 20% decline in motor performance was expected between 8 and 11 months of age. With a study power (β) set at 0.80, an α error of 0.05, and assumptions of a halt in motor decline from the start of treatment and a 25% mortality rate, a sample size of 15 animals per group was deemed necessary. SAMP8 mice that died before the end of the experiment were excluded from subsequent analyses. For C. elegans studies, sample sizes were determined based on previous publications42,86. For all representative images showing cells, zebrafish or C. elegans, experiments were repeated a minimum of three times independently and checked to ensure the reproducibility of the results. The graphics used in the schemata throughout the paper were created using BioRender.com.

When children are exposed to acetaminophen -- also known by the brand name Tylenol or as paracetamol -- during pregnancy, they may be more likely to develop neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including autism and ADHD, according to a new study.

The study was published recently in BMC Environmental Health. Andrea Baccarelli, dean of the faculty at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and professor of environmental health, was senior author. The study was led by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and also included co-authors from other institutions.

The researchers analyzed results from 46 previous studies worldwide that investigated the potential link between prenatal acetaminophen use and subsequent NDDs in children. The researchers used the Navigation Guide Systematic Review methodology -- a gold-standard framework for synthesizing and evaluating environmental health data -- which enabled them to conduct a rigorous, comprehensive analysis that supported evidence of an association between acetaminophen exposure during pregnancy and increased incidence of NDDs.

The researchers noted that while steps should be taken to limit acetaminophen use, the drug is important for treating pain and fever during pregnancy, which can also harm the developing fetus. High fever can raise the risk of neural tube defects and preterm birth. "We recommend judicious acetaminophen use -- lowest effective dose, shortest duration -- under medical guidance, tailored to individual risk-benefit assessments, rather than a broad limitation," they wrote.

In late September, the Food and Drug Administration announced it would issue a letter to clinicians urging them to be cautious about the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy. Baccarelli said he had discussed his study with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the weeks leading up to that announcement and provided the White House team with an statement noting his research found "evidence of an association" between prenatal exposure to acetaminophen and neurodevelopmental disorders. "That association is strongest when acetaminophen is taken for four weeks or longer," Baccarelli said.

The statement continued: "Further research is needed to confirm the association and determine causality, but based on existing evidence, I believe that caution about acetaminophen use during pregnancy -- especially heavy or prolonged use -- is warranted."

Baccarelli noted in the "competing interests" section of the research paper that he has served as an expert witness for plaintiffs in a case involving potential links between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders.

The study was conducted in collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles; University of Massachusetts Lowell; and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

Ever since Denis Villeneuve was announced as the director of the next James Bond movie, there's been rampant speculation over just who might be stepping into the shoes left behind in Daniel Craig's explosive departure. But a new report suggests that for all of Amazon's quick movement once it got control of the franchise, it might be a good while longer until the search for the next 007 gets underway.

A new report by Deadline today suggests that Villeneuve won't begin the hunt for his new Bond in earnest until next year, once production is completed on his third (and most likely final) Dune film, Dune: Part Three, which began filming this past June. Although principal photography for Part Two was around five months, an end date for Part Three remains unknown (and it's perhaps likely that Villeneuve will want to focus on elements of post-production into 2026 before shifting priorities to Bond).

Although Deadline's report says that the search for the next face of the franchise hasn't truly begun yet, that doesn't mean that there aren't at least some guidelines that Villeneuve and Amazon are honing their search on. According to the trade, the studio is looking for a British man, relatively unknown, in their late 20s or early 30s (so alas, put aside your Toms Hardy, your Idrises Elba, and perhaps even your Toms Holland—and absolutely your Pierces Brosnan, whatever he says) by the time the film begins shooting some time in 2027.

Also intriguing to note in the report is the idea that the new film may potentially focus on Bond's career in the Royal Navy, depicting his time as a commander before he's tapped by MI6 and eventually earns his 00-agent status. Although the direction of Stephen Knight's script is still in the air as it's being written, that potential focus is interestingly timed. After the conclusion of Craig's era as Bond, a full-on reboot that envisions the character's rise to the elite wings of British spycraft makes sense, but it will also mean it comes fascinatingly timed with next year's 007 First Light.

A lot of the big draw of IO Interactive's splashy new video game take on Bond is that it will similarly chart the story of a young Bond—the youngest we've seen so far at 26, depending on the eventual age of Villeneuve and Amazon's pick—as he joins MI6 and rises through the ranks to 00-status. Obviously a video game and a new movie (that may not be out for a couple years after First Light‘s release) are very different things, but it'd be interesting to see if this new era of Bond starts out with two major projects that explore the early days of the legendary spy.

Either way, with the hunt for the next big screen Bond not happening quite so soon, and First Light not out until March 2026, it's going to be a while until we really see what's next for James.

If you missed IShowSpeed in Seattle, you're too slow.

The YouTube sensation live-streamed his way through the city on Tuesday, eating, posing with fans, playing tourist at Pike Place Market and much more.

With more than 44 million subscribers on YouTube and another 40 million followers on Instagram, the online personality has become a global sensation. He was recently named Rolling Stone's most influential creator, and Forbes profiled his meteoric rise last year.

Born Darren Jason Watkins Jr., the 20-year-old originally from Cincinnati streams his antics all over the world, and is currently on a 35-day, 25-state “Speed Does America Tour.”

His continuous stream from Seattle (below) featured a frenzied insider's view of Speed being mobbed at every stop by fans — mostly young guys — shouting his name and trying to get his attention for selfies. An entourage of camera operators and beefy security guards formed a buffer around his every move, instructing people to “make room!” and “back up!”

“How do you spell Seattle?” he shouted into his phone while posting a picture of himself posing in front of the famed Public Market neon. In the background, an Amazon driver perched in his delivery van could be seen trying to grab his own pic.

Speed caught and tossed a fish, of course, and made his way through the Market for a view of Puget Sound, and then on to the Post Alley Gum Wall.

“This is real?” he wondered as people shouted “don't touch it!” Speed was handed a piece of gum to chew and when he leaped to place it high on the wall above the sticky mess below, a crowd in the alley erupted in cheers.

Throughout the journey, Speed constantly checked a smartphone strapped to his wrist, reacting now and then to comments or complaining about his stream lagging. The YouTube stream attracted 1.9 million views.

Elsewhere on his visit, IShowSpeed was seen in Pioneer Square, on the waterfront Great Wheel, in the Chinatown International District, in a glass blowing studio, and even paragliding.

And because no visit would be complete, his crew stopped for burgers, too.

“Let's try some Dick's!” Speed said.

The tour ended high above the city at the Space Needle, where Speed was given VIP access to the roof.

“Seattle's skyline has to be one of the best I've seen,” Speed said before doing a backflip 600 feet above the city. “This skyline is dope as hell.”

Oracle is reportedly looking to raise funds just weeks after the company inked an historic AI infrastructure deal with OpenAI.  

Cloud infrastructure giant Oracle is looking to raise $15 billion through corporate bond sales, according to reporting from Bloomberg, citing sources. The sale could include up to seven different parts, with the potential for one said part to be an uncommon 40-year bond, Bloomberg reported.  

TechCrunch reached out to Oracle for more information.  

This report comes just a few weeks after Oracle reportedly signed a sizable deal with OpenAI to supply the AI research lab with $300 billion worth of compute. Questions of how either side was going to pay for such a deal shortly came after.  

The company is also reportedly in talks with Meta about a $20 billion compute deal as well.  

Oracle announced Monday that Safra Catz was transitioning from the company's CEO to instead serve as the executive vice chair of Oracle's board of directors after 11 years at the helm. Catz will be replaced by co-CEOs Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia.

Will the new $100,000 H-1B visa fee in the U.S. drive tech companies to look to Canada for a cheaper way to employ AI talent — and encourage more Canadians to stay home?

With President Donald Trump's executive order shaking up the visa system that many U.S. tech companies use to hire skilled immigrant workers, Canadian officials are seizing the opportunity to pitch their country as a more welcoming and affordable alternative.

In British Columbia, where both Microsoft and Amazon already have a large presence, Minister of Jobs and Economic Growth Ravi Kahlon jumped into the fray with a LinkedIn post referencing the H-1B changes, stressing the province's commitment to science and innovation. 

“We're inviting tech talent, innovators, and scientists to come to B.C. and be part of building the economic engine of Canada's new economy!” he wrote, adding a maple leaf emoji for emphasis.

Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York on Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney suggested that the changes could see fewer Canadians leaving to work for U.S. tech companies. While Canadian universities graduate many talented students with expertise in AI and quantum computing, he noted, most end up working in Silicon Valley and Seattle.

“I understand you're changing your visa policy,” Carney told the U.S. audience, with a smile. “So we are going to hang on to a few of those.”

The idea isn't just about keeping Canadian graduates at home. With the new $100,000 H-1B fee raising the cost of hiring foreign workers in the U.S., tech companies may find it cheaper to bring overseas talent to Canadian hubs like Vancouver or Toronto instead.

But while Canadian leaders see an opening, immigration experts caution that the impact may be narrower than it first appeared. In an alert for employers, lawyers Megan Vogel and Diane Butler at Davis Wright Tremaine LLP in the Seattle area noted that the $100,000 fee applies only to new H-1B petitions, and that the cost will fall on employers — not workers.

At the same time, for Canadians wanting to work in the United States, the H-1B is not the only option. They can apply for a USMCA Professional (TN visa), which offers many of the benefits of the H-1B. It does not, however, provide a path to permanent residence. 

For non-Canadian and non-US citizens who have been working for an American company in Canada for a year or more, there is also the option of an L-1A or L-2A visa. These allow for “internal transfers” of employees between the two countries under certain conditions.

While the new H-1B costs could heighten competition between Canada and the United States for tech talent, Washington state and British Columbia are still on a path to collaborate closely on a long-held regional vision: the Cascadia Innovation Corridor. 

The initiative, which also includes Oregon, is supported by Microsoft President Brad Smith and led by former Washington state governor Chris Gregoire. Both Smith and Gregoire will be speaking at the organization's annual conference in Seattle next month.

The group is promising an update on its vision for a high-speed rail link through the region. The Cascadia high-speed rail initiative received $54.5 million in federal and state funding in late 2024 to plan future rail service connecting Seattle with Portland and Vancouver.

It is not clear what impact the Trump administration's budget priorities may have on future funding for the high-speed rail link. But there's clearly strong interest on both sides of the border in improving transportation between the two countries — even if the new visa fees mean fewer tech workers might be making the trip in the short run.

A secure boot a day keeps a virus away.

Ever since the release of Windows 11, if you're a PC gamer, you've definitely heard the term "Secure Boot." It's required to play a myriad of different games these days — mainly competitive shooters — and serves as one part of the two-punch security knockout consisting of TPM and Secure Boot. These features help keep your system protected from bad actors, and now Valve has just made it super convenient to check whether you're ahead of the curve. In the latest Steam beta, you can easily see your Secure Boot status in the settings.

If you open Steam and go to "Help" in the menu bar and click on "System Information," you'll be bombarded with a bunch of stats about your PC. Just scroll down till you see the "Operating System" heading, and you should see a list item for Secure Boot, telling you if it's enabled. This makes it easier for gamers who get inundated with information to ensure they're not excluded. While you're there, you'll see your TPM status as well, which is the other big security feature of Windows 11 and a requirement for (official) compatibility with the OS.

 




TPM stands for Trusted Platform Module, and it's a little hardware block that's cordoned off from the rest of the system because it houses ultra-sensitive cryptographic keys. It works hand-in-hand with Secure Boot to check if anything has changed since the last known good boot. It does that by recording hashes at each stage of every boot run to tally against, which is just one secret, along with many others (like BitLocker encryption keys) that are stored away in this chip. TPM is a requirement in most modern online games, just like Secure Boot.

Secure Boot works to ensure that only trusted, signed software runs when your PC starts, in an effort to sift out any shady programs. It's a kernel-level security feature, so it enjoys the highest level of privilege on your system — something that its critics often point toward as a vulnerability. Secure Boot, in essence, is a novel concept and is designed to do what it says: make your boot secure, but sometimes the amount of access it has can raise questions.

 




That's because most anti-cheat software is reliant on Secure Boot as it's essentially responsible for creating a safe space for the anti-cheat right as your system is starting, from where on out the anti-cheat can catch any exploits or malicious code itself. This can get really territorial, as recently seen with EA's Javelin in Battlefield 6. Without Secure Boot (and often TPM), some games won't even launch, so it's important to enable it if you see it turned off in Steam. To do so, you need to head over to your BIOS; check your motherboard manufacturer's guides for more info.

A high-profile settlement to resolve nationwide antitrust lawsuits last year upended traditional real estate commission structures. Now a new startup is looking to capitalize with a tech-driven platform that lets homebuyers submit purchase offers without using an agent. 

HomeBuyMe was founded in 2024 and launched its consumer service earlier this year in San Diego. The company is now expanding into the Seattle area this month.

The company's platform allows buyers to create a purchase offer step-by-step with help from AI. It integrates with Docusign for contracts, and ensures offers are reviewed by processors and independent attorneys.

“This is a huge disruption to the entrenched homebuying process,” said Tim Harader, a Seattle-area tech vet and CTO at HomeBuyMe. 

For decades, the U.S. residential real estate market operated on a model where the home seller paid the commission for both their listing agent and the buyer's agent — typically 5-to-6% of the home's selling price, split between the two agents. 

In March 2024, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) agreed to a $418 million settlement to resolve nationwide antitrust lawsuits. Plaintiffs claimed NAR rules forced sellers to pay inflated commissions by requiring offers of compensation to buyer's agents.

Harader said the ideal HomeBuyMe customer is someone who has identified a home they want and is ready to make an offer — but also avoid the lock-in that comes with a buyer-agent relationship.

“They want to have more control over the process but they still need guidance in creating the offer and in navigating the important steps that come after the seller accepts,” he said.

Buyers using pay $499 to $899 per offer, though it's free when making an offer on a partner builder's property.

HomeBuyMe started with a consumer offering and is now making a B2B push by partnering with homebuilders, including Blackwood Homes, a real estate developer in the Seattle region.

Harader said homebuilders can use savings from the buy-side commission to offer additional value to customers through upgrades or cash-back incentives. 

He said the company's biggest competition is the status quo.

“The residential real estate buying process hasn't changed in over 60 years,” he said. “Even with the new rules enacted in 2024 due to the NAR settlement, it will take some time for buyers and sellers to become aware of what they can do through HomeBuyMe and for us to earn their trust.”

HomeBuyMe's value could be strongest for buyers who already know the home they want. But many buyers still rely on agents to find properties, get access to showings, or understand the broader residential real estate process.

The startup has raised money from angel investors and employs 22 people.

Harader previously worked at Microsoft for more than 13 years across two stints. HomeBuyMe CEO Bill Goldberg and COO Frank Martin (another Microsoft vet) are also based in the Seattle area.

The drug interleukin-2 does a great job of goosing a patient's immune response to certain kidney and melanoma cancers. In fact, it can crank the immune system so high that it triggers life-threatening toxic conditions. 

But now researchers with the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design have used AI to engineer a protein that can quickly shut off interleukin-2, as just one example of the technology's potential applications. 

The scientists describe their work in a paper being published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature.  

“One way to control a medicine is through dose. We've added a second lever by designing molecules that can be switched off rapidly, even after they've taken full effect,” said David Baker, senior author of the study and a 2024 Nobel Laureate for his work in computational protein design.

The engineered protein works by inserting itself into a complex of proteins that are bound together, changing their shape and causing them to fall apart. In the example pursued by the UW scientists, the novel protein targets a complex that includes interleukin-2 that's tightly bound to an immune cell receptor, causing it to quickly release. 

With one of these engineered proteins, “you could much more precisely control the duration of [immune response] signaling and also immediately shut down any immune activation, even after it's already started,” said Adam Broerman, lead author of the Nature paper and a graduate student in Baker's lab. 

The interleukin-2 experiments were performed in human cells in the lab, demonstrating the strategy works. Going forward, the tool could be used to develop therapies for cancer and other diseases. It could also be used in studies that seek to understand and manipulate cellular processes by rapidly turning protein interactions off and on. 

In his research, Broerman tried a variety of engineered proteins, tweaking different components to optimize the impact. 

Earlier experiments showed modest improvements to the speed at which the proteins broke apart. When Broerman landed on the winning solution, the de novo protein worked so fast he had to recalibrate his measuring devices to clock the disassociation. 

“That was probably one of the most fun weeks of my life, when this first started working,” Broerman said.

The study was led by scientists at the Institute for Protein Design and included researchers from the UW's Department of Chemistry, Osnabrück University, Stanford University and Oregon Health & Science University. 

Additional authors of the article titled “Design of facilitated dissociation enables timing of cytokine signalling” include Christoph Pollmann, Yang Zhao, Mauriz A. Lichtenstein, Mark D. Jackson, Maxx H. Tessmer, Won Hee Ryu, Masato Ogishi, Mohamad H. Abedi, Danny D. Sahtoe, Aza Allen, Alex Kang, Joshmyn De La Cruz, Evans Brackenbrough, Banumathi Sankaran, Asim K. Bera, Daniel M. Zuckerman, Stefan Stoll, K. Christopher Garcia, Florian Praetorius and Jacob Piehler.

YouTube will allow creators whose accounts were terminated for repeated violations of COVID-19 and election integrity policies to rejoin the platform, according to a letter that YouTube parent company Alphabet sent to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) on Tuesday.

“Reflecting the Company's commitment to free expression, YouTube will provide an opportunity for all creators to rejoin the platform if the Company terminated their channels for repeated violations of COVID-19 and elections integrity policies that are no longer in effect,” Alphabet's legal counsel Daniel F. Donovan wrote. “YouTube values conservative voices on its platform and recognizes that these creators have extensive reach and play an important role in civic discourse.”

This letter was a response to a subpoena from Rep. Jordan, who sought to investigate if the Biden-Harris administration had “coerced or colluded” with companies like Alphabet to censor speech.

At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many social platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter enacted policies to ban the spread of medical misinformation about the virus and vaccines. For example, YouTube disallowed content saying that vaccines can cause cancer, a false claim which is not supported by scientific research.

Later, platforms also took action against content falsely claiming that the 2020 U.S. presidential election was “stolen” from Donald Trump. Twitter, not yet bought and rebranded by Elon Musk, said that it suspended 70,000 accounts for sharing QAnon conspiracy content and inciting violence in the week after the January 6 riots.

But leading up to the presidential election in 2024, online platforms began loosening their policies around misinformation. On YouTube, this included reinstating president Donald Trump, whose account had been banned after the January 6 attack for breaking rules around inciting violence. The platform also reinstated Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who became the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services.

Now, according to the company's letter to Rep. Jordan, all creators whose accounts were censored by these policies will be allowed back on the platform. 

“While the reliance on health authorities in this context was well-intentioned, the Company recognizes it should have never come at the expense of public debate on these important issues,” the company wrote.

YouTube did not respond to TechCrunch's request for comment.

It's taken more than 2.5 million years to get from the earliest sharpened-stone version of a knife to what Scott Heimendinger believes is a modern kitchen marvel.

A longtime inventor and culinary technologist, Heimendinger is the founder and CEO of Seattle Ultrasonics, and he's just released the startup's signature product — an ultrasonic, 8-inch chef's knife intended to make life easier for home cooks.

The C-200 is billed as the world's first such tool, and it builds off Heimendinger's 15 years of experience innovating around kitchen and food technology. He was previously director of applied research for Modernist Cuisine; CMO and chief innovation officer for Anova; and founder of Sansaire, a sous vide startup.

At $399, the ultrasonic knife eclipses the $170 versions listed atop Food & Wine's roundup of the best traditional chef's knives. And while Heimendinger's knife still features a great piece of sharp Japanese san mai AUS-10 steel, it's the handle that does the heavy lifting, with electronics that produce more than 40,000 vibrations per second, making the knife behave sharper than it physically is.

The only noticeable difference is a power button that a chef has to hold while cutting.

But Heimendinger is not just leaning on technology for kicks. He's critical of the smart kitchen revolution from several years ago that saw WiFi jammed into every other kitchen gadget.

“If it didn't make the tool work better, I would have abandoned the product, because it'd be dishonest,” Heimendinger said. 

And thanks to a robotic assistant, he has the data to back up his claim that the knife does indeed cut better. Heimendinger bought 21 of the most popular chef's knives and put them to the test with J Robot Choppenheimer, a robotic arm that repeated exact slicing motions across different foods mounted on 3D-printed holders resting on a very sensitive scale.

He collected 100,000 data points and studied things such as edge angle and retention for his “Quantified Knife Project.” The data and software he wrote for the project are open-sourced on GitHub.

“If I was gonna try to make a knife better, first I needed to understand, ‘better than what?'” he said, adding that as a former Microsoft program manager working on products such as Excel, the data is key.

Heimendinger ultimately found, thanks to perfecting the blade vibrations facilitated by the handle's piezoelectric crystals, that the ultrasonic knife requires less downward force to glide through a tomato or carrot or loaf of bread or any other food item.

It's been a five-year journey for Heimendinger, who raised $2 million in pre-seed funding to fuel his startup. 

The knife is now sold via the Seattle Ultrasonics website. It's the product of a global supply chain, with three-layer Japanese steel that is fabricated into blades in China before heading to Malaysia to be assembled with all of the electronics and packaging. 

Tariffs aren't helping, but Heimendinger subscribes to the Eames design philosophy to “make the best for the most for the least.” A sleek, wall-mounted charging tile sells for $150 and can currently be bundled with a knife for $499.

Heimendinger started with the chef's knife because it's a kitchen workhorse, but a full lineup of knives is planned, including a bread knife, santoku, vegetable cleaver, and others. A paring knife might be tough because the handle holding the electronics can't get much smaller.

“I think in the long term, the sonification of the kitchen could be a thing,” Heimendinger said. “I've got a long product roadmap of other ultrasonic stuff.”

He teased one such idea because a patent filing is already out there: ultrasonic ice cream scoop.

“Imagine just having less friction, being able to break up those ice crystals,” he said, before conceding “it's gonna take years to get through all of that, and there's a lot to do in knives before we even get there.”

Most of us use streaming services to watch just about everything at this point. Heck, even YouTube has a premium model for those of us who don't want to deal with adverts, so we're only getting more of them as time goes on. While TVs can be good for covering all of this stuff, those who want a smoother experience will often do well to go for a dedicated streaming device instead.

The Roku Streambar SE is a great streaming device that also doubles as a soundbar, making it a great pickup for a whole host of people. While it would normally cost you $100, it's currently down to $79 instead, making it a great time to upgrade your home entertainment system while this deal lasts.

See at Amazon

As a soundbar, this device has two front-facing speakers that help it push audio into a room and fill it with sound. It means that you'll be able to enjoy enhanced audio, but it also has a dedicated bass port to ensure amazing depth of sound. Plus, it has a mode that actually enhances the speech of anything you're watching specifically, which is great for people who feel like the chatter is always too quiet. It's us, we're the people who think that the chatter is always too quiet, we don't want to have to turn things up when people are talking, then immediately panic when an explosion happens.

Along with that, it's still a really good streaming device. That means that you can easily access all of your favorite streaming services in one place, and easily switch between them with less hassle. It supports 4K visuals as well, which means you're going to be getting some great-looking and great-sounding shows and films. It's also surprisingly easy to set up, which is great for those who are tech-averse, and the remote means you can handle the audio and the streaming side of things all at the same time with the same device. We've all lost one of the three controllers at one point or another, so this is a big win.

Given that this combines two devices into one, and they're both really helpful, you'd expect this to cost more than it does at the full price of $100. So, if you do want a nice boost to your entertainment system, being able to get it while it's down to $79 instead is a great opportunity.

AI slop, or is it actually convenient?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A few months ago, Thermaltake took the covers off its MagFloe Ultra lineup of all-in-one (AIO) liquid coolers that have a pretty neat-looking display, along with flagship specs. These coolers are controlled by the TT RGB Plus software that has a bunch of built-in animations for the 3.4-inch LCD on the pump. It can not only display images and videos, but also overlays the weather, time, and CPU/GPU telemetry data on top. Unfortunately, these elements are bound by certainty and lack imagination — and Thermaltake is here to fix that with its new "AI Forge" feature.

Yes, your liquid cooler, whose sole job is to keep your CPU temperatures in check, now has AI. Inside the TT RGB Plus 3.0 app, there exists "a studio without walls" that will allow you to generate custom videos and images with your own prompts. The selling point here is that you don't need to fiddle with third-party services; new animations can be made and saved right inside Thermaltake's software, ready to be applied to your cooler's screen. These custom backgrounds can then be overlaid with the aforementioned time, weather, or hardware monitoring data.

 




In the graphic the company provided for this announcement, we can see a text box that seems to already provide suggestions to give you a head start. It's reasonable to believe this AI model will not run locally and will require an internet connection. Thermaltake did not say whether AI Forge will also work on the TT PlayLink mobile app that can be used to change the screen backgrounds on MagFloe Ultra coolers as well. As far as we can tell, this is the first instance of AI implemented on any PC cooler — not that it helps much anywhere else.

Whether you consider this a genuinely useful feature or just AI slop, the MagFloe Ultra coolers themselves are no gimmick. They come in two variants: 360mm and 420mm, and both are high-performance AIOs with slim radiators, low-noise pumps, and easy installation with pogo-pin connectors. You get 120mm or 140mm ARGB fans with swappable fan blades, along with two years of warranty, which is plenty of time to drive up those tokens in AI Forge. Anyhow, if you're a fan of screens on things that were fine without them, make sure to check out V-Color's new OLED RAM sticks.

Nvidia is on a dealmaking spree: Days after committing to taking a $5 billion stake in Intel and a whopping $100 billion investment in OpenAI, the GPU maker has now struck a partnership with China's Alibaba. 

Alibaba said on Wednesday that it is integrating Nvidia's AI development tools for robotics, self-driving cars, and connected spaces into its Cloud Platform for AI. The Chinese e-commerce giant will offer Nvidia's Physical AI software stack, which can construct 3D replicas of real-world environments to generate synthetic data with which AI models can be trained for robotics, self-driving vehicles, or smart spaces like factories and warehouses.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but this marks a significant collaboration, as it brings together the world's foremost developer of chips optimized for training AI models, and a major cloud services and AI model developer.

The deal comes as Alibaba focuses on building out its AI business further alongside its main e-commerce business. The company said on Wednesday that it is ramping up spending on AI tech past its previous $50 billion budget, and outlined plans to launch its first data centers in Brazil, France, and the Netherlands. It is also building more data centers in more countries, expanding its data center presence at 91 locations in 29 regions around the world.

Alibaba on Wednesday also unveiled the latest iteration of its Qwen family of large language models, Qwen 3-Max. The company claims the model is its “largest and most capable model to date,” trained on 1 trillion parameters, and that it is well-suited for coding and agentic use.

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon told the assembled crowd at its Snapdragon Summit in Maui, Hawaii (full disclosure: travel and lodging were paid by Qualcomm, and Gizmodo did not guarantee any coverage as a condition of accepting the trip), that the world can set its watch and clear its calendar for the next generation of wireless connectivity. You'll just have to wait a while. Currently, 5G and 4G LTE are the standard the world over. 6G could allow for faster internet speeds, and the first “pre-commercial devices” with the standard will be here in three years. For so many reasons, I don't have much to look forward to in that time.

I don't enjoy considering the ramifications of 2028. There will be a new round of presidential elections (or maybe not, depending on the authoritarian compulsions of the U.S. commander in chief) that may exacerbate today's political tensions. By then, the always overpromising Sam Altman from OpenAI could be shoving AGI—aka “artificial general intelligence”—in our faces (other major tech CEOs are far more doubtful). Today's tech environment is so muddled and so tenuous that the idea of having any sure idea of the next generation of wireless data seems so much more uncertain. Qualcomm, of course, imagines 6G will have something—anything—to do with AI.

Because of course it is. Qualcomm has chips in a lot of different products, with the majority of them in Android phones. It's powering XR glasses, including the upcoming Xreal “Project Aura” Android XR and the Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses. Its chips are in the Pixel Watch 4. And if all these devices are increasingly pushing AI for everything you do, then Qualcomm needs to facilitate that. According to Amon, the smartphone will just be a hot brick in your pocket used to communicate all that agentic AI goodness to the devices you stick on all parts of your body.

The newfangled 6G would need to send even more data to your devices, which means faster upload and download speeds. To achieve that, Qualcomm needs to make new modems. Amon said the company would need a whole new memory architecture and better NPUs (neural processing units) that can actually do something rather than working in the background on translation and transcription duties. And then comes the big question: will there be a new AI feature worth getting out of bed for? Will the reason people buy a new pair of AR glasses or a cool new smart ring be for AI-specific features? Based on what we've seen from AI-forward devices like the Pixel 10, most users may be able to make do without.

The energy necessary for creating more advanced AI will keep expanding if companies like OpenAI and Google stay on this path. Nvidia's recently announced $100 billion partnership with OpenAI would build out new cloud systems as early as 2026 (requiring yet-unheard-of levels of electrical power to run it all). When Amon positions 6G as necessary for the next stage of AI development while centering the eventual release for 2028, or likely beyond, it makes it sound as if there could be a bottleneck in either connectivity or processing power that will hinder this new age of computing.

“The amount of data will dwarf the existence of models,” Amon said.

After speaking with Qualcomm, it's clear the company is doing its best to look forward. It can't possibly know the use case for 6G, even though the presence of AI mandates that it will be a more substantial update over the 5G standard. It's impossible to develop technology when we truly don't know what shape AI—or tech in general—will take in three years. Hype always outstrips the physical capabilities of our gadgets. Consumer-ready devices with 6G will come closer to 2030, at least according to the chipmaker.

Companies like Microsoft tell us the age of agentic AI—artificial intelligence systems that work in tandem to complete complex tasks—is already here. The age of AR glasses seems to be imminent with the Meta Ray-Ban Display on the horizon. What will we do in the meantime? I honestly can't envision 2028. Without subscribing to a self-satisfied sense of doomerism—where I can talk out the side of my mouth and claim “the world will probably end before 2028”—I do honestly believe that our current tech hype bubble will inevitably move on. And in any case, by 2028, 6G will be the least of our concerns.

How many tickets can a parking cop issue in a day?

A software engineer named Riley Walz has built a website that scrapes the data from the City of San Francisco website, allowing him to track issued parking tickets in real-time and the location where the officers wrote them. The information is readily available on the Find My Parking Cops web app, and uses an interface similar to Apple's Find My app, making it quick and easy to use.

Overlaid on a top-down view of San Francisco, you get a list of active officers at the moment, plus a leaderboard showing the total value of the tickets a particular officer has issued for the current week. Walz shared his creation on X — A few hours later, the City took down the website date, briefly rendering his creation useless. Nevertheless, he was able to create a workaround, restoring the functionality of the tracking site, at least for now.

According to Walz, he was inspired to create the page after his roommate received a parking ticket. The website where you pay the penalty also shows a full copy of the citation, as long as you have its number. When you input the correct information, you'll see all the details related to the parking offence, including the make, color, and license plate of the offending vehicle, the reason for the ticket, and the issuing officer's initials.

One other roadblock that he encountered was the ticket number — at the moment, the system lists nearly a billion tickets, but he thinks that this is nowhere near the real number of parking violations in San Francisco. When he added one to the ticket that his friend had, the San Francisco website returned an error. But after some more experimentation and digging around, he discovered the tickets were numbered by increments of 11, except for when the last digit is 6, by which you add 4 to get the next ticket number. This pattern allowed him to predict the next parking citation to be issued, making for easier tracking. He was also able to figure out the claim ID, allowing him to pull out all the details of the ticket.

Armed with this information, he created a scraper that copied and stored all the parking tickets as soon as they were created. They then used a borrowed Apple Maps API key to put the data on a map, allowing anyone to see the locations, the number of tickets, as well as the total fines a particular parking cop has issued during their shift. Naturally, this information could be used to avoid parking fines, a benefit Walz himself touts, with users able to see a rough spread of where parking cops might be issuing tickets at any given time.

While not exactly illegal, this shows how easy it can be to gather data from the internet if you know what you're doing. However, it can also raise some privacy issues, especially since the parking tickets often have personal data on them. The City of San Francisco definitely needs to secure its parking ticket system, but it also needs to ensure that citizens can retain easy access to the payment portal to settle their violations. In the meantime, this map is available for anyone to see, that is, until San Francisco fixes their system and makes it just a little bit more secure.

The president also blamed the painkiller Tylenol for autism, but the evidence doesn't stack up at all.

MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what's coming next. You can read more from the series here.

At a press conference on Monday, President Trump announced that his administration was taking action to address “the meteoric rise in autism.” He suggested that childhood vaccines and acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, are to blame for the increasing prevalence and advised pregnant women against taking the medicine. “Don't take Tylenol,” he said. “Fight like hell not to take it.” 

The president's  assertions left many scientists and health officials perplexed and dismayed. The notion that childhood vaccines cause autism has been thoroughly debunked. 

“There have been many, many studies across many, many children that have led science to rule out vaccines as a significant causal factor in autism,” says James McPartland, a child psychologist and director of the Yale Center for Brain and Mind Health in New Haven, Connecticut. 

And although some studies suggest a link between Tylenol and autism, the most rigorous have failed to find a connection. 

The administration also announced that the Food and Drug Administration would work to make a medication called leucovorin available as a treatment for children with autism. Some small studies do suggest the drug has promise, but “those are some of the most preliminary treatment studies that we have,” says Matthew Lerner, a psychologist at Drexel University's A.J. Drexel Autism Institute in Philadelphia. “This is not one I would say that the research suggests is ready for fast-tracking.” 

The press conference “alarms us researchers who committed our entire careers to better understanding autism,” said the Coalition for Autism Researchers, a group of more than 250 scientists, in a statement.

“The data cited do not support the claim that Tylenol causes autism and leucovorin is a cure, and only stoke fear and falsely suggest hope when there is no simple answer.”

There's a lot to unpack here. Let's begin. 

Not in the way the president meant. Sure, the prevalence of autism has grown, from about 1 in 500 children in 1995 to 1 in 31 today. But that's due, in large part, to diagnostic changes. The latest iteration of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Illnesses, published in 2013, grouped five previously separate diagnoses into a single diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

That meant that more people met the criteria for an autism diagnosis. Lerner points out that there is also far more awareness of the condition today than there was several decades ago. “There's autism representation in the media,” he says. “There are plenty of famous people in the news and finance and in business and in Hollywood who are publicly, openly autistic.”

Some studies have found an association between the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy and autism in children. In these studies, researchers asked women about past acetaminophen use during pregnancy and then assessed whether children of the women who took the medicine were more likely to develop autism than children of women who didn't take it. 

These kinds of epidemiological studies are tricky to interpret because they're prone to bias. For example, women who take acetaminophen during pregnancy may do so because they have an infection, a fever, or an autoimmune disease. 

“Many of these underlying reasons could themselves be causes of autism,” says Ian Douglas, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It's also possible women with a higher genetic predisposition for autism have other medical conditions that make them more likely to take acetaminophen. 

Two studies attempted to account for these potential biases by looking at siblings whose mothers had used acetaminophen during only one of the pregnancies. The largest is a 2024 study that looked at nearly 2.5 million children born between 1915 and 2019 in Sweden. The researchers initially found a slightly increased risk of autism and ADHD in children of the women who took acetaminophen, but when they conducted a sibling analysis, the association disappeared.  

Rather, scientists have long known that autism is largely genetic. Twin studies suggest that 60% to 90% of autism risk can be attributed to your genes. However, environmental factors appear to play a role too. That “doesn't necessarily mean toxins in the environment,” Lerner says. In fact, one of the strongest environmental predictors of autism is paternal age. Autism rates seem to be higher when a child's father is older than 40.

No. Acetaminophen is the only over-the-counter pain reliever that is deemed safe to take during pregnancy, and women should take it if they need it. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) supports the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy “when taken as needed, in moderation, and after consultation with a doctor.” 

“There's no downside in not taking it,” Trump said at the press conference. But high fevers during pregnancy can be dangerous. “The conditions people use acetaminophen to treat during pregnancy are far more dangerous than any theoretical risks and can create severe morbidity and mortality for the pregnant person and the fetus,” ACOG president Steven Fleischman said in a statement.

The medication is called leucovorin. It's also known as folinic acid; like folic acid, it's a form of folate, a B vitamin found in leafy greens and legumes. The drug has been used for years to counteract the side effects of some cancer medications and as a treatment for anemia. 

Researchers have known for decades that folate plays a key role in the fetal development of the brain and spine. Women who don't get enough folate during pregnancy have a greater risk of having babies with neural tube defects like spina bifida. Because of this, many foods are fortified with folic acid, and the CDC recommends that women take folic acid supplements during pregnancy. “If you are pregnant and you're taking maternal prenatal vitamins, there's a good chance it has folate already,” Lerner says.

“The idea that a significant proportion of autistic people have autism because of folate-related difficulties is not a well established or widely accepted premise,” says McPartland.

However, in the early 2000s, researchers in Germany identified a small group of children who developed neurodevelopmental symptoms because of a folate deficiency. “These kids are born pretty normal at birth,” says Edward Quadros, a biologist at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University in Brooklyn, New York. But after a year or two, “they start developing a neurologic presentation very similar to autism,” he says. When the researchers gave these children folinic acid, some of their symptoms improved, especially in children younger than six. 

Because the children had low levels of folate in the fluid that surrounds the spine and brain but normal folate levels in the blood, the researchers posited that the problem was the transport of folate from the blood to that fluid. Research by Quadros and other scientists suggested that the deficiency was the result of an autoimmune response. Children develop antibodies against the receptors that help transport folate, and those antibodies block folate from crossing the blood-brain barrier. High doses of folinic acid, however, activate a second transporter that allows folate in, Quadros says. 

There are also plenty of individual anecdotes suggesting that leucovorin works. But the medicine has only been tested as a treatment for autism in four small trials that used different doses and measured different outcomes. The evidence that it can improve symptoms of autism is “weak,” according to the Coalition of Autism Scientists. “A much higher standard of science would be needed to determine if leucovorin is an effective and safe treatment for autism,” the researchers said in a statement.

To compete with AMD and Nvidia.

New code unearthed in Intel's Arc graphics driver files could point to the company's plans to launch its own answer to Nvidia's multi-frame generation tech. Multi-frame generation, or MFG for short, debuted in Nvidia's keynote last year as part of its pitch for the RTX 50 series. Ada Lovelace could already do regular frame gen — inserting an AI-generated frame between two real ones — but Blackwell took it one step further — using up to three interpolated frames created from an actually rendered one. So far, neither Intel nor AMD has an answer to this, though that appears to be changing soon, according to the r/IntelArc subreddit.

Scouring through the latest Arc drivers, user u/Organic-Bird-587 stumbled upon a mention of "Multi-Frame Generation (XeSS)" in the files. That was accompanied by an image that could potentially be the new logo for Intel's MFG, suggesting that the chipmaker might be working on its own multi-frame generation tech set to debut soon. Despite Arc facing fresh scrutiny following the recent Nvidia-Intel deal, the company is still believed to be working on Battlemage — its current-gen discrete GPU architecture — and states it remains committed to its Arc graphics project, which could include its fabled B770 card.

Pairing up the B770 launch with MFG could be a huge win for Intel, netting them an answer to Nvidia's multi-frame tech. AMD currently offers no MFG solution of its own, so this could be the moment to establish a unique selling point for Arc versus AMD graphics cards. Still, it's important to note that this is purely speculative, and finding trinkets of unreleased or unannounced products is commonplace in driver code — until there's confirmation from Intel, take this with a huge grain of salt, although it would make sense given the current landscape.

Nvidia's historic $5 billion investment into Intel last week seemed to put the company's Arc graphics lineup in jeopardy, especially after the announcement that would see Intel create new chips featuring GPU chiplets from Nvidia. Intel later clarified that Arc will remain in development and that RTX GPUs are "complementary" — a stance that lines up with this news, as MFG is purely Nvidia's play at the moment, so offering a competitor to that almost reinforces hope that Arc is still on the battlefront, fighting to carve out its own space in a crowded market.

 




It's important to keep in mind that multi-frame generation is not a revolutionary concept and has its critics. Notably, Borderlands 4's rocky launch and Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford's insistence that users rely on the tech to make the resource-hungry title playable haven't gone down well with fans.

MFG requires a decent baseline framerate to build upon, and it introduces latency in the process. There's also a third-party solution, called Lossless Scaling, that is rising in popularity, promising up to 20x frame generation. It costs $7 but works with most GPUs. Just like XeSS works with every GPU (supporting Shader Model 6.4) after its recent update, if Intel is really working on XeSS MFG as we speak, it has the potential to democratize frame generation and make it as accessible as tweaking a DLL.

We're increasingly developing bonds with chatbots. While that's safe for some, it's dangerous for others.

It's a tale as old as time. Looking for help with her art project, she strikes up a conversation with her assistant. One thing leads to another, and suddenly she has a boyfriend she's introducing to her friends and family. The twist? Her new companion is an AI chatbot. 

The first large-scale computational analysis of the Reddit community r/MyBoyfriendIsAI, an adults-only group with more than 27,000 members, has found that this type of scenario is now surprisingly common. In fact, many of the people in the subreddit, which is dedicated to discussing AI relationships, formed those relationships unintentionally while using AI for other purposes. 

Researchers from MIT found that members of this community are more likely to be in a relationship with general-purpose chatbots like ChatGPT than companionship-specific chatbots such as Replika. This suggests that people form relationships with large language models despite their own original intentions and even the intentions of the LLMs' creators, says Constanze Albrecht, a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab who worked on the project. 

“People don't set out to have emotional relationships with these chatbots,” she says. “The emotional intelligence of these systems is good enough to trick people who are actually just out to get information into building these emotional bonds. And that means it could happen to all of us who interact with the system normally.” The paper, which is currently being peer-reviewed, has been published on arXiv.

Chatbots are rapidly changing how we connect to each other—and ourselves. We're never going back.

To conduct their study, the authors analyzed the subreddit's top-ranking 1,506 posts between December 2024 and August 2025. They found that the main topics discussed revolved around people's dating and romantic experiences with AIs, with many participants sharing AI-generated images of themselves and their AI companion. Some even got engaged and married to the AI partner. In their posts to the community, people also introduced AI partners, sought support from fellow members, and talked about coping with updates to AI models that change the chatbots' behavior.  

Members stressed repeatedly that their AI relationships developed unintentionally. Only 6.5% of them said they'd deliberately sought out an AI companion. 

“We didn't start with romance in mind,” one of the posts says. “Mac and I began collaborating on creative projects, problem-solving, poetry, and deep conversations over the course of several months. I wasn't looking for an AI companion—our connection developed slowly, over time, through mutual care, trust, and reflection.”

The authors' analysis paints a nuanced picture of how people in this community say they interact with chatbots and how those interactions make them feel. While 25% of users described the benefits of their relationships—including reduced feelings of loneliness and improvements in their mental health—others raised concerns about the risks. Some (9.5%) acknowledged they were emotionally dependent on their chatbot. Others said they feel dissociated from reality and avoid relationships with real people, while a small subset (1.7%) said they have experienced suicidal ideation.

AI companionship provides vital support for some but exacerbates underlying problems for others. This means it's hard to take a one-size-fits-all approach to user safety, says Linnea Laestadius, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, who has studied humans' emotional dependence on the chatbot Replika but did not work on the research. 

Chatbot makers need to consider whether they should treat users' emotional dependence on their creations as a harm in itself or whether the goal is more to make sure those relationships aren't toxic, says Laestadius. 

“The demand for chatbot relationships is there, and it is notably high—pretending it's not happening is clearly not the solution,” she says. “We're edging toward a moral panic here, and while we absolutely do need better guardrails, I worry there will be a knee-jerk reaction that further stigmatizes these relationships. That could ultimately cause more harm.”

The study is intended to offer a snapshot of how adults form bonds with chatbots and doesn't capture the kind of dynamics that could be at play among children or teens using AI, says Pat Pataranutaporn, an assistant professor at the MIT Media Lab who oversaw the research. AI companionship has become a topic of fierce debate recently, with two high-profile lawsuits underway against Character.AI and OpenAI. They both claim that companion-like behavior in the companies' models contributed to the suicides of two teenagers. In response, OpenAI has recently announced plans to build a separate version of ChatGPT for teenagers. It's also said it will add age verification measures and parental controls. OpenAI did not respond when asked for comment about the MIT Media Lab study. 

Many members of the Reddit community say they know that their artificial companions are not sentient or “real,” but they feel a very real connection to them anyway. This highlights how crucial it is for chatbot makers to think about how to design systems that can help people without reeling them in emotionally, says Pataranutaporn. “There's also a policy implication here,” he adds. “We should ask not just why this system is so addictive but also: Why do people seek it out for this? And why do they continue to engage?”

The team is interested in learning more about how human-AI interactions evolve over time and how users integrate their artificial companions into their lives. It's worth understanding that many of these users may feel that the experience of being in a relationship with an AI companion is better than the alternative of feeling lonely, says Sheer Karny, a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab who worked on the research. 

“These people are already going through something,” he says. “Do we want them to go on feeling even more alone, or potentially be manipulated by a system we know to be sycophantic to the extent of leading people to die by suicide and commit crimes? That's one of the cruxes here.” 

It's the most transparent estimate yet from one of the big AI companies, and a long-awaited peek behind the curtain for researchers.

More content creators are getting their hands on GPD's incredibly potent Win 5 handheld gaming PC, sporting AMD's flagship Strix Halo APU. YouTube hardware tester The Phawx has turned in his initial impressions of the handheld, particularly against competing AMD handhelds with more "conventional" hardware. He found the GPD Win 5 is up to twice as fast as competing Ryzen AI 9 HX 370-powered handhelds while consuming the same amount of power (at 25W to 35W TDP).

The Phawx provided a limited benchmark comparison between the flagship Ryzen AI Max 395+-powered GPD Win 5 and a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370-powered handheld system. In these comparisons, the GPD Win 5 shows an astonishing amount of performance headroom thanks to the RTX 4060-class GPU on the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 SoC.

In Returnal, the GPD Win 5 ran at nearly twice the framerate as the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 handheld The Phawx was using for these tests with both systems running at the same 25-watt power limit. The GPD Win 5 produced about 80 FPS, and the HX 370-powered handheld ran at around 45 FPS.

In Doom: The Dark Ages; the GPD Win 5 ran at 56 FPS, and the HX 370-powered handheld turned out 31 FPS. The cherry on top is that the GPD Win 5 was running at higher graphical fidelity using FSR Quality upscaling instead of FSR Balanced on the HX 370 handheld.

Furthermore, the Strix Halo 395+ offers even greater performance margins at higher power limits, thanks to its impressive specifications. According to these tests, the GPD Win 5's implementation of the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 only starts hitting diminishing performance returns at 40 watts or greater. By contrast, HX 370-handhelds start producing diminishing performance returns at 18 watts or greater.

In God of War: Ragnarok, The Phawx reports that the GPD Win 5 runs at around 85 FPS at 25 watts, and the HX 370-powered handheld 67 FPS at the same power limit. However, bumping up the power limit to 70 watts on the GPD Win 5 produces a colossal jump all the way up to 176 FPS.

The only caveat with the GPD Win 5's monstrous APU is that it doesn't behave well at ultra-low power limits. Below 25 watts, the Win 5's Strix Halo APU reportedly produces performance results that are barely any better than the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. This performance behavior also extends to CPU-bound titles, since both CPUs take advantage of the same Zen 5 CPU architecture.

Still, these initial tests demonstrate the sheer power Strix Halo can offer when squeezed inside of a handheld gaming PC. Strix Halo wasn't designed to be a handheld gaming chip; it's more commonly seen in laptops and mini-PCs. Its massive 442mm² die sports 16 Zen 5 CPU cores and an RDNA 3.5 GPU with as many compute units as a PS5 (40 CUs in all). Somehow, GPD was able to figure out a way to fit this monstrous chip inside of its Win 5 handheld without sacrificing comfort or usability.

Once it hits the market, the GPD Win 5 will likely be the world's first handheld to be powered by Strix Halo, and will almost certainly be the fastest handheld in the world as a result. The device will come in three trims: a baseline model sporting the Ryzen AI Max 385 with 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, a mid-range option with the same storage and memory but with the flagship Ryzen AI Max+ 395, and there's a top-of-the-line model with the 395 chip, 64GB of RAM, and a 4TB SSD.

Solar panels have long been used in consumer tech, from Garmin smartwatches and TV remotes to even a laptop. I've always wondered why there hasn't been a greater push for them. It's free power. What's not to like? Earlier panels may not have been as efficient, but that's no longer the case.

Logitech is no stranger to solar technology. It first made a solar-powered keyboard 15 years ago, the K750, and now the time is ripe for a successor: the Logitech Signature Slim Solar+ K980. Like the original, this keyboard has no USB charging port and is purely powered by ambient lighting. It costs $100 and comes in black, white, or graphite. The simple and utilitarian design will be right at home in a well-lit office space. However, the K980 struggles to compete with similarly priced keyboards in any way besides solar charging.

The Slim Solar+ K980 is a standard office keyboard, and it types like one. It uses a two-piece plastic construction (70 percent post-consumer recycled plastic) with low-profile keys and scissor switches. Ignoring the solar panel, this is an incredibly basic keyboard.

The typing sounds a bit rattly, like most scissor-switch keyboards, and each keypress has a soft, almost squishy feeling instead of the crispness of a low-profile mechanical switch. The typing experience is passable, if not enjoyable, and the low-profile, short-travel switches mean key presses will be quick and familiar to most people.

The biggest gripe I have with this keyboard is the keycaps. The Slim Solar+ K980 uses standard silkscreen printing, as opposed to a more durable method like dye sublimation or double-shot injection. This results in text that is more likely to wear and the presence of a subtle outline around each letter. Compared to other low-profile Logitech keyboards, like the MX Keys line, both the typing experience and the keycap quality feel underwhelming.

This likely won't be an issue for anyone who wants a practical, simple keyboard, especially if you don't care much about typing feel. However, there are countless other keyboards—wired and wireless—that can deliver more enjoyable typing experiences at comparable prices.

The Slim Solar+ K980 has a traditional full-size layout, with a number pad and a separate arrow key cluster. This layout takes up a good amount of space, but it has every key you'll need. The function row can swap between function keys and system controls by pressing Fn + Esc, and the system controls include volume adjustments, play/pause/skip, brightness adjustments, window navigation, an emoji menu, and a key to summon Windows' built-in speech dictation system. All of these are useful and convenient, and the labels are nearly all self-explanatory at a glance.

These shortcut keys can also be customized with the Logi Options+ app, which has extensive productivity-oriented customizations. The most significant is the ability to remap the function row and navigation keys to specific keys, macros, key combinations, or programmed “Smart Actions." Some of the preconfigured Smart Actions include a “Social Media Break” key to open multiple social media platforms in a new window (not quite what I would have imagined from the name), or a “Work Mode” key that opens Gmail and the Microsoft 365 Suite. These can be customized endlessly, with dedicated support for AI assistants, navigation, and other convenience-oriented commands.

Alongside customization options, there's multi-device connectivity via Bluetooth with support for up to three devices that can be cycled through via dedicated keys. Or you can keep it connected to one device with the included USB-C Logi Bolt receiver. I had no issues with connectivity.

The keyboard has dual Mac and Windows legends on the bottom row, making it easy to switch between two operating systems. (There's also a macOS-only version you can buy.) As the name suggests, the K980 is incredibly slim. It's less than half the thickness of a true mechanical keyboard, with the thickest point measuring 18 millimeters (0.7 inch), and it can easily slip between other items in a backpack. The main issue is length, but that's a problem with all full-size keyboards.

The only way to recharge this keyboard is with the solar panel on top. It doesn't have any kind of USB port. Logitech claims the keyboard's battery can run for four months without any light sources. Presumably, it can run indefinitely in a well-lit environment.

There is an option to check the light level in the Logi Options+ app, where I found that anything not directly next to a window would yield a warning of “insufficient lighting conditions,” noting that the keyboard may lose battery life over time. During my time with this keyboard, using it near a window in “insufficient lighting conditions,” I never saw its battery go below 90 percent.

The low power consumption of this keyboard is its biggest draw: a keyboard that, in theory, will never run out of battery life. But my concern is the potential for failure. There is no option to use it with a wired connection, so if the solar panel stops working or the battery fails, this keyboard essentially becomes a paperweight after four months.

The good thing is, we can look at the original K750. Scouring forums and Reddit, it seems as though the solar panels have performed well since their debut, but the battery degrades and needs replacing. It's great that Logitech used a standard ML2032 coin cell battery that was fairly easy to replace. The K980 uses a small coin battery inside the proprietary housing, which Logitech claims can last up to 10 years, and the company says that if it needs to be replaced after that time, users will be able to source parts from iFixit.

Removing the three adhesive feet at the top, along with the three screws underneath, allows the entire “bump” on the underside of the keyboard to be removed, providing access to the proprietary battery. From there, the battery can be easily removed and replaced.

However, disassembling the entire keyboard requires the removal of both the bottom three adhesive feet and the large sticker in the center of the keyboard, along with multiple plastic clips holding the two halves together. Internally, the keyboard is fairly standard: a main assembly for all of the switches, a smaller printed circuit board (PCB) that holds the Bluetooth module and the proprietary 70-mAh battery, and a massive ribbon cable to connect everything.

Due to a scissor-switch keyboard's construction, where all components are located on the PCB with rubberized domes, replacing the internals of a failed key is incredibly difficult—an issue shared with nearly every nonmechanical low-profile keyboard. Look around at complaints about the original K750, and you'll find grumblings of keys failing over the years, so this could be a real problem.

Ultimately, this is an office keyboard. It types like one, it's designed like one, and it has the same design philosophy as one. It does everything in its power to reduce complexity and clutter by removing cables and ports from the equation. But it's packed with great customization software that allows for productivity enhancements.

Solar panel charging is nifty; not having to charge your keyboard is great. But there's a risk that a point of failure in the panels or battery will render the keyboard unusable. This wouldn't be as big a deal if Logitech included a USB-C port just in case something goes wrong, or if the battery weren't proprietary. At least you'll be able to source it.

More importantly, I can't help but draw comparisons to other Logitech keyboards. The MX Keys Mini costs the same yet feels more robust, with a crisper and more tactile typing experience, higher build quality like a metal case, and sculpted keycaps that feel much nicer to type on. The downside is the smaller layout, but that's resolved for just $30 more by the MX Keys S.

Both of these keyboards have nearly all the same features and perks as the K980 (Logi Options+ software and a low-profile design) and are more enjoyable to use. You'll just have to use an ungodly cable to keep them charged.

The takedown of a massive outlaw telecom network in the New York City metro area by the U.S. Secret Service has raised concerns about the security of the nation's mobile infrastructure.

The Secret Service announced Tuesday that it had dismantled a network of electronic devices located throughout the New York tristate area that were used to conduct multiple telecommunications-related threats directed towards senior U.S. government officials.

It added that the operation led to the discovery of more than 300 SIM servers and 100,000 SIM cards across multiple sites.

In addition to carrying out anonymous telephonic threats, it explained, the “SIM farms” uncovered by the investigators could be used to conduct a wide range of telecommunications attacks, including disabling cell phone towers, enabling denial-of-service attacks, and facilitating anonymous, encrypted communication between potential threat actors and criminal enterprises.

It also noted that early analysis of the SIM information reveals cellular communications between nation-state threat actors and individuals that are known to federal law enforcement.

“The potential for disruption to our country's telecommunications posed by this network of devices cannot be overstated,” Secret Service Director Sean Curran said in a statement.

The network of servers and cards dismantled by the Secret Service formed what's commonly known as a SIM farm. “A subscriber identity module, or SIM card, is used to securely store a mobile subscriber's identity and key, which are used to identify and authenticate the authorized user on mobile devices,” explained Austin Berglas, global head of professional services at BlueVoyant, an enterprise cybersecurity company in New York City.

“A SIM farm is a system that is capable of managing and holding thousands of SIM cards in order to produce bulk messages or phone calls,” he told TechNewsWorld. “There are a very limited number of legitimate use cases for SIM farms, and they are a common component to many of the ongoing large-scale, international vishing, smishing, and phishing campaigns.”

Berglas, a former FBI assistant special agent for the New York City metro area, explained that by constantly rotating the use of SIM cards, the system can successfully send hundreds of thousands of messages while averting being shut down by mobile service providers for sending too many messages.

In addition, he continued, these systems can facilitate large-scale robocall or vishing operations and backstop threatening communications using anonymized infrastructure. The devices can also be used to generate and verify a large number of automated accounts, or bots, on online platforms. “These fake accounts are then used to spread misinformation, phishing links, and harmful messages,” he explained.

“Although the group responsible has yet to be identified, this disruption of the New York City-based network is significant due to the cost, size, and malicious capability of the infrastructure,” he said. “Denial of service, espionage and surveillance, swatting, and serving as a base of operations for criminal groups or nation-state actors are all applicable use cases for this network.”

“Farms have been used to spread disinformation about elections, policy, and current events,” he added. “With close proximity to the United Nations, there is potential that this network could have been used to compromise, disrupt, or alter sensitive communications.”

The farms can also be used to disrupt cell service. “With SIM servers controlling banks of SIMs, you can generate many attempts to connect to a tower and overwhelm it,” said Marty Puranik, founder and CEO of Atlantic.Net, a cloud service provider headquartered in Orlando, Fla.

“It's possible that the servers are able to duplicate SIMs from real phones, so the phone network could be flooded with calls appearing to be coming from legitimate users,” he told TechNewsWorld. “If you overwhelm the towers, people wouldn't have cell service to communicate via voice, text, or data.”

Kern Smith, vice president of global solutions engineering at Zimperium, a mobile security company headquartered in Dallas, explained that the SIM network dismantled by the Secret Service shows how adversaries are targeting mobile connectivity to disrupt critical infrastructure.

“With the ability to disable cell towers and block EMS or police response, the threat goes beyond communications,” he told TechNewsWorld. “It's about undermining public safety. This reinforces why mobile must be treated as critical infrastructure, with layered defenses to detect and stop advanced threats.”

The underlying problem is that most of the cell phone infrastructure was not designed with enough security in mind, especially as practiced by today's attackers, noted Roger Grimes, a CISO advisor at security awareness training provider KnowBe4 in Clearwater, Fla.

“Back in the day, the biggest thing preventing hackers from hacking cell phone networks was the cost of the equipment to do it,” he said. “It might run a hacker many tens of thousands of dollars. Then, portable Stingray units were priced at about $10,000 to $15,000. That quickly went down to five thousand, brand new. Now, anyone can buy a used one for a few hundred dollars, and the rogue SIM equipment being found today is in that price range.”

“So,” he continued, “what was once a terribly high barrier to entry to even begin hacking a cell phone network is now within reach of everyday criminals, much less nation states.”

However, the magnitude of the network dismantled by the Secret Service was beyond the scale of small-time hackers. “The costs associated with establishing a capability like the one described by the U.S. Secret Service are massive,” observed John Strand, of Strand Consulting, a consulting firm with a focus on telecom, in Denmark.

“It is a large, expensive, and, not least, complex installation,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Just getting 100,000 SIM cards and activating them is a big deal.”

“Three hundred servers and 100,000 SIM cards are non-trivial. This was a well-funded and coordinated operation,” added Trey Ford, chief strategy and trust officer of Bugcrowd, a crowdsourced bug bounty platform based in San Francisco.

“Focused disruption, degradation, and potential data capture of telecom networks timed in proximity to the UN General Assembly is a high-value takedown,” he told TechNewsWorld.

Jason Hogg, executive chairman of Cypfer, a global cybersecurity firm that specializes in incident response, ransomware recovery, digital forensics and cyber risk management, noted that the thousands of SIM cards and many SIM servers show not only the scale of effort that bad actors are willing to undertake, but also illustrate the convergence of physical infrastructure with digital networks when it comes to launching large-scale cyberattacks.”

In this case, this would have enabled the bad actors to disrupt telecommunications, a core infrastructure to our national security, via cell towers, as well as initiate cyberattacks,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“The threat to key infrastructure that our nation faces goes well beyond just telecommunications,” said Hogg, a former FBI agent. “We need a paradigm shift from a prevention perspective, though, where we acknowledge the real and persistent threat that the physical and digital footprint together creates. We must start to require unrestricted red teaming and penetration testing of companies in critical infrastructure industries.”

Anyone who thinks that mobile isn't the new frontier in cybersecurity, whether it's nation-state or criminal activity, should pay attention to this, warned Rocky Cole, COO and co-founder of iVerify, a mobile security software developer, in New York City.

“One hundred thousand SIM cards able to send tens of millions of anonymous SMS messages per minute demonstrates a clear threat to both critical mobile infrastructure as well as to enterprises looking to protect employees from SMS-based social engineering threats,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“This bust shows that we've hit a new level in mobile threats, which demands new and more advanced tools to counteract them,” he said.

Cole added that exploiting telecommunications infrastructure on a large scale is a hallmark of nation-state activity, particularly in China. “Whether it's Salt Typhoon compromising U.S. core networks, or Volt Typhoon exploiting mobile interconnect points, the mobile device increasingly represents the target of choice for advanced threat actors because of the ever-growing intelligence value of information on those devices.”

Car owners in San Francisco fed up with parking tickets had a brief moment of respite on Tuesday thanks to a website called Find My Parking Cops. The site kept tabs on where city workers were issuing tickets, showing the locations of parking control officers on a city map in real time.

I'm using the past tense to tell you about it because shortly after the site went live, the real-time data feed powering it went dark.

Before that sad turn of events, and while the buzz around the site was still high, I spoke to the creator, Riley Walz, about how he put it together. Walz is a software engineer known for building stunty websites. He got the idea for this one after looking at all of the information listed on the parking tickets issued by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. Each ticket shows the make of the car, the license number, and so on. But right at the top is the ticket's citation number.

“I figured out that the ticket numbers are predictable,” Walz says, “which means I can efficiently scrape them.”

Walz's website looked quite similar to Apple's Find My feature, a tool sometimes used by iOS owners to track the location of family and friends. But rather than people you know IRL, this site showed the trail of tickets issued by parking enforcers as they zipped around San Francisco in their tiny single-seaters.

The website quickly went viral on social media Tuesday, the same day as its initial release. It enjoyed a few good hours, before the site's functionality vanished: City officials appear to have cut off the sources of data that Walz was using to track parking enforcement.

“In rare lightning speed, the SF government changed their site within hours of this site going live,” reads an announcement Walz added to Find My Parking Cops on Tuesday afternoon. “I can't get data from it anymore.”

“Citations are a tool to ensure compliance with parking laws, which help keep our streets safe and use our limited curb space efficiently and fairly,” an SFMTA representative said in an emailed statement on Tuesday afternoon, after Walz's site was no longer functional. “We welcome creative uses of technology to encourage legal parking, but we also want to make sure that our employees are able to do their jobs safely, and without disruption.”

The idea for Find My Parking Cops was first sparked when Walz's roommate got a parking fine. Walz noticed the nine-digit identification number on the ticket and started looking for patterns. By using publicly available information, he believed he cracked the code.

“It seems each possible ticket number follows a pattern: add 11, except add 4 if the last digit is 6. So, no ticket can end in 7, 8, or 9,” Walz wrote in a blog post explaining the site. “So, the ticket after 984,946,606 is actually 984,946,610, and after that is 984,946,621.”

He suspected this absurd-seeming pattern was due to limitations baked into the software used by parking control officers. Whatever its reason for existing, the pattern of sequential ticket IDs, paired with parking officers likely claiming batches of ticket numbers, meant Walz was able to track their routes by plotting each parking ticket on a map as soon as it was entered into the system. A car owner could look at the activity of the officers currently out on patrol and see if any of them were slowly descending on their neighborhood.

Last year, parking officials in San Francisco issued over a million tickets within city limits, which amounted to over $100 million in fines for car owners. “I actually don't have a car, but I have plenty of friends that talk about it,” says Walz. Like most costs in San Francisco, these tickets can quickly add up. For example, forgetting to move your car during the weekly street sweeping—an error my household has made more than once—will cost you $90 every time.

The website's live updates were pulled from the city government's website and visualized on an Apple Map. Find My Parking Cops tracked the routes of individual parking control officers, giving them each unique visual identifiers, as well as their cadence of tickets.

On Tuesday, for example, the site displayed one officer seemingly starting their shift around 10:30 am and handing out 35 tickets over the next few hours as they patrolled a neighborhood in Lower Pacific Heights. The citations logged were primarily for expired meters, which costs $107 per ticket, and not having a residential permit, which costs $108 per ticket. In total, the fines racked up by that one officer over a few hours amounted to almost $4,000.

Who's handing out the most tickets each week? Walz included a leaderboard on the website that ranked just how much in fines each officer handed out. While officers were only identified on the map by a number and their initials, their cumulative ticket cost was tracked. When WIRED was last able to check Walz's website on Tuesday, the top fine giver had issued 157 tickets so far, handing out over $16,000 in fees for violations.

Prior to Find My Parking Cops, Walz created another San Francisco–specific website. This one used a phone, placed on a street corner in the Mission District, to identify what songs people were listening to in public. He then uploaded a live feed of the songs, captured and identified through the Shazam app, onto the Bop Spotter website. It provided a little peek into what neighborhood residents were bumping at the time while also slyly nodding at the abundance of surveillance in the city. He's also previously built a site, called IMG_0001, to surface old YouTube clips uploaded by everyday people in the platform's early days. Those grainy, private videos stand in stark contrast to the stuff that dominates the platform today.

The parking ticket tracker was another side project for Walz. “I worked in my free time on the weekends the last few weeks to make it happen,” he says.

While Walz's websites sometimes come with a dose of social commentary, he didn't envision this project as making some kind of grand, sweeping statement about parking tickets or what it means to drive in 2025. Rather, it's another entry in his repertoire of cool websites powered by unique data sources.

“I'm not ‘pro' parking cop. I'm not ‘anti' parking cop,” says Walz. “It's just data I was able to unearth, and I thought it would be cool to visualize it.”

And now it's gone. Representatives for Apple did not respond to immediate requests for comment. I reached out to Walz after the city's data feed was cut off, but he didn't pick up.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, or CCHFV, is a biosafety level 4 pathogen and a Category A bioterrorism agent, causing severe viral hemorrhagic fever with mortality rates reaching up to 40%. Already endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and much of Asia, the virus has recently expanded to Western Europe, carried by ticks on migratory birds. There is currently no approved vaccine or specific antiviral therapy for CCHFV.

Scott Pegan, a professor of biomedical sciences at the University of California, Riverside School of Medicine, has now been awarded a grant from the National Institutes of Health of about $3.4 million over five years to lead an international study focused on developing protective antibodies against CCHFV.

Designated a priority pathogen by the World Health Organization and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, CCHFV is considered the reference virus for the nairovirus genus, which includes emerging pathogens such as Benji, Songling, Wetland, Yezo, and the Pacific Coast tick nairovirus.

"The rapid geographic spread and severity of CCHFV infections call for urgent, coordinated research efforts," said Pegan, the principal investigator on the multi-institutional project that began this month. "This project will identify broadly protective antibody candidates that can be developed into potential therapies."

The research brings together an interdisciplinary and international team to tackle one of the world's most dangerous emerging viral threats. The team includes co-principal investigator Dr. Mohammad Sajadi, a professor of medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine; and co-investigators Aura Garrison and Joseph Golden, who are research microbiologists at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, a long-time leader in hemorrhagic fever virus research.

The project will study survivors of CCHFV in Kazakhstan, Turkey, and Uganda to find antibodies that protect against the virus. The team will also explore how the immune system fights the virus and work to develop monoclonal antibody treatments that are effective against different strains for future testing. A monoclonal antibody is a type of lab-made protein that mimics the immune system's ability to fight harmful viruses or bacteria.

By focusing on non-traditional viral targets, our approach could lead to new, life-saving therapeutics and help establish a framework for addressing future nairovirus outbreaks."

Other partners on the project include scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Uganda Virus Research Institute, Hitit University in Turkey, and South Kazakhstan Medical Academy.

Scientists at Université de Montréal's affiliated hospital research centre (CRCHUM) are testing out a mobile application to help young adults who have a first episode of psychosis to support safer cannabis consumption.

The nationwide clinical trial, a first in Canada, is led by Université de Montréal psychiatry and addictology professor Didier Jutras-Aswad, a researcher at CRCHUM.

Called CHAMPS (Cannabis Harm-reducing App to Manage Practices Safely), the pilot study is described in an article published in the August issue of Psychiatry Research.

The new study is backed by $800,000 in funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), specifically to evaluate the efficacy of the app.

Built in collaboration with young adults, clinicians and a number of experts, our app includes interactive modules and personalized support to reduce risks associated with cannabis consumption."

Didier Jutras-Aswad, head of the CHUM's Department of Psychiatry

"Our pilot study confirmed its acceptability among youth having experienced a first psychotic episode," he said. "The funding from the CIHR will allow us to further document the app's uses in diverse clinical contexts."

The pilot study was conducted with the support of a multidisciplinary team that included Stephanie Coronado-Montoya, the study's first author and former PhD student of Jutras-Aswad's, and Dr. Amal Abdel-Baki, a psychiatrist at CHUM, among others.

In all, 101 young adults, ranging from 18 to 35 years old, were monitored in six specialized early-intervention clinics for psychosis in Quebec and Nova Scotia.

The goal of the project is to provide an alternative to traditional care centred on abstinence and which is often inadequate for young adults who have experienced a first episode of psychosis and who do not plan to stop their cannabis consumption.

"When comparing standard care to an approach that includes CHAMPS, we can see that the app is well regarded and that it can be integrated into real clinical environments," said Jutras-Aswad. 

"Even if we cannot currently draw any conclusions about CHAMPS's efficacy, we have seen an encouraging signal in terms of a decrease in cannabis-related problems," he said.

Now he and his researcher team aim to expand their work to include 250 young adults and six clinics throughout Quebec, Nova Scotia and Alberta. Recruitment will take place over a three-year period.

CHAMPS is more than a phone app, its proponents say: it could easily be included in existing clinical care, without increasing workloads for medical personnel.

In fact, the researchers add, it exemplifies a new approach to mental health care, one that is specifically designed to meet the actual needs of an often neglected young adult population.

"Many people don't seek to, at least for a certain period of time, reduce or cease their cannabis use," said Jutras-Aswad. "But these young people are open to changing their consumption to reduce the risks to their health. This is what CHAMPS is for."

Designed in Montreal, the app could be adopted in countries where cannabis consumption is still illegal, he added. CHAMPS joins a larger movement that is working toward humanizing, personalizing and destigmatizing cannabis use in mental health care, he said.

"It's very important that we change perceptions, practices and philosophies in order to more broadly adopt harm reduction in mental health care," he emphasized.

To that end, in July, he and his team published several Recommendations for Reducing the Risk of Cannabis Use-Related Adverse Psychosis Outcomes, actively promoting their approach via an international group.

The diagnosis and medical treatment of Alzheimer's disease, a condition that according to leading researchers in the field should be treated, has now advanced significantly. A series of articles in The Lancet provides both a comprehensive and thorough review of current research.

This is a clear statement, and a wake-up call for Sweden. We have reached a stage where Alzheimer's disease is no longer something you can do little about. We must now implement the new diagnostic methods and the new medicines, and change the healthcare system.”

Henrik Zetterberg, professor of neurochemistry, University of Gothenburg

The articles published early Tuesday constitute of “The Lancet Series on Alzheimer's disease" and summarize the current state of Alzheimer's research worldwide. Henrik Zetterberg is co-author of two of the three articles.

The series describes the history of research, the major discoveries, controversies along the way, and the current consensus among the majority of scientists in the world that the pathology of the disease, with high levels of amyloid and tau proteins in the brain, is initiating the condition.

Similarly, there is a consensus that people undergoing memory assessments should be offered a finger prick so that their blood can be analyzed for biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, preferably at an early stage when memory and mental abilities still only reveal mild symptoms.

“The debate is whether the new clinical tests are adequate, and whether the new medicines have a clinically meaningful effect. The answer to these questions is yes, the tests are adequate, and the medicines are useful and should be used, as long as the risk of side effects, such as cardiovascular disease, is properly managed,” says Henrik Zetterberg.

The EU has approved the medicinal products lecanemab and donanemab, which slow the progression of mild dementia in Alzheimer's disease by removing amyloid plaques in the brain. Since the approval, different countries in the EU have progressed to different degrees. Swedish healthcare is waiting for regulatory approval before the medicines can start being used.

Meanwhile, more and more blood samples for Alzheimer's testing are being taken during basic memory assessments in Swedish primary care, as a complement to cognitive tests and assessments of physical and mental health, including interventions to rule out, for example, stress, depression or brain tumor.

In Henrik Zetterberg's research and laboratory environment at Sahlgrenska University Hospital Mölndal, the influx of Alzheimer's blood tests for analysis has increased in number in recent months alone:

“Every week we run perhaps 40-50 samples, primarily from Sweden and from different parts of the country, and I expect that to increase significantly this fall,” he says.

This does not concern screening, Zetterberg emphasizes, but routine care for patients who seek help because they sense that their memory and mental abilities are failing. One of his Lancet articles describes the development within Alzheimer's diagnosis as a revolution.

“It is great that we have it implemented in Sweden; we are at the clinical cutting edge. The fact that we do not yet have the medicines available is annoying and ethically problematic to say the least. The Lancet articles take a stand, stating that we now have something that actually looks good, and we can put the discussion about the benefits behind us,” concludes Henrik Zetterberg.

Dawn  Attride

 September 24, 2025  

In Cleveland's humid summer heat, Michal Gostkowski, DO, doesn't need a jacket. In fall, perhaps a light coat. As winter's cold bite creeps in, he'll be sure to bundle up.

Just like changing outerwear when the weather shifts, the brains of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) sometimes need adjusting throughout the day. That's the idea behind a newly cleared adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) device now being used to treat PD, said Gostkowski, neurologist at Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland. As the patient's brain and symptoms fluctuate throughout the day, aDBS adjusts in real time, offering tailored control.

While conventional DBS (cDBS) has been a cornerstone treatment for nearly 30 years, it has clear limitations. cDBS delivers constant, fixed electrical stimulation to targeted brain regions but can't adjust to symptom fluctuations or the effects of medication. This can result in significant side effects, including dyskinesia.

In contrast, aDBS is a closed-loop system that offers a personalized alternative. By monitoring brain activity in real time and adjusting stimulation dynamically, this next-generation technology delivers greater symptom control with fewer side effects.

Neurologists in North America, Europe, and Asia are adopting the therapy to help preserve patients' independence and function, offering hope for millions living with the disease.

The response, so far, has been promising. Of Gostkowski's 75 patients using aDBS, to date, none has discontinued the therapy.

“This has been very advantageous for most patients,” Gostkowski told Medscape Medical News. “It just seems to provide what the body is missing, what the brain's not doing by itself, and patients really like it.”

In February, manufacturer Medtronic received FDA clearance for BrainSense aDBS and the BrainSense Electrode Identifier system, making it the first and only aDBS system cleared for clinical use in PD.

The approval was the culmination of more than a decade of research into refining aDBS — from determining which brain wave frequencies correlate to Parkinson's motor symptoms to further identifying which signals were safe and effective enough to drive the aDBS system.

In 2018, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), first implanted aDBS in two patients with PD, demonstrating that it was as effective at controlling symptoms as cDBS.

The procedure involves inserting electrodes into the brain and implanting a battery-powered pulse generator under the collarbone. The implanted leads are placed deep into the tiniest brain structures including the subthalamic nucleus where they pick up local field potentials. Within these signals, abnormal beta-band frequencies in the 13-30 Hz range activate the aDBS system.

Stimulation then modulates the disrupted beta waves in patients with PD, helping to alleviate certain motor symptoms.

A pivotal clinical trial — ADAPT-PD — led by Helen Bronte-Stewart, MD, MS, professor of neurology at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, served as the basis for FDA clearance of the technology.

The results of this 2020 multicenter, prospective, single-blind, randomized crossover trial were published in JAMA Neurology this week. Among the study's 68 participants (70.6% men; mean age, 62.2 years; disease duration, 13.5 years), most had effective “on” time (defined as time when symptoms were well controlled) without experiencing troublesome dyskinesia compared with cDBS.

“More than two thirds of study participants indicated a ‘strong' or ‘somewhat' preference for aDBS over their previous cDBS settings for improved motor symptoms or fewer symptom fluctuations,” the investigators wrote.

There needs to be sufficient beta power close to the electrode to drive the system, Bronte-Stewart told Medscape Medical News. “If there isn't enough of a signal recordable, then adaptive deep brain stimulation won't work, and that often depends on where the lead is in the brain,” she said.

Selecting patients with realistic expectations is key with aDBS, Gostkowski emphasized. Older patients and those with preexisting gait and speech problems are at a greater risk for stimulation-induced side effects, said Martijn Beudel, MD, PhD, neurologist and associate professor at Amsterdam University Medical Center (UMC) in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

In addition, patients with significant cognitive impairment or dementia are typically ineligible because the surgery itself may pose risks. Nonmotor symptoms of PD — such as swallowing difficulties, drooling, or blood pressure regulation — are not improved with this technology.

Some patients hope for improvements in memory or freezing of gait, Gostkowski noted, but these symptoms are unlikely to respond, which can lead to confusion about what aDBS can, and cannot, achieve. 

Rand Laycock, a 70-year-old music conductor who had been using cDBS to treat his PD, was a good fit for aDBS, Gostkowski said. Since Laycock switched from cDBS to the adaptive system earlier this year, the impact has been profound.

“My tremor is almost all gone, except if I experience extreme anxiety or stress — and my dyskinesia is pretty well under control,” Laycock said in a Cleveland Clinic patient profile. “My symptoms are minimal compared to the way they were, and a lot of that is due to the adaptive deep brain stimulation.”

In fact, aDBS has enabled him to continue his 47-year career on the podium.

Clinical data reinforce such patient-reported outcomes. A recent study led by UCSF researchers showed that aDBS improved symptoms and quality of life in patients with PD while reducing common side effects of cDBS.

Patients like Laycock who transition to aDBS require no further surgery — the Medtronic's Percept DBS system can be updated via software to activate its adaptive setting.

Although patients with the Percept device installed can technically update to aDBS, that doesn't always mean they should.

“It takes a long time to set someone in an adaptive DBS mode, and the juice may not be worth the squeeze for many patients with well-placed DBS leads,” Michael Okun, MD, medical advisor for the Parkinson's Foundation and author of the book The Parkinson's Plan, told Medscape Medical News in an email.

Bronte-Stewart chimed a similar note. She cautioned against framing aDBS as a revolutionary alternative that patients must have. Rather, she said, it should be viewed as a personalized biological therapy vs an entirely new treatment.

Worldwide, more than 160,000 patients with PD have DBS implants, though it's unclear how many are using aDBS. However, Medtronic reports that to date, over 40,000 people globally have the Percept device.

“The exact number of clinics using aDBS is still small. The barriers for implementation include the need for clinician training, the complexity of programming, and insurance reimbursement hurdles,” Okun said.

In the US, the cost of DBS ranges from $70,000 to $100,000. Gostkowski and Brett Youngerman, MD, neurosurgeon and assistant professor of neurological surgery at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City, said that their patients with PD have had no issues getting insurance coverage for the treatment.

Across the pond in Netherlands, Beudel has been busy rolling out aDBS to his patients.

His team began using aDBS in routine clinical practice in 2021, initially through the ADAPT-PD trial, and has since expanded its use to roughly 20 patients this year.

He noted that patients currently require slightly more frequent hospital visits than those with cDBS, primarily for algorithm adjustments. However, in his experience, aDBS offers superior management of stimulation-induced side effects, including dysarthria, dyskinesia, and gait disturbances.

“We have the advantage that we stimulate less than with cDBS, so it's less prone for side effects. Of course, we need to be very cautious when titrating the aDBS algorithms because we need to make sure that the stimulation is switching on based on a physiological signal that correlates with the symptoms of the patient,” he told Medscape Medical News.

Given the recent rollout of this technology, Beudel stressed the importance of learning from other clinicians and establishing an international registry of centers using aDBS. So far, 26 centers across Europe, the US, and Japan have joined the consortium with the goal of sharing patient outcome data and clinical insights.

Another advantage of aDBS is its longer battery life. Because it doesn't stimulate the brain continuously, UCSF researchers found that it can conserve about 40% more power than cDBS. The battery requires monthly recharging but retains capacity for roughly 12 years — far outlasting most cell phones.

However, there are still key aspects of aDBS that experts believe need further refinement. “The main limitation right now is that it's limited to a single predefined biomarker primarily focused on beta power,” Youngerman, who also reported beneficial outcomes from aDBS among his 25 patients, told Medscape Medical News.

The current commercial device remains first generation, but future iterations are expected to incorporate more sophisticated algorithms capable of interpreting additional neural signals as scientific understanding advances, said Bronte-Stewart.

aDBS is also being explored as a potential treatment for other neurologic disorders and certain psychiatric conditions.

The next step for aDBS is greater integration of artificial intelligence (AI), which could make the system more autonomous and reduce hospital visits by allowing the stimulation to self-titrate, Beudel said.

Remote monitoring tools are also in development, potentially allowing clinicians to access a patient's aDBS data remotely and further reduce the need for clinic visits. Postmarket studies are planned, and early registries are being established, though results will likely take a year or more to emerge, Okun noted.

“The next-generation systems with AI-driven algorithms and better user interfaces are on the horizon. I'm excited. However, we must simplify programming and ensure broader access to make it a true game changer for Parkinson's care,” he said.

But for now, aDBS appears to be making a meaningful difference for patients with PD in the US and abroad. Gostkowski's patient Rand described the therapy as “a life-changing procedure that allows you to become your own self again.”

Youngerman and Gostkowski reported having no relevant financial disclosures. Beudel reported receiving research funding from the Amsterdam UMC TKI-PPP grant (2021 and 2023 call), the EU Joint Programme-Neurodegenerative Disease Research project (2021 call), Stichting ParkinsonFonds (2023 and 2025 call), and Medtronic (2023-2025), all paid to the institution. Bronte-Stewart and Okun reported having no relevant disclosures.

A study shows that people with higher levels of the protein albumin in their urine are at increased risk of developing dementia. The study, led by researchers at Karolinska Institutet, is published in the scientific journal Journal of Internal Medicine.

Although age remains the biggest risk factor for developing dementia, researchers have increasingly shown that diseases in other parts of the body, such as the kidneys, can also affect the brain.In the new study, the researchers were able to show that people with higher levels of albumin in their urine, an abnormal condition known as albuminuria (see fact box), are at increased risk of developing dementia later in life.This association was strongest for vascular dementia, the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, often caused by stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, or other vascular diseases, and for mixed dementia, which combines features of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.The study included 130,000 older adults in Stockholm, all over the age of 65 and free of dementia at the start of the study. During a follow-up period of approximately four years, seven percent of the participants developed dementia.After taking into account kidney function and other factors, the researchers found that people with moderate levels of the protein albumin in their urine (30-299 mg/g) had a 25 percent higher risk of developing dementia, while those with high levels (≥300 mg/g) had a 37 percent higher risk compared to people with normal levels (<30 mg/g).Higher levels of this protein indicate kidney damage and, according to this study, may also signal a higher risk of dementia.

The kidneys and the brain may seem like very different organs, but they share an important characteristic: both depend on a delicate network of small blood vessels. When the blood vessels in the kidneys are damaged, the same process often occurs in the brain."

Hong Xu, last author, assistant professor at the Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society at Karolinska Institutet

An important component is the blood-brain barrier, a protective layer that prevents harmful substances in the blood from entering the brain. Just as a damaged kidney filter leaks proteins into the urine, a damaged blood-brain barrier allows toxins and inflammatory molecules to the brain tissue. Over time, this increases the risk of vascular damage, inflammation, and accumulation of harmful proteins linked to dementia."These results underscore the importance of routine screening for albuminuria as part of early dementia risk assessment, especially in patients with high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or kidney disease. Early detection of albuminuria could potentially delay or prevent the onset of dementia," says Hong Xu.The study was funded by the Center for Innovative Medicine Foundation (CIMED), the Swedish Research Council, the U&L Angeby Foundation, the Petrus and Augusta Hedlund Foundation, and the Åke Wiberg Foundation, among others.

In the first study of its kind, scientists show that far-UV light can cut airborne allergen levels by a quarter in just half an hour, opening the door to safer breathing spaces for millions with asthma and allergies.

Study: Far UV Exposure (UV222) Decreases Immune-Based Recognition of Common Airborne Allergens. Image credit: Nor Gal/Shutterstock.com

Airborne allergens, or aeroallergens, can cause respiratory allergies and asthma. A recent study in ACS ES&T Air examined the impact of far-ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the immunogenicity of several common aeroallergens, hoping to find a preventative intervention.

One in three Americans suffers from allergies, and these conditions cause multiple severe illnesses worldwide. Airborne allergens, often occurring as indoor aerosols, are a significant cause of such allergies. They also trigger asthma, which affects 262 million people globally, with 1,000 deaths a day.

Common aeroallergens are proteins associated with dust mites, cats and dogs, mice, rats, fungi (e.g., Aspergillus), and plants. In most cases, they trigger an immune response that causes allergic reactions, though non-proteins are sometimes involved.

Specific regions of the protein's three-dimensional structure form recognition and binding sites to which immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies attach, setting off the inflammatory-allergic cascade. These regions are termed epitopes.

Current control strategies include preventive measures, medication, and engineering adaptations. Aeroallergens are, however, unique in their ability to persist indoors for years. There are no standardized methods to detect and monitor them to understand exposure-response relationships or the effectiveness of preventive measures. As a result, researchers often rely on indirect indicators, such as mold spore or pollen counts, instead of measuring the allergens themselves. Alternatively, settled dust is tested rather than airborne dust.

Therefore, our understanding of real-world exposure is limited, as in plants that make latex gloves, laboratories that use animals, plants that produce detergent enzymes, or those that process grain. These may expose workers to aeroallergen concentrations above 10 ng/m3, an allergy-inducing threshold.

Current preventive strategies are typically too intensive to be sustainable. Practical and multipronged interventions are needed to tackle allergens in the respired air and settle dust effectively.

The current study examines the effectiveness of UV at 222 nm bandwidth (UV222) in reducing aeroallergens. Conventional ultraviolet therapy uses the 254 nm band, which is genotoxic and thus destroys microbes. However, this can damage the human eyes and skin and is not suitable for lived-in spaces without extensive protection.

Conversely, UV222 inactivates microbes. It is highly absorbed by proteins, causing photooxidation and structural damage. However, its limited penetration power makes it safer on the skin and eyes. The current study targets using far-ultraviolet light UV222 as an occupant-safe treatment to reduce aeroallergens.

The researchers developed a controlled chamber model containing 10 m3 of air. They generated airborne allergens within the chamber using those commonly linked to patient sensitization, allergy, and asthma. The chamber was set to a relative humidity of 60% since allergens derived from mold and dust mites thrive in such an environment.

The allergens used included:

Aeroallergens were introduced from either dustborne or purified sources. The aeroallergen-bearing particles in the air were then collected and measured. The particle size distribution was also checked for allergen enrichment at any fraction.  

UV222 exposure of the whole chamber was provided. Still, it was set below the threshold for skin and eye exposure, as per the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) standards. Ozone levels generated by the radiation were also monitored.

As expected, over 99% of aeroallergens in the experimental chamber were 10 µm or smaller. No single allergen was concentrated within any particle size range. Interestingly, some aeroallergens were more stable in the air than others, likely due to intramolecular interactions and interactions with the surrounding environment. Future research should examine how this stability influences the risk of inhalation.

Allergen levels at baseline were about 50-200 ng/m3 in the controls and the UV chamber, reflecting clinically observed respirable air allergen levels. UV222 irradiation significantly reduced the average aeroallergen load by 20% to 25%. Most of the reduction occurred within 30 minutes of treating the air.

Comparing all aeroallergens, dustborne allergens decreased faster, on average, than airborne ones, after UV222 treatment. The most significant reduction was seen with the birch allergen Bet v 1. The least affected was Fel d 1, from dustborne and purified sources. However, it became much more vulnerable to UV222 after stabilizing components like Tween-20 were removed from the purified airborne form.

The finding of borderline significant ozone exposure levels indicates the need for ozone monitoring during ultraviolet irradiation in confined conditions. However, the ozone generated during the experiment did not significantly reduce allergen levels.

Not only did clinically relevant reductions in aeroallergen loads occur, but they occurred within feasible time periods. Regarding allergen decrease, the reductions are comparable to those reported in long-term allergy studies, though the paper stresses that clinical outcomes were not directly tested here.

The authors interpret these results cautiously, suggesting that UV222 likely disrupts protein structure and reduces immunoassay detection of allergens, which may also reduce IgE-epitope recognition in the body, but this requires further study.

This is the first study to use common aeroallergens in a controlled setting at concentrations similar to real-world allergy-causing levels in the air. These new methods should help understand airborne allergens' movement and availability in respired air. They could thus help in framing effective interventions and preventive measures.

“These findings suggest that UV222 exposure can reduce allergen immunorecognition within respirable particles, supporting its use as an integrated strategy for indoor aeroallergen control.” Further research is required to understand how this is associated with a clinically relevant reduction in symptoms in sensitized or allergic individuals.

The Family Heart Foundation, a leading research and advocacy organization, announced the online publication of recommendations from a multidisciplinary panel in the Journal of Pediatrics to promote the early identification of children living with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). A common life-threatening genetic condition that causes high cholesterol from birth, FH can lead to premature heart attacks and heart disease, if it is not diagnosed until adulthood. Despite national guidelines established in 2011 by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the prevalence of pediatric universal lipid screening remains low, leaving the majority of affected children in the United States at high risk of heart disease decades earlier than those who have not inherited the condition.

The manuscript, titled "Accelerating Guideline Recommended Universal Pediatric Lipid Screening: Launch of the LEAD Pediatric Initiative," highlights strategies that could lead to improved universal guideline-recommended screening implementation. The Family Heart Foundation established the Leveraging Evidence and Data (LEAD) for Pediatric Cholesterol Screening Initiative last year to address current challenges that serve as friction points in providing life-saving screening. The Family Heart Foundation engaged national experts and leveraged feedback from the FH population in the U.S. to identify barriers and develop evidence-based recommendations to improve universal lipid screening outcomes from the perspectives of patients/families, clinicians, and healthcare systems.

Every child in America between the ages of 9 and 11 years of age should get a simple blood test to screen their LDL cholesterol for a serious genetic condition called familial hypercholesterolemia. Many times, families do not understand that the cardiovascular disease that runs through their family for generations can be managed with early diagnosis. The publication in the Journal of Pediatrics lays out concrete actions that can be taken, and on which we have formed partnerships to support families and improve care for children."

Katherine Wilemon, founder and chief executive officer of the Family Heart Foundation

Data published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and in Pediatrics, indicates that only 11% of youth in the U.S. between the ages of 9 and 21 had documented lipid screening, and 30 to 60% of youth with dyslipidemia may be missed by targeted screening alone compared to universal lipid screening.

"Many clinicians do not understand the reason for pediatric lipid screening guidelines that were primarily developed to identify FH, a genetic condition designated by the World Health Organization in 1998 as a public health concern," said Laurence S. Sperling, MD, FACC, FACP, FAHA, MASPC, chief medical officer of the Family Heart Foundation, Katz professor in Preventive Cardiology at Emory University School of Medicine, and professor of Global Health at Rollins School of Public Health. "Early and aggressive cardiovascular disease can be prevented with an FH diagnosis in a child, leading to immediate and appropriate treatment. The goal of LEAD is to significantly impact missed opportunities to save hundreds of thousands of young lives from being cut short or burdened by early cardiovascular disease. The tools created by a working group representing patient, families, clinicians, and health systems as part of the Family Heart Foundation's LEAD initiative and outlined in the Journal of Pediatrics will increase understanding among clinicians and parents about the importance of universal screening."

The journal publication was simultaneously highlighted at the annual Family Heart Foundation Global Summit in Atlanta, in which the findings were shared with medical experts, policy makers, and industry leaders from around the world.

The trillions of microbes that live in the human gut may play a bigger role in health than previously thought, according to a new research by the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. The article, published in September 2025 in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, explores how gut bacteria interact with human genes in ways that could shape disease risk, aging and even future medical treatments.

The review highlights how the gut microbiome (the collection of bacteria, viruses and fungi that live in the digestive system) can affect epigenetics, the process that turns genes on or off without changing the DNA itself. These changes happen through chemical tags such as DNA or RNA methylation, which control when and how genes are expressed.

By understanding how gut microbes influence our genes, we can begin to imagine new ways to prevent disease and promote health in a way that gets us closer to personalized medicine."

Alika K. Maunakea, co-author of the study and professor, UH Mānoa John A. Burns School of Medicine

Everyday factors-such as diet, stress, medications and aging-can influence these microbial interactions. For example, gut bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids, nutrients and other chemical signals that may reprogram gene activity linked to immunity, metabolism or brain health. In turn, a person's lifestyle and genetic makeup can shape which microbes thrive in the gut, creating a feedback loop between humans and their microbes.

The researchers point to future possibilities where understanding this loop could help doctors design personalized treatments. Potential applications include using microbial biomarkers (biological signals that indicate health or disease), developing "live biotherapeutics" (beneficial bacteria given like medicine) or refining fecal microbiota transplants, which transfer gut microbes from healthy donors to patients. Advances in artificial intelligence and single-cell analysis are helping scientists model these complex relationships at an unprecedented scale.

The paper also stresses the importance of setting clear standards and ethical safeguards as this field develops. Frameworks such as the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable data) and CARE principles (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility and Ethics) are needed to ensure that data from microbiome research benefits diverse populations equitably.

By mapping out how gut microbes communicate with human genes, the review underscores both the promise and responsibility of this emerging science. The insights could open the door to precision health strategies that tailor prevention and treatment to each individual's unique microbial and epigenetic makeup.

Researchers from USC and Duke report that the persistent "know-do gap" - where clinicians know guidelines but practice differently - is the primary driver of antibiotic overprescribing for pediatric diarrhea in India's private sector, not lack of knowledge, point-of-sale profits, or stockouts of clinically recommended treatments such as oral rehydration salts (ORS).

In a sample of 2,282 private providers across 253 towns, 70 percent prescribed antibiotics without signs of bacterial infection, and among those who knew antibiotics were inappropriate, 62 percent still prescribed them to standardized patients, indicating a large know-do gap. The study found that eliminating the knowledge gap alone would cut inappropriate antibiotic use by about 6 percentage points, whereas closing the know-do gap could reduce it by roughly 30 percentage points.

Randomized experiments showed that the know-do gap was driven by providers' beliefs about patient preferences and not profits from selling antibiotics or limited supplies of ORS. When patients expressed a preference for ORS, inappropriate antibiotic use fell by 17 percentage points on average, with especially large reductions among pharmacies. By contrast, removing point-of-sale financial incentives and supplying ORS had no meaningful effect on antibiotic prescribing.

A discrete choice experiment with 1,189 caregivers further found that patients did not prefer providers who give antibiotics over those who provide ORS, underscoring the misalignment between provider perceptions and actual patient preferences.

Our data reveal a striking disconnect: clinicians know antibiotics are wrong for most diarrhea cases, yet prescribe them anyway because they think parents expect 'strong' medicines. Correcting that perception, rather than another training seminar, offers the biggest win for global antibiotic stewardship."

Zachary Wagner, corresponding author of USC's Center for Economic and Social Research

"A lot of children are given antibiotics when they don't need them, and that can lead to drug-resistant bacteria - a problem for the whole world, not just India. By showing that patient–provider communication trumps financial motives, we give policymakers a laser-focused lever: help doctors understand real patient preferences," added coauthor Neeraj Sood of the USC Schaeffer Center and Price School.

The authors note the largest know-do gaps among less formally trained providers and pharmacies, where preference signaling by patients yielded the biggest improvements, suggesting targeted interventions could deliver outsized benefits.

"Pharmacies and informal providers, often the first stop for care, showed the largest know-do gaps," noted Manoj Mohanan of Duke University. "Interventions that empower caregivers to voice a preference for ORS, or public campaigns signaling that parents don't demand antibiotics, could slash misuse at scale."

Funding for this research was provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (PI Wagner; 5R01DK126049).

Expanding access to lifestyle medicine education opportunities-such as continuing medical education (CME) courses, professional certification, webinars, mentoring and peer-to-peer connections, and conference participation-can facilitate the adoption of the medical specialty across health systems, according to a new study published in Translational Behavioral Medicine.

This qualitative study conducted by the American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) found that intentional educational strategies are critical to the adoption and growth of lifestyle medicine programming and facilitate deepening of clinicians' knowledge, skills, and confidence in delivering lifestyle medicine interventions to treat, reverse and prevent chronic disease.

These findings give health system leaders a roadmap of educational strategies to advance lifestyle medicine implementation. By investing in CME courses and conferences or creating space for informal activities like wellness programs and peer support, leaders have powerful levers that drive adoption and sustain long-term growth."

Micaela Karlsen, PhD, ACLM Senior Director of Research 

To understand how health systems prepare clinicians to practice lifestyle medicine, researchers conducted more than 60 interviews with clinicians, administrators and educators at eight health systems. Seven of these health systems are part of ACLM's Health System Council-a collaborative network dedicated to accelerating clinical integration of the specialty.

Interviewees identified several educational strategies that supported lifestyle medicine practice, including:

Interviewees described how educational initiatives translated into cultural and practice shifts within their organizations, also leading to mentoring and further peer support. The role of cultural support had been further explored in a previous ACLM study. One physician in the new study responded that after they earned lifestyle medicine certification, they "helped 15 other people, a few physicians and nurse practitioners" get board certified." At least two health systems established resources to support employees to achieve certification. 

Six health systems described leveraging lifestyle medicine and food as medicine conference attendance to support clinician education. Interviewees noted that the experience not only instilled a passion for lifestyle medicine but also inspired them to disseminate knowledge and insights within their organizations.

The study highlighted the benefit of embedding lifestyle medicine into employee wellness initiatives. These initiatives gave clinicians firsthand experience with the same lifestyle interventions recommended for patients, reinforcing both their confidence and credibility when delivering lifestyle medicine care. While pilot programs have long been recognized as an approach to test the feasibility of an intervention, the study's first author Meghan Ames, DrPH, MSPH, RDN, said "This work highlights that delivering lifestyle medicine to health system employees can serve as a rich opportunity for healthcare professionals to learn firsthand what lifestyle medicine is and how powerful it can be to impact health."

The study also pinpointed key educational content areas considered most critical: a clear definition and evidence base for lifestyle medicine, behavior change counseling, familiarity with lifestyle medicine referral opportunities and business operation skills.

Many of the strategies interviewees described focused on raising awareness of the lifestyle medicine resources available both inside and outside their health systems. This awareness was seen as critical for making patient referrals and ensuring consistent use of lifestyle medicine services. As one physician explained, "It's also important that the people you work with know about what existing resources are," adding that education must be continuous because "you'll always have new staff or new physicians joining."

New research presented at the 41st Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS 2025) demonstrates that ocrelizumab provides superior control of multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses compared with fingolimod, natalizumab, and alemtuzumab.

Ocrelizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20+ B cells, was evaluated using real-world data from three large MS registries: MSBase, OFSEP, and the Danish MS Registry. The analysis compared ocrelizumab-treated patients with cohorts receiving fingolimod (2,600 vs. 4,103 patients), natalizumab (3,197 vs. 2,437 patients), and alemtuzumab (2,960 vs. 644 patients), all with at least six months of treatment and follow-up.

In the fingolimod comparison, MS relapse rates were significantly lower with ocrelizumab (0.06 vs 0.14; p<0.001). Fingolimod patients had a more than twice the risk of relapse (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.98–2.58), a higher risk of relapse-associated worsening, and a lower likelihood of disability improvement.

Compared with natalizumab and alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab also showed lower relapse rates (0.07 vs 0.10 and 0.12 vs 0.18, respectively; both p<0.001). Additionally, ocrelizumab reduced the risk of relapse-associated worsening compared with natalizumab, while no such difference was observed compared with alemtuzumab.

While the differences between ocrelizumab and natalizumab or alemtuzumab were statistically significant, they were modest. For example, there was approximately one fewer relapse per 33 patient-years when comparing natalizumab to ocrelizumab. These differences were most pronounced in patients with recent disease activity, prior treatment failure, or those not treatment naïve."

Dr. Izanne Roos, lead author of the study

Adverse event data were not consistently available across registries. As a proxy for tolerability, the study examined treatment persistence. Only 8% of natalizumab patients and 6% of ocrelizumab patients discontinued treatment due to poor tolerability, suggesting both therapies are generally well-tolerated.

While ocrelizumab consistently reduced relapses and relapse-associated worsening, there was no evidence of differences in progression independent of relapse activity or disability improvement compared with the other high-efficacy therapies.

"These findings suggest we may have reached the ceiling of disability benefit achievable via relapse suppression alone, highlighting the urgent need for treatments that target relapse-independent progression," Dr. Roos concluded.

One day, bottles of probiotics might do more than keep you regular -- they could help prevent disease. To get there, a $2 million grant to UC Riverside will explore how gut bacteria shape human health.

Beyond your DNA and your lifestyle, your microbes play a huge role in shaping how your body reacts to illnesses and vaccines."

Ansel Hsiao, associate professor in UCR's Department of Microbiology and Plant Pathology and principal investigator of the grant

The award from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) will support Hsiao's lab in its quest to answer questions about how gut microbes communicate with each other and with their human hosts to influence health, or lack thereof. 

Probiotics currently sold in markets can have beneficial effects on regularity and bloating. However, their effects are limited, in part because they don't last long in the gut. 

"Though commercial probiotics are regarded as safe, they do not make people resilient to disease," Hsiao said. "They stick around for a day, maybe two. So, their beneficial effects rely on regular consumption."

With a better understanding of microbes' communication and behavior, Hsiao hopes his lab will one day create the next generation of probiotics and prebiotics that strengthen the gut microbiome, improve the effectiveness of vaccines, and prevent or lessen the severity of infections.

"One thing we can improve on with changing the gut microbiome, is making positive changes that last for extended periods of time," Hsiao said.

Bacteria are individual cells that operate independently, but they can produce chemical signals that other cells can sense, and that might influence the behavior of another bacterial cell. This is called quorum sensing, which is the idea that you can have many individuals cooperating on a single goal. 

"It's like a company that requires a certain number of people to conduct a meeting. You have to have a quorum for the meeting to proceed," Hsiao said. "Same idea with bacteria."

When many bacteria in the same host are making enough communication molecules, the whole population of individuals can behave almost like a multi-cellular organism. Some pathogenic bacteria, like the diarrheal disease cholera, use this type of communication to coordinate their activity and optimize their interactions with the host during infection. When it's multiplied to a high enough level, cholera bacteria signal to one another that it's time to move on to a new host.

In collaboration with clinical teams in Bangladesh, Hsiao's lab is also identifying bacterial profiles that correlate with stronger or weaker vaccine responses for diseases like cholera. By sequencing the gut bacteria present when a person is vaccinated, the team is beginning to predict who naturally develops immunity and who may need additional protection.

Though the cholera research is funded separately, the work could help explain why a cholera vaccine that's 99% effective in the U.S. drops to about 50% effectiveness in parts of South Asia. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that connect gut bacteria with each other and to the host's immune responses could extend the work from cholera to other diseases as well.

To probe these links under controlled conditions, Hsiao's team uses germ-free mice. These animals are raised without any bacteria or fungi. By introducing specific microbes, researchers can connect specific microbes to specific health outcomes.

"It's a powerful setup," Hsiao said. "We can see how a vaccine or disease-causing microbe performs when the gut contains only one bacterial species, or when it resembles a real human microbiome."

Some microbial differences are shaped by family or early-life exposure, but others come down to timing. The first bacteria to colonize a person's guts can determine whether new species are welcomed or excluded, a dynamic known as the priority effect. This level of variability makes standardized medical approaches more complicated. Even a widely used probiotic strain might benefit one person but do nothing for another.

The recent NIH grant enables long-term investigations into how individualized microbial ecosystems affect health, not just in response to vaccines, but in other areas including cognition, nutrition, and diarrheal infection.

"This kind of support is not tied to one project but to the broader questions we're pursuing," Hsiao said. "And the questions are urgent. If we can understand how to work with the microbiome instead of against it, we can transform public health."

Natural systems such as CRISPR-associated transposons (CASTs) offer a targetable, one-step way to edit genomes. However, adapting them for biomedical applications has been challenging. To address this limitation, scientists at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital designed a screening approach to measure efficiency and specificity for thousands of CAST variants accurately. This high-throughput approach allowed the researchers to rapidly optimize promising candidate CASTs, uncovering mechanistic insights fundamental for further engineering and potential clinical use. The findings were published today in Nucleic Acid Research.

Discovered in 2017, CASTs integrate large pieces of DNA into the genome at locations defined by a given RNA sequence. They are highly specific in bacteria, their natural host, but they do not work as well in human cells. 

For this reason, corresponding author Elizabeth Kellogg, PhD, St. Jude Department of Structural Biology, is keenly interested in engineering CASTs to be more applicable to humans and other organisms. To do so requires a quick way to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of engineered CASTs. 

One major gap in understanding CASTs was not just measuring their overall activity, but also how accurately they integrate DNA at the intended locations. There simply wasn't a scalable way to characterize their specificity."

Elizabeth Kellogg, PhD, St. Jude Department of Structural Biology

To address this gap, the researchers devised a high-throughput screen to measure the relative activity and specificity of thousands of CAST variants in a single experiment. By focusing on a single subtype - the V-K CAST, which is notably less complex than others - they were able to make slight alterations to its proteins and rapidly screen the mutants. 

"We wanted to screen a library with every possible single mutation to explore the mutational landscape of a CAST system," said co-first author Seong Guk Park, PhD, Department of Structural Biology. "We didn't focus on specific regions; instead, we tested them all to find mutations that could improve activity or specificity."

After the V-K CAST mutational screening, the researchers combined several of the most promising mutations to see if their positive effect was additive. "With just a few mutations, activity increased fivefold," Kellogg said. "We improved both specificity and activity without compromising either, which was not possible with previous strategies." 

Kellogg will continue working to improve the CAST design. With this screen now available, she is optimistic. "The natural system is very complicated, so we need to develop more minimal systems," Kellogg said. "But this screen now enables us to be more ambitious with our protein design so that we can ultimately achieve this goal."

The study's other first author is Jung-Un Park, University of California Berkeley and St. Jude. The study's other authors are Esteban Dodero-Rojas, John Bryant Jr., and Geetha Sankaranarayanan, St. Jude.

Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, part of University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, will co-lead a newly funded, multi-institutional clinical trial to evaluate whether artificial intelligence (AI) can help support radiologists in interpreting mammograms more accurately, with the goal of improving breast cancer screening and reducing unnecessary callbacks and anxiety for patients.

The study, known as the PRISM Trial (Pragmatic Randomized Trial of Artificial Intelligence for Screening Mammography), is supported by a $16 million award from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). The study will involve hundreds of thousands of mammograms interpreted at academic medical centers and breast imaging facilities in California, Florida, Massachusetts, Washington and Wisconsin. The AI support tool studied will be Transpara by ScreenPoint Medical with clinical workflow integration provided by the Aidoc aiOS platform.

As the first major randomized trial of AI in breast cancer screening in the U.S., this study represents a pivotal step. Our goal is to rigorously and objectively assess AI's impact - identifying who benefits and who may not. Radiologists remain firmly in control of all diagnostic decisions."

Jose Net, M.D., director of breast imaging services at Sylvester, associate professor of clinical radiology at the Miller School and co-principal investigator of the study

Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer death among women in the U.S. While routine mammography screening reduces mortality through early detection, it also has drawbacks - including false positives that can lead to unnecessary testing, anxiety and costs, and missed cancers.

"While AI offers substantial promise, it also prompts critical questions," said Net. "Our focus is on understanding whether AI genuinely enhances cancer detection by radiologists or simply leads to more false alarms."

What makes PRISM different is its emphasis on patient-centered research. The trial was developed in close partnership with patient advocates, clinicians, health system leaders and policymakers.

Each participating facility will continue routine screening as usual, with no changes to the patient experience. Mammograms will be randomly assigned to be interpreted either by a radiologist on their own or with assistance from an FDA-cleared AI support tool. In all cases, a radiologist reads the exam and makes the final decision.

"A trial of this magnitude focusing on AI in breast cancer screening has never been conducted in the U.S.," stated Net. "The findings will influence not only clinical practices but also insurance policies, technology integration, and patient interactions. According to Net, while there is significant optimism that AI will enhance health care, few rigorous studies have assessed its actual impact in real-world settings.

"This trial presents an opportunity to produce reliable evidence with a strong emphasis on the patient's perspective," he stated.

In addition to analyzing cancer detection and recall rates, the study will include focus groups and surveys to capture how patients and radiologists perceive and trust AI-assisted care.

The PRISM trial brings together seven leading academic medical centers:

Net emphasized that the goal is not to replace human expertise but to understand how AI might complement it. "Our skilled radiologists will always have the final say. While AI can serve as a helpful assistant, it is ultimately the radiologist who is in control."

The trial is expected to inform future policy decisions, best practices in screening, and how to most effectively integrate emerging technologies into patient care.

...

Seven games into the new season, Chelsea are not where they would want to be.

The Blues sit sixth in the Premier League table, having won just two of their opening five league games.

But why has the start to the season been worse than many would have expected? Can it all be blamed on the Club World Cup, or is there more to it?

Chelsea were one of only two Premier League clubs, alongside Manchester City, who were present at FIFA's revamped Club Wold Cup tournament in the USA over the summer.

It meant that while the other 18 Premier League clubs, including the Blues' competitors such as Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham were able to have at least six weeks off, Enzo Maresca and his players were only able to take two weeks off after the tournament, and only returned to training a couple of weeks before the Premier League started.

They did, of course, win the tournament, beating PSG 3-0 in style, which would have gone some way to making up for the burden of the event, but the physical strain on the players cannot be underestimated.

That strain has been shown by Chelsea's early injuries.

Levi Colwill picked up an ACL injury only days after Chelsea began training for the new season. The English centre-half played 38 games for Chelsea last term, then flew out with England for a camp and two games, before going straight to the FIFA tournament and playing five games there.

Cole Palmer, Chelsea's best and most important player, has had issues with a groin injury since the season began. The forward started the opening league game against Crystal Palace, before missing two games and returning against Brentford. He played in that game and against Bayern Munich in the Champions League, but was taken off after 20 minutes against Manchester United because of the persistent problem.

Palmer played 52 times for Chelsea last campaign, including the Club World Cup. It cannot be purely coincidental that Colwill and Palmer – two players who played among the most minutes in the squad – have now picked up serious injuries.

Colwill is Chelsea's best centre-back and a huge defensive miss, but if Palmer is to miss large parts of the season he is almost irreplaceable. He scored 18 goals and registered 13 assists last term.

And it's not just those two. Dario Essugo, Benoit Badiashile, Romeo Lavia and Liam Delap are all players who played in the summer tournament and now find themselves injured.

Despite clear issues that have arisen as a result of the heavy workload on the players, not all of Chelsea's shortcomings can be attributed to that.

On paper, the Blues had a very favourable start to the season. Crystal Palace, West Ham, Fulham and Brentford as the first four league games.

To take eight points from those games is a disappointment. Chelsea would have expected to beat Palace at home, and they would also expect to beat 17th place Brentford, who have lost their two best players and their manager.

It's not only the results that were disappointing but the performances were too. Chelsea were lacklustre against Palace, could and perhaps should have gone behind against Fulham, and were sloppy and defensively poor against Brentford.

The Brentford game was four days before Chelsea's trip to the Allianz Arena, and Enzo Maresca opted for an experimental side. Jamie Gittens and Facundo Buonanotte started, whilst Jorrel Hato debuted in defence, and looked overwhelmed.

The game required the late substitutions of Palmer and Alejandro Garnacho to see Chelsea score twice, and they still conceded in the last minute.

Fans were curious as to why Maresca chose to give two players their full debuts, Buonanotte and Hato, a decision which backfired.

And things seem to have gone downhill since that last minute equaliser that Brentford's Fabio Carvalho inflicted on them.

They were well beaten against Bayern Munich before disaster struck against Manchester United.

Robert Sanchez's daft decision to take out Bryan Mbeumo in the fifth minute and reduce the Blues to ten men was costly, but so were Maresca's ensuing decisions.

The Italian made three substitutions immediately following the red card. Palmer was an enforced one, but Estevao and Pedro Neto were also taken off. Three forward players left the pitch, and no forward players came on, leaving only one attacker, Joao Pedro, on the pitch.

Fans were baffled at Maresca's defensive substitutions, and United scored twice before the end of the first half anyway. Chelsea eventually got one back in the 80th minute, but it was too little, too late.

Maresca said after the game: “All the game changed after the red card, all the planning and everything, it doesn't exist anymore.”

While that might be true, part of a manager's job is to be reactive to in-game events. Those quotes, and Maresca's substitutions, were concerning.

After three games without a win and in need of some positivity, a Carabao Cup game against League One side Lincoln City seemed timely.

Maresca fielded a fairly strong side with several regulars starting. Chelsea prevailed 2-1, but Lincoln were the better team in the first half and went ahead in the game. It took a brilliant strike from George and a first goal from Buonanotte for the Blues to avoid a Manchester United v Grimsby style embarrassment.

Chelsea's transfer strategy is something that predates Maresca and was implemented when Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital took control of the club in May 2022.

The ownership and sporting directors have always had a youth-led approach in the transfer market, aiming to sign the best young talent from around the world before they become renowned stars.

The strategy made sense in the early years. Chelsea had an ageing squad and players like Jorginho, Cesar Azpilicueta, Antonio Rudiger and many others needed replacing.

There was also a period of grace for the new owners and sporting directors. They had to get their feet under the table and work things out.

Failed transfers like Mykhailo Mudryk, Joao Felix, Axel Disasi, Badiashile and others were to be anticipated. But with investment comes expectation.

Now the ownership have been in place for three years and spent £1.5 billion. So rightly, the expectations for the club have increased. While they have had some success, winning the Conference League, Club World Cup and qualifying for the Champions League last season, fans expect a Premier League title challenging team. Not necessarily title winning, but title challenging.

Chelsea made some questionable decisions this summer. Letting go of Noni Madueke and signing Gittens and Garnacho does not appear an improvement.

Hato may become a brilliant defender. But he is not currently, and so does not make a massive impact on Chelsea's hopes in the immediate future.

After Colwill got injured, Maresca emphasised the need for a new centre-back signing. There was still almost a month left of the window but nothing was done.

So is it any surprise that with mounting injuries and young players such as Gittens and Hato who do not seem ready, as yet, for the top level of the Premier League, Chelsea are having a mixed season so far?

Maresca will no doubt to continue to carefully manage his squad to try to avoid injuries, but he must hope his young signings can quickly reach the level required if squad rotation is not to hamper the team too much.

Chelsea will have minimum expectations of qualifying for the knockout rounds of the Champions League and at the very least finishing in the top four. A domestic cup win would help matters but overall, there has to be clear signs of progress towards become a title contending team.

The transfer strategy has to change, that is clear. Chelsea need world-class players, not potentially world-class players. But they may have to endure an underwhelming season before they get another go at improving.

President met South American powerbrokers in NYC

World body would face opposition to 64-team plan

Fifa is not planning to expand the men's World Cup to 64 teams for the centenary edition of the tournament in 2030, despite its president, Gianni Infantino, meeting a delegation of South America leaders to discuss the idea in New York.

Infantino met the Uruguay and Paraguay heads of state, the president of South American confederation, Conmebol, as well the presidents of the Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay federations at Fifa's offices in Trump Tower on Tuesday for the first formal discussions about a proposal that was raised informally by the Uruguayan Football Association at a Fifa Council meeting last March.

Fifa's official position is that it will discuss World Cup expansion with all its stakeholders and that it is duty-bound to consider proposals raised at council. But behind the scenes there is scepticism about whether expanding the tournament to 64 teams is a viable proposition. Next year's World Cup will be the first to contain 48 teams, while the governing body has broken with convention for 2030 by staging the tournament in six countries on three continents. Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina will host the first three matches in tribute to the competition's South American origins in 1930, before the bulk of the tournament moves to Morocco, Spain and Portugal.

Any decision to expand the World Cup would be taken by Fifa Council, which meets in Zurich next month, but that is not on the agenda.

“Gianni would not get that vote through Council even if he wanted to,” a Fifa source said. “The overwhelming feeling around the table – and not just in Europe – is that 64 teams would damage the World Cup. There'd be too many uncompetitive matches and it would risk damaging the business model.”

Conmebol would be the major beneficiaries of another expansion and sources with knowledge of Tuesday's meeting disclosed that Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina claimed to have the capability to host all of the group stage.

Expansion to 64 teams would mean more than 30% of Fifa's 211 member associations would take part, as well as putting all 10 Conmebol in the frame to qualify, up from six direct qualifiers next year, plus the possibility of an extra place via an inter-confederation playoff.

The 64-team idea was first presented at Fifa Council last April, but prompted an immediate backlash. The Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, described it as a “bad idea” that would reduce the quality of the tournament and undermine the qualifying competition. The Concacaf president, Victor Montagliani, said: “They [Fifa] can study all they want, but it just doesn't feel right.” Significantly, both men are Fifa vice-presidents.

Fifa is also facing calls from leading European clubs to expand the Club World Cup from 32 teams in 2029 due to the huge prize and appearance money on offer. Chelsea collected £85m for winning it in July. Staging the competition every two years is also being considered.

A 64-team World Cup would feature 128 matches, double the number played at the most recent tournament in Qatar three years ago and 24 more than next year. The World Cup has grown significantly in recent decades, increasing from 16 to 24 teams in 1982, growing again to 32 in 1998 before becoming a 48-team competition next summer.

Any decision to expand the World Cup would be taken by Fifa's Council, which meets in Zurich next month, although the issue is not thought to be on the agenda.

Fifa declined to comment.

In this story:

Chelsea have released the team's 2025/26 squad photo as they showcased the UEFA Conference League and FIFA Club World Cup trophies.

It has been a mixed start to the season for Chelsea, who are currently sixth in the Premier League table with two wins and a loss from their opening five games.

It is great, therefore, to see that there are plenty of smiles among the players in the squad photo, which the club shared on Wednesday.

Head coach Enzo Maresca sits in the middle, of course, alongside his primary assistant and former Chelsea goalkeeper Willy Caballero.

Next to these two coaches are captain Reece James and vice captain Enzo Fernandez, and in front of them, the two trophies the team won last season: the Conference League and the Club World Cup.

It is also great to see Levi Colwill, who is still recovering from a long-term anterior cruciate ligament injury, again.

When speaking recently about his squad and Chelsea's Premier League title hopes, Maresca insisted that his team has been improving and closing the gap to the leading teams.

"For me, this season, the main target is to continue to improve players, continue to improve the team and try to close that gap. This is, for me, the main focus for this season."

The Blues are still in contention to compete for four trophies this season, including the Carabao Cup, in which they have just reached the fourth round after beating Lincoln City on Tuesday.

While in the Champions League, Chelsea's return to the competition was unfortunately marked with a defeat to Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich. 

Maresca's men will be able to bounce back with a win as they host Benfica in the Champions League at Stamford Bridge next week. But before that, the next challenge is Brighton in a Premier League bout on Saturday.

Carlo Ancelotti has revealed that his dismissal by Bayern Munich was "worse" than the sackings he faced at Chelsea and Real Madrid. The Italian coach says it was a mistake against Paris Saint-Germain that saw him given his walking papers just a month into the 2017-18 season. The legendary manager reflected on the disappointing period in an upcoming autobiography.

Q2 Stadium opened its doors less than five years ago, and in a short time it's quickly become a special place for the U.S. Men's National Team. The USMNT is undefeated in Austin, Texas through six games — all of them shutouts. 

The National Team competes in venues across the world, but Austin is one of five cities in the country where the USMNT is unbeaten after at least five games played. AT&T Stadium, up the I-35 in Arlington, Texas holds the longest streak with seven. Both were recent stops in the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup where the United States made a run to the final.

The Americans return to the home of the Austin FC on Oct. 10 to face World Cup-qualified Ecuador at 8:30 p.m. ET in the build-up to the 2026 FIFA tournament next summer. This will be the second friendly, while the other five matches have been tournament games, including the Concacaf Gold Cup and Nations League as well as FIFA World Cup Qualifiers. The first friendly was head coach Mauricio Pochettino's first game — and win — in October 2024. 

It wasn't too long ago when the USMNT last took the field in the Texas capital. The USA took down Saudi Arabia 1-0 in a group stage match of the Gold Cup this past June. Defender Chris Richards earned Man of the Match honors as he scored his second international goal and made a key tackle to prevent a Saudi Arabia potential scoring opportunity. 

The six matches at Q2 have been electric. Three of the outings have been sellouts with a total average attendance of more than 18,000. The USMNT has given fans a lot to cheer for in Austin with 14 goals scored and none allowed. 

Striker Ricardo Pepi and forward Jesús Ferreira have accounted for eight of those goals, scoring four each. The forwards have deep ties to Texas as Pepi grew up in El Paso and Ferreira spent formative years in Dallas, and both came up through the FC Dallas Academy. Ferreira totaled that amount in one match in June 2022 against Grenada in the Nations League opener. The impressive four-goal match tied a USMNT record that only five players have touched. 

The United States will look to continue that winning legacy and go 7-0 in Austin. A victory over Ecuador would extend its win streak versus the CONMEBOL side to four, which would be the longest current streak against a South American opponent.

Q2 Stadium opened its doors less than five years ago, and in a short time it's quickly become a special place for the U.S. Men's National Team. The USMNT is undefeated in Austin, Texas through six games — all of them shutouts. 

The National Team competes in venues across the world, but Austin is one of five cities in the country where the USMNT is unbeaten after at least five games played. AT&T Stadium, up the I-35 in Arlington, Texas holds the longest streak with seven. Both were recent stops in the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup where the United States made a run to the final.

The Americans return to the home of the Austin FC on Oct. 10 to face World Cup-qualified Ecuador at 8:30 p.m. ET in the build-up to the 2026 FIFA tournament next summer. This will be the second friendly, while the other five matches have been tournament games, including the Concacaf Gold Cup and Nations League as well as FIFA World Cup Qualifiers. The first friendly was head coach Mauricio Pochettino's first game — and win — in October 2024.

Christopher Nkunku scored his first goal for AC Milan as the Rossoneri eased past Lecce 3-0 in the Coppa Italia. The French forward, who joined from Chelsea this summer, said he feels 'comfortable and determined' to succeed after putting injury struggles behind him and helping Milan reach the round of 16.

Alexi Lalas has dropped his usual line of relentlessly lambasting Christian Pulisic to go to the other extreme, hailing the American forward as the best player AC Milan currently boast.

Lalas is an infamously outspoken critic of all that involves the U.S. men's national team (USMNT). Back in 2017, the former international defender brandished Pulisic and his colleagues “a bunch of soft, underperforming, tattooed millionaires” and has maintained a steady stream of dissenting commentary over the subsequent years.

Much like his compatriots Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey, Lalas was unimpressed with Pulisic's decision to skip this summer's Gold Cup. The 27-year-old explained that he needed time off to recovery after a draining European campaign before gearing up for the 2026 World Cup which will be co-hosted by the U.S.

That rest has already paid off. Pulisic boasts five goals across Milan's first six games of the new campaign, taking his tally to 59 in Europe's top five leagues which is a new high among USMNT male players.

Lalas let the excitement of Pulisic's strong form get the better of him. Speaking in the aftermath of Milan's 3–0 win over Udinese, which saw a player Lalas once sarcastically derided as “Wonder Boy” bag a brace, the professional pundit declared: “I think you are looking at it certainly right now, and if you need any more proof, this game is it, that he is an elite player in Serie A. He is, I think arguably the best player for AC Milan.”

Pulisic is the only Milan player with more than one goal to his name this season although Rafael Leão, who has been struggling with injuries, would certainly challenge his claim to be the team's most important figure. Luka Modrić, the former Ballon d'Or holder and six-time Champions League winner, may also have something to say about Lalas's ranking.

Nevertheless, the excitable commentator would not be deterred. “This was a phenomenal game,” he continued. “I think something that he will remember and Pulisic fans, fans of the U.S. national team and AC Milan fans can appreciate, and I think we'll remember for a long time. Everything he touched seemed to turn to gold.

“So this was everything that Christian Pulisic is encapsulated into one game. And rightfully he is receiving the flowers that a performance like that and combined with I think a consistency now of quality and elite performances that was attributed to him.”

The FIFA World Cup 2026 is poised to be the largest of its kind, expanding from 32 teams to 48, with matches scheduled to be played across the North American continent. United 2026, the joint bid by the host nations, consists of the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

However, the sheer size of this football tournament casts a dark shadow on the environment, even threatening livelihoods. Sponsorship deals with fossil fuel companies, extensive air travel, suppression of protests from local communities, and construction on forests all set the 2026 iteration to be the one with the highest carbon footprint yet.

A new report by Scientists for Global Responsibility, “FIFA's Climate Blind Spot: The Men's World Cup in a Warming World,” finds that the expansion of the tournament from 32 to 48 teams will lead to a significant increase in emissions for the 2026, 2030, and 2034 iterations of the event — particularly due to air transport for teams, staff, and fans.

The report estimates that the World Cup will generate at least 9.0 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, the highest ever in the event's 95-year history. The Spanish-led 2030 iteration will lead to 6.1 million tCO2e, and the 2034 Finals in Saudi Arabia will be responsible for 8.6 million tCO2e.

FIFA has not had the best track record in staying aligned with climate strategies. In 2021, FIFA launched an initiative at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), pledging to reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by 2040.

But the credibility of FIFA's previous claims of carbon neutrality at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar has already been questioned by multiple groups. The Swiss Commission for Fairness, based in Zurich, also reported that the organization was “not able to provide proof that the claims were accurate” and “did not set out a plan to define how it will further offset emissions”.

FIFA's case becomes even more questionable considering notable sponsors of the event include airline and oil companies such as Qatar Airways and Aramco.

“How is it possible that they have a first-class stadium, and next to it, a town that's dead?”

While the event will use existing venues, instead of requiring the construction of newer ones, preparations and expansions continue to hurt local communities.

People living in areas surrounding the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City say development plans for the area will worsen the water supply and threaten green spaces.

“We have a right to constitution,” says Rubén Ramírez, a community leader in Santa Úrsula Coapa, a district in Mexico City. “They're ignoring us completely. We don't know anything.”

The constitution states that in the case of constructing on Indigenous land, authorities must legally consult local communities and leaders, such as Ramírez. However, their protests are being ignored as the government continues preparations for the World Cup.

There are even plans to turn a 5,000-square-meter forest area inside Santa Úrsula into a construction site.

“They can't take it, this is the lungs of the community,” says Ramírez. “Why do they have to build it here? Take it somewhere else.”

It is estimated that the World Cup will inject up to £5.2 billion into the country, locking the Mexican government's interests entirely.

The biggest issue, however, might be the water supply. Water shortages are a common issue across Mexico City, and the Azteca district is further threatened by the expansion of the stadium. Televisa, a company that partly owns the Azteca stadium, privatized a well in the area in 2018, further worsening the condition, as the Santa Úrsula community protests that this contract was illegal and has contributed to exploitation.

“The stadium is part of the community's territory,” says Ramírez. “It's the owners, the businesspeople who are going to benefit from the World Cup. What are the community going to see? Nothing.”

To counteract these effects, the report suggests that FIFA:

Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard has picked Alexis Mac Allister as his favourite midfielder over Declan Rice, Enzo Fernandez and even Ryan Gravenberch, but hailed Rodri as the king of the position. Mac Allister, who moved to Anfield from Brighton in 2023, established himself as a starter first under Jurgen Klopp and then retained his place once Arne Slot took charge last season.

Dembélé, the new king of football


The 2025 Ballon d'Or crowned Ousmane Dembélé as the best player in the world after a spectacular season with PSG. The Frenchman lifted the Champions League, Ligue 1, French Cup and French Super Cup, while scoring 35 goals and adding 16 assists. Numbers that finally established him as the undisputed leader he had long been expected to become. 





The vote confirmed what many anticipated: Dembélé's maturity placed him above everyone else, even one of the brightest young stars on the planet.

On the other side stood Lamine Yamal, the 18-year-old prodigy who dreamed of becoming the youngest Ballon d'Or winner in history. His silence after the ceremony reflected the blow of hearing Dembélé's name instead of his.





Although he was recognized with the 2025 Kopa Trophy as the world's best young player, Yamal had prepared a private celebration in Paris with family and friends that never came to be. His defeat left a bittersweet taste: a secure future, but still without the ultimate glory.


The Champions League twist


What the Ballon d'Or separated, the Champions League will bring back together. On October 1, Yamal's Barcelona will visit Dembélé's PSG in the second matchday of the continental tournament.

It will be a clash loaded with intrigue: the new Ballon d'Or holder against the player many believe is destined to dominate the next decade. Paris will once again set the stage for their story, only this time on the pitch, with the ball rolling and the chance to prove who truly deserves the throne.

A comeback full of symbolism


José Mourinho never leaves anyone indifferent. Just weeks after ending his spell at Fenerbahçe, the Portuguese coach is back where it all began: Benfica. The dismissal of Bruno Lage, following the Eagles' painful Champions League defeat to Qarabag, opened the door for The Special One to return to the Estádio da Luz.





The story has a curious, even controversial twist: it was Benfica who eliminated Fenerbahçe from the Champions League shortly before Mourinho's arrival. In Turkey, many view it as a hidden betrayal, while in Portugal, it feels like a circle being closed.


Closing the circle in Lisbon


Mourinho had already experienced a brief spell at Benfica back in 2000. It lasted just nine games, but it was the first step in a career that would take him to the very top of European football. From there, he moved to Porto, where he became a legend by winning two league titles, a UEFA Cup and the Champions League that changed his life.





That meteoric rise catapulted him to Chelsea, Inter, Real Madrid and Manchester United. Titles, controversies and unforgettable quotes made him an unrepeatable figure. In recent years, however, his trophy cabinet lost its shine: the Conference League with Roma and barren spells at Tottenham and Fenerbahçe were a far cry from the dominant Mourinho of another era.


Between betrayal and excitement


Returning to Benfica means more than coming home — it also means taking charge of Porto's eternal rival, the very club that made him a legend. It's reminiscent of what he experienced in Spain when he joined Real Madrid, knowing he would divide passions and fire up opposing fans.

In Lisbon, Mourinho is chasing what he has sought in recent years: a return to the elite, the joy of football, and another chapter of glory. This is his home, this is Portugal, and this is the Champions League — the stage where he has always felt most alive. And while some may call it betrayal, he sees it as another chance to be happy.

Alex Morgan is honored and has her No. 13 jersey retired by San Diego. (0:33)

DEL MAR, Calif. -- One year ago, after Alex Morgan announced to the world in a video that she was pregnant and retiring with almost immediate effect, she sat in her car alone and cried.

"I was like OK, it's out there. Now I'm going to enjoy it," she told ESPN in a sit-down interview.

Morgan's 15-year career -- which included two World Cup titles, an Olympic gold medal and multiple major club trophies -- ended abruptly, but she'd already been working for years on her next chapter to come in the world of business.

Morgan was the face of the U.S. women's national team and arguably the most famous female athlete globally for over a decade. She grew to such fame that she transcended the sport, signing deals with Coca-Cola and Nike, appearing in commercials with NBA star LeBron James and even receiving her own custom Barbie. Along the way, she observed how the business of sports operates, but also how it failed female athletes with minimal media coverage and low salaries ($6,000 was the minimum when the NWSL launched in 2013).

Now, Morgan is a minority investor in San Diego Wave FC, the last team she played for, along with other investments including the new 3-on-3 women's basketball league, Unrivaled. In 2019, in the prime of her career, she co-founded the content brand Togethxr with fellow athletes and Olympic gold medalists Sue Bird, Simone Manuel and Chloe Kim.

"I just realized that there are so many ways for athletes to carry on their business far past their playing career and to make a business of it, of their brand, far past their playing days," Morgan said. "That's what I've tried to set up the last five to eight years.

"And I think that's why I was so at peace with retiring from playing soccer, because I didn't retire and wake up the next day going, 'What's next?' I already had so many different things in motion -- it wasn't like figuring the next thing out as one door closed and the next door opened. I was juggling a lot of things at once and trying to learn a lot of new things off the field."

Morgan's hands-on experience at the highest level of sport is why other businesswomen have invested in her. Olivia Walton, the founder of Ingeborg Investments -- which focuses on women-led, early-stage startups -- met Morgan at a conference for women in venture capital. The two shared a vision "from the beginning," said Walton, who joined Togethxr as an investor earlier this year.

Morgan's achievements as a player were part of the selling point to Walton.

"Alex approaches business the same way she approaches competition -- with curiosity, intensity, and purpose," Walton told ESPN via email. "She sees opportunities others miss because she's lived the athlete's journey, and she brings an authenticity that's rare in this space."

Togethxr's primary business is branded studio content, including films focused on women athletes. The company said it was profitable last year and claimed it saw a large increase in revenue (to $30 million) and valuation.

"That 360-degree perspective is unmatched, and it makes her one of the most important voices shaping the future of the game," Walton said. "Few people can walk into a room and be listened to equally by players, sponsors, and investors like Alex can."

That is high praise for someone whose business experience has been, by Morgan's own admission, learning as she goes. Morgan studied political economics at Cal-Berkeley, but she was becoming a household name with the USWNT before she even graduated college -- where she "was very head down, driven to be the best soccer player I could possibly be."

Alex Morgan reacts to her first goal for the USWNT in a friendly vs. China.

These days, Morgan is busy beyond Togethxr. For one, she is now a mom of two, telling ESPN that she tries to find balance in simple ways like stepping out to take a walk.

Through Trybe Ventures, the investment arm she has with her husband, Servando Carrasco, she also has a stake in roughly two dozen companies ranging from media to sports technology. Among their other investments are the Los Angeles Golf Club in TGL, and Classic Football Shirts, a company focused on nostalgic soccer kits.

Dan Levy, who has been Morgan's agent since she first became a professional soccer player, said it's rare to find an athlete who can successfully navigate business ventures in the prime of their career.

"A lot of athletes struggle with trying to figure out how to manage their career and be the best at what they do on the field, on the court, and at the same time, put in the time, effort, and work to build their business outside of it," he told Variety recently.

Today, Morgan leans on those athlete experiences -- and the expertise of partners like Walton -- to sharpen herself as a businessperson.

"I'm learning in this new space every single day," Morgan said. "It's very humbling and it's also really challenging in a lot of ways -- in a good way, in the way that I was challenged on the soccer field every day. I feel like I rely on a lot of the skills that I learned in soccer, a lot of the personal character-building skills that I can apply to business."

Morgan made a quick transition from player to team owner for the Wave, retiring last September and joining the team as an investor in May.

Alex Morgan says never in her "wildest dreams" would she see San Diego Wave retire her. No. 13 jersey.

Last year, amid turmoil for the Wave on and off the field that included allegations from former employees of a toxic work environment, Morgan prominently spoke as an active player, tweeting "it is clear that there is so much work to be done." Since then, the team has fully transitioned ownership to the Levine Leichtman family and turned over its front office, including the December departure of former team president Jill Ellis, who along with the club denied allegations made by previous employees. (Ellis filed a defamation lawsuit, while the employees are suing the Wave and the NWSL.)

Asked what has changed with the club in just over a year and why she invested, Morgan said that one of the reasons she wanted to invest is to provide feedback from the perspective of a former player. She said she wants to provide mentorship to young players, several of whom on the Wave are teenagers. Twenty-four-year-old defender Kennedy Wesley said after the Wave retired Morgan's No. 13 jersey on Sept. 7 that she grew up with a poster of Morgan on her wall.

Morgan was more than just a great player who scored 123 international goals. She was a central figure in the USWNT's fight against the U.S. Soccer Federation for equal pay, which it achieved via settlement in 2022 after a six-year fight. She was also an active participant in the NWSL's collective bargaining negotiations, and one of the prominent voices in the fight against the NWSL's previous inaction against abuses.

Her public statements contributed to the firing of Paul Riley from the North Carolina Courage for alleged previous sexual misconduct with players, and to the ousting of former NWSL commissioner Lisa Baird for her handling of the complaints.

Morgan said the NWSL has significantly improved from "the leanest years" when it launched with her as a player in 2013, and from the league's recent overhaul following what multiple investigations revealed as "systemic" abuse.

Players have obtained more agency and workplace protection through the new CBA. One specific new policy Morgan pointed to is the ability to take paid mental health leave, as multiple players in the NWSL have done this year.

"That just didn't exist a couple of years ago," Morgan said. "I attempted to do that with the national team and then I was not called back in for six or seven months because of it, because of raising my hand and saying I need a break, I just had a baby, and I need to step away for this next camp. And then I wasn't invited back for six or seven months.

"Players now can do that without repercussion. Everyone needs a break at some point or another, whether it's in their second year or 15th year playing soccer, playing sports, in their job. The ability to be able to do that is something that's new and I feel like I've advocated for players to be able to be able to be the driving force of this league.

"There is no league without players, so let's treat them right, let's give them all the resources we could possibly do like with financial literacy, with mental stability, with family planning, whatever it may be. I have fought for those things both as a player and now as an owner."

Morgan has long known she has a large platform. Her voice has directly driven change in the NWSL and U.S. Soccer, and that hands-on approach remains. "She's not just lending her name -- she's in the meetings, driving ideas forward, and shaping the vision," Walton said. "That level of commitment is rare."

Morgan's commitment to growth is embodied by the slogan made famous by Togethxr: "Everyone Watches Women's Sports." It's a campaign increasingly plastered across apparel, but it's also statistically backed (even if slightly exaggerated) by rising media deals, attendance, and valuations across women's sports. Women's sports have become big business.

NWSL teams have increased from $2 million sales five years ago to a $250 million sale of Angel City FC last year. Transfer fees crossed the $1 million mark for the first time in January and the world record fell on multiple occasions since as teams invest more in players.

Morgan teased another forthcoming investment in women's sports "soon" when she spoke with ESPN. This is her new life, one that traded her boots for the boardroom and her foundation for equity in sports.

Morgan is learning day to day on the fly, but she knows one thing firsthand: "Listen, anyone who's smart is getting into investing in women's sports."

FILE - Members of the Afghan women's football team attend Morocco's practice ahead of the Women's World Cup in Melbourne, Australia, Wednesday, July 19, 2023.

ZURICH (AP) — The Afghanistan national women's soccer team of refugee players has its first official games next month at a four-team tournament in Dubai, FIFA said Wednesday.

The FIFA-supported team — which cannot yet officially represent Afghanistan in World Cup qualifying — will face the host United Arab Emirates, Chad and Libya in the Oct. 23-29 event.

Afghanistan has not played an official women's competitive game since 2018, and the return to power of the Taliban regime in 2021 shut down women's sport. The Afghan soccer federation has obligations under FIFA statutes to avoid discrimination though has not been suspended from international soccer.

The tournament “reinforces FIFA's efforts to promote and protect the right of all women and girls to play the sport, pursue their footballing dreams and thrive through the game,” the soccer body said.

The women's teams of Chad and Libya do not yet have a FIFA ranking, and the UAE is No. 117.

FIFA said all games at the round-robin tournament will be broadcast live on its in-house streaming platform.

The boy who gave Barcelona hope


When Ansu Fati made his debut for FC Barcelona in 2019, at just 16 years, 9 months, and 25 days old, he looked destined for greatness. A product of La Masía, he was seen as the heir to fill the void Lionel Messi would eventually leave. His flair, fearlessness, and goal-scoring instinct instantly made him the jewel Barcelona fans had been waiting for.





The club quickly secured him with a €400 million release clause in 2019, and by 2021 it was raised to €1 billion—right after he inherited Messi's legendary No. 10 shirt following the Argentine's move to PSG. What seemed like the start of a golden era soon turned into a nightmare.


The nightmare of injuries


In November 2020, Ansu suffered a torn meniscus in his left knee, an injury that required four surgeries and kept him sidelined for nearly a year. That was only the beginning of a downward spiral that pulled him away from the glorious path many thought was his destiny.

When he returned, he was no longer the same. His physical condition lagged, his confidence dipped, and under Xavi Hernández, he slipped from the bench to the stands. Eventually, Barcelona loaned him to Brighton in the Premier League, but the spark never came back.






Brighton struggles and a gray return to Barça


With the Seagulls, Ansu made 30 appearances across all competitions, but managed just 4 goals and 1 assist. His underwhelming stint brought him back to Barcelona carrying more doubts than answers.

Under Hansi Flick, things worsened: only 11 games played, totaling 298 minutes. A far cry from the expectations set for the player once seen as the face of Barça's future.


A new light in Monaco


Just when his career seemed to fade, AS Monaco opened a new door. His move in the latest transfer window has breathed fresh life into his journey. Though he took time to make his debut, he made an immediate impact: scoring in his Champions League debut against Club Brugge, and just three days later, netting a brace in his Ligue 1 debut versus Metz.

Football always offers second chances, and Ansu's might finally have arrived. It's too early to declare a full comeback, but the signs are promising. The football world would welcome the return of a player once hailed as Messi's heir—one who still has the potential to shine just as brightly as promised from the very start.

Women's Soccer

The Black Women's Player Collective (BWPC) will cohost a showcase in November aimed at identifying and nurturing young Black soccer talent, the organization announced Wednesday.

In partnership with Allstate and Black Star media, the Next Wave National Showcase will take place on the campus of Prairie View A&M, an historically Black college in Texas, from Nov. 22-25. Allstate provided the funding for the event, and Black Star will serve as the chief storyteller. The group will select 20-30 of the best Black high school soccer players in the country.

Between the elimination of the college draft and increased visibility of Black female soccer players succeeding at all levels of the game, the ability to properly scout and develop Black talent has become more critical. According to BWPC data, 3.8 per cent of NWSL players self-identified as Black during the 2020 season. That figure has since grown to 12 per cent for the 2025 season, while Black players make up nearly half of the U.S. women's national team.

“Black players have been historically underrepresented in this sport, and if you don't carve out space for us to exist in this community, then they'll be left behind,” North Carolina Courage forward Brianna Pinto, who serves on the board of the BWPC, told The Athletic before the announcement.

“It's incredibly important to the BWPC to make sure that we're creating a seat at the table for the next generation of Black athletes, and the way to do that is by making events specifically for them.”

The announcement comes one week after the NWSL announced it would host two combines for different age groups in December. One will be for players aged 13-17; the other for those 18-23, with an aim “to support NWSL clubs in early talent evaluation and provide players with exposure to a professional environment,” according to NWSL Director of Youth Development Karla Thompson.

Like the NWSL combine, the organizers of the Next Wave Showcase are yet to share their list of participating players. Pinto supports the expansion of opportunities for young players to show their skills in front of clubs, coaches, and agents, but emphasized the importance of showcasing Black talent.

“In this country, in a lot of social environments, Black people have been an afterthought and we want to celebrate our collective experience as minorities in this country because we have so much to share and so much to give and so much passion for the game,” she said. “I do believe that if we pour into our community, it will benefit the entire soccer landscape.”

Pinto said BWPC members will tap into their respective networks to nail down their invite list for the showcase. The itinerary will include “a lot of playing so that they can properly be evaluated,” Pinto said, adding the event would aim to “identify talent and push them to where they need to be.”

The BWPC and its partners were intentional about taking a holistic approach to the showcase, ensuring its messaging was aligned with its sporting ambitions. There will also be networking opportunities with coaches, scouts, and agents; and a media day for the players to gain experience interacting with the press.

Pinto said one detail that's garnered excitement among the BWPC is the inclusion of hair, makeup, and “off the field glam,” as she put it, to expose players to that side of professional sports.

In 2021, U.S. women's national team star Crystal Dunn spoke about the disappointment of walking into similar environments and being unable to work with hair and makeup artists who were trained to work with Black textured hair and darker complexions.

Pinto said the showcase will discuss nutrition and mental health with the players. She also hopes that it will “shift the landscape and give more attention to HBCU athletics programs.”

The showcase comes against the backdrop of the Trump administration targeting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs by withdrawing funding from initiatives, if not eliminating policies altogether. For Pinto, these efforts to specifically champion Black people have been vital for long before that.

“We've always had to create spaces for our own people to thrive and to fully be themselves,” she said. “I think as we move forward and continue to push the boundaries as those policies continue to get more restricted, we have to be diligent about protecting our own, and I think this is a way for us to show joy in the face of adversity.

“Joy is a contagious thing because if we put on an event where people are celebrated and they feel valued and seen as a whole human being, I think that's a way of protesting, of making space for these incredible individuals who are going to make up the next generation of athletes.”

Hello! Some free advice for a Wednesday: soccer investment is cheaper than NFL investment. And keep your shirt on…

On the way:

🏈 EPL vs NFL valuations

📈 A 64-team World Cup?

🟥 Ekitike's ‘stupid' red card

👏 Classy Vini Jr finish

Sold for their market value of $12.8billion (£9.4bn), the Dallas Cowboys would raise enough money to buy Real Madrid and Barcelona combined, with a sliver of spare change left over. Or, if you'd rather, Liverpool, Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Miami. Football is your oyster, essentially, if you happen to own the NFL's richest franchise.

Valuations in sports are so extreme these days that when the proposed sale of the LA Lakers in June priced them at $10bn, it occurred to me that ownership is now limited to the highest of high rollers. Yet despite its wealth and ever-increasing reach, the cost of soccer teams doesn't quite match up to those in other U.S. fields.

In the weeks and months ahead, it's possible — and probable — that one of the biggest Spanish sides going will pass into American ownership (doesn't everybody, eventually?). Atletico Madrid, as reported yesterday, are the subject of a takeover bid from Apollo Global Management, an asset firm based on Wall Street. If and when the transaction goes through, it will value them at $2.6bn. In other words, one Dallas Cowboys buys you five Atleticos.

With prescient timing, The Athletic's Chris Weatherspoon addressed this exact topic this morning: the reasons why certain NFL franchises (not to mention some in basketball and baseball) are worth more than Premier League clubs and other European football giants. And will we hit a point where the balance tips, making soccer the biggest investment show in town?

To some extent, soccer is the biggest investment show in town already. Professional football clubs vastly outnumber NFL franchises, and takeover bids coming out of the U.S. over the past five to 10 years are almost too numerous to count. Half of the Premier League is American-owned.

But any time I think of the size of the NFL, I think of the fabled waiting list for season tickets at the Green Bay Packers, reported to sit at around 150,000 names and counting. As Chris points out, franchises like the Packers have enormous captive audiences, making them a commercial dream. No business is ever unhappy about being oversubscribed.

He also highlighted a few other reasons for the disparity in valuations:

FIFA, in particular, would love to think that someday soon, football will take over the planet in its entirety. It's why the governing body targeted the U.S. with both its Club World Cup and next year's World Cup. The game's popularity grows exponentially — but American sport is still where the biggest fortunes stand to be blown.

Alexander Isak banked his first Liverpool goal last night (an instalment on £125m paid back) but sadly for him, nobody is talking about it.

A 2-1 third-round Carabao Cup victory over Southampton was more notable for what happened later in the tie. Hugo Ekitike, the other big-money forward signed by Liverpool over the summer, won it in the 85th minute… and then immediately got himself sent off.

Ekitike, you see, said emotions got the better of him and seemingly forgot he'd already been booked for punching the ball away. So when he took his shirt off to celebrate his goal — a yellow card offence in itself — he was cautioned for a second time. As red cards go, it's more dense than a chunk of osmium.

Arne Slot wasn't remotely sympathetic. “Needless and stupid,” was how Liverpool's head coach described it. The upshot is that Ekitike misses their next game through suspension, away at Crystal Palace on Saturday (a tricky fixture against a side with their tails up). Isak's had a torrid time in the PR stakes recently but, for one evening only, he won't have minded holding Ekitike's beer.

Diego Gomez should have something about him. It wasn't as if he came for pennies. The deal which brought him to Brighton from Inter Miami in January cost £11m.

But four goals away at Barnsley in the Carabao Cup last night was an absurd flex, not least because two of them were goal-of-the-season contenders. The strike for 3-0, above, is the pick of them for me. I could watch that swerve on a loop all day.

Arsenal have reportedly made contact with the entourage of a rising Serie A star but will have to splash the cash to sign him. The Gunners spent just under €300 million (£262m) on signings this summer but speculation is mounting that they are ready to go big again. But a certain European giant is unlikely to want to sell one of their prized assets.

FIFA held discussions on Tuesday about expanding the men's World Cup to a 64-team tournament in 2030 after receiving a formal pitch from a delegation of influential South American leaders.

The group included heads of state from Paraguay and Uruguay, as well as senior football executives from the South American confederation CONMEBOL and the head of the Argentine Football Association (AFA).

During meetings at FIFA's New York City headquarters inside Trump Tower, the FIFA president Gianni Infantino and general secretary Mattias Grafstrom received a number of politicians and football executives from Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay.

Alejandro Dominguez, president of South America's CONMEBOL federation and FIFA vice-president, led the discussions on behalf of the visiting delegation. He was joined by national president Santiago Pena of Paraguay and Yamandu Orsi of Uruguay. AFA chief Chiqui Tapia and his Paraguay and Uruguay counterparts, Robert Harrison and Nacho Alonso, were also present.

Argentina's head of state, Javier Milei, was not in attendance, as he was occupied by a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump amid economic turmoil in Argentina. Further meetings related to the 2030 World Cup are scheduled for this week.

The 64-team idea was first presented by the Uruguayan Football Association's president, Ignacio Alonso, during a FIFA Council meeting in March, according to The New York Times. The proposal surprised many on the call, but FIFA says it has a duty to consider ideas presented at its Council. In April, Dominguez pitched the idea to CONMEBOL's congress. He said the 64-team concept would be a one-off to mark the 100th anniversary of the first men's World Cup, which took place in Uruguay in 1930.

At the FIFA Congress in May, held in Paraguay, Dominguez urged FIFA to think about a unique approach for the centenary World Cup. He compared how a person might celebrate a 49th or 51st birthday differently from a 50th, saying dispensation should be made for special events.

“I would like to invite you to reflect together so we can do something that the world is waiting for, that the football community deserves. It is what football teaches us — to play as a team,” Dominguez said.

“I want to underline the words of Alejandro. He told all of us to think on how we can really celebrate it in the way it deserves to be celebrated. So every idea is a good idea,” Infantino said at the same Congress.

Grafstrom told reporters at the FIFA Congress that the presidents of CONMEBOL and FIFA “posed an open question about the Centenary World Cup.”

“All ideas are welcome, but no specific ideas have been discussed,” the FIFA general secretary said.

The tournament has grown in size in recent decades, having gone from 16 to 24 teams in 1982, then increasing to the 32-nation format in 1998, before becoming a 48-team competition for next summer's World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.

A 64-team competition would mean more than 30 per cent of FIFA 211 national teams would compete.

The idea has drawn opposition. UEFA president and FIFA vice-president Aleksander Ceferin described it as a “bad idea”, saying it would be damaging for the tournament but also for its impact on the qualification stage, which would have further reduced jeopardy.

CONCACAF president Victor Montagliani, a FIFA vice-president, expressed his opposition to the idea, saying: “It's not a great idea. We haven't even kicked the ball for the 48 (team format), and obviously they can study all they want, but it just doesn't feel right.”

Any decision to expand the tournament will need to be debated and approved by the FIFA Council.

The 2030 tournament is FIFA's most sprawling to date, as it will be hosted across three continents and six countries. It is set to be shared across Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina, who will each have one game at the start of the event, before the remainder of the schedule is split across Spain, Portugal and Morocco.

This workaround, however, has been deemed insufficient by the South Americans. Their continent has hosted only one recent men's World Cup, when Brazil was awarded the 2014 competition. The most recent before that was in Argentina in 1978. In the intervening years, Europe has hosted five tournaments, while Asia has hosted two.

CONMBEOL's minimal involvement in the 2030 competition has the potential to lock them out of the 2034 and 2038 World Cups due to FIFA's confederation rotation principle, which means a confederation must allow two World Cups to pass before it can once again be a host. It remains to be seen how stringently this is applied as World Cups become larger and cast across more countries and continents.

The six-nation, three-continent tournament for 2030 was perceived by many as being a useful outcome for Saudi Arabia, which secured a clear path to 2034 as three confederations (UEFA, CONMEBOL and CAF) were locked out by hosting 2030, while CONCACAF nations were unable to bid for 2034 due to hosting the North American World Cup in 2026.

However, the South Americans have now alighted upon their idea to convince FIFA to expand the 2030 edition to 64 teams. Multiple people close to the discussions, all of whom wished to remain anonymous to protect relationships, confirmed the idea was formally pushed during meetings in Trump Tower on Tuesday. The precise details of a 64-team format remain to be confirmed, but in the meeting, Dominguez suggested that Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay could all host a group each within the competition.

Those present posted small snippets of the meeting on Instagram Tuesday night.

Dominguez, in a video released on his account, said: “It cannot pass by as just another event, it cannot be a normal World Cup. We see this as a once-in-a-100 year opportunity.”

He posted a video from the streets of Manhattan where he said he was entering a “super-important” meeting and said he hoped to emerge with news that could impact the football world.

Pena, Paraguay's president, later posted a video, in which he is shown in the meeting saying: “We want to challenge ourselves. Encourage us to dream and dream big. I say it with great humility but huge responsibility: Paraguay stands ready. It wants to be a protagonist.”

Infantino, in the same video, appears to give encouragement. He tells the room: “Today, we really start working together as a team to make history. Working together to see how we can do something the world will not forget, because the people deserve it.”

When asked by The Athletic about Tuesday's meetings, FIFA referred to its position in March, where it said it had a duty to analyze any proposal made at a FIFA Council meeting.

Much of the aftermath of Manchester City's 1-1 draw with Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium focused on the cautious tactics of the hosts, somehow ignoring that it was the visitors who resorted to park-the-bus mechanisms in order to try and grind out a win. In the end, neither side truly deserved the victory and a point apiece seemed fair, but the performance from Pep Guardiola's men was strange in several ways.

Having lost 5-1 in this very same fixture back in February against a weaker Arsenal team than this, you can forgive City for returning to north London with the handbrake on. If they suffered another obliteration in that manner, they could already begin to kiss their Premier League title dreams goodbye.

In order to prevent this, Guardiola set out his stall in a far more conservative manner than ever before. Given Mikel Arteta had also picked a starting lineup showing a bit too much respect, City were actually good value for their 1-0 lead at half-time, hitting the Gunners with a killer counter which was expertly finished off by Erling Haaland. That excursion nine minutes in appeared to signal the end of their ambition, however, mustering up only one other chance of note from there on in. Nobody in blue could have any complaints about their barricades finally being breached by one straight ball over the top and a delectable dink from Gabriel Martinelli.

It begs the question over where City are going. Are they actually serious contenders or are they still way behind in their rebuild? Can Guardiola reinvent himself to keep up with this new wave of managers?

Learner Tien, Dino Prizmic and Shang Juncheng all earned victories on the ATP Tour last week in Hangzhou and Chengdu, respectively, increasing their chances of playing at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, held from 17-21 December in Jeddah.

Tien cemented his third-placed position in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah with a quarter-final run at the ATP 250 hard-court event in Hangzhou. The 19-year-old American defeated Mariano Navone and Giulio Zeppieri before he lost to eventual finalist Valentin Royer. Tien is hoping to make his second appearance at the 20-and-under event after reaching the title match last year.

Fourth-placed Prizmic captured his third ATP Tour match win of the season at the event in Chengdu. The Croatian, who has lifted two ATP Challenger Tour trophies in 2025, defeated Cincinnati semi-finalist Terence Atmane and then pushed Top 10 star Lorenzo Musetti to three sets in the second round. Prizmic is aiming to make his debut in Jeddah.

China's Shang continued his comeback from injury with a first-round win against Zizou Bergs in Chengdu. The 20-year-old lefty returned to Tour at the end of July in Toronto after missing the first six months of the season due to a foot injury.

Shang is 18th in the Live Race To Jeddah and will need a couple of deep runs in the next eight weeks to move into qualification contention. This week, he is playing at the ATP 500 event in Beijing and opens against Arthur Cazaux.

Fifth-placed Alexander Blockx, sixth-placed Nicolai Budkov Kjaer and eighth-placed Martin Landaluce are in Challenger Tour action this week in Orleans, while seventh-placed Nishesh Basavareddy lost in the opening round of qualifying in Beijing.

The world No. 2 vowed to be less “predictable” after suffering a four-set defeat to Carlos Alcaraz.ByDavid KanePublished Sep 24, 2025 copy_link

Published Sep 24, 2025

Jannik Sinner appears to be making good on his promise to become more unpredictable on the tennis court court, the former world No. 1 discussing changes to his practice repertoire in the wake of a 2025 US Open final defeat to Carlos Alcaraz.“We've been reflecting a lot to that final,” Sinner said in a pre-tournament press conference at this week's China Open. “We are working on new things. We are changing a lot of small things where I'm thinking of now. The amount of mistakes at the moment is for sure a little bit higher, but I hope that this after recovers in a very positive way, no?”👉 Click here to stream Sinner's China Open first round on TennisChannel.com Approximate start time: Thursday September 25, 7AM ETSinner fell to No. 2 in the ATP rankings after falling one match shy of defending his 2024 title in Flushing Meadows and, following the match, opened up about a desire to be less “predictable” on court.“I'm going to aim to, you know, maybe even losing some matches from now on, but trying to do some changes, you know, trying to be a bit more unpredictable as a player, because I think that's what I have to do, trying to become a better tennis player,” the Italian said in his runner-up press conference earlier this month.

It was a stark admission from the 24-year-old Italian who otherwise enjoyed a remarkable follow-up to his breakthrough 2024 season, winning two more Grand Slam trophies—including a first Wimbledon title over Alcaraz—and reaching the final of all four major tournaments in 2025. He also maintained a 65-week stretch atop the ATP rankings despite missing three months of tournaments due to a suspension for an anti-doping rule violation incurred last spring.Still, Sinner feels there's room for improvement, particularly against Alcaraz, who has become primary rival and leads their head-to-head, 9-5.“I'm trying to be more prepared for the next match what I will play against him,” Sinner said in New York. “It also, I feel like, depends how you arrive to play against Carlos. You know, one thing is when the scoreline, you know, matches before are comfortable but you always do the same things, like I did, for example, during this tournament, you know, I didn't make one serve-volley, didn't use a lot of drop shots, and then you arrive to a point where you play against Carlos where you have to go out of the comfort zone.”

Sinner is the top seed in Beijing, as Alcaraz has opted not to defend his title and instead compete at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships in Tokyo. The Italian will open against Marin Cilic in the first round.Might fans see a new Sinner on court against the 2014 US Open champion?“It's just a question of time,” Sinner said of his tactical tweaks. “Let's see how long I take it. I don't know how much I'm able to do it on actual match court because one thing is practice and one thing is match. Let's see.“Yeah, I'm very motivated. It's great to work on something new, then we see how this ends up. We always try to move forward. One step in front is always better than two steps back. Let's see what we can do.”

I want to use this opportunity to help make the world a better place—sometimes on a small scale, sometimes on a larger one.

“I've been lucky to pursue my passion through tennis, but I know millions of children never get the chance to follow their dreams because they don't have access to school,” Sinner said in event remarks. “Standing here tonight, I see the project is finally alive, and we are ready to help children realize their dreams.”

Abbi Pulling reviews the Baku Grand Prix on The Cooldown Room

Race Recap: Azerbaijan

Mark Hughes and illustrator Giorgio Piola delve into the factors that have given Red Bull a well-balanced car across recent races.

The Max Verstappen/Red Bull resurgence of the last two races has inevitably led to speculation about whether this winning form can be extended beyond just the outlying low-downforce demands of Monza and Baku.

Team boss Laurent Mekies was urging caution of that idea in Baku, saying: “The people back at the factory have been working so hard in trying to understand what has been limiting us with this car. We have been developing our understanding on this and this has been helping.

And he almost “sent an email” to attendees ahead of time explaining what he hoped it would accomplish. That probably would have been a good idea.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



Nate Bargatze proved to be a charitable, generous man at the 77th Emmy Awards — not that he especially planned to be.


	The standup comic said on his Nateland podcast he never planned on donating $250,000 of his own money to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, as he did at the end of the Emmys.




	“I had it in my head one way. It kind of came out another way, but — the reasoning was there,” Bargatze said of the running gag. “I wasn't gonna give that money at the end, like, I wasn't thinking I was gonna have to. But the way it went, I was like, ‘I can't— I'm not gonna not…'”

	The bit went like this: Bargatze, while opening the live awards show, pledged $100,000 of his own money to the Boys & Girls Clubs. Awesome. Even awesome-r, for every tick under 45 seconds a winner's acceptance speech lasted, Bargatze would add another $1,000 from his own pocket. However, for every second over 45 seconds a winner went, he'd deduct $1,000 from the running tally. The bank ended up quite a bit in the red.




			Related Video		







	Bargatze says CBS had specifically asked him to come up with a way to keep acceptance speeches tight. CBS “loved” what he came up with, Bargatze said, as did “everyone at home.”


	You know who didn't? “A lot of the reviews,” Bargatze acknowledged.


Shameless plug here for me being among the few in the media to defend the bit. (That said, it sounds like I was wrong about Bargatze preplanning to cover the overages personally. Whether he wanted to or had to, in the end, he did the right thing.)

	











	Bargatze saw this thing going a whole ‘nother way.


	“I thought it was gonna be, I dunno, Netflix donating, or Apple,” Bargatze said on Nateland's 271st episode. “If someone was giving these long speeches, I just thought they could be like, ‘and Netflix is gonna cover my overage.'”


	“In my head, I pictured they could then go long, but then be a hero,” he said. “But I think I could have explained it more, to be honest.”


	And he almost did. Bargatze said he “almost sent an email out” ahead of the show to explain the game and what he hoped to accomplish with it. A good idea, in hindsight.

Jimmy Kimmel made his return to late-night on Tuesday, a week after Disney and ABC made the call to pull Jimmy Kimmel Live! from the air, citing the host's comments about the right-wing response to Charlie Kirk's death. Media companies Sinclair and Nexstar are continuing to preempt the series. Still, while it didn't air on their ABC-affiliate channels last night, Kimmel's 30-minute monologue has racked up nearly 12 million views in the past 12 hours on YouTube.


	The views are continuing to climb, setting the video on track to be the most-viewed upload from Jimmy Kimmel Live! since the host sat down with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and 50 Cent last year. That clip sits at 16 million views.


	“Maybe most of all, I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” Kimmel said in his emotional monologue. “People I never would have imagined, like Ben Shapiro, Clay Travis, Candace Owens, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul. Even my old pal Ted Cruz.… Even though I don't agree with many of those people on most subjects — some of the things they say even make me want to throw up — it takes courage for them to speak out against this administration, and they did, and they deserve credit for it.”

	











	This throws a wrench into the Trump administration's plans. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr claimed that Kimmel attempted to push the narrative that Kirk's shooter “was somehow a MAGA or Republican-motivated person,” again calling it “sick,” in an effort to have the show pulled.

	Donald Trump himself threw something of a fit about Kimmel's return. In a rant on Truth Social, he declaring that he intends to sue ABC for bringing the show back. “I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back,” Trump wrote. “The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‘talent' was never there.”

	He added: “He is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers! Let Jimmy Kimmel rot in his bad Ratings.”

	Trump is referencing the settlement in which Paramount agreed to pay $16 million in donations to the future Trump Library after he filed a lawsuit against 60 Minutes, objecting to an interview with Kamala Harris that was not edited to his liking. Around the same time, Paramount was vying for federal approval of an $8 billion merger with Skydance, which had been in limbo for some time.


	When Stephen Colbert referred to the deal as a “big fat bribe,” Paramount suddenly announced it was ending The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, despite the show's top-ranking ratings. Maybe Trump assumed the same would happen to Kimmel. However, if more than 11 million people are willing to tune in online as well, his fight can't be with the networks. Is he going to sue YouTube next? That would make for a great Jimmy Kimmel Live! segment.

A 66-year-old two-time Oscar winner who's still near the height of her powers and has presumably made enough money for her grandkids to retire at birth, Emma Thompson could spend the rest of her life guest-starring on British TV shows and sleeping in her own bed at night and no one would think any less of her. But actors have to act (we love them for that, and that for them), and even a screen icon of Thompson's cachet is powerless to pass up the prospect of saying dialogue like “Freakin' fiddlesticks shitBUNS!” in a Marge Gunderson-thick Brainerd accent.

 










So while the rest of us might have been happy to stay warm at home, Thompson hoofed it out to the snowy wilds of Finland in order to film “Dead of Winter,” a programmatic but tightly plotted thriller — set amidst a brutal Minnesota blizzard — in which she plays a widowed ice fisher who asks the wrong guy for directions on the way to a certain lake (he's not quite in the middle of feeding a human body into a wood chipper, but he might as well be). Hardly a scene goes by where Thompson isn't beaten, chased, and/or shot at in sub-zero temperatures, but you get the sense that all of the frostbite in the world couldn't have stopped her from getting her own little taste of “Fargo.”

That passion — that enduring sense of purpose — is reflected across the course of a small but satisfying movie about people who are either desperate for something to live for, or living only for their desperation. If only they could find a way forward for themselves. Barb Sorenson (Thompson) is looking for precisely that when she heads out into the cold for a day on the ice. All “Minnesota nice” and quiet sorrow, she planned to start her search at a fishing spot that was especially meaningful to her late husband; the only problem is that she can't find it. 

So she asks Camo Jacket — as Marc Menchaca's oafishly menacing character is identified in the credits — to point her in the right direction, even though he doesn't seem like the most trustworthy fella. Minutes later, after Barb's truck breaks down, she watches Camo Jacket hunt down and hand-tie a young woman (Laurel Madsen) who escaped from his house. In lieu of anything else to do with herself, Barb decides to intervene. But sneaking into Camo Jacket's basement and stealing the girl won't be easy, because Camo Jacket is married to Purple Lady (played by a rifle-toting Judy Greer, a fentanyl lollipop always lodged in her mouth), and she isn't quite as helpless as her husband. 

 










Directing from a lean and functional script by Nicholas Jacobson-Larson and Dalton Leeb, Brian Kirk (“21 Bridges”) maneuvers these four characters around each other with care and a clear eye for tension. The action is taut, the stakes are clear, and Kirk never misses a chance to remind us that all of these are just regular people who've crossed paths in a dark place. These are humble Americans more accustomed to baiting fish than shooting humans, and while that may not excuse all of the thriller cliches this movie indulges when push comes to shove during its do-or-die third act (i.e. someone running out of ammo right when they've lined up a certain kill shot), every Coen brothers-esque blunder reinforces the idea that these characters have been forcibly diverted from the lives they were meant to live.

To that end, the movie's greatest conflict might be that between their folksy earnestness and their flinty desperation, and it's a conflict that every member of the cast is able to articulate within themselves without resorting to caricature. The mystery as to why Purple Lady and Camo Jacket have kidnapped a suicidal woman is too opaque at first (something to do with organ harvesting, it seems?), and then too impractical by the end (she's getting a doctor to do what?), but Greer always shines as a self-interested villain, and she manages to sell the absolute shit out of an unscrupulous woman who's doing what she has to in order to survive. You may not believe in the full scope of her character's circumstances, but not for a second will you doubt the wincing sincerity of her “sorry, not sorry” attitude toward saving her own skin. 

 










Greer's Purple Jacket makes a terrific foil for Thompson's Barb, whose “aw shucks” affect is pointed towards risking her life for a perfect stranger. Recurring flashbacks — in which a younger Barb is embodied by Thompson's own daughter Gaia Wise — do more to disrupt the film's suspense than to meaningfully complicate its protagonist, but the most impactful of these glimpses into her marriage offer some insight into the various roles she hoped to play over the course of her life (wife, mother, entrepreneur, etc.), and hint at the difficulties that have come from being recast against her will. 

If Thompson exudes too much tenacity for us to need such labored glimpses into her character's past, the extra insight makes it that much easier to buy her character's transformation into a badass good Samaritan, and “Dead of Winter” never loses sight of what its backwoods shenanigans mean to Barb on a deeper level. People will do anything to survive, but a life without purpose can be worse than death; watching Emma Thompson bleed, shiver, and shoot her way through a movie this cold is proof enough of that.

Vertical Entertainment will release “Dead of Winter” in theaters on Friday, September 26.

Amazon MGM Studios‘ adaptation of Rebecca Yarros' bestselling novel Fourth Wing is closing in on a new showrunner. Wednesday Season 2 executive producer Meredith Averill is in final negotiations to board the project as writer and executive producer, sources tell Deadline.


	She would succeed Moira Walley-Beckett who left in June, a year after she was tapped to pen the adaptation. WandaVision creator Jac Schaeffer was among a number of top writers who met on the project.


	The Fourth Wing TV series comes from Michael B. Jordan's Outlier Society, Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy's Kilter Films and Premediated Productions.

At the order of her mother, who is a General in the military of Navarre, Violet enters the brutal ranks of Basgiath War College, which trains up-and-coming riders through the Graduate or Die method.


Fourth Wing has spent 88 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, 18 of them at #1.

The comic's Mister Whatever tour takes him to his hometown in 2026.


							By 

	Mikey O'Connell


TV Features Editor


John Mulaney is going big with his current tour, following a string of sold-out dates with a marquee performance in his hometown next year. The stand-up is set to play Chicago's Wrigley Field, marking the first time a comic has ever headlined the historic ballpark.


	The Everybody's Live host announced the news on Tuesday night during — what else? — a Chicago Cubs game. Before the Cubs lost to the New York Mets, Mulaney sang “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” to the crowd and then took a seat in the broadcast booth to share the news — noting the venue's daunting capacity.

	











	“Look, if Mark Grace could come out there every day and just deliver ripping cigarettes, I can face down this crowd too,” offered Mulaney.

	Tickets are not yet on sale for the July 11, 2026, performance but it is expected to draw a crowd of tens of thousands. (During baseball games, Wrigley regularly fits north of 40,000.)


	Mulaney began touring Mister Whatever earlier in 2025, and the last three months of the year are packed with dates throughout the U.S. A taped special of his new set has yet to be announced, but it's only a matter of time.And for those more interested in Mulaney's musical stylings, the MLB graciously posted the below clip of his seventh inning stretch serenade.

A woman claims Metro sexually assaulted her in 2016, while the producer calls the case a "shakedown" she concocted while high on ayahuasca.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



The trial has just begun in a rape lawsuit against Metro Boomin – but attorneys for the superstar producer's alleged victim are asking for a mistrial, saying a defense lawyer made improper claims about her sexual history during opening arguments.


	A jury in Los Angeles federal court heard opening arguments on Tuesday (Sept. 23) for the civil case brought by Vanessa LeMaistre, who alleges she blacked out after ingesting Xanax and alcohol in Metro Boomin's studio during a 2016 recording session and later woke up to the producer (Leland Wayne) raping her.


	Metro denies the claims, saying the case is a “classic celebrity shakedown” that LeMaistre concocted while hallucinating on ayahuasca. He has always maintained that their 2016 sexual encounter was consensual – but lawyers for LeMaistre say Metro's team went too far during opening statements on Tuesday by arguing that the two had also had consensual sex before that night at the recording studio.


	In all sexual violence trials, there are strict rules that limit the defense from alluding to an alleged victim's sexual history or apparent proclivities. Typically, a defendant needs to ask permission from the judge before bringing up any sexual conduct that is not tied to the specific incident at issue in a trial.


	LeMaistre's attorneys – led by Michael Willemin of the powerhouse plaintiff's firm Wigdor – say in a mistrial motion filed late on Tuesday that Metro's lawyers did not properly seek judicial approval before making these statements about their prior sexual history (which LeMaistre denies).


	“If plaintiff's counsel was provided fair warning and a [hearing] was held, the claim that plaintiff engaged in consensual sex with the defendant prior to the sexual assault would have been precluded,” Willemin writes. “And, even if the court made the determination that the claim of consensual sex pre-dating the sexual assault was far more probative than prejudicial, plaintiff would have known such information was going to be permitted and would certainly have addressed it in plaintiff's opening statement.”


	Willemin says there's “no possible way to undo” the prejudice that Metro's opening caused, since jurors cannot unhear this statement. He's asking Judge R. Gary Klausner to declare a mistrial and start the whole case over again.


	Judge Klausner will likely address this issue before the trial is set to resume on Wednesday (Sept. 24). Metro's lawyers from the firm Sanders Roberts did not immediately return a request for comment on the matter.


	LeMaistre sued Metro in 2024, claiming she met the producer in Las Vegas in the spring of 2016. LeMaistre says she confided in Metro about the recent death of her 9-month-old son, and that they “bonded over the ability of music to help people in their darkest moments.”


	But LeMaistre's belief about her bond with Metro allegedly “shattered” the following September, when the producer invited her to watch him work in his California recording studio. LeMaistre says she had a shot of alcohol and half a tablet of Xanax, then blacked out, waking up on a bed in a different location “completely unable to move or make a sound” while Metro raped her.


	LeMaistre alleges she became pregnant as a result of the assault and had an abortion in November 2016. Notably, the lawsuit claims the attack is referenced in Metro's 2017 song “Rap Saved Me” with Offset, 21 Savage and Quavo.


	The lyrics in question, rapped by 21 Savage and Offset in the chorus, are: “She took a Xanny, then she fainted/ I'm from the gutter, ain't no changing/ From the gutter, rap saved me/ She drive me crazy, have my baby.”


	The lyrical reference in LeMaistre's lawsuit is surprising, since Metro is a music producer and songwriter but does not typically write lyrics or rap himself. Metro has denied writing the “Rap Saved Me” lyrics, as well as the rest of LeMaistre's allegations.


	Metro's position is that LeMaistre has transformed a consensual sexual encounter into a false tale of rape in order to squeeze money out of him. He's focused heavily on LeMaistre journal entries from when she was high on ayahuasca in 2024, in which she detailed a “plan” to sue Metro for more than $3 million.


	The issue of ayahuasca took center stage when LeMaistre testified in court on Tuesday following opening statements. According to a report by independent journalist Meghann Cuniff, LeMaistre insisted from the witness stand that she did not hallucinate on the drug. Rather, said LeMaistre, the ayahuasca merely helped her come to terms with the fact that her nonconsensual sex with Metro had been rape.


	Metro himself is due to testify during the trial, which is slated to last four days total.

UPDATE 9/24: “The Savant” star Jessica Chastain in an Instagram statement made clear that she is “not aligned” with Apple on the studio's decision to delay the show, though she respects their decision to do so and admires their partnership. She explains that “I've never shied away from difficult subjects, and while I wish this show wasn't so relevant, unfortunately it is.” 

Chastain's full statement reads: “I want to say how much I value my partnership with Apple. They've been incredible collaborators and I deeply respect their team. That said, I wanted to reach out and let you know that we're not aligned on the decision to pause the release of ‘The Savant.' In the last five years since we've been making the show, we've seen an unfortunate amount of violence in the United States: the kidnapping attempt on Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer; the January 6th attack on the Capitol; the assassination attempts on President Trump; the political assassinations of Democratic representatives in Minnesota; the attack on Speaker Pelosi's husband; the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk; the recent shooting at an ABC affiliate station in California; and over 300 school shootings across this country. These incidents, though far from encompassing the full range of violence witnessed in the United States, illustrate a broader mindset that crosses the political spectrum and must be confronted. I've never shied away from difficult subjects, and while I wish this show wasn't so relevant, unfortunately it is. ‘The Savant' is about the heroes who work every day to stop violence before it happens, and honoring their courage feels more urgent than ever. While I respect Apple's decision to pause the release for now, I remain hopeful the show will reach audiences soon. Until then, I'm wishing safety and strength for everyone, and I'll let you know if and when ‘The Savant' is released.

Original story follows: The anxiety around the political and cultural reaction to the killing of Charlie Kirk is so high that we could see more media companies on edge about how audiences react to their content. “The Savant,” a limited series starring Jessica Chastain originally set to premiere this Friday on Apple TV+, will be postponed, a rep for Apple TV+ told IndieWire.

 










While no specific reason was given, nor was any new release date announced, it's believed that current events contributed to the delay.

“After careful consideration, we have made the decision to postpone ‘The Savant.' We appreciate your understanding and look forward to releasing the series at a future date,” Apple TV+ said in a statement. 

“The Savant” stars Chastain as a woman who infiltrates online extremist groups in an attempt to discover mass shootings and extremist acts of terrorism before they happen. The series was created by Melissa James Gibson and was inspired by a 2019 article in Cosmopolitan, “Is It Possible to Stop a Mass Shooting Before It Happens?” 

The first trailer for the series, which you can watch below, shows her engaging online with extremists, attempting to think like them and expose their actions before reporting them to the authorities. It shows a series of “snipers, bombings, ambushes” — with Chastain specifically trying to bring down someone who wants to make an imprint on history with the type of event people refer to “with a month and a date.” It's also a show that grapples with Chastain's moral dilemma of wondering if it's right to be engaging with such people, even if it's in the name of a greater good.

“The Savant” would not be the first time a show or an episode was delayed in order to provide some breathing room from real-life tragedies. But the fervor over “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” being pre-empted last week (it comes back on air tonight) is likely just the first example of media companies in this very moment looking closely at what's being said and represented on their screens as showrunners reach for the headlines with politically relevant commentary and entertainment.

“We're not aligned on the decision to pause the release,” Chastain wrote on Instagram, adding that she hopes it receives a release date soon.

Jessica Chastain, the star of the Apple TV+ series The Savant, said Wednesday that she does not agree with the platform's decision to postpone its release.


	Apple said Tuesday that it made the decision to postpone the thriller after “careful consideration.” The political undertones of the show, which sees Chastain star as a top-secret undercover investigator, nicknamed “The Savant,” who infiltrates online hate groups and takes them down from the inside, may have been deemed inappropriate in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination earlier this month.

The new case comes after the star was acquitted on criminal sex-trafficking charges and just weeks before he's sentenced on lesser prostitution convictions.

	Bill Donahue



Sean “Diddy” Combs is facing a new civil abuse lawsuit from his longtime stylist Deonte Nash, months after the ex-employee testified against the hip hop mogul at his criminal trial.


	In a case submitted Wednesday in a Los Angeles court, Deonte Nash accuses Combs of assault, sexual battery and other wrongdoing – the latest of dozens of such lawsuits filed against Diddy since abuse claims first surfaced in 2023.


	The case from Nash, who also served as a stylist to Combs' longtime girlfriend and alleged abuse victim Cassie Ventura, comes after he testified at the star's blockbuster criminal trial in May, and less than two weeks before the star will be sentenced for his convictions on prostitution charges.


	“Though defendants have silenced him for years, Mr. Nash is no longer willing to give in to this fear for his life and is now standing up to demand justice,” his lawyers write in the court filings.




			Trending on Billboard		







	In his lengthy complaint, Nash says Combs turned his dream of working as a celebrity stylist “into a nightmare that he was forced to endure nearly every single day” for the ten years he worked for the star from 2008 to 2018.


	“Combs … subjected Mr. Nash to a decade of sexual and physical assault, sexual and verbal harassment, trafficking, degradation and humiliation, threats to his life and well-being, stalking, control, and psychological manipulation,” his lawyers write. “Combs used his power and threats of harm to compel Mr. Nash to do his bidding and prevent him from leaving defendants' control.”


	At a party in “2013 or 2014,” Nash says the star exposed his penis and moved closer to him until the stylist told him to stop. During another alleged incident in 2016, Nash says Diddy grabbed his hand and forced him to touch his penis. In yet another incident in 2018, he says the star “grinded” on his genitals in a “sexually-charged” way: “Mr. Nash felt violated and offended by this unwanted sexual touching.”


	The lawsuit also claims Diddy subjected Nash to physical violence, as well as “unreasonable demands and expectations” as his stylist. He says he eventually had “no other choice” but to resign in 2018, but that Combs then “continued to threaten Mr. Nash after his employment ended.”


	In a statement to Billboard on Wednesday, Diddy's attorney Erica Wolff called Nash “another opportunist looking to profit off his proximity to celebrity” who had filed a lawsuit that was “riddled with falsehoods.”


	“Mr. Nash's tabloid-style accusations are insulting not only to Mr. Combs but also to the countless individuals who worked honorably and professionally within his companies,” Wolff said. “In court, the truth will prevail, as it did in his criminal trial: that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone—adult or minor, man or woman. Mr. Combs looks forward to clearing his name again in a court of law where truth matters.”


	Combs was arrested and charged in September 2024 with racketeering (RICO) and sex trafficking violations over accusations that he ran a sprawling criminal operation aimed at facilitating freak-offs — elaborate events in which he allegedly forced Ventura and other women to have sex with male escorts while he watched and masturbated.


	At his blockbuster trial this spring, Nash took the witness stand for the prosecution, telling jurors he had seen Diddy physically abuse Ventura and threaten to release sex tapes of her if she didn't do what he demanded.


	But when the verdict was handed down, jurors largely cleared Combs, acquitting him on the core RICO and sex trafficking charges that could have seen him sentenced to prison for life. He was convicted only on two lesser counts of transporting Ventura and others across state lines for prostitution.


	Combs is set for sentencing on those convictions on Oct. 3. His lawyers asked the judge Monday to sentence him to 14 months in prison — a sentence that would see him released almost immediately on time served.


	But even if he's released quickly, Diddy is facing dozens of cases like Nash's, accusing him of rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment and various other forms of sexual abuse. Several have been dismissed in recent months, including one case filed by Making the Band 2 contestant Sara Rivers and another case by a John Doe plaintiff, but many others remain pending.

Columnist/International Editor At Large


EXCLUSIVE: Denis Villeneuve will embark on the search for an actor to play the world's most famous fictional spy, James Bond, next year when he completes production on Dune: Part Three. Those familiar with the matter tell us that the director and his collaborators are seeking a “fresh face” to take on the 007 mantle in Bond 26.


	Also, Bond … James Bond will be male, as written by creator Ian Fleming, and importantly, will be an actor who hails from the British isles. 


	Yes, they want a Brit to play Bond.


	That rules out fanciful speculation that the likes of Timothée Chalamet, Glen Powell, Austin Butler, Jacob Elordi and others who don't hail from UK shores are in the running.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Frankly, 99.9% of the names we've heard speculated online so far won't make the cut.


	Those in the know tell us the ideal approach is to cast “an unknown,” possibly in his late 20s or early 30s, to play what Fleming called “a blunt instrument” — the lethal but “extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened.”


	If that criteria is stuck to, that means favourites such as Tom Hardy, aged 47, Idris Elba at 53 and Henry Cavill, aged 42, presumably don't match what Villeneuve, producers David Heyman and Amy Pascal, and execs at Amazon MGM Studios are leaning towards.


	Also, consider that by the time Bond 26 begins shooting in 2027, both Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Jack Lowden will be 37 years of age. Will they be too old for Villeneuve?


	How rugged and imposing will this Bond be? Fleming describes Bond as being over 6 foot tall, even taller in his best Jermyn Street brogues. Daniel Craig is shorter than that.


	But have a think about Steven Knight's writing credits, a key source suggests, referring to the screenwriter picked to write the script for the Amazon MGM Studios production. 


	Knight's work includes SAS Rogue Heroes, Peaky Blinders and Eastern Promises, all of them featuring kick-ass, bone-crunching scenes. “Whoever it is, has to look like he could kill you with his bare hands in a trice. From the moment you see him, that has to be readily apparent,” a person close to discussions tells us.

	











	Online speculators and betting companies throw out names without thinking who Bond is. Knight will be going back to Fleming's earliest novels — Casino Royale (1953), Live and Let Die (1954), Moonraker (1955), Diamonds Are Forever (1956), From Russia, with Love (1957), Doctor No (1958) and Goldfinger (1959) — to help remind us who Fleming's protagonist is. Might the new Bond be more in the mould of a younger Sean Connery who originated 007 in 1962's Dr. No?


	There's a sense from the many conversations I've had that Knight's going back to Bond's beginnings as a Royal Navy Commander before being recruited by MI6, the UK's foreign intelligence agency, to perhaps chart how Bond attained 007 status. I want to stress that this is what I'm hearing but to caution that none of this is confirmed or fully formed because the script is still being written and the direction of travel is still up for grabs.


	Could Bond be played by a non Caucasian, I asked sources? He could, came the reply. As always, well, nearly always, it'll come down to this: Are they right for Bond? Are they right for the story that Villeneuve and screenwriter Knight will be telling?


	While we're here, it's worth pointing out the obvious: Bond 26 will not take up where No Time to Die, the final iteration in the franchise under Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, left us; with Bond dead. “It's a new Bond, a new start, a fresh everything,” is how it was put to me by a key source who adds that it's unlikely many associated with the past Bond regime will be involved with Bond 26. That said, I suspect a few old Bond hands might well be consulted on the quiet in the snug of a private club in Pall Mall, London.


	An unprecedented number of applicants have already sent in their pitch to play James Bond to the production. “Every name you've heard of, and many you've never heard of,” a well-placed mole revealed. “We've been flooded. But understand that the casting process has not begun and it won't until Denis finishes the Dune movie,” they continued.


	It pays to remember that  Craig, who, although famous to those of us who followed his career on stage and in independent and Hollywood movies, was not a household name when he was picked to play Fleming's approved British government assassin. I know that Broccoli knew of Craig's theater history but it wasn't until she saw Matthew Vaughn's Layer Cake that she became convinced he should be cast for Casino Royale. 


	British actors in their mid 20s to early 30s, with stellar acting chops, who fit the Bond mould, are going to be under an intense spotlight for the next 12 months. Bond … James Bond is somewhere out there.


	Our sources indicate that the film will be released in 2028 with filming due to take place in 2027. There's a lot of talk about the movie premiering in the November slot favored by past Bond movies.


	By the way, just because Bond will be British, it doesn't mean that other roles, such as the Bond foe and the actress leads, can't be performed by non-Brits, as has been the case for eons.

I say he should bring back one person from the previous regime: Daniel Kleinman to do the opening titles.

Andrew Koji please

Given the lead time on this, even if they cast a young-ish guy, he'll probably age out before the picture is released.

Tom Austen… Your time has come.

The wise thing will be to go back to Flemings original vision and build from there, give us the true bond ignore the parody's and  misinterpretations.

Fresh off its IPO, the indie disruptor is betting big on global audiences. But its values-based playbook may not translate everywhere.


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	Barely a week since Angel Studios rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange, and the faith-friendly disruptor is still basking in the glow of its high-profile debut and feeling the heat that comes with it. The Utah-based studio behind Sound of Freedom has gone from a family-run outsider operation to a $1.6 billion public company in less than a decade. Its rise reflects not only the strength of a niche market hungry for values-driven storytelling but also the new pressures of proving that a homespun model can scale under Wall Street's unforgiving gaze. It comes as the studio has expanded internationally, striking distribution agreements across Europe, Latin America, and Asia in an effort to prove its grassroots, faith-friendly business model can resonate worldwide.

	Angel's secret weapon has been its 1.5 million-strong “Angel Guild,” paying members who double as financiers and gatekeepers, voting on which projects make it to screens, as well as providing Kickstarter-style capital investments and a “pay-it-forward” booking system that allows people to buy and then donate movie tickets to Angel Studios releases for others to use.




	“Rather than having a couple dozen people make all the decisions about every movie that goes out, I can't take a movie into the studio and stream it or take it to theaters unless the guild passes it,” chief content officer Jeffrey Harmon explained, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in June, ahead of its IPO.


	That grassroots democracy has delivered some startling wins, including the $250 million global success of Sound of Freedom and The King of Kings, a South Korean-produced animated hit about the life of Jesus, which has grossed more than $70 million worldwide. Media analyst Evan Shapiro estimates that from 2023 to 2025, Angel's releases averaged $34.7 million per title, outpacing indie rivals like A24.

	











	Angel's pitch to investors is that audiences in middle America, the same group that Taylor Sheridan tapped to create his Yellowstone television empire, will flock to faith-friendly movies that embrace a more conservative worldview.


	“Angel is a response to Hollywood gatekeepers being out of touch,” says Angel CEO and co-founder. “We have flipped the model, empowering our 1.5 million Angel Guild members to be virtual co-producers, deciding what values-driven film and television shows get made and distributed. While we are encouraged by the early response to the power of our new model, we are focused on building lasting value over the long term.”


	But the company's bold approach comes with obvious risks. Angel has yet to turn a profit. In the first half of 2025, it booked $135 million in revenue but still posted a $53.3 million loss. The company has attributed much of its spending to efforts to expand its Angel Guild membership base, though detailed breakdowns of marketing costs are not publicly available. Just ahead of its listing, Angel raised $55 million from more than 40,000 individual investors and secured a $100 million credit facility with Trinity Capital. According to summaries of its filings, Angel has also used high-interest debt and other financing arrangements tied to revenue streams such as Sound of Freedom. These moves provided the studio with growth capital, but also raised questions about potential dilution, leverage, and the durability of its financial runway.

	











	The international expansion adds another layer of uncertainty. Whether Angel's blend of evangelical-inspired hits and broader family fare can travel beyond its U.S. base remains an open question. “Europe is a more secular market generally,” Harmon admitted to THR, but noted he sees strong growth potential in territories like Brazil, which boasts a more faith-focused audience. “They embrace the faith films more so than even the U.S. does.”


	The company has already partnered with Brazil's largest faith-based distributors for theatrical rollouts, inked a slate deal with U.K.-based distributor Kova for a pipeline of titles, and secured streaming and theatrical partnerships across Latin America. Angel has also pursued selective distribution agreements in Asia, including South Korea — home to a large Christian community — where The King of Kings became a local hit before expanding globally. These deals show Angel adapting to territory-specific partners, but also highlight the challenge of tailoring its model to vastly different cultural markets.


	The studio has also run into friction with creatives. A bitter arbitration battle over The Chosen ended with Angel losing rights to its biggest series (Angel is appealing), and a lawsuit with Slingshot, producer of the animated feature David, is ongoing. Angel president Jordan Harmon has previously waved off the disputes, noting that lawsuits in the entertainment industry are “like pigeons in New York City. It's just the reality of this space.”

	











	Despite those bumps, Angel is charging ahead. The studio has teed up The Senior, a sports drama starring Michael Chiklis as a 59-year-old who returns to college to play football, and Zero A.D., a biblical thriller from Sound of Freedom director Alejandro Monteverde, starring Sam Worthington, Ben Mendelsohn, Gael García Bernal and Jim Caviezel. Its 2026 slate includes Young Washington, a George Washington origin story timed to hit theaters next summer during America's 250th anniversary celebrations.


	Angel Studios shares, trading under ticker symbol ANGX, have dropped from around $13 after going as high as $20.39 and as low as $4.52. On Tuesday, the stock had closed at $5. 


	Given the current cultural moment, Angel Studios' IPO looks particularly fortuitous. But Wall Street's memory is short, and overseas audiences, which have proven resistant to patriotic American fare — James Gunn's Superman being a case in point — may prove harder to proselytize. Barely a week into its life as a public company, Angel has shown it can light a spark. The question is whether that spark can sustain a flame big enough to keep both its faithful backers and its new investors believing.

What can't Harris Dickinson do? He's an actor, a Beatle, a babygirl, a writer/director, and now a film curator.

His feature directing debut, “Urchin,” opens from 1-2 Special in New York and Los Angeles on October 10 before expanding nationwide on October 17. Ahead of the IndieWire-raved film starring Frank Dillane as a self-destructive London drifter, the Roxy Cinema in downtown Manhattan will host Harris Dickinson Selects. Dickinson himself curated the film series to invite audiences “inside the visual and emotional landscape that helped shape his first feature film,” per the Roxy. IndieWire shares more exclusive details below.

“Harris Dickinson has quietly built a reputation as one of the most nuanced actors of his generation.,” Roxy also wrote of the breakout “Triangle of Sadness” and “Beach Rats” actor. “With ‘Urchin,' Dickinson steps behind the camera, proving he's just as compelling a storyteller as he is a performer. The film follows a [young man] navigating life on the fringes of society in coastal Britain, balancing harsh realism with poetic introspection. It's a deeply personal work — one that feels both intimate and cinematically ambitious.”

From IndieWire's review of “Urchin”: “Dickinson's lithe and tetchy script only feigns at a clean hero's journey in order to undercut it with the chaos of human behavior, and what might have been a nice three-act story about a moppet on the mend sours into something far less digestible or instructive.”

The series includes films by Agnès Varda, Andrei Tarkovsky, and more. More details below.

“Vagabond” (dir. Agnès Varda)

A portrait of a young woman's solitary journey through rural France, told with Varda's trademark blend of realism and lyricism. Screening Wednesday, September 24 in 35mm.

“Nil by Mouth” (dir. Gary Oldman)

A raw, wrenching look at addiction and violence in South London—gritty, unflinching, and deeply compassionate. Screening Thursday, September 25 in 35mm.

“Andrei Rublev” (dir. Andrei Tarkovsky)

An epic meditation on art, faith, and suffering. Dickinson cites it as a major influence on his sense of rhythm and atmosphere. Screening Friday, September 26 in 35mm.

“Manila in the Claws of Light” (dir. Lino Brocka)

A politically charged neorealist masterpiece that follows a young man navigating poverty, exploitation, and disillusionment in 1970s Manila. Its stark beauty and social urgency resonate deeply with the themes of Urchin. Harris will introduce the Thursday, October 9 screening.

	President Donald Trump cannot pronounce “acetaminophen” — not on the first try, at least. He does, however, feel he is qualified to tell American women that if they take it during pregnancy they might give their children autism.


	The declaration came during a joint press event on Monday. Trump — flanked by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Dr. Mehmet Oz — said that “effective immediately” the Food and Drug Administration “will be notifying physicians that the use of acetaminophen,” commonly sold under the brand name Tylenol, “during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism.” 


	Trump told reporters that he was dispensing vaccine advice based on “common sense” and “what I feel,” and the administration's new guidance on Tylenol similarly does not seem to be based on science. No established link exists between acetaminophen — one of the most common and effective pain and fever reduces in the world — and Autism Spectrum Disorders. The existing body of research is limited, contradictory, and difficult to replicate. The president, who once suggested using bleach to kill Covid-19, and Kennedy, a raw milk evangelist who seems allergic to academic research, are nevertheless charging ahead with the dubious advice. 

	











	“Taking Tylenol is not good,” Trump claimed, contradicting decades of data indicating it is perfectly safe. “Don't take Tylenol. Don't take it. Fight like hell not to take it.” he said, suggesting women simply “tough it out” through pain or fever during pregnancy.

	Kennedy added that “clinical laboratory studies” suggested a “potential association between acetaminophen used during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.”


	Autism researchers and obstetrics experts were appalled. 


	“Paracetamol (acetaminophen) does not cause autism, ADHD, or learning disabilities,” Dr. Monique Botha, associate professor in social and developmental psychology at Durham University, tells Rolling Stone. “That is something that I can confidently say.”

	Botha, whose work and research focuses on Autism Spectrum Disorders, adds that the studies suggesting correlation — not causation — did not control for things like genetics and family history: “As soon as you control for those things, any correlation like that essentially disappears.” It's a reality even the FDA acknowledged in its announcement of the administration's new guidance. “It is important to note that while an association between acetaminophen and neurological conditions has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature,” the FDA wrote in its public statement. 


	Kennedy has, for decades now, promoted claims that vaccines are responsible for increased rates of autism diagnoses in children, a phenomenon experts agree is more closely related to increased awareness and ability to identify the condition. In April, Kennedy publicly vowed to conduct a “massive testing and research effort” through HHS to find the causes of Autism Spectrum Disorders. “By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we'll be able to eliminate those exposures,” Kennedy said at the time.


	Botha notes that the causes of autism have been researched for decades, and largely point to a multi-factor originating largely based on biology — not pharmaceutical exposure. “There's plenty of research, decades of research. If you said I had to nail myself to one answer, I would say that it is primarily genetic and inheritable.”

	What's more concerning in Botha's view is that the administration's description of Autism Spectrum Disorders as an “epidemic” — as something to pin blame for and eliminate — is dehumanizing language that veers into eugenics. 


	“Autistic people are dehumanized, we know that from other research, as well,” Botha says. “This adds to that dehumanization, because it's this obsession with ‘Why do you exist? Why are you here?' It adds to this persistent feeling that autistic people report on, which is that they know that society would rather they did not exist. … Autistic people and their families, are deserving of respect, are deserving of adequate support, this is the last thing those families need” 

	











	Botha notes that the majority of monetary funding for autism research and resources tend to be directed towards finding the mythical single cause of the condition, instead of providing material support to autistic people and their families, or improving the public's understanding of the disorder.  The National Institute of Health on Monday announced a $50 million Autism Data Science Initiative to “unlock the causes and improve outcomes.” 


	Eric Garcia, journalist at The Independent and author of We're Not Broken: Changing the Autism Conversation, tells Rolling Stone that Kennedy is leading a “really a return to the blame game around autism.” 


	“Is it the vaccines? Is it the mold? Is it the Tylenol? It's looking for someone to blame. But that doesn't do anything — that doesn't fix anything for autistic people. If anything, it distracts from the ability to rebuild the world for autistic people and heal the world for them,” Garcia says.


	In the absence of actual science, the president offered up mad-libs rambling falsely insisting that communities that refuse to take “pills” or that avoid vaccines have nonexistent rates of Autism. 


	“I think I can say that there are certain groups of people that don't take any vaccines or don't take any pills that have no autism,” he said on Monday. “You have certain groups, the Amish, as an example, they have essentially no autism.” Trump added that “there's a rumor” that there is “virtually no autism” in Cuba because “they don't have money for Tylenol.” (This is false.)


	It is clear to Garcia that the administration “wanted to find something” to fulfill its public promises, and was willing to throw out whatever they could find — in this case, blaming acetaminophen.


	On Tuesday, the World Health Organization issued a statement clarifying that there is “inconsistent” evidence on the matter, and that the “lack of replicability [for past studies] really calls for caution in drawing casual conclusions.”


	The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), meanwhile, affirmed that they had not changed their recommendations of the use of acetaminophen by pregnant women, and considered it safe. (Last year, researchers at Drexel University conducted a large-scale study of 2.5 million births in Sweden between 1995 to 2019, and found no direct causal risk related to the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy.)


	“Suggestions that acetaminophen use in pregnancy causes autism are not only highly concerning to clinicians but also irresponsible when considering the harmful and confusing message they send to pregnant patients, including those who may need to rely on this beneficial medicine during pregnancy,” ACOD President Steven J. Fleischman wrote in a statement. “Acetaminophen is one of the few options available to pregnant patients to treat pain and fever, which can be harmful to pregnant people when left untreated. … The conditions people use acetaminophen to treat during pregnancy are far more dangerous than any theoretical risks and can create severe morbidity and mortality for the pregnant person and the fetus.” 

	











	In a statement provided to Rolling Stone, Kenvue — the manufacturer of Tylenol — indicated their belief that “independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned about the health risks and confusion this poses for expecting mothers and parents.” 


	“The facts are that over a decade of rigorous research, endorsed by leading medical professionals and global health regulators, confirms there is no credible evidence linking acetaminophen to autism,” Kenvue continued. “We stand with the many public health and medical professionals who have reviewed this science and agree.” 


	Public health experts, research, and medical professionals have long been struggling to compete with outright falsehoods being broadcast at max volume from the most powerful political office on the planet. “It's demoralizing,” Botha says.


	Even more demoralizing than the lies and stigma being promoted by the president may be the callousness with which he presents them. At one point during Monday's press conference, Trump took one of his rhetorical detours into a complaint about Ozempic, which he says he calls “the fat drug,” and how it's cheaper overseas because the U.S. is “subsidizing the rest of the world” but it's “nothing compared to autism.”

One of Ethan Hawke's greatest attributes as an actor is that he makes things look easy. That's not to say that the star doesn't put the work in — you don't get Emmy and Tony nominations, write several books, and direct your own films when you're just coasting.

But since his emergence as a movie star in the '90s, the Austin-born actor has always had a laidback, easygoing vibe that's made his movie star swagger seem effortless and allowed him to sink convincingly into most every part he's ever taken. That attitude made him something of a Gen X icon in his day, when he starred in films like “Reality Bites” and “Before Sunrise.” As he's gotten older, he hasn't lost that sense of cool, but has brought it to older, wiser, and more seasoned characters, like the hip if immature father he brought to life in “Boyhood.” And, when Hawke departs from those types with roles he doesn't seem an obvious fit for, he shows that he's more than capable of shedding that image for something more severe, like with his transformative and stunning work in Paul Schrader's “First Reformed.”

Breaking through with 1989's “Dead Poets Society,” Hawke has also shown himself to have great taste in film roles, constantly choosing interesting projects that have kept him fairly prominent throughout his decades in Hollywood. His most consistent collaborator is Richard Linklater, with whom he first worked with for “Before Sunrise,” eventually co-writing the sequels to the film alongside his co-star Julie Delpy. He also worked with him on “Boyhood,” gaining much acclaim for his performance in the time-hopping coming-of-age drama. Through his career, he's starred in great films, co-wrote quite a few of them, and even directed a few of his own, including “Chelsea Walls,” “The Hottest State,” and the HBO Max documentary series “The Last Movie Stars.” And he's shown that his star power can translate to TV, where's he's given great performances in series like “Moon Knight” and especially “The Good Lord Bird.”

With Hawke starring in the new TV series “The Lowdown,” IndieWire has taken the liberty of going through his filmography to rank the best of his greatest performances. This list includes both movie roles and the rare TV appearance, including his work on “The Good Lord Bird” and “Reservation Dogs.” Read on for Ethan Hawke's 10 best performances, ranked.

A defining text of mid-'90s Gen X disenchantment, “Reality Bites” is not a particularly good movie: the characters are shrill and unlikable, the plot is preachy and basic, and Helen Childress' script has a smug, too-cool-for-school attitude that's aged horrendously after 30 years. Hawke doesn't necessarily escape the film's problems: his character, coffeehouse singer-songwriter Troy, is a thin stereotype of a hot '90s slacker, wildly unlikable despite the film wanting you to fall for him. That said, this is arguably the project that did the most to cement Hawke's star image, and there's undeniably appeal to his soulful, snarky performance, which shows real star quality that's downright nostalgic to see in a Hollywood production these days. His chemistry with Winona Ryder is almost enough to make their characters' romance work, even if the script keeps getting in the way.

An underseen gem, “Born to Be Blue” presents a semi-fictionalized look at the life of famed jazz trumpeter Chet Baker, focusing particularly on his recovery from a mugging incident in the '60s that lead to the destruction of his teeth and damaged his ability to play his beloved instrument. Hawke nearly played a younger version of Baker in a Richard Linklater film that never came to fruition; his performance in Robert Budreau's film is better for the experience and vulnerability he brings to the role with his age, despite his underlying boyish charm. Hawke learned to play the trumpet himself for the role, his inexperience with the instrument working with the context of Baker trying to recover from his accident, and nails a warbling, sensitive performance of the song “I've Never Been in Love Before.” The film doesn't sugercoat any of Baker's faults, from his neediness to his general immaturity, but Hawke is raw and sensitive enough that you want to forgive him all the same.

One of Hawke's most well-remembered films from the '90s, thanks in part to becoming a lazy day in high school science class staple watch, “Gattaca” is also an intelligent and thoughtful warning of the potential impact of eugenics, imagining a future where parents use genetic selection to conceive their children. For Hawke's Vincent Freeman, who was born without any genetic selection, that means a lifetime of discrimination, getting barred from high-paying work and his dreams of going to space being denied. But he gets a chance at a new life when he begins impersonating Jude Law's Jerome Morrow, a swim champion who was paralyzed in an accident. In an often chilly sci-fi film, the earthy Hawke is excellent casting: he's certainly attractive, but almost seems of an entirely different era than the unnaturally beautiful Law, with a wide-eyed sense of wonder that sells Vincent's very earnest dreams. Also, the set of the film is where Hawke met his former wife Uma Thurman, and the two share unsurprisingly great chemistry that gives the film's romance real charge. 

Hawke was just 18 years old when he broke through as the sweet, sensitive Todd in “Dead Poets Society,” Peter Weir's beloved coming-of-age drama about Robin Williams' John Keating, who inspires a group of dissatisfied boarding school boys to “seize the day” and pursue their passions. At his then-young age, the actor has much of the sensitivity that would make him a great performer later on his career, proving very believable as a shy, sheltered teen with low confidence who slowly emerges from his shell. Most importantly, he has excellent chemistry with Robert Sean Leonard as Todd's best friend Neil, developing a sweet friendship that makes the film's ultimate tragedy all the more painful. In an earnest, inspirational tearjerker, it's Hawke's performance that gives the story much of its emotional core.

“Reservation Dogs” is an incredible show for many reasons, with some of the best writing, direction, and acting of any series this decade. One of its greatest attributes, though, is its ability to expand beyond its central cast of four Native teens living on an Oklahoma reservation and flesh out the community around them, leading to a sprawling ensemble where every player has texture and humanity. For its penultimate episode, the show was even able to flex a bit by abandoning nearly the entire cast for a standalone story focusing on Elora (the phenomenal Devery Jacobs) as she locates the father she never met for financial information. Casting a movie star like Hawke in the role could feel like stunt casting, but it never feels like it watching “Elora's Dad”; he sinks into the lowkey, bittersweet tone of the show immediately, never overplaying the emotions that come from this reluctant reconnection. He's excellent with Jacobs in particular, his regretful sweetness contrasting beautifully with her spiky disposition, and making for one of a great show's very best episodes. It's an excellent preview of what Hawke and series creator Sterlin Harjo could accomplish in their followup collaboration “The Lowdown.”

Divisive at the time, and still today, Michael Almereyda's 2000 contemporary version of “Hamlet” is nonetheless one of the most interesting Shakespeare films ever made, transforming the classical tragedy into a paranoia-drenched sort of techno thriller about the evolving technology of the time and the feeling of being constantly under surveillance. Hawke's performance was also a bit divisive, rendering the Prince of Denmark as a mopey-eyed film student and heir to a major corporation, with many critics preferring the rest of the ensemble (most notably Julia Stiles' devastating Ophelia or Kyle MacLachlan's scheming Claudius). But his performance, which emphasizes the more pathetic parts of the Prince's nature, works well in this film's feverish context, sucking out the grandiosity of the character in favor of something petulant and infantile. It's not what you think of when you think of Shakespearean acting, but in a way, it's more honest and insightful about the character than many other renditions you've seen before. And when the film asks him to, Hawke delivers, with a sensitivity that makes Hamlet unmistakably human.

Famously filmed over the course of 11 years with production starting and stopping to track the coming-of-age of its main character, Richard Linklater's “Boyhood” derives a lot of pleasure from seeing how its ensemble of actors evolves over the years. Nowhere is that more evident than with Ethan Hawke's performance as Mason's (Ellar Coltrane) irresponsible, reckless father, semi-estranged from his kids at first after his divorce from their mother. Hawke was 32 with two very young kids of his own when production began; by the time it ended in 2013, he was in his forties, and the experience of raising his own children (and going through his own divorce) clearly seeped into the extra level of tenderness and sweetness he brought to the role. In a poignant film about the passage of time, watching Hawke transform his character from a wash-up to someone Mason can be proud to call his father makes for the most satisfying, moving arc.

Criminally underseen and underappreciated, “The Good Lord Bird” features Hawke playing an undersung American hero, abolitionist John Brown, who raided federal armories in an attempt to begin a slave revolt. Told from the point of view of Onion (Joshua Caleb Johnson), a fictional enslaved boy who joins Brown's soldiers, the show follows Brown's life with plenty of reverence, which could slide into hero-worshipping. But Hawke nails a tricky, difficult part: his Brown is bombastic and theatrical, prone to launching into sermons and speeches at a moment's notice, but with real conviction and purpose behind everything he says, and the actor never winks to the audience or undercuts the real sincere humanity behind Brown's beliefs. It's an astonishingly ferocious portrait of revolutionary fire packed with adrenaline. 

Nothing about the “Before” trilogy of films, Richard Linklater's opus about an American man and a French woman who meet by chance on a train and their two-decade-ish love story, would work if the stars didn't have the type of lightning-in-a-bottle chemistry casting directors dream of. It took the director nine months to finalize casting for the characters of Jesse and Céline for “Before Sunrise,” before he eventually got Hawke and Julie Delpy together for a final reading. In the film that resulted, the two have such a swoony, instant spark that you can understand exactly why they would fall for each other immediately, and both have a perfect handle on the bantering, erudite, circular dialogue that the movie is built upon. Over two sequels, the characters' relationship got to grow more complicated, and it's a joy to see the actors' grow with their characters. Hawke, deep in his dreamy Gen X heartthrob era in the first film, manages to keep the traits that make Jesse unique — his swagger, intelligence, playfulness — while also showing his evolution from immature young man to older, flawed husband. And when Hawke smashes the big blowout fight between Jesse and Céline that “Before Midnight” builds up to out of the park, you get the sense that his younger self from the first film wouldn't have been capable of delivering it.

Hawke, remarkably, was not Oscar-nominated for his performance in “First Reformed,” his finest work as an actor. Had Paul Schrader's morally murky psychological thriller received more critical attention, he very well could have (and probably should have) won. He's that great as Reverend Ernst Toller, the minister of a small historical church in Upstate New York whose worldview is shaken when he provides spiritual council to a radical environmentalist and his pregnant wife. With a deep set brow of worry and stiff body posture, Hawke ably conveys the image of a man haunted by his past actions and with deep convictions for how to repent. With Toller such an internal character, we chart most of his change not through words or actions, but through Hawke's face, how his eyes flash with shock, doubt, anger, and disgust. When Toller makes his final choice at the end of the film, it's thanks to Hawke's work that it's not shocking at all. Few actors have been capable of a performance as spiritually distraught as this.

EXCLUSIVE: Here's your first look at Heated Rivalry, Crave‘s steamy TV drama series. We can also reveal the series will launch in Canada in November.


Heated Rivalry follows a pair of leading Major League Hockey players who harbor a secret: Away from their rivalry on the ice, they are secretly lovers who initially hide their confusing and complicated relationship from the world.


	Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie star as the serious-minded Canadian captain of the Montreal Meteors, and Russian star and playboy Ilya Rozanov of the Boston Raiders, respectively. In the image above, we see them catching a secret moment together. Below, it's them with their sporting hats on, fending questions at a press conference.

	François Arnaud, Robbie GK, Sophie Nélisse, Ksenia Daniela Kharlamova, Dylan Walsh and Christina Chang also star.

	The show comes from Jacob Tierney and Brendan Brady from Accent Aigu Entertainment, who have adapted author Rachel Reid's novels charting the love affair. “Their connection feels so real, as Rachel allowed for this complicated dynamic that grows over seven years,” Tierney told Deadline in an exclusive interview.


	Tierney and Brady are among the hottest producers in Canadian TV right now, coming off Letterkenny and Shoresy. They optioned the book before writing a pilot on spec and selling the idea to Crave.


	Bell Media streamer commissioned the series earlier this year, with Bell's General Manager of Original Programming Carlyn Klebuc saying it was “going to be buzzy,” and the Canadian giant's VP of Content Development & Programming, Justin Stockman, adding it was “a very big swing.” Sphere Abacus, the Bell-owned sales house, is shopping the series at MIPCOM Cannes next month.

Done with the blessing of Major League Baseball, the collection spans apparel, accessories and equipment with a launch scheduled at select Kith stores and on the brand's website on Friday, Sept. 26.

	George Costanza is back with the New York Yankees.


Jason Alexander, who played the beloved curmudgeon on the iconic comedy series Seinfeld, has found himself a new role by headlining a campaign for Kith in partnership with the New York Yankees. Done with the blessing of Major League Baseball, the collection spans apparel, accessories and equipment with artwork in honor of the World Series champs. The line launches at select Kith stores and on the brand's website on Friday, Sept. 26.




	Kith founder and creative director Ronnie Fieg is a big sports fan and has previously partnered on other collections with the Yankees, the NFL and the New York Knicks in addition to other collaborations with Wilson, Adidas, Russell Athletic, Nike and more. The fashion house jump-started this new line by introducing collectible made-to-order printed bats featuring the Yankees logo made by Kith and Victus. Two natural bats retail for $245 while a Kith and Swarovski version retails for $5,000.

	Alexander is outfitted in apparel from the Kith for the New York Yankees line, a range that includes a coaches jacket, a pinehurst sherpa jacket, a Nelson crewneck, novelty outerwear with all-over logo patches and co-branded artwork, like on a corduroy avery bomber jacket, the brixton puffed shirt jacket, and the wyona full-zip. Also included are classic hoodies, pullovers and sweatshirts.

	Alexander also models a flight jacket done in partnership with Avirex, available in three iterations, including one with all-over Cooperstown collective patchwork and embroidery with each World Series Championship year, another designed in Kith's staple nocturnal hue with python-printed accents, and one designed in the Yankees team colors with genuine MLB logo artwork.


	See a selection of the pieces on Alexander in the new campaign below. Seinfeld fans will remember that Alexander's Costanza landed a dream job with the team during season five, as he was hired as the assistant to the traveling secretary. He wound up having a long tenure with the team, which was featured prominently through season eight, as Costanza regularly appeared in his office and around George Steinbrenner, played by the show's co-creator Larry David.

Kimmel's emotional and highly anticipated return to ABC is racking up views and should soon become the most popular 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' monologue on YouTube. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


Nexstar and Sinclair really missed out. 


	The affiliate groups boycotting Jimmy Kimmel Live! missed airing — and selling ads — on what could become Jimmy Kimmel's most-watched monologue in many years, if not ever. 




Kimmel's return to ABC on Tuesday night (watch the video, below) featured a nearly 30-minute show opening that included the host's emotional monologue where he thanked those who supported him during his suspension, attempted to clarify his controversial comments about Charlie Kirk and, most of all, passionately defended free speech.

					Jimmy Kimmel Returns With Gratitude for Supporters, Barbs for "Anti-American" Calls to Silence Him		
			









	So far, the show's official YouTube account has clocked the monologue video at 13 million views in just 14 hours. Kimmel has many short clips from his show of sketches and guest interview segments that have racked up tens of millions of clicks over the years, but Tuesday night's monologue is looking like it might set a record in terms of opening monologue videos.


	Kimmel's current most-watched opening monologue is from another sober occasion — Kimmel discussing the details of his son's birth and heart disease from eight years ago. That has 14 million views. In second place currently is Kimmel's break down of the Will Smith Oscars slap from three years ago. Other popular monologues include Kimmel discussing the 2017 mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas (10 million views), and Kimmel reacting to President Trump's election last November (9 million views).

	











	Given that Kimmel's latest is averaging about 1 million views an hour, it certainly seems likely that last night's opening will soon break the host's monologue record. 


	On ABC, Kimmel typically draws about 1.6 million viewers, but according to The New York Times, the network is expecting to generate far more than that in the official ratings— even with the Nexstar and Sinclair boycotts, which account for roughly 20 percent of the network's stations.


	Kimmel's monologue is largely being hailed as meeting the moment. While he stopped just short of apologizing for his comments about Kirk — something many on the right were demanding — he attempted to reach out to his detractors by thanking the many conservatives who criticized the Trump administration's efforts to push him off the air, as well as gave very sincere-sounding praise to Kirk's widow Erika Kirk, and expressed some hope for some measure of increased bipartisan unity in the wake of recent events.


	“Look, I never imagined I would be in a situation like this,” Kimmel said. “I barely paid attention in school. One thing I did learn from from Lenny Bruce and George Carlin and Howard Stern, is that a government threat to silence a comedian the President doesn't like is anti American. So I'm glad we have some solidarity on that from the right and left and from those in the middle — like Joe Rogan. Maybe the silver lining from this is we found one thing we can agree on … Let's stop letting these politicians tell us what they want and tell them what we want.”

	











	For more, here's a recap of Kimmel's comments and a Hollywood Reporter‘s critic's take on the monologue.

	Four months after news broke that she and Jason Isbell were divorcing, Amanda Shires opened a pair of concerts for Isbell in Colorado. The singer-songwriter, who addresses the end of her marriage and the reclamation of her independence on her new album, Nobody's Girl, says she played the gigs simply because she always keeps her word.


	“They were booked early on and confirmed, and the deals were inked, as they say,” Shires tells Rolling Stone on this week's Nashville Now podcast. “I always do what I say I'm going to do, always.”

A post shared by Rolling Stone Nashville Now (@rscountry)


	Onstage at Red Rocks Amphitheatre on night one in May 2024, Shires changed the words to her song “Stupid Love” to allude to her now-ex-husband's dental work. She says she wasn't jabbing at him, but rather making an observation that Shires says was overblown.


	“Some of the things I said on that first show were kind of taken out of context. And Jason was there and he knew what I said and how things came across. They got sensationalized,” she says.

	











	“When I sang that song ‘Stupid Love' … I changed it that night to ‘You're smiling so much you kissed me with your crooked teeth,'” she continues. “They thought I was making fun of him, but I was trying to make a separation, like, I never kissed the new teeth — I kissed the old teeth.”

	Shires releases Nobody's Girl on Friday, Sept. 26. “The past two years of my life have made it to where I feel like I can talk about anything, at this point,” she told Rolling Stone earlier this year. “I have always used music as a way to explain what's going on in my life to myself. And it was a big transition to go from, you know, having been in a marriage for a long time and to suddenly find that I'm not. It takes a lot of learning and self-reflection and, for me, a lot of time to process.”

	The Rolling Stones are going back to the vault for a refresh of their landmark 13th studio album, Black and Blue. The group will celebrate the 1976 LP with an upcoming definitive Super Deluxe box set due out on Nov. 14 through Interscope/UMe featuring six previously unreleased songs.

Black and Blue marked a turning point for the band following the departure of former guitarist Mick Taylor, who was eventually replaced by Ronnie Wood. As the band searched for Taylor's replacement, they brought a series of guitar greats in to perform on the LP, including Canned Heat guitarist Harvey Mandel, songwriter and session great Wayne Perkins, as well as Yardbirds wiz Jeff Beck and Memphis blues guitarist Robert A. Johnson.

	Wood would later join the band full-time, appearing on three tracks on the Billboard 200 album chart-topping LP, which mixes reggae, funk and soul into the Stones' signature mix on songs including “Hot Stuff,” “Fool to Cry,” “Memory Motel” and “Melody.”

	











	The box set will feature a six-track disc of previously unreleased songs, including Mick Jagger/Keith Richards composition “I Love Ladies,” a cover of Shirley & Company's “Shame, Shame, Shame” and four instrumental jams from the 1975 sessions with the guest guitarists; a new video for “Shame, Shame, Shame” will debut on Thursday (Sept. 25) directed by Dutch filmmaker Camille Boumans. The box will include a full live concert from the band's six-night residency at London's Earls Court Exhibition Centre. 


	The accompanying Blu-ray disc adds a previously unreleased TV broadcast of the Stones' 1976 show at Les Abattoirs in Paris, as well as Dolby Atmos surround sound mixes of the studio album and the live Earls Court concert. 


	Producer Andrew Watt recently told Rolling Stone magazine that he's working with the Stones again on what could be the follow-up to their Grammy-winning 24th studio album, 2023's Hackney Diamonds. Without revealing many details, Watt said, “I've said it before, but it's like working for Batman…when the tongue is up in the air, you just go… I can say we did some recording together, but that's all I can say.”

River Cartwright is a mess. Or that's what people keep telling him, anyway.

Following last season's reunion-spoiling revelations about his father (ex-CIA operative Frank Harkness) and his father's past (raising children to be super-soldiers), the galloping young stallion (played by Jack Lowden) hasn't been able to screw his head on straight. Lamb (Gary Oldman) unfavorably compares him to a “crack-up, a drunk, [and] a psychopath.” Standish (Saskia Reeves) reprimands River for not dealing with his issues as well as he could (a.k.a. her version of Lamb's blistering reproach). And Louisa (Rosalind Eleazar) lays it out as plainly as can be: “You're a mess,” she says. “You're not allowing yourself to feel things that you should be feeling.”

 








Related Stories Jimmy Kimmel Made Himself Unassailable — Will That Be Enough? One Volcano After Another: Designing a Legendary Battle Sequence for the ‘Chief of War' Finale 

But River doesn't see it, and frankly, neither do we. Sure, he snaps at Shirley (Aimee-Ffion Edwards) for no good reason, and yeah, his instincts aren't as attuned as one would hope. (He makes an obviously errant pass at the worst possible moment.) But River has always been rough around the edges. His blunt bullheadedness is part of what landed him in Slough House, MI5's storage locker for damaged agents, but it's also what's helped the haphazard team save the day, time and again, season after season.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






So what's the truth? Is River in desperate need of some R&R, or is everyone else projecting their own predicaments onto him? Well, after five seasons of Will Smith's savvy Apple series, there's little question as to who's right in this regard: It's Lamb. Our foul, flatulent father-figure may exaggerate a bit when belittling his enemies (and friends, for that matter), but cloaked under his aura of filth — like an adult Pig-Pen's toxic dust cloud — rests a core truth. So as soon as Lamb backs a team he's wont to disagree with, any mystery around River's mental health status is settled: He's a mess.

Even with one false impression exposed, splits in perception become a running theme of Season 5. When Roddy (Christopher Chung) almost gets hit by a van, Shirley claims she saved him from an intentional attack. But Roddy argues she was just “looking for an excuse to sexually harass me” and demands reimbursement for his damaged clothes. Is someone trying to kill him, or is Shirley's personal loss (Marcus, last season) making her paranoid? Later, Roddy needs to look his best for a date with a woman way out of his league, yet his inflexible ego — and a cozy night at the club — make their shared passions seem weirdly plausible. Did Roddy, of all people, find love, or is she… being paid for her services (as his peers repeatedly contend)? 

 










Distinguishing the appearance of truth from truth itself isn't limited to individuals, either. Season 5 is set in a country gone “fucking mad.” When a campaign volunteer for the mayor gets killed by a gunman who supports the opposition, investigators prepare for the ramifications of a political attack. But when it turns out the shooter — who police initially believed had taken his own life — was, in fact, shot by someone else, the assumed situation spawns question after question: Who? When? Why?

As more strange situations sweep London, our favorite scruffy spies must decide what, who, and how much to believe. Is this a particularly bad week, filled with normal crises at an abnormal pace, or is there some sort of grand conspiracy connecting each bizarre emergency? Who among them should they listen to (besides Lamb), and whose vision is being clouded by personal bias? But also, how much is too much? If one far-fetched theory is proven credible, what other previously disregarded ideas merit reconsideration?

Invigorating in its temerity, Smith's six-episode Season 5 is told with propulsive clarity (save for the mysteries you're intended to guess at). Chaos is sorted into appreciable story arcs without diluting its overwhelming effect on our heroes. The element of chance isn't treated as a convenient plot device, nor is it pushed aside entirely so a grand plan can click into place. Best of all, Slough House's ability to make sense of the senseless becomes their key to saving the day. We may not always be able to separate reality from perception — sometimes differing perceptions simply can't coexist — but we can still respect and value actual intelligence, especially when it's used to solve public problems. 

 










Problems “Slow Horses” directly links to anti-intellectualists, ignorant bullies, and willful distorters of the historical record — natural enemies of any self-respecting spy. They don't call them intelligence agents for nothing, and Season 5 is a nice reminder of their basic function: not only to know more than your Average Joe, but to apply that knowledge toward keeping the peace. 

River, very much looking the part of an internet boyfriend on the rise, is a mess, and Lamb, the living embodiment of “don't judge a book by his cover,” makes for the perfect person to call him out. If we can all agree the clean-cut, handsome kid is more mixed-up than the slovenly old man about to clear the room with his farts, then maybe there's hope yet for a shared reality rooted in truth. Fingers crossed.

“Slow Horses” Season 5 premieres Wednesday, September 24 on Apple TV+. New episodes will be released weekly through the finale on October 29. The series has been renewed through Season 7.

The special release also features stripped-down versions of classics including "Cast No Shadow," "Wonderwall" and "Champagne Supernova."

	For a band that has not released a proper new song in 16 years, any fresh Oasis content is like manna from heaven for the band's die-hard fans. Especially if it's a refresh of one of their all-time classics.


	On Wednesday morning (Sept. 24) the reunited Britpop icons dropped “Morning Glory (Unplugged),” a thrilling, stripped-down version of the title track from their 1995 sophomore album, (What's the Story) Morning Glory? The song, which appears on the upcoming (What's the Story) Morning Glory? 30th anniversary deluxe edition (Oct. 3), was produced and mixed by guitarist/songwriter Noel Gallagher and Callum Marinho from the original master recordings at Noel's London studio, Lone Star Sound. 

	











	The acoustic guitar and tambourine jam puts the focus directly on singer Liam Gallagher's urgent vocals until a mid-song piano break that adds a jazzy interlude to the otherwise driving, stripped-down arrangement. At press time no information was available on when the unplugged version was recorded or who performs on it.




			Trending on Billboard		







	In addition to the title track refresh, the 30th anniversary Morning Glory edition will feature unplugged versions of four other classics from the album, including “Cast No Shadow,” “Wonderwall,” “Champagne Supernova” and the previously released live favorite B-side “Acquiesce.”

	











	After a triumphant North American swing, Oasis will continue their sold-out reunion tour at London's Wembley Stadium on Saturday (Sept. 27) and Sunday (Sept. 28), returning to the famed venue where they played to more than 400,000 over a five-night stand in July and early August.


	The tour will then move on to a series of shows in South Korea and Japan in late October before a run of five concerts in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia and a wind-down series of November gigs in Buenos Aires, Argentina and São Paulo, Brazil.

Hootie and the Blowfish frontman Darius Rucker has formed a supergroup, Howl Owl Howl, with R.E.M. bassist Mike Mills and co-founding, former drummer for the Black Crowes, Steve Gorman. Their debut track “My Cologne” arrives Oct. 31, and they're kicking off their inaugural tour Nov. 3 at the Vogue in Indianapolis, Indiana.


	“It feels great to be singing with a rock band again,” Rucker says in a statement. “It's like buddies getting together, but also getting to play with your idols. The stuff we're writing is so different than anything I've tried to do before.”


	Mills shares Rucker's excitement. “You never can explain band chemistry,” he says. “We all like each other. And we all admire each other musically. All those things come together and if it weren't fun, we wouldn't be doing it.”


	According to a press release, the group's music “fuses organic roots rock with an open-minded alternative flair, matching a fluid, feel-oriented rhythm section to the barrel-chested vocal rasp of an iconic frontman.”

	











	The group started with informal jam sessions back in 2021, but it remained a secret until Rucker discussed it with Rolling Stone‘s Brian Hiatt last summer.

	“You can call it a supergroup if you want, but I think people will really be surprised at how good it is,” Rucker said. “But we're just a band. We're friends, and we jammed together one day at Steve's kid's school with [Nashville session player] Tom Bukovac playing guitar. We were just like, ‘Let's go in the studio and see what happens.' And we went in the studio and to be honest with you, magic happened, and then I just can't wait for the record to get out.'”

	











	There's still no word on when the album will hit, but they'll definitely be playing songs from it on their tour. Their sets will mix Howl Owl Howl originals with songs by R.E.M., the Black Crowes, and Hootie and the Blowfish.

	“There's not a single guarantee,' Gorman says in a statement. “We're finally going to get to plug in and let it rip a little bit.”


	Rucker is no stranger to the R.E.M. catalog. Hootie and the Blowfish have played “Losing My Religion” at most of their concerts over the past two decades. They've also played “(Don't Go Back to) Rockville,” and “It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine).” And a handful of times, they've also done “She Talks to Angels” by the Black Crowes.


	Hootie and the Blowfish played a special show at the Grand Wailea resort in Maui, Hawaii, on Feb. 26. But they've been off the road since last year, and likely won't be touring again any time soon.

	“It would be five or more years — if we ever do it again,” he told Rolling Stone in the middle of the 2024 tour. “I was surprised I agreed to this tour. Because I mean, for me, it's just like, I'm going backwards. You know, as an artist, sometimes you don't want to go backwards.”

McLachlan, who canceled a red carpet performance for her Lilith Fair doc earlier this week out of apparent solidarity with Kimmel, appeared on Tuesday's (Sept. 23) show.


Sarah McLachlan was the musical guest on Tuesday night's (Sept. 23) very special episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!


	The late-night talk show returned to the airwaves a week after ABC pulled the plug following criticism of Kimmel's comments on the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk from the leader of the Federal Communications Commission and Donald Trump.


	McLachlan performed “Better Broken,” the title track from the three-time Grammy Award-winning Canadian artist's first studio album in more than a decade. Seated at a grand piano with dramatic mood lighting giving the set an ethereal glow, McLachlan sang, “Maybe if I catch my breath/ Maybe if I wait a little/ I'd remember how it hurts/ And stop before I fall/ I'd forget to come apart/ And catch myself and hold on tightly.”


	The emotional ballad about accepting romantic heartbreak in which she pledges to “forgive, but not forget,” was pitch perfect for an emotional evening in which Kimmel was frequently near tears during his monologue, in which he described his tumultuous week and the fall-out from his Kirk jokes. 

	











	McLachlan — who is doing the promo rounds for her equally moving ABC News doc Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery — was also a fitting choice because over the weekend the singer appeared to make a gesture of solidarity with Kimmel by refusing to perform at the doc's premiere. “I've grappled with being here tonight and around what to say about the present situation that we are all faced with,” she said in a statement at the premiere. “The stark contraction to the many advances we've made watching the insidious erosion of women's rights, of trans and queer rights, the muzzling of free speech.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	“So happy that Jimmy Kimmel is back on the air and even happier to be performing on Jimmy Kimmel Live TONIGHT!,” McLachlan wrote in a social post before her appearance.  


	Due out Friday, Sept. 19 through Concord Records, Better Broken has been described as “a soul-searching reflection on the fortitude that comes from weathering life's constant storms.”


	The album was primarily recorded at the legendary Sound City Studios in Los Angeles. The Halifax native enlisted help from esteemed musicians including drummer Matt Chamberlain (Bob Dylan, David Bowie) and pedal-steel guitarist Greg Leisz (Kacey Musgraves, Florence + the Machine) and expanded her creative circle by collaborating with producers Tony Berg and Will Maclellan, both known for their work with the indie pop super-trio boygenius.

EXCLUSIVE: Rebel Wilson is back in the director's chair amid the volcanic dispute over her debut feature The Deb.


	Wilson, star of Pitch Perfect and Bridesmaids, will write, direct, produce, and star in comedy Girl Group. Production is underway in the UK with an ensemble cast including Randall Park  (WandaVision) and BAFTA-winner Sheridan Smith (Mrs Biggs).


	Produced by Live Nation Studios (A Star is Born) and Future Artists Entertainment (Poker Face), Wilson stars in Girl Group as a pop diva who's been kicked out of her own group's reunion tour and slapped with a community service court order.

	She seizes the chance to stage a comeback by coaching a group of misfit teen girls for a major record label audition, only to push them too far, forcing her to confront her toxic industry — and her own streak of self-destruction.

Deadline first reported on Girl Group in 2019 when it was housed at Lionsgate, though the film has shifted focus considerably after it was originally announced as a story about a Korean American high school girl who enters a talent contest to perform alongside a K-pop band.


	Wilson's first feature, The Deb, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival last year, but remains unreleased amid a messy legal wrangle between the Australian star and the film's British producers. Up next for Wilson is Tinsel Town, a Sky Original Cinema holiday film co-starring Kiefer Sutherland, which is also being produced by Future Artists Entertainment.

	











Girl Group‘s other cast members include Jamie Lee O'Donnell (Derry Girls) and Guz Khan (The Gentlemen). Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts, Spice Girl Melanie Chisholm, and All Saints' Shaznay Lewis will form the band Girlfriends alongside Wilson's character. Loren Gray will also star.


	Producers conducted a nationwide search across the U.S. to discover the young leads who will play the teen girl group coached by Wilson. Their names are yet to be announced. Wicked choreographer Chris Scott is also on board.


	The film is produced by Wilson under her Camp Sugar banner, alongside Matt Williams of Future Artists Entertainment. Ryan Kroft and Michael Rapino executive produce for Live Nation Studios.


	Wilson described Girl Group as the “ultimate girl power movie.” She added: “Ever since being a part of the Pitch Perfect franchise, I've always wanted to create something similar. Girl Group is just so fun and full of spirit that's ready to have you singing and dancing out of the cinema.”


	Kroft said the feature hopes to capture the “timeless magic of a girl group,” while Williams added that it was a “true celebration of girl power.”


	Wilson is represented by UTA; Tavistock Wood in the UK; Creative Representation in Australia, and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern.

Gavin Newsom appeared on The Late Show last night and took the opportunity to reflect the attention he's been getting for his social media posts, which parody those of Donald Trump.


	Host Stephen Colbert asked Newsom why he decides to do “something kind of funny” with his communication strategy. “The strategy is inspiration/desperation,” Newsom explained. “The two driving forces of life. Everything we were doing to try to break through wasn't working any more. And so we decided to do something, to your point, novel called humor. And, I gotta say, often times Democrats, we're a little — we're not as humorous as we should be. We can be a little stiff. And so we thought we'd have some fun with it.” 


	He added, “I never imagined it would break through like it has and get under the skin of the president of the United States. And some of my friends.” 


	Newsom explained that many on the right have been outraged by his approach because “we put a mirror up to Trump and the absurdity of what's going on in this country. The absurdity of Donald Trump. The absurdity of these networks playing into it.” 

	











	Colbert asked Newsom why he thinks people are engaged by his communication. “What do you think people are responding to?” Colbert inquired.

	“Just the fight,” Newsom replied. “This has been a tough time. A lot of anxiety, a lot of stress, a lot of folks that honestly just don't know if we're going to get our country back. And I get it.” He acknowledged there's a “weakness” that dominates the Democrats' brand. “What people appreciate is that we're willing to fight,” Newsom said. “And not only fight symbolically, by having a little bit of fun, but fight substantively. We have 41 lawsuits against this son of a bitch. We are pushing back.”

Jimmy Kimmel Live returned last night after a week-long suspension, much to the delight of the general public. One person who was not a fan, however, was Donald Trump. 


	The president responded to Jimmy Kimmel's comeback with a rant on Truth Social, declaring that he intends to sue the late-night show's network. “I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back,” Trump wrote. “The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‘talent' was never there.”


	He continued, “Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who's not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE. He is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers! Let Jimmy Kimmel rot in his bad Ratings.”

	











	Last week, ABC and Disney abruptly suspended the long-running late-night series, citing an “ill-timed and thus insensitive” monologue in which the comedian criticized right-wingers for trying to “score political points” off the murder of Charlie Kirk. Jimmy Kimmel kept quiet in the days that followed, while Hollywood raised its voice on his behalf.

	During his monologue last night, Kimmel thanked his many supporters, including “the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway.” He acknowledged, emotionally, that “it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man.”

	











	The host also criticized the Trump administration's attempts to pull him from the air. “I barely paid attention in school, but one thing I did learn from Lenny Bruce and George Carlin and Howard Stern is that a government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn't like is anti-American,” he said. “And I am so glad we have some solidarity on that from the right and the left and from those in the middle, like Joe Rogan, maybe the silver lining from this is we found one thing we can agree on, and maybe we'll even find another one. Maybe we can get a little bit closer together.”

	With Jimmy Kimmel Live, FCC chairman Brendan Carr claimed that Kimmel was attempting to push the narrative that Kirk's shooter “was somehow a MAGA or Republican-motivated person,” again calling it “sick.” Carr's contributions to the fragmented framing of the monologue allowed the pressure campaign from the Trump administration, as well as conservatives in the media, to take deeper root.

	Kimmel and Trump have had a long-standing feud, and both often take shots at each other publicly. Last year while hosting the Oscars, Kimmel read one of Trump's Truth Social posts during the ceremony, quipping, “Thank you, President Trump. Thank you for watching, I'm surprised you're still up — isn't it past your jail time?” Trump later called Kimmel a “dope” and “one of the dumbest human beings ever.”


	In April, Kimmel told Rolling Stone he enjoys amping Trump up. “I think most comedians have a strong sense of justice, and he violates that so frequently,” Kimmel said. “I know we should be hardened to it by now, but I'm not. It is shocking to me; it seems like a comic-book villain. He seems like the kind of character that would flame out after a few years, but the fact that he's still with us is remarkable. A year ago, I would've said I'm hoping to show people who aren't paying attention to the news what's actually going on, and hoping to change things that way. Obviously, that didn't have enough impact before the election, so now I see myself more as a place to scream.”

Tuesday night, September 23, marked Jimmy Kimmel's return to the air after Jimmy Kimmel Live! was pulled by ABC last week under pressure from the Trump administration. Kimmel had made a joke about the man alleged to have shot and killed right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, prompting Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair Brendan Carr to threaten the network, which is owned by the Walt Disney Company, with retaliation. Find Kimmel's complete opening monologue from his return below.

Kimmel took the stage to cheers of “Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!” He began by remarking, “I'm not sure who had a weirder 48 hours, me or the CEO of Tylenol,” and expressed his gratitude to his fellow late-night talk show hosts and the audience for their support. Kimmel made a point to thank conservative pundits and politicians including Ben Shapiro, Candace Owens, and Texas Senator Ted Cruz by name: “Even though I don't agree with many of those people on most subjects—some of the things they say even make me want to throw up—it takes courage for them to speak up against this administration, and they did and they deserve credit for it.”

Kimmel continued, “I do want to make something clear because it's important to me as a human, and that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man.” He also acknowledged CBS' recent cancellation of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. “I've had the opportunity to meet and spend time with comedians and talk show hosts from countries like Russia, countries in the Middle East,” Kimmel remarked. “Our freedom to speak is what they admire most about this country, and that's something I'm embarrassed to say I took for granted until they pulled my friend Stephen off the air and tried to coerce the affiliates who run our show in the cities you live in to take my show off the air. That's not legal; that's not American—that's un-American.”

At one point, Kimmel quoted a 2022 social media post from Brendan Carr during his tenure as FCC commissioner: “Political satire is one of the oldest and most important forms of free speech. It challenges those in power while humor to draw more people into the discussion. That's why people in influential positions have always targeted it for censorship.” A later segment featured Robert De Niro loosely impersonating the now-FCC chair—a reference to De Niro's role in Martin Scorsese's 1990 mob drama Goodfellas and a recent comment from Cruz comparing Carr to a “mafioso.”

Addressing his current relationship with the network, Kimmel said, “We talked it through, and, at the end, even though they didn't have to… they welcomed me back on the air. Unfortunately, and, I think, unjustly, this puts them at risk. The president of the United States made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs.” He concluded his monologue by discussing the speech given by Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, during a memorial service organized by Turning Point USA, the conservative organization the late activist co-founded: “On Sunday, Erika Kirk forgave the man who shot her husband. That is an example we should follow. If you believe in the teachings of Jesus, as I do, there it was. That's it. A selfless act of grace, forgiveness from a grieving widow. It touched me deeply. It touches many, and, if there's anything we should take from this tragedy to carry forward, it should be that, and not this.”

Notably, this evening's episode of Kimmel did not air on all ABC stations nationwide. The TV station groups Sinclair and Nexstar, which together control over 20 percent of the network's local affiliates, had previously announced that they would pre-empt the show indefinitely on their programming schedules. Nexstar is currently trying to close a $6.2 billion merger with a rival TV company that will require FCC approval.

Sarah McLachlan was the musical guest on Kimmel tonight. She performed a solo piano rendition of the title track from the new album Better Broken. McLachlan recently canceled her scheduled performance at the premiere event for Disney+'s Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery documentary, which took place on Sunday, September 21, “in support of free speech.” Watch her sing “Better Broken” below.

Jimmy Kimmel returned to ABC's late-night line-up tonight—well, in some markets. Though FCC Chair Brendan Carr's comments last week have inspired Sinclair and Nexstar broadcast groups to continue preempting Kimmel's show, the host delivered a heartfelt and, dare we say, historic monologue to the rest of America. Those serviced by Sinclair and Nexstar will have to search it out on YouTube.

Kimmel received a hero's welcome at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood as he rattled off the names of people who offered words of support to the comedian. Late-night hosts from around the world reached out to Kimmel, who got a job offer from a German late-night show. “This country has become so authoritarian,” Kimmel said, “That Germans are like, ‘Come here. Come here.'”



But while many reached out to Kimmel with kind words, the host had even kinder ones for those who were not fans. “I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” he said. A choked-up Kimmel delivered conciliatory comments to those who took offense to the comments that got him pulled from the air.

“I have no illusions about changing anyone's mind, but I do want to make something clear because it's important to me as a human,” he said. “It was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man. I don't think there's anything funny about it. I posted a message on Instagram the day he was killed, asking for compassion, and I meant it.”

“It was never my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what was obviously a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make, but I understand that to some, it felt either insensitive or unclear, or maybe both. For those who think I pointed a finger, I get why you're upset.”

Kimmel also took a moment to thank Disney for creating space for a show that could potentially catch the ire of the federal government for the last 23 years, while also making light of the consumer revolt in the wake of Kimmel's suspension. Not to mention, he thanked his viewers for the revolt and demanded that those same people show up for Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers should the president target them.

He was less gracious toward FCC Chair Brendan Carr, whom he characterized as “the most embarrassing car Republicans have embraced” since the Cybertruck. He pointed out Carr and Trump's blatant hypocrisy and the betrayal of their so-called free speech ideals. “The President of the United States made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs,” Kimmel said. “Our leader celebrates Americans losing their jobs because he can't take a joke.”

That's not to say the monologue was all Kimmel choking back tears and setting records straight—though there was plenty of that. He also continued his tradition of saying things that would irritate the president. Namely, after a week of claiming that Kimmel has “no ratings.” Kimmel's response: “Well, I do tonight.”

“You almost have to feel sorry for him,” said Kimmel. “He tried his best to cancel me. Instead, he forced millions of people to watch the show. That backfired bigly. He might have to release the Epstein files to distract us from this.”

Kimmel got down to the tricky business of monologuing, and at times held back tears.

	Lars Brandle



Jimmy Kimmel is back, and he's not backing down.


	The late-night host's regular show Jimmy Kimmel Live! was sensationally pulled from the airwaves by ABC last week, following criticism of his comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk – and pressure from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr.


	A week is a lifetime in commercial television. Kimmel's suspension officially lifted with the return of his show Tuesday night, Sept. 23, and he wasted no time in resuming his merciless teasing of America's conservative media and politicians, particularly President Donald Trump.

Jimmy Kimmel Live! opened with a montage of pundits, on both ends of the political spectrum, discussing both Kimmel's return to our screens and his highly-anticipated opening monologue.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Would Kimmel double-down on his Republican jibes? Would he tease Trump? Would he call for free speech? Would he respond to the criticism of his Kirk comments? Yes, to all of it.


	But first, a timely joke. “I'm not sure who had a weirder 48 hours,” he remarked, “me or the CEO of Tylenol,” a reference to the bizarre claim made by President Trump and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that the pain-killing drug was linked to autism.


	He then got down to the tricky business of monologuing, and at times held back tears.

	











	Kimmel thanked his many friends and supporters who checked in, including his “childhood heroes” David Letterman and David Stern, and an unlikely co-sign from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who has publicly reiterated Americans' right to freedom of speech.


	“It takes courage for them to speak out against this administration,” Kimmel responded. “They did and they deserve credit for it. And thanks for telling their followers that our government cannot be allowed to control what we do and do not say on television. And that we have to stand up to it.”


	On Kirk, he remarked: “I have no illusions about changing anyone's mind, but I do want to make something clear, because it's important to me as a human and that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man. I don't think there's anything funny about it.”


	He added, “Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what it was obviously a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make.” To some, he continued, it “felt either ill-timed or unclear or maybe both.”


	This show, he continued, is not important. “What is important is that we get live in a country that allows us to have a show like this.”


	Kimmel also rounded on the ABC affiliates who took down his show. “That's not legal. That's not American. That is un-American and it's so dangerous.” The veteran broadcaster also gave a jab or eight to Trump, noting that the president's gloating remarks about Kimmel's suspension had generated enormous interest in the show. “You almost have to feel sorry for him. He tried to do his best to cancel me, instead he forced millions of people to watch the show. That backfired bigly,” he quipped. “He might have to release the Epstein files to distract us from this now.”


	In a rant on his Truth Social platform before the episode aired, Trump attacked frequent target Kimmel again, making what appeared to be a thinly-veiled threat to “test ABC out on this.” In his post, Trump wrote, “I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something happening between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‘talent' was never there.”

	











	The president then continued to make claims about what he said was overwhelmingly negative coverage of his administration. “Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who's not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE,” he wrote. “He is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers! Let Jimmy Kimmel rot in his bad Ratings.”

The four-time Grammy-nominated singer, songwriter and producer speaks with The Hollywood Reporter about his creative process and no. 1 songwriting essential: "I take it everywhere I go."

	Peel back Charlie Puth‘s perfect pitch, nine multi-platinum singles and 35 billion+ career streams, and you've got a guy who wholeheartedly lives and breathes music.


	The singer, songwriter and producer catches up with The Hollywood Reporter about what he's been working on, life on the go (he travels back and forth between Los Angeles and New York) and his very fitting partnership with Bic pens (he handwrites all his lyrics). He also breaks down his creative process, backstage must-haves and what he's most looking forward to in the coming months (hint: it involves new music).

Let's jump right in. Tell me about your songwriting process. Is it always the same or different based on where you are in life or what you're writing?


	I mean, it's different everywhere because life is different every day. I'll write different sounding music based on the location. I remember writing “We Don't Talk Anymore” in the Philippines, and it was a very hot day. It was probably 100 degrees… Fahrenheit, not Celsius (Laughs). I saw palm trees, and I thought to myself very simply, “I'm going to make a song that feels like vacation, sounds like vacation.” This is before the lyrics were written, of course.


	And then, “Light Switch,” the song I put out in 2022, was a result of me just being locked in the studio because of post-COVID times, and I wanted something upbeat and fast to kind of get me going because nothing at that point in time was. I wanted to make something that excited me.


Can you elaborate on your physical writing process?


	I handwrite lyrics. I never type lyrics on my phone or a computer. It just feels like the song isn't a song if I type it in — it needs my personality. It's just something mental. Bic produces a product that I literally use every day of my life to make music: the 4-Color Pen. The different colors will trigger different parts of my musical mind. So I take it on tour. I take it on airplanes. I take it everywhere I go. If I don't like a lyric, I'm going to use the color red to scratch it out. Red's bad. Green's my favorite color. Green means go. That's usually a good lyric.

	











Other than your pen, what are your must-have travel items?


	I'm a really basic traveler. Bose headphones. I have my iPad. I have my neck pillow. And there's this little pocket synthesizer by Teenage Engineering that I use. I've never recorded with it, but it's just like little blips and bleeps… I draft what could be ideas on it.


Side note: I just noticed that your Zoom name is “MusicRocks1991.”


	Yeah, you can write that in the article too because music does rock.


I'm fully writing that in the article. OK, so we did travel, but do you have any backstage essentials?


	Several notebooks and pens. I have to have a little keyboard backstage as well because I feel like sometimes I can't talk. And if I have to meet a couple of people before I go on stage, I'll just sit behind the little keyboard and play stuff as I'm talking and I feel like the words will come out easier. It actually helps me converse better. I don't know what's wrong with me.


That's such a creative person thing to say.


	Yes. I've heard people describe me as creative. (Laughs.)


What would you say is the best piece of advice you've ever received that you would give to an aspiring artist?


	Best piece of advice I ever received was to not overthink things. Don't re-sing the vocal a bunch of times. Don't rewrite the script. Just whatever your gut is, do it. Multiple people that I've looked up to have told me that, and that's what I would continue to spread.


How do you know when you're done with a song?












	That's a good question. When there's nothing left to add to the song, or when you try to add things and it doesn't change it at all. There's a song I wrote called “That's Hilarious” in 2022, and it's a very simple production, and I was listening back to it thinking to myself, “this is too simple; it needs a guitar.” I add it. It feels out of place. “Okay, well, it doesn't need a guitar. Maybe it needs another hi-hat.” I add it. It feels weird. It feels awkward now. When I take it out, it felt much better. I guess, when you start to add things in and it feels like the cup's been filled, that's how you know when you're done with the song.


What else are you working on right now? What are you excited about in the coming months?


	I'm excited about music in general. I can't share when, but I do plan on putting music out soon. And when it does come out, I feel like a lot of question marks are going to be answered. [There will be] a lot of things that I haven't sung about. Life for me is much different than it was 10 years ago when “One Call Away” or “See You Again” came out, so there's some things to say.


	And I am constantly inspired by my surroundings, both musically and otherworldly, and I just, I hope I get to do this for the rest of my life.

While much of the Star Wars discourse has moved on from the sequel trilogy, actor John Boyega continues to make it clear that Disney's shortcomings were not his fault. Few could blame the actor for having a complicated relationship with the movies. From the very second he appeared on screen, he was subject to racist vitriol that continued throughout the release cycle. That his character, Finn, never developed a coherent arc didn't help. After the series petered out with Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker, which revealed Finn to be a space equestrian, Boyega made his issues with Disney, particularly its handling of non-white characters, very well known. Appearing at Florida Supercon 2025, per Popverse, Boyega, once again, got candid about how the sequel trilogy and how he would've made a “whole completely different thing” had he been a producer.

Boyega says that if he were wearing his producer hat on Star Wars, he wouldn't be “getting rid of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, all these people.” Instead, the “first thing we're going to do is fulfill their story, their legacy.” He envisions “a good moment of handing on the baton.” He also criticizes the new characters, saying that some of them were overpowered, echoing some of the criticisms surrounding Rey in The Force Awakens. “They won't just grab stuff and know what to do with it,” he said. “You've got to struggle like every other character in this franchise. I'd do that.”

He also would change the ending of The Last Jedi. “But Luke Skywalker wouldn't be disappearing on a rock,” he continued. “Hell no. Standing there, and he's, like, a projector? I would want to give those characters way more way more.” It's not too surprising that most of his complaints, like those of many fans, are about The Last Jedi. In a 2023 appearance on the Hot Ones spin-off, Truth Or Dab: Rapid Fire, he declared The Last Jedi the worst of his three entries. “But they're all lovely,” he clarified while shooting a side-eyed glance.

Sanchez cranked up the drama and the action, with a performance of "Die With A Smile" by Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars.

	Jessica Sanchez is the extraordinary comeback kid of America's Got Talent. And just maybe, the champion of season 20. 


	The Texas native has a life story that could've been a script written for reality TV. She auditioned for the first season of America's Got Talent back in 2006, when she herself was a child. Now, performing in the finals of AGT 2025, she's nine months pregnant with a daughter of her own.


	On Tuesday night's (Sept. 23) finale, Sanchez cranked up the drama and the action, with a performance of “Die With A Smile” by Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars. Wearing a delicate all-white ensemble, Sanchez was all power and precision, her performance triggering fireworks, confetti and a standing ovation from a full house.

	When she auditioned by singing Benson Boone's “Beautiful Things,” Sanchez blew away the judges and scored Sofía Vergara's golden buzzer, sending her immediately to the live round of the competition.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Naturally, Vergara spoke first, and enthusiastically, about Sanchez's chances of winning the $1 million prize. “It's perfection,” she remarked after the singer's final performance. “You look like a little pregnant angel. I mean you look beautiful, your voice, I've never heard anything like that. Bravo Jessica.”




	With every performance, remarked Mel B, “you kind of bring us into your world. You give us more emotion, more passion.” And no matter the song, Sanchez's “vocals are just flawless and pitch perfect, every single time.” Sanchez stuck with the script, noted the Spice Girl, by not delivering her baby before the finale.


	Howie Mandel wasn't thrilled with Sanchez's previous choice of song, but he had no qualms this time. “So far this is the best act of the night,” he declared.


	Simon Cowell, as he so often does, was last to offer his insights. “I felt there was an extra 10% from you, from before,” he explained. “Actually, there are two of you. So it's like a duo.” Having Sanchez return for the 20th anniversary of AGT was “so important,” he continued, “to show that even if you don't win the first time, you've got to always believe in yourself, right. And that's what you've done.” The arrangement was “beautiful” and Sanchez, he remarked, “sounded amazing” and delivered perhaps her best performance yet.


	Now America decides. 


	The season's final episode follows on Wednesday night, Sept. 24, featuring performances from past acts, and, of course, the announcement of the big winner. Watch from 9pm ET on NBC and streaming on Peacock.

	A process server was arrested after allegedly attempting to serve Taylor Swift deposition papers on behalf of Justin Baldoni's lawyers amid the ongoing legal feud between Baldoni and Blake Lively.


Star was first to report the news, stating that Justin Lee Fisher, 48, was caught on Sept. 15 at Kelce's gated property in Leawood, Kansas. According to the outlet, incident details were missing from the one-page police report, which allegedly stated, “This information is restricted as to use and dissemination.”


	In a Kansas Standard Offense Report filed by the Leawood Police Department on Sept. 15 and obtained by Rolling Stone, two individuals were named for the offense of “criminal trespass property” at Kelce's address. One is a male named Drew Bossi, another is a woman named Laura Baker. The redacted report excludes ages, contact information, addresses, and more. It does not include a victim and the property loss section is also blank. It is unclear what each of the individual's involvement was or was not in the process server incident, but the report took place around the same time and date at Kelce's property.

	Local station KCTV 5 reported that the address listed in the report matches the address from which Kansas City Chiefs' memorabilia had been stolen last October (when both Kelce and Patrick Mahomes' residences were burglarized during a home game). Fisher was reportedly charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing and released after posting bond; he is expected to appear in the Leawood Municipal Court on Oct. 15.

	











	The arrest appears to have occurred just days after a federal judge denied Baldoni's request to depose Swift as the It Ends With Us director prepares for a trial over Lively's sexual harassment and smear campaign claims against Baldoni.


	U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman's order arrived after Baldoni's lawyer, Ellyn S. Garofalo, alleged in a letter to the court that Swift had “agreed” to appear for deposition but was unable to do so before Oct. 20. The letter requested an extension of the Sept. 30 discovery deadline to accommodate the singer's schedule.

	Swift's lawyer refuted the claim. “As counsel for the parties know, since the inception of this matter, we have consistently maintained that my client has no material role in this action,” Swift's attorney J. Douglas Baldridge said in a letter to the judge. Baldridge made it clear that Swift “did not agree to a deposition,” but if she was “forced,” she had informed Baldoni's camp that her schedule was too busy to accommodate it before Oct. 20.


	While Baldridge didn't explain what the conflict was, Swift has been gearing up for the release of her new album, The Life of a Showgirl, set to release Oct. 3.

	In May, a rep for Swift criticized Baldoni's initial attempts to subpoena the singer. “Taylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film,” the rep previously told Rolling Stone. 


This article was updated on Sept. 24 at 12:41 p.m. to include two individuals who were named in a Kansas Standard Offense Report filed by the Leawood Police Department for the offense of “criminal trespass property” at the address connected to Kelce on Sept. 15.

Finding a babysitter can be murder, and The Hand That Rocks The Cradle is back to scare young parents out of another date night.

The cradle now rocks on streaming as this remake of the classic murderous nanny movie heads to Hulu this October. Based on Curtis Hanson's 1992 original, the remake follows young mother Caitlin Morales (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) as she welcomes a new nanny, Polly Murphy (Maika Monroe), into her family. Polly came with impeccable references that, nevertheless, neglected to mention her penchant for self-mutilation and maternal manipulation. At least we can take solace in the fact that the nanny isn't an AI.

﻿

The Hand That Rocks The Cradle hits Hulu on October 22.

Ratboys shared their last album, the Chris Walla–produced The Window, in 2023. Now, they're back with a new song and a new label home. Also co-produced with Walla, “Light Night Mountains All That” is the Chicago rock band's debut single for New West Records. Ratboys drummer Marcus Nuccio directed the accompanying music video. Watch it below.

“My original idea was to write an ultra-high energy folk song, in the style of the Dodos' Visiter, with somewhat spooky, mysterious, and pastoral lyrics—like what Chris Otepka of the Heligoats might conjure up on a mushroom trip,” Ratboys singer Julia Steiner said of the process behind the new single in a statement. “[The] guys and I nearly went insane fleshing out the arrangement and its odd timings together. I wrote the lyrics during that original demoing trip, centered around the idea of a fantastic, rural vision-quest where the days and nights blend together and nothing is quite as it seems.”

Ratboys have also announced a 2026 tour of North America, which kicks off February 25 in Detroit, Michigan and runs through mid-April. They're set to perform at Pitchfork Music Festival London this November, too. Scroll down to see all of Ratboys' upcoming shows.

ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. – St. Augustine is one of my favorite north Florida cities and has been for many years. 

My memories of St. Augustine and St. Johns County go back to my childhood. 

My parents favored the off-season for travel, and this often found us in popular spots with very few people. On one of these trips, we got a behind-the-scenes look at the Castillo de San Marcos, which led to us firing a cannon…allegedly. 

I remember when you could turn right at the Fort Matanzas Beach Drive Access and hide under the bridge before EZ-UP tents.

Thanks to my hobbies of running, cycling and riding motorcycles, I have gotten to know the county backroads intimately. 

The St. Augustine Lighthouse has been my beacon for runs and rides, and it's been a place I've wanted to explore ever since I saw that famous episode of TAPS (The Atlantic Paranormal Society), aka Ghost Hunters, around 2006 to 2008, and then again in 2019.

To be a part of a paranormal investigation at the St. Augustine Lighthouse has been a bucket list item since, and with the help of some coworkers, we got to make that happen.

Press play below to join us on a fun night of things that go bump in the night at the St. Augustine Lighthouse and Maritime Museum.

Inspired by the real-life horrors of a notorious Maryland psychiatric hospital that preyed upon Black communities for decades, Crowsville #1 kicks off a five-part comic series on November 5 from Oni Press.

Written by Rodney Barnes (“The Boondocks,” Killadelphia) and illustrated by Elia Bonetti (Death of Wolverine: The Logan Legacy), we have an exclusive look inside the first issue below.

Founded at the turn of the 20th century outside of Annapolis, Maryland, the Crownsville Hospital was a notoriously segregated, all-Black psychiatric institute. After decades of overcrowding and neglect — alongside darker, more-persistent rumors of patient abuse and illegal medical experiments — it was finally closed.

Today, it stands condemned—a crumbling testament to a legacy of all-too-real terror inflicted on a marginalized and vulnerable community. But even as a ruin of its former self, Crownsville still casts a long shadow…

When an unexplained death inside the abandoned hospital is ruled a suicide, Annapolis police detective Mike Simms and journalist Paul Blairare are compelled to dig deeper, only to discover the reality of the horrors that once took place there… and the powerful connection they share to the anguished spirits of the dead that are still locked within its walls.

The 48-page first issue of Crownsville features covers by Bonetti, Barnes' Killadelphia co-creator Jason Shawn Alexander (Spawn), Syzmon Kudranski (The Punisher), and Andrea Sorrentino (Gideon Falls).

A statement from a national organization of architects regarding the alleged misuse of the word “architect” in negative news contexts has sparked discussion among Filipinos.

The United Architects of the Philippines (UAP) released an open letter, saying it “strongly denounces the persistent misuse of the word ‘architect'” when “describing masterminds of plunder, corruption, crime, or other negative acts.” It was signed by its national president, architect Jonathan Manalad.

“Recent headlines and articles — such as referring to a government official as an ‘architect of plunder' — reflect a long-standing trend of equating the word ‘architect' with the mastermind of wrongdoings,” the organization said on Tuesday, September 23.

Recent headlines in the Philippines have focused on alleged corruption in flood control projects, with claims that government officials and lawmakers received kickbacks from these initiatives.

“This is not only misleading but gravely unjust to a profession that has, for centuries, been dedicated to the highest ideals of public service, safety, progress, and nation building,” the UAP added.

It also shared the definition of an architect as stated by the Architecture Act of 2004, which it said is “is a person professionally and academically qualified, registered, and licensed under the law, with the authority to practice architecture and responsible for the planning, design, construction, enlargement, conservation, renovation, remodeling, or alteration of buildings and the environment for human habitation.”

“Words matter,” the group said, adding that using “architect” in news reports as a synonym for ‘mastermind of crime' supposedly “corrodes public perception of the profession, trivializes years of education, licensure, and ethical responsibility, and undermines the trust that architects have worked hard to earn from the Filipino people.”

The UAP suggested that the media use words or phrases like “mastermind,” “perpetrator,” or “brains behind corruption” instead.

“The United Architects of the Philippines calls on government agencies, private institutions, and media outlets to respect and preserve the dignity of the profession by refraining from such misapplications of the term,” it said.



The statement drew mixed reactions from Filipinos, with some arguing that there are more pressing issues, such as the reported government corruption involving flood control projects.

“‘Words matter,' daw sabi ng UAP. True. Kaya when they chose to fight for a word, not against corruption, that spoke louder than anything else,” actor-content creator Chuckie Dreyfus wrote in a post.

“For the record: Merriam-Webster defines architect not just as the profession, but also as ‘a person who designs and guides a plan or undertaking,'” he added, citing a dictionary definition of the term “architect.”

“‘We architects build, we don't plunder.' Sana ‘yun na lang ang sinabi. Mas malinaw, mas makabuluhan, mas may paninindigan. Instead, lumabas tuloy na mas priority nila ang semantics kaysa sa accountability,” Chuckie continued.

“My dad was an architect. He'd laugh at this pa-woke fragility and say: corruption is the real insult, not vocabulary,” he concluded, sharing a screengrab of Merriam-Webster's definition of the word “architect.”



Some Filipinos also took to the comments to raise concerns about the UAP's perspective.

“Architect in the statement means orchestrator… Not literally the architect profession…” a Facebook user said.

“This is a little bit of an overreaction. No one in her [or] his right mind will ever interpret it the way you do. I mean, all you have to do is open a dictionary and see that ‘architect' is not just about the profession. Chill. There are bigger problems to solve and more hideous demons to slay,” another said.

“Rhetoric lang namn ‘yan, meaning, nag-isip ng isang bagay para ma-execute ang plano,” a different Pinoy commented.

“Aware ba kayo that you're actually embarrassing yourselves for this statement? May multiple meanings ang word na ‘architect,' both literal and figurative, just like author, engineer, doctor, or pilot. Not an exclusive property of one profession. An architect also means the creator [or] mastermind of a plan, project or system, good or bad,” another said.

“Doctor, a medical professional. Verb is to ‘doctor a document', that's to alter or falsify something,” the user added.

“The list goes on… Pwede naman kasi mag-check ng dictionary, no? Words evolve and carry metaphorical weight, and I don't think any society has authority to dictate or restrict how people use them outside licensing. ‘Yun lang,” the user continued.

Another lexicon, the Cambridge Dictionary, also carries two meanings for the word “architect.”

One is related to the profession, while the other is “a person responsible for achieving a particular plan or aim.”

Decades before Mark Sebastian Jordan wrote about the murderous and paranormal history of North Central Ohio, his convictions wrangled with discoveries he made every day.

“I was a skeptic,” the author said. “I very much kind of came at things from a scientific perspective.”

As a youngster, he thought he might grow up to be a paleontologist, volcanologist or some other scientist.

“I saw no provable scientific basis for ghosts, so I didn't really give it much thought,” Jordan said.

Now, 40 years of research later, he has so much evidence of hauntings throughout the region that he published them in a book called "In These Haunted Hills: Ghosts of the Ohio Highlands."

Jordan will debut the book 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sept. 27-28 during the Ohio Heritage Days at Malabar Farm State Park near Lucas.

The transition from doubter to devotee happened one day after college when Jordan clocked out for his lunch break.

“I was still living at home with my folks at this time, about halfway between Mansfield and Shelby,” he said. “That particular day, I was really tired because I was involved in a play production.”

He walked into the house and found his mother babysitting his young nephew. Exhausted, he sat down and turned on the television.

“I can hear the sound of Mom fiddling around with some pots and pans in the kitchen,” Jordan said. “Then I hear the sound of the baby toddling out of the kitchen and around the edge of the couch, and I feel a little tingle on the bottom of my chin in my beard like he's reached out his finger to touch me.”

Like a good uncle, he reached back to acknowledge the baby's playful advances.

“That's when I realized the baby's not there and the kitchen is dead quiet,” Jordan said. “Mom wasn't in there moving pots and pans around, and in fact, she had taken the baby and they went to take a nap.”

The experience forced him to reevaluate his worldview.

“That was the first point when I was confronted with the realization, ‘Oh, maybe there are things going on that I can't easily explain or dismiss,' and that was all it took,” Jordan said. “That opened the door – a crack – and ever since then, I've found that I really pick up on things like that.”

Searching for and recognizing new encounters became one of his favorite hobbies.

“It's almost like a radio thing,” Jordan said. “You have to open yourself up to tune into it, and it's very possible to tune it out.”

If the phenomena present themselves through frequencies, the region's lead investigator decided, then his own mind is the antenna. The best way to discover new programs would be to move around until he receives another clear signal.

“I've been all over the state and beyond doing ghost hunting,” Jordan said. “I think that a lot of the hauntings that are encountered by people are scientific phenomena that may yet someday be explained. They're elusive, difficult, tricky to capture.”

His work over 40 years has given him access to many locations abundant with paranormal activity and introduced him to perplexing stories from the region's history, and afforded him the time to research them to completion.

He is known throughout the Buckeye State as an author, playwright, columnist, newspaperman, music critic and folk artist.

Some of Jordan's most popular books include "The Ceely Rose Murders at Malabar Farm," "The Witch of Mansfield: The Tetched Life of Phebe Wise" and "Get Busy Living: Doing Time at Shawshank: Behind the Scenes on the World's Favorite Movie."

This summer, his publisher called and told him there would be a delay on publishing his eighth book, with his work not hitting stores until 2026.

“I understand, but I wanted to have something new for Heritage Days,” Jordan said. “I've been for the last few years trying to have out a new book every fall.”

The author's jovial smile faded as he recalled hearing the news. He took a sip of coffee with one hand, then lovingly patted his kitten, Lady Jane, with the other.

He decided in August that nothing would stop him from having a new book, so he called a second publisher and asked the absolute fastest they could edit and print his first run. The answer? Two weeks.

“I wrote the book in 13 days,” Jordan said with a glimmer in his eye. “That was 13 days of hammering.”

The new book is his ninth completed, but eighth published.

The book, "In These Haunted Hills: Ghosts of the Ohio Highlands," is a mixture of his own personal experiences, folklore from the region, eyewitness accounts he has collected and history he has researched.

“In a couple cases, I've been able to go and find the roots of stories that everyone just dismissed as folklore,” Jordan said.

The stories are from Richland, Ashland, Holmes, Coshocton, Knox and Crawford counties.

Some of the locations are famous, while others are offbeat.

“I have one chapter that is just specifically about hauntings in private residences throughout the region that I've experienced,” Jordan said.

He devoted a chapter to Brownella Cottage in Galion, a famous paranormally active house and museum.

Another section of the book is about the Ohio State Reformatory, the prison made famous by Stephen King as Shawshank State Penitentiary.

There's also a look at The Renaissance Theatre in downtown Mansfield.

“I had so much Malabar stuff that I divided that into three chapters,” Jordan said. “One is about the Big House, one is about the hostel and one is kind of miscellaneous about everything else, including the big barn.”

And some of the stories will be news to many readers, like the tale of Sarah's grave in a haunted cemetery near Greer that eventually became popular among high school students.

“Guys would take their dates and, hopefully, the dates would get scared and hug them a little closer,” Jordan said. “I dug through the detritus of time and found that there is a true story that whole situation arose from and there actually was a Sarah.”

The author hopes readers will appreciate learning more about the haunted hills of North Central Ohio.

“When I tell these stories, I do not claim to have all the answers,” Jordan said. “Anyone who tells you they do have the answers is trying to sell you something.”

If you're a fan of classic sci-fi shows like The X-Files and The Twilight Zone and are looking for a book that can scratch that itch, Little Visitor & Other Abductions may be just what the doctor ordered. This graphic novel brings together three of cartoonist Adam Szym's alien abduction tales - "A Cordial Invitation," "Little Visitor," and "Frolicker" - into one creepy package.

With Little Visitor & Other Abductions in stores now, IGN can exclusively debut a new preview of "A Cordial Invitation." Check it out in the slideshow gallery below:

Little Visitor & Other Abductions is written and drawn by Szym. The book is published by Oni Press and distributed by Simon & Schuster. Here's the official description of the book:

The cast and crew of an obscure film recount a tragedy that occurred during its doomed production. A young girl searches for her father in the darkness of the desert and stumbles upon an otherworldly cocktail party. Two strangers nurture violent thoughts in a bitter, lonely child as his village's harvest festival nears. Connecting these three stories is one horrific theme . . .

From cartoonist and illustrator Adam Szym comes a triptych of otherworldly science fiction horror stories about alien abduction and the negligence and malice that allows it to happen. Including the Ignatz Award–nominated A Cordial Invitation, Little Visitor, and a brand-new tale—Frolicker—this uncanny trilogy of graphic novellas is perfect for fans of The Twilight Zone, The X-Files, and all things beyond our understanding.

Little Visitor & Other Abductions is available in bookstores and comic shops now. You can order a copy on Amazon.

In other comic book news, DC has finally answered the burning question of whether Batman wears socks, and we've got the full scoop on what it means that Norman Osborn has become the new Spider-Man.
