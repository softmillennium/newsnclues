            Top congressional Republicans and White House allies are working behind the scenes to prevent a politically charged floor vote to release the government's Jeffrey Epstein case files next month, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions.
    


            The intensifying effort to halt that floor vote comes as Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, declared on Wednesday they have the 218 votes needed to compel one when Congress returns. That final signature on their petition to force the vote will come from Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, who won a special election in Arizona Tuesday night, once she is formally sworn in.
    


            Discharge petitions historically have a bad track record of actually forcing a vote, mostly because lawmakers in the majority are wary of taking a stand against leadership. The Epstein issue, however, has animated some Republican members, with Trump allies on Capitol Hill like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina signing onto the petition.
    


            While the exact strategy to avoid a vote is not yet clear, some of the GOP lawmakers who have signed on are privately being pressured to withdraw their name from the petition, which would prevent a vote from taking place, one of those sources said.
    


            Boebert told CNN last week that she would not be removing her name from the petition, noting at the time that she was not getting pressured to do so.
    


            GOP leaders are now working to prevent the vote from happening, one of the sources said, because Massie and Khanna are just days away from collecting the 218 signatures needed to force leadership's hand. The pair had notched their 217th signature earlier this month when Democratic Rep. James Walkinshaw, fresh off winning a special election in Virginia's 11th District, was sworn in and signed the petition.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson has argued that Massie's petition has been drafted in a way that does not adequately protect victims' personal information and has said the full House has no need to take a vote while the Oversight Committee's investigation is ongoing.
    


            The last time Johnson was confronted with a discharge petition, he reached a compromise with Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, the GOP lawmaker pushing the bill, and she agreed not to force the vote. Johnson had previously tried to kill Luna's petition by inserting language – through the House Rules Committee – into an unrelated rule vote. That effort, however, failed on the floor.
    


            Republicans on the House Rules Committee have made clear that this time, they will not help Johnson kill the Epstein files vote, a third source said.
    


            While few Republicans have backed the effort to force a vote, a number have expressed support for the underlying bill. Still, it would face an uphill battle in the Senate if it cleared the House.

Former president says successor's claims about drug branded Tylenol in US ‘undermines public health that can do harm to women'

Barack Obama has said Donald Trump's claims linking paracetamol to autism in infants is “violence against the truth” that could harm pregnant women if they were too scared to take pain relief.

Obama, who was being interviewed by David Olusoga at the O2 Arena, told the audience that Trump's claims about paracetamol – branded as Tylenol in the US – had been “continuously disproved” and posed a danger to public health.

“We have the spectacle of my successor in the Oval Office making broad claims around certain drugs and autism that have been continuously disproved,” he said. “It undermines public health … that can do harm to women.”

On Monday Trump had said: “Taking Tylenol is not good … All pregnant women should talk to their doctors about limiting the use of this medication while pregnant.”

The comments were criticised by the UK health secretary, Wes Streeting, who encouraged women to ignore the president's comments.

Obama argued there was a “tug of war” between two visions for the future of the US and humanity. On one side the progressive view where change came through democracy, the other driven by populists including Trump wanting a return to an older, more conservative worldview.

He said: “My successor has not been particularly shy about it. That desire is to go back to a very particular way of thinking about America, where ‘we, the people', is just some people, not all people. And where there are some pretty clear hierarchies in terms of status and who ranks where.”

Obama was also critical of progressives who he said became “complacent” and “smug” in the 90s and 00s, “posturing that we believe in all these values because they were never tested. Now they're being tested”.

The former president has generally kept a low profile after leaving office. But he has made increasingly frequent interventions as the political landscape in the US becomes more violent, restive and divided along partisan lines.

In London, Obama did not refer to Trump by name, only as “my successor”.

The evening started with Olusoga welcoming the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, who had been criticised by Trump on Tuesday during his speech at the UN in New York. Khan had responded by saying Trump had “shown he is racist, he is sexist, he is misogynistic and he's Islamophobic”.

Obama is in London as part of a European speaking tour, which includes another date in Dublin on Friday. He is due to receive the Freedom of Dublin on Thursday.

            The first new episode of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” since his suspension averaged 6.3 million viewers via traditional television, more than three times the show's typical TV viewership, even though the show was blacked out in dozens of markets.
    


            In the key advertiser-friendly demographic of viewers ages 18 to 49, the show scored its “highest regularly scheduled episode in over 10 years,” ABC said Wednesday afternoon.
    


            And on YouTube, Kimmel has been gaining more than a million views per hour. Combining ABC, YouTube and social media platforms, Kimmel's monologue about free speech in America has reached tens of millions of people, and the view counts are still rising.
    


            The preliminary Nielsen ratings, which will grow later once on-demand viewership is calculated, are all the more notable because the Kimmel telecast was not shown on scores of local ABC-affiliated stations.
    


Missed Kimmel's return? Here's a transcript of his monologue



            Two major TV station groups, Nexstar and Sinclair, are continuing to preempt the talk show, and those groups have ABC-affiliated stations that reach roughly 23%  of American TV households.
    


            Curious viewers in those markets likely turned to YouTube and other streaming platforms to see Kimmel's nearly 30-minute-long monologue.
    


            The monologue video has been viewed more than 15 million times on YouTube so far, making it Kimmel's most-viewed monologue of all time on the platform.
    


            Previously, Kimmel's most-watched YouTube video was the monologue when he tearfully revealed his son Billy's heart disease eight years ago.

Democrats say Trump allies are using incident for ‘political points' against the left despite the victims being detainees

A deadly shooting at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) field office in Dallas has been met with markedly different reactions from the political right and left.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed shortly after the news broke that detainees were the victims of the sniper attack on the facility and that no federal agents had been injured. The president and his allies, however, were quick to frame the shooting as an attack on Ice and place blame on the “radical left”.

The department previously said two detainees were killed, but later issued a clarifying statement saying the shooting killed one detainee. It said two other detainees were shot and are in critical condition.

Official statements have lacked focus on the victims having been detainees, and at a press conference officials said the identities of the victims would not be released at this time. Figures on the left have centered on the victims' families, pushed for greater gun control and urged a rejection of anti-immigrant sentiment.

Donald Trump rushed to politicize the incident, blaming the violence squarely on “Radical Left Terrorists” and the Democratic party. “This violence is the result of the Radical Left Democrats constantly demonizing Law Enforcement, calling for ICE to be demolished, and comparing ICE Officers to “Nazis,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform.

JD Vance called the shooting an “obsessive attack on law enforcement” that “must stop”. The vice-president claimed it was carried out by “a violent left-wing extremist” who was “politically motivated to go after law enforcement”.

Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem also said: “This shooting must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about Ice has consequences. Comparing Ice Day-in and day-out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences.”

The FBI said authorities recovered shell casings with “anti-Ice messaging” near the shooter, but officials said the investigation was continuing and have neither confirmed the motive behind the attack, nor corroborated claims about the shooter's ideological background.

The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence. The DHS said the shooter “fired indiscriminately” at the Ice facility, “including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot”. The attacker died from a self-inflicted gun wound.

Greg Abbott, the Republican Texas governor and staunch Trump ally, called the attack an “assassination” and said that “Texas supports Ice”. He wrote on X: “This assassination will NOT slow our arrest, detention, & deportation of illegal immigrants. We will work with ICE & the Dallas Police Dept. to get to the bottom of the assassin's motive.”

Texas senator Ted Cruz also invoked the killing of rightwing commentator Charlie Kirk as he told reporters that political violence “must stop” and rebuked politicians who have been critical of Ice. “Your political opponents are not Nazis,” Cruz raged at Democrats, who he accused of “demonizing” Ice. “This has very real consequences,” he said.

Later, after a reporter brought up reports that the victims were detainees, Cruz acknowledged that the motive of the shooter was not known.

The attack comes amid fears the Trump administration plans a crackdown on leftwing organizations and amid the censorship of critical or nuanced commentary in the aftermath of Kirk's killing, targeting people from visa holders to late-night talkshow host Jimmy Kimmel.

Marc Veasey, a Democratic representative for Texas who represents the area where the shooting took place, told the Notus website that political “gamesmanship” was spiraling out of control, and said he was “sickened” by officials' focus on law enforcement and lack of acknowledgement that the victims were detainees.

He added that he lacked trust in the FBI, which had become “overly political” under Trump, and said smears against Democrats were not helpful, citing that the GOP also routinely call colleagues on the left “Marxists”.

“We have to start condemning this rhetoric from both sides,” Veasey said. “I was hoping that after the assassination of Charlie Kirk that we would have learned lessons and that we realize that this is not about gamesmanship. This is not about one-upsmanship … This is about public safety.”

Former Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who leads the gun violence prevention group Giffords, said her heart broke for the victims' families and urged leaders to take action against the “gun crime crisis” gripping the country.

Congresswoman Summer Lee of Pennsylvania, wrote on X: “Leave it to this administration to use a shooting against immigrant detainees to score political points and further provoke violence. We have to get guns off our streets and reject xenophobic and anti-immigrant sentiment that makes all of us less safe.”

Pennsylvania state representative Malcolm Kenyatta said: “Kristi Noem couldn't get to Twitter fast enough to use the Dallas Ice shooting for political points. But local news now says it was detainees who were shot – not Ice agents.”

A push to repeal the Roadless Rule that protects the few ecosystems that remain truly wild faces mass public opposition.

A Trump administration proposal to rescind a bedrock conservation rule that protects 45 million acres of pristine national forests and the nation's least-developed public lands from logging, road construction, development, and pollution is facing widespread opposition. Despite federal regulators providing an unusually brief time window for public comment, hundreds of thousands of comments were filed, with one analysis showing a near-unanimous desire to keep the rule in place.

The Roadless Area Conservation Rule, also known as the Roadless Rule, prohibits road construction and timber harvests in many of the remaining wilderness areas that standard cars and trucks cannot reach, effectively preventing mining, hydrocarbon extraction, and logging in those areas and limiting the human footprint in pristine ecosystems. Conservation groups say the rule is critical for preserving sources of clean drinking water, wildlife migration corridors, and access to large areas of unfragmented backcountry cherished by outdoors enthusiasts.

“Roadless Areas are not just scenic backcountry — they are biodiversity strongholds and fire-adapted ecosystems that rely on natural, mixed-severity fire to thrive,” said Jennifer Mamola, advocacy and policy director at the John Muir Project, a forest science think tank, in an email.

The potential repeal of the Roadless Rule would add to a long list of environmental protections slashed under President Donald Trump. In March,​​ Trump ordered the Forest Service and other agencies to bypass the Endangered Species Act and promote an “immediate expansion” of timber production on federal lands as part of a broader push to empower favored industries. The Trump administration argues the Roadless Rule is a needless regulation that frustrates local land managers, stifles “jobs and economic growth” in rural communities, and limits access for wildfire prevention efforts such as fuel management — which Trump has called “cleaning the floors” — a claim Mamola said contradicts studies linking roadbuilding to an increase in human-caused fires.

“Weakening protections puts both wildlife and the integrity of these landscapes at risk, while doing nothing to make our communities safer,” Mamola said.

Big timber and paper companies that would profit from greater access to old-growth forests in Alaska and the Western U.S. tend to support more Republican than Democratic candidates and spend millions of dollars a year lobbying Congress, according to OpenSecrets. Trump was the industry's top recipient of campaign cash in 2024, followed by Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Arkansas).

The rule was enacted in 2001 after the Forest Service collaborated with multiple federal agencies to hold hundreds of public hearings as well as consultations with Native American tribes across the Western United States over a two-year period. At the time, 1.6 million public comments poured in, with more than 90 percent supporting the protections for wilderness, according to the Center for Western Priorities.

This history of public input stands in stark contrast to the process today under Trump to repeal the rule. On August 27, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins announced a 21-day window for the public to comment on the administration's proposal for rescinding the Roadless Rule. Public comment periods are typically at least 30 days and can run up to 90 or 120 days for complex federal regulations with broad impact.

Despite the truncated public comment period, the proposal to rescind the rule received 625,737comments by September 19, which includes some 400,000 petitions opposing the proposal that were delivered in bulk by conservation groups in the final hours of the comment period. An analysis of 183,000 comments filed before the bulk petitions arrived from the Center for Western Priorities found that more than 99 percent opposed the rescission of the rule. Less than 1 percent of comments supported rescinding the rule, including a comment from the Republican Party of New Mexico, which argues the rule frustrates local land managers.

Rep. Jared Huffman is the ranking member on the House Natural Resources Committee and a Democrat from a densely forested district in northern California, where the Six Rivers National Forest alone supplies $428 million worth of clean drinking water to homes each year. In a letter to Rollins on September 19, Huffman said the Roadless Rule also protects clean water sources and recreational access to the Mendocino National Forest and the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in his district, and urged the secretary to extend the public comment period by 45 days and by 120 days for tribal consultation.

“Repealing the Rule would be a profound mistake, locking in a future of increasingly severe wildfires, fiscal irresponsibility, and water scarcity. I urge you to abandon this reckless course and uphold the Roadless Rule's protections,” Huffman said in a statement.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's press office did not respond to Truthout's requests for comment by the time this story was published.

Supporters of rescinding the Roadless Rule argue it creates barriers to active forest management and efforts to prevent wildfires that are intensifying with climate change, such as clearing potential fuel for fire. However, like Mamola, Huffman says this is misleading. The Roadless Rule does allow for fuel management and timber harvests under certain circumstances, according to Huffman, and dozens of conservation groups agree that punching more holes into the backcountry with roads would lead to more human-caused fires, as research has shown.

“Peer-reviewed science shows that logging in backcountry landscapes does not protect communities and often increases fire risk, especially near roads, where 95 percent of human-caused fires occur,” Mamola said. “By contrast, investments in home hardening and defensible space deliver a three to four times return in disaster recovery, according to FEMA's 2018 report.”

Last month, 155 public lands groups, including the John Muir Project, sent a letter to Congress calling for stronger protections for designated roadless areas, specifically highlighting loopholes that allow logging and road-building under the guise of wildfire mitigation.

“Now, as the push to repeal the Roadless Rule gains momentum, closing these loopholes and protecting these wildlands is more urgent than ever,” Mamola said. 

Instead of rescinding the Roadless Rule, the groups urge Congress to protect the entire 58.2 million-acre roadless area as initially surveyed and regulated under the Clinton administration, and to add new protections such as prohibitions on commercial cattle grazing and motorized vehicles. The Trump administration says its proposal to rescind the rule would impact 45 million acres of the nearly 60 million currently without roads.

Conservationists say roadless areas are also buffer zones that protect national parks and wildlife sanctuaries visited by hikers and tourists from expanding wildfires. There's one reason why many backcountry areas remain roadless: they are difficult to reach, and the Forest Service already faces a $4.85 billion backlog of road maintenance across the existing 370,000 miles of forest roads, according to Huffman. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is making sweeping staffing and budget cuts and shuttering nine regional Forest Service offices nationwide.

Despite the widespread backlash amongst the public, one of the Trump administration's most needed allies in Congress has long pushed to axe the rule. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski has long supported a repeal of the Roadless Rule to further development of wild areas in her home state of Alaska. Murkowski reiterated that support of rescinding the Roadless Rule shortly after Rollins announced the proposal in June. 

According to Wes Siler, an outdoor recreation journalist writing on Substack, the Roadless Rule presents a major barrier to opening the remote Tongass National Forest in Alaska to both domestic and international logging companies. The Tongass is a vast temperate rainforest with ecosystems unlike any found elsewhere in the world. Still, Siler expects the national forest could be saved by a combination of sheer incompetence and Trump's sweeping cuts to federal agencies. Siler reports that Rollins has a paltry $50 million budget to build new Forest Service roads.

“Building roads into the Tongass was estimated to cost on average $500,000-a-mile back in 2020, when the first Trump administration tried these shenanigans for the first time,” Siler wrote on August 29. “Updated for Trumpflation, that's now $620,699. In a best case scenario, that budget only buys 80 miles of new road.”

Whether the administration will agree to extend another comment period on the Roadless Rule and commit to closer consultation with local communities and tribal governments remains to be seen. Federal law requires an environmental impact analysis of the proposal that is expected to be finalized next year and face a litany of legal challenges that could further delay any changes to the rule.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing a rollback of certain Biden-era regulations that determine how the agency evaluates chemicals — a move it says will speed innovation. Critics argue the plan weakens safeguards to protect people from toxic exposures.

The EPA on Monday released proposed changes to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) that would remove amendments made in 2024 under the Biden administration. TSCA is a federal law under which the EPA evaluates chemicals to make sure human and environmental health will be protected before chemicals are put into the marketplace. The proposed changes include removing the 2024 amendment that required the agency to consider every use and exposure route of a chemical when evaluating risk. 

In its explanation, the EPA wrote that the 2024 amendment could “negatively impact EPA's ability to complete risk evaluations in a timely manner” and added that the agency should have discretion in deciding which “conditions of use, exposure routes and exposure pathways it will consider in risk evaluation,” a move that would allow the EPA to exclude some uses of a chemical from its reviews.

This proposed change ignores that people are often exposed to the same chemical from different sources, said Maria Doa, senior director of chemicals policy for the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund. “If you live in a community and there's a facility nearby releasing a chemical into the air … and you are exposed to the same chemical from a product that you use at home, your body doesn't treat these exposures differently,” she said.

“What happens is they would regulate the one use and not the other. But if you look at the combination, they both contribute to your exposure,” Doa added.

Other proposed changes include scaling back how much information manufacturers need to provide for a proposed chemical; considering personal protection and safety equipment use when evaluating workplace chemical risks; and allowing the agency to determine if certain uses of a chemical carry unreasonable risks instead of making a single risk judgment based on all of the chemical's uses — the latter approach negatively impacts technological innovation and businesses, according to the proposed rule change.

Doa said these changes are “all coordinated in order to lower what they characterize as exposures and risk.” 

EPA administrator Lee Zeldin touted the changes as “a clear, predictable, commonsense approach that's grounded in the law and the science” in an accompanying statement. 

“This work is yet another example of how we can and will protect human health and the environment while allowing manufacturing and industrial sectors to thrive,” he said.

The EPA has made multiple environmental rollbacks in the first few months of the Trump administration that appease the industries the agency regulates. The proposed TSCA changes are in line with suggestions from the National Association of Manufacturers' “wishlist” sent to the Trump administration last December. 

Last week, The New Lede reported that top EPA officials are frequently meeting with lobbyists from the chemical, plastic, agricultural and energy industries and mostly shutting out health and environmental groups. 

The findings were based on the calendars of Nancy Beck, the EPA's principal deputy assistant administrator in the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, and Lynn Ann Dekleva, the deputy assistant administrator of the same EPA office. Both previously worked at the American Chemistry Council — which represents chemical manufacturers and praised the proposed changes in a statement. 

“By revisiting provisions that created unnecessary complexity, confusion and uncertainty, EPA is taking steps to ensure that TSCA risk evaluations incorporate the best available and most recent science by adequately considering relevant exposures and condition of use information to inform decision-making,” said Kimberly Wise White, the council's vice president of regulatory and scientific affairs. 

The EPA is accepting public comment on the proposed changes for the next month.

            Six months ago, 4-year-old Jose Morales-Ortiz was struggling to say two-word sentences. Jose has severe autism, and he couldn't have a conversation and wouldn't answer to his name most of the time — all things that kids his age are supposed to be able to do.
    


            By the end of June, though, it was clear something had changed.
    


            Keith Joyce, his guardian, said Jose was able to tell him about the other kids at school and answer follow-up questions.
    


            “The first time I realized I'd had a conversation with him, I cried,” said Joyce, 60, of St. Paul, Minnesota, who has been raising Jose since he was a baby and calls him “my guy.”
    


            Joyce credits these milestones to leucovorin, a drug currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to ease the side effects of certain kinds of chemotherapy.
    


            On Monday, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said the agency would speed a label change for leucovorin to help kids with folate deficiency in their brains — something he said could cause developmental delays and features of autism, including difficulties with communication, sensory processing and repetitive behaviors. With the label change, state Medicaid programs will be able to cover it, and the administration has pledged to conduct more research on it as a therapy.
    


            “This gives hope to the many parents with autistic children that it may be possible to improve their lives,” President Donald Trump said at Monday's news conference. “That's one of the things that I'm very, very happy about.”
    


            At the same briefing, Trump also made unsupported claims about the painkiller Tylenol as a cause of autism and cautioned parents about getting too many vaccines for their kids.
    


            Trump's comments sparked widespread concern and criticism from many in the autism community. But there's some curiosity about a new use for the old drug, too.
    


            “A much higher standard of science would be needed to determine if leucovorin is an effective and safe treatment for autism,” the Autism Science Foundation said of the FDA's announcement. The group said it doesn't currently recommend the drug as a treatment for autism based on existing evidence, but “we welcome additional investigation into leucovorin.”
    


            The theory behind leucovorin is that it treats a condition called cerebral folate deficiency, or low folate levels in the brain. Folate is a B vitamin that's critical for neural development.
    


            Pregnant women take the synthetic form, folic acid, in prenatal vitamins. Folic acid is also used to fortify flour and grain products, to help prevent neural tube defects like spina bifida in the womb.
    


            In 2005, a pediatric neurologist in Germany discovered that some children with symptoms of autism had normal folate levels in their blood but low folate levels in their brains. These children also made antibodies – specialized Y-shaped proteins – that blocked the receptors, or gateways, that carry folate into the brain.
    


            In a subsequent study, 25 of 28 children with cerebral folate deficiency made these antibodies, while none of 28 typically developing children had them.  The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
    


            The German doctor worked with a cell biologist at SUNY-Downstate named Edward Quadros who had developed a blood test called FRAT, for Folate Receptor Autoantibody Test. That test has since been licensed to a private lab, and doctors can order it for about $300.
    


            Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist in private practice in Phoenix, Arizona, was intrigued by the research and began testing kids who came through his clinic.
    


            “We showed that about 75% of the kids with autism have this folate receptor alpha that blocks the ability of folate to get into the nervous system,” Frye said.  “And we treated them with leucovorin and showed that their language improved, their verbal communication improved.”
    


            In a clinical trial published in 2013, Frye found that one-third of treated children saw moderate to much improvement compared with a control group of children who were on a waiting list for this therapy, “mostly in communication, verbal communication, expressive speech, receptive language and such,” he said.
    


            Frye was able to repeat those findings in another study published a few years later. His results have been confirmed in small clinical trials in France, India, Singapore, China and Iran.
    


            Frye is still cautious, though. 



            “There's no autism pill,” he said. “And there's no one-size-fits-all. The one thing we know about autism is that it's very complicated, and kids need to be taken individually.”
    


            Joyce, Jose's guardian, first read about leucovorin in December, but there wasn't much to go on — just a handful of small studies.
    


            He said he's constantly on the lookout for new science or medicine that can help Jose, who is in school and specialized therapy for 65 hours a week, but he was wary. It took three months before he even asked Jose's doctor about the drug.
    


            “I completely believe in the whole scientific method,” Joyce said, and there simply wasn't enough science to support its use for children with autism.
    


            But it's also a very safe medicine. It's a high dose form of vitamin B9, so the body flushes out what it doesn't use.
    


            Joyce eventually thought it might be worth a trial but couldn't get an off-label prescription for Jose until a specialized developmental pediatrician who Jose sees, who had just been to a conference where it was discussed, agreed it had promise.
    


            Because the medication is pretty safe, they decided to forgo the antibody test – which wasn't covered by their insurance – and just give the drug a try.
    


            Jose had a baseline speech assessment in April so they would be able to measure whether the medication was helping. Within a couple months, though, the changes were so noticeable, nobody felt like the follow-up test was necessary.
    


            “We went in for a follow-up four months later, and the changes were so dramatic,” Joyce said. The doctor was blown away. “She was just like, ‘Wow!'”
    


            There have been no large placebo-controlled trials of leucovorin for autism, as would typically be required by the FDA before it approves a drug. In some cases, the effects – which were measured over a few weeks or months – seem modest, said Dr. David Mandell, who directs the Penn Center for Mental Health at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.
    


            Mandell says the most rigorous study, from China, “finds a one-point change, on average, in on a 60-point scale in favor of leucovorin. So like a tiny, really not clinically significant change.”
    


            Still, Mandell agrees that the medication is pretty safe. The most common side effects in kids are stomach issues like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and loss of appetite. Children with autism may already be prone to these kinds of issues, so he says that needs to be watched.
    


            More seriously, he said, kids with autism who also take certain medications for seizures may see an increase in those seizures if they take leucovorin. The use of this medication needs to be monitored by a doctor.
    


            Frye also said leucovorin can also intensify hyperactivity and behavioral issues.
    


            That happened to a degree with Jose, Joyce said. “He's definitely more hyper and more active than he was, but it's within tolerable limits.”
    


            For a while, it also made daily life overwhelming.
    


            At soccer practice, for example, Jose would go out onto the field but come off five minutes later and not be able to re-engage.
    


            “Our theory is that his world grew so big, so fast, he was having a problem digesting it,” Joyce said, adding that it doesn't happen so much anymore.
    


            In a news release Monday, the FDA said it had conducted its own review of scientific evidence for leucovorin and concluded it was enough to change the label of the drug to indicate that it could help children with low levels of folate in their brains.
    


            “Children are suffering and deserve access to potential treatments that have shown promise. We are using gold standard science and common sense to deliver for the American people,” Makary said in a statement.
    


            The agency has not made its scientific review available to the public, however.
    


            “The FDA will release its review of the data and will publish a manuscript in the near future,” said Andrew Nixon, director of communications for the US Department of Health and Human Services, in a statement to CNN.
    


            He said the FDA also intends to issue updated prescribing information for the drug that will include “the essential scientific information needed for the safe and effective use of these drug products for the treatment of cerebral folate deficiency in adults and pediatric patients.”
    


            From his own review, Mandell at the University of Pennsylvania said that the evidence behind leucovorin for autism doesn't rise to the level of “gold-standard science” and that the approval for autism is dangerous on a couple of levels: First, because it sets a dangerous precedent for drug approvals, and second, because it could be giving false hope to desperate families.
    


            If the FDA grants a new indication for leucovorin, as it has said that it intends to do, it would be the first time that's happened for a drug with such a small amount of evidence behind it, said a former FDA official who declined to be named because they feared retaliation from the Trump administration.
    


            “The hypocrisy of what's going on here, of saying that you want to use gold-standard science and then using the lowest standard of junk science, I mean, this is a really low standard to make a major sweeping change. It should not be lost on people,” the official said.
    


            The announcement of the drug approval in a high-profile White House news conference may also push people to experiment on their own, without guidance from a doctor or the FDA.
    


            In May, Joyce started a Facebook group called “Leucovorin for Autism” to share his research into leucovorin and answer questions in case other parents wanted their children to try it. Since the White House announcement, it has gained more than 10,000 members.
    


            He has noticed a worrying trend: people rushing to buy over-the-counter folinic acid supplements, which are different from the prescription version and contain only micrograms of its active ingredient.
    


            In clinical trials, children were dosed leucovorin based on their weight but could take up to 50 milligrams per day.
    


            Some of the supplements “have as little as 800 micrograms (0.8 milligrams) of folinic acid, leading to having to take a lot to get a therapeutic dose,” Joyce said.
    


            The supplements may also have additives or extra ingredients that kids are getting in big doses, which could cause problems, he added.
    


            The group has a rule, Joyce said: no talking about the causes of autism. He said he spent part of the day on Tuesday deleting posts and mean comments about the painkiller Tylenol.
    


            “I'm trying to ignore the source and thankful for the attention,” he said.
    


            He's also hopeful for Jose, who has had improvements in communication and in learning since starting the drug.
    


            Before, when Joyce would take Jose to a Minnesota Loons soccer game, the child would hyperfocus on the field, rarely looking up to notice the crowd around him.
    


            But this summer, Jose began to pay attention to the fans' chants during the game and watched when people waved their scarves.
    


            “I was just like, ‘Wow, he knows the world's here,' ” Joyce said.

One detainee was killed and two were critically wounded in shooting the White House says is ‘politically motivated'

Texas Ice facility shooting – latest updates

Texas Ice facility shooting: Republicans blame ‘radical left' as Democrats focus on victims and gun control

A gunman fired at a Dallas immigration field office on Wednesday, killing one detainee and critically wounding two more, before killing himself in what authorities called an indiscriminate attack on US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).

Here's what we know about the attack so far:

One detainee has been killed, with two others in critical condition. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said previously that two detainees had been killed and one injured, but issued a corrected statement. The Dallas police chief, Daniel Comeaux, said that the FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence. The shooter died from a “self-inflicted gun wound”, according to the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem.

The DHS said no members of law enforcement were hurt in the attack. But Comeaux also said that officials would not be releasing the identities of any victims at this time.

DHS officials say this was “an attack on Ice law enforcement”. At both today's press conference and in a statement, law enforcement said that shell casings found near the shooter had “anti-Ice” messaging on them.

The shooter has been identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, according to NBC News – which cited several senior law enforcement officials.

Dallas police said that shots were fired “from an adjacent building”. The DHS later added that the shooter “fired indiscriminately” at the Ice facility, “including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot”. All three victims were inside the van at the time the gunman opened fire.

The Dallas field office where the shooting occurred is used for short-term processing of people in custody. The victims may have been recently arrested by Ice. The facility is along Interstate 35 East, south-west of a large commercial airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and just blocks from hotels catering to airport travelers.

Despite the fact that no federal agents were wounded in the shooting, the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, called the attack an “assassination”. For her part, Noem said that “these horrendous killings must serve as a wake-up call to the far left that their rhetoric about Ice has consequences”.

Donald Trump instantly politicized the shooting, claiming in a social media post that it “is the result of the Radical Left Democrats constantly demonizing Law Enforcement, calling for ICE to be demolished, and comparing ICE Officers to ‘Nazis.'”

The vice-president, JD Vance, claimed without evidence that the shooting was carried out by “a violent leftwing extremist” who was “politically motivated to go after law enforcement”. While the FBI has said that authorities recovered shell casings with “anti-Ice messaging” near the shooter, officials have neither confirmed a motive nor corroborated Vance's claims about the shooter's ideological background.

The special election race to fill a vacancy in Arizona's 7th Congressional District has been won by Democratic candidate Adelita Grijalva, a former Pima County supervisor and member of the Tucson school board, narrowing the already-slim Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. 

Grijalva's win on Tuesday also means that there will likely be enough support in the House to force a bipartisan vote on releasing federal investigative files relating to disgraced financier and accused child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.

Grijalva will serve out the remainder of the term that the late Rep. Raúl Grijalva, her father, was set to complete before he passed away in March. In winning her race, Grijalva becomes the first-ever Latina congresswoman to represent Arizona in Washington.

Grijalva handily defeated her Republican opponent, Daniel Butierez. With 87 percent of the votes counted, Grijalva had a commanding lead of 68.5 percent, while Butierez attained only 29.8 percent of the vote. 

In her victory speech, Grijalva referenced her father's commitment to serving his community, both at home and in the nation's capital.

“More than 50 years ago, my dad started a movement based on dignity and equity for all. Fifty years later, that movement is alive,” Grijalva told her supporters.

She then vowed to push for a vote on releasing the Epstein files on her first day in office.

“We reject the MAGA agenda and we will hold this administration accountable,” Grijalva said.

Grijalva's win on Tuesday narrows the Republican House majority, with the GOP now holding 219 seats to Democrats' 214 seats. (Two spots remain vacant.) That means Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson can only afford two dissenting votes from his own party to pass bills, at least for the time being.

Grijalva's win also makes her the 218th lawmaker in the House to support a bipartisan call for the release of the Epstein files, as a few Republicans agree with the Democratic conference on doing so. With that number reached, lawmakers in the chamber can now file a discharge petition, allowing them to put a bill up for a vote without prior approval from the speaker. If that bill passes, it would then head to the Senate for debate and a vote.

The House vote would be a political embarrassment for Johnson, who has been a staunch defender of President Donald Trump, especially when it comes to the Epstein files. Trump, who was once friends with Epstein, has characterized demands for the files' release as a “hoax” against him, and Johnson has defended the president at every juncture where the Epstein files are brought up.

Johnson, for example, at one point defended Trump by claiming that the president was an FBI informant in the Epstein case. The speaker then walked those comments back, instead saying that Trump was cooperative with the FBI on the matter, as implying that he was an “informant” gave the impression that Trump knew about Epstein's misdeeds. 

There is huge distrust among the American public when it comes to the Epstein files. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll published in July, 69 percent of respondents said they believed the federal government was withholding important facts about Epstein and his associates. Only 6 percent said they didn't believe such facts were being kept secret, while another 25 percent said they were unsure.

            Federal prosecutors are nearing a decision whether to bring possible perjury charges against former FBI Director James Comey, with a legal deadline expiring on Tuesday, according to people familiar with the investigation.
    


            The probe, run by federal prosecutors at the US Attorney's Office for Virginia's eastern district, is examining whether Comey made false statements during his September, 30, 2020, testimony to Congress on his handling of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, people familiar with the matter said. Prosecutors, under criminal law, generally would only have five years to the day to bring a charge.
    


            If a federal grand jury were to approve the case by next week, it would mark one of the highest-profile indictments of a political figure during President Donald Trump's second term in office – and against one of the longtime figures whom Trump and his political allies detest the most from what they call the “deep state” of the federal government.
    


            Comey hasn't been charged with a crime and has maintained in testimony that he's been truthful under oath. An attorney representing Comey in the matter hasn't responded to requests for comment from CNN.

A spokesperson for the Utah sheriff's office says suspected Charlie Kirk assassin Tyler Robinson is still being housed in a Utah County Jail special unit for the time being and has been mentally evaluated.

Robinson, 22, is accused of shooting and killing Kirk at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, on Sept. 10. He was arrested 33 hours after the incident.

A former RBC employee allegedly accessed Prime Minister Mark Carney's banking profile in June.Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press

A former Royal Bank of Canada RY-T employee is facing criminal charges after allegedly accessing Prime Minister Mark Carney's banking profile and participating in a fraud scheme believed to be linked to organized crime.

Ibrahim El-Hakim, who was then a client adviser, allegedly accessed Mr. Carney's profile on June 17 at an RBC branch near Parliament Hill.

The 23-year-old Ottawa resident has been charged with fraud over $5,000, unauthorized use of a computer, identity theft and trafficking in identity information, according to court documents.

The allegations have not been proven in court.

Cheryl Brean, a spokesperson for RBC, said the bank worked closely with law enforcement to support their investigation.

“While we cannot comment on specifics of matters before the court, we can share that we independently identified unauthorized system access, took immediate action to engage authorities and the individual named is no longer employed at the bank,” Ms. Brean said in a statement.

According to an affidavit from an RCMP officer, RBC's director of security interviewed Mr. El-Hakim on June 27 as part of the bank's internal investigation.

During the interview, Mr. El-Hakim, who was hired in 2022, admitted to participating in fraud, according to the court document. He said he had been lured into the scheme by someone on the Telegram app using the alias “AI WORLD,” which is believed to be a group linked to organized crime, the affidavit said.

The Telegram user asked him to create banking profiles, obtain credit cards and access customer profiles, paying him $500 for each completed request, according to the affidavit. Mr. El-Hakim received a total of $5,000 in payment to his accounts at Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the document said.

According to RBC's internal investigation, the total credit-card fraud amounts to $68,500. The majority of the alleged fraud occurred in June and was captured on camera, although some occurred earlier, according to the affidavit.

Mr. El-Hakim also allegedly accessed a banking profile belonging to a Justin Trudeau, according to the affidavit, although the CBC reported that the RCMP later confirmed the account did not belong to the former prime minister.

The RCMP officer's affidavit was filed in Montreal as part of a request to preserve security footage held by Tyco Integrated Security.

Mr. El-Hakim could not be reached for comment. His lawyer, Ronald Guertin, declined to comment, noting that he has not yet received all of the police information regarding the allegations.

A spokesperson for the Prime Minister's Office also declined to comment, noting that the matter is in the hands of the RCMP.

According to the affidavit, the RCMP's Eastern Region Integrated National Security Enforcement Team began investigating the matter in early July.

Integrated National Security Enforcement Teams, or INSETs, are multiagency teams led by the RCMP that work to combat the activities of terrorist groups and individuals who threaten Canada's national security.

Key developments on Sept. 24:

Russia launched an attack on a Ukrainian Ground Forces training ground on Sept. 24, including two Iskander ballistic missiles, causing casualties among personnel, the military reported.

Despite security precautions, a direct hit against a shelter made it impossible to fully prevent casualties, according to the military."The relevant emergency services are working at the scene. The injured personnel are receiving all necessary medical assistance," the statement said.

The Ukrainian Ground Forces did not disclose the location of the strike.

The military added that efforts are ongoing to fortify training centers, ranges, and other military infrastructure with reinforced shelters to reduce casualties from continued Russian attacks.

Russian forces have repeatedly targeted Ukrainian training grounds, including sites far from the front lines. These strikes have raised concerns over the safety of personnel and the preparedness of protective measures at rear-area facilities.

Ukraine carried out strikes on multiple targets in Russia linked to oil refining and drone production, Ukraine's General Staff confirmed on Sept. 24.

The General Staff said the strike hit the Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat petrochemical plant in the Republic of Bashkortostan, specifically the ELOU-AVT-6 primary oil refining unit. Preliminary reports indicate the attack caused a fire at the site.

The targeted facility processes up to 10 million tons of oil annually and is a key producer of liquid rocket fuel for Russia, according to the General Staff.

In addition to the strike on the oil refinery in the Republic of Bashkortostan, Ukrainian forces also targeted key infrastructure sites involved in the country's energy and defense sectors.

The Kuzmichi-1 oil pumping station, part of the crude oil transport network supplying Russia's southern regions, was among the facilities hit. Another strike targeted the Zenzevatka pumping station, which services the Kuybyshev-Tikhoretsk main oil pipeline.

Ukrainian forces struck a drone production facility in the village of Valuyki in Russia's Belgorod Oblast as well. While the full extent of the damage is still being assessed, a fire reportedly broke out at the site following the attack.

Ukraine's General Staff also confirmed that a long-range strike on Sept. 22 targeted the Astrakhan gas processing plant in southern Russia, forcing a partial shutdown of operations.

The facility, located in Russia's Astrakhan Oblast, is one of the world's largest gas chemical complexes and the country's primary producer of sulfur used in explosives, accounting for up to 66% of national output. The plant processes up to 3.2 million tons of oil products annually, according to the General Staff.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

Russia's parliament passed a bill in the first reading on Sept. 24 that would introduce year-round conscription, replacing spring and fall draft cycles, pro-government outlet Kommersant reported.

While conscripts are officially barred from being deployed abroad, reports indicate that many are pressured into signing contracts with Russia's Defense Ministry and sent to fight in Ukraine.

The bill would overhaul the existing system by allowing enlistment offices to conduct medical exams, psychological screenings, and draft board sessions throughout the year.

Under the proposed system, draft notices would be issued year-round.

The reform is meant to ease pressure on military commissariats, according to Andrei Kartapolov, chairman of the parliament's Defense Committee and the bill's author.

Russia drafts young men twice a year for one year of compulsory service.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's partial mobilization in 2022, the first since World War II, triggered protests across Russia and a mass exodus of more than 261,000 men.

Although the Kremlin declared mobilization "completed," it has never been officially ended by a decree.

Russian forces took an underage girl hostage to use her as a human shield after murdering her parents in a front-line village in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian 3rd Army Corps reported on Sept. 24.

The civilians were killed in the area of responsibility of the 3rd Army Corps, in the village of Shandryholove in Donetsk Oblast.

Ukrainian authorities have documented a number of cases of Russian troops murdering civilians in front-line areas since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, part of a wider pattern of abuse and repression.

"Russia is using (the captured girl) as a human shield for its unit advancing in the Lyman sector," the military unit said.

Even before the assault on the settlement, a Russian commander with the callsign "Bali" reportedly ordered his troops to "kill everyone indiscriminately," including the civilian population, "except for the children."

A video released by the 3rd Corps shows aerial footage of Russian troops taking the girl hostage, and includes intercepted audio of the Russian commander's orders.

A Russian unit broke into a house and killed the girl's parents before abducting her. She was then held hostage to prevent Ukrainian troops from opening fire during the ongoing battle, according to the military.

"All radio intercepts confirm that Russian actions were premeditated," the statement read.

Murdering civilians and using them as human shields constitutes a war crime under the Geneva Conventions.

Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine's former commander-in-chief, offered his first public assessment of Ukraine's 2024 cross-border operation in Russia's Kursk Oblast in an op-ed for the Ukrainian news outlet Mirror of the Week on Sept. 24.

"I don't know the cost of such actions, but it is clear that it was too high," he said.

Ukraine launched the unprecedented incursion in August 2024, advancing into Russian territory and seizing 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) within the first months.

The operation, planned by Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, sought to divert Russian troops from eastern Ukraine and disrupt Moscow's plans to invade Sumy Oblast, which borders Kursk Oblast.

Russia, reinforced by around 12,000 North Korean troops, launched a counter-offensive this spring that later forced Ukraine out of most of the captured Russian territory.

Zaluzhnyi, the current ambassador to the U.K., said that limited incursions can be undertaken, but practice showed they often failed to deliver long-term success.

"Practice has shown that, ultimately, an isolated tactical breakthrough on a narrow section of the front does not bring the necessary success to the attacking side," he wrote.

The former military chief added that Russia's forces had managed to leverage "technological and tactical advantages" to blunt Ukraine's gains and later counterattack.

Zaluzhnyi's comments contrast with Syrskyi's, who has consistently emphasized heavy Russian losses as the primary achievement of the Kursk campaign.

‘Very mean' animal, appearing out of nowhere and clawing and biting people's legs, still on the loose in Bay Area city

Residents of a San Francisco Bay Area city are on the lookout for an aggressive squirrel that has sent at least two people to the emergency room for medical treatment.

Joan Heblack told ABC affiliate KGO-TV that she was walking in the Lucas Valley neighborhood of San Rafael when a squirrel seemingly came out of nowhere and attacked her leg, clawing and biting.

“It clamped onto my leg. The tail was flying up here. I was like: ‘Get it off me, get off me!'” Heblack said.

Isabel Campoy also said she was attacked while walking in the same area. The squirrel launched itself from the ground to her face and wound up on her arm, leaving it bloody, she said.

Both women went to the emergency room, the TV station reported in its Monday story.

Flyers have now been posted, warning residents that the squirrel is no joke and that more than five people have been attacked by a “very mean squirrel” that “comes out of nowhere”.

Vanessa Potter of WildCare, a wildlife rescue organization in San Rafael, told KGO-TV that the aggressive behavior likely comes from the squirrel being fed and cared for by humans when it was a baby.

She said squirrels are not vectors for rabies. Experts say the public should not feed wild animals.

The city manager's office did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. San Rafael is in Marin county, about 20 miles (32km) north of San Francisco.

A broad draft Authorization for Use of Military Force could give wide latitude to go after supposed “narco-terrorists.”

A draft proposal to authorize the use of U.S. military force against drug cartels is currently floating around Congress and the White House, according to a recent New York Times report. Although an official version of the proposal has yet to be released, publicly available information suggests that it could be used to justify U.S. military intervention in at least 60 countries.

The U.S.-led “War on Drugs” has escalated rapidly over the last month: after the White House signed a secret directive authorizing attacks on Latin American drug cartels, the U.S. built up its military presence in the region and began conducting a series of deadly airstrikes on alleged drug-smuggling civilian boats in the international waters of the Caribbean. Human Rights Watch called the strikes “unlawful extrajudicial killings.”

How far Washington should go in its new counternarcotics campaign has been a source of controversy within the Trump administration. When the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) proposed the use of the U.S. military to attack cartels within Mexican territory during a White House meeting earlier this year, officials from the Defense Department and other agencies reportedly objected, in part because the executive branch lacked sufficient legal authorization to do so.

An “Authorization for Use of Military Force” (AUMF) is the instrument most often used to provide legal justification for military hostilities today. AUMF legislation passed in response to the 9/11 attacks laid the groundwork for a “Global War on Terror” that included targeting many suspects who had nothing to do with 9/11. Because of its extremely broad language, the 2001 AUMF has since been used to justify military interventions in at least 22 countries.

A proposal reportedly brought forth by Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) for a new AUMF aimed at “narco-terrorists” began circulating around Washington last week. Apparently modeled on the 2001 AUMF, Mills' new AUMF is similarly broad: although it only lasts for five years, the authorization does not identify specific targets and contains no geographic restrictions.

In comments given to the Times, Harvard Professor Jack Goldsmith described the proposal as “insanely broad,” essentially “an open-ended war authorization against an untold number of countries, organizations and persons that the president could deem within its scope.” The version of the AUMF that has been attributed to Rep. Mills would give the president the ability to use “all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations or persons the President determines are designated narco-terrorists,” including those who provide financing or support to narco-terrorists.

Earlier this year, the White House added a long list of Latin American drug cartels to the national “Foreign Terrorist Organizations” (FTO) list. Although the full text of Mills' AUMF hasn't been confirmed, under his reported proposal, the president could have the authority to wage war against any of these organizations, regardless of where they are operating. Given the highly globalized nature of the drug trade and the contested definition of who is included within “drug cartels,” this could include U.S. military action in dozens of different countries. Based on what is known about it so far, Mills' proposal would leave “a large amount of discretion in the hands of the executive to make determinations about who ‘counts' within the scope of targeting,” said Elizabeth Beavers, assistant professor of law at Widener University's Delaware Law School.

The Sinaloa Cartel, for example, designated as a FTO by the Trump administration in February, operates in “at least 47 countries,” according to the DEA. In a five–part series of articles on the “foreign policies of the Sinaloa Cartel and CJNG [another Mexican cartel]”, scholar Vanda Felbab-Brown lists some of the countries that are allegedly involved in the Sinaloa's activities: Albania, Australia, Belgium, Cape Verde, Chile, China, Colombia, the DRC, Ecuador, France, Germany, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Ireland, India, Italy, Mali, Morocco, Mozambique, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the “Northern Triangle” nations of Central America, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Peru, Portugal, Romania, Senegal, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, and the UK. Other countries with Sinaloa Cartel activity include Belize, Canada, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Guyana, Panama, and Thailand.

If the proposed AUMF had targeted the Sinaloa Cartel alone, it could theoretically authorize U.S. military interventions in at least 42 nations. But this is only one of many cartels that has been designated as a terrorist organization by the Trump administration. War against the CJNG would add Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Turkey, Uruguay, and Venezuela to the list. Cartels like Tren de Aragua have an established presence in Costa Rica. Meanwhile, the Trump administration designated several more countries as high-priority drug transit routes, specifically arguing that our “assistance” was “vital to the national interests of the United States” in Afghanistan, Bolivia, Colombia, Myanmar, and Venezuela.

Taken together, the combined forces of the proposed AUMF and the terrorist designations for cartels could allow the U.S. president to intervene in almost every nation in the continental Americas. Taken literally, the AUMF might even be abused to justify hostilities within the United States, as the terrorist-designated MS-13 gang was created in Los Angeles and maintains extensive operations throughout the U.S. In practice, however, this is highly unlikely.

“There are still a whole host of constitutional protections against extrajudicial targeting of persons within the U.S. that an AUMF doesn't just sweep away,” said Beavers. Still, this assumes that the president would be willing to abide by these protections. “This entire conversation about lawfulness rests entirely on what the other branches of government, including the courts, are willing to do about such violations,” she added.

U.S. authorities have long tried to expand their power by blending together the War on Drugs and the War on Terror, often using the controversial idea of “narco-terrorism” to make the connection. In 2011, the DEA claimed that 39% of Foreign Terrorist Organizations had “confirmed links to the drug trade.” This newly-proposed AUMF could therefore be applied to many traditional terrorist organizations, including al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, and the Taliban. This means the AUMF could provide additional authorities (on top of those from prior AUMFs) for the U.S. to involve itself in the countries where these groups operate. Such a list would likely include the Taliban's involvement in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Hezbollah's involvement in Lebanon, and a long list of countries alleged by the U.S. government to have al-Qaeda affiliates: Algeria, Burkina Faso, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen.

The U.S. has also long accused the Colombian National Liberation Army (ELN) of narco-trafficking. Because of Cuba's involvement in negotiations between the ELN and the Colombian government, Washington has insisted upon the classification of the island nation as a “State Sponsor of Terrorism.” Thus, the White House could theoretically use this proposed AUMF to engage in military hostilities in Cuba. Similarly, U.S. attempts at linking Venezuela's government leadership with an alleged “Cartel of the Suns” could be used to engage in a war against the Venezuelan military, not just the cartels alleged to operate within the nation.

Adding together all of these potential applications of the proposed AUMF, the bill would create justifications for the White House to engage in offensive military activity in more than 60 nations. While there's currently no indication that Congress is eager to take up, let alone pass, an extremely broad new military force authorization, if it were to become law, it would fully merge two of the largest policy failures in U.S. history — the War on Drugs and the War on Terror — into one singular concept that could expand armed conflict throughout the entire Western hemisphere and beyond.

A spokesperson for Turning Point USA said that Jimmy Kimmel's comments on his show after he returned on Tuesday from an ABC suspension are not sufficient, asserting that the late-night TV host made false statements that need correcting.

Andrew Kolvet, a spokesperson for the group that was co-founded by Charlie Kirk in 2012, said that Kimmel needs to address his previous comments before ABC suspended him this past week.

A Christian summer camp where 27 children died in a flash flood will reopen, to the outrage of the victims' families.

The owners of Camp Mystic in Texas announced reconstruction plans on Monday in a series of emails that were sent to the victims' families and former campers.

Camp Mystic's bosses looked forward to “rebuilding cabins and trails” that were swept away by the floods, the emails said, according to the New York Times.

“We are not only rebuilding cabins and trails, but also a place where laughter, friendship and spiritual growth will continue to flourish,” an email to past campers read.

“We look forward to welcoming you back inside the green gates.”

The new facility will open at the camp's second site close to the Guadalupe River, which burst its banks on July 4, killing a total of 135 people at the girls-only summer camp in Kerrville.

The river is a well-studied, high-risk flood zone, according to mapped data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema).

The disaster was one of the most lethal floods in US history, with a death toll of at least 120 people — including 36 children. Three people are still missing.

Authorities faced questions about a series of apparent safety failings in the aftermath of the flood, including the location of some of the cabins and an insufficient flood warning system.

The rebuilt cabins will not be in the same location, it is understood.

The camp's reopening has been met with fury from victims' families, especially as one child, Cile Steward, eight, remains missing.

Her mother, Cici, released a statement on Tuesday condemning plans to reopen the camp. She said: “The truth is, Camp Mystic failed our daughters.

“Recovery teams are still out there, scouring the river, risking and sacrificing so much to find her so we can finally lay her to rest.

“For their efforts, we are eternally grateful. Camp Mystic, however, has only added to our grief,” she wrote.

She accused the camp of engaging in a “brief pause before business as usual”.

She added: “Camp Mystic is pressing ahead with reopening, even if it means inviting girls to swim in the same river that may potentially still hold my daughter's body.”

Camp Mystic also plans to build a memorial on the camp dedicated to those who were killed in the floods earlier this summer.

Blake Bonner, the father of Lila, nine, who died in the flood, said the families who lost loved ones in July were “not consulted and did not approve this memorial”.

The emails that were sent out on Monday were signed by members of the Eastland family, who have owned the camp for nearly a century.

Richard “Dick” Eastland, who was the camp's director at the time of the flooding, died trying to save girls from the flooding.

He was accused of failing to evacuate campers until an hour after the first official alert warning of oncoming catastrophic Texas floods.

According to the Washington Post, he had notified some staff about the flood alert, which did not have an evacuation notice, and told them to “monitor the situation”.

A statement released by the Eastland family on Tuesday said they had received “no negative comments from any of the bereaved families regarding plans to build a memorial.”

But Mr Bonner believes the camp's resources should remain focused on finding Cile's body.

The search for her body has become a rallying point for the families of the deceased, forming what they call “Heaven's 27”.

The group is calling for legislation in Texas to implement camp safety reforms, including by building new cabins and moving existing ones away from floodplains.

Ukraine carried out strikes on multiple targets in Russia linked to oil refining and drone production, Ukraine's General Staff confirmed on Sept. 24.

The confirmation follows a reported overnight attack on the Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat petrochemical plant in Russia's Republic of Bashkortostan.

The General Staff said the strike hit the oil refining facility in the Republic of Bashkortostan, specifically the ELOU-AVT-6 primary oil refining unit. Preliminary reports indicate the attack caused a fire at the site.

The Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat facility is one of Russia's largest oil refining and petrochemical plants, producing 150 different types of products, including gasoline and diesel fuel. It is located some 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from the front line in Ukraine.

The targeted facility processes up to 10 million tons of oil annually and is a key producer of liquid rocket fuel for Russia, according to the General Staff.

In addition to the strike on the oil refinery in the Republic of Bashkortostan, Ukrainian forces also targeted key infrastructure sites involved in the country's energy and defense sectors.

The Kuzmichi-1 oil pumping station, part of the crude oil transport network supplying Russia's southern regions, was among the facilities hit. Another strike targeted the Zenzevatka pumping station, which services the Kuybyshev-Tikhoretsk main oil pipeline.

Ukrainian forces struck a drone production facility in the village of Valuyki in Russia's Belgorod Oblast as well. While the full extent of the damage is still being assessed, a fire reportedly broke out at the site following the attack.

Ukraine's General Staff also confirmed that a long-range strike on Sept. 22 targeted the Astrakhan gas processing plant in southern Russia, forcing a partial shutdown of operations.

The facility, located in Russia's Astrakhan Oblast, is one of the world's largest gas chemical complexes and the country's primary producer of sulfur used in explosives, accounting for up to 66% of national output. The plant processes up to 3.2 million tons of oil products annually, according to the General Staff.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

Ukrainian forces have intensified attacks on Russia's oil industry over the past year, forcing operational suspensions and exacerbating a nationwide fuel shortage.

Kyiv considers Russian oil refineries, petrochemical facilities, as well as military production sites, to be valid military targets as they help fund Moscow's war machine.

A growing number of Poles believe Ukraine should give up claims to regions that voted to join Russia in referendums, in order to reach a peace settlement, according to a new survey.

A United Surveys poll for Wirtualna Polska published on Tuesday found that almost 42% of respondents believe Ukraine should drop its territorial claims for security guarantees and peace. Of the 1,000 Polish adults of voting age surveyed in late-August, 48% were against giving up land claims for peace, with 10% undecided.A survey published only last month by Rzeczpospolita found 37.4% supported concessions, while 50.5% opposed them.

Moscow has long insisted that Kiev recognize Crimea, Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, and Zaporozhye as Russian territory in any peace deal. Kiev has rejected this, with Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky vowing last month to retake Crimea – largely populated by ethnic Russians – which voted to join Russia after the 2014 Western-backed coup in Kiev. He also pledged to reclaim the four other regions, which joined Russia in 2022, saying “it's only a matter of time.”

Poland has been one of Ukraine's top donors since 2022, providing over €5.1 billion ($5.7 billion) in aid – more than 70% of it as weapons – according to Germany's Kiel Institute. Warsaw is also part of the “coalition of the willing,” advocating continued military aid.

However, support for Kiev among Polish citizens has been steadily declining. Backing for Ukraine's EU membership dropped to 35% and NATO membership to 37% in June this year, down from 85% and 75% respectively in February 2022, according to a recent IBRiS survey. Prime Minister Donald Tusk admitted to “a growing wave of pro-Russian sentiment and antipathy towards a struggling Ukraine” in a post on X earlier this month.

On Sunday, an anti-war rally took place in Warsaw, with demonstrators waving national flags and carrying placards denouncing Poland's involvement in the conflict and military aid for Kiev. Videos and photos posted on social media showed banners reading “Poland is for peace” and “We say no to warmongers.”

Moscow has repeatedly warned that foreign aid only prolongs the conflict and urged a diplomatic solution. It insists any settlement must include Ukrainian neutrality, demilitarization, and recognition of the current territorial reality – including the status of its new regions.

The Israeli cycling team that has been a focus for pro-Palestinian protests said on Wednesday it was reviewing its branding for next year as sponsors pressured for a name change.

The Israel-Premier Tech team took their full name off riders' jerseys for the recent Vuelta a Espana, which was halted early due to a plethora of protests over the Gaza war.

Some media have reported the word Israel may be removed in the future, but the team did not confirm that.

“The team is currently in the planning phase for 2026 team branding and will communicate any potential changes in due course,” Israel-Premier Tech said in a message to Reuters.

The team is owned by Canadian-Israeli businessman Sylvan Adams and has an Israeli licence.

One of its sponsors, U.K.-based Factor Bikes, has said its support was conditional on disassociating from Israel.

“Without a name change, without a flag change, we won't continue,” its founder Rob Gitelis told Cyclingnews.

Another sponsor, Canadian-based manufacturer and horticulture firm Premier Tech, expressed a similar stance in a statement published by some media this week.

“We are sensitive and attentive to the situation on the international scene, which has evolved considerably since our arrival on the World Tour in 2017,” it said, adding that it had always supported cyclists from Quebec and Canada.

“However, the current situation regarding the team name is no longer sustainable to achieve our goal, which is the very reason for our involvement in cycling.”

Neither company could immediately be reached for comment.

Politicians in Kyiv and Moscow were left scratching their heads Wednesday, trying to understand Donald Trump's latest about-face on the war, after the U.S. President posted on social media that he now believed Ukraine could emerge victorious.

Ukrainian politicians were delighted, and Russian figures openly baffled, by the latest twist, which came barely a month after Mr. Trump greeted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House with a situation map and told Mr. Zelensky that Russia was “so clearly much more powerful” than Ukraine. Both sides are now wondering whether Mr. Trump intends to back up his latest position with any new help for Ukraine's war effort.

Mr. Trump posted Tuesday on his Truth Social platform that “after getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia Military and Economic situation” he believed that – with the support of the European Union and NATO – Ukraine “is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.”

It was yet another stark reversal on Russia and Ukraine from Mr. Trump, who came to office boasting that he could end the war in 24 hours. As recently as the Aug. 19 meeting in the White House – which followed a face-to-face summit in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin – Mr. Trump was pushing Ukraine to accept a peace deal that would allow Russia to keep the roughly 20 per cent of Ukrainian territory it has conquered since February, 2022.

Mr. Trump has also whiplashed between blaming Mr. Zelensky and his own predecessor, Joe Biden, for “starting” a war he viewed as unwinnable (Mr. Putin instigated the conflict by ordering an full-scale invasion of Ukraine), and expressing disappointment with Mr. Putin's unwillingness to make peace.

“It's an unexpected and yet important shift in his stance on Ukraine, and it differs starkly from his previous position when Trump was thinking that Russia is winning the war,” Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of the Ukrainian parliament's foreign affairs committee, told The Globe and Mail on Wednesday. “At the same time what also matters is not only his rhetoric, however positive, but also Trump's actions.”

Speaking to a Fox News interviewer shortly after Mr. Trump posted his new thinking online, Mr. Zelensky said he believed Mr. Trump no longer expected Ukraine to accept a land-for-peace deal to end the war. “I think he understands, for today, that we can't just swap territories. It's not fair,” Mr. Zelensky said.

In his address to the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday, the Ukrainian leader seemed to be working hard to keep the U.S. President onside, condemning last year's assassination attempt against Mr. Trump – “God saved him from a murder attempt” – as well as the recent killing of pro-Trump commentator Charlie Kirk. Mr. Zelensky's speech also echoed Mr. Trump's position on Gaza – he said only that the hostages held by Hamas “must be freed” – and criticisms of the UN that Mr. Trump had levelled in his own speech to the General Assembly on Tuesday.

In his lengthy post, Mr. Trump also referenced reports of gasoline shortages in parts of Russia and said “Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act.” In recent weeks, Ukrainian special forces units – using mostly domestically produced drones – have carried out a series of long-distance strikes targeting Russia's oil-and-gas infrastructure. 

Mr. Merezhko said that while Kyiv was still waiting to see the U.S. impose tough new tariffs and sanctions on Moscow – as Mr. Trump has been threatening to do for months – Mr. Trump's words could be seen as green-lighting Ukraine's use of U.S.-made weapons to strike even deeper into Russia.

Kyiv-based political analyst Peter Zalmayev, however, cautioned that Ukraine needed to “be careful not to keep riding on this Trumpian rollercoaster. This sort of shift in rhetoric can be interpreted many ways.” 

Mr. Trump could be seen as setting the stage for walking away from the war by saying Ukraine could win with European support alone, Mr. Zalmayev said. “Donald Trump is always in this constant mode of gaslighting and drawing attention to things that he will later then disavow.”

Russian politicians, meanwhile, scorned Mr. Trump's new interpretation of events, suggesting that he'd been swayed by meetings with Mr. Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron on the sidelines of the UN meeting in New York.

“After meeting with the clowns from Kyiv and Paris, he published a vivid post. In this new reality, everything is different. Kyiv is winning, Russia is torn to shreds,” former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev wrote on Telegram on Wednesday. 

During a quick pull-aside meeting at the UN, Trump emphasized his new position that Ukraine can win back all territory lost to Russia during a bilateral meeting with Macron.

The Associated Press

Mr. Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of Russia's National Security Council – and who already had a social-media spat with Mr. Trump earlier this year – said it wouldn't be surprising to see Mr. Trump reverse course again and call on Ukraine to surrender. “I have no doubt he will return,” to Russia's side, Mr. Medvedev wrote. “He always returns.”

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Mr. Trump's words would have no impact on the battlefield, where Russian troops continue take heavy losses as they grind slowly forward.

“The fact that Ukraine is being encouraged in every possible way to continue hostilities and the argument that Ukraine can win something back is, in our view, a mistaken argument,” Mr. Peskov said. “The dynamics on the front lines speak for themselves.”

A situation report published Monday by the Kyiv-based Centre for Defence Strategies found that Moscow would likely fail to achieve its military objective of capturing all of southeastern Ukraine by the end of 2025. CDS forecast, however, that key cities including Pokrovsk, in the Donetsk region, and Kupyansk, in the Kharkiv region, would fall to Russian troops in the coming months “provided current dynamics of combat operations are maintained.”

Russia's parliament passed a bill in the first reading on Sept. 24 that would introduce year-round conscription, replacing spring and fall draft cycles, pro-government outlet Kommersant reported.

While conscripts are officially barred from being deployed abroad, reports indicate that many are pressured into signing contracts with Russia's Defense Ministry and sent to fight in Ukraine.

The bill would overhaul the existing system by allowing enlistment offices to conduct medical exams, psychological screenings, and draft board sessions throughout the year. 

Under the proposed system, draft notices would be issued year-round.

The reform is meant to ease pressure on military commissariats, according to Andrei Kartapolov, chairman of the parliament's Defense Committee and the bill's author. 

Russia drafts young men twice a year for one year of compulsory service. 

Russian President Vladimir Putin's partial mobilization in 2022, the first since World War II, triggered protests across Russia and a mass exodus of more than 261,000 men. 

Although the Kremlin declared mobilization "completed," it has never been officially ended by a decree.

Since then, Moscow has sought to avoid another large-scale mobilization by ramping up contract recruitment, offering financial incentives to volunteers.

Igor Krasnov, ex-prosecutor general known for his pivotal role in the Kremlin's crackdown on dissent, was the sole candidate for the role.



One of the largest oil refineries in Russia, the Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat petrochemical plant in the Republic of Bashkortostan, came under Ukrainian attack overnight on Sept. 24.

The cyberattack disrupted automated check-in systems caused flight cancellations and delays at several major European airports.

Construction continues at the Lithium Nevada Corp. mine site Tracker Pass project on April 24, 2023, near Orovada, NevRick Bowmer/The Associated Press

U.S.-listed shares of Lithium Americas (LAC-N, LAC-T) jumped 93.5 per cent on Wednesday after it was reported that the Trump administration is seeking up to a 10 per cent stake in the miner, in the latest sign of Washington's intervention into industries it considers critical to national security.

Late Tuesday, Reuters cited two people familiar with the talks who said the administration is considering the stake as part of negotiations over a US$2.26-billion Department of Energy loan for the company's Thacker Pass lithium project in Nevada, the largest planned lithium mine in the Western Hemisphere.

Vancouver-based Lithium Americas said on Wednesday it was in discussions with the U.S. energy department and General Motors over the Thacker Pass loan.

The move underscores President Donald Trump's increasing use of direct government ownership to steer strategic sectors and curb reliance on China, which dominates refining of many critical minerals.

China produces over 40,000 metric tons of lithium annually, ranking third after Australia and Chile, but dominates refining, processing more than 75 per cent of the world's lithium into battery-grade material.

TD Cowen analysts said a government stake would lend credence to the Thacker Pass project completion and expansion to multiple phases with perhaps enhanced economics.

The project is seen as a linchpin in building a domestic supply chain part of Washington's long-standing drive to boost U.S. production of lithium, a metal used to make batteries for electric vehicles and other electronics.

The Trump administration recently moved to take a stake in chipmaker Intel following a deal that would make the Department of Defense the largest shareholder in rare earths MP Materials. Jefferies said the administration's preference for equity stakes, viewed as lower political cost than tax increases, can support financing, corporate profits, and favorable returns on invested capital.

Lithium Americas' Canadian and U.S.-listed shares were both up about 90 per cent at $8.04 and US$5.80, respectively. The company had a market value of US$744.5-million as of last close on the New York Stock Exchange.

GM, which invested US$625-million in the mine last year for a 38 per cent stake, has the right to buy all of the project's lithium from its first phase and a portion from the second phase for 20 years, although Trump officials are now seeking a guarantee that GM will buy the metal, according to the sources.

NBCFM Research analyst Mohamed Sidibe said the MP Materials-DoD model shows how government equity, long-term offtake, and price support can derisk strategic projects.

He added for Lithium Americas, a similar approach could strengthen funding and project durability, though it may dilute existing shareholders.

The Thacker Pass project is expected to begin production in 2028.

Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein said an equity stake could include offtake price guarantees, potentially making Thacker Pass profitable even if lithium prices remain lower for longer.

The news also lifted other lithium miners in premarket trading. Albemarle gained 5.5 per cent while Sigma Lithium climbed 9 per cent. U.S.-listed shares of SQM rose 3.3 per cent.

Hundreds of US government employees who lost their jobs in Elon Musk's cost-cutting drive are being asked to return to work.

The General Services Administration (GSA) – which manages government workspaces – has given its former employees until the end of the week to accept or decline reinstatement, according to an internal memo obtained by the Associated Press.

Those who accept must report for duty on Oct 6 after what amounts to a seven-month paid leave.

Mr Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) identified the GSA, which had about 12,000 employees at the start of the Trump administration, as a chief target of its campaign to reduce fraud, waste and abuse in the federal government.

Starting in March, thousands of GSA employees left the agency in programs that encouraged them to resign or take early retirement.

A small cohort of Mr Musk's trusted aides stayed in the GSA's headquarters, sometimes sleeping in cots on the agency's sixth floor, and pursued plans to cancel nearly half of the 7,500 leases in the federal portfolio.

Doge also wanted the GSA to sell hundreds of federally owned buildings with the goal of generating billions in savings, publishing a list of hundreds of government buildings that were targeted for sale.

The GSA sent more than 800 lease cancellation notices to landlords, in many cases without informing the tenants.

Pushback against the GSA's dumping of its portfolio was swift, and both initiatives had been scaled back. More than 480 leases put forward for termination by Doge have since been spared.

The leases were for offices scattered around the country that are occupied by such agencies as the Internal Revenue Service, Social Security Administration and Food and Drug Administration.

Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official, said: “Ultimately, the outcome was the agency was left broken and understaffed.

“They didn't have the people they needed to carry out basic functions.”

Mr Becker, who represents owners with government leases at Arco Real Estate Solutions, said GSA had been in a “triage mode” for months.

He said the sudden reversal of the downsizing reflected how Mr Musk and Doge had gone too far, too fast.

Doge's “wall of receipts,” which once boasted that the lease cancellations alone would save nearly $460m, has since reduced that estimate to $140m by the end of July, according to Mr Becker.

Recommended

As part of its cost-cutting drive, the GSA cut the GSA's headquarters staff by 79 per cent, its portfolio managers by 65 per cent and facilities managers by 35 per cent, according to a federal official.

The official, who was not authorised to speak to the media, provided the statistics on condition of anonymity.

Because of the internal turmoil, 131 leases expired without the government actually vacating the properties, the official said.

The situation has exposed the agencies to steep fees because property owners have not been able to rent out those spaces to other tenants.

David Marroni, a senior official at the Government Accountability Office, said the congressional watchdog is examining the GSA's management of its workforce, lease terminations and planned building disposals, and expects to issue findings in the coming months.

U.S. President Donald Trump's Sept. 23 comment that NATO allies should shoot down Russian aircraft that violate their airspace drew positive reactions from Estonia and Poland.

The endorsements come amid rising tension in NATO's eastern flank following a series of airspace breaches, which have challenged alliance protocols on intercepts, escalation, and collective defense.

"Roger that," said Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, signaling his country's support for Trump's position. 

Marko Mihkelson, chairman of the Estonian Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote on social media, "we got it," echoing a brisk acceptance in Tallinn.

Estonia's foreign minister, Margus Tsahkna, earlier told the Kyiv Independent that the Baltic state and its allies must be prepared to both intercept and, if necessary, down aircraft that violate its sovereign airspace.

"The message must be unequivocal: future violations will meet a response — including, if necessary, the interception and downing of intruding aircraft," Tsahkna said on Sept. 23. "This is not only about defending Estonia's borders — it's about defending NATO's borders."

The reactions follow several recent incidents that raised alarm among NATO members.

Three Russian MiG-31 fighters entered Estonian airspace on Sept. 19 over the Gulf of Finland for roughly 12 minutes before departing, prompting Tallinn to request consultations under NATO's Article 4. 

Days earlier, Poland shot down Russian drones that entered its airspace during a mass attack on Ukraine, the first direct engagement of Russian military assets over NATO territory since the war began.

NATO scrambled two Eurofighter jets over the Baltic Sea on Sept. 21 after an Il-20M reconnaissance plane was detected flying without a filed flight plan. 

The alliance also launched the Eastern Sentry mission to reinforce air defenses along its eastern flank.

Czech President Petr Pavel said on Sept. 20 that NATO needs to stay united and respond decisively to Russian provocations, including by a potential military action.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS News that NATO had not discussed shooting down Russian jets unless they were attacking and that standard practice remains interception.

"Georgia is dependent on Russia, and for many, many years, Belarus has been moving toward dependence on Russia," Volodymyr Zelensky said. "Europe cannot afford to lose Moldova too."

Viktoriia Roshchyna disappeared in August 2023 while reporting in Russian-occupied territories. Russian authorities confirmed her detention the following year.

Igor Krasnov, ex-prosecutor general known for his pivotal role in the Kremlin's crackdown on dissent, was the sole candidate for the role.



One of the largest oil refineries in Russia, the Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat petrochemical plant in the Republic of Bashkortostan, came under Ukrainian attack overnight on Sept. 24.

The cyberattack disrupted automated check-in systems caused flight cancellations and delays at several major European airports.

Despite security precautions, a direct hit against a shelter made it impossible to fully prevent casualties, according to the military.

While conscripts are officially barred from being deployed abroad, reports indicate that many are pressured into signing contracts with Russia's Defense Ministry and sent to fight in Ukraine.

The A330 aircraft was traveling to Lithuania's Siauliai air base, reportedly also carrying relatives of Spanish air force personnel deployed as part of a NATO air policing mission.

The Caspian Pipeline Consortium confirmed that its office in the city was damaged. 

"I don't know the cost of such actions, but it is clear that it was too high," said Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine's former commander-in-chief.

“Jimmy Kimmel Live” returned to ABC's late-night television on Sept. 23, after being suspended for six-days over controversial remarks the host made on air about the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.

The late-night show was suspended after Kimmel said in his monologue that “many in MAGA land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk” and that “the MAGA gang” was “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.” MAGA stands for President Donald Trump's “Make America Great Again” policy agenda.

UN, September 24. /TASS/. Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov has called for an immediate end to the genocide of the Palestinian people and urged recognition of Palestine's independence during the session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

"We demand an immediate halt to the genocide against the Palestinians and the launch of an international judicial investigation by the UN International Court of Justice," Japarov declared. In his view, the global community must not remain indifferent to the human tragedy unfolding "before the eyes of the entire world."

He stressed that Kyrgyzstan firmly condemns violence and terrorism in all forms, including the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. "Such terrorists must be punished severely. However, there are established methods and procedures for combating terrorism and eliminating terrorists. These are the methods that should be employed," he explained.

Japarov went on to insist that the recognition of Palestinian independence is essential. "The only path to a lasting peace is the realization of the two-state principle. Palestine must achieve independence based on the 1967 borders," he said.

The Kyrgyz leader also voiced opposition to missile strikes on Qatar and Iran. "We likewise condemn the recent rocket attacks on the territories of Qatar and Iran, as such actions are an infringement on the sovereignty of independent states, pose a threat to regional stability and security, and violate the norms of international law," Japarov emphasized.

MINNEAPOLIS—A 12-year-old girl shot in the head during the deadly attack at a Catholic church in Minneapolis less than a month ago is making “miraculous” progress, her family said in a statement.

Sophia Forchas, who was the most seriously wounded child among those who survived the shooting at the Church of the Annunciation, will move this week from acute care to an inpatient rehabilitation program, her family said.

 How Profit Seeking Distorts American Policymaking

 Don Graves, Jr., and Aroop Mukharji

Until recently, few policy tools united Democrats and Republicans like export controls. Restrictions on the spread of dual-use U.S. technology such as semiconductors became the policy of choice in the tech race against China and as a means of punishing Russia for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In the wrong hands, semiconductors and certain other U.S. technologies can present national security risks. Politicians might have debated the details, but there was broad bipartisan agreement that the U.S. government should regulate the movement of these technologies.

The Trump administration has also embraced the use of export controls—but it has added a twist. In August, the administration brokered a revenue-sharing deal with Nvidia, a U.S. company that designs semiconductor chips used to power artificial intelligence. In exchange for export control licenses to sell its H20 chip to China, the company will now give 15 percent of its revenue from those sales to the U.S. government. Previously, the U.S. government reviewed license applications to ensure transactions did not present unacceptable risks. This time, the administration replaced that process with a price tag, prioritizing side payments to the government over security interests.

Although Beijing banned Chinese companies from buying Nvidia's chips last week, after accusing the company of violating antimonopoly laws, the Trump administration's deal is part of a worrying trend: the monetization of national security. Instead of treating security as an indivisible, priceless ideal—similar to free and fair elections, free speech, or freedom of religion—the administration is treating U.S. national security as if it were a portfolio of divisible, priceable assets. What once was security is now securities. Worse, the prices appear to be negotiable: the president revealed in a press conference that the administration had sought a 20 percent cut of Nvidia's sales but settled for 15.

Reducing national security to dollars and cents does not just distort the term's meaning; it also makes the United States less secure. Replacing licenses with revenue-sharing deals, making certain types of direct investments, and squeezing U.S. allies and partners may all help fill U.S. government coffers. But policies designed to maximize short-term gain can create new security problems and leave the old ones unsolved. They will enable U.S. technology to more easily reach American adversaries, cost the U.S. government oversight over taxpayer money, and sacrifice Washington's ability to shape the world around it.

Avoiding these dangers and reducing the U.S. economy's exposure to risk requires a careful, farsighted strategy that recognizes the reality of the United States' place in today's world. True economic security will remain out of reach as long as the government is run as a business, its policy levers and relationships priced, bundled, and repriced, available to be bought and sold.

Economic concerns were fundamental to national security when the term was first introduced in national debate, about a century ago. As the historians Peter Roady and Andrew Preston have recently documented, during his 1932 election campaign and following presidential term, Franklin Roosevelt deliberately defined the phrase to capture risks to domestic economic well-being. In his second fireside chat in 1933, Roosevelt argued that economic struggle led to “incalculable” social harm and a “loss of that sense of security.” A new domestic economic program was “imperative to our national security,” he declared, later summarizing, “Freedom from fear is eternally linked with freedom from want.”

Roosevelt's original interpretation of national security later gave way to a more militarized, more expansive conception, reinforced by the interests of a growing arms industry and the rise of the modern military-industrial complex. It came to encompass every corner of the world. This focus on military and ideological competition reigned supreme into the early years of the twenty-first century, even as Washington began paying greater attention to the financial tools it could use to contain threats from terrorist groups and rogue states after the 9/11 attacks.

In the 2010s and early 2020s, Roosevelt's vision of the economic and domestic dimensions of national security made a bipartisan comeback. The second line of the Obama administration's 2015 National Security Strategy affirmed that “America's growing economic strength is the foundation of our national security.” In his first term, Trump championed the same idea. “For the first time,” he remarked on releasing his 2017 National Security Strategy, “American strategy recognizes that economic security is national security.”



Four years later, President Joe Biden's 2021 interim national security guidance repeated the same mantra: “Economic security is national security.” Biden's Department of Commerce played a greater role in national security policy than anyone in government could remember, not just with export controls but also in work on supply chains, cybersecurity, information and communication technology, climate change, investment security, law enforcement, commercial diplomacy, standards development, patents, domestic investment, and even commercial space policy. There was substantial bipartisan alignment on many of these issues. Republicans were especially supportive of the department's export control policies, and in late 2023, Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis proposed establishing a federal office of economic security and competition—with a mandate similar to that of new offices the Biden administration had created earlier that year, including the Commerce Department's Supply Chain Center and the Office of Economic Security and Emerging Technology, part of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

It is not simply that economic, technology, and trade policy became more appealing arrows in the national security quiver. That did happen. But more significantly, on a philosophical level, leading Democrats and Republicans agreed that security itself meant much more than an absence of physical attack. It also meant reducing economic struggle and risk. They saw economic security as a domestic issue as much as an international one. The erosion of strategic U.S. industries and the loss of technological leadership, for instance, could leave the United States vulnerable to foreign actors who might weaponize trade dependencies. The supply chain disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic showed just how easily the country could lose access to critical goods. The first Trump administration's relentless focus on manufacturing domestically to rely less on others and its concern that Huawei and TikTok could give the Chinese government access to American data, furthermore, continued into the Biden administration. With notable exceptions, such as export controls, Democratic and Republican policy solutions were not always the same, but everyone largely agreed on what the problem was.

The second Trump administration is challenging this consensus. Traditionally, national security has been about reducing threats; now, the administration seeks to profit from them, ostensibly in the eventual hope of cutting taxes for the public benefit. The H20 chip deal with Nvidia is one way it has done this, by allowing a company whose business with China presents a national security threat to buy off that risk. Trump has said that H20 chips are “obsolete” products that China “already has,” suggesting that selling them presents no risk to the United States. The point is moot in this case if Beijing keeps a ban on Nvidia's chips in place. But in principle, a riskless export control license is an oxymoron; licenses are required only when the government has identified a risk. It did so for the H20 chip just a few months ago, in April. This is the reason paying for export control licenses is prohibited under U.S. law (Title 50 of the U.S. Code), to prevent a situation in which financial gain takes precedence over national security concerns. When export controls are about money rather than security standards, U.S. technology will easily reach malign actors.

Possible legal complications, however, have not stopped the Trump administration from pursuing this kind of arrangement. It has already reached a deal with another technology company, AMD, to give the U.S. government 15 percent of its revenue from selling its MI308 processors in China—something Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (whose department does not oversee dual-use export controls) called a “beta test.”

The administration could continue to replicate this model, and not just in export control cases. It could, for example, try to generate cash for the federal government by accepting payment in exchange for the approval of foreign direct investment in U.S. companies, wiping away potential national security concerns for the right price. If an investment presents any kind of concern, such as data security, however, pretending the problem does not exist because someone has agreed to pay the government is not a real solution. And left unresolved, a national security problem will only fester.

The monetization of national security has not been limited to revenue-sharing deals. The administration is also exploring direct investment in U.S. companies. Most notably, the government announced in August that it was purchasing a ten percent stake (roughly $8.9 billion) in Intel, the United States' largest semiconductor manufacturer. Unlike revenue-sharing deals, direct investment is unusual but not unprecedented. There can be legitimate reasons for the government to invest in a company that is critical to national security and needs help. For instance, a struggling company that faces closure or a foreign takeover might need both cash and strategic guidance. Or a startup that is not yet generating revenue may need public investment when private capital is not an option. But making money should not be the primary goal—a single company's payouts to the government should not be prioritized above nationwide security interests.



The Intel deal illustrates this risk. Federal money was already promised to Intel through grants from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act; this money came with protections attached to ensure it was used to advance the public interest. The largest grant supported manufacturing projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon, and the company was obligated to report on project milestones and follow national security guardrails that, among other things, limited its activities with foreign countries of concern. Also embedded in the grant program was a provision to return money to taxpayers in the case of unanticipated profits, called “upside sharing.”

But instead of continuing to disburse grant money and keeping these protections in place, the U.S. government opted for equity. This meant more cash up front for Intel and potentially more future revenue for the federal government but—critically—a significant loss of oversight of taxpayer dollars. Intel may decide to use those dollars in ways that support national security interests. Or it may not.

Finally, the administration has monetized national security through its approach to U.S. military support and foreign aid, helping others if it brings a financial return. “Taiwan should pay us for defense,” the then candidate Trump said in 2024. “You know, we're no different than an insurance company.” Shortly after Trump's election, Taiwan pledged to increase its spending on U.S. weapons; in the early months of his presidency, Trump's frequent complaints about allied free-riding pressured others to do the same. The administration followed a similar mercenary logic in pursuing a critical minerals deal with Ukraine in exchange for Washington's continued support for Kyiv's war effort and in canceling U.S. foreign aid across the globe. To replace a “charity-based model” of development assistance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote in July, the administration would instead seek investment opportunities that produce “a multiplier effect” that benefits the private sector.

Yet likening aid to an insurance policy or a market venture misses the greatest strategic value of supporting others. Take development aid. Aside from the compelling morality of alleviating human suffering, this aid can provide a bulwark against foreign manipulation, the emergence of terrorist havens, the growth of black markets, and other security threats that arise from chronic underdevelopment and economic struggle. Those interests, like so many others—nuclear nonproliferation, maintaining robust alliances, supporting democracy—have little to do with immediate financial returns.

To call the Trump administration's approach to national security transactionalism misses the bigger point. Transactionalism assumes an exchange, tit for tat. But the administration instead is trading an intangible for a tangible: security interests for cold, hard cash. In doing so, it betrays a fundamentally different view of what national security is—one that suggests security can be priced at all.

At best, the administration's pursuit of profit distracts Washington from solving national security concerns; at worst, it deepens those threats. Monetization can even create new vulnerabilities and sources of insecurity by incentivizing affluent players to join the game. Take, for instance, Qatar's gift of a gleaming $400 million airplane to transport the U.S. president. In the administration's eagerness to accept a golden egg, it has created a golden espionage opportunity by inviting foreign surveillance.

The core problem with monetizing national security interests is that it contradicts the basic principles of economic security. This subset of national security includes protecting the U.S. economy, critical infrastructure, and American well-being; building national resilience to disruptions; and generally ensuring the safe and stable flourishing of American society. Truly advancing economic security requires that policymakers navigate tradeoffs, recognize that other countries hold leverage, engage partners, and play the long game.

Maintaining a bird's-eye view of tradeoffs and tensions in economic security policy is essential to making wise decisions. Economic actions taken on behalf of national security, such as export controls, could have the unintended effect of limiting economic growth and innovation. Likewise, some actions taken in the pursuit of economic growth and innovation, such as export promotion and scientific collaboration, may undermine national security if those exports and research products are used to threaten Americans. The pitfall to avoid is creating new sources of insecurity or areas of misunderstanding. An action to resolve one risk should not create an even greater risk. For instance, the Trump administration's early approach to tariffs—massive, punitive, and blunt—roiled the market and created economic uncertainty that even the president could not stomach. More narrowly targeted trade arrangements would help minimize adverse effects on American consumers, producers, and investors. They would also ensure the clarity, transparency, and predictability that CEOs and U.S. allies and partners crave.



Successful economic security policies also appreciate balance-of-power politics. The United States does not exist in a unipolar world, controlling supply chains and economic chokepoints. The more it acts as if it does, such as through coercive tariffs, the more other countries will balance against it. Frustrations with U.S. tariff policies have already breathed new life into the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, an economic and security body that encompasses more than 40 percent of the world's population and aspires to be a strategic counterweight to the United States' presence in Asia. More balancing may follow suit.

A smarter approach would engage partners. This is not just about doing good; it is strategic. Building trusted supply chains, protecting data, and executing export controls, for instance, all rely on coordination with international partners and, perhaps more important, with industry. Without coordination, rules are weaker, evasion is easier, and law enforcement is harder. True cooperation is not a slipshod, made-for-TV deal. It is accomplished through regular, deliberative bureaucratic conversations and adherence to process. By genuinely seeking input from its partners, the United States can avoid the kind of harmful backlash to its policies that ultimately undermines U.S. influence.

Finally, policymakers must recognize that economic security is a long game. Economic tools such as export promotion to build trusted supply chains tend to take years to work. Yet many national security professionals mistakenly assume that they will see the same immediate results as decisive military action. This rarely happens; it is always easier to destroy than it is to build. Economic policy has the most to offer over the long term, in its potential to transform societies. This is what makes development aid—which the Trump administration has slashed as a supposed cost-saving measure—so valuable. Development, of course, cannot happen overnight. And it is not always clear what problem, or malign actor, the aid is warding off. But helping build a healthier and more prosperous world reduces the chances of many bad outcomes.

The United States' security challenges are becoming only more complex, and policymakers are still figuring out how best to address them using the economic tools at their disposal. Yet one guiding principle is clear: a democratic government does not exist to enrich itself.National security policy, therefore, should not seek profits or involve opportunistic bonus payments. The U.S. government's national security responsibility is to ensure national security. That is it.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon has stepped back from the policy that requires all troops to get the flu shot every year by introducing exemptions for reservists and proclaiming that the shot is only necessary in some circumstances for all service members, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press.

The memo, written by Deputy Defense Secretary Steve Feinberg on May 29 and sent to all the military services, says reserve troops now will need to be on active duty for 30 days or more before being required to get an annual flu shot. It also says the military will no longer be paying for reservists or National Guard members to get the vaccine on their own time.

News of the policy change, which has not been publicly announced by the Pentagon, comes as the Trump administration and its advisers have suggested changes to other vaccination guidance. An influential immunization panel that the administration updated to include anti-vaccine figures decided to not recommend the COVID-19 shot to anyone, while President Donald Trump used his platform to promote unproven and, in some cases, discredited ties between the pain reliever Tylenol, vaccines and autism.

At the Pentagon, the flu shot memo declared that “going forward, the Department will conserve its resources by requiring seasonal flu vaccination for Service members only when doing so most directly contributes to readiness.” However, the document is not clear about the changes because it later says the annual requirement for active-duty troops is still in effect.

While the memo was quietly sent months ago, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth drew attention to it Wednesday when he reposted a comment from an anonymous account that claimed they “won't be forced to get a flu shot this fall for the privilege of serving my state and country in the National Guard.”




Officials in Hegseth's office did not answer questions on the conflicting nature of the memo or comment on the post he amplified.

The Trump administration also has offered back pay to former service members who refused the COVID-19 vaccine and were kicked out of the military under the Biden administration. Those who declined the vaccination have been able to return to service since 2023, but only 113 of the more than 8,000 discharged service members had chosen to do so. 

The back pay offer was intended to encourage more to reenlist but met with limited success. Two months later, Pentagon officials said only 13 people — all Army soldiers — had rejoined the military.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announces the guilty plea of former cartel boss 'El Mayo' and touts the success of the DOJ and law enforcement.

FIRST ON FOX — Eight federal inmates — once on death row for murders, including the killings of fellow prisoners, gang-related stabbings, and the slayings of two campers — have been transferred to a notorious "supermax" prison in Colorado, the Justice Department told Fox News Digital. The news comes as U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi looks to crack down on the previous administration's sweeping clemency actions.

The eight former death row inmates were transferred Tuesday to the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence, Colorado, also known as "ADX," Justice Department officials confirmed. 

They were among the 37 death row inmates whose sentences Biden commuted in late December — prompting criticism and complaints that the record clemency and commutation actions were done as a political "Hail Mary," and without proper vetting.

More of the death row inmates are expected to be moved to ADX, some within weeks, according to one individual familiar with the matter.

The 37 death row inmates commuted by Biden are all expected to be moved to the facility by "early next year," the Justice Department source told Fox News Digital.

The effort comes as Bondi and the Trump administration have sought to reverse some of the Biden administration's efforts on criminal justice reform for certain criminals, and instead moved to prioritize violent crime and cracking down on the nation's worst offenders.

Though a commutation cannot be fully reversed, Justice Department officials told Fox News Digital, Bondi has prioritized ways to penalize these individuals, in coordination with directives from Trump, and to ensure that the "conditions of confinement" are "consistent with the security risks those inmates present because of their egregious crimes, criminal histories, and all other relevant considerations," according to an earlier DOJ memo. 

The eight inmates sent to ADX this week were each convicted of first-degree murder within federal jurisdiction. 

Many had been convicted of crimes that were especially heinous or violent. One individual was convicted of murdering a married couple who was camping at a campsite in the Ouachita National Forest in July 2003. 

Another was convicted of kidnapping, robbing, and murdering a 51-year-old local bank president by tying him to a concrete block and chain hoist, and tossing him off of a bridge and into a lake. 

Many had also killed prisoners while serving time — a factor that can be used in weighing whether to transfer a convicted felon to a higher-security prison.

ADX is the only true federal "supermax" prison in the U.S., and its inmates are as notorious as the prison's reputation. Among them are Ramzi Yousef, convicted in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the Boston Marathon bombers; former Sinola Cartel leader Joaquín Guzmán, or "El Chapo"; and Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, the co-founder of al-Qaeda.

"President Biden's decision to commute the death sentences of these monsters showed abhorrent disregard for our justice system and total disrespect for victims' families already suffering through immense loss," Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

"After meeting with many of the victims' families at the Department of Justice and promising to take action on their behalf, eight of these prisoners have been transferred to the Colorado super-max prison ADX. This will ensure that they spend the remainder of their lives in conditions consistent with the egregious crimes they committed," she added.

Shortly after her confirmation as attorney general, Bondi issued a memo aimed at "restoring a measure of justice" to the victims' families. 

The measures granted by Biden earned more criticism than former President Barack Obama: As Fox News reported at the time, the vast majority of Obama's clemency actions focused on commuting the sentences of federal inmates who met certain criteria outlined under his administration's Clemency Initiative.

Bondi hosted victims' families earlier this year to hear their concerns about the commutations, DOJ said. Some said they had been stunned by the eleventh-hour commutations, and that they not been given a heads-up by the Biden administration.

In February, Bondi issued a memo to the Bureau of Prisons ordering an evaluation of where these prisoners should be detained.

Two weeks after Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk was assassinated, spokesman Andrew Kolvet revealed who had jurisdiction to monitor the rooftop where the alleged killer fired the fatal shot.

Tyler Robinson, 22, is accused of shooting Kirk from the roof of the Losee Center at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10, killing the 31-year-old father of two.

Many questioned why Robinson was not spotted by Kirk's security team, who were feet away from him when he was assassinated.

CHARLIE KIRK'S KILLING AT UTAH UNIVERSITY PROMPTS SCRUTINY OF SECURITY MEASURES

On an episode of "The Charlie Kirk Show" Wednesday afternoon, Kolvet said the Turning Point USA security team does not have the authority to police rooftops or surrounding areas during campus speaking events.

"In defense of our security team, people need to understand that they do not have jurisdiction on the rooftops or the surrounding area," Kolvet said. "Their only jurisdiction on a campus is Charlie's physical proximity, and they were coordinating with local PD and campus PD to make sure all of those venues [were secure]."

Blake Neff, producer of "The Charlie Kirk Show," added Turning Point USA did not have counter snipers or Secret Service to monitor the area outside of Kirk's immediate vicinity.

SCRUTINY INTENSIFIES OVER SECURITY LAPSES SURROUNDING THE CHARLIE KIRK SHOOTING

"Many campus PDs do not have drone programs, which is a big problem," Kolvet said. "I'm actually working on that because it's something they should all have. It should be mandated by some sort of law. … So anyway, just in quick defense of the security, they're only allowed to protect his immediate vicinity. They have to rely on PD to secure the larger perimeter."

Drones have become an increasingly popular resource for police to monitor crowd movements, traffic flow, and potential security threats.

They are cheaper and quicker to deploy than helicopters, and can transmit live video to command centers in real time.

However, law enforcement still must follow Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations, and may need special waivers to fly over large groups of people, or at specific locations.

While Kirk supposedly did not raise any specific security concerns about the Sept. 10 speaking engagement at Utah Valley University, guest speaker Dr. James Orr said in the episode that Kirk acknowledged the "risk" of an upcoming trip to the University of Missouri on Sept. 29.

"We were putting plans in place for me to go with him to the University of Missouri," Orr said. "[Kirk] said, 'You know, that's going to be the tough one. That's where it's riskiest. That's the one that's going to be the most dangerous.' I said, ‘Well, I hope you got a lot of good security.' He said, 'Yeah, it's all sorted. Don't worry about it.'"

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Residents of a San Francisco Bay Area city are on the lookout for an aggressive squirrel that has sent at least two people to the emergency room for medical treatment. 

Joan Heblack told ABC affiliate KGO-TV that she was walking in the Lucas Valley neighborhood of San Rafael when a squirrel seemingly came out of nowhere and attacked her leg, clawing and biting. 

“It clamped onto my leg. The tail was flying up here. I was like, ‘Get it off me, get off me!',” Heblack said. 

Isabel Campoy also said she was attacked while walking in the same area. The squirrel launched itself from the ground to her face and wound up on her arm, leaving it bloody, she said. 

Both women went to the emergency room, the TV station reported in its Monday story. 

Flyers have now been posted, warning residents that the squirrel is no joke and that more than five people have been attacked by a ”very mean squirrel” that “comes out of nowhere.”

Lisa Bloch with Marin Humane says they have had no reports of squirrel attacks since mid-September. If the squirrel crops up again, the nonprofit will coordinate with the state to remove the animal, she said. 

“We've seen this kind of behavior before,” she said. “It's almost always because someone has been feeding the animal.” 

The good thing is that squirrels are not vectors for rabies. She says people should never feed wildlife. 

San Rafael is in Marin County, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of San Francisco .

            Taylor Budowich, President Donald Trump's deputy chief of staff overseeing communications, will leave the administration later this month for a new job, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            His imminent exit makes him the highest-profile staffer to leave the White House in Trump's second term, which is now at its eight-month mark. It's not uncommon for White House staffers to cycle out after about a year. The relative stability of this administration's staff is a departure from Trump's first term, which was characterized by frequent turnover.
    


            Budowich, who declined to comment on Wednesday, served as Trump's spokesperson after he left office in 2021 and later ran the Trump-aligned super PAC MAGA Inc., before rejoining the 2024 campaign.
    


            Axios first reported his departure.
    


            Up until now, the highest-profile aide to depart had been Mike Waltz. But while he was ousted as national security adviser in May, he's since been confirmed as Trump's ambassador to the United Nations.

Families announced legal action against American Airlines and the U.S. government over the Jan. 29 American Eagle Flight 5342 crash near Washington, D.C. (Credit: Pool)

The family of Casey Crafton has filed the first lawsuit over the American Eagle Flight 5342 crash in the Potomac River near Washington, D.C., alleging the disaster was avoidable and caused by systemic negligence.

The Jan. 29 crash involved an Army Black Hawk helicopter that collided midair with an American Airlines passenger plane near Ronald Reagan Washington International Airport, killing 64 people on the American Eagle flight and three aboard the military helicopter.

The federal lawsuit was filed on behalf of Casey Crafton's estate, with his wife Rachel and family leading the legal action.

"Our lives were shattered in a moment," said Dailey Crafton, Crafton's brother. "Casey was betrayed by systemic disregard for safety. We cannot stand by and allow his life to be lost in vain."

Multiple victims' family members spoke at a news conference Wednesday, accusing the US government and American Airlines of negligence. (POOL)

The lawsuit accuses American Airlines and PSA Airlines of negligence in operations, training, and knowingly allowing dangerous conditions at DCA, noting the crash was predictable and preventable.

American Airlines allegedly ignored repeated near misses and congestion data, prioritizing profit over safety, according to attorneys.

"The crash of American Eagle 5342 was predictable, preventable, and caused the needless loss of 67 lives," said attorney Robert Clifford. "… American ran red lights for years by allowing these planes to operate in congested, unsafe conditions."

Action will also be brought against the U.S. government, encompassing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the U.S. Army, for systemic failures in oversight, air traffic control and military helicopter procedures.

Attorneys said the FAA failed to provide safe air traffic control and allowed unsafe operational environments, while the Army helicopter crew failed to follow basic "see and avoid" flight principles.

"The helicopter crew's conduct was inexcusable," said Brian Alexander, an attorney and former Army aviator. "Air traffic control completely failed in their duty as the lifeguards of our aviation system."

Before suing the government, families must first file separate Form 95 claims, which attorneys said have already been filed by nearly all the victims' families.

The Crafton case is expected to serve as a guiding complaint for other victims' families, which are expected to be consolidated in federal court.

Doug Lane, who lost his wife, Christine, and son, Spencer, in the crash, said more than 120 family members have banded together to "become something both beautiful and powerful."

"We support each other through birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, weddings—that were planned but never held," Lane said. "Little League and figure skating seasons that started with missing coaches, missing competitors, and missing parents in the stands."

He said the group has also "turned our grief into action."

"We've collaborated with Congress on critical air safety reforms. We've secured a much-needed set of oversight investigations into the FAA, and we will not rest until similar investigations are underway into the US Army," Lane said. "We'll bring that same level of passion and relentlessness as we seek accountability and change through the legal process.

"Many of us have been asked whether we dread the idea of rehashing the worst days of our lives in court. Our answer today is clear: We're ready. … We are here to see this process through, however long it takes, to ensure that our family members have a lasting legacy that makes the world safer for everyone who flies."

The lawsuit is seeking both monetary damages and congressional air safety reforms.

            • The victims: One detainee is dead and two more are in critical condition following a shooting at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Dallas, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
    


            • “Targeted violence”: The FBI is investigating it “as an act of targeted violence.” The shooter — identified by sources as Joshua Jahn — died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he “fired indiscriminately” at the ICE building from a nearby rooftop, according to the DHS.
    


• Message on casing: FBI Director Kash Patel posted an image of bullet casings on social media found near the suspected shooter, showing one with the words “ANTI-ICE” written on it.



            Aerial video captured by CNN affiliate KTVT shows officers searching a building where authorities say a gunman fired at the nearby ICE facility in Dallas and shot three ICE detainees.
    


            Several law enforcement officers can be seen on the roof of the building while others enter.
    


            The video later pans to shows an aerial view of the ICE facility.
    


            The shooter fired “indiscriminately” at the ICE facility from the other building's rooftop Wednesday morning, “including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot,” the Department of Homeland Security has said. Of the three ICE detainees shot, two were killed, and a third was hospitalized, authorities have said.
    


            Vice President JD Vance responded sharply to the deadly shooting at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas on Wednesday, calling it an act of politically motivated violence and directly blaming what he described as inflammatory rhetoric from Democratic leaders and the media.
    


                    “We're still learning a little bit about it,” Vance said during remarks in Concord, North Carolina, “but what we know is that in Dallas, Texas, an ICE facility was opened fire upon by a violent left-wing extremist a person who wrote anti-ICE messaging on their bullets.”
                





            The vice president claimed that the attack was politically driven, saying: “And there's some evidence that we have that's not yet public, but we know this person was politically motivated.”
    


            The FBI has said it is investigating the shooting “as an act of targeted violence.” The suspected shooter is Joshua Jahn, according to three sources familiar with the case. Authorities said the shooter was found dead at the scene.
    


            FBI Director Kash Patel posted an image of rounds recovered on X, with one of the five casings in the photo bearing the words “ANTI-ICE” written in blue ink.
    


            Vance went on to accuse figures like California Gov. Gavin Newsom and left-leaning media outlets of vilifying law enforcement and creating an environment that fuels violence.
    


            “When the left-wing media lies about what [ICE is] doing,” he said, “what they're doing is encouraging crazy people to go and commit violence.”
    


            “You don't have to agree with Donald Trump's immigration policies. But if your political rhetoric encourages violence against our law enforcement, you can go straight to hell.”
    


            Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons described today's shooting as “a tragic incident” that “unfolded so quickly.”
    


            Lyons told Fox News this afternoon that the shooter fired into an open waiting area known as the sallyport, where agents brought in detainees. He said the ICE facility was “a definite target,” adding that windows, doors and vehicles were also fired at.
    


            “It wasn't directed at the detainees. It wasn't directed at civilians on the street. It was a definite attack on law enforcement. He was there to attack that building,” Lyons told Fox.
    


            He said everyone is “shook up” by the incident and called for an end to violence against ICE.
    


            Regarding next steps after the Dallas shooting, Lyons told Fox securing the facility and ensuring safety is the agency's top priority.
    


            “What we got to do first and foremost is protect the men and women of ICE, harden up our facilities, make sure we're safe,” he said. “Then we really got to target these people that are anti-ICE rhetoric or causing threats and really take a deep dive and see what happened with this gentleman right here.”
    


            Joshua Jahn, the suspect who authorities believe gunned down two detainees and injured a third at a Dallas ICE facility, was previously charged a decade ago with delivering marijuana, court records show.
    


            Jahn, 29, had lived in a Dallas suburb, according to public records. Three sources told CNN that he is the shooter, and authorities have said the gunman killed himself after opening fire.
    


            In 2016, when he was 19 years old, Jahn was charged with delivering more than one-fourth ounce of marijuana. He pleaded guilty and the case again him was deferred, with Jahn being placed on probation, according to Collin County court records. The charge is classified in Texas law as a “state jail felony,” the least severe type of felony in the state.
    


            Jahn voted in the Democratic primary in March 2020 and hasn't voted since then, according to records provided to CNN by the Collin County Elections Department. Voters in Texas don't declare a political party when registering to vote, but choose a party's ballot when voting in primaries.
    


            Dallas Mayor Eric L. Johnson called for healing and unity after a shooting at an ICE facility left two people dead Wednesday.
    


            “We are better than this craven act of violence,” the mayor said in a statement. “In moments like this, our city must stand together and support one another. We must heal.”
    


            He said violence like Wednesday's shooting should never happen and that it affected an entire community, not just law enforcement and the victims.
    


            “It is an attack on our community and on our nation's heritage of civil and democratic discourse,“ Johnson said. “We should all condemn violence intended to serve a political agenda and work together to end it.”
    


            A gunman targeted an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Dallas, Texas, this morning, leaving one detainee dead and two others hospitalized in critical condition.
    


            Authorities have said the gunman killed himself after opening fire.
    


The FBI is investigating the shooting as “an act of targeted violence,” according to Special Agent in Charge Joe Rothrock. None of the people shot were members of law enforcement, he said.
    


Here's more on what we know, so far, about today's shooting:



The gunman: Three sources familiar with the case identified the shooter as 29-year-old  Joshua Jahn. Jahn lived in a Dallas suburb, according to public records. Jahn voted in the Democratic primary in March 2020 and hasn't voted since, according to records provided to CNN by the Collin County Elections Department. The Department of Homeland Security described Jahn as a “sniper” who opened fire “indiscriminately” on the Dallas ICE facility.
    


The victims: The three detainees who were shot were in the country illegally, had been arrested and were awaiting transfer to a longer-term facility, ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan told Fox News. In a corrected statement, DHS said “one detainee is deceased, and two others are in critical condition.”
    


The shooting: Dallas police received an “assist the officer call” at around 6:40 a.m. local time, Chief Daniel Comeaux said during a news conference today. Sheahan said the gunman fired “indiscriminately” and authorities “found bullets throughout the entire building that had punctured into the facility.” The shooter fired into the ICE facility from the rooftop of another building, authorities have said.
    


Bullet casings: FBI Director Kash Patel and DHS said bullet casings with “anti-ICE messages” were found. DHS said in a statement, “This was an attack on ICE law enforcement.”
    


CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, Leigh Waldman, Chris Boyette, Alisha Ebrahimji, Casey Tolan, Curt Devine and Maureen Chowdhury contributed to this report. 



            The shooter believed to be responsible for killing two detainees and injuring a third at a Dallas ICE facility is Joshua Jahn, according to three sources familiar with the case.
    


            Jahn is 29 years old, one source briefed on the investigation told CNN.
    


            Authorities have said the shooter was found dead at the scene.
    


            Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons confirmed the suspect's identity in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday afternoon, saying of Joshua Jahn, “he was known to law enforcement.”
    


            Lyons said investigators are “going to get with all his contacts, scrub his social media, maybe go to his parents' home or where he was living. But they want to drill down and figure out what made him anti-ICE, what made him want to do that, and see if there's any co-conspirators, see if the facility is still safe, see if anything else is still planned.”
    


            The three detainees shot at the ICE facility in Dallas Wednesday – two of whom were killed – had been arrested and were to be transferred to a longer-term facility, ICE deputy director Madison Sheahan told Fox News.
    


            The shooter fired “indiscriminately” at the ICE facility from a rooftop of another building, “including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot,” the Department of Homeland Security has said.
    


            The three detainees were in the country illegally and “being processed at this facility and would have been moved to a long-term detention facility,” Sheahan told Fox News.
    


            Two detainees were killed, and one is in serious condition after the shooting, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN.
    


            “We are working with our local officers to identify next of kin and make sure those notifications are made. Until that time, I don't want to jump ahead on any families dealing with this tragedy,” she said.
    


            The person who shot into the Dallas ICE facility fired “indiscriminately,” according to ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan.
    


            “What we do know so far is that the shooter was firing indiscriminately throughout the whole building,” Sheahan told Fox News on Wednesday. “The shooter was at a building nearby, shooting directly into the building, going across the entire length of the building.”
    


            The deputy director added that it was a potentially “very dangerous situation” for law enforcement. No law enforcement personnel were injured, according to Joe Rothrock, special agent in charge of the FBI's Dallas field office.
    


            “We found bullets throughout the entire building that had punctured into the facility, targeting the entire ICE facility,” Sheahan said.
    


            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said the shooting at the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Dallas today will not deter officials from carrying out immigration actions.
    


            “We will not let this cowardly attack impede our efforts to secure the border, enforce immigration law, and ensure law and order,” Abbott said in a statement.
    


            He said agencies like ICE, in coordination with the state's Department of Public Safety and the National Guard, will continue to “arrest, detain, and deport any individuals in this country illegally — without interruption.”
    


            Calling the shooting “horrific,” the governor said “the ongoing onslaught of violent and subversive rhetoric from the Left” should be denounced.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security has issued a new statement on the shooting at the Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility.
    


            Bullet casings with “anti-ICE messages” were found on scene where a “sniper” opened fire and shot three detainees, according to DHS.
    


            “This morning, a sniper opened fire from a nearby rooftop on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Dallas field office. The shooter fired indiscriminately at the ICE building, including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot,” it said.
    


            “Three detainees were shot. Two are deceased, and the other is in critical condition. The gunman was found with a self-inflicted gun wound,” according to the statement.
    


            The DHS statement also noted that “shell casings were found with anti-ICE messages on them. This was an attack on ICE law enforcement.”
    


            FBI Director Kash Patel posted about the casings on X earlier. Of the five casings shown in the photo Patel posted, one has the words “ANTI-ICE” written in blue ink.
    


            Following a news conference outside the Dallas ICE facility where the head of the FBI field office said rounds were found near the suspected shooter containing “messages that are anti-ICE in nature,” FBI Director Kash Patel posted an image of rounds on X.
    


            The FBI didn't provide any details during the briefing about what was written on the ammunition until shortly after the news conference.
    


            Of the five casings shown in the photo Patel posted on X, one has the words “ANTI-ICE” written in blue ink.
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is blaming “far-left” rhetoric about US Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the deadly shooting at a field office in Dallas this morning.
    


                    “For months, we've been warning politicians and the media to tone down their rhetoric about ICE law enforcement before someone was killed,” Noem said in a post on X. “These horrendous killings must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences.”
                





            So far, officials have given little information about a possible motive.
    


            Noem said ICE agents “get up every morning to try and make our communities safer,” and they should not be dehumanized.
    


            Two detainees were killed and one is in serious condition after the shooting, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN. During an earlier news conference, officials said no law enforcement agents were injured or shot.
    


            Two detainees were killed, and one is in serious condition after a shooting at a Dallas ICE facility Wednesday morning, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN.
    


            During an earlier press conference, authorities didn't provide details on the fatalities but noted that no law enforcement agents were injured or shot.
    


            In a post on X, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem condemned heightened rhetoric against ICE, saying: “These horrendous killings must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences.”
    


            Ruth Harper, an immigration attorney based in Dallas, Texas, reported to the Dallas ICE facility on Wednesday morning for a routine check in for her client, she told CNN Wednesday.
    


            When she arrived, police had blocked off access to the facility and told her there was an active shooter. She said her initial reaction was “terrified” for her clients.
    


“Usually, they are only there a short time before they are moved to a detention center,” she said. 






            One of her clients is at the facility; another, who was expected to report for the check in today, was not on site.
    


            Dallas police said one person is dead and two people are hospitalized with injuries after a shooting this morning at the ICE field office in Dallas.
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem earlier said the suspect died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
    


             Multiple law enforcement officials told CNN the person killed was a detainee.
    


            “Today, at approximately 6:40 a.m. (local time), we received a(n) assist the officer call. We responded to the call, got to the scene, and we later learned that we had four individuals that were shot, two of them deceased, including the shooter,” Chief Daniel Comeaux said at the news conference. “DPD quickly was able to locate the shooter who was deceased.”
    


            GOP Sen. Ted Cruz urged politicians to stop using rhetoric that is “demonizing” Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Patrol agents.
    


            “This needs to stop. Violence is wrong. Politically motivated violence is wrong,” Cruz said during a news conference in Dallas following the ICE facility shooting.
    


            Cruz said that this morning's incident is “the third shooting in Texas directed at ICE or CBP. This must stop. To every politician who is using rhetoric demonizing ICE and demonizing CPB, stop.”
    


            He continued: “To every politician demanding that ICE agents be doxxed and calling for people to go after their families, stop. This has very real consequences.”
    


                    Cruz went on to say that he hopes that “every one of us will pray, number one for the law enforcement that are risking their lives to keep us safe; number two, for the health of those who were shot and injured today. We still don't know the full details of who was injured, but for the families of the victims of this shooting.”
                





            He added that a debate about immigration policies can happen in the halls of Congress “without demonizing each other.”
    


            The deadly shooting at an ICE facility near downtown Dallas is believed to be a targeted incident, according to the head of the FBI field office in Dallas.
    


            “I can confirm at this time that the FBI is investigating this incident as an act of targeted violence,” said Special Agent in Charge Joe Rothrock.
    


                    “Early evidence that we've seen from rounds that were found near the suspected shooter contain messages that are anti-ICE in nature,” Rothrock added.
                





            The FBI did not provide further details on what was written on the ammunition.
    


            None of the people shot in this morning's shooting at a Dallas ICE facility were members of law enforcement, FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Joe Rothrock said, though officials are not yet confirming the identities of the victims.
    


                    “This will be an ongoing investigation between us, a number of federal partners and our local partners, again, to ensure that anyone responsible is held accountable,” Rothrock said.
                





            Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson asked people to “be patient” and “remain calm” as law enforcement conduct the investigation into Wednesday morning's shooting at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas.
    


                    “This is an active investigation,” he said. “There's still a lot of unanswered questions, and I want to encourage all of you to exercise a little bit of restraint and allow them to do their job, to help make sure this continues to be a safe city, and that they can help us figure out what happened here today.”

Fox News' Eric Shawn reports the latest on the growing support for accused killer Luigi Mangione. New York Post contributor Douglas Murray also weighs in on the trend and the impact of social media on young boys during 'America's Newsroom.'

Luigi Mangione's defense lawyers are crying foul to a judge about the Trump administration and Department of Justice over references to the accused assassin as left-wing and "anti-fascist."

And they are accusing top government officials of violating Mangione's Fifth and Eighth Amendment rights to a fair trial by continuing to make statements about the case outside the courtroom.

They took issue with a range of incidents, including a Fox News interview in which President Donald Trump alleged, "He shot someone in the back as clear as you're looking at me."

In another, Mangione's lawyers wrote that "the White House Press Secretary referred to Mr. Mangione as a 'left-wing assassin,'" and that a different White House official called their client a "self-described so-called anti-fascist."

TRUMP DEFENDS LABELING ANTIFA A 'TERRORIST ORGANIZATION' AS HE TARGETS LEFT-WING EXTREMISM

"The Government has indelibly prejudiced Mr. Mangione by baselessly linking him to unrelated violent events and left-wing extremist groups, despite there being no connection or affiliation," wrote Karen Friedman Agnifilo, one of Mangione's top-tier defense lawyers. "A recent, tragic, high-profile murder has only increased this prejudicial rhetoric."

She was likely referencing the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, who was shot and killed while speaking at Utah Valley University Sept. 10. The suspect in that attack, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, is accused of engraving his bullet casings with memes and Antifa-inspired language.

Read the letter to the judge:

On Wednesday morning, another gunman opened fire at the Dallas field office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, killing two people and injuring a third before fatally shooting himself.

Authorities recovered bullets at the Dallas scene with the phrase "Anti-ICE" written on an unspent round.

MANGIONE DEFENSE CLAIMS HIS 'BEAUTIFUL, PROMISING LIFE DERAILED' IN UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO MURDER CASE

FBI Director Kash Patel said investigators recovered these rounds from the scene in Dallas where a gunman opened fire on the local ICE field office.  (FBI)

Mangione allegedly wrote the words "deny," "delay" and "depose" on spent and unspent casings police recovered while investigating his case in what appears to be a reference to the title of a book that is critical of the U.S. health insurance industry.

The defense is accusing the DOJ of violating the rules of criminal court that balance the First Amendment with the right to a fair trial.

After receiving the defense letter, Judge Margaret Garnett gave the DOJ until Oct. 3 to respond with a sworn declaration "from a person of suitable authority" in the Southern District of New York to explain the incidents, which appear to have violated a prior court order from April in which the judge told prosecutors to abide by Local Criminal Rule 23.1 (a), which governs the balance between freedom of speech and a defendant's right to a fair trial.

The defense also claimed that the government, due to its possession of Mangione's journals, is aware that his writings don't mention Antifa ties.

"The Government very well knows this statement to be false as they are in possession of his alleged extensive journal writings where the writer never once mentions being anti- (or pro) fascist," the defense wrote.

Mangione allegedly wrote critically about the health insurance industry and wanting to "whack" a CEO, authorities have said. He is also accused of wanting "to incite national debates."

"The DOJ may have fanned the flames by portraying Luigi Mangione as a left-wing assassin," said Randolph Rice, an attorney and legal analyst based in the 27-year-old former Ivy Leaguer's home state of Maryland. "His lawyers have pushed back hard, noting there's nothing in his past or his writings to support that narrative."

The legal dogma is that prosecutors usually avoid extrajudicial statements so that they don't risk tainting the potential jury pool, Rice told Fox News Digital. But Mangione's case may have an extra level of danger if it continues to inspire shooters.

"The danger is that extremists may now view him as an inspiration, taking cues from his actions, like writing messages on bullets, to fuel their own twisted beliefs and commit violence for political purposes," Rice said.

The assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on Dec. 4, 2024, appears to have inspired, at least partially, the subsequent attacks in Orem, Utah, and Dallas, Texas.

Thompson, like Kirk, was a married father of two.

"Writing messages on bullets is significant because it reveals the shooter's intent even before a single round is fired," Rice said. "For prosecutors, that kind of evidence is gold. It can demonstrate motive, premeditation and, in some cases, support additional charges, including hate crimes if the messaging targets a specific group."

While the messages themselves may be evidence that prosecutors can use against shooters in court, Rice warned that copycats may increasingly be using murder to justify their political views.

"What we're seeing in Dallas and in other recent cases is a disturbing trend — radicalized individuals who aren't just committing violence but trying to make a political or ideological statement through the very ammunition they use," Rice told Fox News Digital. "That's not random. It's deliberate."

Just about two weeks before Kirk's murder in Utah, a gunman who identified as transgender opened fire on schoolchildren at a Catholic church in Minneapolis. That attacker wrote messages on his guns and magazines in an apparent reference to two other mass shooters who opened fire at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, and at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is once again sparking campaign buzz for participating in an advertisement advocating California redistricting. 

"Trump is redrawing maps to force a Congress that only answers to him — not the people," Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., said while posting a viral video of Ocasio-Cortez on X. "@AOC knows California can stop him with Prop 50."

California voters will decide during November's special election whether to temporarily redraw new congressional district maps in response to President Donald Trump successfully urging Gov. Greg Abbott and Texas Republicans to secure five additional Republican-leaning districts through their own redistricting process. 

"Prop 50 levels the playing field and gives power back to the people," the New York Democrat said in the ad, urging Californians to "fight for democracy in all 50 states" by voting "yes on 50."

If passed, Prop 50 would allow California's Democratic supermajority to redraw its congressional districts to secure five more Democrat-leaning congressional districts, leveling the playing field against Texas redistricting. More states, including Missouri and Ohio, have their own redistricting plans ahead of competitive midterm elections expected in 2026. 

"California, you know we don't back down from a fight," the New York Democrat said in the ad. "And this November, the fight belongs to you."

NEWSOM UNVEILING CALIFORNIA REDISTRICTING EFFORT TO COUNTER TRUMP-BACKED PUSH IN TEXAS

The video has been viewed by more than 2 million people in the 24 hours since Newsom posted it. 

"Seven years in, some politicians are *finally* understanding why bringing @AOC into our fight is a good thing!" Democratic strategist Rebecca Katz responded on X.

The Bronx representative also appears in a Spanish version of the ad, which was paid for by Yes on 50. 

"Donald Trump is redrawing election maps to force through a Congress that only answers to him, not the people. If he gets away with it, all bets are off for our healthcare, our paychecks and our freedoms. With Prop 50, we can stop him," she said, looking directly into the camera.

The California Republican Party criticized Newsom for "relying on a New Yorker" to "tell Californians how to vote."

"It's part of their disturbing pattern: silence the debate, control the outcome, and erase the people who think differently. Don't let them rig the system. Vote NO on Prop 50!" California Republicans said on X. 

Meanwhile, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is trying to terminate California Democrats' redistricting fight.

The ad was released on the heels of an Axios' report saying Ocasio-Cortez's team is positioning her for a 2028 presidential or U.S. Senate run. 

Former Vice President Kamala Harris made apparent jabs at her potential 2028 presidential opponents in her new book, "107 Days," which was released Tuesday. "Hiking. Will call back. (He never did.)" was Newsom's response when Harris reached out after President Joe Biden suspended his re-election campaign, according to the book.

But Harris only had positive words for Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. 

"AOC goes deep into policy but has a lightness with people, a joyful warrior vibe," Harris said in the book. "Her talent for deconstructing complex issues and her commitment to getting justice for working people make her an invaluable leader in this moment."

Ocasio-Cortez sparked plenty of campaign buzz earlier this year when she joined Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on his widely popular "Fighting Oligarchy" tour. 

In April, Ocasio-Cortez's campaign account posted a video on X that invigorated rumors she could be mulling a presidential run as the four-term Democrat from New York City and the progressive leader proclaimed, "We are one."

When asked later that month if she was harboring any presidential ambitions, the young Democrat did not rule out 2028 presidential aspirations to Fox News Digital. 

The momentum around Ocasio-Cortez comes as Democrats are searching for new party leadership following consequential losses up and down the ballot in 2024.

Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders have both endorsed and supported New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's campaign despite establishment Democrats' reluctance to embrace the self-identified Democratic socialist's platform. 

Newsom and Ocasio-Cortez did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Deputy I.C.E. Director Madison Sheahan shares the latest information on the deadly shooting at a Dallas facility on 'America Reports.'

Vice President JD Vance said that those who denigrate law enforcement are encouraging "crazy people to go and commit violence," after a shooter opened fire at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility Wednesday in Dallas. 

"You don't have to agree with my immigration policies. You don't have to agree with Donald Trump's immigration policies. But if your political rhetoric encourages violence against our law enforcement, you can go straight to hell," Vance said Wednesday during a trip to North Carolina. "And you have no place in the political conversation of the United States of America."

"If you want to stop political violence, stop attacking our law enforcement as the Gestapo," Vance said. "If you want to stop political violence, stop telling your supporters that everybody who disagrees with you is a Nazi. If you want to stop political violence, look in the mirror. That's the way that we stop political violence in this country." 

The FBI claimed it is investigating the matter as a "targeted attack" against ICE, and the Department of Homeland Security said it had identified shell casings with "anti-ICE" messages.

Three detainees were shot. Two have subsequently died while one is in critical condition, according to a statement from DHS. 

No ICE officers were harmed in the shooting and authorities said the shooter died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. 

"Look, just because we don't support illegal aliens, we don't want them to be executed by violent assassins engaged in political violence either," Vance said. "So we're praying both for our ICE agents, but also for everybody who's affected by this terrible attack."

There have been multiple shootings at ICE facilities in 2025, and DHS reported in July that assaults against ICE officers and other federal immigration agents have risen nearly 700% compared to 2024. While the agency reported 10 assault incidents between Jan. 1, 2024, and June 30, 2024, that number rose to 79 reported assaults in the same time frame in 2025. 

Other recent episodes of violence against law enforcement include another shooting near ICE's Prairieland, Texas, Detention Facility in July, where a police officer was shot in the neck.

The White House previously has called on Democrats to de-escalate language toward ICE amid opposition to the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda. 

For example, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., accused ICE of acting "like a terrorist force" in June, and later defended her comments in a CNN interview after the White House demanded an apology from the lawmaker.

JERUSALEM (AP) — A drone launched by Yemen's Houthi rebels wounded 22 people in the southern Israeli city of Eilat on Wednesday, according to medics. It was a rare breach of Israel's sophisticated missile defenses, which have greatly limited casualties from such attacks. 

In the Gaza Strip, at least 41 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire, according to local hospitals. U.S. President Donald Trump's Mideast envoy expressed optimism over a new plan for ending the war, without saying what it entails or if Israel or Hamas have accepted it.

Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have regularly fired drones and missiles at Israel — and attacked international shipping — in what they say is support for the Palestinians. The vast majority of the drones and missiles fired at Israel have been shot down or fallen in open areas without wounding anyone. 

The Houthis said in a statement that they had fired two drones at Israel. Israel has carried out retaliatory airstrikes on Yemen after past attacks, and Defense Minister Israel Katz, in a post on X, warned the Houthis that “anyone who harms Israel will be harmed sevenfold.”

The Israeli military said it had tried to intercept the drone. The Magen David Adom rescue service said the wounded were taken to a nearby hospital, two of them with “severe shrapnel injuries to their limbs.”

In Gaza, at least 22 people were killed when an Israeli strike hit tents sheltering displaced people in Gaza City, according to Dr. Fadel Naim, director of the Al-Ahli hospital, which received the casualties. Three children and nine women were among those killed, he told The Associated Press.

The Israeli military said it targeted two Hamas militants, using precise munitions and taking other measures to avoid harming civilians. Israel blames Hamas for civilian deaths because the militants are embedded in densely populated areas.

Another Israeli strike hit a group of Palestinians in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing at least 12 of them, according to the Al-Awda Hospital. Another 18 people were wounded, it said. Four people — two children and their parents — were killed in a strike on their home in Nuseirat, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah.

There was no immediate comment from the military on those strikes.

Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza said that it received the bodies of three people killed by gunfire while seeking aid. Health officials in Gaza and the U.N. human rights office say hundreds of people have been killed by Israeli fire while seeking humanitarian aid in recent months. 

The military has said it only fires warning shots when people approach its forces in what it considers a threatening manner.

In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, a 24-year-old Palestinian was shot and killed by Israeli forces near the northern city of Jenin, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The military said soldiers shot and killed a man after he hurled an explosive device at them.

The latest violence came as the Mideast crisis was front and center at the U.N. General Assembly.

At separate events, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's lead negotiator Steve Witkoff both offered optimistic views about what Witkoff called a “Trump 21-point plan for peace” that was presented to Arab leaders on Tuesday.

“We had a very productive session,” Witkoff said at a conference in New York. “I think it addresses Israeli concerns, as well as the concerns of all the neighbors in the region. And we're hopeful, and I might say even confident, that in the coming days, we'll be able to announce some sort of breakthrough.”

Speaking to senior officials from the Gulf Cooperation Council, Rubio said “some very important work is ongoing even as we speak, and we're hoping to achieve this as soon as possible.”

Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, in a post on X, said the latest proposals are “an important foundation upon which we can build further in the coming period to achieve peace.”

The U.S., along with Egypt and Qatar, have spent months trying to broker a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release. Those efforts suffered a major setback earlier this month when Israel carried out an airstrike targeting Hamas leaders in Qatar.

The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. Forty-eight captives are still inside Gaza, around 20 of them believed by Israel to be alive, after most of the rest were freed in ceasefires or other deals.

Israel's ongoing retaliatory offensive has killed more than 65,000 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It doesn't say how many were civilians or combatants, but says women and children make up around half the fatalities. The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government. U.N. agencies and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties.

Israel launched another major ground operation earlier this month in Gaza City, which experts say is experiencing famine. More than 300,000 people have fled, but up to 700,000 are still there, many because they can't afford to relocate.

            A top Justice Department official has retracted a letter he sent to an FBI agent who responded to the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre that suggested the agent was being investigated in relation to a defamation lawsuit against Alex Jones.
    


            In a letter to William Aldenberg's attorney last week, President Donald Trump ally Ed Martin implied the agent was being scrutinized because of his role in a major lawsuit led by families of victims that resulted in a $1.4 billion judgment against the conspiracy theorist Jones.
    


            Aldenberg, who was one of the first responders the day of the 2012 elementary school massacre, was a plaintiff in the lawsuit. He and the families testified that they faced years of harassment and threats from those who believed Jones' lies that the shooting, which killed 20 first graders and six adults, was a hoax.
    


            Martin initially told Aldenberg's attorney that he had questions about the agent benefiting financially from the lawsuit and ominously warned that “there are criminal laws protecting the citizens from actions by government employees who may be acting for personal benefit.”
    


            “I encourage you to review those,” Martin wrote, according to a copy of the letter Jones posted on X.



            But in a new letter addressed to attorney Christopher Mattei on Wednesday, Martin withdrew his initial letter entirely.
    


            In a brief note, CNN first reported, Martin wrote that there is no investigation of Aldenberg and “because of this, I hereby withdraw my request for information from you or your former client.”
    


            Martin was ordered by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to retract the letter, according to a person familiar with the matter.
    


            Mattei said he is pleased “this so-called inquiry” has ended.
    


            “Less than 18 hours after calling out Alex Jones and Ed Martin for their corrupt use of the Department of Justice to harass Sandy Hook families and the heroic FBI agent who ran into that school to save any children he could, I am happy to learn that this so-called inquiry has now been withdrawn, if it ever existed at all,” Mattei said in a statement. “Let this be a reminder: this is not a moment to cower in silence, but to stand up to bullying, lawless misconduct. This isn't over.”
    


            After Trump took office, Martin was initially set to be the top US attorney in Washington, but after failing to secure confirmation because the Senate torpedoed his nomination, he was instead given multiple roles inside the Justice Department. He now serves as the director of the department's “Weaponization Working Group.”
    


            The original September 15 letter from Martin, disclosed by Jones on social media, was met with derision from the families and the FBI agent.
    


            “Thanks to the courage of the Sandy Hook families, Infowars will soon be finished,” Mattei, the attorney for Aldenberg and the families, said in a statement responding to the original letter. “In his last gasps, Jones is once again harassing them, only now with the corrupt complicity of at least one DOJ official. It's as disgusting as it is pathetic, and we will not stand for it.”
    


            Jones posted the original letter on X. The letter does not make any specific allegation or charge behind the investigation.
    


            Martin has not respond to CNN's requests for comment.
    


            “I am writing to request information from you regarding your client FBI Special Agent William Aldenberg and his role in certain litigation that may benefit him personally and that may impact our citizens and our legal system,” the letter to Aldenberg's attorney says. “As you may know, there are criminal laws protecting the citizens from actions by government employees who may be acting for personal benefit. I encourage you to review those.”
    


            Since he joined the Justice Department early in Trump's second turn, Martin has sent several similar letters threatening legal action against the president's perceived enemies or organizations that run counter to his agenda – many of which have been leaked to the public.
    


            In his letter to Mattei, Martin requested he “keep this correspondence confidential” because “I do not wish to litigate this in the media.”
    


            Nevertheless, Jones posted the letter on X, claiming that “The DOJ's Task Force On Government Weaponization Against The American People Has Launched An Investigation Into The Democrat Party / FBI Directing Illegal Law-fare Against Alex Jones And Infowars.”
    


            And earlier this month before the letter was sent, Jones posted a picture of Martin and himself on social media with the caption, “I just had a very important meeting with DOJ strikeforce leader, Ed Martin.”
    


            And this week, Jones on his online show said, “a bunch of other actions are being taken right now. They are gonna be breaking very soon.”

﻿A conservative explains what Kirk meant to the MAGA movement — and how it's reacting to his death.

It is impossible, I think, to grasp the terrible consequences of Charlie Kirk's death without understanding who he was in life.

Liberals had a dim view of that track record — focusing on his often-offensive radio broadcasts and contributions to Trump's authoritarian project (like sending seven buses to the January 6 protest). However, to conservatives, he was something very different: not just an effective political organizer but a living symbol of democratic politics done the right way.

I must admit that this second perspective doesn't come naturally to me. But I wanted to understand it better, so I reached out to Tanner Greer — a conservative author and essayist who had written brilliantly about what Kirk meant to the right on his blog The Scholar's Stage.

In his piece, Greer argues that Kirk was “the indispensable man” on the populist right: Nobody else had his genius for organization or his extensive connections with nearly everyone of note in the MAGA movement. On an ideological level, per Greer, Kirk represented a vision of politics in which the populist right competes on the left's turf, from universities to elections, and wins in direct political combat. In this, he stood against MAGA's most radical anti-democratic voices.

The ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.

So when he was killed, Greer explains, his many friends and allies saw it as proof that the broader left was now incapable of coexisting with even someone as genial and small-d democratic as Kirk — giving rise to the vehement, even authoritarian, response of people like Stephen Miller and JD Vance. Now, much of the right believes it's their turn to seize control of culture, to have a version of the left's “George Floyd moment” of 2020.

I didn't agree with much of the thinking Greer described. But I found his explanation of it, to borrow a phrase, “indispensable.”

He helped me understand why leading Republicans blame an ill-defined “they” for Kirk's killing, rather than a shooter who seemingly acted alone, and just how emotional these conservatives must be in the wake of Kirk's passing. If we are to keep sharing a country, you need to understand this perspective — perhaps especially if you disagree with it.

What follows is a transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.

Tell me what you think most people who only knew Kirk from his radio broadcasts missed about him.

Second only to Donald Trump himself, Kirk is probably the most important individual in creating the current intellectual and organizational landscape of the MAGA movement. You wouldn't get any of this at all if all you knew of him was some guy who's willing to say shocking things on the internet.

In the piece, I suggest there's [several] aspects of Charlie Kirk that made him a very powerful individual.

First, the size of his audience. His radio show had about 500,000 people who listened to it. His TikTok channel had 7 million followers. He's had campus debates that had upwards of 2 billion views in total all across the world. 5 million Twitter followers on top of that. So he had this giant megaphone. If he wanted to come out and publicly take a position, Republicans would listen.

The second thing that he had was TPUSA and the little organizations that were built off of it. TPUSA is a very large, 850- to 900-chapter organization. This is a mass mobilization machine. This is a mass talent-building machine, as future political leaders often come from people who were TPUSA chapter leaders in their universities. And then on top of that, he builds these other outreach organizations. He has a giant outreach organization for evangelical church leaders.

Then he has a vote-getting machine that is very active in swing states in the 2024 election — most Republicans seem to think that TPUSA's Turning Point Action Committee might've gotten 10 to 20,000 votes in Arizona, which is basically the margin of a [close] election. They had perfected the strategy of basically primarying people for not being MAGA enough in Arizona, which is TPSUA's organizational home, and they were going to go state to state to state in the near future.

Your third source of power is that he's this connector.

Donors love him. He's famously charismatic. Because he himself had kind of raised up this whole generation of new activists, he knew who was the best potential staffers or the best potential state House candidates or congressional candidates. There are several congressional candidates who came from TPUSA and are in Congress right now. And because he was running this podcast where he's talking to the existing class of staffers, the existing media magnates, the existing politicians, he's at the center of this network of people. And this is probably one of his most important roles in the right, especially the more MAGA right. He was constantly working to get people from one part or one of these constituencies to meet them with somebody else.

You wrote, “There are a good four dozen people in the Trump administration who owe their appointments to an introduction Kirk made on their behalf. And this was not only true of the Trump administration, but also across Congress and state governments and in news agencies like Fox News.“

It's a guesstimate. The number might be underestimated — because Kirk was involved in a very personal way in vetting for this administration's appointments.

You have to understand the right has a problem: We have a much smaller talent pool than the left. And if you are restricting it even further, if you need to restrict your talent pool to people who are more MAGA — people [who] can pass a Laura Loomer test — then you have an even smaller number of potential people. And so Kirk basically spends all the months of November and December and January, every day, meeting with [then-White House personnel director] Sergio Gor, talking about, “Here's somebody who might be good for this position, here's somebody who shouldn't be in that position.” And he wasn't the only one doing that, but he was a big part of getting people in the door and keeping some people out.

But this isn't just true for little [roles]. This is true for Cabinet members. JD Vance is there because of Charlie Kirk.

During 2024, Charlie Kirk took a three-month break from TPUSA to basically be Don Jr.‘s manager. And Kirk sends a text to Don and says [something like], “I know that this guy [Vance] said these things about how Trump was Hitler back in the time, but he's had a conversion. He's one of us now. You need to meet with him. You need to take him seriously. You need to introduce him to your dad.”

That's how JD Vance got in with cahoots with Trump in the first place, just because of Charlie Kirk. If you listen to the Charlie Kirk radio show that JD Vance hosted, he mentions this story. And almost every single person they had from the administration come on has a very similar story. There's half a dozen Cabinet-level or people just below that who can say, “Kirk advocated for me to have this position, and that helped tip the balance.”

You can hear that not just in what they said, but the way in which they said it, in the obvious pathos and emotionality that came across in the discussions of Kirk during that radio broadcast or during the funeral on Sunday night. They all say that they genuinely cared for Kirk. 

Part of me thinks, “Well, everybody on the right wants to have been close to him now.” But listening to you talk and listening to some of the stories people tell, I think this is just actually true: that he really did mean a lot to a lot of the people that are in power right now. And so part of this vehement political reaction to Kirk's death is born out of this deep emotional and personal connection with him.

I think that's correct. If you look at the MAGA movement as a whole, Kirk was a lot of people's friend. That's why all these donors are able to give him so much money. He was very good at being very optimistic and being like, “We're going to win, we can do this,” cheering people up.

This position at the center of the MAGA world network — in addition to these kind of institutional things that he built up, the big megaphone he had, his ability to basically leverage all of that into helping other people make connections — made him sort of an indispensable pillar of the movement.

So when he was shot, that was really not just an attack on somebody who says very controversial things. This is a person who helped pioneer [not only] the message, but also the institutions and the organizational networks of the current version of the right. And he did it by the time he was 31. An immensely talented individual.

One thing that's also struck me in the responses and the way that these figures talk about Kirk's death is the omnipresence of the word “they. It's “they” killed Charlie, “they” took Charlie from us, even though there's no evidence that the shooter was in any kind of conspiracy. 

So what do people on the right mean by “they?”

When George Floyd died in 2020, there was not a sense that this was the action of a single policeman, and if we put him in jail, then the problem's over. There was rather a sense that you could only have a person like this policeman, who's willing to stand on the neck of a Black man he's just arrested until he dies — this could only happen if you have a larger systemic problem in America.

I think many, many people on the right want to have their own version of the 2020 moment, partially because their analysis is very structurally similar to how leftists thought about racism in 2020. They think there's larger structural problems — that [the shooter] only can exist because of a larger culture that supports his conduct, excuses it, and allows it to happen.

All these people went through 2020 and they want to have a similar reckoning, because that was experienced by the right as a very harrowing event — where essentially every single institution in the United States, every university, every provost, most corporations all gave out statements talking about how what happened was an act of evil and we need to nationally atone for the sin. If you didn't agree with that stuff, this felt very oppressive to you, like you were being chased out of the public sphere.

And I think this is the easiest way to make sense of why some people on the right feel very strongly that we need to do things like, say, take Jimmy Kimmel off the air.

They remember 2020, and they feel like if Jimmy Kimmel had gone against Black Lives Matter, he would've been taken off the air without the state. And we don't have that same activist network [as the left], but we do have the state. And so we should try to create the same sort of structural cultural change that was imposed upon us in the Great Awokening.

Help me understand that comparison a little bit more. In the George Floyd scenario, it's pretty easy to see what the structural roots of Derek Chauvin's actions are — a policing sector, and a society more broadly, shot through with racism. 

But in the Kirk case, what's the equivalent force that created Kirk's killer? Is it left-wing animosity toward conservatism? Is it mainstream liberal ideology? What is the thing that the violence against Kirk is supposed to be an outgrowth of? Who specifically are “they” that embody whatever the structure is?

This “they” will differ from person to person. I don't think there's a consensus. The possible options for “they” range from, at the narrowest, the kind of antifa people who are willing to use or at least endorse violence on the left. [At the broadest], it's all the way to a [liberal] culture that sees Trump as inherently illegitimate and un-American and [as someone who] should be deplatformed.

Just to give you an example: Somebody was making a big deal out of a tweet that Vice President Harris had written in 2019, saying how basically, if we're being honest with ourselves, Trump should be kicked off Twitter by now because of his bad comments. That was cited as an example of the left's inherent desire to kick us out of public spaces. Very similar to when Hillary Clinton says, “[Half of] Trump supporters are a basket of deplorables.”

If you're dehumanizing us, if you're calling us deplorable, you're basically saying we're outside of the pale of American politics — then you are part of the “they” who basically dehumanizes someone like Kirk enough that he should be killed. I think that's how they would say it.

I'm not trying to weigh in with my own opinions on this. I just want to understand better what is this “they”? Because to me, it seems analytically incoherent. JD Vance, for example, has brought up the Open Society Foundation, which in no plausible world had anything to do with Charlie Kirk's death. But it was one of Vance's political enemies.

Many actors on the right have for many years believed — and I have a lot of sympathies with this set of beliefs — that a lot of what the left has been about for the last decade, since the Great Awokening started, is basically making it difficult for conservatives to be part of the public sphere in a safe and confident way.

And that word “safe” is interesting because when you start talking about safety, you can start roping in several different streams, which I don't think liberals would necessarily associate with each other, into one system. This allows you to say, okay, people being deplatformed on campuses, that's one version of us not being able to participate publicly. All the way to the riots in 2020, which a lot of conservatives felt Democratic cities and the sitting government allowed — which made it impossible for a person like me to be in these urban spaces for X amount of time. They made these cities too dangerous for us to be in.

And that's where people will do this kind of mining, where, okay, Soros funded this Black Lives Matter-adjacent organization, which was making excuses for rioters here. That's where they'll kind of all connect that together.

Someone like you, you'll look at that and say, “Well, what does that have to do with Charlie Kirk being assassinated by this [lone wolf]?” And I think a lot of people on the right will say, “No, no, no, this is a large systemic thing. All you guys excused the violence in 2020, excused antifa, excused taking over CHAZ, excused all this stuff because you normatively agreed with it and thought that Trump was bad enough that that this sort of violence was okay. And that's the same attitude, that's the same world that creates young guys who want to go and shoot one of our most prominent leaders.”

I think that's how they would connect those dots.

Now, how does that attitude relate to something you talk about in the article at length, which is Kirk's role in giving young conservatives permission to be themselves publicly in places like a university?

This question of what he meant to the young conservatives is quite relevant to this larger question: What is the “they”?

The way I explain it in this piece — this is really hard for liberals to believe — is that, if you were a young conservative on campus from 2013 to 2022, you felt afraid. Even when Trump was in power, a lot of these conservatives felt afraid. And this fear is really core to a lot of what has happened, I mean, really in this administration as well as people's reactions to Kirk's death.

If you were a young person on the right — you believe something like transgenderism is a lie or a mental disease, which is a pretty standard belief on the right — you were afraid to say what you believed because you felt like you would be socially ostracized, people on campus would bully you, harass you, treat you differently, you would have professors who might grade you differently, you wouldn't have good job prospects, you would be afraid of becoming a viral example.

This is the environment in which TPUSA begins its giant rise. And Kirk's campus tours, the sort of thing he was doing when he was shot, this is actually what they're designed to combat. Yes, they created some viral clips, but that really was not their main purpose. Because Kirk was a campus activist first, a media figure second.

The purpose of these was for Kirk to go into these universities and say, “Hey, guys, look, we can be part of the public sphere. There are more of you than it seems. You guys are all afraid to stand up and show you're conservative. I'm going to come here, I'm going to organize a TPUSA chapter, and you're going to see that you're not alone. Second, I'm going to go and debate all these people around you, anyone who wants to come up. A professor, a student, anyone who wants to can come and debate me. And I can show you guys that these beliefs we have are defendable. We can stand up, we can be part of the public sphere.”

And so there's a lot of young conservatives who basically say, “Charlie Kirk made me unafraid to be an activist. Charlie Kirk is the one who made me unafraid to stand up for what I believed.”

Without someone like Charlie, the only people who would stand up for their conservative beliefs tended to be either extremely principled people or they were just assholes who like to be disagreeable. I'm sure you've probably met both of those sorts when you were in college. If you want to have a movement that isn't just people like that, you have to find some way to inspire people to stand up. And that's what Kirk was doing. He's modeling to all these kids, look, you guys can do this too.

And that's who was murdered. And so when the guy whose whole message is “you don't have to be afraid” is shot, then it makes some sense why people might be feeling afraid.

That's where I wanted to bring us to at the end: how both sides should feel about their enemies.

I have this fear, given Kirk's personal significance, that the right's authoritarian reaction to his death is not going to be a short-lived thing — you may disagree. But if Charlie Kirk was trying to create a politics where people who disagree could engage, the aftermath of his death is destroying that possibility. It's making it very, very, very difficult for people across partisan lines to view each other with anything but mistrust and suspicion.

So what are we supposed to do about that?

I think there's a little bit of a crossroads here. I think the right has to decide whether Kirk's life or his death is the thing that should be remembered.

I think that Kirk's life, although many aspects of it are very repellent to people on the left, is an example of how this conservative national populist thing can be done without authoritarian measures and be very popular. I personally am on the side of saying, “Guys, look, Kirk actually showed us the path for how to make this work, and we'd be stupid if we left it for something that we don't know if it will work.”

What I've been telling people on the right is, if you seriously believe you're going to have a 2020 moment, you guys are somewhat deluding yourselves. Because 2020 had very many special things that led up to it.

Obviously, you had a pandemic, everyone was cooped in their house and wanted to get out and be out. But in addition to that, you had years of activism. Black Lives Matter started seven years before 2020. And the New York Times had basically doubled its reporting on racism and racial problems in America in the three years that preceded 2020.

You had a huge amount of intellectual work being done. You had a huge amount of activism being done. And in many ways, 2020 was the culmination of a decade's worth of theorizing and activism and changing public opinion. So I don't think this attempt to use the state to have a 2020 moment is going to work. I just don't think the public is there: I think it's going to backfire.

And I understand, too, that certain people have a bad opinion of Kirk. But I do think that the impulse of some on the left to take this moment to say, “Well, Charlie Kirk was just this terrible person in all these ways, he said this terrible and that terrible thing, and we're being censored if we don't see otherwise” — to put it very frankly, lots of people on the [more radical] right are very happy to see those takes.

The debate the right has been having for a long time is “Do we think that the other side can live with us? How much of a threat really are they to us?” And so when the reaction of some people is to condemn the violence, but then talk about how actually it's good that he's gone, which is more or less what these people do, it sounds more like you are part of this structure of ideas that makes it acceptable for right-wing people to be killed.

A lot of people, a lot of politicians, understand this and have gone out of their way not to be inflammatory on all this. I think clearly this is what [former Vox co-founder and now New York Times columnist] Ezra Klein was thinking when he wrote that editorial. But he got dragged through the mud for that, and he really had to justify himself showing up, talking to people on the right.

Maybe it's helpful if folks on the left don't just discount Kirk as that terrible racist who says all these terrible things. If that's the message you took away from all this, I think you'll really misunderstand both what Kirk meant to the movement, but also what his death means to the movement as well.

More than 100 people have died in the flooding and more than 160 are believed to be missing.  

Camp Mystic, a long-running private Christian girls' summer camp where 27 girls and counselors died in Texas flooding on the Fourth of July, will reopen next year, according to the camp's operators.

The camp will reopen in conjunction with its 100th anniversary and one year after the deadly flash floods that swept through the site along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County this summer.

The summer camp made the announcement on Monday in an email to families enrolled in the 2025 camp. Some families have criticized the camp over its safety measures and preparedness in the wake of the tragedy.

Leaders said they will reopen Camp Mystic Cypress Lake, a sister site opened in 2020 that was not destroyed by the flood. The original campus, which is located along the Guadalupe River and suffered "devastating damage," will remain closed, and is not expected to reopen next year, officials added.

"As we work to finalize plans, we will do so in a way that is mindful of those we have lost," the letter said, according to The Associated Press.

The owners said they will be designing and building a memorial "dedicated to the lives of the campers and counselors lost on July 4th," according to ABC News.

"We hope this space will serve as a place of reflection and remembrance of these beautiful girls," the camp's statement read. "We continue to pray for the grieving families and all those who lost loved ones."

The letter also said leaders are working with engineers and other experts to determine how the camp will implement safety changes required under newly passed state laws.

FAITH BRINGS LIGHT TO DEVASTATED TEXAS TOWN AFTER DEADLY FLOODING DISASTER

The news has drawn a mixed reaction. Some family members of the deceased strongly oppose the planned reopening, while alumni and the Eastland family, who own the property, have expressed support.

Cici Steward, whose 8-year-old daughter, Cile, remains missing, said, "The truth is, Camp Mystic failed our daughters.

"For my family, these months have felt like an eternity. For the camp, it seems like nothing more than a brief pause before business as usual," she added in a statement Tuesday to The New York Times. "Camp Mystic is pressing ahead with reopening, even if it means inviting girls to swim in the same river that may potentially still hold my daughter's body."

Other parents said they had received almost no other communication from the camp in the months after the flood, then were suddenly notified by email that Mystic planned to reopen.

Blake Bonner, whose 9-year-old daughter, Lila, died in the flooding, told the Times the families were not consulted about, nor did they approve the memorial the camp announced.

The campers and counselors were killed when the fast-rising floodwaters roared through a low-lying area of the summer camp before dawn on July 4, 2025. 

The destructive flooding killed at least 136 people in the region, prompting widespread criticism of local preparedness. 

County leaders were asleep or out of town, the AP reported. The head of Camp Mystic had been tracking the weather beforehand, but it's unclear whether he saw an urgent warning from the National Weather Service that had triggered an emergency alert to phones in the area, a spokesperson for the camp's operators said in the immediate aftermath.

The camp, established in 1926, did not evacuate and was hit hard when the river rose from 14 feet to 29.5 feet within 60 minutes.

White House 'border czar' Tom Homan discusses California Gov. Gavin Newsom's law banning masks for law enforcement, the deportation operations and responds to bribery allegations on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Federal officials are making an example of a Santa Monica man arrested this week for allegedly doxxing and harassing an ICE attorney, with the architect of Los Angeles' and Chicago's raids warning any copycats.

Gregory Curcio faces up to five years in prison if convicted, after the Justice Department said he allegedly published private or identifying information about an ICE attorney "with malicious intent."

ICE Operation "At Large" Commander Gregory Bovino tweeted overnight that anyone who targets immigration officers like Curcio should take notice.

"Dox our agents? You'll end up being charged just like this man found out," said Bovino, whose noted social media presence and prominent public persona have been both a cause célèbre for supporters of President Donald Trump's mass deportation agenda, and a source of outrage for liberal opponents.

Bill Essayli, the Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney for Central California, took the message one step further.

Essayli said Curcio's arrest proves why ICE agents must be allowed to shield their identity, which now conflicts with a recently-passed California law banning law enforcement from doing so.

Essayli, a Republican and the first Muslim elected to the California State Assembly, lambasted critics of federal agents who mask-up during public operations.

"Why do our agents wear masks? Gregory John Curcio, 68, of Santa Monica was arrested and charged today with doxxing an ICE attorney," Essayli said in a statement on social media.

"We will not tolerate the harassment -- online or otherwise -- of federal law enforcement," he added.

"We will find and arrest those who release personal information of federal agents or their families. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty in court."

The Justice Department said Curcio was arrested Monday and appeared Tuesday before a federal judge in Los Angeles who ordered him jailed without bond ahead of an October arraignment.

"Contrary to what some misguided individuals think, doxxing federal agents and employees is not a harmless crime," Essayli added in a Justice Department statement.

"It endangers the agent's personal safety and that of their family."

Prosecutors say Curcio posted an ICE attorney's home address in February and urged others to "SWAT" her — a term for making false 911 calls to provoke an armed law enforcement response.

The attorney claimed to police she had never met the suspect but that he once lived in an apartment building owned by her mother, and that he would harass the parent as far back as January 2024.

ICE's Office of Responsibility is also investigating the case.

On Saturday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the first-in-the-nation law prohibiting most law enforcement from obscuring their faces during official business.

It was seen as a direct response to raids in Los Angeles engineered by Bovino, which resulted in mass protests from the left and widespread praise from the right and at the White House, where President Donald Trump federalized the California National Guard and deployed assets to America's second-largest city.

Newsom said Saturday that the diversity that "makes California great" is "under assault," while adding the impact of the Trump administration's policies across the Golden State is "terrifying."

"It's like a dystopian sci-fi movie. Unmarked cars, people in masks, people quite literally disappearing. No due process, no rights, no rights in a democracy where we have rights. Immigrants have rights, and we have the right to stand up and push back," Newsom said.

DALLAS (AP) — A shooter with a rifle opened fire from a nearby roof onto a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement location in Dallas on Wednesday, killing two detainees and wounding another before taking his own life, authorities said.

The exact motivation of the attack was not immediately known. The FBI said at a morning news conference that ammunition found at the scene contained anti-ICE messaging. The head of the agency, Kash Patel, released a photo on social media that shows a bullet containing the words “ANTI-ICE” written in what appears to be marker.

“The shooter fired indiscriminately at the ICE building, including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a release.

The detainee who survived was in critical condition at a hospital, DHS said.

Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News that no ICE agents were injured.

“We believe he was shooting at law enforcement and detainees from an apartment building,” McLaughlin said. “Detainees were among the victims of the shooting.”

The FBI said during the news conference that it was investigating the shooting as “an act of targeted violence.”

The attack is the latest public, targeted killing in the U.S. and comes two weeks after conservative leader Charlie Kirk was killed by a rifle-wielding shooter on a roof.

Officers responded to a call to assist an officer on North Stemmons Freeway around 6:40 a.m. Wednesday and determined that someone opened fire at a government building from an adjacent building, Dallas police spokesperson Officer Jonathen E. Maner said in an email.




Edwin Cardona, an immigrant from Venezuela, said he was entering the ICE building with his son for an appointment at around 6:20 a.m. when he heard gunshots.

An agent gathered people who were inside the building, took them to a more secure area and explained that there was an active shooter in the area, Cardona said.

“I was afraid for my family because my family was outside. I felt terrible because I thought something could happen to them. Thank God no,” Cardona said.

Cardona said his family was brought into the building, and they were later reunited.

The ICE facility is along Interstate 35 East, just southwest of Dallas Love Field, a large commercial airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and blocks from hotels catering to airport travelers.




Traffic cameras near the scene showed six lanes of a normally busy freeway empty, with cars and semitrailers ground to a halt on an interstate exit. Dozens of emergency vehicles were seen near the facility.

Shortly after the shooting and before officials said at least one of the victims was a detainee, Vice President JD Vance posted on the social platform X that “the obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.”

U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz from Texas continued in that direction, calling for an end to politically motivated violence.

“To every politician who is using rhetoric demonizing ICE and demonizing CPB: stop,” Cruz told reporters, referencing Customs and Border Protection.

But immediately after the news conference in which officials refused to say whether the victims included detainees, Democratic U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey called in to Dallas' WFAA-TV newscast and told them he was “absolutely sickened” by some officials' comments.

“If they are trying to control this narrative and they don't want migrants to be the victim in this story, then they may want to slow-walk giving us any information about this so they can still keep on talking about attacks on ICE,” Veasey said.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said details were still emerging, but the agency was confirming there were “multiple injuries and fatalities” at the field office. Noem said the motive remained unclear, but noted there has been an uptick in targeting of ICE agents.

A July 4 attack at a Texas immigration detention center injured a police officer, who was shot in the neck. Attackers dressed in black military-style clothing opened fire outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, federal prosecutors said. At least 11 people have been charged in connection with the attack.

A man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents as they were leaving a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen on July 7. The man, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, injured a police officer who responded to the scene before authorities shot and killed him. Police later found other weaponry, ammunition and backpacks inside his car.

In his speech before the U.N. General Assembly, President Donald Trump promoted a second-term talking point about his efforts to settle multiple conflicts around the world.

“In a period of just seven months, I have ended seven unendable wars. They said they were unendable.” he said Tuesday, repeating a claim he frequently makes.

Trump has helped with mediations but experts say his impact is not as clear-cut as he portrays.

Here's a closer look:

Trump is credited with ending the 12-day war.

In June, Israel launched attacks on the heart of Iran's nuclear program and military leadership, saying it wanted to stop Tehran from building a nuclear weapon. Iran has denied it was trying to do that.

Trump negotiated a ceasefire after directing American warplanes to strike Iran's Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites. 

Evelyn Farkas, executive director of Arizona State University's McCain Institute, said Trump should get credit for ending the war.

“There's always a chance it could flare up again if Iran restarts its nuclear weapons program, but nonetheless, they were engaged in a hot war with one another,” she said. “And it didn't have any real end in sight before President Trump got involved and gave them an ultimatum.”

Lawrence Haas, a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the American Foreign Policy Council who is an expert on Israel-Iran tensions, agreed the U.S. was instrumental in securing the ceasefire. But he characterized it as a “temporary respite” from the ongoing “day-to-day cold war” between the two countries that often involves flare-ups.

This could be described as tensions at best, and peace efforts, which do not directly involve the United States, have stalled.

The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile River has caused friction among Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan since the power-generating project was announced more than a decade ago. In July, Ethiopia declared the project complete. It was inaugurated this month.

Egypt and Sudan oppose the dam. Although the vast majority of the water that flows down the Nile originates in Ethiopia, Egyptian agriculture relies on the river almost entirely. Sudan fears flooding and wants to protect its own power-generating dams.

During his first term, Trump tried to broker a deal between Ethiopia and Egypt. He could not get the countries to agree and suspended aid to Ethiopia over the dispute. In July, he posted on Truth Social that he helped the “fight over the massive dam (and) there is peace at least for now.” But the disagreement persists, and negotiations between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan have stalled.

“It would be a gross overstatement to say that these countries are at war,” Haas said. “I mean, they're just not.”

The April killing of tourists in Indian-controlled Kashmir pushed India and Pakistan closer to war than they had been in years, but a ceasefire was reached.

Trump has claimed that the U.S. brokered the ceasefire, which he said came about in part because he offered trade concessions. Pakistan thanked Trump, recommending him for the Nobel Peace Prize. India has denied Trump's claims, saying there was no conversation between the U.S. and India on trade in regards to the ceasefire.

Although India played down the Trump administration's role in the ceasefire, Haas and Farkas believe the U.S. deserves some credit for helping stop the fighting.

“I think that President Trump played a constructive role from all accounts, but it may not have been decisive. And again, I'm not sure whether you would define that as a full-blown war,” Farkas said.

The White House lists the conflict between these countries as one Trump resolved. But there has been no threat of a war between the two neighbors during Trump's second term or any significant contribution from the Republican president this year to improve their relations.

Kosovo is a former Serbian province that declared independence in 2008. Tensions have persisted since, but never to the point of war, mostly because NATO-led peacekeepers have been deployed in Kosovo, which has been recognized by more than 100 countries.

During his first term, Trump negotiated a wide-ranging deal between Serbia and Kosovo, but much of what was agreed on was never carried out.

Trump has played a key role in peace efforts between the African neighbors, but he is hardly alone and the conflict is far from over.

Eastern Congo, rich in minerals, has been battered by fighting with more than 100 armed groups. The most potent is the M23 rebel group. It is backed by neighboring Rwanda, which claims it is protecting its territorial interests and that some of those who participated in the 1994 Rwandan genocide fled to Congo and are working with the Congolese army.

The Trump administration's efforts paid off in June, when the Congolese and Rwandan foreign ministers signed a peace deal at the White House. The M23, however, was not directly involved in the U.S.-facilitated negotiations and said it could not abide by the terms of an agreement that did not involve it.

The final step to peace was meant to be a separate Qatar-facilitated deal between Congo and M23 that would bring about a permanent ceasefire. There have been no public signs of major talks between Congo and M23 on the final terms.

In August, Trump hosted the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan at the White House, where they signed a deal aimed at ending a decades-long conflict. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan called the signed document a “significant milestone.” Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev hailed Trump for performing “a miracle.”

The agreements were intended to reopen key transportation routes and reaffirm Armenia's and Azerbaijan's commitment to signing a peace treaty. The treaty's text was initialed by the countries' foreign ministers at that meeting, which indicated preliminary approval. But the two countries have yet to sign and ratify the deal.

Armenia and Azerbaijan have been in a bitter conflict over territory since the early 1990s, when ethnic Armenian forces took control of the Karabakh province, known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh, and nearby territories. In 2020, Azerbaijan's military recaptured broad swaths of territory. Russia brokered a truce and deployed about 2,000 peacekeepers to the region.

In September 2023, Azerbaijani forces launched a lightning blitz to retake remaining portions. The two countries have worked toward normalizing ties and signing a peace treaty ever since.

Officials from Thailand and Cambodia credit Trump with pushing the Asian neighbors to agree to a ceasefire in this summer's brief border conflict.

Cambodia and Thailand clashed in the past over their shared border. The latest fighting began in July after a land mine explosion along the border wounded five Thai soldiers. Tensions had been growing since May, when a Cambodian soldier was killed in a confrontation that created a diplomatic rift and roiled Thai politics.

Both countries agreed in late July to an unconditional ceasefire during a meeting in Malaysia. 

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim pressed for the pact, but there was little headway until Trump intervened. Trump said on social media that he warned the Thai and Cambodian leaders that the U.S. would not move forward with trade agreements if the hostilities continued. Both countries faced economic difficulties and neither had reached tariff deals with the U.S., though most of their Southeast Asian neighbors had.

According to Ken Lohatepanont, a political analyst and University of Michigan doctoral candidate, “President Trump's decision to condition a successful conclusion to these talks on a ceasefire likely played a significant role in ensuring that both sides came to the negotiating table when they did.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — When President Donald Trump's administration announced it would repurpose an old, generic drug as a new treatment for autism, it came as a surprise to many experts — including the physician who suggested the idea to the nation's top health officials.

Dr. Richard Frye told The Associated Press that he'd been talking with federal regulators about developing his own customized version of the drug for children with autism, assuming more research would be required.

“So we were kinda surprised that they were just approving it right out of the gate without more studies or anything,” said Frye, an Arizona-based child neurologist who has a book and online education business focused on the experimental treatment.

It's another example of the haphazard rollout of the Trump administration's Monday announcement on autism, which critics say has elevated an unproven drug that needs far more study before being approved as a credible treatment for the complex brain disease.

A spokesperson for the Republican administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday morning.

The nation's leading autism groups and researchers quickly distanced themselves from the decision on leucovorin, a derivative of vitamin B, calling the studies supporting its use “very weak” and ”very small.”

“We have nothing resembling even moderate evidence that leucovorin is an effective treatment for autism symptoms,” said David Mandell, a psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania.




Mandell and other researchers say the evidence suggests autism is mostly rooted in genetics, with input from other factors, including the age of the child's father.

Nevertheless, a growing number of doctors are prescribing the medication, repurposing versions used for chemotherapy or ordering new formulations from compounding pharmacies.

Many researchers agree the drug warrants additional study, particularly for patients with a deficiency of folate, or vitamin B9, in the brain that may play a role in autism. But for now, they say, it should only be taken in carefully controlled clinical trials.

“We often say our job is to stay between the yellow lines,” said Dr. Lawrence Gray, a pediatric developmental specialist at Northwestern University. “When people just decide to go outside of current guidelines, then they're outside of that. And nobody knows what's going to happen out there.”

The case for leucovorin's use in autism begins with established science but quickly veers into uncertain terrain.

When metabolized, the drug turns into folate, which is essential for healthy prenatal development and is recommended before and during pregnancy. But far less is known about its role after birth.

The issue caught the attention of Frye and others more than 20 years ago, when research suggested some people with autism had low levels of folate in the brain due to antibodies blocking the vitamin's absorption.

The theory linking autism to folate levels was mostly abandoned, however, after research showed that the siblings of people with autism can also have low folates without any symptoms of the condition.

“I honestly thought this had died out as a theory for autism and was shocked to see its reemergence,” Mandell said.

In 2018, Frye and his colleagues published a study of 48 children in which those taking leucovorin performed better on several language measures than those taking a placebo.

Four small studies in other countries, including China and Iran, showed similar results, albeit using different doses, metrics and statistical analyses, which researchers say is problematic.

Frye struggled to get funding to continue within the traditional academic system.

“I decided to move out of academia to be more innovative and actually do some of this stuff,” he said. 

Earlier this year, Frye and several other researchers formed a new entity, the Autism Discovery Coalition, to pitch their work to Trump administration officials including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

“After Kennedy got in, we thought they'd hopefully be friendly to autism scientists,” he said.

An August meeting with National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya quickly led to further discussions with the Food and Drug Administration about testing a proprietary, purified version of leucovorin.

A new formulation of the decades-old drug would mean new patents, allowing Frye and his yet-to-formed drug company to charge far more than the cheap generics currently on the market.

“We have a lot of investors who are excited about leucovorin and want to do something high quality for kids with autism,” he said.

But the FDA's announcement Monday may have scuttled that plan. Instead of previewing a new version, the agency said it would simply update the label on the generic drug to mention use in boosting folate brain levels, including for patients with autism. That's expected to encourage more doctors to prescribe it and insurers to cover it.

Specialists who have spent decades treating autistic patients say it's important to proceed carefully and methodically.

Gray recalls other experimental treatments that initially looked promising only to fail in larger studies.

“Small studies often find populations that are very motivated,” Gray said. “But when those therapies are moved into larger studies, the initial positive findings often disappear.”

Among the challenges facing leucovorin: There isn't agreement about what portion of autism patients have the folate-blocking antibodies supposedly targeted by the drug.

Frye screens his patients for the antibodies using a test developed at a laboratory at the State University of New York. Like many specialty tests, it has not been reviewed by the FDA.

Gray says the only way to definitively test for the antibodies would be by extracting cranial fluid from children with autism through a spinal tap.

“That's a big limiting factor in having these large, randomized controlled trials,” Gray said.

While the Trump administration discusses fast-tracking leucovorin, interest in the drug continues to swirl online, including in forums and social media groups for parents of children with autism.

Brian Noonan, of Phoenix, found out about the drug earlier this year after asking ChatGPT for the best autism drug options for his 4-year-old son.

The FDA has never approved any drug for the underlying causes of autism, but the chatbot directed Noonan to Frye's research.

After an evaluation and confirmatory blood test, the boy started on a formulation of the drug from a compounding pharmacy in June.

Within days, Noonan says, he saw improvement in his son's ability to make eye contact and form sentences.

“He's not cured, but these are just areas of improvement,” Noonan said. “It's been a big thing for us.”

Iran has begun rebuilding missile-production sites targeted by Israel during its 12-day war in June, satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press show, but a key component is likely still missing — the large mixers needed to produce solid fuel for the weapons.

WHY THIS MATTERS: Reconstituting the missile program is crucial for Iran, which believes another round of war with Israel may happen. The missiles are one of Iran's few military deterrents after the 12-day war with Israel in June decimated its air defense systems.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran has begun rebuilding missile-production sites targeted by Israel during its 12-day war in June, satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press show, but a key component is likely still missing — the large mixers needed to produce solid fuel for the weapons.

Reconstituting the missile program is crucial for the Islamic Republic, which believes another round of war with Israel may happen. The missiles are one of Iran's few military deterrents after the war decimated its air defense systems — something that Tehran long has insisted will never be included in negotiations with the West.

Missile experts told AP that obtaining the mixers is a goal for Tehran, particularly as it prepares for possible United Nations sanctions to be reimposed on the country later this month. The sanctions would penalize any development of the missile program, among other measures. In an address to the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian blamed the Israeli attacks and the separate U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites for “dealing a grievous blow” to peace negotiations.

Known as planetary mixers, the machines feature blades that revolve around a central point, like orbiting planets, and offer better mixing action than other types of equipment. Iran could purchase them from China, where experts and U.S. officials say they've purchased missile fuel ingredients and other components in the past.

“If they're able to reacquire some key things like planetary mixers, then that infrastructure is still there and ready to get rolling again,” said Sam Lair, a research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies who studied Iranian missile sites.

Iran's mission to the United Nations did not respond to questions about the country's efforts to rebuild its missile program.

Solid-fuel missiles can be fired faster than those using liquid fuel, which must be loaded just before launch. That speed can make the difference between launching a missile and having it destroyed in a launcher — something that happened during the war with Israel.

Iran has solid-fuel missile manufacturing bases at Khojir and Parchin, two sites just outside Tehran, as well as at Shahroud, some 350 kilometers (215 miles) northeast of the capital. Even before the most recent war, all of those sites came under Israeli attack in October 2024 during hostilities between the countries.






Attacks during the war in June appeared aimed at destroying buildings that housed the mixers, which are needed to ensure the missile fuel is evenly combined, according to experts. Other sites struck by Israel included manufacturing facilities that likely could be used to make the mixers.

Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC taken this month and analyzed by AP show construction at both the Parchin and Shahroud facilities.

At Parchin, mixing buildings appear to be under repair, Lair said, and similar rebuilding is happening at Shahroud involving mixing buildings and other structures.




The speed at which Iran is rebuilding shows the importance Tehran puts on its missile program. Iran's bombed nuclear sites so far have not seen the same level of activity.

During the war, Iran fired 574 ballistic missiles at Israel, according to the Washington-based Jewish Institute for National Security of America, which has a close relationship with the Israeli military. In two exchanges of fire before the war, Iran launched another 330 missiles, the think tank said.

The Israeli military had estimated Iran's total arsenal at around 2,500 missiles, meaning that over a third of its missiles were fired.

Before the war, Iran was on track to be able to produce more than 200 solid-fuel missiles a month, said Carl Parkin, a summer fellow at the James Martin Center. That drew Israeli strikes to missile-building facilities.

“Israel's targeting indicates that they believed mixing was a bottleneck in Iran's missile production,” he said. “If Iran is able to overcome their mixing limitations, they'll have all the casting capacity that they need to start producing at high volumes again.”

The Israeli military declined to respond to questions over its strategy. Iran's defense minister, Gen. Aziz Nasirzadeh, recently claimed Tehran now has new missiles with more advanced warheads.

“The 12-day war with Israel has altered some of our priorities,” he said on Aug. 22. “We are now focused on producing military equipment with higher precision and greater operational capabilities.”

Iran may choose to rely on China to obtain mixers and the chemicals to make solid fuel.

Such chemicals may have caused a massive explosion in April that killed at least 70 people at a port in Iran. Iran still has not explained the blast, which happened as its diplomats met with Americans in Oman over its nuclear program.

Just days after the explosion, the U.S. State Department sanctioned Chinese firms it said provided the Islamic Republic with “ballistic missile propellant ingredients.”

Meanwhile, Iran's Revolutionary Guard likely supplied a planetary mixer to an underground ballistic missile construction facility in Syria near the town of Masyaf, some 170 kilometers (105 miles) north of the capital, Damascus, near the Lebanese border. Footage released by the Israeli military months after the September 2024 raid on the facility showed the mixer, which bore a resemblance to others sold online by Chinese firms.

Iran's president and military officials visited Beijing earlier this month for China's Victory Day parade. Iran's government has provided no detailed readout on what Pezeshkian said to Chinese President Xi Jinping, and China's state-run media offered no indications that Tehran asked for help.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry, asked about possibly supplying Tehran mixers and fuel ingredients, told AP that Beijing is “willing to continue leveraging its influence to contribute to peace and stability in the Middle East.”

“China supports Iran in safeguarding its national sovereignty, security and national dignity,” the ministry said. “At the same time, China is deeply concerned about the continued escalation of tensions in the Middle East.”

Can Kasapoğlu, a senior fellow with the Washington-based Hudson Institute, said Beijing could supply guidance systems and microprocessors as well for Iran's ballistic missiles.

“If Iran uses its relationship with China to bolster its disruptive military capabilities, the 12-day war could be a mere speed bump for the Iranian regime, rather than a decisive defeat,” he wrote.

Lair, the analyst, said if Iran restarts its production at prewar levels, the sheer number of missiles produced will make it harder for the Israelis to preemptively destroy them or shoot them down.

“They are clearly very invested in their missile program, and I don't think that they're going to negotiate it away, ever,” he said.

The president's plans for Memphis resemble the aggressive, showy, and ultimately failed crime-fighting strategy once used by the city's police.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

When President Donald Trump describes his plans to deploy the National Guard to Memphis as a “replica” of what he's done with federal troops in Washington, D.C., he's attempting to make two points: first, that it's appropriate for him to deploy the military in American cities at all, and second, that doing so effectively reduces crime in cities that just happen to be run and disproportionately populated by his perceived political foes. But the vision he has laid out to “make Memphis safe again” is familiar in another key way: It looks a lot like the crime-fighting strategy the city tried just a few years ago—one that ultimately failed.

The president signed an executive memorandum on September 15 directing federal agents to combat street crime in Memphis through “hypervigilant policing,” “aggressive prosecutions,” and “strict enforcement of applicable quality-of-life, nuisance, and public-safety laws.” The memo called for “large-scale saturation of besieged neighborhoods” and highlighted issues such as graffiti, noise, public intoxication, and traffic violations as areas of focus for federal agents set to descend on the city.

All of this sounds remarkably similar to what Memphis tried previously—an effort that, according to the Department of Justice, had disastrous results. “We have reasonable cause to believe that MPD and the City engage in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the Constitution and federal law,” DOJ investigators wrote in a December 2024 report on the Memphis Police Department's activities, sharply rebuking a policing style that managed to antagonize local residents while doing little to solve or prevent violent crime. “First, MPD uses excessive force. Second, MPD makes unlawful stops, searches, and arrests. Third, MPD unlawfully discriminates against Black people when enforcing the law.”

In response to that report—which found that crime had worsened despite the city's constitutionally questionable crackdown—Memphis leaders said they had already intervened to stop the most egregious abuses. But with the support of Tennessee's Republican state leaders, Trump now appears eager to return to the “saturation-style enforcement” that the Justice Department said was effective at arresting thousands of Memphians for traffic violations and nonviolent offenses but abysmal at catching the gang members and other criminals driving the city's high violent-crime rate.

From the July/August 2008 issue: American murder mystery

As Trump redirects his anti-crime crusade to Republican-run states—St. Louis and New Orleans have been floated as targets for future troop deployments—the president is finding little resistance from their governors. This removes a significant obstacle that had complicated his plans to send Guardsmen into Chicago and Baltimore. But Memphis, like other blue cities in conservative states, is a fraught target for other reasons. Although Trump's threats to send Guardsmen into states with a Democratic governor tend to spark unified opposition from state and local leaders, his recent pivot has exposed tensions between state and local officials over race, local control, gun laws, and tax dollars.

JB Smiley Jr., a member of the Memphis City Council, told me he feared that Trump's federal surge would disproportionately target Black residents and undocumented immigrants for petty violations, while doing little to solve serious crimes and address gun violence. “If your goal is to send troops there hoping something goes wrong so that you can send in a more aggressive military occupation, then I think this is what you do,” he said.

Most of the people I spoke with in Memphis acknowledged that the city does have a serious crime problem. Although violence has decreased significantly this year—overall crime is at a 25-year low, police said this month—Memphis ended 2024 with the highest rate of violent crime in the nation, according to FBI data. In recent years, homicides have regularly topped 300 a year in the city of about 630,000—a murder rate that the White House recently noted was four times higher than that of Mexico City. When I asked officials in Memphis why the city's crime rate had remained so high, several pointed to a 2021 state law allowing for permitless open carry of firearms, saying that it has exacerbated gun violence. In November, Memphis residents voted heavily in favor of a referendum opposing permitless gun ownership, although the superseding state law has blocked the city ordinance from going into effect. More than 90 percent of recent murders in the city involved a firearm. Trump's memo on “Restoring Law and Order in Memphis,” however, does not mention gun violence.

Bill Lee, Tennessee's Republican governor, has already begun dispatching dozens of state troopers into Memphis ahead of the expected arrival of federal troops. Lee, who went to the White House last week to personally thank Trump for the troop deployment, said he hoped the effort would result in “sustained crime lowering.” But Lee and the National Guard are still sorting out the details, which has delayed what had been expected to be an imminent deployment. It could be weeks before troops are in Memphis, a Pentagon official speaking on the condition of anonymity told The Atlantic. Among the challenges are federal budgetary concerns due to the end of the fiscal year and a possible government shutdown, the official said.

In the meantime, the state troopers have focused on traffic stops, issuing hundreds of tickets in recent days, local officials told me. The push is reminiscent of a strategy Memphians have become accustomed to—and, in many cases, annoyed with—even as their city has become more violent. Over a five-year period ending in 2023, officers in Memphis issued three times as many tickets as did their counterparts in the more populous city of Nashville, making 800,000 traffic stops and issuing 300,000 tickets, according to the Department of Justice. During that same period, murders in the city increased from 186 to 348 annually.

The strategy resembles one of the tactics federal agents have employed in Washington, D.C., during the surge that began last month. Police checkpoints were set up to stop people for traffic infractions, and officers tended to use the stops as an opportunity to check drivers' immigration status or search for outstanding warrants. White House officials credit the highly visible efforts with bringing down rates of carjackings and other crimes, although criminal-justice experts have suggested that such decreases are likely to be short-lived. “There's certainly literature out there that says increased police presence, in terms of the volume of law-enforcement officers, can reduce crime—but sometimes it doesn't,” Nancy La Vigne, the dean of the Rutgers Newark School of Criminal Justice, told me. “And even if it works in the short run, it can do so much damage to community trust that it's going to hurt in the long run.”

Trust between Memphis residents and law enforcement is already strained, said La Vigne, who led the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice during the Biden administration. She cited the 2023 police killing of Tyre Nichols, who was beaten by several Memphis police officers after a traffic stop. Video footage of Nichols crying for his mother while being punched, kicked, and hit with a baton led to nationwide protests and ultimately forced MPD to disband a street-crime unit that had been known for escalatory practices.

The killing of Nichols, by members of that unit, also drew the attention of the Justice Department. Investigators launched a 17-month investigation of the Memphis police, which culminated in the aforementioned report. It found that Memphis officers would violently retaliate against people who mouthed off at them, punch and kick suspects who were already handcuffed, and engage in stop-and-frisk searches without probable cause. Black Memphians such as Nichols, the department found, were disproportionately targeted for abuse. In May, Trump's DOJ closed its investigation into MPD and retracted the report's findings. The five officers involved in Nichols's death, who are also Black, have each either pleaded guilty or been convicted of various federal and state charges related to the killing. A Tennessee jury acquitted three of the officers on additional charges, including second-degree murder, in May.

Trump has regularly complained that departmental guidelines and constitutional restrictions force police officers to be less “tough” than the criminals they are pursuing. Speaking to New York City cops in 2017, Trump urged them to “please don't be too nice” when making arrests. In recent days, he has repeatedly complained about police officers who stand still and accept a verbal onslaught from protesters yelling in their face. “I say when they spit, you hit,” Trump said at the White House last week, describing his advice to federal officials set to deploy to Tennessee. “You can do whatever you want. You do whatever the hell you want.”

In a statement, the White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson pointed out Memphis's elevated crime rates and asserted that Trump's efforts would reduce them. “Following the President's highly successful operation to combat violent crime in DC, which objectively drove down crime rates across the board, numerous Tennessee officials have applauded the President's decision to address crime in Memphis next,” she wrote. “Just as we did in DC, the Administration will work closely with local law enforcement to ensure the success and sustainability of the operation. Addressing crime will benefit all who live in and visit Memphis.”

The Memphis Police Department and Lee's office did not respond to requests for comment. Trump's push to send what he has called “rough-looking” federal troops into cities such as Memphis raises complex questions of race and class, Russell Wigginton, the president of the Memphis-based National Civil Rights Museum, told me. The museum, located at the site where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, has been a gathering point when the majority-Black city has faced racial tension, he said. “For people of a certain age in Memphis, the connotation of the National Guard is traumatic—because they go straight back to imagery of Dr. King on that balcony in front of room 306,” he said, noting that thousands of Guardsmen deployed to the city before and after King's murder, in 1968.

Read: The murders in Memphis aren't stopping

Memphis's mayor, its police chief, and most of the city's officers are Black. The group of leaders Trump assembled last week at the White House to announce the “Memphis Safe Task Force” and discuss the city's future—Lee, Senators Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, and a cadre of Cabinet officials—were almost exclusively white. Several Memphians I spoke with flagged the dynamic as troubling. Wigginton called it “jarring.”

City leaders have said they would welcome federal help to combat violent crime, particularly to address Memphis's low clearance rates for the most serious offenses. Memphis police arrested a suspect in only 28 percent of murders in 2022 and 14 percent of murders in 2023, well below the national rate of 50 percent, according to FBI data. The clearance rates for nonfatal shootings have been even lower. Given the seriousness of the crime problem, Trump's memo highlighting “public intoxication” and “unpermitted disturbances and demonstrations” has led to a fair share of eye rolling among local officials, Tami Sawyer, the general-sessions court clerk for Shelby County, which includes Memphis, told me. “They're going to come arrest people for vagrancy and loitering and noise and graffiti, but they're not going to take the guns out of circulation,” said Sawyer, who oversees much of the operation for the misdemeanor court cases and the jail in downtown Memphis.

She said that the jail is already overcrowded and the air-conditioning in one of the buildings went out earlier this month, leaving those inside to broil during 90-degree days. “We're lucky that we haven't had a riot yet,” she told me.

The Trump administration has done little to coordinate with local officials. Whereas Trump had the power to seize control of the D.C. police department and could rely on federal prosecutors to embrace his approach to charging crimes, the president's authority is more limited outside the nation's capital. A spokesperson for Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy, who would be responsible for deciding whether to charge many of the people swept up in any crackdown, told me last week that he was still waiting to receive a briefing from the Trump administration.

Memphis Mayor Paul Young said he learned of Trump's decision to deploy troops when the president made the announcement on Fox News. Young has said he opposes the idea. Several officials have pointed out that the Trump administration abruptly cut a $1.7 million grant for a local nonprofit focused on violence prevention, and will likely spend many times that amount on the troop deployment.

Meanwhile, residents told me that they have little choice but to wait and see whether the presence of soldiers once again marching through their city will deter crime or only further inflame tensions.

“Memphis has its problems just like any other city—but we're not just this dystopia of foolishness and violence and crime,” Justin Brooks, who handles student recruitment for Christian Brothers University in Memphis, told me. “I hope that while the Guard is stationed here, that it actually benefits us. That's the biggest thing. We fought enough about Is it going to happen? Now it's going to happen, and it's like, What now?”

Along Estonia's border with Russia, authorities are preparing for a potential conflict between NATO and Russia by extending a new border fence and building anti-tank ditches and bunkers. But those defenses won't stop the immediate threat the alliance faces from drones and electronic warfare. (AP video shot by Hendrik Osula, Production by Lorna Petty)

VINSKI, Estonia (AP) — Estonia is extending a fence along its border with Russia and building anti-tank ditches and bunkers in preparation for a potential conflict with Moscow. But those defenses won't guard against the threat that Estonia and its NATO allies face from Russian drones and electronic warfare.

From the Baltics to the Black Sea, countries bordering Russia, Belarus and Ukraine are facing the spillover from Moscow's war in Ukraine.

The incursion of about 20 Russian drones into Poland this month shone a spotlight on holes in NATO's air defenses, as multimillion-dollar jets had to be scrambled to respond to drones that cost thousands and that ended up crashing into the Polish countryside. Russia denied that it targeted Poland, but Polish officials suggested that it was intentional.

Faced with a growing problem, some European Union defense ministers will meet Friday to discuss creating a “drone wall.”

NATO warned Russia on Tuesday that it would defend against any further breaches of its airspace, after Estonia said that Russian fighter jets violated it last week. But although the alliance knows how to identify threats from jets and missiles, dealing with drones is a greater challenge, officials said. 

In Poland, “most of the drones were not detected,” Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said. “This is a real gap we have to solve.”

Military and defense officials from the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — NATO and EU members that border Russia — told The Associated Press that defending against drones requires solving a complex set of technological, financial and bureaucratic problems.




Europe needs cheaper technology to buy and to speed up slow production and procurement cycles, they said. But even then, drone technology is advancing so quickly that anything bought now could be outdated in months. 

“What I need,” said Lt. General Andrus Merilo, who commands Estonia's military, is technology that is “good enough, it's affordable and can be produced in mass.”

“I don't need high-end capabilities of which I can fire only one, against targets which will be attacking in hundreds,” he said.

Russia is using drones every night in Ukraine, because each drone is a “lottery ticket that always wins,” said Kusti Salm, a former top official at Estonia's Defense Ministry.

That's because a drone either hits something or, if Ukraine shoots it down with a missile, it drains Kyiv's air defenses and finances, since missiles are more expensive than drones, said Salm who now runs Frankenburg Technologies, a company developing low-cost anti-drone missiles.

Although NATO countries have a “very good understanding” of how to defend against conventional threats such as missiles and planes, they need to rapidly improve at dealing with drone threats, said Tomas Godliauskas, Lithuania's vice-minister of national defense.

When the Russian drones flew into Poland, NATO nations deployed fighter jets and attack helicopters and put missile defense systems on alert. But none of those options was specifically designed for drone warfare.

Although Russia and Ukraine have been firing more and more drones at each other, there has been less investment in counter-drone systems, Salm said. He suggested that's partly because it's easier to get a drone to fly than it is to develop something to detect or intercept it.

Slow, low-flying drones made from wood, fiberglass, plastic or polystyrene might not be detected by radar systems searching for a fast-moving missile made of metal, or they might look like birds or a plane. Enemy operatives can also bypass defenses by launching drones from inside a country, as Ukraine did to devastating effect when it attacked Russian airfields this year.

There are also other technological hurdles, including trying to jam the enemy's drones and communications without cutting your own, Merilo said.

In August, a Ukrainian drone — possibly sent off course by Russian electronic jamming — landed in a field in southeastern Estonia. It crashed because the military wasn't capable of detecting it, Merilo said.

The Estonian military and border force have also lost drones — used for surveillance and to stop illegal border crossings — to Russian jamming, which has also been blamed for disrupting flights.

Other drones have crashed in Romania, Moldova, Lithuania and Latvia, and there have been multiple unidentified drone sightings over military facilities and airports in Europe, including in Germany, the U.K., Norway and Denmark, where air traffic was halted for several hours at Copenhagen Airport on Monday.

The number of incidents shows that Europe needs to solve its drone problem “right now,” said Col. Māris Tūtins, head of information analysis and operations at Latvia's Joint Forces Headquarters.

There is growing support among European leaders for establishing some sort of drone wall along the EU's eastern border, though the 27-nation bloc in March denied funding to a joint Estonia-Lithuania proposal to establish one.

The EU needs to prioritize funding for the project, Pevkur said. But although support for the idea is growing, actually creating a drone defense system won't be easy.

“Drones are not mosquitoes,” the Estonian defense minister said, suggesting that they would be unlikely to be zapped by an “electronic wall” along NATO's borders.

There are many types of drones, including those used for intelligence and reconnaissance, that fly at high altitude, that are used in attacks or that even remain attached to a thin fiber-optic cable while flying, making them impossible to jam. Russia also uses decoy drones in Ukraine that carry no payload and are designed to exhaust air defenses. 

Any plan to defend against drones needs a multilayered approach, including sensors, “electronic warfare … also low-cost small missiles or attack drones,” Merilo said.

Although the need for better drone defenses isn't new, it's still largely only possible to buy systems that are “really expensive,” take a long time to develop and can't be mass-produced, Merilo said.

He suggested that's partly because big defense companies that have spent decades developing billion-dollar air defense systems might not want something new — and cheaper — on the market.

“We have to understand this game,” Merilo said, adding that some technology does exist, but “the question is who — and how fast they can start producing.” 

Facing nightly onslaughts, Ukraine is rapidly developing its own technology, including long-range attack drones and smaller ones for use on the front lines.

While big defense companies play a critical role in the defense of Europe, Latvia and some other NATO countries have turned to smaller companies — such as Salm's Frankenburg — to acquire its small anti-drone missiles once they're in production.

But a piecemeal approach isn't ideal, Salm said. Instead, the EU needs to invest more in European startups, which can turbocharge drone defense production that can be used by allies across different weapons systems, he said.

Europe needs to switch to “semi-wartime thinking” and foster greater collaboration between the military, government and defense industries to be able to fill its technology gap, Godliauskas said.

In Ukraine, it's sometimes only a matter of weeks between drone technology being developed and used on the battlefield. Europe “doesn't have time” to spend years waiting to acquire equipment, the Lithuanian official said. 

Another lesson from Ukraine is that what works today, might not work tomorrow, Godliauskas said.

While drone defense is critical now, it would be wrong to forget about everything else, Tūtins said. That's because Moscow is using “all means possible” to destabilize Europe, including hybrid warfare and cyberattacks, he said.

What if I told you 10 years ago that a presidential nominee who received more votes than any other woman in history and nearly won the presidency was relegated to the dustbin of history less than one year later?

Would that seem plausible? Well, it's happening before our eyes.

HARRIS WARNS DEMOCRATS AGAINST FIXATION ON MAMDANI: ‘NOT THE ONLY STAR'

Former Vice President Kamala Harris launched the book tour that nobody asked for on Tuesday. The title of her tome, 107 Days, chronicles what can be considered the worst presidential campaign of our lifetimes. Team Harris blew through $1.5 billion in cash, and then some, ending up in debt, and got zero return on investment by losing every swing state and the popular vote, while also surrendering control of the Senate. In the end, and this number is truly something, 89% of counties in the U.S. went more red than blue when compared to the 2020 election.

“This is the first book to begin in Chapter 11,” Fox News's Jimmy Failia joked this week on America's Newsroom.

As she often has done throughout her political career, Harris uses the book to do the same thing Hillary Clinton did for her loss, “What Happened,” in 2016: blame almost everyone but herself. And she's doing this while also laughably claiming that if she just had more time to campaign, the result would have been different.

Actually, it was quite the opposite: The more she spoke, the more she was seen, the more her poll numbers went in the wrong direction. Think back to late July and August 2024: Harris is installed as the Democratic nominee without one vote from the public after President Joe Biden is tossed aside by his own party following a horrific debate performance in late June.

But what did her team do for the first six weeks of the campaign? Not allow her to do even one sit-down interview, even in the most friendly confines of MSNBC, CNN, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, or The View. So it's a bit rich for Harris to lament not having more time to make her case to the electorate while allowing herself to be sidelined.

But her campaign likely knew what many of us already did: Outside of prepared remarks in a teleprompter, Harris is a human Chernobyl. She simply has no talent for thinking or speaking extemporaneously. And when she has tried to do so in the past, such as her first run for president in 2020, she dropped out before the first votes were cast in Iowa.

It is ironic that Harris's team has chosen The View for her first broadcast network interview for the book tour. It was here in October 2024 that her campaign essentially ended: Sunny Hostin asked her a T-ball question about what she would do differently than Biden.

“You know … there is not a thing that comes to mind,” she answered while looking skyward.

Game. Set. Match.

Here was Democratic strategist James Carville‘s reaction: “The country wants something different. And she's asked, as is so often the case, in a friendly audience, on The View, ‘How would you be different than Biden?' That's the one question that you exist to answer, all right? That is it. That's the money question. That's the one you want. That's the one that everybody wants to know the answer to. And you freeze! You literally freeze and say, ‘Well, I can't think of anything'”

Usually, a major book tour like this is used as a stepping stone to another campaign. But it's virtually impossible to see Harris running again. This isn't Ronald Reagan coming back in 1980 after falling just short of the nomination in '76. Her base is nonexistent. Most people who voted for Harris were voting against Trump.

A recent poll from Atlas Intel, the most accurate pollster of the 2024 election, has Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) easily on top when polling Democratic voters as to their preferred nominee at 37.6%. Harris, despite being vice president for four years and getting more than 75 million votes less than one year ago, is a distant second at 20.5%. Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg (12.1%), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) (10.8%), and Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) (3.6%) round out the top five.

Speaking of Walz, who did the Harris campaign no favors as her running mate, thanks to him lying about fighting in war zones and claiming he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square riots — he was in Nebraska — Harris says she was forced into choosing the goofy governor of Minnesota because America wasn't ready for a gay vice president in Pete Buttigieg.

As for her relationship with Biden, Harris claimed that she couldn't ask him not to run again before accusing him of being reckless by staying in. “It's Joe and Jill's decision,” she writes. “We all said that, like a mantra, as if we'd all been hypnotized. Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high. This wasn't a choice that should have been left to an individual's ego, an individual's ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.”

Again, this is all so phony. She knew what his cognitive state was and lied directly to the public about it. Here's what Harris said right after Biden's debate against Trump that ended his political career: “Joe Biden is extraordinarily strong.” She then said, with a straight face to Anderson Cooper on CNN that night, Biden had a “slow start” but a “strong finish,” an assessment that exactly zero other people came away with. “He got into a groove where it counted,” she later told MSNBC. “Our president showed that he will win the election.”

Uh-huh.

Harris is doing herself no favors with this book, and this already feels more like a revenge tour. How is Walz feeling today after hearing that he wasn't her first choice as her running mate? How do the Bidens feel about her calling them self-serving?

On Tuesday, she sat down with Michael Strahan on Good Morning America. And her answer to the question, “Do you think Biden could have run the country for four years?” was met with the ultimate incoherent word salad.

“My concern about him running for reelection was completely separate from his capacity to serve … which was consistent and never wavered.”

So, she thinks Biden couldn't campaign for a few months, but could run the country for another four years? How does this remotely make sense?

Harris's book will finish at No. 1 on the bestseller lists. She likely got a hefty advance from Simon & Schuster. On that front, the book is a success.

DESANTIS UNVEILS PLANS FOR TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY IN MIAMI

But given that she and her husband are already worth millions, this isn't about the money. It's about getting back into power again.

And thanks to napalming every remaining bridge to those who were once her allies, it's safe to say this will be the last we see of Harris on any major political stage again.

Decoding online “psychobabble” with a real therapist.

Joe Nucci, like many brand-new therapists, loved showing off his fancy new psychology vocabulary during grad school. All these diagnoses and concepts were exciting, Nucci says, and helped explain so much. But as he continued his schooling, he realized that applying those terms in everyday life could be perilous.

Some self-help creators online could use a bit of that wisdom. As the stigma surrounding mental health has waned over the last 10 years, an influx of well-meaning influencers and consumers looking to understand more about themselves may have bought into flattened descriptions of popular terms — like boundaries or narcissism — or have internalized simplistic ideas about their emotions. “I was noticing that not only was some of it just technically incorrect, but it was being explained or applied in a way that ultimately was harmful,” Nucci says. “If people were taking that advice too literally or without the important missing nuance, it could lead to decisions that would actually hurt mental health and not help it.”

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

So Nucci, a licensed psychotherapist in private practice with over 250,000 followers on Instagram, set out to dispel some of those myths — to correct the therapy-speak that has come to dominate mental health. In Psychobabble: Viral Mental Health Myths and the Truths to Set You Free, Nucci outlines over three dozen misconceptions that have rampantly circulated online. Here, he discusses seven of the most pervasive, how we got here, and how to fight back.

Over the last decade or so, Nucci has noticed discussions around diagnoses morph from “You have X disorder” and “You are so much more than a label” to “almost a personality feature,” he says. Diagnoses are best utilized to inform a treatment plan to promote better functioning, Nucci says. But when people wear their diagnoses like a label, it may become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Those with ADHD, for example, may run late because they are distracted, he explains. “With the right medication, with the right mindset shifts, with the right coaching and executive functioning training, you can actually minimize how often you run late and to the point where you're not running late any more than the typical person,” he says. But if you believe running late is an unchangeable facet of your personality, you may make the symptoms worse and close yourself off to improvement.

Instead of relying on one term to define yourself, Nucci suggests highlighting many of your qualities using a variety of words: creative, outgoing, scatterbrained at times. “We need to be using more language,” he says, “not less.”

Nucci takes issue with the term “people pleaser” because it isn't specific and could refer to any number of behaviors. “Are you going along with things and then elevating your sense of moral superiority?” he says. “Are you self-sacrificing for one reason or another?” Some people may just be more agreeable than others and take pleasure when deferring to loved ones.

So-called people pleasing becomes problematic when it's motivated by conflict aversion — you're afraid of upsetting a friend so you don't voice your opinion even when you want to. In his own life, Nucci has been working on standing his ground and trying not to assume others are mad at him — he's been open with friends and family about it. “People, overall, were really supportive,” he says.

Like many pop psychology-related concepts, the widely accepted definition of “love bombing” has shifted. Originally intended to refer to a manipulation tactic where love and affection are used to control another person, the understanding of love bombing tends to point to any relationship that's progressing quickly. “There are so many reasons why people move fast in dating,” Nucci says: lust, infatuation, falling for an idea of a person, confused expectations.

Just because someone has intense feelings early in a relationship doesn't necessarily mean they're attempting to manipulate their romantic partner.

Other popular mental health-related terms have also followed a similar trajectory: think about the social media posts you've seen referring to people as “toxic” or “narcissists.”

As for love bombing, just because someone has intense feelings early in a relationship doesn't necessarily mean they're attempting to manipulate their romantic partner. Nor does taking a pause to slow things down if you're considering whether to continue dating after the initial infatuation has worn off.

Inspired by a metaphor he often saw online — “A flower isn't doing well. Do you blame the flower, or do you blame the quality of the soil, the air, the sunlight?” — Nucci believes both systemic societal issues and personal autonomy play a role in mental health. Racism, sexism, discrimination, and any number of systemic issues have certainly impacted his patients, Nucci says, but it's important for mental health practitioners to remember their patients have agency, too.

Sometimes, repeatedly reminding people of all the ways the world is unfair may prevent them from seeing a way forward. “If you're on the really extreme end of prioritizing systemic justice,” Nucci says, “there's going to be situations in which you could actually do something as an individual. You don't want to be so rigid in that stance that you miss the easy wins of stuff you can do and stuff that you can work on.”

At the same time, it is important to acknowledge external forces you can't control. Being wholly committed to the idea that you can change your circumstances if you just work hard enough might only lead to burnout, exhaustion, and frustration. “You're not actually advancing towards the goals that you value,” Nucci says. “Is it adaptive of you to take a step back, to take a deep breath and look at your context, look at the system that you're in? Maybe that's your family, maybe that's your culture or country. … That can also be really, really healing.”

Becoming an amateur expert in mental health concepts doesn't equate with healing, Nucci says. In therapy, counselors typically begin by helping patients name their experiences, process them, and analyze them, he explains. “Sometimes, when people are able to articulate a cogent analysis, their symptoms go away — not always, but sometimes,” Nucci says. “At that point you want to stop analyzing, because if you continue, it quickly becomes obsessing, ruminating.”

In which case, learning more or digging deeper emotionally might not help. Instead, therapists could turn their approach to other forms of treatment, like cognitive behavioral therapy, which focuses on shifting thought patterns, or behavioral therapy, where you work on changing your actions. Suffice to say, endlessly trying to learn about mental health concepts and terminology online can also become counterproductive outside of a therapeutic environment.

Most people differ in how open and vulnerable they expect their romantic relationships to be. Some want their significant other to be extremely expressive and raw; others might not be comfortable divulging everything to their spouse. You shouldn't feel bad if you don't want to tell your partner what you'd tell your therapist. “The type of intimacy that you would give your therapist, the types of details, the types of stuff you would talk about, I would not necessarily recommend speaking to your partner that way,” Nucci says.

The same goes for your children. Just because you'd confide in a friend about trauma from your past doesn't mean it's necessarily appropriate to disclose that to your kids.

Vulnerability is important in close relationships, but it doesn't mean you have to be totally vulnerable with every person you meet. “Maybe only one person gets that vulnerability with you,” Nucci says. “Maybe it's your partner, maybe it's your therapist, maybe it's a friend.”

While therapists are certainly qualified to treat patients on their mental health journeys, they are not “wise sages” on all topics, Nucci says, especially love. Therapy can help you identify unhelpful patterns in relationships and give you skills to help fix them, but it won't replace the experience of actually dating.

“You've got to learn to put yourself back out there, and that's all any of us can do,” Nucci says. “If that's something you're struggling with, therapy can be a great intermediate support for you, but I think it's inaccurate to say that it will make you completely ready.”

            A man in his forties has been arrested in connection to a cyber attack that knocked out automatic check-in systems at some of Europe's busiest airports last week.
    


            The man, who was arrested in West Sussex, England, on Tuesday evening, was detained on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences, the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) said in a statement shared with CNN. He has been released on conditional bail.
    


            “Although this arrest is a positive step, the investigation into this incident is in its early stages and remains ongoing,” Paul Foster, head of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit, said in the statement,
    


            “Cybercrime is a persistent global threat that continues to cause significant disruption to the UK. Alongside our partners here and overseas, the NCA is committed to reducing that threat in order to protect the British public,” he added.
    


            Last Friday, aviation company Collins Aerospace was targeted in the cyber attack, sparking disruption for passengers who were set to depart from cities including London, Brussels, Berlin and Dublin.
    


            Brussels Airport used iPads and laptops to check passengers in online, while a passenger at Berlin Brandenburg Airport told Reuters that travelers were being given handwritten boarding passes.
    


            In a statement on Wednesday morning, Berlin's airport said disruption was continuing.
    


            “Given that check-in and boarding are still largely manual, longer processing times, delays, and cancellations by airlines may continue today despite the mobilization of all available resources,” the airport said, adding that it is working on “alternative solutions to minimize the impact” of the cyberattack on passengers.
    


            London's Heathrow said Wednesday that the majority of its flights are “operating as normal.” Brussels Airport said Tuesday that there may still be “limited disruption” to flights because of the cyberattack.

Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) is investigating a Virginia school following allegations that a school official “arranged and bankrolled abortions” without parental consent.

Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) directed the Virginia state police to look into the allegations last month.

“As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), I am committed to ensuring parents are empowered with timely access to information necessary to protect their children from the threat of serious harm,” Cassidy wrote. “If these reports are true, they represent a betrayal of Fairfax County parents and families and warrant comprehensive oversight by the HELP Committee to determine how this could have occurred and who must be held accountable.”

A school social worker allegedly helped a 17-year-old girl at Centreville High School to have an abortion, while another girl “fled” an abortion clinic in fear of having an abortion. Fairfax County Public Schools has been accused of hiding the allegations.

“As Chairman of the HELP Committee, I am determined to ensure that federal education funds arenot being misused in violation of the law and parents' rights to protect their children,” he wrote.

“Given the seriousness of the allegations and the potential that federal funds were used by school officials to pressure minor students into receiving covert abortions without parental consent, it is imperative for the Committee to determine whether any federal funds were misused and whether the Hyde Amendment or other relevant laws were violated,” he added.

A TIMELINE OF TRUMP AND EPSTEIN'S RELATIONSHIP, FROM FRIENDSHIP TO FALLOUT AND BEYOND

Cassidy is asking the FCPS superintendent several questions, including about the school system's reporting requirements and other issues involving abortions and student pregnancies.

He's asking for a response to his questions by Oct. 6.

An emotional monologue, a takedown of Trump, and a victory for individual action.

Our great national censorship nightmare is over — but only for about three-quarters of the ABC stations in America.

Jimmy Kimmel was back on the air Tuesday night after Disney, the parent company of ABC, reversed its decision last week to suspend his talk show over comments he made about MAGA supporters' response to the killing of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk. That initial pause came after increasing pressure from the Trump administration and two TV station groups — Nexstar and the conservative-leaning Sinclair — which said last week they would not air Kimmel's show.

Whether or not you like Kimmel, his show's return Tuesday night was a triumph for a few reasons. First, it was a victory for free speech: the return of a show that was taken off the airwaves in part because of oblique threats from the Trump-era Federal Communications Commission's leadership, and the rebuffing of what my colleague Zack Beauchamp has called a “climate of fear and censorship” in the wake of Kirk's death, championed by conservative activists.

Second, it was also a new kind of (partial) victory for liberals and their resistance efforts in the second Trump term.

Led by celebrities, podcasters, influencers, and the grassroots — as opposed to any institutions, corporations, billionaires, or political parties — it managed to get a major corporation to resist Trump and restore Kimmel, even though his show is only returning to about three-quarters of the ABC-affiliated TV stations in America.

While a variety of voices pushed back against this attempt at corporate censorship, Nexstar and Sinclair continued to boycott Kimmel's show last night — airing local news segments instead of Jimmy Kimmel Live! in the nearly 25 percent of local ABC affiliates across the country that they own. They don't show signs of reversing course yet. And it's not clear what mechanism — if any — Kimmel supporters have to influence either corporation to change its policy for now.

Tuesday night's monologue might end up being the moment Kimmel revived this new type of resistance — or it might get lost in another wave of Trump-induced news and scandal. It will surely be one of his best-rated shows. He came out swinging against Trump, his efforts to punish his critics, and the FCC's chief, Brendan Carr. Kimmel didn't directly apologize — and instead made an impassioned case for further Trump resistance, called in surprise guest (and Trump archenemy) Robert De Niro, and joked about Trump's physical appearance and the likelihood of an Epstein Files drop “to distract us from this now. … He tried his best to cancel me, instead he forced millions of people to watch the show. That backfired bigly.”

His case against Trump was simple. “The president of the United States made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs. Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods because he can't take a joke,” he said, holding back tears throughout the address. “A government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn't like is anti-American. There is some solidarity on that from the right and the left and those in the middle. Maybe the silver lining from this is we found one thing we can agree on, and maybe we'll even find another one.”

No less potently, Kimmel didn't identify as a liberal or a Democrat when attacking Trump, but as an American. Kimmel, who joked that he barely paid attention in school, said he never expected to be in his current position — fighting a war of principle against a would-be American despot — but that he was taught by comedians such as Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, and Howard Stern that censoring comedians is “un-American.” This was not a progressive or a liberal's cry of rage; Kimmel attacked Trump from the absolute dead-center.

Although Kimmel came out strong in his return, there are still other obstacles to reclaiming his former audience. Sinclair and Nexstar are continuing their boycott of his show, setting up a potential showdown with Disney and ABC in the coming days. Sinclair's position seems ideological — demanding Kimmel apologize to Kirk's family and make a “meaningful” contribution to Kirk's activist group Turning Point USA. Nexstar argues that Kimmel's speech was harmful — though the company has a deal merging with Tegna, another major station owner, pending before Trump's FCC.

Combined, their stations reach nearly a quarter of the American viewing public — meaning millions of Americans (in cities like Washington, DC, Nashville, Salt Lake City, Seattle, and St Louis) who might want to watch Kimmel's show simply can't turn on their televisions and do so (I, for one, had to watch his monologue on a clandestine TikTok livestream from my phone).

Kimmel noted much of this during his monologue — citing pressure on affiliates in cities to not air his show and the slippery slope it might create in the future: “Should the government be able to regulate which podcasts the cellphone companies and wifi providers are allowed to let you download to make sure they serve the public interest?” His studio audience responded with a resounding, “No!” Kimmel and the decision-makers at the Mickey Mouse company might be hoping the rest of the country will keep feeling this way — but who knows if this fracas will be remembered beyond being just one more Trump scandal.

As the first few months of the second Trump term have shown, other major companies, law firms, universities, and organizations have acquiesced in the face of confrontation with the president. And massive street protests have been absent.

That's part of what makes this moment of individual-led backlash seem so noteworthy — and one reason why it's not clear that it can be replicated. Kimmel raised this specter Tuesday night too, noting Trump's apparent desire to go after late-night comics specifically will probably continue.

“Somehow, [he was able to] squeeze Colbert out of CBS, then he turned his sights on me, and now he's openly rooting for NBC to fire Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers and the hundreds of Americans who work for their shows,” he said. “And I hope that if that happens, or if there's even any hint of that happening, you will be 10 times as loud as you were this week. We have to speak out against this. He is not stopping. And it's not just comedy. He's gunning for our journalists too.”

In the week or so that Kimmel was off the air, the strongest efforts to push back against Trump and conservative efforts to censor Kimmel did not come from corporations, the stock market, or a major political institution. Instead, it was primarily driven by “talent” — actors, comedians, podcasters, and other individuals with a built-in audience and a public platform.

It came from the hundreds of Hollywood movie stars, comedians, and other celebrities who signed open letters: one from the ACLU with more than 400 A-list signers, including De Niro, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, and Lin-Manuel Miranda; and another of more than 600 comedians, including Rosie O'Donnell, Kathy Griffin, and Chelsea Handler.

It was musicians like Sarah McLachlan, Jewel, and Olivia Rodrigo who backed out of promotional events and appearances for Disney-backed projects, and at least one TV writer who said they wouldn't work with Disney in protest. It was current and past Marvel stars posting critically about Disney and free speech to their followers (Marvel Studios is owned by Disney).

And it was other current or former late-night and TV show hosts like Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, Jimmy Fallon, David Letterman, and Seth Meyers that dedicated their monologues, segments of their shows, or in-person appearances over the last week to pillory Trump and the FCC, and to support Kimmel.

It was “a blatant assault on freedom of speech,” Colbert, whose own show is being scrapped under dubious circumstances, warned in his monologue last week. “We all see where this is going. … You can't go around firing somebody because you're fearful or trying to suck up to an authoritarian — a criminal — administration in the Oval Office,” Letterman warned at a festival appearance last week. “It is possible to stand up to this kind of bullying and censorship,” Meyers said to his own audience on Monday night.

Even some of the podcasters and new media stars that often sympathize with MAGA voiced concerns over the last week. “Manosphere” influencers like the comedians Andrew Schulz and Akaash Singh spent time on their show and on social media explaining why conservatives should be outraged. Meanwhile, media personalities at the sports and pop culture brand Barstool Sports debated each other on whether the suspension was, in fact, government censorship.

And though it took him some time to record an episode and he didn't call out Trump by name, Joe Rogan, probably the most vocal “free speech” defender of the podcasting world, ultimately criticized the FCC, too, and warned those cheering Kimmel's silencing that the same powers could be used on them in the future on Tuesday.

Individually, each of these statements, posts, and actions reached very different segments of the American public; in today's siloed media and information ecosystem, perhaps none of them share an audience. But combined, they helped to spur on a tidal wave of pressure and criticism on Disney, its leadership, and its bottom line. Many of these same celebrities helped to encourage grassroots cancellations and boycotts of Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions, as well as its theme parks — which seem to have actually caused some economic damage.

Kimmel referenced almost all of this during his opening monologue last night: He thanked his fellow comedians; he joked about the mass subscription cancellations; he thanked those “people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” including Rogan, Sen. Ted Cruz, and other conservative media voices. And he set himself up to be, if only for one night, Hollywood's Resistance leader.

Of course, Trump weighed in before Kimmel even started speaking with another threat: “I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative,” he posted on Truth Social.

In the meantime, Disney will continue to allow streaming subscribers to watch Kimmel on Hulu (whose price is about to get higher), even if Nexstar and Sinclair-run local affiliates maintain their refusal to play his show on their stations. And while ABC and Disney's brass may feel they deserve some credit for Kimmel's reinstatement — Kimmel thanked them for bringing him back and supporting his show over the years, though “unfortunately, and I think unjustly, this puts them at risk” — the extent of their willingness to fight Trump and a weaponized FCC remain open questions.

            Surrounding our solar system is a natural and enigmatic cosmic shield called the heliosphere — and a new mission has launched to help astronomers better understand it.
    


            Created by the solar wind, a constant flow of charged particles that stream away from the sun, the heliosphere acts as an enormous bubble that protects the planets in our solar system from cosmic radiation permeating the Milky Way, our home galaxy.
    


            In addition to Earth's protective magnetic field, the heliosphere plays a major role in why life is possible on our planet — and how it perhaps once existed on others such as Mars.
    


            Over half a dozen missions   have contributed to how astronomers understand the heliosphere, and two enduring spacecraft, the Voyager probes, have collected key data after exiting the heliosphere to explore interstellar space.
    


            But the new IMAP, or Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe, mission is designed to investigate how the sun forms its solar wind, and how that solar wind interacts with interstellar space at the boundary of the heliosphere, which begins at a range three times the distance between Earth and Pluto, according to NASA.
    


            The spacecraft's 10 instruments will also fill gaps in the existing map of the heliosphere, pieced together from data collected by previous missions, and help further explain how the heliosphere largely shields our solar system from damaging cosmic rays, the most highly energetic particles in the universe.
    


            Along with two other space weather missions that lifted off aboard the same rocket on Wednesday, IMAP will help scientists better predict when solar storms unleashed by the sun could affect our planet. When aimed at Earth, harsh radiation from the storms, also known as space weather, can pose risks to astronauts on the International Space Station as well as interfere with communications, the electric power grid, navigation, and radio and satellite operations.
    


            “This next set of missions is the ultimate cosmic carpool,” said Dr. Joe Westlake, director of NASA's Heliophysics Division, during a news conference on Sunday. “They will provide unprecedented insight into space weather. Every human on Earth, as well as nearly every system involved in space exploration and human needs, is affected by space weather.”
    


            The heliosphere was first theorized by multiple scientists investigating the concept of cosmic rays and the solar wind in the late 1950s, according to NASA. They believed the sun provided a web of magnetic fields and solar wind that created a boundary surrounding Earth and the rest of the solar system.
    


Mariner 2, the first successful mission to another planet that performed a flyby of Venus in 1962, also was the first to measure the solar wind, proving its existence. Direct measurements taken by the Pioneer 10 and 11 missions in the 1970s, as well as the Voyager probes, provided further proof of the heliosphere.
    


            Scientists are eager to know what the boundaries of the heliosphere look like, something that the Voyager probes have offered tantalizing glimpses of in the past. They are the only two spacecraft to cross the heliosphere.
    


            Voyager 1 reached the heliosphere boundary in 2012, while the slower Voyager 2 crossed the boundary in 2018, providing snapshots in two specific locations. The information collected by these probes is helping scientists learn about the heliosphere's cometlike shape.
    


            The IBEX, or Interstellar Boundary Explorer, satellite has been mapping the heliosphere since launching in 2008. But IMAP can explore and map the boundaries of the heliosphere like never before because it has instruments with faster imaging that are capable of 30 times higher resolution.
    


            Once it reaches an orbit about 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth in about three months, IMAP will also capture observations of the solar wind in real time and measure particles that travel from the sun, study the heliosphere's boundary between 6 billion and 9 billion miles (9.7 billion to 14.5 billion kilometers) away, and even collect data from interstellar space.
    


            Predominately, IMAP will measure energetic neutral atoms, called ENAs, or uncharged particles that form when an energetic charged ion collides with a slow-moving neutral atom. The process that forms these particles, found wherever there is plasma, or charged gas, in space, also occurs throughout the heliosphere and along its boundary. IMAP will rely on tracking these particles to create a more complete map of the heliosphere, according to NASA.
    


            The particles travel in a straight line, unaffected by magnetic fields because they are not charged, so IMAP can collect ENAs near Earth and trace them to their origins, like the otherwise invisible boundaries of the heliosphere, according to NASA.
    


            “IMAP is going to make incredibly detailed pictures that will evolve over time of that interaction region,” said Dr. David McComas, IMAP's principal investigator and an astrophysicist at Princeton University. “It will be able to understand what the shielding is, how the shielding works and what it looks like.”
    


            McComas added that our solar system is not alone in having something like a heliosphere, and bright astrospheres  have been spotted around other stars.
    


            IMAP launched alongside NASA's Carruthers Geocorona Observatory and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's SWFO-L1, or Space Weather Follow On-Lagrange 1, on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday at 7:30 a.m. ET. NASA streamed the launch live on YouTube.
    


            The Carruthers Geocorona Observatory is a small satellite that will be dedicated to observing the exosphere, or Earth's outermost atmospheric layer. The Carruthers mission will capture images of the region's faint ultraviolet glow, called the geocorona, to help answer questions about the exosphere's shape, size and density.
    


            The mission is named for Dr. George Carruthers, who developed an ultraviolet camera as the first moon-based observatory that was placed during the Apollo 16 mission. The camera, still in place in the Descartes highland region on the moon, photographed Earth in ultraviolet light and captured the first image of the exosphere in 1972.
    


            The Carruthers mission will measure changes and the effects of space weather once it reaches Earth, given that the exosphere marks a transitional boundary between Earth and space.
    


            Meanwhile, the SWFO-L1 mission is intended to act as a solar storm detector, providing early warnings to protect astronauts in low-Earth orbit and satellites that provide critical communications on Earth. It's a tool that will be even more necessary as astronauts venture farther into deep space.
    


            “I think we're getting better…but a really solid forecast, I think, is still something that we're striving for,” said Mark Clampin, acting deputy associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, at a news conference for the agency's upcoming Artemis II mission around the moon. “And obviously the missions that we're putting up now will give us much better insight into not just the one piece of the problem, but the whole problem, from what's happening on the sun to how that then propagates out from the sun, and whether it becomes a real problem or not.”
    


Two billionaires have very different — and equally wild — visions of a future in space. Is either possible?



            The satellite's compact coronagraph telescope will monitor the sun for activity and measure the solar wind, providing a constant stream of data to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. Images of solar storms taken by the satellite can be sent to the center within 30 minutes, while other current missions, like NASA and the European Space Agency's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, launched in 1995, can take up to eight hours.
    


            “SWFO-L1's essential data is our lifeline for keeping the lights on, planes flying and satellites safe, ensuring that America is ready for what the sun sends our way ,” said Clinton Wallace, director of NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center.

A new California law that bans federal immigration officers from wearing face masks in the state is unconstitutional and unenforceable, according to former law enforcement officials.

Over the weekend, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) signed five bills into law that aim at restraining the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement from arresting illegal immigrants across the West Coast state, a move that he said was meant to deter federal authorities from carrying out President Donald Trump's mass deportation operation.

Other laws included policies barring ICE from accessing schools and hospitals without a judicial warrant and requiring schools, colleges, and universities to alert parents when ICE is on campus.

One such law, SB 627, made it illegal for local police and sheriff's department employees, federal police, and state police from states other than California to wear face masks while working. California state police were exempt from the face mask ban.

The trouble for Newsom, according to several former police officials who spoke with the Washington Examiner on Tuesday, is that although the state could enforce this mask ban against its own local police and sheriff's deputies, it cannot dictate how federal police present themselves.

Jonathan Fahey, former acting ICE director, said going after federal police would violate the Constitution's Supremacy Clause because federal law is supreme.

“When a federal officer is acting within their official capacity and doing what they believe is … within the scope of their employment, they cannot be prosecuted, even if it in fact violated a state law,” said Fahey, now partner with the Holtzman Vogel law firm in Washington. “Everyone knows that [California] can't do this.”

Bill Johnson, executive director of a national police organization representing more than a quarter of a million officers, agreed with Fahey.

“It seems pretty clear from a constitutional perspective that any efforts by California to thwart federal law enforcement actions will fail under the federal constitution's Supremacy Clause,” said Johnson, who leads the National Association of Police Organizations. “No doubt the governor and his advisers are aware of this, but once again have chosen the cheap theatrics of another ill-advised state policy that will be quickly struck down.”

Brian R. Marvel, president of the Peace Officers Research Association of California, said the governor's plan would turn local police into a “punching bag to grandstand against the federal government” and said the organization's 83,000 officers opposed it.

Johnson added that the law “seems just like more of the same old song and dance” from California politicians.

“Instead of focusing on all the problems within California and failure after failure of their policies, the governor once again seeks to deflect attention by stoking anger against law-enforcement officers and agents,” Johnson said. “These proposals ignore the very real threats and attacks against law-enforcement officers and their families at all levels.”

Sgt. Betsy Brantner Smith, who spent nearly three decades at a large police department in the Chicago suburbs, said the California law was likely “ceremonial” and explained that face masks serve a purpose.

“We wear face coverings in certain situations to prevent us — the law enforcement officer — from being identified,” Smith said. “It could be, again, from the doxing. It can also be because those officers are working in some sort of undercover capacity, some sort of tactical capacity. For example, SWAT teams and tactical teams very often wear face coverings, again, to prevent them from being identified, not to be hiding from the public.”

ICE did not respond to a request for comment, but Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin stated, “We don't need to abide by this garbage.”

California police could run into their own legal trouble if they attempt to arrest ICE personnel when the ban takes effect on Jan. 1, 2026.

“If a state officer tried to arrest like an ICE agent for wearing a mask while they're out doing their job, the state officer would actually be arguably guilty of obstructing justice, and an ICE agent would be able to arrest the state officer who's trying to arrest them,” Fahey said.

A Department of Justice spokesperson would not comment on how the federal government would handle potential state enforcement of the mask ban, but did note in a statement sent Tuesday evening that “protecting the safety and security of our federal law enforcement officers, ridding our country of dangerous illegal aliens, will continue to be a top priority for this Administration.”

Newsom has led the Democratic effort to fight back against the Trump administration, accusing President Donald Trump of “authoritarian tendencies” and abusing his authority on numerous occasions. Fahey quipped that Newsom could be the one determined to be abusing power if he required California police to enforce the ICE mask ban.

“What could be more an abuse of power to sign a law that is clearly unconstitutional, which would give the states power that they don't have under the Constitution to enforce laws,” Fahey said. “So if they actually try to enact this, it's a complete abuse of power.”

Newsom's office did not respond to a request for comment.

NewsNation reached a major milestone on Sunday, outperforming CNN and MSNBC in total viewers and the key advertising demographic of adults aged 25-54 for six consecutive hours, the first time the network has achieved that feat, according to Nielsen data.

From 1 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. ET, the network averaged 615,000 viewers overall and 173,000 in the 25-54 demo. Coverage was anchored by Chief Washington Correspondent Leland Vittert and later by Nichole Berlie, who hosted a special edition of NewsNation Now. Programming included live coverage of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk's memorial service, followed by analysis and reaction.

The Sunday block marked NewsNation's highest-rated Sunday ever, far surpassing its normal averages. Viewership was up nearly 1,000% compared to the network's typical Sunday afternoon ratings. At its peak, around 3:57 p.m. ET, nearly 2 million people were watching, with 1.96 million total viewers recorded.

The surge gave NewsNation decisive wins over its competitors.

CNN averaged 342,000 viewers during the same period (54,000 in the demo), while MSNBC managed 287,000 viewers (31,000 demo).

The strong showing follows another victory the previous week, when NewsNation topped CNN and MSNBC in Saturday prime-time ratings. However, the six-hour stretch on Sunday was the first time the network has simultaneously outperformed both rivals for such a sustained duration in total viewership and the 25-54 demo.

While NewsNation celebrated a breakthrough, Fox News once again led cable news.

The network averaged 5.2 million viewers and 755,000 in the 25-54 demo during the same 1:30–7:15 p.m. ET window, according to Nielsen's Big Data Plus Panel. That accounted for nearly 90% of total cable news viewership. Fox's audience peaked during Erika Kirk's tribute at 6 p.m. ET hour, drawing 6.6 million total viewers and 1.1 million in the demo.

The memorial service ratings highlighted a shifting cable landscape: Fox News remains the undisputed leader, NewsNation is carving out new territory with record viewership, and CNN and MSNBC continue to slide further behind.

The National Football League's finance committee approved the sale of 2.35% of the Chicago Bears to existing owners of the team in a deal that sets a league record and values the Bears at $8.9 billion, according to three people familiar with the deal, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly. 

The deal closed several days ago, according to one of the people. Because the sale is to existing team owners, the league does not require the deal to be approved by three-fourths of the NFL's owners.

The Bears were valued at $6.4 billion just a year ago in CNBC's Official NFL Team Valuations — No. 10 among the league's 32 teams. The team rose to No. 7 in CNBC's 2025 valuations.

The stake of the Bears that was sold was held by the estate of Andrew McKenna, according to two people familiar with the deal. McKenna died in 2023. Galatioto Sports Partners represented the estate in the sale, said the people, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Two-thirds of the 2.3% sold will go to the McCaskey family and one-third will go to the Ryan family, leaving the former with about 77% ownership and the latter with about 23%, the people said.

Neither the NFL nor Galatioto Sports Partners responded to emailed questions from CNBC about the sale.

The previous record high valuation in the sale of a minority stake in an NFL team was $8.6 billion, in the purchase of a 6.2% stake of the San Francisco 49ers in May, according to a person familiar with the deal, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly. That topped the $8.3 billion valuation for an 8% stake in the Philadelphia Eagles at the end of 2024, CNBC previously reported. The New York Giants are currently looking to sell a 10% stake at about a $10 billion valuation, CNBC previously reported.

The Bears currently play at the obsolete Soldier Field, which was last renovated more than 20 years ago. The Chicago Park District gets some of the revenue from non-NFL events at the stadium. The team is exploring building a stadium in Arlington Heights, a suburb of Chicago. A fixed-roof domed stadium would give the Bears an opportunity to host non-NFL events year-round and get more non-NFL event revenue.

Valuations for the sale of limited partner stakes do not necessarily translate to control sale prices. Large LP stakes, say, above 20%, typically sell at discounts to control sale valuations because limited partners have no stake in how the team is run and the dollar amount to buy the stake is relatively large. In some cases, however, small LP stakes, say, below 10%, can sell at a premium to a control sale valuation because an LP stake may be the only opportunity a person has to own a piece of an NFL team due to skyrocketing valuations and the actual dollar amount required to buy such a stake is relatively small.

The last control sale of an NFL team was Josh Harris' purchase of the Washington Commanders for $6.05 billion in 2023, according to media reports.

Former FBI Director James Comey is expected to be indicted on criminal charges in the coming days in federal court in Virginia, MSNBC reported Wednesday.

The news comes days after the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia resigned under pressure from President Donald Trump after opposing the filing of charges against Comey.

Comey for years has been a target of Trump's ire. 

The president, in a social media post on Saturday, called Comey "guilty as hell" as he raged about the lack of criminal charges against the former FBI leader.

MSNBC reporter Ken Dilanian, in a post on X, said Comey is expected to be indicted in the Eastern District of Virginia, according to three people familiar with the matter.

"The full extent of the charges being prepared against Comey is unclear, but the sources believe that at least one element of the indictment — if it goes forward -- will accuse him of lying to Congress during his testimony on September 30, 2020 about whether he authorized a leak of information," Dilanian tweeted.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that day had asked Comey if he lied when he said he did not, as FBI director, authorize a leak of information to The Wall Street Journal for an October 2016 article about a Justice Department probe of then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's email use.

Dilanian, who reported Wednesday's story with his MSNBC colleague Carol Leonnig, noted that the five-year statute of limitations on that charge would lapse next Tuesday.

Cruz, in a December 2020 letter to the Justice Department, wrote that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe had admitted knowing about and authorizing the leak. 

Cruz wrote that while McCabe has insisted that Comey was aware of his decision to authorize the disclosure, Comey "has denied this claim."

In May 2017 testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Comey had said he "never" had been an anonymous source in news reports about probes involving Trump or Clinton, and that he had not authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source.

In his September 2020, testimony, Comey said he stood by that answer.

"Mr. Comey and Mr. McCabe's statements are irreconcilably contradictory," Cruz wrote to the Justice Department. "Mr. McCabe says that he told Mr. Comey of the leak and that Mr. Comey approved—effectively authorizing the leak after the fact. Mr. Comey, on the other hand, has said that he neither authorized the leak nor knew of Mr. McCabe's involvement."

"One of them is lying under oath—a federal crime," Cruz wrote.

CNBC has requested comment from Comey through his book publisher.

Trump, in a Truth Social post on Saturday that was aimed at Attorney General Pam Bondi, said that  Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-California, are "all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to get done."

"Then we almost put in a Democrat supported U.S. Attorney, in Virginia, with a really bad Republican past. A Woke RINO, who was never going to do his job," Trump wrote, referring to acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Erik Siebert, who resigned Friday.

"That's why two of the worst Dem Senators PUSHED him so hard. He even lied to the media and said he quit, and that we had no case," wrote, Trump, who had put Sierbert into the job.

"No, I fired him, and there is a GREAT CASE, and many lawyers, and legal pundits, say so. Lindsey Halligan is a really good lawyer, and likes you, a lot. We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!! President DJT."

Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee in the race for mayor of New York City, said Wednesday that he has received at least seven calls from "emissaries" of wealthy people who have repeatedly offered him money to end his campaign.

Sliwa slammed those offers as "unethical and illegal."

And he warned that if he receives one more such offer, he will begin revealing names of the wealthy New Yorkers who have made them, NBC affiliate WNBC reported.

Sliwa reiterated his vow not to suspend his campaign. 

"Cross my heart and hope to die," the Guardian Angels founder told WNBC when asked if he plans to stay in the race until Election Day, Nov. 4.

President Donald Trump has suggested that Sliwa and Mayor Eric Adams drop out of the race to clear the way for a one-on-one match-up between former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the Democratic nominee, Zohran Mamdani.

"I would say that Cuomo might have a chance of winning if it was a one-on-one," said Trump, who has called Mamdani a "communist."

Mamdani is a self-described democratic socialist.

Adams and Cuomo are both Democrats, but are running as independents.

Recent polls show Mamdani comfortably leading Cuomo, with Adams and Sliwa trailing by a wide margin.

Shanaz Hemmati, a veteran of two multibillion-dollar startups, says any prospective entrepreneur needs to remember one key lesson before launching a new business.

No matter how confident you are in your business idea, seek out as many prospective customers or clients as you can and get their feedback before you commit to a business model, she says.

Hemmati and Ross Buhrdorf are the co-founders of ZenBusiness, which makes artificial intelligence software aimed at helping first-time entrepreneurs navigate the regulatory processes of starting a small business. They launched the business in 2017, and it was most recently valued at $1.7 billion in November 2021, according to the company.

The pair previously worked together as executives at vacation rental marketplace HomeAway, which Expedia acquired for $3.9 billion in 2015.

When they teamed up to start ZenBusiness, they spent roughly 10 months researching their industry and talking to dozens of entrepreneurs about their businesses' biggest pain points around legal compliance, says Hemmati, 62.

"When you have an idea, you already have identified a pain point you want to solve for," she says. The next step is figuring out how to solve it, she says, but you shouldn't jump to that stage too quickly, or without first conducting necessary research.

Hemmati says she and Buhrdorf knew they wanted to build an AI-powered software that helped small businesses manage and file legal documents. They had already witnessed the issue firsthand working at a startup and also found public data that showed it to be a widespread obstacle for entrepreneurs across the country, Hemmati adds.

They initially planned on marketing the service only to existing businesses, but talking to prospective clients made them realize that they should instead target first-time business owners who've never navigated a "pretty complex" legal process before, she says.

"We spoke with roughly 50 to 100 prospective customers to understand what they needed most — everything from formation help to ongoing compliance and growth services," she says. "We ran design sprints, tested different packages and pricing, even built websites and refunded early sign-ups just to see what caught people's attention and what they were willing to pay for."

DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own boss

That strategy proved invaluable, giving Hemmati and Buhrdorf "incredible insight and the confidence to launch," she adds.

Working with those business owners from the start also meant those clients would be more likely to keep using ZenBusiness' software as their companies grew, Hemmati says. ZenBusiness has now worked with at least 850,000 small businesses, according to the company.

The takeaway for other prospective entrepreneurs, she says: Any business idea needs to be properly vetted, and the first step is always researching your market and talking to the customers and clients you want the business to reach.

"[Start] by having that communication and collaboration, constantly interviewing your potential customers and learning about what is the next product that they're interested in, and how you should even go about building it," Hemmati says.

Steve Blank, an author and serial entrepreneur who teaches a course on the subject at Stanford University, similarly says that a failure to properly research your potential customers before building a business model is a "fatal mistake" that will likely doom any new business before it even launches.

"The most important [question] is: 'Well, who are my customers?' And the second one is: 'What do they want?'" Blank told CNBC Make It in March. "It's not: 'Here's what I'm building. Can I sell it to someone?'"

As important as it is to seek out that feedback, though, it can only help entrepreneurs who are actually open to new perspectives and willing to adapt.

"If you can't pivot or pivot quickly, chances are you will fail," Blank wrote in a 2010 blog post.

Hemmati agrees: "There is a huge difference between those who have a mindset of exactly how they want to do [something], versus those who are truly open and think through [their options]," she says, adding that, ultimately, that mindset can be the difference between success and failure.

Honda is the latest automaker to roll back plans for an electric vehicle, citing "market conditions."

The company is ending its US production of the Acura ZDX electric crossover that General Motors was producing at a plant in Tennessee, spokespeople for both brands confirmed to Business Insider. The vehicle was only sold in the U.S. and Canada.

A spokesperson for Honda said in an emailed statement that the decision was made "to better align our product portfolio with the needs of our customers and market conditions."

"ZDX has played a valuable role for the Acura brand, and will provide a foundation we will build on next year with the arrival of the all-electric Acura RSX, which will be produced at the EV Hub in Ohio in the second half of 2026, as well as with hybrid-electric Acura models now in development," the statement continued. CNBC first reported the news.

Honda has sold more than 19,000 ZDXs in North America since the vehicle launched in May of 2024, the spokesperson said. In May of this year, Honda's CEO said the company would cut its EV investment by 30% through the 2031 fiscal year, partly due to "a slowdown in EV market expansion."

Compared to the rest of the world, EV sales in North America are slumping — in the first four months of this year, sales rose just 5%, compared to 25% in Europe and 35% in China, per data from EV research firm Rho Motion.

A $7,500 tax credit for buying an EV in the US ends on September 30 as part of President Donald Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill." Despite a more general slowdown, EV sales surged in August as people raced to take advantage of the credit.

Other automakers have also rolled back plans for EVs in recent years and focused more on internal combustion engines, which power gasoline vehicles. Hertz, for example, paused plans to buy 65,000 EVs last year. Ford canceled plans for electric three-row SUVs, though it recently announced plans for an EV truck.

Just days ago, the CEO of luxury carmaker Bentley said that it will continue to invest in combustion engines, after previously saying it wanted to build only electric vehicles by 2035. He cited a "dip in demand for luxury electric vehicles."

You probably don't who Wang Laisheng is.

He's a billionaire, but he doesn't have that top-level name-brand recognition like a Musk or Bezos. He's not snatching headlines every day.

Even if you're unfamiliar, chances are you've used one of his products. In fact, you're probably using one right now.

Wang is the cofounder and vice chairman of Luxshare Precision Industry, a China-based manufacturer that originally made cables and accessories for Apple products before getting the bump up to start assembling the company's golden goose: phones.

He's had a great week in the market, with his fortune jumping significantly in the days since the launch of the iPhone 17 — a period that's seen Luxshare stock spike 32%. Shares are listed on China's Shenzhen Stock Exchange, and the company is reportedly eyeing a Hong Kong listing this year.

According to Forbes data, Wang's net worth is now $14.3 billion. That's up from $9 billion as of last Thursday's close, before the iPhone 17 launch. He added $788 million to his net worth on Wednesday alone as Luxshare stock rose another 7%.

Luxshare was asked by Apple last week to boost its daily production of the iPhone 17 by around 40%, according to a report from The Information on Sept. 19, the same day the new iPhone went on sale. This added to the positive momentum of the product launch.

Another bullish driver has materialized over the same timeframe, with The Information also reporting that Luxshare signed a deal with OpenAI to produce a consumer AI device.

Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steven Tseng sees this as a positive sign for the long-term health of Luxshare, saying it "could be a fresh, long-term growth driver and diversify the company's revenue stream beyond Apple."

Moral of the story: if you do a job well for Apple, then other tech titans will eventually come knocking. And if Luxshare continues growing as expected, so will Wang's wealth.

UniQure's experimental gene therapy for Huntington's disease slowed progression of the brain disorder by 75% in an early-to-mid stage study, it said on Wednesday.

Shares of the company more than tripled in midday trading, skyrocketing 250%.

Huntington's is a rare inherited brain disorder, which steadily worsens and typically leads to death 10 to 30 years after symptoms begin. There are no FDA-approved treatments for the condition.

UniQure's therapy, called AMT-130, reduced disease progression by 75% at 36 months in patients who received a high dose, based on a widely used clinical scale.

It also slowed decline of functional abilities in patients by 60%, a key secondary goal of the trial.

"These groundbreaking data are the most convincing in the field to date and underscore potential disease-modifying effects in Huntington's disease, where an urgent need persists," said Sarah Tabrizi, director of the University College London's Huntington's Disease Center.

AMT-130 was generally well-tolerated, with no new serious side effects reported since late 2022, the company said.

UniQure plans to submit a marketing application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in early 2026, with hopes of launching the therapy later that year if approved.

About 41,000 people in the U.S. are living with the disease, and more than 200,000 are at risk of inheriting it, according to Huntington's disease Society of America.

Microsoft is the lead investor in OpenAI and has long been the artificial intelligence startup's key cloud partner. But in the latest sign that AI relationships are getting complicated, Microsoft is beginning to use more technology from OpenAI rival Anthropic.

The software giant said Wednesday that it's starting to draw on an AI model from Anthropic to answer some queries in the Microsoft 365 Copilot assistant for commercial clients.

The effort represents another step toward diversification in generative AI for Microsoft, which has mainly relied on OpenAI models for artificial intelligence features in Bing, Windows and other products. As part of a strategic partnership, Microsoft has invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI, and OpenAI operates its models in the Azure cloud, among other places.

OpenAI has been busy expanding its roster of high-powered partners. In recent weeks, the company has disclosed that it plans to spend $300 billion with Oracle, and it's forged a $10 billion agreement with chip designer Broadcom. This week, chipmaker Nvidia said it will invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a joint effort to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on new data centers.

Microsoft and OpenAI remain close, but their arrangement is changing.

Last year, Microsoft said it was allowing software engineers to get coding help from Anthropic and Google models in the GitHub Copilot Chat assistant, and not just from OpenAI. Anthropic, founded in 2021 by former OpenAI executives, was recently valued by investors at $183 billion. Microsoft remains the exclusive cloud supplier for OpenAI's programming interface that third-party applications rely on.

Anthropic's model is coming first to Researcher, an agent for Microsoft 365 Copilot that can gather and analyze information and generate reports.

Employees at organizations enrolled in Microsoft's Frontier program, which provides early access to AI features, can now choose to use Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.1 reasoning model, a type of model that's designed to break down complex tasks, as an alternative to OpenAI's competitive offering in Researcher.

"And stay tuned: Anthropic models will bring even more powerful experiences to Microsoft 365 Copilot," Charles Lamanna, Microsoft's president of business and industry Copilot, wrote in a blog post.

Corporate users can now opt to tap Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Opus 4.1 when building their own AI agents with Microsoft's Copilot Studio tool.

Administrators must enable Anthropic models before employees can use them. The models run in the Amazon and Google clouds. Their use is subject to Anthropic's terms and conditions, Lamanna wrote.

In addition to incorporating large language models from more companies, Microsoft has started testing MAI-1-preview, which it built in-house.

"As AI becomes more capable and agentic, models themselves become more of a commodity," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in an October LinkedIn post.

Last year, Microsoft identified OpenAI and Anthropic as competitors in AI products.

The Information reported on Microsoft's Copilot plans with Anthropic earlier in September.

Copilot is key to Microsoft's AI strategy.

"It continues to be rolled out among enterprises in phases," analysts at KeyBanc wrote in a July note to clients. The analysts, who recommend holding the stock, wrote that based on an "industry check," about 60% of customers are "implementing Copilot for just 10% of their 365 user base," and just 4% roll it out for every user.

A trusted market gauge has surged to its highest levels since the dot-com bubble, signaling stocks are the most expensive in 25 years.

The Shiller P/E ratio, also known as the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, compares the current value of a stock index like the S&P 500 to its average, inflation-adjusted earnings over the last 10 years.

The S&P's Shiller P/E ratio crossed 40 on Monday for the first time since 2000, when it reached a record 44. That spike preceded a 49% crash for the benchmark stock index between March 2000 and October 2002 as the internet boom collapsed.

"The US equity market looks expensive relative to its history, pretty much any way you slice it," Russ Mould, AJ Bell's investment director, told Business Insider by email.

He added that the Shiller P/E and several other valuation measures are "all in the top 10% of their historic ranges."

Mould said that "valuation does not guarantee an imminent accident," but investors might want to take precautions, in part because US stock returns have been "modest to disappointing" when they've traded at "similar Shiller P/E multiples to those in evidence now."

He added, "The tricky bit is 10 years is a long time and you don't know when trouble is going to strike!"

The Shiller P/E ratio was developed by Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller, who predicted the dot-com bubble would burst in "Irrational Exuberance," published just as the market peaked in March 2000.

He correctly warned the housing boom could collapse in the book's second edition, published in 2005.

Investors use the traditional P/E ratio to value a company's stock based on its earnings multiple, or how many times higher its price is than its earnings per share, or EPS, in a year. They calculate it by dividing a stock price by an annual EPS figure, either historical or projected.

Similarly, the Shiller P/E ratio takes a stock index's point value and divides it by the combined EPS of its constituent companies over the last 10 years, adjusted for inflation and divided by 10 to get a real, average figure.

So if the S&P 500 is at 6,700 points, and its average, inflation-adjusted EPS over the last 10 years is $167, dividing one by the other yields a multiple of 40.

The ratio can smooth out the effects of business cycles on profits by factoring in a decade's worth of earnings, providing a longer-term perspective on market valuation than the conventional P/E ratio.

The Shiller P/E ratio doesn't indicate an imminent crash, as markets can remain overvalued or undervalued for years.

It also doesn't account for interest rates, index composition, economic shifts, and corporate profitability, which can vary between time periods and influence valuations.

The S&P 500 has doubled in five years to trade at record highs, led by AI stocks such as Nvidia, which has soared almost 14-fold to become the world's most valuable public company with a $4.3 trillion market capitalization.

Several commentators have flagged that stocks are pricey. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a Tuesday speech that "equity prices are fairly highly valued."

Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, told Business Insider in August that the huge market values and vast shareholder bases of AI companies like Microsoft and Meta meant "more investors will suffer than suffered in the dot-com crash, and their suffering will be more painful."

But "Shark Tank" investor Kevin O'Leary and tech investor Ross Gerber dismissed the comparison between the AI boom and the dot-com bubble in separate interviews with Business Insider.

O'Leary said in August that the AI boom isn't like the dot-com bubble because "you actually can see the productivity and measure it on a dollar-by-dollar basis."

Gerber said that valuations are justified because AI companies promise tremendous growth and their profitability is "just insane."

Cloudflare unveiled a new policy framework designed to give website owners, publishers, and content creators greater control over how AI systems access and use their content.

The policy, called the Content Signals Policy, creates a potentially powerful new license for the web that targets Google's AI-powered search offerings, in particular.

The web is making a pivotal shift from traditional search engines to AI-powered answer engines that create responses directly from scraped content, often without linking back to original sources. This threatens the web's original traffic-driven model, which rewards content creation with clicks, views, and revenue.

Most AI companies, including OpenAI, have separate web crawling bots for search services and AI offerings. In contrast, Google's main search bot collects data from websites to feed both traditional search results and new AI-powered answer engines, including AI Overviews.

Cloudflare's new bot policy and license target Google's data-scraping advantage and seek to even the playing field, said CEO Matthew Prince.

"Every AI answer engine should have to play by the same rules," he told Business Insider. "Google combines its crawler for search with its AI answer engines, which gives them a unique and unfair advantage. We are making clear that there are now different rules for search and AI answer engines."

The Content Signals Policy, announced on Wednesday, builds on the company's existing web crawling bot management service, with new signals specifically aimed at AI crawlers and data scrapers.

Websites use a standard called robots.txt to control how bots access their data. This system was established at the dawn of the web. Now, the boom in AI bot scraping is putting pressure on it. Essentially, it's a gentlemen's agreement, and some AI companies ignore these website preferences and still crawl sites for data because their thirst for it is so strong.

More than 3.8 million domains already use Cloudflare's robots.txt service. Cloudflare is introducing what is essentially a new license for websites to help them explicitly block or allow AI bot crawlers in nuanced and more powerful ways.

Prince said this license could carry legal weight, especially for Google.

"Google's legal team will see this for what it is — a contract with legal ramifications if they ignore it," Prince said.

Prince added that Cloudflare helps run about 20% of the web, so this new license will be applied automatically to millions of websites on Wednesday.

That sets up a choice for Google, Prince said. The tech giant can either stop crawling these sites for its search engine, which would mean missing out on a large chunk of web content. Or, Google could comply and separate its bot crawlers, having one for traditional search and one for AI answer engines, Prince said.

Cloudflare specifically mentioned Google's AI Overviews in its announcement on Wednesday, saying these new settings will let websites block bots that collect data for AI Overviews and "inference," or how AI models draw conclusions and create outputs from data.

"The internet cannot wait for a solution while in the meantime, creators' original content is used for profit by other companies," Prince said.

Google has said that its new AI-powered search features still send traffic to websites and may even send higher-quality traffic. The company's executives have also stressed that they care deeply about the health and vibrancy of the web.

Prince said that OpenAI is being more responsible here by separating out its crawling bots, having one for its core AI operations and another for search functions.

Cloudflare's new tool allows creators to clearly express preferences about how their content may be used, choosing either "Yes" content can be used or "No" content should not be used.

More importantly, the policy distinguishes between different AI-related uses, including search, AI input, and AI training, and it reminds crawlers that robots.txt declarations can carry "legal significance."

A search preference would tell bot crawlers that a site's content can only be scraped for use in traditional search engines that send users to the original source of the information.

The AI input preference covers increasingly common situations where AI chatbots and AI models roam the web and collect website data for immediate summarization and inclusion in AI outputs.

The third preference, AI training, would allow websites to block AI bots that scrape data for use in the initial pre-training process, in which AI models are trained to understand the world in broad and powerful ways.

"To ensure the web remains open and thriving, we're giving website owners a better way to express how companies are allowed to use their content," Prince said. "Robots.txt is an underutilized resource that we can help strengthen and make it clear to AI companies that they can no longer ignore a content creator's preferences."

Amazon's AI coding assistant Q Developer saw revenue fall behind rivals in its first year, prompting the company to reassess its broader branding plans, Business Insider has learned.

As of late April, a full year since its launch, Q Developer's projected annual recurring revenue was $16.3 million, according to an internal document obtained by BI. The forecast was based on roughly $317,000 in weekly revenue and $1.25 million over the trailing 4-week period.

ARR is a common industry metric that extrapolates weekly or monthly revenue streams into an annualized figure.

Q Developer's growth might have stood out in earlier years, but it looks modest in today's rapidly accelerating AI industry, according to Jason Lemkin, managing director of SaaStr Fund.

For instance, Anysphere's Cursor coding tool crossed $500 million in ARR in June after reaching $100 million earlier this year. Another popular AI coding assistant Windsurf reported $82 million in ARR in July, less than a year into its launch. Even younger AI startups like Gamma and Higgsfield hit $50 million in ARR in less than a year, underscoring Q Developer's comparatively slower growth, Lemkin said.

"It's not as jaw-dropping as it used to be," Lemkin told BI, referring to Q Developer's growth. "AWS has fallen behind in the AI race."

An Amazon spokesperson wrote in an email that it is "continuing to innovate rapidly" to grow Q, with firms including ADP, Deloitte, and Japan Research Institute among active users.

"We're extremely pleased with the accelerating growth of Amazon Q, where daily usage of Q Developer has increased 9-fold per person this year," the spokesperson added.

Q is a key AI product category for Amazon, akin to Microsoft's Copilot. Q Developer is a AI coding assistant for developers, while Q Business is an AI chatbot targeting general business users.

But Q has yet to gain widespread recognition, and Amazon is now looking to refine the Q branding, according to several Amazon employees who spoke to BI. These people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.

Q Business is also undergoing a major revamp with the forthcoming Quick Suite, BI previously reported.

Several Amazon employees told BI that AWS lacks a strong reputation for AI-powered developer tools. They said generative AI took AWS by surprise, leading the company to rush new products without comprehensive feature sets.

Amazon's spokesperson told BI that Q Developer continues to receive positive feedback from customers, and it is the most widely used internal tool at the company.

"We are seeing more and more customers, from startups to large enterprises, adopt Q Developer to make their teams more productive," the spokesperson said.

For Amazon, the AI coding market is too big to walk away from. Gartner projects that by 2028, 40% of new business software will be built with such tools.

Yet even inside Amazon, employees appear to favor external products like Cursor over Q Developer.

Internal Slack messages reviewed by BI earlier this year showed that Amazon was planning to deploy Cursor internally after strong employee demand. In one message, an employee wrote that Cursor can make "almost instantaneous" changes, while Q Developer takes "minutes."

Even Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has taken note. He previously said Q Developer saved Amazon "4,500 developer years of work" and an estimated $260 million in "annualized efficiency gains." On May's earnings call, however, he pointed to Cursor, an AWS cloud customer, as a major force behind the "explosion of coding agents."

Silicon Valley isn't the only industry reeling from President Donald Trump's plans to charge companies hiring skilled foreign workers $100,000 for visas.

Wall Street banks and other financial firms have long used the H-1B visa program to fill an array of roles, from computer programmers to traders and even investment bankers.Trump's executive order, signed late Friday, "caught everyone off guard," JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said on CNBC while in Mumbai, India, this week.

In order to visualize the potential impact on the financial industry, Business Insider turned to publicly available data from the Department of Labor and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The data covers H-1B application data for the first three quarters of the government fiscal year 2025, as well as the less-common H-1B1 and E-3 visas, from October of 2024 to the end of June this year.

We studied certified visa applications during this time period to highlight the biggest financial industry users of the visa program. The data does not reflect the total number of H-1B employees at any given firm, but it provides helpful context on immigrant labor demands.

The data shows that some of the largest financial employers heavily rely on this visa to fill a range of roles, especially technology roles. Major banks like Chase and Goldman Sachs dominate the list alongside major payments companies like American Express. Asset managers like BlackRock and Vanguard, and research and ratings agency Moody's, help to round it out.

Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Citigroup declined to comment. The others did not respond to a request for comment from BI.

Certified applications: 2,440

Employees worldwide: 317,160 as of the second quarter of 2025

The country's largest bank focused its H-1B hiring heavily on technologists, with more than 500 certified applications for vice president, lead software engineer, and associate software engineer III positions. The bank also filed visa applications for the firm's main business lines, such as an investment banking managing director.

Certified applications: 1,575

Employees worldwide: Over 78,000 per its website

Fidelity submitted a wide range of applications for technical roles, with 40 certified applications for full-stack engineering directors and 125 for full-stack engineering principals. Non-technical roles included a director of marketing.

Certified applications: 1,280

Employees worldwide: 45,900 as of the second quarter of 2025

Not all of Goldman Sachs' certified applications specified the role, focusing instead on the level of hire, such as an associate. The data, however, does show a wide range of technologist hires and financial hires, including many vice president-level banking roles.

Certified applications: 921

Employees worldwide: 75,100 as of the end of 2024

American Express's certified applications were largely for technologist roles, with more than 125 for"engineer" roles. Business Insider also found applications for non-technical roles, including director-level applications for risk management, communications, and controller.

Certified applications: 874

Employees worldwide: 229,000 as of the end of 2024

Citi's certified applications also largely focused on technology roles, including more than 150 certified applications for "Application Development Technical Lead Analyst" roles.

Certified applications: 871

Employees worldwide: 76,500 as of the second quarter of 2025

Like others on this list, Capital One's certified applications largely focused on technology and data roles. The data showed hundreds of applications for data science and analysis roles, as well as some less technical roles like "business manager."

Certified applications: 770

Employees worldwide: 31,600 as of the end of 2024

Visa is yet another company largely focused on tech and data hires. Some non-technical roles include compensation business analysts, senior financial analysts, and managers.

Certified applications: 718

Employees worldwide: 213,000 as of the second quarter of 2025

Bank of America also focused its applications on tech hiring. Their most common role on the list, a vice president-level software engineer III, could be found on over 100 applications.

Certified applications: 673

Employees worldwide: 80,000 as of the first quarter of 2025

Morgan Stanley's data only showed the level of roles it was hiring for, so we cannot analyze what kinds of jobs its looking to fill. However, we can see that they have applied for vice president-level roles the most, followed by associates and then directors.

Certified applications: 624

Employees worldwide: More than 70,000 per their company website

US Bank is yet another bank that largely uses H-1B visas for for technology roles, such as senior software engineer. There are other financial roles though, like tax accountant, underwriter, and project manager for the firm's impact finance, focused on affordable housing.

Certified applications: 457

Employees worldwide: 92,900 as of the end of 2024

The British bank's US visa hiring is also largely focused on technology. Some front-office hires included an equities derivatives trader and an equities "exotic" trader.

Certified applications: 434

Employees worldwide: 32,600 per the firm's website

Charles Schwab is also using H-1B visa to hire tech talent, with the data showing nearly 50 software development and engineering senior manager roles and nearly 100 software development and engineering manager hires. We were unable to find a single role that didn't appear to be related to technology.

Certified applications: 391

Employees worldwide: 217,000 at the end of 2024

Wells Fargo joins the ranks of financial firms largely focused on technological hires in its H-1B visa applications. The data also showed certified applications for roles like lead securities trader and strategy and planning director.

Certified applications: 339

Employees worldwide: 110,323 as of the end of 2024

UBS had certified applications for a slew of tech and financial roles. On the financial side, it has applied for roles like investment banking analyst and associate, the entry-level role to a banking career, as well as an associate director of global markets FX trading.

Business Insider Edition 

Eswatini recently disclosed that it had repatriated a Jamaican native who had been sent to the Southern African country from the United States under the Donald Trump third-country immigration policy.


        In July, the U.S deported five third-country nationals to Eswatini as part of its campaign against illegal immigration.
    


        Orville Isaac Etoria, a Jamaican who was part of the group, has now been sent back to his home country, according to a statement by the Eswatini government.

        The statement added that Mr. Etoria, 62, was "warmly welcomed by members of his family" following his voluntary repatriation over the course of the weekend.
    


        "Mr Etoria has safely returned to Jamaica, where he was warmly welcomed by members of his family," said the Eswatini government statement issued on Monday.
    


        The Legal Aid Society of New York, however, has reproved his treatment, claiming that Etoria entered the US as a minor and maintained legitimate permanent residency status there for many years.
    


        The rest of the deportees to the small Southern African country, originally from Cuba, Laos, Vietnam, and Yemen, are still being held there.
    


        As seen on the BBC, these men are being detained in solitary confinement in a maximum security prison in the capital city, Mbabane, after being described as ‘depraved monsters' by the U.S government.
    


        Originally, the country stated that the deportees were being kept in separate jail facilities pending repatriation procedures.
    


        The legal representatives for the four deportees still in Eswatini claim they have been unable to get in touch with them.
    


        But Eswatini disclosed that it is working to repatriate them all.
    


        In July, a deportation flight carrying immigrants from Yemen, Cuba, Laos, Vietnam, and Jamaica landed in Eswatini.
    


        The flight had been authorized by the US Department of Homeland Security under the revised regulation that allows illegal migrants to be deported to countries other than their home of origin.

        The Trump administration was able to continue deporting migrants without providing them an opportunity to prove that they were being persecuted or injured because of a June ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court.
    


        U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin described five of the deported individuals as "depraved monsters" in a tweet on X.

The arena of late-night comedy is a cutthroat one, with warring timeslots and competing comedians jockeying for a slice of the viewership pie. But when one of their own is threatened, the pack rises to the occasion.

We saw that this week when "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" got hit with a suspension from ABC following his comments on the killing of the conservative podcaster Charlie Kirk. And that happened, too, when "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" was scheduled for cancellation.

For a hot minute this week, when ABC appeared to cave to pressure from the chair of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, President Donald Trump looked to be gaining ground in his war on late-night comedy. The president hasn't been shy about how much talk-show hosts and comedians annoy him. He has called them talentless and urged their networks to fire them.

Yet they're still here — for now — and they won't shut up.

Jon Stewart, the longtime late-night great, approached the Kimmel issue head-on in two monologues in the past week. On Thursday's episode of 'The Daily Show," he put on a satire-laden dedication to America's "great leader" Trump, blasting the administration's stance on free speech.

And on Monday, Stewart went all-in with his commentary on Trump. In his monologue, he joked about the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, an ongoing PR nightmare for the Trump administration. Then he issued a rallying call for people to "fight like hell" to defend "our constitutional republic," a signal that the work is far from done regardless of Kimmel's return.

On John Oliver's Sunday episode of "Last Week Tonight," he acknowledged that he isn't bound to some of the limitations his fellow network-based comedians are because HBO airs his show. The British-born comedian took advantage of that freedom to deliver a half-hour dissection of the Kimmel chaos.

Kimmel is "by no means the first casualty in Trump's attacks on free speech," he said.

"He's just the latest canary in the coal mine," Oliver said. "A mine that at this point now seems more dead canary than coal."

And, of course, there were laughs as well on Tuesday night.

The soon-to-be-canceled Colbert returned to regular programming during much of his monologue. He dedicated his airtime to ridiculing Trump's performance at the UN General Assembly. Then he poked fun at the president's pronunciation of the word "acetaminophen" and called Trump's claims about Tylenol and pregnancy "crazy."

The joke train kept rolling over at "The Daily Show," where Stewart's colleague Jordan Klepper made more jokes about Trump's joint press conference with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

As for Kimmel, his triumphant return to late-night came with its share of emotional moments. He clarified that he never meant to make light of Kirk's death. He also sent love to Kirk's family, as he had in a social media post that predated the fracas.

Then he pivoted and threw punch after punch at Trump and Carr.

"This show is not important. What is important is that we get to live in a country that allows us to have a show like this," Kimmel said.

Kimmel added, too, that he was lucky to live in a country where freedom of speech is a constitutional right.

"And that's something I'm embarrassed to say I took for granted until they pulled my friend Stephen off the air and tried to coerce the affiliates who run our show in the cities that you live in to take my show off the air," Kimmel said.

"That's not legal. That's not American. That is un-American, and it is so dangerous," he said. "I want you to think about this. Should the government be allowed to regulate which podcasts the cellphone companies and WiFi providers are allowed to let you download to make sure they serve the public interest? You think that sounds crazy?"

In Kimmel's monologue, he also called Carr an embarrassment and said the FCC head's statements about his show were "a direct violation of the First Amendment."

It's safe to say that late-night isn't done talking. And with the battle lines drawn, it's unclear how Disney and other networks with vocal hosts plan to navigate this ongoing dogfight.

Trump has sounded a warning. Before Tuesday night's shows aired, he wondered on Truth Social whether he could reap another multimillion-dollar bounty by suing ABC.

"I think we're going to test ABC out on this," Trump wrote. "Let's see how we do."

Business leaders such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Netflix chairman Reed Hastings have been weighing in on President Donald Trump's new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas.

The US issues roughly 85,000 new H-1B visas via a lottery system every year. The H-1B program is highly popular among US companies looking to hire foreign workers for in-demand roles such as tech and engineering.

On Friday, Trump signed an executive order raising the H-1B visa application fee by $100,000. The White House told Business Insider that the fee would only apply to new applicants, not those renewing their H-1B visas.

Do you have experience with the H-1B visa program? Business Insider wants to hear from you. Please fill out this quick form.

The sudden move has sparked concerns among Big Tech firms like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, whose workers are on H-1B visas. All three companies told their employees on the visa not to leave the US or to quickly return to the country if they were overseas.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed optimism about Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee during an interview with CNBC on Monday.

"We want all the brightest minds to come to the US, and remember immigration is the foundation of the American dream. And we represent the American dream," Huang said in a joint interview with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

The pair announced on Monday that Nvidia was making a $100 billion investment in OpenAI.

"Immigration is really important to our company and is really important to our nation's future, and I'm glad to see President Trump making the moves he's making," Huang added.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the Trump administration's introduction of a $100,000 fee to the H-1B visa program was the right move.

"We need to get the smartest people in the country, and streamlining that process and also sort of aligning financial incentives seems good to me," Altman told CNBC during his joint interview with Jensen Huang on Monday.

Netflix cofounder and chairman Reed Hastings praised Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee, calling it a "great solution" compared to the existing lottery system.

Hastings said in an X post on Sunday that he has "worked on H-1B politics for 30 years."

"It will mean H1-B is used just for very high-value jobs, which will mean no lottery needed, and more certainty for those jobs," he wrote.

"Shark Tank" star Kevin O'Leary said the $100,000 fee on H-1B visas would hurt American companies and limit their access to talent.

"Apple, Oracle, Google all started in a garage. They could have not afforded to do this. And all of those companies took advantage of talent they couldn't find in the United States as they grew," O'Leary told Fox Business's "Varney & Co." on Monday.

"I think what this does is hurt innovation long-term. I agree that it's going to push these really talented people into other countries," he added.

O'Leary said that the US government should, in fact, be paying foreign graduates to stay and work in the US.

"Why train them and kick them out? And if they're available, let's take them all and not charge a 100 grand. We should give them a 100 grand to come here," he said.

Ark Invest's Cathie Wood said Trump's new H-1B visa fee could be a part of his administration's negotiation strategy with India.

In August, Trump raised US tariffs on Indian goods to 50% from 25%. He wrote in a Truth Social post on August 4 that this was because India was not only "buying massive amounts of Russian Oil" but also "selling it on the Open Market for big profits."

The US and India are in the middle of trade negotiations. More than 70% of all H-1B visa holders come from India.

"It's a negotiation with India. Longer term, I think President Trump and his team want to keep as much innovation, talent, and technology talent as possible in the US," Wood said in an interview with Bloomberg on Monday.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the executive order was a rule change that "caught everyone off guard."

In an interview with CNBC this week, Dimon said he supports "merit-based immigration " and expects employers who rely on the program to object to the president's executive order.

"I would beg the president," he said. "He has accomplished border control, that's great, I mean, I think all nations want real border control, that helps make a nation, but after that, we should have good immigration," he said.

A Business Insider analysis earlier this year showed that JPMorgan is a top user of H-1B visas. It ranked first on a list of financial companies that use them.

Royal Bank of Canada's CEO Dave McKay said the US President's move to impose a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas is a win for Canada.

In an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, McKay called the rule a "material opportunity" for Canada to attract more skilled tech workers. He said the country should capitalize on it to accelerate growth in its innovation sector.

"So from India or from South Asia or from Europe, they'll say, 'Well, I can't get into the US, but I want to move to North America — I'll come to Canada,'" McKay said.

The RBC chief added that the Canadian government could lower taxes to make it more attractive to launch and grow businesses.

CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said that his company, like other tech firms, depends on talented individuals to help "build and drive" technology forward.

"Anytime you add an additional fee to it, it does serve as sand in the gears," Intrator said in an appearance on CNBC on Monday.

"Some sand in the gears is acceptable. It is going to be the competitive landscape and we will comply with it," he said. "But it does decelerate access to certain talents."

The Hyptec HT is hard to miss, especially the one I tested in a bright shade of orange.

Over three days behind the wheel in Singapore, the car drew plenty of attention. People stopped to ask what it was, and a few even asked to snap a photo.

Like many new Chinese EVs, the Hyptec HT isn't available in the US. It's made by Guangzhou Automobile Group, or GAC, one of China's largest carmakers.

Hyptec, short for "hyper" and "technology," is part of GAC's Aion brand and represents its bid to tap the booming premium EV market. With the HT, that push is aimed squarely at Tesla's Model Y and BYD's Sealion 7.

The company makes no secret of who it's going up against.

"We are targeting Sealion 7 and Model Y customers, and not creating a new market niche," Bender Guo, GAC's country manager for Singapore and Vietnam, told Business Insider.

The HT's silhouette struck me as very similar to Tesla's Model Y. Interestingly, it was designed at GAC's Advanced Design Studio in Los Angeles, just 15 miles from Tesla's design hub in Hawthorne — though there's no evidence the proximity influenced the design.

The HT wears sharp character lines, a coupe-like roofline, and flush door handles, giving it a futuristic look that blends sporty and premium.

One of the Hyptec HT's boldest design choices is its gullwing rear doors, a touch of "Back to the Future" made modern. Hyptec says they need a little over a foot of clearance, with 12 radar sensors to stop them clipping walls or ceilings.

They felt seamless in use: Press a button, and the doors glide up, making entry and exit easier than expected.

Still, the doors aren't perfect. Testing the car with two young kids in tow, they didn't feel entirely safe. At one point, a closing door required us to move a child's head out of the way — the sensors didn't seem ready to intervene. That said, there is the option for a standard door. The car is also available in less attention-grabbing colors.

For drivers interested in turning more heads, the HT features a choreographed audio-visual "light show" for onlookers — a party trick Tesla fans will recognize.

When I stepped in, the HT felt spacious and comfortable. The cabin leaned into luxury with orange Napa leather and an impressive finish front and back. Large windows and a skylight built into the gullwing doors filled the space with light. With its 2,935 mm wheelbase — the longest in its class — the back seat felt roomy enough for three adults, though taller passengers may want to avoid the middle seat, where the ceiling dips a bit lower.

Rear passengers also get a few indulgences I tested myself: seatbacks that recline to 143 degrees, a fold-out footrest on the left, and a tray table on the right that wouldn't look out of place in a Rolls-Royce.

Up front, I tried the ventilated seats and the 10-point massage system, which offers five modes. I could even choose which part of my back deserved a little extra love.

As expected these days, everything is controlled through a central screen. The car has a 14.6-inch display that handles climate, driving modes, and safety systems. It looks sleek, but adjusting basics like air conditioning required digging into menus. I also found disabling the safety assistance both difficult and annoying.

The cockpit itself was a pleasant place. The steering wheel reminded me of an Aston Martin DBX, and visibility was good all around. Seat comfort was excellent too, making it a car I felt I could drive for hours without fatigue. There was also plenty of storage space.

That said, a couple of details could use fine-tuning. The central air vent never seemed to hit the right angle, and the wireless phone charger was inconsistent, often cutting off mid-charge. I ended up plugging in a cable instead.

Out on the highway, the HT was impressively smooth and quiet. Even at three-figure speeds, wind and road noise are barely noticeable, leaving the cabin cocoon-like. GAC claims a WLTP range of 323 miles, which should be more than enough to get from Los Angeles to Las Vegas on a single charge.

It's a large car, so testing it like a performance sedan didn't make sense. Even so, it was very quick, especially in sport mode, as most EVs are. When a bend tightened more than expected, the HT stayed composed, with the steering delivering a reassuringly precise response.

In China, the top-spec Hyptec HT is priced at 285,900 yuan, or $40,100, slightly above the Tesla Model Y's 263,500 yuan price tag. That puts it squarely in premium-EV territory, but it has the features to back it up — especially those gullwing doors and limousine-like rear seats.

The car was first released in China in 2023 and later launched in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Thailand. GAC is set to expand into Europe next.

With a Brazilian factory slated to open in 2026, the company is signaling its intent to be a frontrunner in the global EV race.

Hedera (HBAR) is gaining traction in global finance, integrating into CBDC pilots like Project Acacia, the AUDD stablecoin, and Australia's AP+ network. With upcoming exposure at SIBOS 2025 alongside Citi and Deutsche Bank, analysts see strong technical upside.

Key support near $0.16 and Fibonacci targets up to $3.30 signal potential for a major breakout, positioning it as a leading blockchain for tokenization and real-world digital payment solutions.

Analyst ChartNerd reports that the native token may be preparing for a strong upward cycle similar to 2021. The chart indicates a comparable consolidation phase that previously preceded a rapid surge. Key Fibonacci extensions outline projected price targets between $1.20 and $3.30 during the 2025/26 cycle if the structure repeats.

The analysis identifies $0.16 (20-week EMA) and $0.11 (0.5 Fibonacci retracement) as critical support levels forming a launchpad for potential growth. The asset trades near $0.22, where maintaining strength above these support levels could signal renewed momentum toward higher Fibonacci extension targets of $1.20, $1.77, and $3.09.

HBAR has recorded a modest 0.82% increase in 24 hours, trading around $0.22. Price movement during this period fluctuated between $0.223 and $0.218 before recovering to current levels, indicating buyer activity around key support. A decisive break above $0.223 could provide a base for testing higher price levels.

Trading volume reached $210.6 million, reflecting steady participation despite intraday swings. The token's market capitalization stands at $9.47 billion, with over 42.39 billion in supply, placing it 25th among cryptocurrencies. Consistent liquidity and a stable supply indicate market resilience as the network approaches a new growth phase.

Beyond technical analysis, the memecoin is strengthening its position within global finance. The network supports central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilots such as Project Acacia, a collaboration between the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre. This initiative explores tokenized assets, stablecoins, and wholesale CBDC use cases on its network.

Hedera also powers the AUDD stablecoin, enabling real-time payments and atomic settlement. According to industry data, more than 70% of Australian retail payments flow through Australian Payments Plus (AP+), which leverages it for scalable settlement. These developments demonstrate the enterprise-grade governance and secure, high-speed network built for regulated financial environments.

The platform's global reach will be visible at SIBOS 2025, where Hedera will share the stage with leading financial institutions, including Citi, Lloyds, and Deutsche Bank. Rob Allen and the Hedera Enterprise Adoption Team are working with banks and regulators to integrate their technology into tokenized markets for assets such as bonds and carbon credits.

With technical setups pointing to a bullish market cycle and expanding adoption in CBDC and stablecoin infrastructure, the asset continues to establish the technological base for digital finance. By combining reliable on-chain settlement with regulatory engagement, the network is positioning itself as a key component in the next generation of payment and tokenization systems.

Oops, something went wrong

Another crypto treasury company is betting on stock buybacks to appease investors, with Thumzup Media Corporation—which is currently stockpiling Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE)—the latest to see its share price climb after revealing such plans.

Thumzup, which trades as TZUP on the Nasdaq, announced its board has approved a $10 million share repurchase program running through the end of 2026. This follows the recent completion of an initial $1 million buyback program this month, as the company repurchased 212,432 shares at a weighted average price of $4.71 per share.

TZUP was recently trading for $4.82 per share, up about 6% on the day. It rose as high as $5.30 earlier in the session. Thumzup stock is down about 20% over the last month, continuing a decline after peaking at $16.49 in early August.

"Our decision to implement a $10 million share repurchase program reflects confidence in Thumzup's long-term strategy and our commitment to delivering value to shareholders," said Thumzup CEO Robert Steele, in a statement. "We believe our balanced approach, combining strategic accumulation of digital assets with investment in its underlying infrastructure, positions us well for sustained growth."

Thumzup said Wednesday that it holds approximately 19.1 BTC ($2.17 million) and 7.5 million DOGE ($1.83 million). The firm's board has also authorized purchases of Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Litecoin, and USDC stablecoin for its treasury.

The social media marketing tech company has also signed a definitive agreement to acquire DogeHash Technologies, a Dogecoin mining operation with 2,500 active rigs and 1,000 additional rigs scheduled for delivery. This acquisition, subject to shareholder approval and closing conditions, would expand Thumzup's cryptocurrency mining capabilities.

Other crypto treasury companies recently instituting stock buyback schemes include Ethereum-focused firms SharpLink Gaming and ETHZilla, along with Solana treasury company DeFi Development Corporation—the last of which revealed plans on Wednesday to repurchase up to $100 million worth of shares.

 Bitcoin bulls are trying to seize control but are expected to face strong selling at $117,500. Will altcoins capitalize on BTC's potential range-bound price action? 

Key points:

Bitcoin made a strong comeback on Wednesday, but the buyers are expected to face heavy selling near $117,500.

Several major altcoins are likely to face selling on rallies, but BNB and AVAX may resume their uptrend.

Bitcoin (BTC) rose above $113,900 on Wednesday, indicating that the bulls continue to buy on dips. Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor said on CNBC that consistent buying by large BTC exchange-traded funds on behalf of institutional investors and increased corporate adoption of BTC could resume the BTC rally toward the end of the year.

Glassnode also said in its weekly report that BTC could hit a new all-time high, but added that history shows the cycle is in its late phase. BTC's current cycle shows similarities with the 2015–2018 and 2018–2022 bull runs, where all-time highs “occurred only 2–3 months beyond where we currently stand when measured from the cycle low.”

However, not everyone is bullish on BTC's prospects in the future. CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno said in a post on X that whales have net sold 147,000 BTC since Aug. 21. That has resulted in the total whale holdings “declining at the fastest monthly rate of the cycle.”

Could BTC overcome selling by the bears and rise to $117,500? Will altcoins follow BTC higher? Let's analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

BTC has started a relief rally, which is expected to face strong selling at the moving averages.

If the price turns down sharply from the moving averages, the possibility of a drop to $107,000 increases. Buyers are expected to defend the $107,000 level with all their might because a break below it will complete a bearish double-top pattern. That may start a decline to $100,000 and eventually to the pattern target of $89,526.

Conversely, if buyers pierce the moving averages, the BTC/USDT pair could rally to $117,500. Sellers could pose a substantial challenge at $117,500, but if the bulls overcome it, the Bitcoin price could reach $120,000.

Buyers are trying to maintain Ether (ETH) above the $4,060 level but are expected to face heavy selling on relief rallies.

If the price turns down from the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) ($4,393), it enhances the prospects of a break below the $4,060 support. If that happens, the ETH/USDT pair could collapse to $3,745 and then to the pattern target of $3,426.

Instead, if the price turns up and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it signals the possibility of a range formation. The Ether price could swing between $4,060 and $4,957 for some time.

XRP (XRP) has been trading inside a descending triangle, which usually acts as a topping pattern.

The bears will have to yank the price below the $2.69 level to complete the bearish setup. If that happens, the selling could pick up and the XRP/USDT pair could move downward toward $2.20.

If buyers want to prevent the downside move, they will have to swiftly drive the XRP price above the downtrend line. That will invalidate the bearish setup, setting the stage for a rally to $3.40.

BNB (BNB) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($957) on Tuesday, indicating that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips.

The bulls will try to strengthen their position by pushing the price above the $1,083 resistance. If they succeed, the BNB/USDT pair could start the next leg of the uptrend toward $1,187.

Contrarily, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bears are selling on rallies. That increases the risk of a drop to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) ($882).

Solana (SOL) slipped below the uptrend line on Wednesday, but the bulls are trying to halt the pullback at the 50-day SMA ($206).

The sellers are unlikely to give up and will try to pull the price below the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the SOL/USDT pair could decline to $185 and then to $175. That signals the Solana price may extend its stay inside the large $110 to $260 range for a few more days.

Alternatively, a break and close above the 20-day EMA indicates solid buying on dips. The bulls will then try to kick the price to $260, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense.

Dogecoin (DOGE) is taking support at the 50-day SMA ($0.23), indicating that the bulls are fiercely defending the level.

The relief rally is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($0.25). If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a drop to $0.21 increases. That suggests the DOGE/USDT pair may remain inside the large $0.14 to $0.29 range for a while longer.

Contrary to this assumption, a break above the 20-day EMA shows demand at lower levels. The bulls will then try to push the Dogecoin price to $0.29. This is a crucial level for the bears to defend because a break above $0.29 clears the path for a rally to $0.35 and then to $0.44.

Buyers are trying to defend the $0.78 support in Cardano (ADA), but the relief rallies are likely to be sold into.

If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA ($0.86), the bears will make one more attempt to sink the ADA/USDT pair below $0.78. If they can pull it off, the Cardano price could tumble to $0.68.

Buyers are likely to have other plans. They will try to push the price back into the triangle and trap the aggressive bears. The up move is expected to pick up momentum above the resistance line. That opens the gates for a rally to $1.02.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) plunged below the uptrend line on Tuesday, indicating that the bulls are rushing to the exit.

The 20-day EMA ($50.67) has started to turn down, and the relative strength index (RSI) is near the 41 level, indicating that the HYPE/USDT pair may have topped out in the near term. Sellers will try to halt any recovery attempt at the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the Hyperliquid price could turn down and drop to $40 and, after that, to $35.

This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the bulls push and retain the pair above the 20-day EMA. The pair may then retest the all-time high at $59.

Buyers have successfully defended the uptrend line in Chainlink (LINK) but are struggling to start a strong bounce off it. 

The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover, and the RSI is in the negative zone, signaling an advantage to bears. Any recovery is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($23.11). If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and breaks below the uptrend line, it suggests that the bears are back in the game. The LINK/USDT pair may then descend to $18.

Buyers will have to drive the Chainlink price above the downtrend line to gain the upper hand. The pair may then climb toward the $27 overhead resistance.

Avalanche (AVAX) turned up sharply from the 20-day EMA ($30.71) on Monday, but the bulls could not clear the overhead hurdle at $36.17 on Tuesday.

A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. The upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the overbought territory indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers push and maintain the price above $36.17, the AVAX/USDT pair could surge to the pattern target of $39.49 and then to $45.

The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-day EMA. That suggests profit booking by short-term traders. AVAX price could then slump to $27.38.

"What": a simple reply by crypto influencer Gainzy pretty much summed up the sentiment when the notorious convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, or SBF, seemingly posted on social media after a long hiatus (and despite being in jail). 

To make matters worse, the token linked to defunct crypto exchange FTX surged nearly 24% in the last 24 hours, after his X account posted a simple "gm" on Tuesday. 

gm

This simple post seems to have been taken as an opportunity by speculative crypto traders to pump the FTT token, which now has no value associated with it, nearly 50%-60% within minutes, reaching a peak of around $1.20-$1.23. Despite his incarceration and clarification that the post was made by a "friend" on his behalf, the token is still up 25%, trading around $1.014, according to CoinDesk data. 

The FTT token has also seen a sharp increase in activity and trading volumes following the post, according to data compiled by The Tie. 

The number of active addresses reached 201, significantly outpacing the monthly average of 56, The Tie said. Additionally, centralized exchange deposits doubled, reaching 13, while withdrawals quadrupled to 38 compared to the monthly average, it added. 

The crypto community on X reacted swiftly with anger, skepticism and humor to SBF's post. 

One of the most scathing replies came from on-chain investigator ZachXBT. In a now-deleted post, he condemned SBF, stating that he “deserves zero human rights” due to the harm caused by FTX's collapse. His view reflects a segment of the community's lingering resentment towards FTX's collapse, which hurt investors who are still waiting for some of their funds from its bankruptcy estate and the broader crypto community.

Other community members, including Laura Shin, mocked SBF's sudden social media activity, saying, "That's so 2021." 

Meanwhile, Arthur Hayes, the BitMEX co-founder who now runs crypto venture fund Maelstrom, took a humorous jab, replying “Wen memecoin?” — a likely playful reference to the speculative, meme-driven nature of the surge in FTT token after SBF's unexpected post. This potentially underscores a view that the price movement was more about market psychology than substance.

The surge in FTT token — once a key utility token for trading fee discounts and staking benefits on the FTX exchange — has been largely dormant since the platform's spectacular implosion that ushered in a brutal crypto winter that devastated many investors. 

However, strangely enough, this is not the first time this has happened. The same thing unfolded in February of last year, when the SBF's account posted on X for the first time in two years. At the time, he was detained in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, and his lawyers were working through an appeal of his conviction (the appeal is ongoing, with arguments currently scheduled for November 2025). 

The new social media post also came as the FTX estate continues to work to repay creditors. 

The FTX Recovery Trust is set to release $1.6 billion to creditors at the end of this month, marking the third major payout since the crypto exchange's implosion nearly three years ago.

This recent activity, though potentially short-lived, shows the token still reacts sharply to headlines and sentiments — especially those tied to its controversial founder.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum's rollup networks are mispricing small transactions, creating risks that range from inflated user costs to denial-of-service attacks, according to a new study by researchers at zkSecurity, Prooflab, and Imperial College London.

The study, “Unaligned Incentives: Pricing Attacks Against Blockchain Rollups,” was posted on Sunday and detailed how different rollups calculate fees for execution, data availability, and proof costs. It concluded that current fee mechanisms are too simple to balance fairness, security, and usability.

Rollups are layer-2 networks that batch transactions and settle them on layer-1 blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana to reduce costs and increase capacity. Rollups are central to Ethereum's scaling roadmap, which relies on these systems to handle high volumes of transactions while the base chain remains limited in throughput.

To operate, rollups must pay for three distinct resources. The first is computation, the cost of executing the transactions inside a batch. The second is data availability, the expense of posting transaction data back to a blockchain so it can be verified. The third is the gas cost for batch settlement and proof verification.

Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Says L2 Base Is ‘Doing Things the Right Way'

These three costs vary independently, but the study finds that most rollups do not account for them separately. Instead, they often collapse them into a single formula or apply fixed rules, which can distort prices.

According to the researchers, this design means small transfers may be mispriced. Users making low-value payments can end up paying more than necessary, while attackers can take advantage of underpriced transactions to send large volumes of spam at little cost.

The authors benchmarked five major rollups—Polygon zkEVM, zkSync Era, Scroll, Optimism, and Arbitrum—and found wide differences in how fees are set. Some networks fix charges at the time a transaction is submitted, others wait until a batch is sealed, and some issue refunds if the actual cost ends up lower than expected.

Those mechanisms may appear technical, but they create opportunities for exploitation. For example, a refund system can be gamed by attackers who submit large numbers of transactions, then reclaim part of the fee while still consuming network resources.

 

Beyond user frustration, the paper argues, these weaknesses create systemic risk. If mispricing allows attackers to subsidize small transactions, then they can mount denial-of-service attacks that clog the network, degrade performance, or raise costs for honest users. The problem lies not in faulty code, but in economic design choices that shape incentives.

The study stresses that these issues matter as Ethereum's rollup ecosystem grows. Rollups today secure tens of billions of dollars in assets, making them high-value targets.

As mitigation, the paper calls for “multidimensional” fee mechanisms that separately price computation, data posting, and proving. Aligning fees with actual resource use, it argues, would make systems more resistant to spam while giving users more predictable costs.

Ethereum Devs Set December Date for Fusaka Upgrade

Tools such as dynamic adjustment, partial batching, and disclosure of cost components could all help address the issue. Some rollup teams are already experimenting with adaptive fee curves and real-time modeling, but the study notes that standards are not yet established.

The findings come as Ethereum advances a roadmap built around zero-knowledge proofs and rollup-centric scaling. Zero-knowledge virtual machines, or zkVMs, promise stronger verification of transactions, but they also introduce proving costs that can spike depending on demand and available hardware. Models that do not account for that variability, the paper says, risk breaking down under stress.

For users, exchanges, and wallets, that can mean inconsistent fees and degraded service. For developers and investors, the study's message is to look beyond headline throughput or nominally low fees and examine how those fees are calculated.

Fundstrat co-founder and BitMine Chairman Tom Lee called Ethereum a "truly neutral chain" and said Wall Street and the White House are coalescing around it as their blockchain of choice.

Flare Network has launched FXRP, a non-custodial, overcollateralized wrapped version of XRP that can be minted and used across DeFi protocols.

Tether is reportedly in talks with investors to raise as much as $20 billion at a $500 billion valuation — which would place it among the world's most valuable private companies, ranking alongside Sam Altman's OpenAI and Elon Musk's SpaceX.

The FTX Recovery Trust sued Genesis Digital Assets, calling Sam Bankman-Fried's investment from sister firm Alameda in the bitcoin miner one of his most reckless uses of commingled funds.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission unveiled a new initiative to let derivatives traders post tokenized assets like stablecoins as collateral, Acting Chair Caroline Pham announced Tuesday.

 Bitcoin's bullish divergences on the RSI metric, along with record-low volatility, were early signs that the rally to $113,900 was in the making. Is the sell-off over? 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin bounced to $113,900 after testing weekly lows, fueled by bullish divergences.

Whale-sized entities have sold 147,000 BTC since August, signaling supply pressure.

Bitcoin options implied volatility hit multi-year lows, hinting at a potential explosive move.

Bitcoin (BTC) staged a swift recovery to $113,900 on Wednesday after sweeping below Monday's low of $111,500 and briefly testing the $111,000 mark on Binance during the Asia trading session. The bounce signaled an early attempt at mid-week recovery, supported by emerging bullish signals on the charts.

One of the key drivers behind the rebound is the bullish divergence between the relative strength index (RSI) and the BTC price on the one-hour and four-hour charts. A bullish divergence occurs when the price registers lower lows while the RSI forms higher lows, often indicating a waning bearish momentum and potential for a reversal.

The recovery also coincided with Bitcoin retesting its daily order block, providing a technical base for a possible push toward $115,000. Still, stronger confirmation is needed. 

A four-hour candle close above $113,400 would signal a clear shift from bearish to bullish structure. Additionally, reclaiming the 200-period exponential moving average (EMA) on the four-hour chart would reinforce positive momentum. 

Crypto traders offered mixed reactions to the move. MN Capital founder Michaël van de Poppe noted the strength of the rebound, stating,

Crypto trader Crypto Chase cautioned that Bitcoin must reclaim the $113,400 to $114,000 range with conviction, or else the recent gains could unravel, sending BTC back toward $107,000.

While Bitcoin's short-term recovery is gaining traction, broader onchain trends reveal diverging signals. Earlier, Cointelegraph reported that whale entities holding 1,000 BTC or more have sold off roughly 147,000 BTC, worth $16.5 billion, since Bitcoin's all-time high above $124,500 in August. 

The 2.7% reduction in holdings highlighted sustained selling pressure from large investors, often interpreted as a headwind for price recovery.

Yet, other market indicators suggest the broader environment remained unusually quiet rather than decisively bearish. XWIN Research pointed out that Bitcoin's implied volatility has dropped to its lowest levels since October 2023, a period that preceded a 325% rally from $29,000 to $124,000 for BTC.

The analysis described the current setup as a potential “quiet before the storm,” where low volatility and muted trader positioning may be storing momentum for a decisive move.

Supporting this view, CryptoQuant data underscored exchange reserves hovering at multi-year lows, leaving fewer coins available for selling. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio sits near the neutral zone, implying limited pressure for either panic-selling or aggressive profit-taking. 

Together, these factors painted a market caught between whale-driven distribution and a structural backdrop of tightening supply.

Oops, something went wrong

Publicly traded electric vehicle charging firm Jiuzi Holdings is adopting a crypto investment policy, after its board of directors authorized the firm to deploy up to $1 billion into acquiring and holding Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB. 

Shares of JZXN jumped as high as $2.38 on the news, a 47% spike above its Tuesday closing price, before retracing completely. Shares are now down nearly 10% on the day and changing hands at $1.46. JZXN is down more than 99.9% in the last 5 years.

“Adopting the crypto asset investment policy represents a proactive step in our treasury management to safeguard and enhance long-term shareholder value,” said the firm's CEO Tao Li in a statement. 

Using a strict risk framework, the Chinese firm was authorized to allocate a portion of its cash reserves into BTC, ETH, and BNB. Any additional crypto tokens would need to be approved by the board prior to investment. 

While the board authorized up to $1 billion in crypto purchases, the firm's latest financial filing with the SEC indicates it only had around $943,000 in cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2024. The firm also reported a net income loss of around $55 million for the fiscal year ending on that day.

While some firms creating crypto treasuries raise funds via convertible notes or private investment into public equity (aka PIPE placements), there is no indication of how Jiuzi Holdings intends to raise funds to purchase up to $1 billion in crypto.

Why Is Solana Falling Harder Than Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP This Week?

A representative for the firm did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment.

The firm will not take custody of any of its crypto assets, and also created a crypto risk asset committee as part of its investment policy framework. 

“We are not engaging in short-term trading or speculation; rather, we view crypto assets as long-term stores of value to hedge against macroeconomic uncertainties,” said its newly appointed COO Dr. Doug Buerger, in a statement.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told Fox Business that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030, while warning of resistance from the banking industry.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes Bitcoin could reach $1 million per coin by the end of this decade — but only if policymakers hold the line against bank lobbyists trying to choke the industry.

“I think Bitcoin could reach $1M by ~2030 based on current conditions and progress,” Armstrong posted this week along with an interview on Fox Business. 

Armstrong pointed to regulatory clarity, U.S. government Bitcoin reserves, and ETF adoption as key drivers of demand.

His optimism comes as Congress works with two major pieces of crypto legislation: the Genius Act, providing rules for stablecoins was signed into law earlier this year, and the broader Clarity Act, which establishes market structure for all non-stablecoin assets. 

Armstrong, who has been roaming Capitol Hill to advocate for the measures, called the legislation “historic” and credited President Donald Trump and Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN) for pushing the U.S. toward becoming the “crypto capital of the world.”

But he warned that big banks are already trying to derail progress. Their latest target: banning rewards programs tied to stablecoins and bitcoin, which threaten the lucrative credit card rewards industry.

“Every company should be able to have reward programs, just like credit card points or airline miles,” Armstrong said on Fox Business. “For [the banks] to come in and try to ban that in the crypto industry is them trying to block their competition, I think most members of the Senate are not going to do a big bailout for the banks.” 

The fight goes deeper than perks. For Armstrong, the debate over rewards exposes the larger conflict between legacy financial institutions and open, crypto-powered rails. 

Banks rely on closed networks and swipe fees; stablecoins and bitcoin payments offer instant settlement and cheaper costs. Allowing crypto rewards is a step toward normalizing an alternative financial infrastructure — one that doesn't run through the big banks.

That, Armstrong argues, is precisely why Wall Street is lobbying so hard. But Armstrong sees the shift as inevitable. 

Coinbase itself has ambitions to be more than an exchange. Armstrong described the company as building a “super app” to replace legacy banks, offering trading, custody, payments, savings, and bitcoin-denominated rewards. 

“Ultimately we want to be a bank replacement for people. We want to be people's primary financial account,” he said.

Bitwise Asset Management says ETH$4,177.62 is rapidly cementing its place as a treasury asset.

Digital asset treasuries (DATs), once largely bitcoin-centric, are now allocating to ether at scale, creating structural demand that exceeds net new supply, the firm said in a Monday report.

"ETH treasuries are no longer a side story. They are becoming a structural pillar in crypto's capital markets," analyst Max Shannon wrote.

According to Bitwise, that demand is reinforced by real yield from transaction fees and maximal extractable value (MEV), which deepens ether's scarcity narrative.

The largest five treasuries, the firm says, reflect a diverse set of strategies, from corporate accumulation and staking to foundations divesting ether to fund ecosystem development. 

This diversity highlights the cryptocurrency's dual identity as both a reserve asset and a productive, yield-bearing instrument, the report said.

Looking forward, Bitwise expects the landscape to consolidate, with “mega whale” and “whale” DATs dominating flows. 

Ether is carving out a distinctive role, not just as a hedge or speculative play, but as a programmable treasury asset that links corporate finance with on-chain economics, the report added.

BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), chaired by Tom Lee, said on Monday that it now controls more than 2% of ether's supply and has raised $365 million to expand its holdings.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Ethereum has reclaimed its position as the primary network for USDT supply, reaching $80 billion and surpassing Tron after falling behind earlier in March. This reversal represents a significant shift in stablecoin infrastructure preferences, with both networks maintaining relatively stable supply levels around $75-$80 billion throughout most of 2025. The close competition between these networks highlights the ongoing shifts in settlement dominance, with marginal advantages potentially driving substantial liquidity migrations.

The redistribution of USDT supply reflects evolving user preferences for blockchain infrastructure, particularly as traditional finance increasingly adopts stablecoin rails. Ethereum's resurgence suggests that users are prioritizing the network's established DeFi ecosystem and institutional-grade infrastructure over Tron's lower transaction costs. Daily stablecoin transfers on Ethereum have reached nearly 1 million transactions per day, indicating not just static holdings but active utilization of USDT for payments and settlements.



This shift occurs as traditional financial institutions increasingly integrate stablecoins into their payment infrastructure. Companies like PayPal with PYUSD and other traditional finance players are incorporating stablecoins into their existing rails, favoring Ethereum's more established institutional presence. The growing institutional adoption of stablecoins suggests that network effects and regulatory clarity will continue to be the main drivers of innovation and adoption.

The competitive dynamics between blockchains for stablecoin dominance carry broader implications for blockchain ecosystem development. The presence of large stablecoin volumes, such as USDT, influences cross-chain bridge activity, exchange integration strategies, and overall DeFi liquidity concentration. Ethereum's advantage in capturing institutional stablecoin flows could reinforce its position as the primary settlement layer for sophisticated financial applications, particularly as traditional finance continues to explore blockchain-based payment solutions.

A strategic partnership with the Hilton Family Office is expected to help Kansas City-based Technology Labs on its mission to protect and educate new investors in the crypto jungle, shared co-founder Travis Wright.

The startup announced Tuesday that Hilton Finance — the lending and investment division of the boutique family office with deep ties to the Hilton Hotel empire — is investing $300,000 into its CoinResearch.ai platform, a cryptocurrency research and investing toolkit using AI-driven insights and tools to empower users to make informed, confident crypto investments.



Hilton's support and strategic reach will enable Technology Labs to accelerate its impact and scale its mission globally, said Wright, co-founder of the startup and host of the Bad Crypto podcast, the second-longest-running crypto podcast.

“It's nice to have somebody see what we've done, believe in it, and then put some more money in as we continue to raise,” he added.

The $300,000 is part of a  $1.3 million fundraising round for Technology Labs and is expected to help with its marketing push.

“Technology Labs is helping define the next frontier of financial research in the AI and blockchain space,” said J. Bradley Hilton, chairman of the Hilton Family Office and grandson of hotel magnate Conrad Hilton, in a news release. “We believe their technology stack is foundational to the future of intelligent investing, and we're excited to be part of this journey.”

Wright — along with CMO Shane Hackett and CTO Eric Fellows — launched CoinResearch in March 2024 after he fell for a honeypot scam — where crypto is put in and can't be taken out — while checking into a potential project, he noted.

“If I'm a guy who's been doing crypto since 2010, I'm pretty sophisticated,” Wright continued. “All these people who are coming into crypto now — what we're calling the ‘E-trade babies,' ‘the Motley Fools,' the Gen X and Boomer investors, who've really have done a lion's share of the investing up to this point — they're going to be bringing their money in and it's not safe. It's a jungle.”

This realization led him to hire several financial researchers to create reports around the best AI projects, he said. Hackett — CMO at Legion Capital and Chairman of the Board at MarketLeverage who made the connections to Hilton Finance — was so impressed by the reports that he encouraged him to turn it into a product.

“We've been working on it now for about 18 months, all self funded,” he added. “Then the Hilton Family Office is like, ‘Hey, we'd like to utilize this information to help us on our new Hilton tech fund.'”

CoinResearch is designed to provide users with in-depth analysis, accurate ratings, and expert recommendations for cryptocurrency investments. Its advanced algorithms analyze vast amounts of data to deliver actionable insights that can help users make informed trading decisions.

“A lot of people in the crypto space will typically raise and have nothing,” Wright said. “They say, ‘Here's what we're gonna do.' Having been in crypto for so long and having paid attention to the crypto markets in the space for so long, I didn't want vaporware. If we're going to raise money, I want us to have something that's legit and built and badass and already working that way. When somebody comes in, they're not just buying hopes and dreams.”

 Coinbase Ventures led a $14.6 million round for Bastion, a startup providing white-label stablecoin issuance with backing from Sony, Samsung, A16z and others. 

Update (Sept. 24, 5:45 pm UTC): This article has been updated to correct the date of Bastion's $25 million raise in September 2023.

Stablecoin infrastructure startup Bastion has raised $14.6 million in a funding round led by Coinbase Ventures, the company said Wednesday.

According to a Wednesday announcement, the round also saw the participation of Japanese tech giant Sony, the investment subsidiary of South Korean phone maker Samsung, the crypto arm of venture capital (VC) firm Andreessen Horowitz and crypto VC firm Hashed.

Bastion is developing a platform that allows companies to issue stablecoins without securing their own licenses or building custom infrastructure.

The startup has now raised around $40 million. Bastion closed a $25 million funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz in September 2023. The company said at the time it had been “building in stealth mode” for months before the raise.

Bastion is a company purpose-built to issue stablecoins for third parties, rather than developing them for themselves. Still, the company offers more than just stablecoin issuance.

Earlier this month, the company explained that thanks to its services, “organizations of any size can now seamlessly integrate Web3 infrastructure into existing technologies through a compliant, white-label platform and API that includes custodial wallets, smart transaction routing, and data analytics.”

Bastion claimed this approach allows building better Web3 products “with the cost-efficiency, compliance, and security they expect from a Web2 technology stack.” The company expects that this will lead to higher growth in the Web3 space:

Nassim Eddequiouaq, Bastion co-founder and CEO, said the company “is growing to meet significant demand for regulated stablecoin infrastructure from some of the world's largest enterprises.” He added:

The raise highlights increasing interest from large corporations in stablecoin technology. Earlier this week, Bullish Europe became the first platform to offer a stablecoin backed by finance giant Société Générale.

Kazakhstan's central bank also launched a pilot project with a new stablecoin pegged to the local fiat currency in collaboration with Solana and Mastercard. In another example, payments behemoth PayPal expanded its PayPal USD stablecoin across eight new blockchains earlier this month.

At the end of July, EURAU, a new euro stablecoin venture backed by Deutsche Bank's DWS, Flow Traders and Mike Novogratz's Galaxy, made its way to the Ethereum blockchain.

Bastion had not responded to Cointelegraph's request for comment by publication.

IREN (IREN), one of the largest self-operated BTC$113,965.34 miners in the U.S., is breaking away from the pack, and Wall Street is taking notice.

Bernstein analysts raised their price target on IREN to $75 from $20, implying about 80% upside, as the miner doubles down on building its own AI cloud business rather than relying on co-location deals with partners like CoreWeave (CRWV).

IREN has already had a major move, ahead more than eight-fold from its 52-week low of $5.13 hit in April. The shares are higher by 365% year-over-year.

The broker now sees IREN's AI pivot as credible, despite early skepticism about the miner's ability to execute on a capital-intensive data center build-out and compete with AI cloud players tied to hyperscalers and Nvidia (NVDA).

IREN is guiding for rapid growth, the report noted, with $500 million in annual recurring revenue by Q1 2026 on 23,300 GPUs, up from roughly $14 million in Q1 2025.

Beyond AI, IREN retains flexibility with its 3 gigawatt (GW) power portfolio, balancing bitcoin mining and AI workloads to maximize revenue per megawatt, Bernstein analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.

Its 50 EH/s mining operation generates an estimated $600 million in annualized EBITDA at current bitcoin prices, funding its AI expansion, according to the analysts.

Bernstein has shifted its valuation approach to a sum-of-parts model, assigning 87% of enterprise value to AI cloud and co-location potential at IREN's 2GW West Texas site, with the remaining 13% coming from bitcoin mining. 

At the revised target, IREN would trade at $7.5 million per megawatt (MW), above other AI-focused miners but still far below established data center peers like CoreWeave, suggesting further room for multiple expansion, the report added.

Ripple's prime brokerage, Hidden Road, has expanded its services to enhance institutional crypto trading. The company has partnered with ABEX, a provider of execution algorithms for institutional trading. This partnership integrates ABEX's technology with Ripple's brokerage infrastructure, offering global clients advanced execution tools in digital asset markets.

Hidden Road and ABEX announced their collaboration to provide agency execution capabilities for digital assets. The partnership allows clients to access ABEX's execution algorithms through Ripple's prime brokerage and custody services. These tools are designed to improve precision, reduce costs, and increase transparency in fragmented crypto markets.

Michael Higgins, International CEO at Hidden Road, commented on the partnership. He stated, “ABEX shares our commitment to bringing precision, transparency, and execution quality to digital assets.” Hidden Road aims to provide institutions with sophisticated tools to enhance their trading experience. The collaboration strengthens the company's position in the digital asset space, offering clients an efficient trading infrastructure.

ABEX's technology focuses on improving trading outcomes by optimizing execution strategies. The integration allows Hidden Road clients to trade across multiple venues while maintaining seamless workflow. The collaboration positions Ripple's Hidden Road as a key player in transforming institutional trading in the digital asset sector.

Ripple's acquisition of Hidden Road in April 2025 enabled the payments company to enter the prime brokerage space. The $1.25 billion acquisition marked a significant move for Ripple, allowing it to operate a global, multi-asset prime broker. Hidden Road's infrastructure complements Ripple's blockchain technology, providing a solid foundation for growing institutional interest in digital assets.

The Ripple-Hidden Road partnership supports clients in trading various asset classes, including foreign exchange, digital assets, and fixed income. Ripple's acquisition strengthens the combined firm's offerings, enhancing its competitiveness in the rapidly evolving crypto market. The new service expansions include advanced execution tools and OTC options for institutional clients.

Hidden Road's recent developments include launching OTC options for digital assets in partnership with QCP and BlockTech. These features allow clients to execute options while leveraging cross-margining on their digital holdings. This addition makes Ripple's Hidden Road even more appealing to institutional investors seeking flexible solutions in the digital asset space.

The trend reflects diverse use cases from remittances to gaming, but regulatory uncertainty could limit long-term potential, analysts say

The Asia-Pacific region has become the world's fastest-growing hub for cryptocurrency transactions, with on-chain activity surging despite inconsistent oversight and varied pathways to adoption, according to a new report.

Analysts say the trend reflects not only diverse use cases – from remittances and savings to gaming and speculative trading – but also regulatory uncertainty across the region, which could limit long-term potential even as momentum builds.

The report, released on Wednesday by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, found that during the 12 months ending June 2025, Asia-Pacific had emerged as the fastest-growing region for on-chain crypto activity, with a 69 per cent year-over-year increase in value received.

Total crypto transaction volume in the region grew from US$1.4 trillion to US$2.36 trillion, driven by robust engagement across major markets including India, Vietnam and Pakistan.

Monthly on-chain value received grew from about US$81 billion in July 2022 to peak at US$244 billion in December 2024, a threefold increase over 30 months. Transaction volumes have since remained robust at above US$185 billion per month through mid-2025.

In contrast to North America, where cryptocurrency activity is largely driven by institutional investment, Asia-Pacific's growth is fuelled by broader, more retail-oriented demand, according to Chengyi Ong, head of Asia-Pacific policy at Chainalysis.

A digital euro could be rolled out in the middle of 2029, European Central Bank Executive Board Member Piero Cipollone reportedly said Tuesday (Sept. 23).

Speaking at a Bloomberg Future of Finance event in Frankfurt, Cipollone said the effort to create a digital euro had a “major breakthrough” last week when relevant finance chiefs reached an agreement on how to set customer holding limits, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.

The effort now has momentum, Cipollone said, according to the report.

The European Parliament, whose legislation is required to enable the digital euro, is set to receive a progress report on the initiative on Oct. 24 and could vote on the required legislation by May 2026, Cipollone said, per the report.

It was reported Sunday (Sept. 21) that European Union finance ministers agreed on a roadmap for launching a digital euro backed by the European Central Bank and that their input was considered crucial to assuage fears that a digital currency could lead to a run on traditional bank deposits.

In February, it was reported that the European Central Bank was hoping that progress on legislative approval for a digital euro would be spurred by U.S. President Donald Trump's endorsement of dollar-pegged stablecoins.

The European Commission put forward digital euro legislation in June 2023, but progress had been sluggish.

Cipollone said in the February report that Trump's support for stablecoins tied to the U.S. dollar introduced another American-driven financial tool and increased the urgency to move forward with a digital euro.

In March, it was reported that European Stability Mechanism Managing Director Pierre Gramegna said that Europe's monetary autonomy and financial stability could be threatened by the Trump administration's interest in cryptocurrencies and dollar-denominated stablecoins.

Gramegna said that in light of the change in the U.S. perception of digital currencies, the ESM believed that “this digital euro is today more necessary than ever.”

Cipollone said Sept. 4 that the European Union should accelerate its efforts to introduce a digital euro, in part because this technology would support resilience and inclusiveness.

A digital euro would complement physical cash, which remains essential for resilience and inclusion, and would provide another universally accepted means of payment, Cipollone said.

“In an increasingly digital world exposed to new geopolitical and operational risks, we must protect the euro's availability for all Europeans at all times,” Cipollone said.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Fundstrat co-founder and BitMine Chairman Tom Lee said Ethereum is a "truly neutral chain" that will be favored by Wall Street and the White House.

"I don't think anyone ever feels that someone's got a fat finger tilting [Ethereum] in their favor," Lee said, during Korea Blockchain Week 2025's Impact conference on Wednesday. "If you think about how Wall Street operates, they will only wanna do and operate on a neutral chain."

Lee further explained that he observed the White House and Congress, which had become more pro-crypto under the Trump administration, are primarily turning to Ethereum.

"So when I look at that, combined with agentic AI and robots that are really gonna create the need for a token economy for robots, a lot of that will happen on Ethereum," Lee said. "In fact, President Trump today just talked about how he needs proof-of-human to protect us, and a lot of that work is going to be done on Ethereum."

When the Wall Street strategist engineered BitMine's transformation into an ETH treasury vehicle, Lee said he saw the possibility that Ethereum was entering a "super cycle" that would last 10 to 15 years. 

Since transitioning into an Ethereum treasury company, BitMine's market capitalization grew from around $37.6 million in June, before the transition, to around $9.45 billion as of Wednesday. 

BitMine is currently the largest Ethereum treasury in the world, holding 2.15 million ETH, according to The Block's corporate treasuries data. It is also the second largest crypto treasury firm overall, behind Michael Saylor's Strategy.



Lee said that he thinks there is room for more than one Ethereum treasury firms, but stated that the market is picking its winners and losers.

"Bitmine trades $3 billion a day, Microstrategy trades $3.4 billion a day. I think the two of us represent 95% of all trading volume in the DATs," Lee said. "The two of us are 90% of the trading volume. That means institutions really only want to buy us."

Lee said the two companies have essentially become large-cap stocks, and they are going to receive passive flows as they will become a part of major indices when they rebalance.

"That really helped MicroStrategy too, and that's actually what sustains valuation premiums, because now you have someone who's buying every day."

Meanwhile, Lee said he expects bitcoin price to end the year between $200,000 and $250,000, while ether is expected to land between $10,000 and $12,000.

"I'm still bullish on bitcoin," Lee said during the conference discussion. "In the fourth quarter, seasonally bitcoin is strong. But now we have the Fed flipping dovish after being essentially hawkish all year. That's a tailwind for bitcoin." 

Lee added that his estimate aligns with Fundstrat CMT Mark Newton's technical targets. 

"Ethereum, as a price ratio to bitcoin, should recover to its prior, either average or at least five-year highs," Lee stated. "Using a $250,000 Bitcoin, that implies somewhere between 10 and 12,000 for Ethereum by the end of the year."

The BitMine chairman said he expects Ethereum to surpass its prior highs, and the cryptocurrency's "real price discovery" will be between $12,000 and $15,000. "But I don't think that would be the ceiling for Ethereum," Lee added.

Register now to hear from inspiring guest speakers and experts on subjects like cyber security, artificial intelligence and legislative reform.  

We have issued an enforcement notice to Bristol City Council (BCC) for failing to comply with its legal obligations to respond to people who asked for the personal information the council held on them – known as a subject access request (SAR). 

Sally-Anne Poole, Head of Investigations at the ICO, said: 

“Subject access requests are a fundamental right that allows people to know what information organisations hold about them and how it is being used. Despite our repeated engagement with Bristol City Council over a sustained period of time, limited progress has been made to clear a backlog of requests. Our investigation has found that the Council's approach towards compliance demonstrates a poor organisational attitude towards data rights and compliance with the law. This enforcement notice requires them to clear their SAR backlog in a timely manner, and make lasting improvements to bring their practices in line with the law.” 

The full enforcement notice can be read here. 

 

The enforcement notice requires BCC to take the following actions: 

People have the right to ask an organisation for the personal data they hold about them, why they are holding it and who they are sharing it with. A person can make a SAR verbally or in writing, including via social media. A person does not need to use a specific form of words, refer to legislation or direct the request to a specific contact. 

You can find guidance on making a SAR on the ICO website. 

If you have concerns about an organisation's response, you can raise a complaint with them directly and then, if unresolved, report it to us.

Bitcoin's recent 10% fall from its all-time high of $124,500 in early August has sparked speculation about whether this is just a healthy pullback or the beginning of a market top.

Now, popular analytics firm Glassnode has released its latest report suggesting that we could actually be witnessing a ‘historically late phase' of Bitcoin's current market cycle.

The most interesting takeaway from the report was Bitcoin's latest cycle being compared with the 2018-2022 and 2015-2018 bull runs.



In both those instances – and in the current stage – the same metrics flashed similar signals.

And in both cases, Bitcoin went on to reach an ATH within the following 2-3 months, which then marked the cycle's market top.

Read on as we unpack Bitcoin's latest fundamental signals with the help of DeepSeek. Spoiler alert: it's not all negative. In fact, there are plenty of positive signs.

And with that in mind, we'll also point you toward the best altcoins to buy right now.

Although institutional and long-term Bitcoin holders have grown increasingly wary of getting in at all-time highs, short-term holders have been aggressively adding the digital gold to their portfolios.

All in all, it's clear that Bitcoin is in a sensitive position right now, with macroeconomic factors like rate cuts and growing crypto clarity working in its favor, while exchange numbers and on-chain data also suggest we could see a potential deeper correction before rebounding.

Whatever the case, it's hard to argue against Bitcoin and crypto in general heading toward a brighter future.

If you want to ride that particular tailwind without getting caught up in short-term corrections or volatility, you'll be better off picking low-cap, high-potential gems that can deliver not only on hype but also on long-term vision.

Here are our top 3 suggestions, based on DeepSeek AI's expert analysis.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is easily the best crypto presale on the market right now, having already raised nearly $18M from early investors in just a few weeks.

Even better, there's no shortage of whale participation in this presale. For instance, two large whale buys scooped up nearly $100K worth of $HYPER just yesterday.

What's driving Bitcoin's growth? A game-changing mission to turbocharge the Bitcoin blockchain with Solana-like speed, scalability, and programmability.

Bitcoin Hyper is a Layer-2 solution that integrates with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), ditching the popular Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), in order to execute thousands of transactions simultaneously, effectively solving Bitcoin's age-old issue of sluggish speeds.



Even better, developers and users on Bitcoin won't have to sacrifice Bitcoin's native security to reap the benefits of Hyper's lightning-fast execution.

That's because Bitcoin Hyper batches the results of all transactions and submits a summary to Bitcoin's main chain.

You can interact with these applications by simply converting your Layer-1 Bitcoin into wrapped, Layer-2 compatible $BTC tokens via Bitcoin Hyper's non-custodial, decentralized canonical bridge.

According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction, the token could hit $0.32 by the end of 2025 – so a massive 2,300% ROI could be yours if you get in now.

1 $HYPER is currently available for just $0.012965, and here's our detailed guide on how to buy Bitcoin Hyper.

Visit Bitcoin Hyper's official website to learn more about how its canonical bridge ensures seamless access to Bitcoin's new Web3 environment.

While many might believe that Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a slightly out-of-the-pocket suggestion when crafting a long-term crypto portfolio, DeepSeek points out that its Dogecoin theme and rampant hype could make it the next 1000x crypto.

If you want to fully understand Maxi's potential, you need to be aware of his backstory.

Both Maxi and Dogecoin belong to the same family of Shiba Inu, but due to the OG crypto's fame, Maxi never received the love and appreciation from his family.

That ignited a fire within him, which he honed in the gym and in the charts, to now emerge as the ultimate Doge nemesis.

Maxi's plan is to dominate the meme coin market, potentially even surpassing Dogecoin in both market cap and raw returns. This mission is fueled by a roadmap that focuses on virality.



The developers have reserved a whopping 40% of the total token supply for promotional activities, including PR campaigns, influencer partnerships, and social media blitzes.

The token has the potential to hit $0.0024 by the end of this year – according to our $MAXI price prediction – giving you an eye-popping 820% return.

At the time of writing, the Maxi Doge presale has accumulated over $2.4M from early investors, with each token available for just $0.000259. Here's how to buy $MAXI in 4 simple steps.

Check out Maxi Doge's official website to learn all about its hatred for Dogecoin, roadmap, and tokenomics.

$BNB‘s recent run-up to new all-time highs, at a time when other mainstream tokens like $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, and $XRP are all either in red or barely in green for the month, have made it one of the best cryptos to watch right now.

Although conventional investing wisdom advises against getting in at ATHs, there's a high likelihood $BNB might not churn out the pullback you're waiting for.

Why? Because it just broke out of a 4-year long consolidation zone, which lasted from May 2021 to May 2025.



Since this breakout, $BNB is up over 50%, and according to this trading pattern, we can expect the token to charge toward $2,000 in the coming weeks.

We arrived at this target by measuring the width of the consolidation phase and projecting it onto the breakout level – according to the technical analysis playbook.

Interested? Buy $BNB today on Binance, or any of the other major crypto exchanges.

Infections of Drug-Resistant ‘Nightmare Bacteria' Are Surging in Hospitals

The infection rate of one type of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales bacteria has risen by more than 460 percent in recent years. Scientists say people receiving treatment in hospitals are at highest risk

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is raising alarm about a sharp spike in infections from dangerous bacteria that are resistant to some of the strongest antibiotics.

A report released on Tuesday by CDC scientists found that, between 2019 and 2023, there was as much as a 461 percent increase in the infection rate of certain bacteria in the group Enterobacterales that can thwart many antibiotic treatments, including a powerful class of drugs known as carbapenems. Carbapenems are used to treat severe multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, including pneumonia and bloodstream, bone and urinary tract infections. These carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) infections are notoriously difficult to treat and can be fatal: In 2020 alone, CRE caused about 12,700 infections and 1,100 deaths in the U.S. Former CDC director Tom Frieden once called CRE “nightmare bacteria.”

The report's authors note that CRE infections are still considered rare and mostly occur in hospital settings. Still, the rise in infections highlighted in the new study is cause for some concern.

“It was shocking to see how large of an increase it was,” says Danielle Rankin, a co-author of the new report and an epidemiologist at the CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion. “The biggest thing for us is that we understand where this is happening because we want to ensure that this does not go outside of health care settings [and] into the community and cause more difficult to treat infections.”

The group Enterobacterales encompasses a wide number of common germs, including Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. One way bacterial species turn into CRE is by picking up specific genes that allow them to evade antibiotics, such as by giving them the ability to make carbapenemases, enzymes that inactivate carbapenems.

The study's authors analyzed cases in 29 states that require hospitals to report and send CRE samples to local public health departments for testing. They looked at overall changes in CRE infection rates, as well as the prevalence of five different types of genes that code for carbapenemases. Overall, the researchers found a 69 percent increase in the rate of CRE infections that involved carbapenemase-producing genes between 2019 and 2013. “We saw this increase in at least every region,” Rankin says.

Among CRE with these genes, those with a gene that codes for an enzyme called New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase, or NDM, had the largest jump in infection rate—461 percent. Such so-called NDM-CRE bacteria are known to spread easily through health care facilities via medical equipment such as ventilators and intravenous tubing. People receiving treatment in these care settings are currently at highest risk, but Rankin says it's not out of the realm of possibility for NDM-CRE infections to occur in other environments.

“The antibiotics we have that are effective against NDM-CRE are only available through IV. They are not an oral antibiotic you can take,” Rankin says. “We are concerned because there is risk that this could spread into communities, meaning that common infections like urinary tract infections that are usually treated with the oral antibiotics may increasingly need to be treated with the IV antibiotics and require hospitalization.”

Rankin notes that the situation with NDM-CRE also plays a part in the larger antimicrobial resistance crisis. “These are genes that can transfer resistance across different bacterial species,” she says.

CDC scientists are still investigating, but they suspect several factors are involved. NDM-CRE can spread from improper hand hygiene among health care providers or inadequate cleaning and disinfection of equipment. Other key factors are insufficient testing and limited access to detection tools. “When NDM-CRE infections are not identified quickly, earlier treatment with effective antibiotics and infection control interventions may be delayed, which can then create more opportunities for transmission from patient to patient,” Rankin says.

She hopes the report shows the importance of using specialized testing to detect these drug-resistant genes so that health care providers can deliver effective—and potentially lifesaving—treatments.

The US government invests in vaccine development to, in part, protect soldiers from dangerous pathogens in various parts of the world.Credit: Jon Cherry/Getty

The abrupt termination last month of nearly half a billion dollars in US government contracts for mRNA-vaccine research rattled scientists working inside and outside industry. The cuts raised alarm about the country's commitment to the Nobel-prizewinning technology, which is credited with saving millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic and is regarded as essential for fighting viruses in the future.

How political attacks could crush the mRNA vaccine revolution

Yet not all large-scale research into mRNA vaccines in the United States is being dismantled. Nature has learnt that, even as the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) — led by vaccine critic Robert F. Kennedy Jr — pulls back, the country's military continues to bankroll parts of the same research.

Among the beneficiaries are programmes developing vaccines against some of the world's deadliest pathogens, including the virus that causes Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a tick-borne disease that kills up to 40% of those infected. In the United States, the government considers such research crucial not only because these pathogens threaten soldiers deployed abroad, but also because they could ignite a global outbreak.

“A lot of us are at least relieved the Department of Defense [DoD] is not abandoning mRNA research,” says Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease specialist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, Maryland.

Still, he cautions that the HHS's rejection of the technology, combined with broader policy fractures across the government, threatens to hobble national — and global — readiness for emerging infectious threats.

“The whole biodefence structure is completely derailed,” Adalja says. “I've never seen it be disconnected like this.”

Peter Berglund learnt that his company's federally backed vaccine programme was being cut the same way that many other affected firms did — in a 5 August notice from the HHS's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), which ordered an immediate shutdown of ongoing studies. For Berglund, chief scientific officer at HDT Bio in Seattle, Washington, the news was a gut punch, as he told colleagues at a conference on RNA-based therapeutics in Boston, Massachusetts, this month.

NIH has cut one mRNA-vaccine grant. Will more follow?

NIH has cut one mRNA-vaccine grant. Will more follow?

HDT had been developing a next-generation CCHF vaccine based on a form of RNA that can copy itself inside cells. The company had secured tens of millions of dollars in federal contracts, which it used first to test a shot in mice1 and monkeys2, and then to begin a human trial in Texas this July. The BARDA memo brought everything to a halt the very next month.

But “that was mommy”, Berglund says. “Then daddy calls.”

Within days, HDT executives heard from project managers at the DoD's Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO) for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense, which had been co-funding the CCHF vaccine research. HDT was told to restart its trial, with the JPEO pledging support through at least this first phase of clinical evaluation.

“It's been so turbulent,” Berglund says. The DoD funding, although substantial, is less than what had originally been pledged in conjunction with BARDA. “But, at least now, we can advance it through phase I” and worry about the rest later, he adds.

Others with projects co-funded by the JPEO also learnt of funding cuts and a “restructuring of collaborations” in the 5 August notice. But their situation is less clear.

Earlier this month, AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company headquartered in Cambridge, UK, began a human trial of two mRNA vaccines, despite the notice. Each is designed to protect against a different strain of avian influenza. Clinical-trial registries still list both BARDA and the JPEO as collaborators.

An AstraZeneca spokesperson declined to comment on the US government's role in funding the trial against bird flu — which has been infecting US poultry and dairy cattle and raising the spectre of a leap into humans. The JPEO did not respond to requests for comment.

In a statement, HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard disputed suggestions that withdrawing from joint projects would weaken the nation's pandemic preparedness, writing that “BARDA is prioritizing evidence-based, ethically grounded solutions”.

The JPEO and BARDA had also been jointly funding a preclinical-stage vaccine programme for biotechnology firm Moderna in Cambridge, Massachusetts3. The mRNA shot is aimed at Marburg virus — a close but even deadlier relative of Ebola — which caused an outbreak earlier this year in northwest Tanzania, resulting in ten deaths. Neither Moderna nor its collaborator, the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, responded to e-mails from Nature seeking comment on the project's funding status.

Maria Branyas Morera had been verified as the oldest living person when she died last year at age 117.Credit: Xavier Dengra (Public Domain)

Maria Branyas Morera lived to the age of 117 with a bit of genetic luck and a healthy diet that included daily yogurts, according to a study published today in Cell Reports Medicine1. During her final year — she died on 19 August 2024 — she was verified as the oldest living person, a feat that drew the attention of researchers who explore the biology of ageing.

“We wanted to learn from her particular case to benefit other people,” says Manel Esteller, a physician specializing in genetics at the University of Barcelona in Spain.

What's the secret to living to 100? Centenarian stem cells could offer clues

What's the secret to living to 100? Centenarian stem cells could offer clues

At the time, Branyas was living in the small town of Olot, in the Catalonia region of Spain, where she enjoyed reading books, playing with dogs and spending time with friends and family, including her two daughters — each in their 90s. Over several encounters with Branyas and her family, Esteller and his colleagues collected samples of her blood, saliva, urine and stool that provided insights into her unique physiology, including her genetics, metabolism and gut microbiome.

The supercentenarian was happy to collaborate. “She was a very humble person,” Esteller recalls. “She said: ‘My only merit is that I'm alive'.”

The researchers compared Branyas's genetic, metabolomic and other profiles with those of women of various ages living in the same region. One of the main insights from the work, Esteller says, is that it is possible to distinguish molecular changes that happen in the body because of ageing from those that occur because of poor health.

For instance, the research team learnt that Branyas's telomeres — the stretches of repetitive DNA that protect the ends of chromosomes — were exceptionally short. Telomeres naturally shorten with age, and unusually short telomeres have been associated with age-related diseases. But Branyas had no such illnesses. “This is telling us that the loss of telomeres is not necessarily associated with disease, it's simply associated with being old,” Esteller says.

Mayana Zatz, a geneticist at the University of São Paulo in Brazil who studies the genetics of healthy centenarians, says the study is thorough but notes that conclusions that are based on a single individual are limited. “It would be interesting to compare the findings with supercentenarians in other populations,” she says.

Metrics details

Cell types are fundamental functional units that can be traced across the tree of life. Rapid advances in single-cell technologies, coupled with the phylogenetic expansion in genome sequencing, present opportunities for the molecular characterization of cells across a broad range of organisms. Despite these developments, our understanding of eukaryotic cell diversity remains limited and we are far from decoding this diversity from genome sequences. Here we introduce the Biodiversity Cell Atlas initiative, which aims to create comprehensive single-cell molecular atlases across the eukaryotic tree of life. This community effort will be phylogenetically informed, rely on high-quality genomes and use shared standards to facilitate comparisons across species. The Biodiversity Cell Atlas aspires to deepen our understanding of the evolution and diversity of life at the cellular level, encompassing gene regulatory programs, differentiation trajectories, cell-type-specific molecular profiles and inter-organismal interactions.

The concentration of proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions must be tightly controlled to maintain cellular homeostasis1,2. However, mechanisms for collective control of these proteins, which tend to localize to membraneless condensates, are less understood than pathways mediated by membrane-bound organelles3,4. Here we report ‘interstasis', a homeostatic mechanism in which increased concentration of proteins within RNA–protein condensates induces the sequestration of their own mRNAs. The selectivity of interstatic mRNA capture relies on the structure of the genetic code and conserved codon biases, which ensure that similar multivalent RNA regions encode similar low-complexity domains. For example, arginine-enriched mixed charge domains (R-MCDs) tend to be encoded by repetitive purine-rich sequences in mRNAs. Accumulation of proteins containing R-MCDs increases the cohesion of nuclear speckles, which induces selective capture of purine-rich multivalent mRNAs. The multivalent regions are bound by specific RNA-binding proteins, including TRA2 proteins, which relocalize to speckles upon interstasis to promote selective mRNA capture. CLK-mediated phosphorylation of TRA2 proteins counters their localization to speckles, thereby modulating interstasis. Thus, the condensation properties of nuclear speckles act as a sensor for interstasis, a collective negative-feedback loop that co-regulates mRNAs of highly dosage-sensitive genes, which primarily encode nuclear condensation-prone proteins.

Fitness screens in multiple eukaryotic species have shown that proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are more likely to be toxic when their dosage is increased1. The toxicity induced by the increased dosage of individual IDR-containing proteins in yeast has been linked to their propensity to phase separate and form biomolecular condensates3. Proteins that are prone to phase separation have the greatest mismatch between protein and RNA abundance, indicating that post-transcriptional mechanisms strongly affect the protein abundance1,2. Many proteins can interact with the RNA or DNA of their own gene, yet no sensors or effectors are known that could regulate the collective expression of condensation-prone proteins5,6,7,8.

Co-condensation of proteins is partly determined by the molecular grammar of short motifs and biophysically similar amino acids in their IDRs9,10,11,12. Many IDRs contain repetitive amino acid arrangements and are thus classified as low-complexity domains (LCDs). One type of LCD is the R-MCD, where arginines are interspersed among other positively and negatively charged amino acids. R-MCDs promote localization of proteins into nuclear speckles10. Major overexpression of artificial R-MCDs has been shown to increase speckle cohesion to the extent that all polyadenylated mRNAs can become retained in the speckles, highlighting the need for homeostatic co-regulation of such proteins10.

Biophysically similar amino acids tend to have similar codons, a characteristic of genetic code that is thought to have emerged to mitigate the effects of non-synonymous point mutations or translation errors13,14. We asked whether the mRNA regions that encode LCDs contain repetitive arrangements of similar sequences, termed ‘multivalent regions'. To generalize the analysis of multivalent RNA sequences beyond specific motif sets, we designed a scoring algorithm that assigns a generalized RNA multivalency (GeRM) score for each nucleotide within provided RNA sequences (Fig. 1a). For a given k-mer at each position along a transcript, a GeRM score is calculated by assessing the similarity of surrounding k-mers, weighted based on the proximity between k-mers (Fig. 1a). A high GeRM score thus indicates that the k-mer is present in highly multivalent RNA regions, where large numbers of similar k-mers are found in close proximity (Fig. 1b). We applied the GeRM algorithm to the longest coding transcript isoform for every human gene and then focused our analyses on the coding sequences (CDSs). For example, the profile of LUC7L3 mRNA reveals a region of high GeRM scores (‘GeRM region') that is highly GA rich and that encodes exclusively charged amino acids (Fig. 1c,d).

Unless otherwise stated, all pairwise significance testing were performed using FDR-corrected Welch t-tests, where *P < 1−15. Precise P values can be found in the Source Data.

We first systematically defined the GeRM regions that were above the threshold of the 98th percentile of the smoothed GeRM scores. To assess the complexity of amino acid sequences in GeRM regions, we calculated their information entropy using a sliding window and found that their entropy was significantly lower than the remaining sequences of the same proteins and to the average throughout the proteome, demonstrating that GeRM regions commonly encode LCDs (Fig. 1e). Moreover, we used AlphaFold2 prediction confidence to approximate protein disorder and found that GeRM regions preferentially encode IDRs, as they are not predicted to be structured (Fig. 1f).

If RNA multivalency was functionally important, one would expect a selection pressure for biases in codon usage that reinforce the multivalency of LCD-encoding regions. To examine such biases, we synonymously shuffled the codons within each transcript and calculated the mean GeRM potential across ten shuffles (Fig. 1c,g). In the example of LUC7L3, codon choices reinforce the GA richness of the CDS region that encodes an R-MCD and is almost entirely composed of charged amino acids (Fig. 1c,d). Conversely, in the example of CCDC61, codon choices reinforce the G richness of the CDS region that encodes an LCD that contains only approximately 40% of charged amino acids and is rich in arginines, alanines and glycines (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b).

To more broadly assess how codon biases reinforce the multivalency of LCD-encoding CDS regions, we then defined LCDs as regions in the bottom 2% of amino acid entropy (Supplementary Table 7). The GeRM potential in regions encoding LCDs was markedly higher than in the rest of the CDS, but synonymously shuffling the codons either across the transcriptome or within each transcript significantly reduced the GeRM potential (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 1h). This suggests that, especially in regions encoding LCDs, codon choices tend to promote the multivalency potential of the RNA.

We speculated that if codon usage supports high multivalency of sequences encoding LCDs, then these codon usage biases would be evolutionarily conserved. We tested every possible synonymous codon substitution in the transcriptome and calculated the change in GeRM potential of each overlapping 5-mer (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Next, we compared the GeRM potentials of the native k-mers and the mutated k-mers. When the ratio of native to mutated GeRM potential is high, then the native codon usage promotes the local multivalency potential. The average ratio for all but four possible synonymously mutable codons was positive, with more common codons having higher ratios on average (Extended Data Fig. 1d). To account for the general differences in amino acid composition and conservation of LCDs (Extended Data Fig. 1f), we normalized the conservation of each synonymously mutable codon and then compared the conservation of the synonymously mutable nucleotide (typically the wobble position) to the conservation of the middle nucleotide in each codon, which can never be synonymously mutated. We found that the more strongly a native codon promotes multivalency, the more conserved the codon is across mammals or vertebrates, and that this effect is especially strong within the regions that encode LCDs (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 1e,g). This analysis suggests that evolutionary selection pressure tends to preserve codons that enhance high multivalency potential of RNA sequences encoding LCDs.

To understand whether RNA multivalency could serve as a template for co-regulation of co-condensing proteins, we assessed its relationships to the LCD molecular grammar. We calculated the contribution of each 5-mer to the total GeRM score of each region, reduced the dimensionality of the data with UMAP and clustered all protein-coding GeRM regions using HDBSCAN. We observed diverse clusters, some of which represented trinucleotide repeats, whereas the largest clusters lacked stereotyped repetition: a GC-rich cluster, a C-rich cluster and three GA-rich clusters (one cluster with more adenines, one with more guanines and one with interspersed cytosines; Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 6). All types of GeRM regions encoded LCDs (Extended Data Fig. 2d), and GeRM regions with similar multivalent RNA motifs tend to encode LCDs that are dominated by similar amino acids (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 2b). The GA-rich GeRM regions encoded domains rich in charged amino acids, with the ratio of adenine to guanine in the multivalent motifs biasing the encoded domain towards positive or negative charge, respectively.

Species to the right of the dashed vertical line are amniotes. The black dashed line denotes no correlation.

Next, we asked whether each type of GeRM region is enriched in mRNAs that encode proteins with related functions. We performed an ontology analysis of gene sets containing each type of GeRM region and found that each set was associated with specific terms (Fig. 2c). The GA-rich GeRM regions were primarily associated with nuclear RNA regulation or chromatin-related terms, whereas GC-rich and CAG-repeat GeRM regions were enriched mainly for transcription-related terms, which agrees with previous studies showing GC bias for codons in transcription factors15. The C-rich GeRM regions were most enriched in the SH3 domain and actin-binding terms, whereas the CU-rich regions were enriched for keratin filament genes. Therefore, each type of RNA multivalency in CDS regions is linked to specific classes of LCDs and enriched in functionally related groups of transcripts.

All RNA multivalency classes in coding regions are reinforced by biased codon usage, as evident by significantly decreased RNA multivalency in all types of GeRM regions after codon shuffling (Extended Data Fig. 2e). These biases are driven mainly by codon choice for amino acids that contain a large number of possible codons, such as arginine, which is common in multiple types of LCDs (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 2c). We calculated the arginine codon usage within each LCD that contained at least 20% arginine (R-LCDs), which could be separated based on codon-usage principal component into those encoded primarily by GA-rich or CG-rich codons (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Those with GA-rich arginine codons were highly enriched for other charged residues and thus included R-MCDs (Extended Data Fig. 3c,f), whereas R-LCDs with CG-rich codons contained more proline, alanine and glycine (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Of note, the GA-biased R-LCDs are much more highly enriched for nuclear speckle, mRNA-processing and RNA-binding Gene Ontology terms compared with GC-rich R-LCDs (Fig. 2e). Conversely, mRNAs encoding proteins with nuclear speckle or RNA-binding Gene Ontology terms show a strong bias towards GA-rich arginine codons (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). Therefore, arginine codon choice within GeRM regions conforms to the multivalent identity of the region by mimicking the sequences of other codons encoding charged amino acids, thereby maximizing the multivalency of RNA regions encoding functionally distinct classes of R-LCD. As representative examples, the arginine codon biases in LUC7L3 and CCDC61 R-LCDs reinforce their distinct AG-rich and CG-rich multivalency, respectively (Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Fig. 1a,b).

As a measure of the distinct arginine codon preference in the two classes of R-LCDs, we observed a positive correlation in R-LCDs between AGA, AGG and CGA arginine codons, and between CGG and CGC codons, and strong anticorrelations between these two groups (Fig. 2d). We used this approach to ask at what point in evolution this codon bias in R-LCDs emerged. We observed the correlations and anticorrelations between AG and CG arginine codons in R-LCDs across a diverse range of species. Although the total proportions of R-LCDs did not dramatically change across species (Extended Data Fig. 3g,h), we observed that the correlations between CG-rich codons, between GA-rich codons and the anticorrelation between these groups were stable from humans to reptiles, but that this pattern was less pronounced in amphibians and other species that diverged earlier in evolutionary history (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 3i). Thus, the codon biases that reinforce the distinct RNA multivalency of two R-LCD classes have become most pronounced in terrestrial vertebrates.

As the accumulation of R-MCDs affects the properties of nuclear speckles10, we investigated whether speckles enable any feedback regulation of R-MCD proteins, and whether GA-rich GeRM regions have any role in such regulation. To assess this, we combined the region encoding the R-MCD C terminus of peptidylprolyl isomerase G (PPIG; Fig. 3a) fused to mScarlet into a doxycycline-inducible PiggyBac vector, which was integrated into a stable polyclonal HeLa cell population. After 16 h of induction, we observed mScarlet–PPIGLCD localization to the nucleus, where it colocalized with SC35, a nuclear speckle marker (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Expression of PPIGLCD resulted in fewer, larger speckles per nucleus, without reducing the intensity of SC35 staining (Extended Data Fig. 4e), consistent with previously reported effects of R-MCDs on speckles10.

We first asked whether the expression of the R-MCD had a dose-dependent effect on the nuclear–cytoplasmic localization of endogenous GA-rich mRNAs. We performed 3′ end sequencing on the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of our reporter cell line after 0, 4, 8 and 12 h of mScarlet–PPIGLCD induction to assess the effect of its gradual accumulation (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 3). We then categorized genes based on their total CDS GA multivalency and looked at the nuclear–cytoplasmic distribution of these genes over time. The nuclear–cytoplasmic distribution of most mRNAs was unaffected by the expression of the reporter construct, but the group of mRNAs with high GA-rich multivalency became increasingly enriched in the nucleus over time, with a quantitative relationship between the degree of GA-rich multivalency and the degree of nuclear retention (Fig. 3c).

To investigate the effect of the observed nuclear retention of GA-rich multivalent transcripts on protein synthesis, we performed pulsed stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (pSILAC). PPIGLCD expression was induced for 12 h, followed by an 8-h pulse labelling period to selectively label and quantify proteins newly synthesized during the PPIGLCD induction window. Comparison of heavy-to-light peptide ratios between doxycycline-induced and uninduced controls revealed a selective decrease in the proportion of labelled peptides encoded by mRNAs with high GA multivalency (Fig. 3d), with minimal effect observed on the translation of all other proteins. Thus, the nuclear retention of GA-rich multivalent transcripts upon PPIGLCD expression corresponds with downregulated translation of the proteins that these mRNAs encode.

To determine whether GA-rich transcripts are specifically sequestered into nuclear speckles, we designed hybridization chain reaction fluorescence in situ hybridization (HCR-FISH) probes against five GA-rich multivalent mRNAs and two non-multivalent control mRNAs. We then induced PPIGLCD expression for 16 h and performed HCR-FISH along with SC35 immunofluorescence (Fig. 3e,f and Extended Data Fig. 4h,i). We found a dose-dependent increase in the proportion of single-molecule FISH (smFISH) signal in the speckles relative to the nucleoplasm for all five multivalent RNAs, but not for either of the two control mRNAs, as evidenced by the slopes and fits of the regression models (Fig. 3g,h and Extended Data Fig. 4j,k). These observations correspond to changes in nuclear–cytoplasmic distribution in our sequencing experiments (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Under these conditions we also observed a slight dose-dependent enrichment of poly-A+ mRNA in nuclear speckles, accompanied by a mild increase in the proportion of nuclear mRNA, indicating that mRNA sequestration is selective (Extended Data Fig. 4d,f,g).

We next asked whether this effect is generalizable across R-MCDs. We transfected HeLa cells with mGreenLantern-fused R-MCDs from three additional proteins (LUC7L3, PRPF38B and SRSF11) and repeated HCR-FISH 24 h post-transfection, with two GA-rich multivalent mRNAs and two non-multivalent controls (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). This induced the selective speckle retention of GA-rich mRNAs, consistent with our observations with PPIGLCD (Extended Data Fig. 5d). We did not observe this effect when transfecting other LCDs with different amino acid identities (Extended Data Fig. 5e–g). We conclude that variations in the concentration of any given R-MCD, or variations in the combined concentrations of all R-MCDs, drive the selective retention of GA-rich mRNAs in nuclear speckles. We quantified PPIGLCD expression at the protein and RNA level and found that a 15% increase in the total abundance of R-MCDs in the cell is sufficient to induce selective mRNA retention (Extended Data Fig. 4i,m). Thus, modest changes in the concentration of R-MCDs can selectively control the export of mRNAs containing GA-rich GeRM regions, which encode R-MCD or other charged proteins.

To assess whether the nuclear retention of GA-rich mRNAs decreases the synthesis of encoded proteins, we created codon-biased versions of a GA-rich region in LUC7L3 mRNA that encodes an R-MCD (Fig. 1c,d), such that it either had a high or low GA multivalency but equivalent GC content. We then cloned this region as a 3′ untranslated region (UTR) sequence downstream of a CDS encoding mGreenLantern. We transfected each of these two constructs into our mScarlet–PPIGLCD reporter cell line, induced PPIGLCD expression for 16 h, and measured the intensity of mScarlet and mGreenLantern in each cell. We found that as the expression of mScarlet–PPIGLCD increased, expression of mGreenLantern strongly decreased when the 3′ UTR of mGreenLantern contained a highly multivalent GA-rich sequence, whereas the effect was significantly weaker when the sequence was codon biased to decrease the GA content (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Thus, modestly increased concentration of an R-MCD protein decreases the synthesis of other R-MCD proteins due to the broad effect on the retention of endogenous GA-rich mRNAs. We refer to this mutual homeostatic co-regulation of LCD-containing proteins as interstasis.

To further characterize the proteins that are co-regulated through interstasis, we examined the properties of the proteins encoded by mRNAs that were significantly retained in the nucleus after PPIGLCD expression. These proteins are enriched in IDRs, which are longer than average and have increased densities of charged amino acids (Fig. 4a,b and Extended Data Fig. 4c) and to a lesser extent also non-charged polar amino acids (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Moreover, their genes are enriched for ontology terms related to the nuclear speckle, chromatin remodelling, RNA binding and RNA processing (Extended Data Fig. 6k). To account for the strong enrichment of Gene Ontology terms related to nuclear compartments, we compared all proteins that localize to speckles, nucleoplasm or nuclear bodies as defined by the Human Protein Atlas16 to the subset of these proteins that are co-regulated through interstasis, and found that these have extremely high condensation potential as predicted by the FuzDrop model17 (Extended Data Fig. 6d).

Genes encoding IDR-containing proteins were reported to be more dosage sensitive in yeast, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans1. Therefore, we analysed the dosage sensitivity that was estimated from the analysis of rare copy-number variants in the human genome18. This identified a striking trend for bidirectional dosage sensitivity of the genes encoding nuclear proteins that are under interstatic co-regulation, with high pHaplo and pTriplo scores that correspond to haploinsufficiency and triplosensitivity (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). Furthermore, bidirectional dosage sensitivity was confirmed by gnomAD scores, showing higher mutational constraint of genes under interstatic regulation than controls19 (Extended Data Fig. 6g,h). Thus, interstasis enables homeostatic dosage co-regulation of genes that are bidirectionally dosage sensitive and mutationally constrained. Finally, the genes under interstatic co-regulation had higher scores by the dosage sensitivity-based phase separation predictor model (DosPS)20, confirming the combined trends for strong dosage sensitivity and the high condensation potential of their proteins (Fig. 4c). We thus propose that interstasis protects from the toxicity that can arise from deregulation of the most dosage-sensitive genes through its collective homeostatic regulation of the most condensation-prone proteins.

The packaging and compaction of mRNPs have been recognized as important steps in mRNA maturation and export21,22. When an intron is removed from pre-mRNA, the spliceosome deposits the exon junction complex (EJC) upstream of the exon–exon junction. The EJC promotes the packaging of the mRNA into a compact mRNP, facilitating the loading of further mRNA export factors22. Previous work has shown that both mRNA sequence and gene architecture can influence mRNA export, but the relationship between sequence-specific RBP assemblies and mRNP packaging remains incompletely understood23,24,25. We reasoned that EJC deposition upstream of exon–exon junctions could limit the accessibility of multivalent sequences, preventing interstatic regulation. To assess this, we trained a random forest classifier to predict transcripts that become retained in the nucleus after 12 h of PPIGLCD expression. The input features of the model included total CDS length, mean exon length (inversely proportional to EJC density) and multivalent RNA features. We trained an array of models using a stepwise feature-selection approach to find that a combination of four features — CDS length, mean exon length, GA-rich and CAG-rich multivalency — led to a model with the best predictive performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.87; Fig. 4d). All of these features individually contributed to mRNA responsiveness; CDS length (AUROC = 0.83) was the strongest determinant of responsiveness, whereas GA-rich and CAG-rich multivalency, as well as mean exon length, further improved the performance of the model (Extended Data Fig. 6l–o). Furthermore, when we categorized mRNAs based on whether 50% of their GA-rich multivalency was within 50 nt of the expected EJC-binding region, GA-rich multivalent sequences were less capable of inducing nuclear mRNA retention upon PPIGLCD overexpression when they were proximal to the EJC (Extended Data Fig. 6i,j).

To address the importance of EJC density and sequence multivalency in the absence of variable CDS length, we designed a novel reporter system in which mScarlet–PPIGLCD is encoded with variable codon choices and variable exon number, whereas its CDS length remains constant. This allowed us to assess whether EJC density could limit the accessibility of multivalent RNA for RBP assembly (Fig. 4e). The reporter plasmid pool was generated by Gibson assembly of eight fragments in sequence, each of which varied in two ways: having GA-rich or GA-poor codons, and either containing or lacking an intron, in which intron splicing efficiency was maximized using in silico mutagenesis to maximize SpliceAI scores26. The combination of these two variables leads to four possible options for each fragment of the CDS (Fig. 4f). This generated a library of reporter sequences that all produced the same protein but differed at the RNA level in their degree of GA-rich multivalency and in the number of constitutive introns (Fig. 4f). As previous work has implicated transcript GC content in the steady-state nuclear–cytoplasmic abundances, we ensured that the GC content of the CDS was kept constant25. Owing to the constraints on GC content and splicing efficiency, the most highly multivalent sequence was marginally less multivalent than the native RNA sequence that encodes PPIGLCD, whereas the least multivalent sequence was still more multivalent than most random CDSs of the same length (Supplementary Fig. 2b).

Gibson assembly yielded a pool of approximately 45,000 uniquely barcoded plasmids as identified by targeted sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 2c), with a comparable representation of all possible fragments (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Sixteen hours after transfecting this plasmid pool, we isolated the RNA and confirmed with long-read sequencing that all the introns in the reporter were efficiently spliced (Supplementary Fig. 2d–f). Given the roles of nuclear speckles in enhancing splicing efficiency27, this enabled us to rule out inefficient splicing as a confounding factor influencing RNA localization. Next, we collected RNA from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions at 16 h post-transfection and performed targeted sequencing of the plasmid barcodes. Of note, the nuclear retention of reporter mRNAs scaled with the degree of GA-rich multivalency (Extended Data Fig. 7a). To test whether the degree of nuclear retention depends on the extent of the R-MCD expression, we generated a stable inducible pooled cell line expressing the library of reporter constructs, induced expression for 4, 8 and 12 h, and sequenced the nuclear and cytoplasmic barcodes at each timepoint. The nuclear retention of highly multivalent sequences was significantly stronger at 12 h than at 4 or 8 h (Fig. 4g). We replicated this effect by transfecting the reporter plasmid pool for 8 or 24 h and sequencing the nuclear and cytoplasmic barcodes (Extended Data Fig. 7b). To assess the stability of the reporter transcripts, we induced the pool for 16 h, sequenced the RNA after 0, 2, 4 and 8 h, and found no relationship between the multivalency of transcripts and their stability (Extended Data Fig. 7f). Therefore, the expression level of the R-MCD dictates the selective nuclear retention of its own multivalent mRNAs.

We also addressed the role of splicing-mediated EJC loading with our reporter system, because in the reporter pool each of the eight fragments had a chance to contain an intron, thus the total number of exons varied between reporters. If all 8 fragments included an intron, there were 9 exons between 162 and 211 nt in length, whereas most reporters had 5–6 exons. Exon number alone had a weak influence on the nuclear–cytoplasmic distribution of reporter transcripts (Extended Data Fig. 7c). However, for the more multivalent reporter transcripts, exon content had a strong effect on nuclear retention: if a reporter transcript had a small number of longer exons, it was increasingly retained over time, but if a reporter had a greater number of shorter exons, it did not accumulate in the nucleus (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 7e). We observed the same effect, although weaker, when transfecting the plasmid pool, suggesting that chromatin context may promote the EJC-dependent mRNP packaging (Extended Data Fig. 7d). This confirms that multivalent GA-rich RNA sequences confer the greatest potential for nuclear retention when they are positioned inside long exons, where multivalent RBP assemblies are less able to be influenced by EJC-mediated mRNP packaging.

Previous insights from the RNA binding of TDP-43 demonstrated that its condensation promotes binding to highly multivalent RNA regions, which includes binding to its own GU-multivalent mRNA that promotes homeostatic control of TDP-43 dosage28. Here we asked whether increased condensation of nuclear speckles could promote the capacity of specific RBPs to recruit GA-multivalent mRNAs into speckles and thus enable interstasis. To identify the RBPs that might bind to GA-multivalent mRNAs in interstasis, we first investigated how the GA multivalency of reporter constructs correlates with the abundance of high-affinity binding motifs for different RBPs. We obtained significantly enriched 5-mers for 79 RBPs (P < 0.05) from RNA-Bind-N-Seq experiments29,30,31 and used the abundance of these 5-mers and their Z scores to assign a binding potential score to each reporter sequence. We found that GA multivalency had the strongest correlation with the binding potential scores of nuclear speckle proteins TRA2A (r = 0.97) and TRA2B (r = 0.95; Fig. 4i). Thus, the synonymous mutations of arginine codons are expected to promote binding of TRA2 proteins to the GA-rich multivalent regions, which could mediate the variable nuclear retention of the reporter library.

Next, we gathered public iCLIP and eCLIP datasets32,33,34,35,36 and identified RBPs that preferentially bind to multivalent regions in the CDS. To identify RBPs with preference for multivalent sequences, we determined whether RBPs preferred to bind to a motif when it was in a highly multivalent context, rather than when the same motif was surrounded by dissimilar sequences. For example, UPF1 shows no bias towards multivalency for its most bound motifs, whereas TRA2B strongly prefers to bind to its most bound motifs in a multivalent context (Extended Data Fig. 8i,j). This identified 34 CLIP datasets in which protein had a preference to bind its favoured motifs in a more multivalent context (Fig. 5a, y axis). To determine the preferences for specific types of multivalencies, we then compared the density of crosslink sites within each type of CDS GeRM region to the rest of the CDS of that transcript, which showed that each type of GeRM region shows enriched binding of specific sets of RBPs (Fig. 5a). The GA-rich multivalent regions were bound by a large number of RBPs that have been observed to be enriched in nuclear speckles32,37,38 (Fig. 5a, bold), including six SR proteins that preferentially assemble on GA-rich GeRM regions, with the TRA2 SR proteins showing the strongest enrichment on these regions.

For example, TRA2 and several other SR proteins bind strongly and specifically to the GA-rich GeRM region that encodes the charged disordered domain of APP (Fig. 5b). We also performed iCLIP for endogenous TRA2B from mouse embryonic stem cells, which confirmed the strong enrichment around the GA-rich GeRM regions of CDSs (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b), and additionally showed that iCLIP reads were more likely to contain a splice junction when the protein was bound to a GA-rich exon, confirming that TRA2B remains bound to multivalent sites post-splicing (Extended Data Fig. 8c). Thus, analyses of reporter and CLIP experiments provide independent lines of evidence implicating TRA2 proteins as likely effectors of interstasis in nuclear speckles.

TRA2 proteins are known to enhance splicing of GA-rich exons33. We therefore analysed public data in which TRA2A and TRA2B were co-depleted, which increases skipping of both alternative and constitutive exons33, but found no trend for skipping of the exons with GA-multivalent GeRM regions (Extended Data Fig. 8d,e). Moreover, data from VastDB39 demonstrate that the GA-multivalent exons from the mRNAs that are retained upon interstasis are highly constitutive across all available human tissues (Extended Data Fig. 8f). In addition, our randomized reporter analysis did not show any link between GA-rich exons and splicing changes of either the exons or their flanking introns during interstasis (Supplementary Fig. 2f). We conclude that binding of SR proteins to highly multivalent GA-rich exons is rarely associated with the modulation of alternative splicing.

For a protein to be an effector of the interstatic dosage loop, it should be sensitive to the dose of R-MCD proteins. Indeed, TRA2B was diffuse throughout the nucleoplasm in the absence of PPIGLCD expression, with only mild colocalization with the nuclear speckle marker SC35, but became enriched in nuclear speckles 16 h after the induction of PPIGLCD (Fig. 5c,d). The degree of speckle localization correlated with the dose of PPIGLCD, similar to retained GA-rich mRNAs. The same dose variations of R-MCD protein induced speckle retention of TRA2B and nuclear GA-rich mRNA to a similar extent, indicating that TRA2B could be an effector that drives the sequestration of GA-rich mRNAs in the nuclear speckle.

To demonstrate the role of TRA2 proteins in modulating selective purinergic mRNA sequestration, we performed short-interfering (siRNA)-mediated depletion of TRA2A and TRA2B in cells expressing PPIGLCD (Extended Data Fig. 8g,h and Supplementary Fig. 1a). Using HCR-FISH of EIF3A to examine the degree of GA-rich transcript retention in nuclear speckles, we showed a dose-dependent relationship of the effect of TRA2 proteins on EIF3A mRNA localization. Cells were grouped by their PPIGLCD expression intensity to ensure that observed effects were not attributed to changes in PPIGLCD expression driven by TRA2 depletion itself. At lower levels of PPIGLCD expression that are sufficient to promote the retention of EIF3A mRNA in nuclear speckles in control conditions, double TRA2A/B knockdown significantly decreased speckle retention of EIF3A (Fig. 5e,f). When R-MCD concentrations become very high, the effect of TRA2A/B knockdown diminished, indicating that at such concentrations, other RBPs that assemble on GA-rich multivalent regions could also drive speckle mRNA retention (Fig. 5a,b). This suggests that TRA2 proteins are key effectors of interstasis upon modest accumulation of R-MCDs, which more probably represents physiological variation.

To determine whether the R-MCD proteins or their GA-rich mRNA itself drives the relocalization of TRA2B to the nuclear speckle, we created a construct encoding mGreenLantern fused to the R-MCD of LUC7L3 (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Two versions of each construct were made with opposing codon biases in LUC7L3, to create either GA-rich or GA-poor sequences (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Upon transfection of the constructs, the LUC7L3 R-MCD protein localized to nuclear speckles, and it drove the speckle localization of TRA2B regardless of whether it was expressed from GA-rich or GA-poor sequences (Extended Data Fig. 9b,d,e). We also created a construct in which a stop codon had been inserted upstream of the GA-rich sequence that would otherwise encode the LUC7L3 R-MCD, thus making it part of the 3′ UTR, and this construct had no effect on TRA2B localization (Extended Data Fig. 9c–e). This confirmed that accumulation of R-MCD proteins, rather than their mRNAs, drives TRA2B relocalization, and TRA2B promotes the sequestration of GA-rich mRNA into the speckles.

Localization of SR proteins within nuclear speckles is regulated by their phosphorylation via various kinases, such as the CDC2-like (CLK) family of kinases40,41. Previous work has indicated that serine phosphorylation in SR domains disrupts arginine-driven self-association in nuclear speckles10. CLK kinase activity is regulated under a diverse array of physiological contexts, including during the cell cycle and in response to small variations in temperature42,43. Given the role of TRA2, and probably other SR proteins, as mediators of interstasis, we asked whether the set point of interstasis could be modulated by the activity of CLK kinases.

We treated HeLa cells for 8 h with 1 µM CLK-IN-T3, a selective inhibitor of CLK1, CLK2 and CLK3 (ref. 44), and confirmed that TRA2B and other SR proteins became less heavily phosphorylated (Extended Data Fig. 10j and Supplementary Fig. 1b). We observed that CLK-IN-T3 treatment induced a strong relocalization of TRA2B to nuclear speckles, and a mild enrichment of poly-A+ mRNA in the nucleus, especially within speckles (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig. 10a–c). Upon 16 h of CLK-IN-T3 treatment, speckles became larger and fewer in number (Extended Data Fig. 10g,h). Thus, CLK kinase inhibition produces a similar phenotype to the overexpression of an R-MCD with regards to mRNA and TRA2B localization and nuclear speckle morphology.

Source data

To test the selectivity of speckle mRNA localization, we repeated HCR-FISH after 16 h of CLK-IN-T3 treatment, which significantly increased the localization of the GA-rich EIF3A and BRD4 mRNAs, but not control mRNAs, to nuclear speckles relative to the nucleoplasm (Fig. 6b and Extended Data Fig. 10d–f). To assess the sequence-specific effect on mRNA retention using our reporter system, we treated cells with 1 µM CLK-IN-T3 or DMSO for 2 h, then induced the expression of the reporter transcript pool with doxycycline for 6 h, at which point the expression of the PPIGLCD protein is still negligible, and performed targeted sequencing of the reporter mRNAs. We found that CLK inhibition significantly increased the nuclear retention of the GA-multivalent reporter transcripts (Fig. 6c). To assess the effect on the nuclear–cytoplasmic distribution of endogenous mRNAs, we performed 3′ end sequencing of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions after 8 h of CLK-IN-T3 treatment, which increased the nuclear retention of mRNAs with GA-rich GeRM regions in CDSs (Extended Data Fig. 10i). The extent of nuclear retention of each transcript was correlated between 8-h CLK inhibition and 12-h PPIGLCD expression (Extended Data Fig. 10k), indicating that both R-MCD abundance and CLK activity can modulate the retention of multivalent mRNAs in nuclear speckles.

We report the discovery of interstasis, a collective feedback loop mediated by a protein–RNA condensate that promotes the homeostasis of a broad range of condensation-prone proteins. Most of these are proteins that interact with RNA, DNA and chromatin, which tend to be enriched in IDRs across all domains of life45. Using a novel combinatorially assembled reporter strategy to study mRNA selectivity upon interstasis, we validated the importance of codon biases in the nuclear retention of multivalent mRNAs that encode condensation-prone proteins. Our findings suggest a model in which nuclear mRNA retention is promoted by multivalent assemblies of specific RBPs that localize to nuclear speckles, whereas EJC-dependent packaging counteracts such mRNA capture. We showed that upon increasing the dosage of condensation-prone proteins in speckles, TRA2B relocalizes to speckles, acting as a dosage effector that promotes the capture of multivalent mRNAs (Fig. 6d). By managing the most condensation-prone nuclear proteins that tend to localize into speckles, interstasis probably protects speckles from reaching the toxic levels of cohesion that could non-specifically capture mRNAs10. Thus, the properties of a condensate can serve as the long-sought mechanistic link between dosage sensing of IDR-containing proteins and dosage effectors that control their gene expression.

The multivalency of CDS regions encoding IDRs emerges partly due to the structure of the genetic code, that is, the high similarity of codons for biophysically similar amino acids, which tend to cluster within IDRs. Moreover, we found that codon biases further increase such RNA multivalency, especially in the transcriptomes of land vertebrates. All classes of multivalent CDS regions contain strong codon biases that reinforce multivalency, and each class is bound by specific RBPs and encodes IDRs within functionally coherent sets of proteins, indicating a broad potential for their co-regulation. Although autologous interaction between RBPs and their own mRNAs have been linked to affinities between amino acids and their cognate codons46,47, broad feedback regulation of a class of related IDRs and their mRNAs, or the role of codon biases in reinforcing such feedback have not been previously observed. Understanding how codon biases might enable feedback regulation between specific sets of proteins and their multivalent mRNAs has implications for various fields, such as interpreting the effect of synonymous mutations on human diseases48, and for the design of synonymous gene-recoded therapeutics49.

Nuclear retention of several spliced mRNAs has been identified in human tissues50, and phosphorylation of SR proteins has been shown to promote speckle mRNA retention; however, the selectivity of such retention remained unclear51. We found that the activity of CLK family kinases modulate selective speckle retention of highly multivalent, GA-rich mRNAs. Eight-hour inhibition of CLK kinases phenocopies the same selectivity of mRNA retention as the increased R-MCD expression, as it leads to hypophosphorylation of SR proteins such as TRA2B, which we found to be a key effector of the GA-rich mRNA sequestration into nuclear speckles. CLK signalling is responsive to various physiological states, including cell-cycle progression and small variations in temperature42,43, and is investigated as a therapeutic target for many diseases40, indicating a broad potential for altered signalling to modify the threshold of interstasis in specific cellular contexts.

The roles in the compartmentalization of biochemical reactions, such as the capacity of speckles to promote the efficiency of splicing, have been the focus of the functional studies of condensates27. It has been proposed that an additional function of endogenous condensates could be to buffer cellular noise due to their concentration-dependent assembly52, but it remained unclear how heterotypic interactions between diverse sets of proteins and RNAs could contribute to such buffering53. We now identify such a function for nuclear speckles, which serve as collective sensors of the combined dosage and modifications of co-condensing proteins. By capturing the mRNAs encoding these proteins, speckles promote the dosage homeostasis of proteins that are expressed from some of the most bidirectionally dosage-sensitive and mutationally constrained genes. It remains to be seen whether nuclear speckles thereby help to protect proteostasis during conditions that affect the relative concentrations of proteins in nucleoplasm, or in diseases with aberrant protein condensates, thereby complementing known pathways for protein quality control that primarily sense cytoplasmic disturbances54. Many age-related diseases, especially in neurodegeneration, involve aberrant protein–RNA condensates that can eventually promote aggregation of IDR-containing proteins4,55,56, and are often caused by low-complexity repeat expansions that can involve speckle recruitment of the repeat RNA57,58. Understanding the mechanisms that manage the homeostasis of proteins in condensates could open new therapeutic opportunities for these diseases55. In summary, we have demonstrated a new principle of a ‘collective autoregulatory protein–RNA circuit' controlled by the mesoscale properties of a condensate.

GeRM is calculated from a string of consecutive overlapping nucleotide sequences of length k (k-mers). From the set of n consecutive k-mers A, the GeRM score g of the central k-mer A0 is calculated as follows:

where B = −w,…,−k,k,…,w

where \(w=\frac{n+1}{2}\), the function d represents the Hamming distance, and λ represents a scaling constant.

In non-mathematical terms, the GeRM score is calculated by comparing a k-mer to all the other k-mers that surround it in a fixed window. For each of the surrounding k-mers, the sequence similarity to the central k-mer is calculated from the negative exponent of the Hamming distance, such that k-mers with identical sequences have a high score and those with unrelated sequences have a low score. The constant λ determines how quickly this similarity score decays as sequences become more dissimilar to the central k-mer. This sequence similarity score is multiplied by a distance score, which decays linearly from 1 to 0 with distance from the central k-mer. k-mers that overlap with the central k-mer are ignored. For k-mers at the edges of transcripts, where the window exceeds the end of the transcript, all positions that fall outside of the transcript are given a score of 0. The sum of all the distance-weighted sequence similarities is summed to give the GeRM score.

In this Article, we used a k-mer length (k) of 5, a window size (n) of 123 and a scaling factor (λ) of 1. We normalized the GeRM scores such that the minimum value in the transcriptome was 0 and the median was 1. Smoothing of GeRM scores was performed by taking the mean of values in a sliding window of size 123.

For the calculation of codon-shuffled multivalency, all codons for a given amino acid in each transcript were swapped such that the number of instances of each codon was preserved for each transcript, but their order was randomized. All GeRM scores for each transcript were calculated, and the mean GeRM score per position across ten shuffles was calculated.

The GeRM algorithm is available as an R package from GitHub (https://github.com/ulelab/germ).

For each protein-coding gene in GENCODE 29 or GENCODE M22, the transcript with the longest CDS was selected and ties were broken by the longest total transcript length. Only spliced transcripts were used for analysis. CDS GeRM regions were defined by taking all positions where the smoothed GeRM scores exceeded the 98th percentile of smoothed GeRM scores within the CDS, and GeRM regions were adjusted to contain all k-mers that fell within the smoothing window. GeRM regions with at least 41 nt of overlap were merged. GeRM regions for which at least one-third of the region fell within an untranslated region were excluded.

For each GeRM region, the relative proportion of the total multivalency of the region that was accounted for by each possible k-mer was calculated. For clustering, UMAP was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data to 4 dimensions, using 50 neighbours and a minimum distance of 0.001. The reduced data were clustered first using OPTICS with the minimum points defined by 1% of the total number of GeRM regions. The final clustering was performed with DBSCAN, yielding eight clusters. The reachability threshold for DBSCAN was defined by determining how the proportion of points below a given threshold changed as the reachability threshold decreased (from the 99th percentile to 0), then taking the point at which the first derivative was 40% of the maximum (the knee of the plot). GeRM regions falling outside of a cluster were excluded from further analysis. For presentation purposes, UMAP was used to reduce the original data to have two dimensions, with other parameters kept the same.

Codon shuffling was performed by shuffling the codons either within the entire transcriptome or within each transcript. Shuffling was performed five times, and GeRM scores were calculated from the shuffled sequences. The mean GeRM score per k-mer across the five shuffles was used for further analysis.

To generalize the scoring of identified multivalent types (that is, the GA-multivalency score and transcript multivalency), we summarized each GeRM cluster with the k-mers that contributed most to multivalency of regions in that cluster. The proportion of total multivalency accounted for by each 5-mer was calculated, and 5-mers were sorted in descending order based on this proportion. The cumulative sum was calculated, and all 5-mers that accounted for the first 50% of the multivalency in each GeRM cluster were selected as representative 5-mers for this multivalency type.

To define the complexity of amino acid sequences, information entropy was calculated using the R package HDMD in a sliding window of 41 amino acids along the translated CDSs from the set of transcripts used for GeRM scoring. LCDs were defined as regions with entropy in the bottom 2% of all entropy scores, with all amino acids in the sliding window being considered part of the LCD. LCDs that overlap were merged. AlphaFold59 predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) scores were obtained for the same set of proteins where available from UniProt.

To determine whether a given position in a sequence supported the local multivalency of that sequence, we defined a GeRM codon ratio. First, ‘mutable positions' were defined as any position that could be synonymously mutated. Primarily, these are the final position of the codon, but the first positions of some leucine and arginine codons can also be synonymously mutated. For each mutable position, sequences were produced in which every possible synonymous mutation was made. The GeRM scores of all 5-mers that overlapped with the mutable position were calculated, and the maximum of these GeRM scores was taken for each possible mutation or the native sequence. Then, the maximum GeRM score associated with the 5-mers overlapping the native sequence was divided by the mean of the maximum GeRM scores associated with all possible mutations to create a ratio. When this ratio is positive, the native nucleotide at the mutable position is associated with higher GeRM than the other possible mutations that could exist at that position on average.

PhyloP conservation across 100 vertebrates and 470 mammals in hg38 coordinates were downloaded from the UCSC Golden Path. These values were converted into transcriptomic coordinates based on the single transcripts per genes that were used for GeRM calculation. Mutable positions were binned based on their GeRM codon ratio with the binning calculations being applied to each codon separately, such that each bin contained an equal proportion of each codon.

For raw conservation analysis, the average PhyloP conservation values of mutable positions in each GeRm codon ratio bin were used. For analysis of normalized conservation values, the PhyloP of mutable positions were normalized for each codon by subtracting the median conservation of that mutable position in that codon by the median conservation across all mutable positions of the same type. For example, the conservation value associated with one instance of the A in the codon CGA would be normalized by subtracting the median conservation of all As in CGA codons. Each normalized position was then further normalized by subtracting the PhyloP value of the middle position of the codon (in the previous example, the G in that specific instance of the CGA codon). Subtraction was used for normalization because PhyloP scores operate on a logarithmic scale.

For analysis of arginine codon usage in R-LCDs, all human LCDs were filtered for those that obtain at least 20% arginine residues. The proportion of each arginine codon in the respective coding regions was calculated. Pairwise correlations between arginine codon usages using Spearman's rank correlation. To define CG-rich and GA-rich codon groups, principal component analysis was performed based on the arginine codon usage for all R-LCDs, and the top and bottom third of LCDs based on the first principal component were defined as CG-rich and GA-rich R-LCDs, respectively.

For the definition of R-LCDs in different species, all CDSs for each species were downloaded from Ensembl and a single transcript per gene was identified according to the previously described approach. LCDs encoded by these sequences were defined as previously described, using the complexity threshold defined for the human proteome for each species. A full list of the species and annotation versions can be found in Supplementary Table 1.

Gene Ontology analyses were conducted using the topGO R package and using the weight01 algorithm to account for the topology of the Gene Ontology graph.

HeLa cells were obtained from Cell Science at The Francis Crick Institute and cultured in DMEM + GlutaMAX (Thermo Scientific) with 10% FBS and split every 3–4 days using TrypLE Express (Thermo Scientific). Low-passage, wild-type mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs; 129S8/B6 background) were obtained from the Genetic Modification Service at The Francis Crick Institute and cultured feeder free on Nunc cell culture dishes (Thermo Scientific) coated with 0.1% gelatin (ES-006-B, Millipore). mESCs were maintained in 2i media60, fed every day and split every 2–3 days using Accutase (A6964, Sigma). All cell lines were sourced from, authenticated by and mycoplasma tested at The Francis Crick Institute.

All cell transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer's instructions. Doxycycline induction was performed by changing cell culture media to fresh, pre-warmed media containing 100 ng ml−1 doxycycline. CLK-IN-T3 (SML2649, Sigma) was dissolved to 5 mM in DMSO. In experiments using CLK-IN-T3 treatments, control cells were treated with the equivalent volume of DMSO.

Double-stranded DNA fragments were ordered as gBlocks or eBlocks from IDT. Primers were ordered from Sigma-Aldrich. All PCRs utilized Q5 High-Fidelity Master Mix (NEB) or Phusion High-Fidelity Master Mix (NEB). Backbone plasmids were linearized via PCR followed by treatment with DpnI (NEB) before assembly with fragments using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly (NEB) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Phosphorylations and ligations were performed using T4 PNK kinase (NEB) and T4 DNA ligase (NEB). Assembly reactions were purified using magnetic SPRI beads (Mag-bind TotalPure NGS; Omega-Bio-tek) before DNA transformation into 5α competent Escherichia coli (NEB). All sequences were confirmed via Sanger sequencing (Source Bioscience). pTwist-AMP high-copy plasmid was purchased from Twist Bioscience and was used as a vector for all overexpression via transient transfection. Sequences of all LUC7L3 constructs can be found in Supplementary Table 5.

For the three additional R-MCD plasmids, the following regions of LUC7L3221–415, PRPF38B251–534 and SRSF11171–389 were fused to mGreenLantern and assembled into pTwist-CMV plasmid backbones.

Nuclear–cytoplasmic fractionation was carried out by trypsinizing whole cells and washing twice with PBS. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 200 µl cytoplasmic lysis buffer: 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.025% NP-40, 0.05% saponin and 1X cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Sigma). Cells were rotated at 4 °C for 10 min, pelleted and the supernatant was taken as the cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclear pellet was washed in 1 ml cytoplasmic lysis buffer for 3 min, then pelleted again. The supernatant was removed and the nuclei were lysed in 200 µl iCLIP lysis buffer61 to obtain nuclear fractions. All centrifugations were performed at 4 °C and at 300g for 3 min. All buffers were kept ice cold. For each fraction, 20 µl was used for western blotting to confirm the efficiency of the fractionation, which was stable across all samples (Extended Data Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 3). In all western blots, vinculin was used as a loading control (1:2,000; 700062, Thermo Scientific). Anti-phosphoepitope SR proteins (1:1,000; MABE50, Sigma) were used to detect SR phosphorylation changes.

RNA extractions were performed from cell pellets using the Maxwell RSC simplyRNA kit (Promega) using a Maxwell RSC Instrument (Promega).

For each sample, 250 ng µl−1 of RNA was fragmented in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 10 mM MgCl2 buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. Of fragmented RNA, 2 µl was mixed with 2 µl water, 0.5 µl of 10 mM dNTPs and 0.5 µl of 5 µM of oligo-dT reverse transcription primers containing Illumina P7 sequences, and primers were annealed by heating at 65 °C for 3 min then cooling to 42 °C at 1 °C per second. At this point, reverse transcription was carried out using SuperScript IV (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions, with the addition of 0.25 µl of 40 µM of a template-switching oligo containing Illumina P5 sequences and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). The reaction was incubated for 1 h at 42 °C. Following alkaline hydrolysis of RNA, the product was purified using magnetic SPRI beads and amplified using 0.5 µM i5/i7 Illumina indexed primers in Q5 High-Fidelity Master Mix (NEB).

All sequencing data were mapped to the GRCh38.p12 genome using the GENCODE v29 basic genome annotation. All 3′ end sequencing data were trimmed using cutadapt (v4.4)62 to remove poly-A sequences and Illumina adapters. All data were processed using the nf-core RNA-seq Nextflow pipeline (v3.12.0)63, and in the case of the 3′ end sequencing data, the additional option --noLengthCorrection was provided to Salmon to prevent length correction for gene expression.

Differential expression analysis was conducted using DESeq2 in R64, with effect size shrinkage using the apeglm package65. Changes in the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio between two conditions were assessed using the interaction term of the models (fraction × time). Splicing analysis was conducted using rMATS (v4.1.2)66 using the skipped exons calculated using the JCEC quantifications.

To classify genes based on their degree of GA multivalency, a GA-multivalency score was calculated for each gene based on the CDS of its primary transcript, defined by the longest annotated CDS, with ties settled by total transcript length. First, for each of the three previously identified GA-rich GeRM clusters (A-rich and G-rich AG, AG + C), representative k-mers were derived as described in the section ‘Identification and classification of GeRM regions'. Then, raw multivalency scores of 5-mers were scaled to all other instances of the same 5-mer, such that their mean score was 0 and their standard deviation was 1. For each transcript, the sum of all these scaled GeRM scores was summed across all representative 5-mers. On the basis of this metric, transcripts that have many instances of GA-rich 5-mers specifically in multivalent contexts are rewarded. All processed data from 3′ end sequencing experiments can be found in Supplementary Table 4.

Cells were grown for 48 h in lysine-free and arginine-free DMEM (Thermo Scientific), supplemented with 10% dialysed FBS (Thermo Scientific), 600 mg l−1 proline and 100 mg l−1 arginine and lysine (‘light' media). Cells were induced with 500 ng ml−1 doxycycline for 12 h before switching to either medium arginine 13C6 (88210, Thermo Scientific) and lysine 4,4,5,5-D4 (DLM-2640, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories; ‘medium' media) or heavy arginine 13C6 15N4 (89990, Thermo Scientific) and lysine 13C6 15N2 (88209, Thermo Scientific; ‘heavy' media) for 8 h. Media were refreshed every 2 h, with doxycycline treatment maintained throughout.

Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 4% SDS, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma). Samples were next sonicated, and their protein concentrations quantified via DC protein assay (Bio-Rad).

Lysates were reduced by the addition of dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 5 mM, vortexed briefly and incubated at 56 °C for 30 min. Samples were cooled to room temperature and alkylated with iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 20 mM. Following brief vortexing and incubation in the dark at room temperature for 20 min, residual iodoacetamide was quenched with 5 mM dithiothreitol for 10 min. Trypsin was added at a 1:100 enzyme:substrate ratio. Samples were vortexed, centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 rpm and incubated overnight at 37 °C shaking at 750 rpm.

Peptide samples (1 µg on column) were analysed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). Chromatographic separation was performed using the U3000 UHPLC NanoLC system (Thermo Scientific) and peptides were resolved by reversed phase chromatography on a 75-µm C18 Pepmap column (50 cm length) via a three-step linear gradient comprising 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. The gradient was delivered to elute peptides at a flow rate of 250 nl min−1 over 120 min, initially at 4% solvent at 0–10 min, then increasing to 30% solvent (10–75 min) and 40% solvent at 75–80 min. This was followed by a wash step with 99% solvent (85–90 min) and a final equilibration step with 4% solvent (90–120 min).

Peptides were ionized by electrospray via an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) operating under Xcalibur (v4.3). Data were acquired in data-dependent acquisition mode using an Orbitrap-Ion Trap method with a 3-s cycle time between a full MS scan and MS/MS fragmentation by collision-induced dissociation. Orbitrap spectra were collected at 120,000 resolution over an m/z range of 350–1,600, with an automatic gain control of 4.0 × 105 (100%) and maximum injection time of 35 ms. Monoisotropic precursor selection was enabled for charge states +2 to +5 with an intensity threshold of 5 × 103–1 × 1020 and dynamic exclusion of 35 s ± 10 ppm. MS2 precursor ions were isolated in the quadrupole with a mass width filter of 1.6 m/z. Ion trap fragmentation spectra were collected with an automatic gain control target setting of 1.0 × 104 (100%) with a maximum injection time of 35 ms with collision-induced dissociation collision energy set at 35%.

Raw mass spectrometry data were processed into peak list files using Proteome Discoverer (v3.1; Thermo Scientific) and searched with the Sequest algorithm67 against the Uniprot Human isoform database (188,476 entries; September 2024). This was concatenated with the mScarlet fluorescent protein sequence. Database searching was performed at a stringency of 1% FDR including a decoy search with precursor ion intensity quantification. Post-translational modifications to amino acid residues included carbamidomethylation (C) and variable oxidation (M), SILAC 13C6 (R) and SILAC 2H42 (K).

The proportion of SILAC-labelled peptides for each protein was compared between doxycycline-treated and untreated samples to determine the change in translation or protein turnover. The mean log2 fold change for all proteins belonging to different multivalency classes in each replicate was calculated and this per-replicate mean was used for pairwise significance testing. The proportion of the total proteome or total R-MCD abundance attributed to mScarlet–PPIGLCD overexpression was calculated using the peptides assigned to mScarlet, and R-MCDs were classified as previously defined R-LCDs (those containing at least 20% arginine), with the additional constraint that the net charge must be positive and the total fraction of charged residues in the LCD must be greater than 40%.

Immunofluorescence was performed by fixing cells in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glyoxal at room temperature for 10 min. Samples were permeabilized by incubating with PBS with 0.5% Triton-X for 5 min at room temperature. Samples were blocked using PBS with 3% BSA and 0.1% Tween (blocking solution). Primary antibody incubations were carried out in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Samples were washed three times with PBS with 0.1% Tween for 5 min, and secondary antibody incubations were carried out in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Samples were washed twice, then incubated with 200 ng ml−1 DAPI for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. DAPI was washed out and samples were placed in glycerol mounting medium (90% glycerol, 20 mM Tris pH 8 and PBS).

The following antibodies were used at the following concentrations: rabbit anti-TRA2B (1:1,000; ab31353, abcam), rabbit anti-SON (1:1,000; HPA023535, Sigma) and mouse anti-SC35 (1:500; S4045, Sigma). Secondary antibodies to mouse and rabbit, conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 647 were used at 1:500 dilution (Abcam). This included goat pAb anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 647 (ab150079), goat pAb anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (ab150077), goat pAb anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (ab150113) and goat pAb anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 647 (ab150115).

For each mRNA, HCR 12 probe pairs were designed with the B4 amplifier sequences using the HCR 3.0 Probe Maker68. HCR 3.0 was performed on cells in µ-Slide eight-well glass bottom slides (80827, Ibidi) as described in the original protocol69, with the following modifications. First, fixation and permeabilization was performed as described in the immunofluorescence section. After pre-hybridization, primary probe hybridization was performed with a probe concentration of 10 nM for 3 h. Overnight HCR amplification was performed in a volume of 125 µl with half the concentration of HCR hairpins (Molecular Instruments). Following HCR amplification, samples were washed according to the original protocol, and then immunofluorescence was performed as previously described, but with all buffers containing 2XSSC in place of PBS.

In all cases of R-MCD overexpression transfections, HCR-FISH was performed on HeLa cells 24 h post-transfection with 50 ng of mGreenLantern-fused R-MCD plasmid, in combination with 200 ng of pUC19 filler DNA.

Samples for oligo-d(T) FISH were fixed as described for immunofluorescence. Samples were incubated with HCR 3.0 hybridization buffer for 30 min at 37 °C, then in hybridization buffer containing 1 µg ml−1 oligo-dT(25)-Cy5 for 2 h. Samples were washed twice in 5XSSC with 0.1% Tween, stained with 200 ng ml−1 DAPI in the same buffer and washed once more before glycerol mounting medium was added.

Microscope images were acquired using an Olympus IX3 Series (IX83) inverted microscope, equipped with a Yokogawa W1 spinning disk and a Hamamatsu Orca Fusion CMOS camera (pixel size of 6.5 μm, 2,304 × 2304, 5.3 megapixels).

All images were z-projected using a maximum projection. Segmentation of nuclei and cytoplasms was performed using Cellpose (v2.0)70 using the cyto2 model. Segmentation of nuclear speckles was performed using CellProfiler using the Otsu thresholding algorithm, and nucleoplasms were considered all non-speckle regions of the nucleus. The mean signal intensity for HCR-FISH or immunofluorescence within speckles was compared with the mean intensity in the nucleoplasm for each cell to create a speckle enrichment ratio. Mean intensities in the nucleoplasm and nuclear speckle were calculated per cell, but statistical comparisons between groups counted each replicate as a single observation, taking the mean values across all cells in the replicate.

Using predictive modelling, we aimed to evaluate the contribution of CDS length, EJC density and different types of multivalent features on nuclear retention of endogenous transcripts in interstasis. To disentangle the contributions of the different multivalent features, we first cleaned the data to reduce collinearities. Representative k-mers were assigned for each of the eight GeRM clusters as described in the section ‘Identification and classification of GeRM regions'. Subsequently, k-mers belonging to multiple clusters were retained only in the cluster to which they contributed the highest proportion of multivalency, ensuring no k-mers overlapped between clusters.

Next, the raw k-mer multivalencies for all k-mers belonging to a cluster were summed across CDSs of representative transcripts, defined as the transcript with the longest CDS per gene, and normalized by CDS length. These length-normalized multivalency sums were then standard scaled across the transcriptome so that the mean transcriptome-wide multivalency of each GeRM cluster was zero. We assessed the correlations between the multivalencies of the eight GeRM clusters and found a high correlation among the C-rich, CUG-repeat, G-rich, G/C and GA + C multivalent classes. Given this high correlation and the similarity of their k-mers, we combined these clusters into a single GC-rich cluster for training. We repeated the scoring with the combined k-mers from all these clusters. This approach efficiently minimized collinearities between features, except for a moderate anti-correlation (Spearman's r = −0.75) between the GC-rich and A-rich clusters. Features used for training are summarized in Supplementary Table 8.

Then, we trained a classification model to differentiate between mRNAs retained in the nucleus after PPIGLCD induction and control mRNAs that did not show a significant change in their nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio under these conditions. mRNAs were classified as retained if they had a q < 0.05 and a log2 fold change greater than 1 at 12 h post-PPIGLCD induction, resulting in 275 transcripts. Control mRNAs were defined by a q ≥ 0.05 and a log2 fold change between −0.1 and 0.1, yielding 1,697 transcripts.

Owing to significant imbalance between the positive (nuclear retained) and the negative (control) class, we used a BalancedRandomForestClassifier from imbalanced-learn module (v0.12.3)71, leveraging sampling of the majority class to balance the classes in the process of training (sampling_strategy = ‘not minority'). The classifier was configured with 100 trees (n_estimators = 100) and used bootstrap sampling with replacement to enhance generalization. Gini impurity criterion was used for node splitting and the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node was set to 15. For evaluation of the classifier's performance, we used fourfold stratified cross-validation. This method splits the data into fourfolds, with each fold serving as a test set once while the remaining threefolds serve as the training set. Stratified k-fold cross-validation ensures that each of the folds maintains the same proportion of positive and negative samples as the entire dataset, thereby preventing skewed performance metrics. In this case, the model was trained four times, with each training set comprising 75% of the data and each test set comprising 25%, ensuring balanced class representation in both training and testing. Visualized AUROC metrics were averaged across folds to obtain a robust estimate of the classifier's performance.

To identify the optimal set of input features and assess their effect on predictive performance, we used a stepwise feature-selection approach. Initially, we trained models with individual features and progressively expanded the feature set, by selecting the best-performing single feature or feature combination and adding the remaining features on top of it. This process was repeated until adding more features no longer enhanced the performance of the model. All models were evaluated using fourfold cross-validation, as described.

The mScarlet–PPIGLCD library was designed by concatenating the CDSs for mScarlet and PPIG402–684. The concatenated sequence was then iteratively synonymously mutated such that the GC content of the sequence was maintained within 2% of the original sequence, choosing codons with fewer As and Gs until the number of AG-only 5-mers reached a minimum. Untranslated regions were added to this sequence. Seven equally spaced sequences of 28 nt were chosen along the sequence to be used as overlap sequences for future Gibson assembly. These overlap sequences were protected from future in silico mutagenesis.

Twenty-six constitutively spliced introns ranging from 83 nt to 384 nt in length were selected from housekeeping genes. We generated 25 different combinations by randomly choosing 8 of these introns, then performed the following iterative optimization algorithm to each of these 25 combinations to generate sequences with optimized predicted splicing.

First, introns were inserted in the reporter CDS in positions that were exactly between the previously defined overlap sequences or the start and end codons. The probability of donor and acceptor site usage was predicted using SpliceAI, and all probabilities were summed. Next, 100 coding sequences with 5 random synonymous mutations were generated, and a sequence was selected that best maintained GC content and kept GA 5-mer content low. After this, an intronic sequence was selected with a 80% chance to be mutated at 5% of its positions and a 50% chance to be shifted by up to 20 nt. The probability of donor and acceptor site usage in the new sequence was predicted with SpliceAI, and the sum of the probabilities was compared with the previous sequence. If the total probability of splice site usage was increased in the mutated sequence, then the mutated sequence was put forwards for another round of mutation, until 2,000 iterations were completed.

To create a GA-rich version of the reporter CDS, the iterative process was repeated, but with synonymous mutations that maintained GC content but maximized GA-rich 5-mer content. The sequence and position of the introns were kept constant for this process.

To determine which of the 25 possible combinations of 8 introns resulted in the best-predicted splicing in both GA-poor and GA-rich reporter sequences, we selected the intron set with the highest summed probability of predicted donor and acceptor site usage. This resulted in GA-poor and GA-rich codon-biased reporter sequences in which both splice sites for each of the eight introns was predicted to have at least a 98.5% probability of being spliced.

For both the GA-rich and the GA-poor sequence, eight sequence segments were generated that spanned from each overlap sequence to the next (or to the untranslated region) and that either contained an intronic sequence or not. Therefore, each of the eight segments of the final reporter gene varied in two possible ways: GA richness and the presence or absence of an intron, and each of these variable segments shared a fixed overlap sequence with the neighbouring segment.

All 32 possible segment variations were ordered as double-stranded DNA fragments from IDT. In addition to the overlap sequences that would be part of the final reporter transcript, additional overlap sequences were added for intermediate assembly steps. Specifically, an overlap sequence was added to the 3′ end of the first segment and to the 5′ of the last segment, and another overlap sequence was added to the 3′ ends of the first and fifth segments and the 5′ ends of the fourth and last segment. Then, two pools containing all variations of the first four segments or all variations of the last four segments were made, such that intron-containing variants had twice the molarity of intronless variants at each position, but all positions had the same overall molarity. A Gibson assembly reaction was carried out on each pool, and due to the additional overlaps on the first, fourth, fifth and final segments, circular pieces of double-stranded DNA were formed, each containing one of the four variations at each of the four positions used for that pool.

These circular pieces of DNA were then linearized and amplified by PCR, and the linearized fragments deriving from the first and second half of the reporter gene were again Gibson assembled together. Again, because of the additional overlap sequences attached to the first and last segments, the resulting assemblies were circular. Each assembly contained a 5′ UTR, a CDS encoding mScarlet–PPIGLCD but with a variable amount of GA-rich 5-mers and a variable number of introns, and a 3′ UTR. These assemblies were then linearized and amplified by PCR and Gibson assembled into a plasmid backbone (pTwist-CMV) containing a CMV promoter and a barcoded 3′ UTR sequence with a poly-adenylation site. Therefore, the plasmids in the pool contained different versions of the reporter gene, each with a unique barcode in their 3′ UTR.

After each reaction, the product was purified using Mag-Bind TotalPure beads. All PCRs were performed using Q5 High-Fidelity Master Mix (NEB). All Gibson assemblies were performed using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly (NEB).

To generate a doxycycline-inducible PiggyBac integration vector containing the reporter library (ePB-ExportReporter), reporter genes and their barcoded UTRs were amplified out of the original reporter plasmid library with a low number of PCR cycles, before being inserted into an all-in-one PiggyBac plasmid (ePB-Bsd-TT-NIL) containing a doxycycline-inducible promoter as well as a constitutive promoter driving the expression of the rtTA protein and blasticidin resistance gene. All designed fragments, as well as example reporter sequences and plasmids, are provided in Supplementary Table 2.

For sequencing of the plasmid pool, the reporter genes were amplified from the plasmid DNA with a minimal number of PCR cycles. For sequencing of the reporter RNA, one well of a six-well plate of HeLa cells were transfected with 500 ng of the reporter plasmid pool and 2,000 ng of a filler pUC19 plasmid for 16 h. RNA was extracted and 500 ng of total RNA was used as input for a SuperScript IV reverse transcription (Invitrogen) reaction using an oligo-dT reverse transcription following the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction was purified with magnetic beads, then amplified according to the same approach as for the plasmid DNA. The specificity of the amplicon was confirmed with an agarose gel. In both cases, the PCR product was purified with magnetic beads (Mag-bind TotalPure NGS, Omega-Bio-tek) and Nanopore adapters were added using the Nanopore Ligation Sequencing Kit (Oxford Nanopore), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The libraries were sequenced separately using MinION R9.4.1 Flow Cells (Oxford Nanopore).

Raw Nanopore data were basecalled with Guppy (v6.0.1). The basecalled reads were mapped to a genome of possible reporter transcripts using minimap2 (ref. 72), and barcodes were extracted by matching the upstream and downstream sequences using the R package stringdist73.

Targeted sequencing libraries were prepared from 500 ng of RNA input per sample. A targeted reverse transcription was performed with SuperScript IV (Invitrogen) using a reverse transcription primer that was specific to the reporter 3′ UTR and contained a 4-nt experimental barcode, a 10-nt UMI and an Illumina p7 adapter sequence. The reaction was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Samples were multiplexed in groups of six at this point, and the RNA was removed by alkaline hydrolysis for 15 min, the pH was neutralized with hydrochloric acid, and the cDNA was purified with magnetic beads. A nested PCR was then performed in which ten cycles with one set of primers was performed. Of the reaction, 5% was spiked into the next six-cycle reaction, in which an Illumina p5 adapter sequence was added. The PCR was purified with magnetic beads (Mag-bind TotalPure NGS, Omega-Bio-tek), and Illumina i5 and i7 indices were added by a final PCR. Libraries were sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 by the Advanced Sequencing Facility at The Francis Crick Institute. All primer sequences can be found in Supplementary Table 2.

Targeted sequencing libraries were analysed in R. Libraries were demultiplexed using the barcodes introduced by the reverse transcription primer, and the plasmid barcode was extracted by matching the flanking constant regions using fuzzy string matching using the R package stringdist. Reads containing the same barcode were deduplicated by their UMI sequences. Barcodes were counted and related to their reporter gene characteristics based on the long-read sequencing data. Barcode counts were normalized to the total number of assigned barcodes for each sample. Barcodes with low numbers of counts were excluded from further analysis. Nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios for each barcode were calculated for each replicate. All processed data for each experiment can be found in Supplementary Table 3.

We cloned the reporter pool into a doxycycline-inducible PiggyBac vector and generated the PiggyBac cell lines by co-transfecting HeLa cells with equal amounts of the ePB-ExportReporter plasmid pool and a plasmid expressing the PiggyBac transposase. A transposase-negative control was also prepared. Cells were selected once with 5 µg ml−1 blasticidin for 4 days, then expanded for 1 week, before being selected again with blasticidin until all cells in the transposase-negative control were dead. This pool of ePB-ExportReporter-positive cells was then expanded and stocks were frozen.

To understand which RBPs have the potential to bind to GA-multivalent reporters with high affinity, we designed a ‘binding potential' score, based on RBP-binding motifs obtained with the RNA-Bind-N-Seq method. We downloaded enrichment scores (R scores) for 78 RBPs published by Dominguez et al.30, and for TRA2B32 from the ENCODE portal, yielding motifs for 79 distinct RBPs. Accession codes and relevant concentrations of RNA-Bind-N-Seq experiments are specified in the supplementary material of the original publication (see supplementary table 3 in ref. 30). The R scores for the RBP concentration that yielded the highest motif enrichment were converted to z scores using mean and standard deviation. A tail test was then applied to compute P values, and motifs with a P < 0.05 were selected for further analysis.

To evaluate the reporter sequences in terms of RBP-binding potential, we divided their CDSs into 5-mers using a rolling window of 5 nt. We then counted the 5-mers that were labelled as significant for a given RBP and multiplied the count for each significant 5-mer by its z score. The values obtained were summed into a single score for each RBP (Fig. 5h). The binding potential scores for all evaluated RBPs and reporter sequences can be found in Supplementary Table 9.

All public CLIP data were processed as previously described74, with replicates merged. All crosslinks falling within CDS per sample were counted and the proportion of CDSs to total crosslinks was calculated. Samples in the bottom third were excluded. Remaining samples in the bottom third of raw CDS crosslink counts were also excluded, to remove low-quality datasets. To determine whether a protein tends to bind to RNA in multivalent contexts, the percentile of the GeRM score was calculated for each possible 5-mer in all CDSs. For each crosslink in each sample, the mean GeRM percentile of each crosslinked 5-mer was calculated. If a given 5-mer is crosslinked preferentially in multivalent contexts (relative to the average multivalency of that 5-mer), then the mean GeRM percentile will be high. The mean 5-mer GeRM percentiles for the top 50 most crosslinked 5-mers was compared with all other 5-mers, producing a ratio. This ratio represents the general bias of a protein to bind its preferred motifs in a multivalent context. In the examples shown in Extended Data Fig. 8i,j, this ratio is the mean y axis position for the 50 right-most points on the x axis over the mean y axis position of all other points. Only samples with a ratio of at least 1.1, implying a preference for multivalent motifs, were kept for further analysis.

Only transcripts in the top half of total crosslinks per nucleotide in the CDS across all samples were used for further analysis, as samples with a low crosslinking density typically did not contain enough crosslinks per GeRM region to produce meaningful results. For each GeRM region, the ratio of the number of crosslinks falling within that GeRM region compared with the rest of the CDS for that transcript was calculated. The mean of this ratio within each GeRM cluster was calculated for each sample. Samples were then hierarchically clustered and plotted as a heatmap (Fig. 5a).

iCLIP was performed according to the iiCLIP protocol61, using crosslinked cell lysate containing 1.5 mg of protein per sample. Two replicates were prepared for each CLIP target. For immunoprecipitation, 5 µg anti-TRA2B (ab31353, abcam) was used. Membrane transfer was performed overnight at 4 °C with reduced voltage (15 V). The entire lane was cut from 40 kDa upwards.

CLIP libraries were trimmed and demultiplexed using Ultraplex75 and mapped to a small RNA genome containing all rRNA, small nuclear RNA, tRNA and small nucleolar RNA sequences from GENCODE vM22 using STAR (v2.7.0)76. All unmapped reads were then mapped uniquely to the genome using STAR, with the transcriptome-mapping reads output using the flag --quantMode TranscriptomeSAM, and the 5′ end of the read was forced to be aligned using the flag --alignEndsType Extend5pOfRead1. Reads were demultiplexed using UMItools77. Crosslink sites were defined as the position immediately upstream of the read.

Metaprofiles around different GeRM regions were created by taking the midpoint of each GeRM region and counting the transcriptome-mapped crosslinks in each position relative to the midpoint. All counts were summed across GeRM regions of the same cluster, then normalized by the number of GeRM regions within the cluster and the number of millions of unique transcriptome-mapping crosslinks in each sample.

For siRNA-induced double TRA2 knockdowns, 100 nM of ON-TARGETplus siRNA pools, consisting of four siRNAs targeting both TRA2A (LQ-019480-00-0005, Dharmacon) and TRA2B (LQ-007278-00-0005, Dharmacon), were transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer's reverse transfection protocol. Transfections with a 100 nM scrambled non-targeting control pool (D-001810-10-05, Dharmacon) were carried out in parallel. Thirty-six hours after transfection, doxycycline was added to the transfection media to induce mScarlet–PPIGLCD expression over a period of 12 h. A total of 48 h post-transfection, cells were either fixed for HCR-FISH as previously described or collected for western blotting to confirm efficient knockdown of TRA2A (1:500; H00029896-B01P, Novus Biologicals) and TRA2B. This was quantified via ImageStudio 5.x Odyssey Clx (LI-COR).

For each sample, a single well of a six-well plate of ePB-ER HeLa cells was transfected with one of the mGreenLantern LUC7L3-LCD reporter plasmids in which the LUC7L3 sequence was used as a 3′ UTR but was either GA rich or GA poor. Doxycycline was added to the medium at the point of transfection. Four replicates were performed for each plasmid, as well as untransfected and uninduced controls. After 16 h, the cells were dissociated, washed twice with ice-cold PBS and kept on ice while the samples were measured with an LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences). The intensities of mGreenLantern and mScarlet were measured using a 488-nm blue laser (Coherent Sapphire 100 mW) with a 530/30-nm filter, and a 561-nm yellow green laser (Coherent Sapphire 100 mW) with a 610/20-nm filter, respectively.

Gating of singlets was performed using FlowJo, and subsequent analysis was performed in R. For each plasmid, the mGreenLantern intensities were normalized to the mean intensity values of the uninduced control samples. Cells were binned according to their mScarlet intensity values, and the mean mGreenLantern intensity values for all cells in each bin were calculated per replicate.

All statistics were performed in R (v4.2.0). All tests were two-tailed when possible. All pairwise comparisons were made using a Welch t-test unless otherwise stated. When appropriate, P values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure.

a, An example of a transcript from the gene CCDC61. The smoothed GeRM score is shown along the transcript in the upper panel (solid line), with the dashed line depicting the average smoothed GeRM score after synonymous codon shuffling. The amino acid entropy of the encoded sequence is shown in the lower panel (black line), while the proportion of charged amino acids in that window is shown in the orange line. b, The native DNA and amino acid sequences of CCDC61 within the GeRM peak. A codon shuffled sequence in which all codons must be synonymously shifted is shown. The conservation across 100 vertebrates (PhyloP) for each position that can tolerate synonymous mutation is shown, with the height of the letter corresponding to the PhyloP score. Below, a ratio is shown that compares the GeRM scores associated with the native codon choice to the GeRM scores associated with any possible synonymous mutation. c, a schematic detailing the calculation of the ratio of GeRM between native codon choices and synonymous mutations. d, the mean log2-transformed ratio for each type of possible synonymous mutation. For example, for the arginine codon CGG, position 1 is considered a synonymously mutable position (CGG -> AGG) and position 3 is considered separately as a mutable position (e.g CGG -> CGC). Relative codon usage is calculated by scaling the transcriptomic codon usage such that the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. e, The normalised conservation across 470 mammals of synonymously mutable positions in coding sequences that either encode LCDs or do not. Codons are binned by the degree that the native codon choice supports sequence multivalency, where codons with the highest ratio support the multivalency the most. Conservation values are normalised to the middle position of the codon, which is never synonymously mutable, and each codon is normalised to have a median conservation value of 0. f, PhyloP scores across 100 vertebrates of the middle positions of codons inside or outside of LCDs. g, As in Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 1e, but using unnormalised PhyloP scores across 100 vertebrates. h, The mean GeRM scores within CDS regions encoding LCDs (black lines), or the rest of the CDS (grey lines). The mean GeRM scores in those regions after synonymously reordering the codons within each transcript (dashed lines) Unless otherwise stated, pairwise significance testing are FDR-corrected Welch t-tests, where * = p < 1−15. Precise p-values are found in Source Data.

Only amino acids with notable enrichments are shown. c, The number of GeRM regions per cluster encoding at least two-fold more arginines than expected based on occurrence in the proteome. d, The mean amino acid entropy calculated in sliding windows for amino acids encoded by different GeRM regions or the amino acid sequences encoded by the rest of the CDS (grey line). The dashed line represents the mean amino acid entropy for the entire proteome. Statistical comparisons are Welch t-tests between the GeRM regions and the non-GeRM regions from the same set of proteins, with FDR correction. e, The log2-transformed ratio between the total GeRM calculated from the native sequence within a GeRM region and the mean total GeRM score in the same region when codons have been synonymously shuffled five times within each transcript. Statistical tests are one sample t-tests, with FDR correction.

R-LCDs are categorised into three groups of equal size using the first principal component. b, The codon usage of the groups of R-LCDs defined in panel a. c, The representation of amino acids within the groups of R-LCDs defined in panel a. d-e, The codon usage of R-LCDs from genes with either ‘nuclear speck' or ‘RNA binding' gene ontology terms compared to R-LCDs without those annotations. f, The proportion of charged amino acids within the R-LCD categories defined in panel a. g, The percentage of proteins containing at least one R-LCD in different species. h, the percentage of LCDs that contain at least 20% arginine in different species. i, the Spearman's rank correlations of codon usage within R-LCDs in different species. Pairwise significance testing are FDR-corrected Welch t-tests, where * = p < 0.05, ** = p < 0.01, *** = p < 0.001. Precise p-values are found in Source Data.

Elucidating the complex network of communication between tumour cells is central to understanding cell fate decisions and progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)1,2. We previously showed that constant suppression of BMP activity by the BMP antagonist GREM1 secreted by mesenchymal PDAC cells is essential for maintaining the fate of epithelial PDAC cells3. Here we identify SPP1 (also known as osteopontin)4 as a key regulator of mesenchymal cell fate in pancreatic cancer. Proteomic analysis of plasma from patients with PDAC showed that SPP1 is substantially upregulated in late-stage disease. Inactivation of Spp1 led to a delay in tumorigenesis in mouse PDAC models and abolished metastasis formation. Spp1 was expressed in epithelial PDAC cells, and Spp1 inactivation resulted in a conversion of mesenchymal to epithelial PDAC cells. Mechanistically, SPP1 bound the CD61 receptor on mesenchymal PDAC cells to induce Bmp2 and Grem1 expression, and GREM1 inhibition of BMP signalling was required for Spp1 expression in epithelial cells, thereby forming an intercellular regulatory loop. Concomitant inactivation of Grem1 reverted the epithelial phenotype of Spp1 knockout to fully mesenchymal PDAC. Conversely, Grem1 heterozygosity combined with Spp1 knockout resulted in wild-type PDAC histology, a result that confirmed the direct antagonistic functions of these factors. Hence, mesenchymal and epithelial PDAC cell fates are determined by the reciprocal paracrine regulation of the soluble factors GREM1 and SPP1.

PDAC is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with a 5-year relative survival rate of only 13%5. To identify factors that control the progression of pancreatic cancer, we compared protein levels in the plasma of patients with early-stage (stage I or II) or late-stage (stage III or IV) PDAC (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). The abundance of SPP1 was significantly increased at late stages (Fig. 1b). SPP1 plasma levels were also increased in Pdx1-cre;KrasLSL-G12D/+;Trp53fl/fl;Rosa26LSL-YFP (KPCY) mice, a commonly used mouse model of PDAC6, compared with wild-type (WT) animals (Fig. 1c).

To explore the role of SPP1 in the development and progression of pancreatic cancer, we first analysed single-cell sequencing data from public databases. Cancer cell populations with high SPP1 expression had significantly higher levels of genes involved in the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature7,8 than populations with low SPP1 expression (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c). Moreover, by analysing publicly available transcriptome data of 644 patients with pancreatic cancer, we observed that patients with high SPP1 expression exhibited significant enrichment of the hallmark EMT gene set8. Accordingly, these patients showed worse prognosis compared with those with low SPP1 expression (Extended Data Fig. 1d–f). Together, these results suggest that SPP1 is a regulator of EMT in pancreatic cancer.

Immunofluorescence staining of KPCY tumours revealed that SPP1 was predominantly expressed in epithelial PDAC cells (EPCs) and not in vimentin (VIM)-positive mesenchymal PDAC cells (MPCs) (Fig. 1d). To understand SPP1 function, we established organoids from tumours of Pdx1-Flp;KrasFSF-G12D/+;Trp53frt/frt;Vim-GFP (KPFV) mice9, which enabled the differentiation between EPCs and MPCs on the basis of GFP fluorescence (Extended Data Fig. 1g). We performed Spp1 knockout in KPFV organoids using CRISPR–Cas9 technology (Extended Data Fig. 1h). The VIM–GFP+ MPC population was abolished after Spp1 knockout (Fig. 1e), which suggested that Spp1 is required for MPC fate. Quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT–qPCR) analysis showed a marked decrease in expression of the mesenchymal markers Vim, Fn1 and S100a4, concomitant with a notable increase in the epithelial markers Krt19, Cdh1 and Epcam10 (Fig. 1f). In line with this result, there were fewer allograft tumours generated from Pdx1-Flp;KrasFSF-G12D/+;Trp53frt/frt (KPF) organoids deficient in SPP1 (Spp1Δ/Δ KPF), and the tumours were small and consisted almost exclusively of EPCs. By contrast, tumours formed from control KPF organoids contained both EPC and MPC populations (Fig. 1g,h and Extended Data Fig. 1i,j). Furthermore, Spp1 overexpression in organoids from LSL-KrasG12D/+;LSL-Trp53R172H/+;Pdx-1-Cre (KPR172H/+C) mice induced mesenchymal differentiation of PDAC cells (Extended Data Fig. 2a–d). Notably, these phenotypes were also observed in human PDAC organoids and xenografts with SPP1 knocked out or overexpressed (Extended Data Fig. 3a–o). Thus, SPP1 produced by EPCs is required for the maintenance of MPCs in both mouse and human PDAC.

Several receptors have been identified as receptors for SPP1, including the integrin CD61 (encoded by Itgb3)11,12,13. Immunofluorescence staining of KPCY tumours showed a markedly complementary expression pattern of SPP1 and CD61, and CD61 was predominantly expressed in MPCs (Fig. 2a). To further investigate the relationship between SPP1 and CD61, we performed CRISPR–Cas9-mediated knockout of Itgb3 in KPFV organoids (Extended Data Fig. 4a). VIM–GFP+ cells were not observed in Itgb3-deficient KPFV organoids, which also had a significant reduction in mesenchymal marker expression (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 4b). Furthermore, allograft formation was significantly reduced (Fig. 2d,e), and the proportion of MPCs was decreased in Itgb3-deficient allografts (Fig. 2f,g). Thus, Itgb3 knockout phenocopies Spp1 knockout (Fig. 1e–g), a result that strongly suggests that SPP1 functions through CD61.

We next investigated the potential function of SPP1 in PDAC progression. We combined PDAC induced by the Flp/Frt recombination system (KPF mice)14 with a floxed Spp1 (Spp1fl) allele, a Flp-inducible Rosa26FSF-creER allele14 that allows Spp1 deletion in the pancreatic parenchyma during tumour development and a Tomato/GFP-Cre reporter allele15 to generate compound Pdx1-Flp;KrasFSF-G12D/+;Trp53frt/frt;R26FSF-creER;R26mTmG;Spp1fl/fl (Spp1fl/fl KPFCT) mice (Fig. 3a).

Tamoxifen was administered to 25-day-old animals to inactivate Spp1 in PDAC tumours. Histology of Spp1-deficent tumours showed a notable increase in epithelial structures (Fig. 3b), and immunofluorescence analysis revealed that PDAC tumours contained a marked increase in EPCs (KRT19+VIM–) and a substantial decrease in MPCs (KRT19–VIM+) compared with control KPFCT tumours (Fig. 3c,d). Notably, Spp1fl/fl KPFCT tumours exhibited a considerable reduction in cancer-associated fibroblasts (Extended Data Fig. 4c–f). However, despite the reduction in cancer-associated fibroblasts, the degree of immune infiltration was unchanged (Extended Data Fig. 4g–n). An increase in MPCs is known as a crucial factor that leads to poor prognosis in patients with PDAC16,17. Accordingly, Spp1fl/fl KPFCT mice with tumours exhibited significantly increased survival compared with control KPFCT mice (Fig. 3e). Moreover, the absence of Spp1 also substantially reduced PDAC development in the KPCY model, with a substantial percentage of Spp1-deficient animals surviving more than 400 days (Fig. 3f).

EMT is as an important mechanism of tumour metastasis formation18. To investigate the impact of Spp1 on PDAC metastasis, we used (Pdx1-Flp;KrasFSF-G12D/+;Trp53WT/frt;R26FSF-creER;R26mTmG) KPhetFCT mice, because the heterozygosity of Trp53 means that there is a longer latency period in the formation of the tumour, which enables metastases to form and disseminate3. Ultrasound imaging showed that most mice developed tumours at around 100 days of age. Therefore, tamoxifen was administered at this point, and tumour progression and metastasis formation were monitored (Fig. 3g). Consistent with Spp1fl/fl KPFCT mice, Spp1fl/fl KPhetFCT mice (which have Spp1 knocked out) had tumours that predominantly comprised EPCs, whereas KPhetFCT mice (with WT Spp1) formed tumours with both EPCs and MPCs (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). In KPhetFCT mice, liver metastases were detected in 23% of animals and 30% had lung metastases. By contrast, Spp1fl/fl KPhetFCT mice had no metastases in the liver or lung (Fig. 3g–i and Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). Furthermore, orthotopic transplantation of Spp1-overexpressing KPR172H/+C organoids significantly promoted liver and lung metastases (Extended Data Fig. 6a–f). By contrast, in vivo administration of a SPP1-blocking antibody reduced MPC cell fate and suppressed liver and lung metastases (Extended Data Fig. 7a–j). Taken together, these data demonstrate that SPP1 is essential for maintaining the fate of MPCs and promoting metastasis formation.

We next sought to investigate the molecular mechanism of SPP1 function. We previously identified Grem1 as a BMP2 target gene to control epithelial cell identity3. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of Spp1Δ/Δ KPFV and control organoids revealed that SPP1 function is required for Bmp2 and Grem1 expression (Fig. 4a), a result that was confirmed by RT–qPCR (Fig. 4b). Similarly, Itgb3 knockout significantly attenuated Bmp2 and Grem1 expression (Fig. 4c). Conversely, overexpressing Itgb3 increased Bmp2 and Grem1 expression (Extended Data Fig. 8a). This result suggests that the signalling axis SPP1–CD61–BMP2–GREM1 operates between EPC and MPC PDAC subpopulations.

RNA-seq analysis revealed that Itgb3 knockout organoids showed impaired NF-κB signalling (Extended Data Fig. 8b). RT–qPCR confirmed downregulation of the NF-κB target genes Ccl2 (ref. 19), Clap2 (ref. 20) and Tnf19, whereas their expression increased when Itgb3 was overexpressed (Extended Data Fig. 8c,d). Next, using the JASPAR database21, we identified two putative NF-κB-binding sites in the Bmp2 promoter, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays for RelA confirmed binding to these two sites in the Bmp2 promoter (Extended Data Fig. 8e,f). The TAK1 kinase inhibitor 5Z-7-oxozeaenol22 significantly inhibited the binding of RelA to the site at +1597 and reduced Bmp2 mRNA levels (Extended Data Fig. 8g,h). Thus, SPP1 induces Bmp2 expression, and indirectly the expression of the BMP2 target gene Grem1, by activating the NF-κB signalling pathway.

BMP2 treatment increased Bmp2 expression, which indicated the presence of an autoregulatory feedback loop23,24, and also upregulated Grem1 but decreased Spp1 expression (Fig. 4d). BMP2 treatment led to a rapid induction of the BMP target genes Id1, Id2 and Id3, but Spp1 downregulation occurred only after 24 h and coincided with an increase in Vim expression. By contrast, treatment with the BMP inhibitor LDN193189 led to the opposite effect (Extended Data Fig. 8i–k), which indicated that Spp1 is expressed as a consequence of epithelial identity. Thus, BMP2, SPP1 and GREM1 are components of a complex regulatory loop that determines PDAC cell fate.

To better understand the mechanism of PDAC cell fate determination, we generated Spp1 and Grem1 compound double-knockout models (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). Concomitant inactivation of Grem1 reverted the epithelial phenotype of Spp1 knockout to fully mesenchymal PDAC. Moreover, Grem1 heterozygosity combined with Spp1 knockout resulted in WT PDAC histology (Fig. 4e,f and Extended Data Fig. 9c), a result that highlighted their directly opposing functions. Furthermore, subsequent Grem1 knockout reversed the effect of Spp1 knockout and produced a mesenchymal phenotype. Conversely, Grem1 overexpression reversed the effects of Spp1 overexpression and induced an epithelia phenotype (Extended Data Figs. 10a–h and 11a–h). These results further emphasize the antagonistic relationship between SPP1 and GREM1.

Cellular heterogeneity is a prominent feature used for the classification of pancreatic cancer25,26,27. We showed here that epithelial and mesenchymal PDAC subpopulations are required for the maintenance of each other through a reciprocal, paracrine signalling network of three diffusible molecules: SPP1, BMP2 and GREM1 (Extended Data Fig. 12). We speculate that the mutual dependency of epithelial and mesenchymal subpopulations may underlie the obligatory cellular heterogeneity seen in PDAC. Moreover, our data suggested that cellular heterogeneity is required for efficient pancreatic tumour formation, as decreasing the mesenchymal PDAC subpopulation through Spp1 inactivation led to a substantial extension of lifespan in the aggressive KPF and KPC PDAC models (Fig. 3e,f). Hence therapeutic strategies that aim to reduce cellular heterogeneity could be considered for PDAC treatment.

Peripheral venous blood samples were collected from 26 patients with pancreatic cancer at the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. Plasma was isolated from the collected blood samples, and plasma proteomic analysis was subsequently performed. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and approvals were secured from the ethics board of the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University for the use of these specimens in research. All clinical samples were collected with informed consent, and all experiments adhered to the regulations and approvals of the internal review and ethics board at the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. The Institutional Review Board approval number is KY-2024-249-01. Clinical information on the patients, including age, sex, TNM stage, histology and differentiation, was obtained from medical and follow-up records (Supplementary Table 1).

Human pancreatic tissue samples were obtained from patients at the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University who underwent surgery for pancreatic neoplasia. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and approvals were secured from the ethics board of the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University for the use of these specimens in research. The tissue samples were collected in Advanced DMEM/F12 base medium with 100 µg ml–1 Primocin and minced into 1 mm2 pieces with a scissor. Minced tissue was then washed in the base medium and resuspended in 10 ml digestion medium containing Advanced DMEM/F12, 5 mg ml–1 collagenase XI, 2 mg ml–1 dispase II and 10 µg ml–1 DNase I. Tumour fragments were digested for 2–4 h on a Thermo Scientific tube rotator at 37 °C at speed 25. Digestion was stopped by adding the base medium. Tissue was then washed and centrifuged twice with the base medium and digested for 10 min with TrypLE Express (Gibco) supplemented with Y-27632 (10 µM). Tissue was then filtered through a 100 µm cell filter (Falcon), washed and centrifuged twice in the base medium. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml red cell lysis buffer (Corning) for 5 min. Cells were then washed and centrifuged a further 2 times in the base medium, resuspended in 50 µl Matrigel per well (Corning) and plated onto pre-warmed 24-well plates. Next, 500 µl medium per well was added 15–30 min later once the Matrigel had solidified. The medium contained 1× B27 supplement, 10 mM nicotinamide, 1.25mM N-acetylcysteine, 10 nM gastrin, 100 ng ml–1 human FGF10, 100 ng ml–1 mouse Noggin, 500 nM A83-01, 100 µg ml–1 Primocin, 50 ng ml–1 EGF, 10 µM Y-27632, 10% (v/v) R-Spondin 1 conditioned medium and 50% (v/v) WNT3A conditioned medium.

For protein extraction, cellular debris from the plasma samples was removed through centrifugation at 12,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then carefully transferred to a fresh centrifuge tube, and the protein was quantified using a BCA kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

For trypsin digestion, high-abundant proteins were first removed from the plasma samples using a kit (A36369, Thermo), and the solution was then treated with 5 mM dithiothreitol for 30 min at 56 °C, followed by alkylation with 11 mM iodoacetamide for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Next, 70 μl enzyme digestion buffer was added to the beads and incubated at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by allowing the samples to return to room temperature. Trypsin was then added to a final concentration of 20 ng μl–1 for overnight digestion. The resulting peptides were desalted using C18 ZipTips (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then dried for subsequent mass spectrometry (MS) analysis.

For liquid chromatography–MS/MS analysis, the tryptic peptides were resuspended in solvent A and directly loaded onto a self-fabricated reversed-phase analytical column (15 cm in length, 100 μm internal diameter). The mobile phase was composed of solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and solvent B (0.1% formic acid and 80% acetonitrile in water). Peptides were separated using the following gradient: 0–1.6 min, 4–22.5% B; 1.6–2.0 min, 22.5–35% B; 2.0–2.6 min, 35–55% B; 2.6–2.7 min, 55–99% B; 2.7–6.8 min, 99% B; 6.8–7.6 min, 99% B, all at a constant flow rate of 300 nl min–1 on a Vanquish Neo UPLC system (ThermoFisher Scientific).

The separated peptides were analysed using an Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-electrospray ion source. The electrospray voltage was set to 1,900 V. Precursors were analysed in the Orbitrap detector, whereas fragments were analysed in the Astral detector. The full MS scan resolution was set to 240,000 with a scan range of 380–980 m/z. The MS/MS scan was fixed with a first mass of 150.0 m/z at a resolution of 80,000. Higher-energy collisional dissociation fragmentation was performed at a normalized collision energy of 25%. The automatic gain control target was set at 500%, with a maximum injection time of 3 ms.

For database searches, the data-independent acquisition (DIA) data were processed using the DIA-NN search engine (v.1.8). Tandem mass spectra were searched against the Homo_sapiens_9606_SP_20231220.fasta database (20,429 entries) concatenated with a reversed decoy database. Trypsin/P was specified as the cleavage enzyme, allowing up to one missed cleavage. Excision on the amino-terminal Met and carbamidomethylation on Cys were specified as fixed modifications. The false discovery rate (FDR) was adjusted to be less than 1%.

To address missing values in our dataset, we used the K-nearest neighbours imputation method using the KNNImputer function from the scikit-learn library in Python28.

The KrasLSL-G12D (ref. 29), Trp53flox (ref. 30), Trp53R172H (ref. 31), Pdx1-cre (ref. 32), Pdx1-Flp, KRasFSF-G12D, Trp53frt, Rosa26FSF-creER (ref. 14), Rosa26LSL-YFP (ref. 33), Rosa26mT/mG (ref. 15) and Grem1fl (ref. 34) mouse lines have been previously described. The VIM–GFP transgenic line developed by the Gene Expression Nervous System Atlas (GENSAT) Project was obtained from the Mutant Mouse Resource & Research Centers9. Spp1fl mice (NM-CKO-210205) were purchased from the Shanghai Model Organisms Center. These lines were intercrossed to generate the desired genotypes of both sexes on a C57BL/6 background in Charles River Laboratories. Mouse genotypes were determined using real-time PCR with specific probes designed for each gene (Transnetyx).

To activate CreERT recombinase after tumour onset, Pdx1-Flp;KrasFSF-G12D;Trp53frt/frt;Rosa26FSF-creER;Rosa26mT/mG;Spp1fl/fl (Spp1fl/fl KPFCT), Spp1WT/WT KPFCT, Grem1fl/fl KPFCT, Grem1fl/WT KPFCT, Spp1fl/flGrem1fl/WT KPFCT and Spp1fl/fGrem1fl/fl KPFCT mice were given tamoxifen through intraperitoneal injections at a dose of 100 mg kg−1 body weight, once a day for 5 days at 25 days of age. Pdx1-Flp;KrasFSF-G12D;Trp53WT/frt;Rosa26FSF-creER;Rosa26mT/mG;Spp1fl/fl (Spp1fl/fl KPhetFCT) and Spp1WT/WT KPhetFCT mice were given tamoxifen at the same doses at 100 days of age. Sample sizes were determined on the basis of the results of our preliminary experiments. Mice from autochthonous tumour models were selected according to their correct genotypes.

Plasma was isolated from the collected blood samples from mice after humane euthanasia. The samples were centrifugated at 12,000g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was carefully transferred to a fresh centrifuge tube. Protein levels were quantified using a BCA kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. ELISA was performed according to the Mouse & Rat Osteopontin (OPN) ELISA Kit–Quantikine protocol (R&D System). The plasma SPP1 concentration was calculated on the basis of the Mouse/Rat OPN standard.

The immunocompromised Nu/Nu mice used have been previously described35, and adults (aged 8–12 weeks) obtained from Charles River Laboratories were used for transplantation.

Cells dissociated from organoids were subcutaneously injected in 50 μl cold growth-factor-reduced Matrigel (Corning). For Spp1 knockout organoid transplantation, a total 10,000 Spp1Δ/Δ KPF and Spp1WT/WT cells were injected into contralateral flanks of Nu/Nu mice. For Itgb3 knockout organoid transplantation, a total 100,000 Itgb3Δ/Δ KPF and Itgb3WT/WT cells were injected into contralateral flanks of Nu/Nu mice. For the inducible Grem1 deletion after Spp1 deletion analysis, we used CRISPR–Cas9-mediated knockout of Spp1 in GFP-labelled Grem1fl/fl KPFC organoids, and a total 100,000 cells dissociated from GFP-labelled Grem1fl/flSpp1Δ/Δ KPFC organoids were injected into the flanks of Nu/Nu mice. After tumours reached a size of 100 mm3, tamoxifen or peanut oil (vehicle) was intraperitoneally injected at a dose of 100 mg kg−1 body weight once a day for 5 days. For the inducible Grem1 overexpression after Spp1 overexpression analysis, we used Plv-SPP1–GFP and pINDUCER-GREM1 overexpression lentiviral vectors in KPFC organoids, and a total of 100,000 cells dissociated from Plv-SPP1–GFP and pINDUCER-GREM1 KPF organoids were injected into the flanks of Nu/Nu mice. After tumours reached a size of 100 mm3, doxycycline or saline (vehicle) was intraperitoneally injected at a dose of 2 mg kg–1 body weight twice weekly.

Tumour growth was monitored twice a week and mice were humanely euthanized when the tumour size reached a mean diameter of 1.2 cm. The tumours were weighed and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Cellstor) for histological analyses.

All animal experiments were approved by the Institute of Cancer Research, London's Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body and conformed to UK Home Office regulations under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, including Amendment Regulations 2012. The mice were housed in individually ventilated cages at constant temperature and humidity (23 ± 2 °C, 50–60%) in a pathogen-free controlled environment, with a standard 12 h light–12 h dark cycle and unlimited access water and food. For subcutaneous transplantation experiments, the maximum tumour size did not exceed the mean diameter of 1.2 cm, in compliance with project licence PP9490916.

The injection technique was adapted from published literature36,37. Under anaesthesia, mice were placed in a supine position on a heated (37 °C) ultrasound platform. The platform was rotated 180° anticlockwise to position the injection mount towards the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. Ultrasound gel was applied to the upper part of the abdomen and the pancreas was located by using the left kidney and spleen as a reference. Once a clear image of the pancreas was located, a syringe was mounted into the holder and the needle was brought towards the field of view using the x axis micromanipulator. With an appropriate angle, the needle was pierced through the skin and pushed forward until the tip was in the pancreas. KPR172H/+C Spp1 overexpression (n = 10,000) cells and KPR172H/+C control (n = 10,000 cells) cells, suspended in 25 μl of 90% cold growth-factor-reduced Matrigel (Corning), were slowly injected into the pancreas using a 1 ml syringe with a 29 gauge needle. Successful injection was confirmed by the presence of hyperechogenic contrast from the Matrigel inside the pancreas. The needle was slowly withdrawn after 15 s of delay to prevent leakage.

The precise acquisition of ultrasound images of pancreatic tumours was performed using a Microscan transducer MS-550D (VEVO 2100; Visualsonics). Mice were gently anaesthetized with 1.5–2.5% isoflurane in oxygen at a flow rate of 1 l min−1 and placed in a supine position on a preheated (37 °C) ultrasound platform. Pancreatic tumours were located and labelled using the 2D B-mode setting. For tumour volume measurement, consecutive 2D-mode images were acquired by scanning across the entire tumour at intervals of 0.2 mm using the 3D stage control system, and then reconstructed into a 3D volume. The heart rate, respiration rate and body temperature were monitored throughout the scanning process to ensure stable vital signs of the mice. The 3D tumour volume was calculated using the 3D analysis tool Vevo Lab (v.3.2.0).

Organoids were grown to 80–90% confluence before injection. Organoids were dissociated using TrypLE Express supplemented with Y-27632 (10 µM) into single cells and small clusters, and then counted using an automated cell counter. Cells were then resuspended to the indicated concentration in a 50% Matrigel and 50% organoid culturing medium. Next, 50 µl of the cell mixture was injected into the flank of male NSG mice aged 6 weeks. The tumour size was monitored twice weekly with callipers, and tumours were allowed to grow for about 2 months. Tumour volumes were calculated using the formula volume = length × width2/2, as previously described3. Mice were killed at either the study end point or when the tumour reached the maximum allowable volume (tumour volume = 1.5 cm2), and tissues were collected for downstream analyses. The animal use protocol listed was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), Sun Yat-Sen University (approval no. SYSU-IACUC-2025-B0073).

KPR172H/+CY mice (100 days old) were intraperitoneally injected 3 times a week for 3 months with mouse SPP1 antibody (BioxCell, clone MPIIIB10; 200 μg per mouse per injection) or control antibody (mouse IgG isotype control, Cell Sciences; 200 μg per mouse per injection) in independent experiments.

After humane euthanasia, mice were disinfected with 70% ethanol and pancreatic tumours were dissected and placed into ice-cold DMEM–F-12 containing 50 U ml–1 penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The tissue samples were minced on ice using sterile tissue scissors and then incubated in DMEM containing 1 mg ml–1 collagenase V (Sigma-Aldrich) in a shaking incubator for 1 h. After digestion, the process was halted by adding ice-cold G solution, and the cells were centrifuged at 300g for 5 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, the cells underwent further digestion with TrypLE (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by stopping the reaction with ice-cold 2% FCS in PBS and centrifugation. The cells were resuspended, filtered through a 40 μm nylon mesh, centrifuged again and then plated in Matrigel. Organoid medium was used as previously described38. To ensure the selection of cancer cells in the culture, for the first five passages, they were cultured in medium without EGF. After the fifth passage, complete organoid medium was used for culturing and experimentation.

Organoids were grown in chamber slides (Ibidi) and washed twice with ice-cold PBS, fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min and blocked in PBS containing 10% FCS (Gibco), 1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). Primary antibodies were incubated in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight. Fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies together with 3 μM DAPI were incubated in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Stained organoids were imaged on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope and analysed with Imaris (v.9.5.1).

After standard dissection of mice, tumour tissue samples were collected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 h. The tumours were then transferred to 70% ethanol for storage, followed by gradual dehydration in ethanol and embedding in paraffin. The paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned into 4-μm-thick slices. H&E staining and DAB immunohistochemistry were conducted by the Histopathology Core Facility Breast Cancer Research at The Institute of Cancer Research using standard procedures. All staining was carried out using a Dako Autostainer Link48 (Agilent Technologies) immunostaining platform with epitope retrieval and simultaneous dewaxing using the Dako PT Link module (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections were cut at 4 µm onto APEX adhesive slides (Leica Biosystems), dried at 60 °C for 60 min and subject to epitope retrieval at 97 °C for 20 min using either Dako Target Retrieval Solution pH 9 (Agilent Technologies, K800421-2) or pH 6 (Agilent Technologies, K800521-2) as described below. Primary antibodies were diluted in Dako FLEX antibody diluent (Agilent, K800621-2) and endogenous peroxidases were blocked using Dako REAL peroxidase block (Agilent, S202386-2). Antibody binding reactions were visualized using Dako DAB+ (Agilent, K346811-2) and sections were counterstained using Dako FLEX Haematoxylin (Agilent, K800821-2). The following antibodies were used for the indicated experiments: CK19 DSHB rat monoclonal TROMA III (primary dilution 1:200), epitope retrieval = pH 9, detection system = anti-rat N-histofine polymer-HRP (Nichirei Biosciences, 414311F); vimentin, Cell Signaling Technology rabbit monoclonal D21H3, 5741 (primary dilution 1:200), epitope retrieval = pH 9, detection system = Dako rabbit EnVision polymer-HRP (Agilent, K400311-2). Stained slides were imaged on a NanoZoomer (Hamamatsu Photonics) slide scanner and analysed with QuPath (v.0.4.2)39. Analyses and grading of PDACs were performed by a certified pathologist based on H&E staining. For liver and lung metastases, H&E-stained sections of paraffin-embedded tissues were analysed, and the number of metastases per section was quantified using ImageJ.

Paraffin sections from tumour tissues were prepared as described above, and antigen retrieval was performed by heating in 10 mM sodium citrate (Sigma-Aldrich) buffer (adjust pH 6.0 by using hydrochloric acid). The sections were blocked using blocking buffer (PBS containing 10% FCS and 1% BSA from Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 1 h, followed by overnight incubation with primary antibodies prepared in blocking buffer at 4 °C in a cold room. On the next day, fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200) along with 3 μM DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) in blocking buffer were applied in the dark at room temperature for 1 h. A list of the antibodies used is provided in Supplementary Table 2. Before mounting, slides were incubated in 0.1% (w/v) Sudan Black B (Sigma-Aldrich) in fresh 70% ethanol to reduce background signal. Stained slides were imaged on a Leica confocal microscope or a NanoZoomer (Hamamatsu Photonics) slide scanner and analysed using Imaris.

The target gene was deleted in organoids using the CRISPR–Cas9 system. The protocol for engineering organoids was adapted and modified from a previous study40. Organoids were dissociated into single cells using TrypLE and diluted to 1 × 106 cells per electroporation. The cell pellet was then resuspended in a precise 100 μl solution containing BTXpress solution (BTX), 7.2 μg PB-CMV-MCS-EF1a-RFP-T2A-Puro (System Biosciences) or pPB[Exp]-CMV>Hygro (Vectorbuilder), 2.8 μg CMV-pHyPBase or pRP[Exp]-mCherry-CAG>hyPBase (Vectorbuilder), and 10 μg PX330 (provided by F. Zhang, Addgene, 4223062) with a target gRNA. The cell–DNA mixture was transferred to 2 mm electroporation cuvettes (Nepagene) and electroporated using a NEPA21 super electroporator (Nepagene), with settings described in our previous publication41. After electroporation, the cell suspension was transferred to complete medium containing Y-27632 (10 μM) without antibiotics. After 30 min, cells were centrifuged at 300g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in Matrigel and cultured in antibiotic-free complete medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632. On day 5 after electroporation, organoids were selected with 2 μg ml–1 puromycin or 100 mg ml–1 hygromycin B. After 3 days of selection, organoids were flow sorted into single cells into a 96-well plate with 30 μl Matrigel per well. gDNA was extracted using a Purelink Genomic DNA Minikit per the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). PCR was performed using Q5 High-Fidelity 2× master mix (New England Biolabs) with pre-designed primers and gDNA. Subsequently, PCR products were amplified and cloned using a Zero Blunt PCR Cloning kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and sequenced by Sanger sequencing from Genewiz. A list of the gRNAs used is provided in Supplementary Table 3.

Organoids or tissues were dissociated into single cells as mentioned above. Single cells were suspended in FACS buffer (PBS containing 2% FCS). The cells were incubated with fluorophore-conjugated isotype control or experimental antibodies in FACS buffer on ice in the dark for 30 min. A list of the antibodies used is provided in Supplementary Table 2. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS, filtered through a 40 μm nylon mesh (Corning) and then incubated in FACS buffer containing 3 μM DAPI or propidium iodide. Single-colour and fluorescence minus one staining control were used as necessary. The cells were analysed using FACSymphony A5 (BD Biosciences) analyzer. Data were analysed using FlowJo 10 software. The gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2.

RNA was extracted from organoids using either a RNAqueous-Micro Total RNA Isolation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or a RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. For BMP2 and LDN193189 treatment, organoids were starved in DMEM with 1% FCS overnight and treated with vehicle, 100 ng ml–1 recombinant BMP2 Protein (R&D Systems) or 100 nM LDN193189 (Tocris) for 12 h, followed by RNA extraction from the cells. cDNA was generated using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was diluted 1:10 in distilled water, and 2 μl was used per qPCR reaction. PowerUp SYBR Green master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for qPCR on an ABI7500 or QuantStudio 6 Flex (Applied Biosystems) system. Primers were designed using the Primer-BLAST tool at NCBI and made by Sigma-Aldrich. Housekeeping gene mRNA levels (Actb or Rplp0) were used for normalization. mRNA levels were quantified using the difference in Ct values and calculated using the \({2}^{-\Delta \Delta {C}_{{\rm{t}}}}\) method42. A list of the qPCR primers used is provided in Supplementary Table 4.

Matrigel was removed from cells on ice using Cell Recovery solution (Corning) following the manufacturer's instructions. The Matrigel-depleted cells were lysed in ice-cold cell lysis buffer (NEB) as previously described3. After brief sonication, lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 r.p.m. for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein quantification was performed using a Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad), and proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE on 10% gels (Bio-Rad), then transferred onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) using a Trans-Blot Turbo system (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were blocked in TBST containing 3% BSA at room temperature for 1 h, then incubated with primary antibodies prepared in TBST with 1% BSA overnight at 4 °C. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were subsequently incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Chemiluminescence was detected using Amersham ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection reagent (GE Healthcare) in an Amersham ImageQuant 800 imaging system. A list of the antibodies used is provided in Supplementary Table 2.

The Itgb3 overexpression, Spp1 overexpression, SPP1 overexpression, control and GFP vectors were purchased from Vectorbuilder. GFP and inducible Grem1 were cloned into pLenti6 V5-DEST (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or pInducer20-Blast (Addgene, 109334) using the BP and LR Recombination System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Lentiviral particles were produced in HEK293T cells using psPAX2 and pMD2.G helper plasmids (Addgene) and transfected into HEK293T cells using jetPRIME transfection reagent (jetPRIME). For organoid infection, a single-cell suspension was prepared and incubated with lentiviruses supplemented with 4 μg ml–1 polybrene (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in a rocking incubator for 6 h. Cells were then seeded in Matrigel and antibiotic selection was applied 3 days later.

To predict transcription factor binding motifs in the Bmp2 promoter, DNA sequences ranging from −1000 to +500 bp from the transcription start site were scanned in the JASPAR 2000 database (http://jaspar.genereg.net/) using a relative profile score threshold of 80%. The JASPAR relative score is defined as 1 for the maximum-likelihood binding site21.

Organoids were dissociated and plated on 2D culture dishes and cultured in DMEM with 5% FCS. After exponential growth, the cells were switched to DMEM containing 1% FCS and starved overnight, followed by treatment with vehicle or 5Z-7-oxozeaenol for 6 h. The cells were fixed and crosslinked chromatin was prepared as previously described3. For immunoprecipitation, 10 μg chromatin was incubated with 10 μl anti-histone H3 rabbit IgG (CST, used as a positive control), 2 μl normal rabbit IgG (CST) or 5 μl of anti-RelA antibody (CST) overnight at 4 °C. Before immunoprecipitation, 2% of the chromatin (v/v) was used as input. Protein G magnetic beads were used to capture chromatin–protein–antibody complexes, followed by reversal of crosslinking to release chromatin and purification using a SimpleChIP Enzymatic Chromatin IP kit (CST). DNA was quantified by qPCR using primers targeting predicted Rela-binding regions at the Bmp2 promoter. The DNA level was normalized to the input, and the fold enrichment was calculated by normalizing to the control. A list of the chromatin immunoprecipitation qPCR primers is provided in Supplementary Table 5. A list of the antibodies used is provided in Supplementary Table 2.

For the RNA-seq analysis of Spp1 and Itgb3 WT and knockout organoids, RNA was extracted from organoids using a RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. mRNA capture and library preparation were performed by Genewiz. Biological replicate libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq platform at Genewiz, which generated an average of approximately 25 million 150 bp paired-end reads per sample. Sequence reads were processed using Trimmomatic (v.0.36) to remove possible adapter sequences and nucleotides with poor quality43. Reads were aligned to the mouse reference assembly to the Mus musculus GRCm38 reference genome available on ENSEMBL using STAR aligner (v.2.5.2b)44. Normalization of raw counts and regularized log-transformation were performed as previously described3.

For the RNA-seq dataset of Spp1 and Itgb3 WT and knockout organoids, GSEA (v.4.0.3) analysis was performed using the rlog-transformed counts, with the following settings applied: number of permutations = 1000, permutation type = gene set, enrichment statistics = weighted, metric for ranking genes = Signal2Noise. Normalized expression values of PDAC samples from the datasets GSE71729, ICGCarray, ICGCseq, TCGA, GSE62452 and GSE79668 were batch corrected using ComBat algorithm. Samples were grouped into SPP1high and SPP1low based on the median expression level. For GSEA, the following settings were applied: including the number of permutations = 1000, permutation type = phenotype, enrichment statistics = weighted, metric for ranking genes = Signal2Noise. The EMT gene set of 200 genes was checked for significant enrichment with an FDR q < 0.2.

For human PDAC scRNA-seq data, fastq files of 24 PDAC and 11 normal pancreas samples were downloaded from the Chinese National Genomics Data Center (Genome Sequence Archive: CRA001160) and processed as previously described45. Uniform manifold approximation and projection plots were generated using the R package Seurat (v.3.2.2) with default settings. Cells were coloured according to cluster assignments from the reference. For evaluating SPP1 expression and its association with EMT in ductal cells (type 1 and 2), raw counts were normalized to counts per million (CPM) using the edgeR package in R (v.4.0.3) and log2[CPM + 1] transformed. Cells belonging to ductal clusters 1 and 2 were categorized into SPP1high and SPP1low based on expression levels.

Diagrams in Fig. 1a and Extended Data Figs. 7a, 10a, 11a and 12 were created in BioRender (https://biorender.com).

All images and graphs represent the results of multiple experiments, which were conducted on different biological replicate samples and different dates. Each experiment was independently repeated. Differential gene expression analysis for RNA-seq data was performed using the edgeR package in R. All other statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 8 for Windows. Specific statistical tests are specified in the figure legends. All t-tests tests, Fisher-exact tests and Mann–Whitney tests were two-sided.

The survival plots for Spp1fl/fl KPFCT and Spp1WT/WT KPFCT mice receiving tamoxifen treatment and for Spp1fl/fl KPCY, Spp1WT/WT KPCY mice and SPP1 neutralization experiments were created and analysed using two-sided log-rank tests in GraphPad Prism 8. The following PDAC datasets were used: GSE71729, ICGCarray, ICGCseq, TCGA, GSE62452 and GSE79668. The normalized ComBat batch-corrected expression values were used for categorizing samples to SPP1high and SPP1low based on surv_cutpoint function in survminer R package. This function determines the optimal cut-off by maximally selected rank statistics.

Metrics details

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are highly effective in haematological malignancies1. However, progressive loss of CAR T cells contributes to relapse in many patients2,3,4. Here we performed in vivo loss-of-function CRISPR screens in CAR T cells targeting B cell maturation antigen to investigate genes that influence CAR T cell persistence and function in a human multiple myeloma model. We tracked the expansion and persistence of CRISPR library-edited T cells in vitro and at early and late time points in vivo to track the performance of gene-modified CAR T cells from manufacturing to survival in tumours. The screens revealed context-specific regulators of CAR T cell expansion and persistence. Ablation of RASA2 and SOCS1 enhanced T cell expansion in vitro, whereas loss of PTPN2, ZC3H12A and RC3H1 conferred early growth advantages to CAR T cells in vivo. Notably, we identified cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (encoded by CDKN1B), a cell cycle regulator, as the most important factor limiting CAR T cell fitness at late time points in vivo. CDKN1B ablation increased CAR T cell proliferation and effector function, significantly enhancing tumour clearance and overall survival. Our findings reveal differing effects of gene perturbation on CAR T cells over time and in different environments, highlight CDKN1B as a promising target to generate highly effective CAR T cells for multiple myeloma and underscore the potential of in vivo screening for identifying genes to enhance CAR T cell efficacy.

Despite decades of investigation, it remains unclear (and hard to predict1,2,3,4) how the outcomes of chemical reactions change over multidimensional ‘hyperspaces' defined by reaction conditions5. Whereas human chemists can explore only a limited subset of these manifolds, automated platforms6,7,8,9,10,11,12 can generate thousands of reactions in parallel. Yet, purification and yield quantification remain bottlenecks, constrained by time-consuming and resource-intensive analytical techniques. As a result, our understanding of reaction hyperspaces remains fragmentary7,9,13,14,15,16. Are yield distributions smooth or corrugated? Do they conceal mechanistically new reactions? Can major products vary across different regions? Here, to address these questions, we developed a low-cost robotic platform using primarily optical detection to quantify yields of products and by-products at unprecedented throughput and minimal cost per condition. Scanning hyperspaces across thousands of conditions, we find and prove mathematically that, for continuous variables (concentrations, temperatures), individual yield distributions are generally slow-varying. At the same time, we uncover hyperspace regions of unexpected reactivity as well as switchovers between major products. Moreover, by systematically surveying substrate proportions, we reconstruct underlying reaction networks and expose hidden intermediates and products—even in reactions studied for well over a century. This hyperspace-scanning approach provides a versatile and scalable framework for reaction optimization and discovery. Crucially, it can help identify conditions under which complex mixtures can be driven cleanly towards different major products, thereby expanding synthetic diversity while reducing chemical input requirements.

Owing to rapid advances in chemical automation, there has been a growing number of high-throughput campaigns to discover new modes of reactivity6,7,12,16,17, maximize reaction yields (often under the guidance of various optimization algorithms9,15,18) and produce standardized data sought urgently19 by chemical artificial intelligence. Our goals here were different, as we wished to reconstruct complete portraits of chemical reactions over multidimensional parameter spaces (concentrations, temperatures), with the quantification of yields not only for the major products but also for as many by-products as could be identified. Anticipating thousands of crude mixtures to analyse (here >9,000 in total), we wished to minimize the use of techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS), which, at their maximum throughput of only a few samples per hour, become costly and require prolonged or even dedicated access to equipment, which may be prohibitive for most academic groups. Accordingly, we relied heavily on inexpensive (cents per sample) and rapid (about 100 samples per hour) ultraviolet–visible (UV-Vis) detection augmented with algorithms to decompose complex spectra (that is, not just those featuring distinct and easy-to-interpret spectral features20,21) and with autocorrelation metrics to quantify missing information and detect anomalous outcomes.

Unless otherwise stated, experiments were performed on a robotic platform (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Video 1) house-built to support various organic solvents and harsh reagents and allowing us to execute and characterize up to roughly 1,000 reactions per day (for design blueprints and computer codes, see Methods and Supplementary Information Sections 1 and 2).

a, Parts of the house-built, inexpensive (about $25K) system: (1) horizontal gantry; (2) liquid-handling module; (3) racks of pipette tips; (4) stock solutions; (5) 54-vial plates; (6) UV-Vis spectrophotometer; (7) balance for weighing of solutions (see Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). b, Hypothetical A + B → C reaction space defined by initial concentrations [A]0 and [B]0 and temperature T. c, UV-Vis spectra of the HPLC-isolated species are measured at different concentrations (here for Claisen–Schmidt condensation from Fig. 2a). d, At each point of the conditions' space, the UV-Vis spectrum (grey) is decomposed—here nearly perfectly—into the component spectra from c, quantifying the concentrations/yields of these components in the crude mixture. e, Stoichiometry of reaction places constraints on possible concentrations (blue) of components in the crude mixture (see Methods). f, Example of a perfect linear dependence (‘multicollinearity'), in which the brown spectrum in the top subplot happens to be a linear sum of the cyan and purple ones (scaled by, respectively, 0.50 and 0.25). Consequently, unmixing is an ill-conditioned problem, as the spectrum of the entire mixture (black) can be decomposed into infinitely many combinations of the brown, cyan and purple components (1:1:1 in the top and 0.5:0.75:2 in the bottom subplots). g, Correlation matrix for components A, B and C of the Claisen–Schmidt condensation from d. Low off-diagonal elements indicate no strong multicollinearity. h, Statistical distributions of yields with respect to the limiting reagent. Relative standard deviations are 2% between repeated optical detection performed on the same crude mixture (n = 54) and 5% between experimental repeats (n = 27) of the entire workflow for the same conditions (data from Fig. 5). i, Differences between experimental and modelled spectra (from d) as a function of wavelength. The fit is adequate, as this trace closely resembles uncorrelated (‘white') noise.

For a given reaction under study, this robot examines the hyperspace of conditions at points of some N-dimensional grid (for example, uniform in Fig. 1b), setting up reactions and acquiring UV-Vis absorption spectra at each point and at desired time(s). The acquisition of an individual spectrum takes, on average, roughly 8 s, whereas the accompanying pipetting and spectrometer washing–drying take about 50 s in total (Supplementary Video 2). In a subsequent (and perhaps counterintuitive) step, the crudes from all hyperspace points are combined (Fig. 1b, left). The resultant mixture is separated by chromatography and the isolated fractions are identified by traditional spectroscopic (NMR, MS) analyses. This ‘bulk' analysis is to identify the ‘basis set' of reaction products that form in any appreciable quantities anywhere in the hyperspace. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of these purified products (as well as all substrates, solvents and reagents used) at different concentrations are taken to construct concentration–absorbance calibration curves (Fig. 1c). Then the crude and often complex UV-Vis spectra acquired at each point of the hyperspace (Fig. 1b, right) are fitted by linear combinations of the reference spectra of the basis-set components (Fig. 1d) using the so-called vector decomposition techniques (also known as spectral unmixing22). Overall, this protocol requires conventional high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/NMR/MS analysis of only one complex mixture combining all hyperspace samples (Fig. 1c). It returns on this time investment manifolds by rapidly estimating the yields and mixture compositions at thousands of individual data points within the hyperspace of the reaction.

This general scheme merits two comments. First, it is important to reject potential unmixing solutions violating reaction stoichiometry (Fig. 1e) and to ensure stability of the fit. The latter benefits from the absorption spectra of components being of similar magnitudes and not linearly dependent (Fig. 1f), which is diagnosed by looking at off-diagonal elements of the correlation matrix between the concentrations of the components (Fig. 1g). Satisfying these conditions (1) is increasingly challenging as the number of components increases but (2) is helped by extending the spectral range as much as possible into the UV, at which the absorption bands of organic species are usually more numerous and narrower (see the example in Fig. 5b). With these precautions, yield estimates are within 5% (for example, a 20% yield would have a spread of 19–21%), with optical measurement and spectral unmixing contributing 2% and the remaining 3% caused by uncertainty of pipetting, fluctuations of temperature and residual evaporation (Fig. 1h and Supplementary Information Sections 2.10 and 2.11).

Second, the fitting procedure is accompanied by an algorithm to detect anomalous outcomes in some regions of the hyperspace. This is done by tracking differences between experimental and fitted spectra, calculating the variance of residuals (Fig. 1i) and evaluating the autocorrelation (across wavelengths, not time) of these residuals by the Durbin–Watson statistic. The mismatch is considered notable if the root mean square residual exceeds 0.01 absorbance units or if the Durbin–Watson statistic at 30 nm ‘lag' deviates from the value of 2 (which corresponds to the absence of autocorrelation) more strongly than the respective statistic for the baseline of a given spectrophotometer. If systematic deviation is detected, it then signifies formation of a product unexpected based on the initial scan of the hyperspace (see Fig. 3d,e). Further mathematical details of spectral unmixing and anomaly detection are discussed in Supplementary Information Section 3.

We confirmed that this method is applicable to a range of reactions used widely in both academic groups and industry, including various couplings, condensations, cycloadditions and rearrangements (reactions 1–8 on the green background in Extended Data Fig. 1a), as well as substitutions, eliminations and multicomponent reactions (MCRs), discussed in detail in Figs. 2–6. Expectedly, the approach is not suitable for, for example, reactions of aliphatic scaffolds whose products give no signal in the UV-Vis range above 220 nm and some reactions are borderline in terms of fit quality, owing to the obstruction of the product signal by reactant/solvent peaks (for example, 9–12 in the yellow and red portions of Extended Data Fig. 1a). Notably, yields quantified by the robotized approach correlate strongly, R2 = 0.96, with the yields of the same reactions performed, purified and analysed ex roboto (Extended Data Fig. 1b).

a,b, Schemes of E1 (a) and SN1 (b) reactions and their mechanisms. For the former, we use 9-butyl-9H-fluoren-9-ol substrate 13a and for the latter, to prevent elimination, 9-phenyl-9H-fluoren-9-ol 14a. For E1, the parameters of the mechanism are the temperature dependences of equilibrium constant Kα for dynamic equilibrium between 13a and its protonated form, of equilibrium constant Kβ for dynamic equilibrium between 13b and its protonated form, of pKa of HBr in acetonitrile and the Eyring–Polanyi equation parameters for kinetic rate constants kE1 and k−E1 for water molecule elimination from the protonated 13a (Supplementary Information Section 5.2). For SN1 at a given temperature, the only parameter is the effective equilibrium constant KSN1 = [14b][H2O]/([14a][HBr]) (Supplementary Information Section 5.1). E1 used acetonitrile as solvent. For SN1, the solvent was dioxane with admixture of AcOH (to homogenize the biphasic dioxane–water mixture formed in situ and complicating optical detection). c,d, Corresponding yield distributions of products 13b and 14b. For clarity, only 125 conditions per cube are shown. Marker colours and sizes are proportional to yields. Yield colour scales are the same for both cubes. Surfaces of equal yield are at 20%, 40%, 70% and 85%. e,f, Kinetics model (curves) fitted to experimental yields with respect to alcohol (circles) for E1 and SN1 reactions. To better visualize the quality of fits, only two-dimensional snapshots of the entire dataset are shown, here T = 21 °C for E1 and T = 36 °C for SN1 (for similar plots at all temperatures, see Supplementary Information Sections 5.1 and 5.2). Horizontal axis has the initial concentrations of HBr, with the colour corresponding to different initial concentrations of the alcohol indicated in the keys.

a, Scheme of a reaction between alcohol 15a and HBr leading to major product 15b through anthranyl carbocation 15c. The minor anthraquinone product 15d originates from the cycloaddition of substrate 15a with singlet oxygen to give the endoperoxide, followed by subsequent fragmentations (for details, see Supplementary Fig. 32). The ‘unexpected' carbocation dimer structure is assigned to 15e (for details of structural assignment, see Supplementary Information Sections 4.13 and 6.2). b, Space of reaction yields of the main product 15b under different conditions (reaction time: 24 h; for clarity, only 125 out of 1,085 points are shown; for all data, see Supplementary Information Section 4.15). Fitting the kinetic model to these experimental data reveals that yields of product 15b scale as \(1-\exp \left(-t{k}_{1}[{\rm{HBr}}]\exp \left(-\frac{{E}_{{\rm{a}}}}{{k}_{{\rm{B}}}T}\right)\right)\), in which t is reaction time, \({k}_{1}\exp \left(-\frac{{E}_{{\rm{a}}}}{{k}_{{\rm{B}}}T}\right)\) is the kinetic rate constant at a given temperature (prefactor k1 is a free parameter), Ea is the activation energy free parameter and [HBr] is the concentration of HBr—that is, these conversions increase with [HBr] and with temperature, do not depend on the initial concentration of the alcohol substrate and the rate-limiting step is formation of a carbocation 15c, all as expected for SN1 reaction. The isosurfaces correspond to 20%, 40%, 70% and 85% yield. c, Distribution of yields for the side product 15d. The isosurface corresponds to 20% yield. d, Pink cloud delineates a narrow region of conditions in which an anomalous outcome—that is, carbocation dimer 15e—is observed. e, Pink line is a typical UV-Vis spectrum from the region of conditions in which an anomalous outcome is observed. The dashed line is a typical experimental spectrum for which this anomaly is absent. Blue line is the ab initio theoretical absorption spectrum of 1.23 nM of 15e after summation with the dashed ‘baseline', blue band is the 1σ confidence interval (see Supplementary Information Section 6.2).

a–d, Snapshots of the reaction's four-dimensional hyperspace. The axes of each plot are initial amine, aldehyde and isocyanide concentrations for initial concentrations of pTSA indicated above each plot. Experimental yields (after 16 h at 26 °C) of product 16e are colour-coded according to the legend in d. Only 125 interpolated conditions per cube are shown for clarity (see Supplementary Information Section 4.15 and Supplementary Video 3). Green and blue stars mark two distinct yield maxima. e–h, Corresponding yield distributions of 16e predicted by a kinetic model fitted simultaneously to all experimental data (yield isosurfaces are at 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5% and 5.0%). This model is based on a kinetic network outlined in i and further side reactions (see Supplementary Information Scheme 5). The original reaction of 16a, 16b, 16c and DMF using initiator 16d and leading to product 16e is on the yellow background. The classic Ugi mechanism is summarized by blue arrows (for details, see Supplementary Information Scheme 6). A competing oxazoline-based path (brown) was experimentally excluded (red cross). A third mechanism (magenta), potentially active at high [pTSA]0 and involving aldehyde, amine and isocyanide in a 1:1:2 ratio, did not improve model fit. The theoretical model (Supplementary Tables 19, 20, 22 and 23) comprised this entire mechanistic network of 12 reactions and 15 proton transfer steps. Best-fitted model followed the data closely while retaining pKa values (in red font) of most species within 1–2 units from literature values (black font) used as initial guess (see Supplementary Information Section 5.3). j, Experimental and modelled yield profiles at the two maxima (corners A and B in a) along [pTSA]0 confirm that yields at global/local maxima are higher than at any four-dimensional paths connecting them (see Supplementary Video 3 and Supplementary Fig. 161). Error bars correspond to 14.6% relative standard error. k, Initial concentrations at global and local maxima.

a, Identification of reaction products by closed-loop repurification and refitting against four-dimensional hypercube UV-Vis spectra (see Supplementary Information Section 4.15). Within eight repurification rounds, 16 components (14 products plus unreacted 19a and 19c) were identified. The mismatch between fitted and experimental spectra (vertical axis) decreased to the median value of instrumental uncertainty (dashed green line; see Supplementary Information Section 4.9). The vertical axis shows the highest spectral mismatch per condition. Box plot elements indicate the first quartile, median and third quartile, whiskers show the 5th and 95th percentiles, with outliers as black diamonds. Blue scatter plot shows individual data points. b, UV-Vis ‘basis set' of the 16 components. Their discovery follows the cycles in a: 3 components (19a, 19c, 19d), 7 components (+19k, 19r, 19o, 19m), 8 components (+EAB), 11 components (+19j, 19f, 19g), 12 components (+19e), 14 components (+19h, 19p), 15 components (+19i), 16 components (+19h). c, Reaction network: green, substrates; blue, isolated known products/intermediates; red, new products/intermediates. Network connectivity was verified by separate reactions (green arrows): (1) NH4OAc, AcOH, 80 °C, 18 h; (2) ethyl acetoacetate, EtOH, 80 °C, 18 h; (3) EAB, EtOH, 80 °C, 24 h. Note the presence of products of two separate ‘named reactions', Hantzsch (19d) and Petrenko-Kritschenko (19e) (mechanisms are shown in Supplementary Information Schemes 2 and 3. d–f, Within the hyperspace, the reaction network at 80 °C can be switched between three main products observed in different corners of the space: Hantzsch ester 19d (maximum yield 63.5%, <3% 19p) (d); Petrenko-Kritschenko product 19e (maximum yield about 66%) (e); benzylidene-extended Hantzsch derivative 19k (maximum yield 61.7%) (f). These yields (after 48 h) were quantified by HPLC and are colour-coded according to the legend. Isosurfaces correspond to 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% and 60% yield. For full experimental details, see Supplementary Information Sections 4.7, 4.9 and 4.10.

a, 756 PBAs, catalysts with a general formula KMB[MA(CN)6], were prepared by the robot in separate vials using the co-precipitation method. Up to two aqueous solutions of MA and up to five of MB were pipetted automatically with specified volumes to prepare the PBA catalyst suspensions, each with a final volume of 200 µl in individual vials, followed by 24 h of ageing at room temperature. b, Irrespective of the composition, these nanomaterials were particles approximately 50 nm in size. Uniformity of metal distributions was confirmed by energy-dispersive spectroscopy. For large-area scanning electron microscopy images and all experimental details, see Supplementary Information Section 8. Scale bars, 20 nm. c, Five-dimensional hyperspace of yields of styrene oxide reconstructed by spectral unmixing. d, Five-dimensional hyperspace of selectivity of styrene oxide reconstructed by spectral unmixing. e, At least five PBAs (red markers 1–5 here and black circles in the corresponding hyperspace in c) showed yield–selectivity properties better than previously studied PBAs (blue markers), as well as some other controls (grey markers: Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Fe(CN)63+, Co(CN)63− and the last one without any catalyst; see raw data in Supplementary Table 34). f, The robotically reconstructed hyperspace allowed for the identification of four products unreported in previous PBA studies of this reaction (20d, 20e, 20f and 20g shown on green backgrounds) and for the reconstruction of the reaction's mechanistic network involving four intermediates 20h, 20i, 20j and 20k. The blue fishhook arrows on species 20d indicate the electron flow to furnish aldehyde 20b (R = t-BuOO, t-BuO or HO), whereas the purple fishhook arrows on species 20k indicate the electron flow to furnish epoxide 20c (ref. 56). For the generation of radicals from tert-butyl hydroperoxide, see Supplementary Information Section 8.7.

With these capabilities, we began to explore and analyse hyperspaces of several classic reaction types differing in mechanistic complexity. In doing so, we focused on yield distributions at reaction time of several hours (that is, the situation relevant to synthetic organic practice) and on hyperspace regions featuring maximal degree of variability (as opposed to regions in which, for example, concentrations are so high that yields are all ‘saturated'; see Supplementary Fig. 121). For clarity, in Figs. 2–6, we plot only the subsets of data points, with all raw data available at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14880579).

Starting simple, we considered the spaces of the E1 elimination and SN1 substitution23,24 using, respectively, substrates 13a and 14a. The space of E1 was examined at t = 4 h for 775 conditions and that of SN1 at t = 48 h for 930 conditions. The three-dimensional yield distributions shown in Fig. 2c,d for reaction products 13b and 14b are approximately concave, steadily increasing towards the global maximum (in bimolecular SN1, there is shoulder maximum in the region in which the concentration of the limiting reagent 14a is low; see also Extended Data Fig. 2). Mathematically, the ‘steepness' of these surfaces can be quantified by the slopes of the product concentration with respect to the initial concentration of substrate(s), Dij = ∂Ci/∂C0,j—as shown in Supplementary Fig. 166, the absolute values of these slopes, |Dij| are small, at or below unity. Analysis of residuals detects no anomalies and, under all conditions, only substrates and the product are present in various proportions (for example, E1 is not accompanied by SN1 side reaction). Of note, yield data contained in the ‘cubes' allow for fitting approximate kinetic models (by time-integrating the underlying kinetic equations) and for deriving reasonable values of some kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, such as ΔH, ΔH‡ or ΔS (see caption to Fig. 2, Methods and Supplementary Information Sections 5.1 and 5.2 for derivations). Even though the data correspond to only one time point, the abundance of yield values for various substrate concentrations imposes hundreds of constraints against which a candidate model must simultaneously fit, thus limiting the acceptable parameters of the model. In the ‘A four-dimensional hyperspace' section, we will use this approach to interrogate more complex mechanisms.

Next, we revisited the SN1 reaction but with 15a used as a substrate (Fig. 3a). The main product 15b forms through the rearrangement of the carbocation 15c, and its yield distribution over the 1,085 conditions fits closely to the expected first-order kinetics (see caption to Fig. 3b). The algorithm also detects a minor anthraquinone by-product 15d congruent with the Diels–Alder reaction with singlet-state oxygen25,26 and distributed as illustrated in Fig. 3c. Most notably, analysis of residuals (Fig. 1i) provides the first example of a systematic anomaly and an unexpected outcome in a narrow region of low HBr concentrations marked in pink in Fig. 3d. This species exhibits an intensely pink colour that gradually wanes over two days (and disappears rapidly during purification attempts). Its UV-Vis spectrum (Fig. 3e) does not agree with absorption spectra of 15c or structurally similar carbocations27,28,29, but extensive analyses based on MS as well as time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations (Supplementary Information Sections 4.13 and 6.2) support assignment as a carbocation dimer 15e resulting from a reaction between 15c and 15a (with enough HBr to create 15c, but with the amount of water introduced by this HBr insufficient to quench the intermediate into 15b). To our best knowledge, dimerization of a substrate with its own derived carbocationic intermediate has only been observed under superacidic conditions at temperatures down to −50 °C (ref. 30) but never in the presence of quenching nucleophiles (here H2O and Br−) and under ambient conditions. We emphasize, however, that even with the presence of this anomaly, the hyperspace remains simple—that is, each of its constituent species features only one yield maximum—and the yield distributions of all species are slowly varying, |Dij| ≈ 1 (Supplementary Information Fig. 166), including 15e, which forms over a narrow range but in only approximately 1 nM concentration.

In search for more topologically complex hyperspaces, we turned to reactions that involve more than two substrates and are based on much more complex mechanisms. As the first case, we interrogated a four-component Ugi-type reaction from ref. 31, illustrated in Fig. 4 and chosen because of distinct UV-Vis signal of the cyclized product 16e. For this cyclization reaction, 3,234 conditions were investigated within a four-dimensional space defined by different initial concentrations of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde 16a, n-butylamine 16b and p-tosylmethyl isocyanide 16c substrates (DMF substrate was also a solvent of constant concentration), as well as p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate, pTSA 16d, acting as a reaction initiator.

The hyperspace illustrated in Fig. 4a–d and Supplementary Video 3 now reveals the presence of two distinct yield maxima for the heterocyclic product 16e—a global maximum marked by a green star and a local maximum marked by a blue star. Further sampling of the conditions' grid in the region between the maxima confirms that they are separated in four-dimensional space by a region of low yield (Fig. 4j and Supplementary Figs. 160c and 161).

Notably, MS analyses (Supplementary Information Section 4.8) evidence distinct signals at these two maxima: the local maximum gives a peak m/z ratio corresponding to the iminium ion 18c expected for the classical Ugi mechanism32,33, whereas the global maximum also features a peak attributable to the oxazoline 17e. This, in turn, may suggest an extra mechanism (brown arrows) through the oxazoline 17e intermediate—alternative mechanisms for the Ugi reaction have, indeed, been postulated for decades but never proved34,35. However, such a possibility is directly disqualified by separate, ex roboto experiments in which isolated 17e fails to give product 16e on further reaction with n-butylamine in the presence of pTSA (Supplementary Information Section 4.8.4). Although other mechanisms can also be considered (see magenta arrows in Fig. 4 and corresponding caption), fitting the experimental hyperspace data to the kinetic network of 12 reactions and 15 proton transfer steps (Fig. 4i and theoretical details in Supplementary Information Section 5.3) suggests that an excellent agreement can be achieved (Fig. 4e–h) based only on the Ugi mechanism—that is, inclusion of extra mechanisms offers no perceptible improvement. Instead, the emergence of the two maxima can be attributed to the shifts in the equilibria underlying the network (Supplementary Information Sections 5.3.4 and 5.3.5). We also note that evolution of these maxima following changes in pTSA concentration is very gradual (Supplementary Video 3) and the yield distributions are characterized by very small ‘slopes', |Dij| ≲ 1 (Supplementary Fig. 166).

Next, we considered the classic Hantzsch pyridine synthesis (Fig. 5), studied for almost 150 years (refs. 36,37,38) and interesting for several known intermediates and competing pathways (coloured in blue in Fig. 5c). Notably, examining the four-dimensional hyperspace (concentrations of the three substrates, 26 °C and 80 °C temperatures; a total of 2,582 conditions) revealed the presence of many more components than previously thought. Their isolation required several HPLC repurification cycles performed in a closed-loop manner. Specifically, after each cycle, the newly identified substances were added to the spectral unmixing algorithm and the global fits to experimental spectra from the entire hypercube gradually improved (Fig. 5a,b); meanwhile, more fractions were selected for the next round of purification if they featured yet-unassigned signals (Supplementary Information Sections 4.9 and 4.10). After eight such fitting–purification cycles, the mismatch between the fitted and experimental spectra reached instrumental noise (dashed green line in Fig. 5a), at which point our knowledge of the hyperspace composition can, for all practical reasons, be deemed nearly complete. This knowledge spans not only the seven known species36,37,38 but also nine new ones (coloured red in Fig. 5c) that have not been reported in the classical Hantzsch reaction but can be of interest in the context of biological activity39.

By considering the causal relationships between these and other species discovered within the hyperspace, it is possible to establish the synthetic connectivity of the isolated species (Supplementary Information Section 4.10). This analysis, ultimately, reconstructs the complete network of the Hantzsch reaction detailed in Fig. 5c with key steps confirmed by further ex roboto reactions (marked by green arrows). Notably, analysis of yield distributions (with the help of HPLC, as spectral unmixing of all 16 components is no longer unique) revealed that, by adjusting substrate concentrations at 80 °C, the network can be switched between three different major products (19d, 19e, 19k), each forming in >60% yield and with maxima located at different corners of the conditions' cube (Fig. 5d–f). One of these switchovers is between the Hantzsch ester (19d) and the Petrenko-Kritschenko product (19e)40, meaning that even the so-called named reactions can, in reality, be part of the same hyperspace. Another observation is that, despite the switchovers, the individual yield distributions for individual species remain smooth, as visualized by the isosurfaces in Fig. 5d–f.

Finally, we consider a hyperspace in which dimensions correspond to systematic variations in composition. Here these compositions are the contents of different metals in the Prussian blue analogues (PBAs)41 (Fig. 6), which are perovskite-type materials described by a general formula KMB[MA(CN)6] and widely studied in the context of catalysis and energy storage42. The robot surveys a five-dimensional space defined by the contents of metals at sites MA (two types, Fe and Co) and MB (five types, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) over a uniform grid with the granularity of 0.2 (for example, Mn0.2Ni0.4Cu0.4–Fe0.6Co0.4 PBA versus Mn0.2Ni0.2Cu0.6–Fe0.4Co0.6 PBA, with molar fractions at A and B sites each summing to unity). Each of the 756 PBAs is prepared in situ by straightforward co-precipitation method (Fig. 6a,b) and is used to catalyse reaction of styrene 20a and t-BuOOH to give styrene oxide 20c (given that styrene oxide is the key intermediate to synthesize many fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals43, this reaction has been the subject of several studies using various catalysts, including PBAs44,45). Figure 6c shows the distribution of reaction yields and Fig. 6d quantifies the selectivities with respect to benzaldehyde 20b, the main by-product of the reaction. As seen, the yield hyperspace is much more corrugated than concentration–temperature hyperspaces from Figs. 2–5 and features several local yield maxima. Notably, it contains several PBA compositions that offer better yield–selectivity characteristics than previously reported PBAs44,45 or other controls (Fig. 6e). As in other examples that we considered, the hyperspace reconstruction reveals the presence of unreported intermediates and by-products and helps reconstruct a mechanistic network (Fig. 6f) that had previously remained elusive44,45,46.

One of the insights from these studies is the relatively simple structure of the concentration–temperature spaces, with yield distributions of any single species featuring, at most, two yield maxima and with the slope values |Dij| at or below unity (Supplementary Fig. 166). As described in Supplementary Information Sections 7.1 and 7.2, it can be rigorously proved that, for strongly connected, directed hypergraphs47,48 (that is, those that cannot be split into non-interacting subsets of reactions) and for first-order and pseudo-first-order reactions, |Dij| ≤ 1. For higher-order kinetics of individual reactions, the theoretical upper bound on |Dij| is too high to be practically relevant, but numerical studies of networks comprising first-order and second-order steps and no cycles confirm that |Dij| is also typically on the order of unity. A corollary to this result is that, along concentration coordinates C0,j, j = 1,…,k, the hypersurfaces can be examined faithfully at sparse intervals (see Supplementary Information Section 7.6). This, in turn, can help reduce the number of experiments during conditions' screening and optimization campaigns. For more discussion of hyperspace properties (in terms of topology, differential yields and Shannon information theory), see Supplementary Figs. 161 and 162 and Supplementary Information Section 4.12.

Naturally, these considerations do not apply to hyperspaces in which compositions are varied. For instance, different catalysts (as in Fig. 6) can lower the activation barriers substantially and to different extents. As a result, they can alter the network-wide kinetics more than changes over a limited range of concentrations or temperatures, resulting in ‘steeper' concentration derivatives and in the hyperspace featuring many local yield maxima.

The method by which we reconstructed reaction networks is loosely analogous to the approaches used in electronics to reverse-engineer a circuit inside a ‘black box' by applying inputs and analysing corresponding outputs. Here the inputs are the various substrate concentrations and temperatures and the outputs are the identities of the products found by the global analysis of the hyperspace. With the set of products identified, the ‘wiring' of the network is prescribed by the general rules of chemical reactivity. In the cases studied here, the wirings could be reconstructed relatively readily by humans but, as illustrated in Supplementary Information Section 4.11, this process can also be aided by network algorithms operating either at the level of mechanistic steps4,49 or full reactions50, thereby linking the hyperspace of conditions to the ‘space of reaction grammars'5, a link argued to be key to chemical innovation5. In this effort, the broad investigation of the hyperspace is essential, as different inputs can serve to ‘activate' or ‘deactivate' different branches of the network (by modifying reaction rates and shifting equilibria), enabling the formation of as many products as possible. This also means investigating the reaction space at stoichiometries that a human chemist might not necessarily find intuitive or relevant to a particular reaction. Here this approach more than doubled the knowledge of the Hantzsch hyperspace and we have seen similar discovery enhancements in other reactions that we have studied since then (for example, Pechmann, Biginelli). From a technical point of view, our ability to interrogate entire spaces of conditions capitalizes on the use of inexpensive (cents per sample) optical detection, which reduces the need for costly (about $45–300 per sample) HPLC/quantitative NMR analyses by a factor of several hundred (for example, one HPLC/NMR cycle per 1,085 UV-Vis experiments to reconstruct the SN1 network in Fig. 3; eight closed-loop cycles to ensure complete knowledge of the Hantzsch space examined by UV-Vis at 2,582 conditions). As long as the equilibrium is not fully reached (Supplementary Figs. 154 and 160), sweeping the reaction rates through control of starting concentrations accesses the type of data similar to conventional kinetic experiments (that ‘sweep' the time to observation instead) and estimation of kinetic parameters becomes possible.

A related aspect is the practical ability to direct these reaction networks towards desired outcomes by simply adjusting concentrations (that is, without using different reagents, as done in some recent excellent papers, such as ref. 51). For simple reactions, such stoichiometric control is, of course, well known (for example, we can influence the ratio of monosubstituted to disubstituted product of alkyl dibromide by using one versus two equivalents of the nucleophile). However, for multicomponent reaction mixtures, it is less obvious that they can be pushed cleanly towards different major products. We have seen this capability realized for the Hantzsch reaction, in which the yields of major products 19d, 19e and 19k were maximized at concentration ratios very different from those we may expect based on product stoichiometry alone. For instance, product 19e incorporates one copy of substrate 19a, two copies of 19b and two copies of 19c, but in the hyperspace in Fig. 5e, the regions of appreciable yield, >40%, start from about 1:4.5:2 ratio (and continue for even higher molar excess of 19b at the yield maximum, which, however, becomes wasteful in terms of substrate use; see Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Information Section 4.17).

In conclusion, this work is an initial effort—made possible by modern reaction automation—to understand the structure of reaction hyperspaces, one of the five foundational spaces of mathematical chemistry5. It reinforces the view of chemical reactions as networks4,51,52 embedded in multidimensional spaces of conditions and, at least in some cases, switchable between different major products, which is reminiscent of some biochemical networks53,54 and promising in terms of diversity-oriented synthesis55. The rapid and cost-effective approach to hyperspace reconstruction can (1) systematize and accelerate reaction discovery and optimization and (2) foster fundamental research on reaction networks as dynamic systems. This effort can be aided by hyperspace visualization and analysis tools such as those we developed and make available at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14880579; see also Supplementary Video 4). In a broader context, inclusion of our experimental yield maps to the benchmarks used for testing the general-purpose yield optimization algorithms9,11,15 would appreciably widen the diversity of these benchmarks, given the current scarcity of such datasets7,9,13,15. In future work, we aim to extend our robotic platform to reactions that require solid dispensing and/or strictly oxygen-free conditions (this will broaden the scope of hyperspaces we can analyse), to accelerate dispensing and measuring operations (to analyse fast reactions) and also to monitor hyperspace evolution over time, which will be necessary to reconstruct highly nonlinear mechanisms (for example, oscillating reactions).

Reagent addition was carried out using a commercial pipetting module (ZEUS, Hamilton), optimized for pipetting a range of organic solvents in aliquots ranging from 10 µl to 1 ml, with volumetric errors of less than 1% for volumes greater than 50 µl and less than 2% for volumes between 10 and 50 µl. Liquids were dispensed into 2-ml glass vials arranged in custom-designed 54-well plates, with each reaction typically set to a final volume of 500 µl. Following reagent addition, vials were hermetically sealed using a flat lid, with a rubber sheet and perfluoroalkoxy film placed between the lid and the vial. Initial mixing was performed on an orbital shaker at 250 rpm for 5 min. Subsequent stirring is omitted, as separate studies (see Supplementary Information Sections 2.9 and 4.5) have shown that, for vials of these dimensions, passive mixing over the course of the reaction (hours) is as efficient as mechanical stirring, thereby eliminating the need for cumbersome stir bars.

After reactions were run for desired times, the crude mixture from each vial was, if necessary, automatically diluted to align with the detection range of the UV-Vis spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The operation of the spectrophotometer was also automated, including lid opening and closing, along with the flushing and drying of the measuring pedestal (see Supplementary Video 2). All of these operations were orchestrated by house-written software. The entire assembly was placed inside a hood and, if needed, constantly purged with nitrogen. The manual operations in the entire workflow were changing the 54-well plates, covering them with rubber/perfluoroalkoxy sheets and placing on the orbital shaker. For some hyperspaces, two such systems were used. Further technical details and the blueprints for system replication are provided in Supplementary Information Section 2 and at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14880579)57. The software design is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 2 and the source code is deposited at https://github.com/yaroslavsobolev/robowski-maps.

The full cubes of 775 E1 conditions (five temperatures, 16–36 °C; five initial substrate concentrations, 1.5–15.0 mM; 31 HBr concentrations, 0.1–10.0 mM; reaction time: 4 h) and 930 SN1 conditions (six temperatures; 16–66 °C; five 9-butyl-9H-fluoren-9-ol substrate concentrations, 0.03–0.30 M; 31 HBr concentrations; reaction time: 48 h) are provided in Supplementary Information Section 4.15, with all raw data in the Zenodo repository.

Stoichiometry constraints, as shown in Fig. 1e, were included into the spectral unmixing algorithm by modifying the log-likelihood function L to be minimized: L is a sum of squared spectral mismatch (yellow) of experimental Ameasured(λ) and modelled Amodel(λ) absorbances, divided by the instrumental variance of the spectrophotometer σ2(λ, Ameasured(λ)), and the term representing the violation of stoichiometric inequalities (red) containing the Heaviside function θ(x) and the experimental uncertainties \({\sigma }_{{[{\rm{A}}]}_{0}}\) and \({\sigma }_{{[{\rm{B}}]}_{0}}\) of preparing the reaction mixture with given starting concentrations. See Supplementary Information Section 3 for more details about the spectral unmixing algorithm

The isosurfaces in Figs. 2–5 were extracted by the marching cubes algorithm58 operating on a 50 × 50 × 50 regular grid obtained through the radial basis functions interpolator applied to the raw data. This method was implemented in the HyperspaceViewer software, which is provided in the Supplementary Information and is open-sourced at a GitLab repository (https://gitlab.com/az-steak/hyperspace_viewer).

The kinetic fitting in Fig. 2e,f was done by numerically integrating the equations of the mechanism and optimizing the parameters to achieve the best-fit of the model's predicted product yields simultaneously to all experimental data. This procedure gave reasonable estimates of the reactions' thermodynamic parameters: ΔH = −30.7 ± 1.4 kJ mol−1 for SN1 and \(\Delta H={81.98}_{-1.64}^{+3.52}\,{\rm{kJ}}\,{{\rm{mol}}}^{-1}\), \(\Delta S={273.8}_{-4.9}^{+10.8}\,{\rm{J}}\,{{\rm{mol}}}^{-1}\,{{\rm{K}}}^{-1}\) and \({\Delta H}^{\ddagger }={21.10}_{-0.49}^{+0.33}\,{\rm{kJ}}\,{{\rm{mol}}}^{-1}\) (transition state enthalpy) for E1. For derivations of these values and comparisons against related literature examples, see Supplementary Information Sections 5.1 and 5.2.

Initial guess of kinetic parameters (Fig. 4e–h) was provided by the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm59, kinetic equations at each condition were integrated numerically and the discrepancy against the experimental yield distribution (over the hyperspace) was minimized using the trust region reflective algorithm60. See Supplementary Information Section 5.3 for further details of the kinetic model.

PBAs were synthesized following a reported co-precipitation method61. Two stock solutions containing metal MA (Fe, Co) were prepared by dissolving K3[Fe(CN)6] or K3[Co(CN)6] in deionized water to form clear solutions of type A (0.10 M). Five stock solutions containing metal MB (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) were prepared separately by dissolving corresponding metal nitrates/chlorides (Mn(NO3)2, FeCl2, Co(NO3)2, Ni(NO3)2, Cu(NO3)2, each at 0.10 M) in the presence of trisodium citrate dihydrate (Na3C6H5O7·2H2O, 0.1125 M) in deionized water to form clear solutions of type B. Afterwards, mixing of solutions of type A and type B were performed in specified volume ratios using the automated liquid-handling system according to the target composition. For instance, for a PBA with composition Mn0.2Ni0.4Cu0.4–Fe0.6Co0.4, the sequence and volume of stock solution addition were as follows: 20 μl Mn(NO3)2, 40 μl Ni(NO3)2, 40 μl Cu(NO3)2, 60 μl K3[Fe(CN)6] and 40 μl K3[Co(CN)6]. The total volume of solutions of type A was 100 μl and the total volume of solutions of type B was also 100 μl—therefore, the total volume of each PBA solution was always 200 μl. After sealing, each 54-vial well plate housing different mixed solutions was shaken for 15 min (250 rpm) and aged at room temperature for 24 h to form PBAs.

For a typical set of styrene epoxidation reactions, the reaction stock solution was prepared as follows: first, styrene (0.50 M) and tert-butyl hydrogen peroxide (0.75 M) were dissolved in 100 ml acetonitrile. Then, 30 ml cetyltrimethylammonium bromide aqueous solution (0.25 M) was added to the mixture. Subsequently, the obtained mixture was sonicated for 5 min to obtain a homogeneous stock solution. Afterwards, the robotic system pipetted 1.3-ml aliquots of the thus prepared stock solution into the vials containing previously prepared PBAs (200 µl aqueous suspension). The reaction vials were then sealed and every reaction plate was placed on a thermal shaker (72 °C, 700 rpm) for 6 h. After reaction, when the PBAs sedimented, the robot acquired 40 µl of the supernatant from every vial, diluted it 1,000 times and then measured the UV-Vis spectrum with the NanoDrop spectrophotometer. The yield of styrene oxide (yso) and benzaldehyde (yalde) for each sample can be obtained by spectral unmixing and the selectivity of styrene, calculated by yso/(yso + yalde) × 100%, was then obtained.

a, Examples of reactions compatible (green background), borderline (yellow) and incompatible (pink) with yield determination using UV-Vis and spectral unmixing. The compatible reactions include but are not limited to Claisen–Schmidt condensation 1, Ullmann-type coupling 2, Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling 3, Cu(I)-catalysed alkyne-azide cycloaddition 4, Friedel–Crafts acylation 5, imine condensation 6, Glaser-type coupling 7 or Beckmann rearrangement 8. The Diels–Alder reaction 9 shown on yellow background is borderline in terms of the quality of unmixing (the overlap of the UV-Vis signals from the product and from dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate prevents accurate fitting, leading to an overestimation of the yield). For the Diels–Alder reaction 10 shown on red background, the band of the product (λmax < 286 nm) is obscured by the toluene solvent (λmax = 286 nm). Other reactions unsuitable for the method are, for example, SN2 reaction of alkyl bromide 11 (not absorbing above 220 nm) or condensation of dichlorodiaminobenzene with phenanthrenequinone 12 (poor solubility of the product). b, R2 = 0.96 correlation between the optically determined yields versus the yields of the same reactions determined by conventional means (HPLC for E1 from Fig. 3 and Ugi-type MCR from Fig. 4; 1H NMR for Claisen–Schmidt condensation 1 and imine condensation 6; the weights of isolated compounds for Cu(I)-catalysed alkyne-azide cycloaddition 4 and Beckmann rearrangement 8). For numerical values of each data point, see Supplementary Tables 5–7 in Supplementary Information Sections 4.3 and 4.4.

a, Taking as an example a basic bimolecular reaction A + B → C (with kinetic rate k[A][B], reaction time t = 1 and kinetic constant k = 1), the plot has the yield and concentration of C for various combinations of A and B substrates. b, The plot shows the yield surface explicitly (black curve is the boundary at which the limiting reactant switches from A to B). As seen, yield—defined with respect to the concentration of the limiting reagent—tends to maximize at the boundaries of the region (orange curve in a) but the concentration of the product tends to maximize in its interior (blue curve in a). There are two implications of this ‘inverse' dependence: (1) yields at very low concentrations may be artificially high, whereas—in reality—they involve very high (wasteful) excesses of some reagents; (2) detecting and quantifying the product reliably may be compromised in such a low-concentration regime. Accordingly, in the current work—especially for the multicomponent mixtures—we have worked over concentration ranges that do not extend to very small values, thereby assuring reliable detection while avoiding highly wasteful excess ratios. Such a ‘practical' range is shown schematically in a by the dashed vertical lines. Another corollary is that discovery of unexpected products may be severely compromised when using a strategy of investigating only the edges and boundaries of an n-dimensional region while leaving the interior unexplored—a strategy that may otherwise seem intuitive to a chemist and has some merit in maximization of the yield of known products. c,d, Comparison of final concentration map (c) to yield map (d) for product 19e in Hantzsch reaction. Note the difference between the conditions that maximize concentration versus ones that maximize yield: yield is maximized at the vertices of the cube, whereas concentration is maximized in the middle of the front face and top edge, with higher concentrations protruding deeper into the interior of the cube (see blue curve in a). The isosurfaces correspond to 5 mM, 10 mM, 15 mM, 20 mM, 25 mM and 30 mM concentrations of 19e in c, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% and 60% yields of 19e in d and are calculated as explained in the caption of Fig. 2c,d.

Among the many types of qubit presently being investigated for a future quantum computer, silicon spin qubits with millions of qubits on a single chip are uniquely positioned to enable quantum computing. However, it has not been clear whether the outstanding high-fidelity operations and long coherence times shown by silicon spin qubits fabricated in academic settings1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 can be reliably reproduced when the qubits are manufactured in a semiconductor foundry9,10,11. Here we show precise qubit operation of silicon two-qubit devices made with standard semiconductor tooling in a 300-mm foundry environment. Of the key metrics, single- and two-qubit control fidelities exceed 99% for all four devices, and the state preparation and measurement fidelities reach up to 99.9%, as evidenced by gate set tomography. We report spin lifetime and coherence up to T1 = 9.5 s, \({T}_{2}^{* }=40.6\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\) and \({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}=1.9\,{\rm{ms}}\). We determine that residual nuclear spin-carrying isotopes contribute substantially to operational errors, identifying further isotopic purification as a clear pathway to even higher performance.

The early academic successes of silicon spin-qubit technology1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 created enthusiasm for the idea that these qubits could be fabricated in industrial 300-mm manufacturing lines9,10,11,12. Potential advantages include the ability to leverage advanced fabrication processes, to integrate qubits with modern electronics and to benefit from the existing capabilities of mass manufacturing at low costs12. Over the past decade, there have been a number of proposals for potential architectures that could be used to realize a scalable quantum computer based on silicon spin qubits13,14,15,16,17.

However, recent attempts to fabricate spins-in-silicon quantum dots using industrial-scale fabrication has raised awareness about the material challenges that must be faced. For example, it is crucial to reduce the charge noise and static disorder arising due to defects and traps at interfaces and oxides18,19,20. High-fidelity single-qubit operations can be performed with minimal impact from charge noise because the electron spin couples to the noisy electric fields only through its weak spin–orbit effects21,22,23,24,25. By contrast, other operations, including qubit initialization, read-out and exchange-based two-qubit gates, are more sensitive to the charge noise present in conventional metal–oxide–semiconductor gate stacks19,24.

This sensitivity has motivated the search for ways of mitigating the effects of charge noise, including moving spin states away from the interface to quantum wells26,27. However, from a scaling perspective, it is desirable to reconcile as much as possible conventional complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) processes with qubit fabrication to leverage the mature CMOS industry to the fullest extent. Moreover, the formation of quantum dots against thin oxides has several benefits, such as a large electric field that leads to large valley splitting18,28,29 and efficient electrostatic coupling between the gate voltage bias and the channel, allowing for well-isolated states, efficient exchange coupling control29 and fast gate-based read-out30.

In this work, we study four two-qubit devices fabricated using a long-established CMOS geometry, namely a planar metal–oxide–semiconductor with polysilicon gates31. We demonstrate for all devices all basic qubit operations, including one- and two-qubit gates, initialization and read-out, with error rates approaching and surpassing the fault-tolerance threshold for the widely studied surface error correction code32. We obtain these error rates using state-of-the-art gate set tomography (GST) tools33,34, allowing us to pinpoint effects such as crosstalk and the breakdown between stochastic and coherent errors. Our studies indicate unprecedented reproducible low error levels while also identifying clear pathways to further reducing errors.

The qubit devices were designed by Diraq and fabricated at imec in a 300-mm spin-qubit process flow that is described in Methods. The resulting wafer consists of several devices covering a range of feature sizes and configurations. We chose the design that we estimated would have optimal device parameters, and we tested four of these devices (denoted A–D). The design consists of a double quantum dot and a nearby single-electron transistor (SET) for spin read-out1 (Fig. 1a).

a, Schematic of a Diraq two-qubit device fabricated on a 300-mm wafer, showing the full wafer, single die and single device level. b, Charge stability diagram of device A as a function of plunger (P1 and P2) voltage detuning ΔVP = ΔVP1 = −ΔVP2 and exchange gate (J) voltage VJ, showing four isolated electrons in the double-dot system. Devices B–D were also measured in the (3,1) charge configuration and showed analogous charge stability diagrams. Voltage points for single-qubit operation (Joff < 1 kHz), two-qubit operation (Jon ≈ 1 MHz) and read-out are shown as a triangle, inverted triangle and star, respectively. The faint charge transition starting from VJ = 1.05 V is very weakly coupled to the quantum dot and probably corresponds to charge movement outside the active dot confinement area. In device D, we observed similar charge movements outside the active dot region; devices B and C showed none. Inset, Cross section of the double-quantum-dot device indicating the number of electrons under the plunger gates (P1 and P2), exchange gate (J) and double potential well. Scale bars, 100 nm (a, top), 10 mm (a, middle), 300 mm (a, bottom). a.u., arbitrary units.

We operated the devices in a 3He/4He dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of 10 mK in isolated mode, with four electrons in the double dot formed under the plunger gate electrodes (P1 and P2). A voltage applied to an interstitial exchange gate (J) controlled the tunnel coupling between the dots1,35,36. The electrons were loaded from a two-dimensional electron gas formed under the reservoir gate, which overlaps with an n++ implanted ohmic region. The Pauli spin blockade at the (3,1)–(4,0) charge transition was used for spin parity read-out and the signal was measured using the SET in d.c. mode (Fig. 1b). SET charge-noise measurements reveal a 1/fα power spectral density with α between 0.50(7) and 1.19(5) and an amplitude of 0.79(4)–\(0.98(7)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{eV}}/\sqrt{{\rm{Hz}}}\) at 1 Hz (Extended Data Fig. 1), in line with previous low charge-noise results from devices fabricated using similar methods19,21.

A static magnetic field B0 in the range 0.662–0.7 T split the spin states to form the single-qubit states, which were manipulated with on-resonance microwave signals applied to the electron spin resonance antenna with frequency fESR. Single-qubit Xπ/2 gates were formed with timed microwave pulses on resonance with the qubit Larmor frequencies fL,Q1 and fL,Q2 (Fig. 2), whereas Zπ/2 gates were implemented as virtual gates through rotations of the reference frame37. The single-qubit metrics, including spin lifetime and Ramsey and Hahn coherence times, for the four devices are shown in Table 1.

Real-time feedback is implemented to counteract the Larmor frequency deviation39. The local oscillator frequency is set to fLO = 18.610 GHz. The microwave power applied to qubit 1 is approximately 7% larger than that to qubit 2 resulting in matching Rabi frequencies of fRabi = 658.6(3) kHz.

Figure 3 details our implementation of two-qubit control. A voltage pulse, typically of duration tCZ between 100 ns and 500 ns, was applied to the J gate to control the exchange interaction strength (Fig. 3a–c). We performed the two-qubit gate at the symmetric charge operation point to reduce the sensitivity to the detuning noise38 (Fig. 3d). We extracted from the fitted exchange frequencies in Fig. 3c an exchange controllability of 18.4 dec V−1 (devices A–D are compared in Fig. 3e). By combining a pulsed exchange interaction with single-qubit phase rotations, we were able to implement a controlled-Z (CZ) two-qubit gate1 (Fig. 3f,g). Using real-time feedback, we tracked and corrected the SET voltage operation point and the single-qubit Larmor and Rabi frequencies39 (see Extended Data Fig. 3 for details). We used a heralded initialization protocol to check if the qubit system was successfully initialized in the \(| \downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) state, and we repeated the initialization if unsuccessful7,40.

The power and duration of the microwave burst are roughly calibrated to a single-qubit π rotation. The local oscillator frequency is set to fLO = 18.610 GHz. The mixed odd state is initialized with a tramp = 1 μs ramp at VJ = 0.96 V over the anti-crossing and the even state with heralded initialization based on a tramp = 1 μs ramp at VJ = 1.12 V. All experiments throughout the paper were conducted with an even state \(| \downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) initialization, unless otherwise specified. c, Controlled phase (CZ) oscillation as a function of exchange time texchange and exchange gate voltage VJ. We apply dynamical decoupling by a consecutive π rotation on both qubits to filter out other phase-accumulating effects, such as Stark shift. d, Decoupled exchange oscillation fingerprint for fixed exchange time texchange = 10 μs as a function of plunger voltage detuning ΔVP and exchange gate voltage VJ. The triangle indicates the exchange gate voltage used for the CZ gate. e, Exchange strength as a function of exchange gate voltage extracted from fitting exchange oscillations in c. The controllability is fitted assuming Jexchange ∝ a exp bVJ, resulting in a range between b = 9.78 dec V−1 and 18.44 dec V−1 across devices A–D. The variation in exchange controllability across the devices is probably due to fabrication variability. f,g, Calibration of the CZ single-qubit phase correction by preparing the target spin in superposition, applying a CPHASE followed by a virtual phase rotation for qubits 1 (f) and 2 (g)4,7. Vertical lines indicate the phase values for which the spin state of Q1 (Q2) is flipped if Q2 (Q1) is in the on/spin-up state. The read-out probability is unscaled in all data.

To precisely capture errors in qubit operation, we designed a GST experiment comprising the full gate set {II, XI, IX, ZI, IZ, CZ}, from which we constructed a list of ‘preparation' and ‘measurement fiducials' circuits. Combining these fiducials with ‘germ' circuits up to length 16, we obtained a list of 12,263 unique sequences34. We chose GST as the benchmarking method because it yields the error taxonomy with specific error channels and is generally a higher bar for fidelities than the more commonly used interleaved randomized benchmarking, which often overestimates fidelities8.

We implemented an idle gate with a total idle time equal to the duration of a CZ gate. Single-qubit gates in the two-qubit context were achieved by rotating one qubit π/2 around the \(\widehat{x}\) axes (XI and IX) and \(\widehat{z}\) axes (ZI and IZ), while the other qubit was idling. The XI and IX gates were implemented by applying a microwave square pulse of around 400 ns, including a 20-ns smooth sine ramp, at fL,Q1 and fL,Q2 for qubits 1 and 2, respectively. The ZI and IZ gates were implemented by virtually rotating the reference frame for qubits 1 and 2, respectively. The entangling two-qubit CZ gate was implemented by applying a voltage pulse to the exchange gate J for a duration of tCZ.

Figure 4 breaks down the error generators and their contribution to the infidelity for each gate and device. Across all four devices operation accuracies are above 99%. For example, for device A, the gate fidelities are 99.45(5)%, 99.55(4)%, 99.95(4)%, 99.96(4)%, 99.74(9)% and 99.37(5)% for the XI, IX, ZI, IZ, II and CZ, respectively (see first row of Table 1). The combined state preparation and measurement (SPAM) fidelity even exceeds 99.9% with FSPAM = 99.95(8)%, which is one of the highest reported values for industrially fabricated spin qubits (Extended Data Fig. 4). Single-qubit on-target gate fidelities FX,Q1 = 99.97(15)% and FX,Q2 = 99.81(11)% are comparable to previously reported values for devices made using the same fabrication processes21.

a–d, Infidelity contributions of Hamiltonian and stochastic error generators across all four devices for the XI (a), IX (b), II (c) and CZ (d) gates from GST. Hamiltonian errors contribute to the infidelity in second order, whereas stochastic errors contribute in first order. Stochastic errors, particularly the idling ZI and IZ error generator components, dominate the infidelity by more than an order of magnitude. All gate fidelities across all devices are above 99%. Error bars represent the 95% confidence level. For visibility, only those of the IZ and ZI error generators are displayed.

All four devices have fidelities of 99% or higher across all operations, with XI (IX), ZI (IZ) and CZ gates ranging between 99.23(3)% and 99.59(15)% (99.18(5)% and 99.64(3)%), between 99.95(5)% and 99.97(3)% (99.95(5)% and 99.97(3)%) and between 99.04(16)% and 99.56(6)% (Table 1). Furthermore, the stochastic IZ and ZI error generators dominate the infidelity contributions across all devices. In particular, the stochastic IZ component is larger for the CZ gate compared with the I gate, which is probably related to the (3,1) charge configuration used in all devices. In future work, a systematic study of the (1,3) charge configuration, as well as higher electron occupations such as (3,3) across several devices, would provide valuable insights into the physical origin of the observed error mechanisms. SPAM fidelities reproducibly exceed 99.9% for three out of the four devices (devices A, C and D). For device B, we achieved a SPAM fidelity of 99.33(9)%. We attribute this slightly reduced SPAM fidelity to signs of gate leakage between the SET barrier and the ohmic contacts. Similarly, device D shows leakage between the SET barrier and the plunger gate used to form qubit 2, which is the probable cause of the reduced spin relaxation and coherence time of qubit 2 (Table 1).

Additionally, we performed d.c. cryo-probing measurements on a further 16 devices: one with the same design parameters as devices A–D and 15 with different design parameters, all from the same imec wafer. These measurements indicate excellent uniform electrostatic control over all device gate electrodes (Extended Data Fig. 5).

Device A exemplifies the high performance of qubits on the 300-mm wafer and can, therefore, be used as a case study to examine the sources of infidelity. In the following sections, we analyse the GST error contributions and their probable physical origins in device A, as well as its qubit performance as a function of magnetic field. Based on the consistency of the dominating errors reported in Fig. 4 and the similarity of the Larmor frequency dynamics in Extended Data Fig. 3, we expect this conclusion to hold for all four devices.

The ZI and IZ gates were implemented virtually and are, therefore, in principle error-free. However, the clock update on the field-programmable gate array took a finite time, leading to slight imperfections in these virtual operations due to idling errors. Hence, we attribute their infidelities, 0.05(4)% (0.04(4)%) for ZI (IZ), to a small time delay in the control hardware.

Most importantly, the largest contribution to infidelity for the XI, II and CZ gates is the stochastic IZ error generator, whereas the IX gate is limited by the stochastic ZI error generator, with the second highest contribution being the stochastic IZ error generator, followed by the stochastic IY error generator (Fig. 4). The stochastic dephasing error generator of the qubit undergoing a π/2 rotation (ZI for the XI gate and IZ for the IX gate) is significantly larger for the IX gate than for the XI gate. However, for the idle qubit (IZ for the XI gate and ZI for the IX gate), it is significantly larger for the XI gate than for the IX gate. Similarly, the infidelity contribution to the II gate from the stochastic dephasing error generator IZ (0.15%) is larger than for ZI (0.09%).

First, these error contributions could be explained by the coupling of 29Si nuclear spins to the electron spin state of qubit 2 (ref. 41). Qubit 1 also experiences quasi-static changes in the Larmor frequency, but these are of lower magnitude, despite the Stark shifts of qubit 1 being larger (Extended Data Fig. 3). This is another indication that hyperfine-coupled residual 29Si nuclear spins are the origin of that noise. As expected, these idling errors are roughly doubled (tXI = tIX = 400 ns) in comparison with the idling gate, which only takes around half the time. Comparing the II gate with the CZ gate, the stochastic ZI error generator remains constant (0.09%), but the IZ error generator more than doubles (0.40%), despite both gates having the same duration tII = tCZ = 212 ns. However, during CZ gate operation, the tunable exchange barrier is lowered to enable the Heisenberg exchange. This leads to a shift in the centre of the electron wavefunction, possibly moving qubit 2 closer to the 29Si nuclear spin, thus increasing the contact hyperfine interaction and the quasi-static noise in IZ.

Second, it might seem contradictory that the gate infidelity is dominated by noise in qubit 2, given that \({T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}} > {T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}1}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\) and \({T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}2}^{* }\approx {T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}1}^{* }\). However, the GST experiments are designed to amplify, not echo out, persistent noise sources. They are, therefore, heavily affected by slow noise, such as Larmor frequency changes arising from hyperfine-coupled nuclear spins. On the other hand, Hahn echo experiments are limited by fast charge noise. The Larmor frequency variation, tracked during the GST experiment using real-time feedback39,40, shows a higher standard deviation for the qubit 2 frequency variation compared with qubit 1 (Extended Data Fig. 3). Furthermore, the infidelities of the XI, IX, II and CZ gates decrease for higher Larmor feedback rates, with the main contribution again being the stochastic IZ error generator for the XI, II and CZ and the stochastic ZI error generators for the IX gate (Extended Data Fig. 6).

Third, sequences between which the Larmor frequency feedback exhibits a large frequency change can be removed from the GST dataset, but this has a significant effect only on the stochastic IZ error generator of the XI gate (Extended Data Fig. 7). Moreover, the spread of the Larmor frequency is independent of B0, whereas the Stark shift increases linearly (Extended Data Figs. 8 and 9) and the spin–orbit interaction in qubit 1 is stronger compared with qubit 2, as can be seen in Fig. 3a,b. The standard deviation of the Larmor frequency feedback increases in a step-like manner as a function of total experiment runtime for distinct instances across all magnetic fields (Extended Data Fig. 10). Hence, these slow timescale jumps probably originate from qubit 2 coupling strongly to the nuclear spin states of the residual 29Si atoms. As such, they contribute significantly to the gate infidelities and are the cause of the above-described observations2,42,43. These slow jumps in the Larmor frequency do not contribute to \({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\) and, therefore, do not contradict \({T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}} > {T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}1}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\).

In terms of qubit device performance, Fig. 5 shows spin lifetime and coherence metrics as functions of the magnetic field B0. T1 and \({T}_{2}^{* }\) first increase up to B0 = 0.3–0.4 T, followed by a decrease for larger B0. Because \({T}_{2}^{* }\) is sensitive to d.c. noise, it samples 1/f noise down to frequencies corresponding to the total time of the experiment, which renders it a bad metric for comparing different qubits or qubit platforms. Including Larmor frequency feedback in the experiment reduces the contribution of low-frequency 1/f noise44. We demonstrate this in Extended Data Fig. 11a,b by plotting \({T}_{2}^{* }\) as a function of the cumulative measurement time. Most curves are approximately flat, showing the effectiveness of the feedback mechanism. Extended Data Fig. 11c,d show the variation of \({T}_{2}^{* }\) as a function of laboratory time.

a–c, Spin lifetime T1 (a), Ramsey \({T}_{2}^{* }\) (b) and Hahn echo \({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\) (c) metrics as functions of the applied magnetic field amplitude B0. We measured both qubits for each experiment interleaved and repeated this 50 (T1), 10,000 (\({T}_{2}^{* }\)) and 2,000 (\({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\)) times. Ramsey experiments at B0 = 0.05 T, 0.1 T, 0.8 T and 1.1 T were repeated 50,000, 100,000, 50,000 and 40,000 times. The Hahn echo experiment at B0 = 1.3 T was repeated 500 times. Between each repeat we used real-time Larmor frequency feedback following the protocol described in ref. 39. The data were fitted using the functions described in Extended Data Fig. 2. Data shown as stars correspond to metrics measured during two-qubit benchmarking (Extended Data Fig. 2), using a method and gate voltages that differed from those used for the magnetic field sweep. Error bars represent the 95% confidence level.

The longest measured coherence times for device A include Hahn echo coherence time \({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}=\text{1,900}\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\) (1,805 μs) for qubit 2 (qubit 1) measured at the low magnetic field of B0 = 50 mT, as well as \({T}_{2}^{* }\) = 40.6 μs (39.0 μs) and T1 = 9.5 s (4.7 s). The long \({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\) and its small variation between both qubits indicate that magnetic noise dominates at low fields. On increasing B0, the Stark shift increases linearly (Extended Data Fig. 9), with steeper slopes for qubit 1 (ΔΩStark(P1, J, P2) = (−19.9(4), 31.3(3), 14.2(4)) MHz V−1 T−1) than for qubit 2 ((0, 3.2(2), 16.7(4)) MHz V−1 T−1), manifesting in stronger coupling to charge noise through the spin–orbit interaction and resulting in reduced coherence, with a 33% larger \({T}_{2,Q2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}=617(26)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\) (\({T}_{2,Q1}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}=464(22)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\)) at B0 = 1.3 T. The observed Stark shift is entirely caused by the intrinsic spin–orbit coupling of silicon electrons confined at the Si/SiO2 interface. For device A, the external magnetic field points in the [110] lattice orientation, where the variability of the g factor is highest and the Dresselhaus spin–orbit component dominates. This type of spin–orbit coupling is largely influenced by atomistic roughness at the Si/SiO2 interface29. In the presence of a gate bias, the quantum dot moves under the rough interface, shifting its g factor. The magnitude and sign of the resulting Stark shift depends on the direction in which the gate moves the quantum dot. Typical values range between −80 MHz V−1 T−1 to 80 MHz V−1 T−1 (ref. 25). In device A, we obtained −20 MHz V−1 T−1 to 30 MHz V−1 T−1, which falls within that range. The magnetic field dynamics of the spin coherence times are distinct from previous results for academic devices7, and the exact physical origin requires a more detailed study, which is beyond the scope of this work.

Looking forward, the increase in \({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\) for low fields is extremely encouraging because it indicates that the qubits are amenable to more scalable control techniques. Such approaches continuously drive the spin by using a modulated microwave field to decouple it from noise and eliminate free precession (\({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\gg {T}_{2}^{* }\))36,45. Operation at lower fields requires a different modality of the two-qubit gate. To achieve similarly fast gates, a SWAP-like operation will be implemented. Furthermore, at low fields an always-on, global control is beneficial for avoiding idling errors and using the long decoupling times \({T}_{2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}\gg {T}_{2}^{* }\) observed. This can be achieved by aligning the magnetic field direction such that the Larmor frequencies of the qubits become degenerate45. The key challenge for that operation modality is sufficiently large Stark shifts.

Our chosen implementation of an entangling gate (CZ) is faster than decoupling schemes, but it relies on the exchange interaction being smaller than the Zeeman energy difference of the two qubits (Jexc ≪ ΔEZ). We chose B0 values in the range 0.662–0.7 T to meet this requirement, but in future, we intend to explore other two-qubit gate implementations8.

We have demonstrated high-fidelity control of semiconductor qubits industrially manufactured in a 300-mm pilot line. In contrast to previous publications in which charge noise is identified as the key limiting factor3,4,5,8,38,46,47, our results are strongly encouraging from a noise-analysis perspective, both in terms of the fidelity values themselves, and in view of the clear pathway they pave towards further improvement through further nuclear purification. Further isotopic enrichment of the 400-ppm 29Si used in this work to levels at or below 50 ppm has already been demonstrated in academic prototype devices7. This is consistent with previous results showing the effect of nuclear spin noise on coherence times in Si/SiGe quantum-dot spin qubits20.

We have shown that using engineering practices in an industrial setting can lead to state-of-the-art spin-qubit performance when coupled with a systematic search for target performance metrics. It is crucial to understand the connection between qubit performance and measurements that can be performed during the fabrication process, such as electrical noise and Hall bar transport19,48. These investigations are in their infancy and will require an increasingly accurate model of the quantum behaviour of electrons in semiconductor devices.

In the long term, further improvements will be required on the qubit front, for which our noise analysis provides a first-order angle of attack. To reduce the overhead for fault-tolerant quantum computing32, 99.9% fidelities across all operations is a realistic target.

At this stage, a statistical analysis of these qubits at a larger scale is not yet available. The consistent calibration of qubits at the level demonstrated here remains an intensive manual process with a number of scientific insights gained along the way. Automation of this process needs to mature to consistently achieve these results in a mass-characterization campaign49. Having silicon–metal–oxide–semiconductor (SiMOS) qubits fabricated in a foundry environment readily available will facilitate the future demonstration of large-scale SiMOS qubit arrays. This has so far been challenging for SiMOS spin qubits because it has been difficult to fabricate devices with small gate pitches and low charge-noise interfaces.

These results could be leveraged to design quantum error correction strategies to cater to the specific demands of spin qubits. However, further studies will be needed to characterize qubit operations in a more scalable setting, such as under a single global microwave field and under elevated temperatures, which will inevitably be imposed by the heat dissipated by the co-integrated control electronics on the CMOS chip50,51,52. Our reproducible demonstrations of high-quality qubit operation made using 300-mm foundry processes offer a proof of principle that should encourage further industrial research into far more complex technologies that are at the disposal of foundries.

The fabrication method used at imec was optimized for low charge noise, high uniformity19,31,53,54 and qubit-specific integration with a gate pitch smaller than 100 nm. Fast fabrication cycles and design flexibility were ensured by optimally combining optical lithography and electron-beam lithography. Fabrication started with the epitaxial growth of an isotopically enriched layer of silicon with a residual concentration of 400 ppm 29Si. A high-quality thermally grown oxide forms the Si/SiO2 interface at which the charge of the electron spin qubit accumulates. Dedicated cleaning processes and 300-mm pilot line process control are key to the development of the high-quality interface19. Next, a triple-layer overlapping polysilicon gate stack was formed using electron-beam lithography and dry etching, with each gate separated by a thin interstitial high-temperature oxide deposit19. The highly doped polysilicon gates reduced the interface strain at cryogenic temperatures54,55. Finally, an aluminium strip line was patterned so that single spin states could be manipulated using electron spin resonance, offering a control solution at the few-qubit level50,52 (Extended Data Fig. 12).

Devices A, B, C and D were measured in Bluefors XLD400, Bluefors LD400, and two different Oxford Instruments K100 Kelvinox dilution refrigerators, respectively, and mounted on the cold finger. Previous work conducted with similar experimental set-ups indicates that the electron temperature was 200–300 mK (ref. 56). An American Magnetics AMI430 supplied static external magnetic fields to devices A, B and C, with the field for A pointing in the [110] direction of the Si lattice and those for B and C pointing in the [1\(\overline{1}\)0] direction. The field for device D was supplied by an Oxford Instruments IPS120-10 pointing in the [1\(\overline{1}\)0] direction of the Si lattice.

We used a Q-Devil QDAC-II to supply d.c. voltages through filtered lines with a bandwidth of up to 20 Hz. Dynamic voltage pulses were generated with a field-programmable gate array, in this experiment the Quantum Machines Operator-X+ (OPX+). The pulses were combined with d.c. biases using custom linear bias combiners at room temperature. The OPX+ had a sampling time of 1 ns.

The dynamic pulse lines in the fridge had a bandwidth of up to 50 MHz, which translated into a minimum rise time of 20 ns. We accounted for this by smoothing out fast a.c. pulsing. Microwave pulses were generated by a vector signal generator (PSG8267D, Keysight). The in-phase and quadrature and pulse modulation waveforms were generated by the OPX+.

The charge sensor comprised a single-island SET in d.c. mode. The SET current integrated for tint = 100 μs was amplified using a room-temperature I–V converter (Basel SP983c) and sampled by the OPX+. At this stage, we used d.c. mode read-out, which was limited by the bandwidth and noise of the room-temperature transimpedance amplifier, leaving high-bandwidth cryogenic current amplification for future work.

Gate times were optimized based on a trade-off between speed and lifetime. The magnetic field amplitude B0 was chosen in the range 0.662–0.7 T, such that the single-qubit Rabi QRabi = fRabiTRabi was maximized. Simultaneously, the chosen implementation of entangling gate relied on the exchange interaction being smaller than the Zeeman energy difference of the two qubits (Jexc ≪ ΔEZ). We chose our B0 values to meet this requirement.

Noise spectrum at a high and a low-sensitivity point of a Coulomb oscillation at B0 = 0.662 − 0.7 T for devices A–D. Voltage noise spectrum is first calculated using a Fast Fourier transform on extracted SET current measurements divided by the slope of the Coulomb peak, and finally converted into a charge noise spectrum in μeV using the lever arm58. Charge noise at 1 Hz ranges between \(0.79(4)-0.98(7)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{e}}{\rm{V}}/\sqrt{{\rm{H}}{\rm{z}}}\). Solid line is a power law fit of the power spectral density with exponent ranging between a = 0.50(7) − 1.19(5).

a,b, Spin relaxation of qubit 1 (a) and 2 (b) spin up to the ground state \(| \downarrow \downarrow \rangle \). Curves are fitted to an exponential decay resulting in a relaxation time of T1,Q1 = 2.4(2) s (a = 0.999, b = 0.847) and T1,Q2 = 6.3(6) s (a = 0.989, b = 1.183), respectively. For long wait times, the pure \(| \downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) state decays to its thermal equilibrium following the Fermi-Dirac distribution at finite temperatures. c,d, Ramsey experiment for qubit 1 (c) and 2 (d) fitted to a sinusoidal exponential decay resulting in a coherence time of \({T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}1}^{* }=30.2(6)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\) (a = −0.498, fdet = 95 kHz, b = 1.874, c = 0.498) and \({T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}2}^{* }=29.1(6)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\) (a = −0.488, fdet = 102 kHz, b = 1.884, c = 0.499), respectively. The oscillation is induced by a phase shift corresponding to a 100 kHz detuning. Every data point is averaged for 1,000 repeats, each integrating the readout signal for tint = 100 μs. We use real-time Larmor frequency feedback between repeats using the protocol described in ref. 39. e,f, Hahn echo experiment for qubit 1 (e) and 2 (f) fitted to an exponential decay resulting in a coherence time of \({T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}1}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}=445(6)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\) (a = 0.931, b = 1.263, c = 0.035) and \({T}_{2,{\rm{Q}}2}^{{\rm{Hahn}}}=803(6)\,{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{s}}\) (a = 0.908, b = 3.125, c = 0.040), respectively. We measure all six single qubit projections and fit the state purity γstate. Error bars represent the 95% confidence level.

a–d, Single qubit Larmor frequency deviation of qubit 1 and 2 across devices A – D (a–d) as a function of lab time during a GST experiment nominally equivalent to the ones discussed in the main text (Fig. 4). Figures are plotted with the same y-axis range. The standard deviation of the frequency feedback of qubit 2 (73–99 kHz) is larger compared to qubit 1 (27–52 kHz) across all devices. The microwave local oscillator frequency is set to fLO = 18.610−19.590 GHz (compare Table 1). Frequency feedback is implemented by following the protocol described in ref. 39.

GST-estimated SPAM operations, with the initial state represented as a density matrix and the terminating parity measurement as a POVM, yield a \(| \downarrow \downarrow \rangle \) state initialization fidelity of Finit = 99.996(49)% and an even/odd parity measurement of Fmeas = 99.959(59)%, respectively. The combined state preparation and measurement fidelity is calculated to FSPAM = 99.95(8)%. Error bars represent the 95% confidence level.

Each plot shows I–V data for 16 quantum-dot devices (coloured curves) measured with a cryo-prober at around 1 K. One device with same design parameters as devices A–D, and 15 with different design parameters, all from the same 300 mm wafer. Different panels pertain to the gate electrodes (EB1, P1, J, P2, EB2, RG, CBs) or to all gates (top left).

Gate infidelities \(1-{\mathcal{F}}\) benchmarked using GST as a function of Larmor frequency feedback rate (the frequency at which the feedback is executed and the Larmor frequency updated) at B0 = 0.666 T. We estimate the precision to be ~5 kHz, based on the deviation from the induced 100 kHz oscillations in Ramsey experiments shown in Extended Data Fig. 2. The virtual ZI and IZ gates are independent of the Larmor frequency and omitted. Each GST experiment consists of 12,263 sequences repeated 100 times. The Larmor frequency feedback circuit is executed with increasing rate, i.e. after every 3000th, 1000th, 300th, 100th, 30th, 10th, 3rd, and single GST gate sequence. All gate infidelities decrease with increasing Larmor frequency feedback rate. The dominant infidelity contribution to the XI, II, and CZ gate is the stochastic IZ error generator, originating from idling of qubit 2. The IX gate infidelity is dominated by the respective ZI error generator, originating from idling of qubit 1. Hamiltonian ZI and IZ error generators, not plotted here, contribute about 0.4% to the infidelity of the CZ gate. Better calibration, as done in the main text (Fig. 4), removes the Hamiltonian errors almost entirely and brings the all gate infidelities below the commonly targeted 1% infidelity threshold represented by the black dashed line. Error bars represent the 95% confidence level.

Infidelity contribution of Hamiltonian and stochastic error generators of the full gate set XI (a), IX (b), ZI (c), IZ (d), II (e), and CZ (f) comparing the effect of removing gate sequences with Larmor frequency jumps > 50 kHz in post-selection at B0 = 0.666 T using GST. Hamiltonian errors contribute to the infidelity in second order, while stochastic errors contribute in first order. The ZI and IZ gates are implemented virtually and are independent of that post selection within error bars. The original (without post-selection) GST experiment consisted of 12,263 sequences, with Larmor frequency feedback after every 10th sequence, repeated 400 times. 171 repeats passed the post-selection for analysis. Error bars represent the 95% confidence level.

Each Ramsey experiment is repeated at least 10,000 times, with Larmor frequency feedback before each repeat, corresponding to 10,000 data points and roughly 25 min. For magnetic field amplitudes of B0 = 0.05 T, 0.1 T, 0.8 T, and 1.1 T, 50,000, 100,000, 50,000, and 40,000 Ramsey repeats are measured and then truncated in post batched in chunks of 10,000 repeats displayed here shaded. Each Hahn experiment is repeated 2,000 times for all six state projections [+X,−X,+Y,−Y,+Z,−Z], with Larmor feedback between each repeat for each projection, corresponding to 12,000 data points and roughly 30 min. The Hahn echo experiment for B0 = 1.3 T is only repeated 500 times.

Protein design has focused on the design of ground states, ensuring that they are sufficiently low energy to be highly populated1. Designing the kinetics and dynamics of a system requires, in addition, the design of excited states that are traversed in transitions from one low-lying state to another2,3. This is a challenging task because such states must be sufficiently strained to be poorly populated, but not so strained that they are not populated at all, and because protein design methods have focused on generating near-ideal structures4,5,6,7. Here we describe a general approach for designing systems that use an induced-fit power stroke8 to generate a structurally frustrated9 and strained excited state, allosterically driving protein complex dissociation. X-ray crystallography, double electron–electron resonance spectroscopy and kinetic binding measurements show that incorporating excited states enables the design of effector-induced increases in dissociation rates as high as 5,700-fold. We highlight the power of this approach by designing rapid biosensors, kinetically controlled circuits and cytokine mimics that can be dissociated from their receptors within seconds, enabling dissection of the temporal dynamics of interleukin-2 signalling.

Protein–protein interactions orchestrate much of biological function. High-affinity interactions enable protein circuits to respond to low concentrations of stimuli and to act potently on targets; fast exchange enables them to respond quickly to changes in stimuli. These two properties cannot usually be achieved simultaneously in binary interactions because they depend on the interaction off-rate in opposite ways: high affinity usually requires slow dissociation (low off-rate), whereas rapid exchange requires fast dissociation (high off-rate) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Several natural systems exhibit ‘facilitated dissociation'10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20, in which an effector (E) can bind to a target–host (TH) complex to form an excited ternary complex (THE)20,21,22,23,24,25,26 from which the target dissociates quickly (Fig. 1a–c). In such a system, the target can bind tightly to the host, yet can also be rapidly released by adding the effector27. In engineered DNA systems, the kinetic control afforded by an analogous phenomenon (toehold-mediated strand displacement) has enabled the construction of many complex functions28,29, but DNA systems have limited utility for directly interfacing with biology. Protein binding and unbinding can be readily coupled to biological processes, but there has been no general approach to design kinetic control over protein interactions.

The host protein (H, subscripted by conformational state X or Y) is shown in blue, the target (T) in pink and the effector (E) in orange. d, Structural models of starting components (effector-responsive switch and arbitrary binder–target pair) combined to construct facilitated dissociation systems. e, Structural models of example proteins designed to undergo a facilitated dissociation process starting from a tightly interacting state X (left) through a structurally frustrated ternary intermediate in state Y (right, solid). State X (transparent) is included to show the conformational change. Thinner arrows indicate structural features and thicker arrows indicate state changes.

We set out to design protein systems that undergo facilitated dissociation. Given an interacting protein binder–target pair, we reasoned that we could construct host proteins with controllable dissociation kinetics by fusing an effector-responsive conformational switch to the binder such that when the effector is not bound, the target can bind normally, but in the alternate effector-bound conformation, the switch clashes with the target, leading to strain in the target–host–effector ternary complex that resolves when the target dissociates30 (Fig. 1d,e; nomenclature detailed in Supplementary Note 1). This would allosterically couple the effector and target, and facilitated dissociation could proceed through the strained ternary complex intermediate faster than spontaneous dissociation of the target in mutually exclusive competition (Fig. 1c). Crucially, the energy of this ternary intermediate must be neither too high (otherwise the facilitated dissociation pathway would not be faster) nor too low (otherwise the target would not dissociate) (Fig. 1b). To set the ternary intermediate energy within this optimal range (Supplementary Fig. 2), we reasoned that we could control the level of strain in the ternary complex by varying the geometry of the switch–binder fusion. To access this strained state effectively, we reasoned that binding the effector should rapidly drive the conformational change against the resisting force associated with generating strain. Such a ‘driven' motion would be akin to the power strokes of motor proteins: a large conformational change that is both thermodynamically and kinetically favoured (a low-barrier descent down a steep energy gradient)8,31. Compared with the mechanism of direct steric overlap between target and effector, as in many existing facilitated dissociation systems17,18,19,20,26,32, this allosteric mechanism should be quite modular: such a force-generating switch could be fused to almost any binder to enable facilitated dissociation of its target.

We began by using a previously designed effector-responsive conformational switch (hinge protein cs221; ref. 33) to test the concept of allosteric coupling by switching steric clashes between the host and the target. This switch can undergo a rigid-body hinge motion to transition from a closed state (X) to an open state (Y), and in the open state Y can bind an effector peptide quite tightly (koff = 5 × 10−6 s−1). As a model binder–target interaction, we chose a designed heterodimer pair (LHD101 (ref. 34) modified as described in Supplementary Fig. 3) with dissociation slow enough (koff = 9 × 10−5 s−1) to allow us to easily measure substantial effector-induced acceleration of target dissociation, but not slower than the effector dissociation so that the target would be more likely than the effector to dissociate from the ternary complex. To allosterically couple binding of the effector to dissociation of the target, we designed structured fusions of the hinge switch and binder such that when the switch is in state X, the target can bind, but when in the effector-bound state Y, it will clash strongly (Fig. 1d,e, Supplementary Fig. 4a,b and Methods). We obtained synthetic genes encoding 12 designs, expressed and purified the proteins from Escherichia coli and found that the best (allosteric switch 0; AS0) showed slow and reduced effector association in the presence of the target (Supplementary Fig. 5d), indicating the desired allosteric coupling but also the need for designs with a faster, driven pathway for effector binding against the target.

In these first designs, because the effector-binding cleft is closed in state X, the hinge switch must first transition to the open state Y before the effector can bind (a conformational selection mechanism). Because state Y clashes with the target, this conformational change is slow when the target is bound, limiting the rate of effector association and the overall rate of facilitated dissociation (Supplementary Fig. 4c). This slow step could be bypassed if the effector could instead first bind to state X and accelerate the transition to state Y. An induced-fit mechanism could provide the driving force: an intrinsically disordered effector could weakly engage with state X, and fold and make more extensive interactions in the strained ternary complex in state Y35, driving the transition in a power-stroke-like motion36,37.

Such a mechanism would require new switches that, in state X and throughout the conformational transition, retain an open effector-binding cleft where a flexible effector could associate (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 4d). Starting from AS0, we constructed a new state X by shifting the two domains from their state Y positions relative to each other (by one heptad along the helix of domain 1 that contacts domain 2), building a new loop between the domains, and optimizing single sequences that could adopt both this new state X and the original effector-bound state Y (Supplementary Fig. 4e and Methods). This approach maintains the open cleft in state X by introducing minimal rotation from state Y and simplifies the multi-state sequence-design challenge by minimizing the local structural differences between the two states. Transition between conformational states occurs by a register shift throughout which the cleft could remain open and bind the effector (Supplementary Fig. 4f). Because these new hosts retain the state Y backbone validated to clash with the target in AS0, we should observe allosteric coupling if the switch works as designed (Fig. 1e).

We obtained synthetic genes encoding ten such designs, and found that four tightly bound the effector (dissociation constant (Kd) < 1 nM; Supplementary Fig. 6d). To measure facilitated dissociation kinetics, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR): with the target affixed to the SPR surface, we incubated with the host, then measured target–host dissociation under flow of various concentrations of effector. For these four designs, the target dissociates slowly in the absence of the effector; adding the effector increases the rate of dissociation markedly (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 7), but minimally affects the target off-rate from a control static binder fusion that lacks an effector-binding site (Supplementary Fig. 7).

In the right plots of e–h, schematics show the mechanism that can be inferred from the data.

To investigate the mechanism of facilitated dissociation (Fig. 2b), we focused on AS1, the design with the tightest effector binding (Kd,H:E ≈ 10 pM). We directly measured the rate constant of target dissociation from the strained ternary complex (koff,T:HE) by flowing pre-incubated host–effector complex at a high concentration to form the strained ternary complex with the target on the SPR surface, then tracking target–host dissociation under continued flow of the effector (Fig. 2e, Supplementary Fig. 7 and Methods). In the full facilitated dissociation process, as the concentration of added effector increases, the rate constant of facilitated target dissociation approaches koff,T:HE (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 7), strongly suggesting that the ternary complex is an intermediate in the facilitated dissociation process (Fig. 2b, lower pathways).

To further analyse the mechanism of forming the strained ternary complex, we characterized facilitated dissociation with two different effectors: the peptide and a three-helix bundle ‘3hb' (3hb21; ref. 33) (Fig. 2c). The two effectors make nearly identical interactions with AS1, but when unbound, the peptide is disordered whereas the 3hb is structured (Fig. 2d). With AS1 affixed to the SPR surface, we measured the rate of effector association to form the strained ternary complex by first saturating AS1 with target, then flowing varying concentrations of effector mixed with constant excess target (to ensure that the target remains bound after effector association). The apparent on-rate for binding to the target–AS1 complex increases linearly with concentration for the peptide (Fig. 2e) but hyperbolically for the 3hb, saturating at the rate of a concentration-independent step (Fig. 2f). Notably, with the 3hb, the rate of facilitated target dissociation saturates at this same value (Fig. 2h). The simplest explanation of these results is that the rigid 3hb can only bind to the fully open state Y of AS1 and that the THX → THY conformational change is slow (owing to partial blocking by the bound target), so it becomes rate limiting for both the association with the target–AS1 complex and the overall facilitated dissociation process (Fig. 2b, middle pathway). In contrast to the 3hb, peptide effector binding (Fig. 2e) and resulting target destabilization (Fig. 2g) can both occur more rapidly than the THX → THY conformational change, suggesting that the more flexible peptide effector can bind to AS1 in state X to accelerate this conformational change through an induced-fit mechanism12,35,38 (Fig. 2b, bottom pathway).

We used X-ray crystallography to structurally characterize multiple states of our designed systems. For both the AS1 and the AS5 systems, the crystal structures of the hosts alone (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 1a) and of the host–effector complexes (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 1b) closely match the design models (maximum 1.3 Å Cα root mean square deviation (RMSD)). The unbound structures show an open hydrophobic cleft in the new designed state X poised to bind the effector, and the effector-bound structures show that binding the effector causes the two switch domains to register-shift into the designed state Y (Supplementary Note 2). Structures of the target–AS1 complex show that the target binds as designed (Fig. 3c, top), with some strain suggested by small variations among the structures (Fig. 3c, bottom, Extended Data Fig. 1c,d and Supplementary Note 3).

Bottom, detailed view of the backbone hydrogen bonding in the interfacial strand pairing. The target–AS1 complex (pink and blue) hydrogen bonds (green) are less strained than the ternary complex (grey) hydrogen bonds (red).

We next sought to determine how the target–host–effector ternary complex deforms to resolve the designed clash. At the concentrations of the components used in the above experiments, the AS1 ternary complex is an only transiently populated excited state, but at high concentrations it becomes the dominant state (Kd,T:HE = 200 nM; Supplementary Fig. 9). This enabled us to solve structures of AS1 in the ternary complex intermediate with both target and effector. In structures from two different crystals, the switch region closely matches the state Y design model, and the rest of the structure strains to resolve the structural frustration from simultaneously binding the target and occupying state Y (Fig. 3d). This strain distributes across multiple locations in the structure: the binder fusion bends, the portion of the target that directly clashes with the switch becomes disordered and the target twists at its interface, disrupting the interfacial hydrophobic packing (Fig. 3e, top) and shearing the interfacial strand pairing (Fig. 3e, bottom). Double electron–electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy (Extended Data Fig. 2) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (Extended Data Fig. 3) suggest that the ternary complex is dynamic, with varying amounts of strain at each location (Supplementary Note 3).

We next investigated the factors that contribute to the dissociation kinetics, seeking to maximize the dissociation rate enhancement by (1) reducing the base rate of target dissociation and (2) increasing the rate of facilitated dissociation. For (1), the target dissociates 20-fold faster from AS1 than from an unhindered binder fusion (Supplementary Fig. 7), probably because of minor strain in the target–AS1 complex (Extended Data Fig. 1c). For (2), with AS1, effector association can occur at least five times faster than target dissociation from the ternary complex (Fig. 2e); thus, moderately increasing the energy of the ternary complex could accelerate the target dissociation step without making the effector association rate limiting, thereby increasing the overall rate of facilitated dissociation. Assuming a simple spring model of the ternary complex, this could be achieved by deforming with a greater magnitude or in a direction of higher stiffness (Supplementary Fig. 10a).

We sought to maximize strain energy in the ternary complex by modulating the magnitude and direction of the deformation required to resolve the designed clash (Fig. 4a). Avoiding any clash in state X while maintaining a strong clash in state Y, we sampled a variety of target + binder positions relative to the switch from AS1; rebuilt fusions between the switch and the newly located binder; and selected variants that were predicted by AlphaFold2 (AF2) to have substantial deformations spanning a variety of directions (AF2 predictions of the strained AS1 ternary complex were within 1.0 Å Cα RMSD of the target–AS1–effector crystal structure). These changes to the fusion region, although distant from both binding sites, caused considerable variation in the kinetics of target dissociation and their modulation by the effector (Supplementary Fig. 11). Most of these variants showed reduced target off-rates (compared with AS1) in the absence of effector that increased in the presence of effector (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Table 1), and for the fastest variant (AS117), adding effector accelerated target dissociation by 2,400-fold, reaching a rate exceeding that of the original AS1 (Fig. 4b). By comparing the predicted deformations with the facilitated dissociation rates in the forward and reverse directions (Supplementary Note 4), we found that the global strain energy of the ternary complex depends on both the magnitude and the direction of the deformation (Supplementary Fig. 10) and that strain can distribute non-uniformly throughout the structure, leading to kinetic asymmetry24 (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Extended Data Fig. 4).

We next set out to use facilitated dissociation to construct protein systems with kinetic behaviours that were previously inaccessible to design. First, inspired by toehold-mediated strand displacement in DNA28, we sought to create a kinetically trapped system which, on stimulation, quickly reconfigures through a chain reaction. To investigate this, we fused the effector peptide (E2) for a second reporter hinge (H2) to the target such that E2 is occluded when this fusion (E2–target) is bound to a host (Extended Data Fig. 5). As intended, the release of E2–target from AS114 and the subsequent switching of H2 is slow, but accelerates markedly upon addition of the original effector, which accelerates E2–target dissociation (we include excess original target to prevent E2–target rebinding39; Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 5). In principle, multiple orthogonal hosts could be constructed and chained together through such target–effector fusions.

Second, we reasoned that our designs could complement split protein systems with high affinity and enable them to be switched off rapidly. To test this, we tagged AS1 and the target with NanoBiT split luciferase fragments, LgBiT and SmBiT (ref. 40). When combined, these components exhibit high luciferase activity that disappears much more rapidly upon addition of effector and excess untagged target than upon addition of excess untagged target alone (Fig. 4d).

Third, in previously designed thermodynamically controlled biosensors that operate through a conformational selection mechanism, there is a trade-off between dynamic range and response time (reducing background by lowering the energy of the ‘off' state generally slows interconversion with the ‘on' state)41,42. We reasoned that sensors based on facilitated dissociation could be limited by the rate of target association rather than by internal conformational switching, and found that by caging the SmBiT peptide within the effector bound to a host, facilitated dissociation (in the reverse direction compared with previously) upon binding the target uncaged the SmBiT rapidly to enable luciferase reconstitution (Methods). Using this strategy together with a designed SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) binder (LCB1; ref. 43), we generated 16 ‘AScov' sensor designs in which the RBD clashes with the switch in state Y but not in state X. After addition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, the best sensor shows a 30-fold increase in luciferase activity, with a half-time of 30 s (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 6)—70 times faster than a previously designed LOCKR-based SARS-CoV-2 sensor that relies on conformational selection41. Thus, using this platform, a binder to almost any target can be turned into a single-component sensor that is sufficiently fast that, in most practical applications, its response time will be limited by target association rather than by a slow conformational change.

Finally, we investigated whether facilitated dissociation could be used to control cellular processes with high temporal resolution. In cellular signalling, the residence times of ligands on their cognate receptors is thought to modulate the signalling and cellular responses44,45,46. The central immune cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) activates the IL-2 receptor (IL-2Rβγc) by inducing heterodimerization of chains β and γc (ref. 47). The resulting complexes dissociate or degrade on timescales of hours48,49, so controlling the temporal dynamics of IL-2 signalling is difficult: there is no off-switch (Fig. 5a).

We set out to construct a switchable IL-2 mimic that enables control over the lifetime of the IL-2Rβγc complex with a time resolution of seconds (Fig. 5b). Neo2, a previously designed IL-2 mimic, tightly binds to IL-2Rβγc to elicit downstream signalling50. Sampling a variety of γc positions relative to the switch from AS1, we rigidly fused Neo2 to the switch such that in state X, γc can bind, but in the effector-bound state Y, it would strongly clash (Fig. 5c). We identified several designs for which binding the effector markedly accelerates the dissociation of γc from the active signalling complex (Supplementary Fig. 13). For one of these, ASNeo2, binding the effector induces a 1,500-fold increase in the γc off-rate (Fig. 5d). We designed variants of ASNeo2 with different dissociation kinetics and topological safeguards against degradation (Supplementary Note 5); for one, the effector accelerated γc dissociation by 5,700-fold, the highest fold change of all our designed systems (Extended Data Fig. 8).

To investigate the switching capability of ASNeo2 in a physiological context, we quantified the dimerization of labelled IL-2Rβ and γc in the plasma membrane of live cells by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. Dual-colour co-tracking and mobility analyses confirmed that ASNeo2 efficiently dimerizes IL-2Rβ and γc and that adding the effector reverses this association rapidly and completely, even at a high excess of γc (Fig. 5e,f, Extended Data Fig. 7c–i and Supplementary Video 1). By double labelling ASNeo2 on opposite sides, we could observe the effector-induced intramolecular conformational change at the plasma membrane using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) (Extended Data Fig. 7j,k). ASNeo2 activates signalling in human natural killer (NK) cells (YT-1 cell line), and its activity is greatly reduced in the presence of the effector (Fig. 5g). After the effector is added, STAT5 phosphorylation immediately stops accumulating and gradually decreases to a low level (Fig. 5h). The effector blocks ASNeo2 activity nearly as effectively as does ruxolitinib, a JAK1 inhibitor.

To examine how the duration of IL-2 signalling affects the downstream cellular response, we stimulated primary human T cells with ASNeo2 and induced dissociation at various time points. Whereas sustained stimulation was required for proliferation51 (Fig. 5i), protection from apoptosis was evident after a short transient stimulation: cells treated with ASNeo2 and then with effector 5 min afterwards survived three days later at double the rate of an unstimulated control (Fig. 5j), despite the suppression of most downstream IL-2 target proteins (Extended Data Fig. 9e). This likely reflects reduced caspase-3 activity and increased BCL2 expression after transient stimulation (Fig. 5k and Extended Data Fig. 9g).

To further investigate the dependence of IL-2 signalling on the lifetime of the signalling complexes, we compared RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from T cells that were treated with ASNeo2 transiently, continuously or not at all (Fig. 5l–n and Supplementary Fig. 14). Transient stimulation (through incubation with ASNeo2 followed by effector-induced dissociation) upregulated genes that are involved in suppressing apoptosis (BCL2, NIBAN2 and RNF157), cell-cycle regulation (CDKN2B, CDK6, CCND2 and PIM1), suppressing cytokine signalling (SOCS2 and CISH) and immune activation (TNFSF8, HAVCR2 and PTGER2) (Fig. 5m). On activation, T cells typically shift their energy production from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis52, and we observed that transient stimulation downregulates oxidative-phosphorylation genes (Fig. 5n and Supplementary Fig. 15; glycolysis genes are not yet upregulated). Sustained stimulation activated genes associated with mTORC-driven metabolic changes and MYC- and E2F-driven cell-cycle progression (for example, CDK4 and POLD2), but transient stimulation did not (Fig. 5n, Extended Data Fig. 9i and Supplementary Fig. 15), suggesting that IL-2 signalling must be sustained to pass the G1/S checkpoint. Transient stimulation did activate genes associated with formation of the mitotic spindle (for example, DOCK2 and KIF1B) (Fig. 5n, Extended Data Fig. 9i and Supplementary Fig. 15), suggesting that preparations for mitosis are made immediately after T cell activation, before cell-cycle checkpoints. These results show how designed facilitated dissociation can be used to tackle unanswered questions in cell biology.

We show here that by explicitly considering excited intermediate states when designing coupled protein systems, a broad range of facilitated dissociation systems can be designed. We use a switchable target binder (host) and a flexible effector that can rapidly bind to and switch the target–host complex to induce a large steric clash with the target, forming a strained excited ternary complex. By modulating the strain energy of the ternary complex, we can tune the resulting acceleration of target dissociation. Crystal structures throughout the facilitated dissociation process confirm our ability to design excited states and large register-shift conformational changes. Our designed dynamic systems show both a high dynamic range and a rapid stimulus response, demonstrating the kinetic advantage of facilitated dissociation over mutually exclusive competition.

Power-stroke mechanisms8,31 can generate force more efficiently than can ratchet mechanisms (in which a single large step is rectified at the end of the conformational change)37. Induced folding underlies the kinesin power stroke53, and our flexible effector likely also folds upon binding, accelerating the conformational transition by lowering the energy barrier: the energetic costs of uphill steps along the transition coordinate can be compensated by the formation of additional interactions with the folding peptide35,36,54. In contrast to this induced-fit mechanism of the flexible effector, we find that a rigid effector provides reduced rate acceleration even though it binds more tightly38. In kinesin and other biological systems, it is difficult to directly assess the role of flexibility and folding upon binding in overall function; by contrast, our designed model systems allow the direct comparison of flexible and rigid effectors and show that the former yield faster conformational transitions against loads.

Most known examples of facilitated dissociation couple the target and the effector through a combination of direct steric overlap17,18,19,20,26,32 and intricate allostery14,15,22,23,24,25. By contrast, because our allosteric mechanism of switching steric clashes places no specific requirements on the binder or target, our approach can be used to dynamically regulate protein–protein interactions quite generally: by fusing to our switch, almost any binding interaction can be made to switch off rapidly in the presence of an effector. Our approach transferred immediately to rapidly switching active IL-2-like signalling complexes: we obtained several working designs on the first attempt (in which 24 designs were tested). Controlling the duration of IL-2 signalling with such switchable cytokines could enable investigation of early events in signalling or tuning of the cell response through timing-sensitive regulatory mechanisms further downstream51 (for example, disrupting signalling complexes at the cell surface or later in the endosome49 could be used to distinguish the cellular responses induced by signalling from each compartment55). Therapeutically, systemic administration of the effector and local administration of the switchable cytokine could elicit strong immune activation at only the site of administration (because any cytokine that escapes into circulation would be deactivated by the effector). More generally, our work provides a route to designing the rates and pathways of protein motion and change, which should ultimately enable the construction of complex, lifelike protein machinery.

In PyMOL, we manually positioned the switch relative to the binder–target complex subject to several constraints: there is no steric overlap between the target and switch state X; there is large steric overlap between the target and switch state Y; the smallest deformation that could be undergone by the switch and the target to resolve this clash is in the desired direction; and the switch C terminus and binder N terminus are relatively oriented such that sensible additional structure could be built between the switch and the binder to rigidly fuse them as positioned. To aid in visualizing this additional structure, we also included placeholder helices while manually positioning the switch and binder, effectively ‘sketching' the fusion (Supplementary Fig. 4b).

We then refined these sketches into plausible backbones. For the initial fusions including AS0, we extracted the centre four residues of the placeholder helix, then used inpainting with RosettaFold56 to scaffold that fragment between the switch and the binder. For later fusions, including the AS1 variants and ASNeo2 designs, we first used Rosetta FastDesign57 to sample around the starting sketch for designable positions of the switch, binder and placeholder helices while keeping the region of the state X switch that clashes in state Y fixed relative to the target, then used RFDiffusion7 (conditioned on the secondary structure and block adjacency of the sketches) to build structure between the sampled switch and binder positions. During both structure-generation approaches, we masked noncritical residues on the switch and binder interfacing with the fusion structure. After generation of the fusion backbone structure, we used ProteinMPNN58 to optimize sequences for the fusion structure and the masked residues on the switch and binder. To filter designs, we used AF259 (with initial guess (AF2-IG)60 for complex predictions) to predict the structure of the fusions alone, with the target, and with the effector, selecting designs for which each structural state is correctly and confidently predicted by a majority of the five model weight sets. Finally, for the AS1 variants and ASNeo2 designs, we used AF2-IG to predict the structure of the strained ternary complexes, selecting sets with a diversity of deformation directions.

Designs AS1, AS2, AS5 and AS7 were generated starting from design AS0, which contains the hinge switch cs221. When cs221 was designed, its state Y was generated by copying the N-terminal domain (helices 1–4) of its parent scaffold (DHR20; ref. 61), aligning helix 4 of the copy to the corresponding helix of DHR20 offset by three residues, and combining the transformed N-terminal domain and original C-terminal domain into a single protein33. Thus, relative to the C-terminal domain, the N-terminal domain is both rotated around and translated along the axis of helix 4, exposing a cleft between the domains for binding a helical peptide. Now, to generate a new state X for this switch that retains an open cleft, we repeated this procedure but aligned the N-terminal domain with a residue offset of −4 instead of 3, so that overall this position of the N-terminal domain is shifted from state Y along helix 4 by one heptad (Supplementary Fig. 4e). This introduces minimal rotation and thus maintains the open cleft. We combined this new position of the N-terminal domain with the entire C-terminal domain of AS0 (including the fusion to LHD101B), then used Rosetta FastDesign to further sample designable positions of the N-terminal domain around this starting point. In half of the design trajectories, we included a placeholder helix in the cleft to help ensure it remains open. We then used inpainting with RosettaFold to generate loops connecting the domains, then paired these complete state X backbones with the original effector-bound state Y of AS0 (also generating new loops between domains in state Y as necessary to match the loop lengths of each new state X).

To generate single sequences that support both states, we first performed multi-state design with Rosetta FastDesign (enforcing sequence symmetry between states) to further refine the paired backbones so that they are more mutually compatible, then used ProteinMPNN with residue probabilities tied at corresponding positions between states to optimize sequences simultaneously for both conformations33. During these sequence-design steps, the sequence of the effector and of the binder fusion was kept fixed. To filter designs, we used AF2-IG to predict the structure of the switches both with and without the effector, selecting designs for which the new state X (in the absence of effector) and state Y (in the presence of effector) are correctly and confidently predicted by a majority of the five model weight sets. To further ensure that these designs favour state X in the absence of effector and state Y in the presence of effector, we only selected designs that scored more favourably in Rosetta in state X than in state Y, but also scored more favourably in state Y with the effector bound than the sum of the scores of state X and the unbound effector.

We first sought to cage the SmBiT peptide within the effector so that, through reverse facilitated dissociation, binding of the target would rapidly uncage the SmBiT to enable luciferase reconstitution. We grafted SmBiT onto the effector peptide at a range of positions, then screened these ‘SmBiTgraft' variants for binding to AS0 and rapid dissociation after binding of the target. We used AS0 as the base design, reasoning that its closed state X would slow undesired peptide reassociation. For each working SmBiTgraft, we then generated a flexibly linked LgBiT–SmBiTgraft–AS0 construct. The best construct shows low luciferase activity that increases rapidly after addition of target, but only slowly after addition of effector peptide (which must compete directly with SmBiTgraft) (Extended Data Fig. 6). To demonstrate the modularity of this platform, using the methods described above for designing hosts, we rigidly fused a SARS-CoV-2 RBD binder (LCB1; ref. 43) to the switch in place of the target binder such that the RBD clashes with the switch in state Y but not in state X, and tested 16 of these AScov fusion designs.

Synthetic DNA fragments encoding each design were obtained from IDT as eBlocks and cloned into custom vectors using Golden Gate assembly62. Designs usually contained a C-terminal sequence-specific nickel-assisted cleavage (SNAC) tag63 and a 6×His tag (MSG-Protein-GSGSHHWGSTHHHHHH). Proteins to be captured on the chip for SPR experiments contained an N-terminal AviTag and a C-terminal 6×His tag (MSGLNDIFEAQKIEWHESSG-Protein-GSGHHHHHH). For the size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) binding experiments shown in Supplementary Fig. 6 and for screening SmBiTgraft effector peptide variants with SPR, the effector was fused to superfolder GFP in a sfGFP-GSSG-Effector-GSHHHHHH construct. To rapidly break split luciferases, AS1 was fused to LgBiT in a MSG-AS1-linker-LgBiT-GSHHHHHH construct and the target was fused to SmBiT in a MSG-Target-linker-SmBiT-GSHHHHHH construct. In the rapid sensors, AS0 and AScov were fused to LgBiT and a SmBiT-containing effector in a MSGHHHHHHGS-LgBiT-linker-SmBiTgraft-linker-(AS0 or AScov)-GS construct. Sequences for all designs are available in Supplementary Table 4.

All proteins were expressed from NEB BL21(DE3) E. coli cells using TBII (MpBio) autoinduction medium with 0.5% (w/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) glucose, 0.2% (w/v) lactose, 20 mM MgSO4, trace metal mix and 50 μg ml−1 kanamycin. Expression cultures (50 ml) were grown either at 37 °C for 16–20 h or at 37 °C for 6–8 h, then at 18 °C for 16–20 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 5 ml lysis buffer (100 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 Pierce Protease Inhibitor Mini Tablets, EDTA-free per 50 ml) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000g for 30 min. Protein in the soluble lysate was bound to 1 ml Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN), washed with 5 ml low-salt wash buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 50 mM imidazole), 5 ml high-salt wash buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl, 50 mM imidazole) and 5 ml low-salt wash buffer, and eluted in 1.2 ml elution buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 500 mM imidazole) after a 0.4 ml pre-elution. The proteins were further purified by SEC on a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system with a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl) with 1-ml fractions. Where possible, fractions that probably corresponded to protein monomers were selected. Final protein concentrations were estimated using molar extinction coefficients predicted from the protein sequence and integrating the absorbance at 280 nm over the selected fractions. Correct protein molecular weights were confirmed using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS).

The effector peptide cs221B was chemically synthesized by GenScript. The TAMRA-labelled effector used in fluorescence polarization (FP) experiments was synthesized as previously described33.

Individual host proteins, sfGFP–effector and 1:1 host:sfGFP–effector mixtures were prepared at 20 μM in TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl). A 0.5-ml quantity of each solution was injected onto a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column in TBS and the absorbance at 230 nm was monitored for changes in the retention volumes of the mixture compared with the individual proteins.

FP binding experiments with TAMRA-labelled effector were performed at 25 °C in TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl) with 0.05% v/v TWEEN20 in 96-well plates (Corning 3686). Parallel and perpendicular fluorescence intensity was measured using a Synergy Neo2 plate reader with an FP 530/590 filter cube. Fluorescence polarization P (in units of mP) was calculated by the following expression:

For affinity measurements, host proteins were titrated by twofold serial dilution across TAMRA–effector (at a constant concentration between 0.1 and 1 nM) through 24 wells, with a final volume of 80 μl in each well. Plates were incubated for at least 12 h at room temperature to fully equilibrate before measurement. To determine affinities, the following binding isotherm function was fitted to the measured polarization values using nonlinear least-squares minimization:

where P is the modelled polarization, P0 is the polarization of free effector, P1 is the change in polarization after binding the host, fbound is the fraction of effector bound to the host, [H] and [E] are the total concentrations of host and effector, respectively, and Kd is the affinity between the host and the effector. When the fit Kd is lower than [E], affinities are too strong to be accurately measured with this method, so ‘Kd < [E]' is reported.

For kinetic competition measurements, the target LHD101An1 was titrated by twofold serial dilution across the host protein (at a constant concentration of 22 nM) through five wells (a sixth well with just the host was also included) with a final volume of 72 μl in each well. Plates were incubated for one hour to allow the host and the target to equilibrate. To each well, 8 μl of 200 nM TAMRA–effector was added and rapidly mixed using a multichannel pipette, and the measurement was started immediately afterwards. This resulted in a 20 nM final concentration of both host and effector in a final volume of 80 μl per well. The following single exponential decay function was fitted to the measured polarization time courses using nonlinear least-squares minimization:

where P is the modelled polarization, P0 is the polarization of free effector, P1 is the amplitude of the change in polarization, kapp is the apparent rate constant and t is the time after the start of the measurement.

To measure facilitated dissociation in the reverse direction, host and TAMRA–effector were incubated at a 2:1 ratio to fully saturate the effector with host, diluted to 4 nM host and 2 nM effector, and distributed across 11 wells (40 μl in each well). In nine separate wells, the target was titrated by a fourfold serial dilution with constant excess unlabelled effector (40 μM). Just excess unlabelled effector at 40 μM was prepared in the 10th separate well (to measure the base rate of effector dissociation), and buffer was prepared in the 11th (to confirm the baseline remains stable). Forty microlitres of these target + effector solutions were added to the 11 host + TAMRA–effector wells and rapidly mixed using a multichannel pipette, and the measurement was started immediately afterwards. This resulted in final concentrations of 2 nM host, 1 nM TAMRA–effector, 20 μM unlabelled effector (to make the dissociation of TAMRA–effector irreversible) and varying concentrations of target in a final volume of 80 μl per well. The following single exponential decay function was fitted to the measured polarization time courses using nonlinear least-squares minimization:

The following hyperbolic function was fitted to the apparent rate constants kapp:

where koff,H:E is the base effector off-rate constant, koff,TH:E is the off-rate constant for accelerated effector dissociation from the ternary complex, K1/2 is the concentration at which half the rate increase from koff,H:E to koff,TH:E is reached and [T] is the concentration of target present.

Proteins to be captured on the SPR chip were expressed with an N-terminal AviTag and purified as described above, except that the proteins were biotinylated after elution from the Ni-NTA resin: to the elutions, 5 μg ml−1 BirA (Avidity), 10 mM ATP, 10 mM Mg(OAc)2 and 100 μM d-biotin were added and allowed to incubate at room temperature for at least 4 h before further purification by SEC. Successful biotinylation was confirmed using LC–MS. SPR measurements were performed at 25 °C in HBS-EP+ buffer (Cytiva) on a Biacore 8K instrument. Biotinylated proteins were immobilized on the chip using the Biotin CAPture system (Cytiva).

For measurements of target off-rate constants, biotinylated target protein was immobilized on the chip. To measure base off-rate constants koff,T:H, host proteins at 50 nM were flowed over the chip for 60 s, then dissociation was measured for 2 h. To measure accelerated off-rate constants koff,T:HE, pre-incubated host–effector complexes (host at 1 μM and effector at 5 μM to ensure that the host is saturated with effector) were flowed for 60 s to form the ternary complex on the chip, then dissociation was measured for 4–20 min under a constant flow of 5 μM effector. Most dissociation data were fitted with the following double exponential decay function to account for populations of host protein with different dissociation kinetics:

where S is the modelled SPR response, S0 is the baseline, S1 and S2 are amplitudes relating to the sizes of each host population, kapp,1 and kapp,2 are apparent rate constants corresponding to each host population, t is the time and t0 is the time at which dissociation initiates. The reported rate constant typically corresponds to the faster and higher amplitude exponential in the fit; instances in which other criteria are used to determine which rate constant corresponds to the change of interest are noted. When clearly only one host population is present (often indicated by kapp,1 ≈ kapp,2 or a large difference between S1 and S2 when fitting a double exponential), the following single exponential decay function was fitted instead, in which the parameters are the same as above (instances in which single exponentials were used are noted):

To measure the rate constant of effector association to form the ternary complex, biotinylated host protein was immobilized on the chip. The host protein was saturated with target by flowing 5 μM target over the chip for 4 min, then a varying concentration of effector and 5 μM target was flowed over the chip for 2–4 min to associate the effector, and finally 5 μM target was flowed over the chip for 4 min to monitor effector dissociation. Target was included at 5 μM (higher than its affinity to the ternary complex) throughout the experiment to ensure that the host remained saturated with target, preventing changes in target binding from convoluting the response from effector binding. Association data were fitted with the following single exponential decay function:

where S is the modelled SPR response, S0 is the baseline, S1 is the amplitude, kapp is the apparent rate constant, t is the time and t0 is the time at which dissociation initiates.

With the peptide effector, the following linear function was fitted to the apparent rate constants:

where kon,TH:E and koff,TH:E are on-rate and off-rate constants and [E] is the concentration of effector flowed over the chip.

With the 3hb effector, the following hyperbolic function was fitted to the apparent rate constants:

where kswitch is the rate constant for the THX → THY conformational change, kunswitch is the rate constant for the THY → THX conformational change, kon,TH:E and koff,TH:E are on-rate and off-rate constants and [E] is the concentration of effector flowed over the chip. This function describes the slow relaxation rate constant of binding by conformational selection64. The data can be fitted with only the slow relaxation because, as the conformational pre-equilibrium favours state X (that is, kswitch « kunswitch), the effect of the fast relaxation on kapp is minimal. During the fit, koff,TH:E was constrained to a low value (<1 × 10−4 s−1), as observed.

To measure the effector-concentration-dependent rate constant of the full facilitated dissociation process, either biotinylated target protein or biotinylated common gamma γc ectodomain (Acro Biosystems ILG-H85E8) was immobilized on the chip. For experiments with ASNeo2 designs, the ASNeo2 hosts were pre-incubated with IL-2Rβ ectodomain (Acro Biosystems CD2-H5221) before association with γc. Each experiment involved multiple cycles of host association and induced dissociation under the flow of various concentrations of effector obtained by twofold serial dilution (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Throughout these cycles, a small population of host that is unresponsive to the effector (‘Hn', owing to partial degradation or misfolding induced by the strain in the ternary complex) could accumulate on the chip (Supplementary Fig. 8a,b). The following system of differential equations describing the expected behaviour of the proteins on the chip (accounting for this accumulation) can be fitted to the dissociation curve of cycle n (Supplementary Fig. 8c):

with initial values computed for each cycle by

and the modelled concentrations of each complex state on the chip is related to the SPR response by

where S is the modelled SPR response, [THE], [TH] and [THn] are concentrations of complex states on the chip, t is the time after the start of the dissociation cycle, [E] is the concentration of effector flowed over the chip, koff,T:H, koff,T:HE, kon,TH:E, koff,TH:E and koff,T:Hn are on-rate and off-rate constants, aTH, aTHE and aTHn are amplitudes relating the concentration of each state on the chip to an SPR response, fn is an amplitude fudge factor for cycle n accounting for small differences in amplitude across cycles and fresponsive is the fraction of host that is responsive to the effector. Varying all of these parameters, this model is then globally fitted to the dissociation curves of all cycles using nonlinear least-squares minimization. Note that with a sufficiently high value of kon,TH:E, this model's dissociation kinetics are determined mainly by the target dissociation parameters koff,T:H and koff,T:HE; meanwhile, the effector binding parameters kon,TH:E and koff,TH:E tend to tightly covary and cannot be accurately determined from these fits. Also note that for designs with low values for koff,T:HE, this model may be less accurate because the assumption that [THE] = 0 at the beginning of each cycle may no longer be valid. To compute the effective rate constant of the full facilitated dissociation process for intact host, we used the following simplified system of differential equations, which no longer accounts for a small population of unresponsive host:

For each effector concentration [E], this system was solved for the half-time of the target:host interaction t1/2 using the rate parameters determined from the original model fitted to the data, and the effective rate constant of the full dissociation process keff was computed from each half-time as follows:

The following hyperbolic function was fitted to the effective rate constants (constrained to the values of koff,T:HE and koff,T:H obtained from the global fit):

where koff,T:H is the base target off-rate constant, koff,T:HE is the off-rate constant for accelerated target dissociation from the ternary complex, K1/2 is the concentration at which half the rate increase from koff,T:H to koff,T:HE is reached and [E] is the concentration of effector flowed over the chip.

The discrepancy in the 3hb EC50 between the 3hb association experiment in Fig. 2f (right) and the target facilitated dissociation experiment in Fig. 2h (right) could result from the fusion tag that was used to fix AS1 to the surface competing with the 3hb for binding the cleft, reducing the apparent 3hb on-rate in the 3hb association experiment but not in the target facilitated dissociation experiment.

All SPR measurements in the main figures were repeated at least once, with similar results.

Circular dichroism spectra were measured at 25 °C on protein samples at 0.2 mg ml−1 in TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl) using a Jasco J-1500 spectrophotometer.

The AS1 TH and THE complexes required increased hydrophobicity to crystallize. This was accomplished by lysine methylation (for crystals AS1_TH 1, AS1_TH 2 and AS1_THE 1) or with the hydrophobic surface mutations K46L, E50W, K172W and E173Y (for crystal AS1_THE 2).

Protein was expressed from NEB BL21(DE3) E. coli cells using TBII autoinduction medium as above but at a larger scale: either 8 × 50 ml or 1–2 × 500 ml cultures. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer and lysed by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000g for 30 min. Protein in the soluble lysate was bound to 8 ml Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN), washed with 10 ml low-salt wash buffer, 30 ml high-salt wash buffer and 10 ml SNAC cleavage buffer (100 mM 2-(N-cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid (CHES), 100 mM acetone oxime, 100 mM NaCl and 500 mM guanidinium chloride, pH 8.6)63 and incubated in 40 ml SNAC cleavage buffer + 2 nM NiCl2 for 12 h at room temperature to cleave. Afterwards, the flowthrough was collected and the beads were washed with 40 ml lysis buffer (minus the protease inhibitors). The amount of cleaved protein in the flowthrough and wash was assessed with SDS–PAGE, and fractions with enough cleaved protein were concentrated and further purified using SEC on an FPLC system with either a Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 GL column or a HiLoad 20/600 Superdex 75 pg column in either TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl) or lysine methylation buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 250 mM NaCl) if lysine residues in the protein were to be methylated. For protein complex cocrystallization, the purified proteins and/or chemically synthesized effector were mixed at equimolar ratios. For some samples (resulting in crystals AS1_TH 1, AS1_TH 2 and AS1_THE 1), lysine residues were methylated as previously described65, and the reaction was quenched using SEC on an FPLC system to buffer-exchange into TBS. Finally, the samples were concentrated to crystallization levels.

Crystallization experiments were done using the sitting drop vapour diffusion method. Initial crystallization trials were set up in 200-nl drops using the 96-well plate format at 20 °C. Crystallization plates were set up using a Mosquito LCP from SPT Labtech, then imaged using UVEX microscopes and UVEX PS-256 from JAN Scientific. Diffraction-quality crystals formed in 0.2 M magnesium chloride hexahydrate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate pH 6.5 and 50% v/v PEG 200 for AS1_H; in 0.2 M sodium chloride, 0.1 M Na/K phosphate pH 6.2 and 50% v/v PEG 200 for CS221B; in 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.0, 5% w/v γ-PGA (Na+ form, LM) and 30% v/v PEG 400 for LHD101An1; in 0.2 M magnesium chloride hexahydrate, 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5 and 25% w/v polyethylene glycol 3,350 for AS5_HE; in 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.0 and 20% (v/v) MPD for AS5_H; in 0.2 M 1,6-hexanediol, 0.2 M 1-butanol, 0.2 M 1,2-propanediol, 0.2 M 2-propanol, 0.2 M 1,4-butanediol, 0.2 M 1,3-propanediol, sodium HEPES, MOPS (acid) pH 7.5, 40% v/v PEG 500 MME and 20% w/v PEG 20000 for AS1_HE; in 0.1 M citric acid pH 3.5 and 2.0 M ammonium sulfate for AS1_THE 1; in 1.0 M lithium chloride, 0.1 M citrate pH 4.0 and 20% w/v PEG 6000 for AS1_THE 2; in 2.4 M sodium malonate pH 7.0 for AS1_TH 1 (P 61 2 2); and in 1.8 M ammonium citrate tribasic pH 7.0 for AS1_TH 2 (P 21 21 21).

Diffraction data were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source II beamline 17-ID-1 (FMX/AMX), the Advanced Light Source beamline 821/822 or the Advanced Photon Source NECAT 24ID-C. X-ray intensities and data reduction were evaluated and integrated using XDS66 and merged and scaled using Pointless or Aimless in the CCP4 program suite67. Structure determination and refinement starting phases were obtained by molecular replacement with Phaser68, using the designed model for the structures. After molecular replacement, the models were improved using phenix.autobuild with rebuild-in-place to false and using simulated annealing. Structures were refined in PHENIX69. Model building was performed using Coot70. The final model was evaluated using MolProbity71. Data collection and refinement statistics are provided in Extended Data Tables 1–3.

Spin-label modelling and distance distribution predictions were performed as previously described33 using chiLife72 with the off-rotamer sampling method73. Site pair selections were performed as previously described33. Host protein variants containing cysteine residues at the selected sites were purified as described above, except that 0.5 mM TCEP was included in the lysis buffer and the first two Ni-NTA resin washes, and the proteins were labelled immediately after elution from the Ni-NTA resin: to the elutions, 50 μl of 200 mM of the nitroxide spin label 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSL) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added and allowed to incubate for at least 2 h at room temperature before further purification by SEC. Successful labelling was confirmed using LC–MS. DEER samples were prepared at 20 µM labelled host protein in deuterated solvent buffered by 20 mM Tris at pH 8.0 with 100 mM NaCl and 20% d8-glycerol (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as a glassing agent. When appropriate, target and effector were added to a concentration of 100 µM each. Then, 15–30 µl of each sample was loaded into a quartz capillary (Sutter Instrument, 1.1 mm inner diameter, 1.5 mm outer diameter) and flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at −80 °C until the DEER experiments were performed.

DEER experiments were performed as previously described33. An ELEXSYS E580 spectrometer (Bruker) at Q-band (around 34 GHz) with an EN5107D2 resonator (Bruker) was used for all experiments. The temperature was maintained at 50 K using a cryogen-free cooling system (ColdEdge). The four-pulse DEER sequence was used, using 60-ns Gaussian observer pulses with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 30 ns and a frequency near the centre of the field-swept spectrum and 150-ns sech/tanh probe pulses with centre 80 MHz above the observer frequency, 80 MHz bandwidth and a truncation parameter of 10. All shaped pulses were generated using the SpinJet arbitrary waveform generator (Bruker). Pulse shapes were calculated using PulseShape (https://github.com/stolllab/PulseShape), using both resonator compensation and transmitter nonlinearity compensation. All data were collected using a 2 ms shot repetition time, 8-step phase cycling and τ1 averaging from 400 ns to 528 ns in 16-ns steps. All other experimental parameters (including pump pulse time step, τ2 delays, number of scans and others) were chosen on a per-sample basis and are reported in Supplementary Table 3.

All DEER data were analysed using the DeerExp module of the eprTools Python package (https://github.com/mtessmer/eprTools). All data were fitted using separable nonlinear least squares74. The foreground signal was modelled using Tikhonov regularization with the second derivative operator. The regularization parameter was selected using generalized cross-validation. The background was modelled using a 3D-homogeneous spin distribution. An additional penalty restraining the modulation depth to be low was used to prevent the fitting of long-distance artefacts in the foreground, as was done previously75. Confidence intervals were estimated using bootstrap sampling with 100 samples using a fixed regularization parameter. Fit parameters such as the regularization parameter, the modulation depth and the signal-to-noise ratio are listed in Supplementary Table 3.

Input files for the MD simulation were prepared with CHARMM-GUI76,77, with AF2 structure as the initial structure. A rectangular water box of edge length 10 Å was placed around the protein. The water box contained potassium and chlorine ions of concentration 0.15 M that neutralized the protein's net charge. The ions were placed in the water box using the Monte Carlo method. To model the system, the CHARMM36m force field78 was used. After the explicit solvent system was made, the system was minimized and equilibrated before the production MD run. All three steps were performed with the GROMACS 2020.2 MD engine79,80.

The steepest descent method was used for energy minimization, for 5,000 steps with an energy tolerance of 1000 kJ mol−1 nm−1. The neighbour list was updated every ten steps with a cut-off distance of 1.2 nm. Cut-off was used to calculate Van der Waals interactions with a switch distance of 1.0 nm and a cut-off distance of 1.2 nm. The force was smoothly switched off between the switch distance and the cut-off distance. The fast smooth particle-mesh Ewald method was used to calculate electrostatics with a cut-off distance of 1.0 nm. All bonds with hydrogen atoms were treated as rigid using the linear constraint solver (LINCS) algorithm81.

The equilibration step was performed with a leap-frog algorithm using a time step of 1 fs and a total simulation time of 125 ps. The system was propagated in the NVT ensemble. The temperature was maintained at 303.15 K using the velocity rescaling method. The solute and solvent were coupled with a time constant for coupling of 1 ps. The centre-of-mass translational velocity was removed every 100 steps to prevent the system from drifting. The cut-off schemes for Van der Waals and electrostatic interactions were the same as those used in the minimization step, except that the neighbour list was updated every 20 steps. The velocities were generated from a Maxwell distribution with a temperature of 303.15 K. The same LINCS method was used to constrain the hydrogen atoms during the equilibration step.

The production step was performed with a leap-frog algorithm using a time step of 2 fs and a total simulation time of 1 μs. The trajectories with the same initial equilibrated structure were obtained in triplicate. The system was propagated in the NPT ensemble. The temperature was maintained at 303.15 K using the velocity rescaling method. The solute and solvent were coupled with a time constant of 1 ps. Exponential relaxation pressure coupling and isotropic coupling with a time constant of 5.0 ps was used to maintain the pressure at 1.0 bar. The cut-off schemes for Van der Waals and electrostatic interactions were the same as those used in the minimization step, except that the neighbour list was updated every 20 steps and the Coulomb cut-off distance was set as 1.2 nm. The centre-of-mass velocity removal was the same as that used in the equilibration step. The same LINCS method was used to constrain the hydrogen atoms during the production step.

Analysis of the trajectories, such as RMSD and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) calculations, was performed with MDAnalysis82. To simulate DEER distance distributions from these trajectories, structures along each trajectory were clustered using the Gromos clustering algorithm83 in GROMACS, distance distributions were predicted (using chiLife72 with the off-rotamer sampling method73) for the centre structure of each cluster and the resulting distributions were averaged weighted by the occupancies of their corresponding clusters.

Hinge protein cs201F_E249L (H2) was purified as described above, except that 0.5 mM TCEP was included in the lysis, wash and elution buffers, and the SEC buffer was phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl and 0.5 mM TCEP). To double label with dyes, 50 μM H2 was incubated with 250 μM Alexa Fluor 555 C2 maleimide (donor; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 250 μM Alexa Fluor 647 C2 maleimide (acceptor; Thermo Fisher Scientific), shaking at room temperature for at least 2 h. The reaction was quenched by adding DTT to 10 mM, and the proteins were separated from excess dye by SEC in TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl).

FRET binding experiments were performed at 25 °C in TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl) with 0.05% v/v TWEEN20 in 96-well plates (Corning 3686). Fluorescence intensity was measured using a Synergy Neo2 plate reader, exciting the donor at a 520-nm wavelength and reading acceptor emission at a 665-nm wavelength.

To measure the E2–target on-rate constant, 40 μl H2 at 10 nM was prepared in six wells. To each well, 40 μl E2–target at various concentrations was added and rapidly mixed using a multichannel pipette, and the measurement was started immediately afterwards. The following single exponential decay function was fitted to the measured FRET time courses using nonlinear least-squares minimization,

where S is the modelled fluorescence signal, S0 is the fluorescence at equilibrium, S1 is the amplitude of the change in fluorescence, kapp is the apparent rate constant and t is the time after the start of the measurement. The following linear function was fitted to the apparent rate constants:

where kon and koff are on-rate and off-rate constants and [E2] is the total concentration of E2–target.

To measure the accelerated transfer of E2 from AS114 to H2, 1,067 nM AS114 and 533 nM E2–target were incubated for 15 min to fully cage E2–target in AS114. A control solution of just 1,067 nM AS114 was also prepared. A 37.5-μl quantity of 42.7 nM H2 was prepared in eight wells; 37.5 μl of AS114 + E2–target was added to four wells and 37.5 μl of AS114 was added to the other four wells using a multichannel pipette, and the measurement was started immediately afterwards. Five minutes later, four solutions (5 μl buffer, 100 μM target, 16 μM effector or 100 μM target + 16 μM effector) were added to each set of four wells (each solution to a different well of each set) using a multichannel pipette, and the measurement was immediately continued for 1 h. Mixing components at these concentrations resulted in final concentrations of 500 nM AS114, 250 nM E2–target, 20 nM H2, 1 μM effector and 6 μM target. A baseline drift function of the following form was fitted to the AS114 + buffer data and subtracted from the other time courses:

where S is the modelled fluorescence signal, S0 is the fluorescence at equilibrium, S1 is the amplitude of the change in fluorescence, k is a rate constant, t is the time after the start of the measurement and t1/2 is the time at which the fluorescence has changed by half the full amplitude. AS114 was used because, in state X, it does not clash with E2 extending past the target in E2–target.

Luminescence experiments were performed at 25 °C in TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl) with 0.05% v/v TWEEN20 in 96-well plates (Corning 3686). Luminescence was measured using a Synergy Neo2 plate reader with a LUM filter cube.

To measure rapid breakage of a split luciferase, 111 pM AS1–LgBiT and 22 nM target SmBiT were incubated for one hour to load AS1 with the target and reconstitute the split luciferase. Next, 72 μl of this mixture was added to two wells, then 8 μl of 1/10-diluted Nano-Glo substrate (Promega N1130) and either 10 μM effector and 200 μM target or just 200 μM target was added to these wells using a multichannel pipette, and the measurement was started immediately afterwards. Excess target was included to fully outcompete target–SmBiT to enable measurement of the dissociation rate. Mixing components at these concentrations resulted in final concentrations of 100 pM AS1–LgBiT, 20 nM target–SmBiT, 1 μM effector, 20 μM target and 1/100-diluted Nano-Glo substrate.

To measure rapid analyte sensing, 64 μl of 12.5-pM sensor was added to eight wells, 8 μl of 1/10-diluted Nano-Glo substrate was added to these wells using a multichannel pipette and the measurement was started immediately afterwards. Five minutes later, 8 μl of various concentrations of analyte obtained by tenfold serial dilution was added using a multichannel pipette, and the measurement was immediately continued for 30–60 min. Mixing components at these concentrations resulted in final concentrations of 10 pM sensor and 1/100-diluted Nano-Glo substrate. The analytes were target, effector or SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Acro Biosystems SPD-C52H3). Figure 4e shows a time course with 800 nM SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

For cell-surface labelling, receptors were N-terminally fused to suitable tags using a pSems vector including the signal sequence of Igκ (pSems leader). Common gamma chain (γc) was fused to the ALFA-tag84 and IL-2Rβ was fused to nonfluorescent monomeric GFP (mXFP)85. HeLa cells (ACC 57, DSMZ) were cultured as previously described86. For transient transfection, cells were incubated for 4–6 h with a mixture of 150 mM NaCl, 10 µl of 1 mg ml−1 polyethylenimine (PEI MAX, Polysciences 24765), 200 ng of DNA of pSems leader ALFA-tag-γc and 2,800 ng of pSems leader mXFPe1-IL-2Rβ87. Labelling, washing and subsequent imaging were performed after mounting the coverslips into custom-made incubation chambers with a volume of 1 ml. Cells were equilibrated in medium with fetal bovine serum (FBS) but lacking phenol red, supplemented with an oxygen scavenger and a redox-active photoprotectant (0.5 mg ml−1 glucose oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.04 mg ml−1 catalase (Roche), 5% w/v glucose, 1 μM ascorbic acid and 1 μM methylviologene) to minimize photobleaching88.

Selective cell-surface receptor labelling was achieved by using anti-GFP and anti-ALFA-tag nanobodies (NBs), which were site-specifically labelled by maleimide chemistry via a single cysteine residue at their C termini88. Anti-ALFA NB labelled with Cy3B (degree of labelling (DOL): 1.06) and anti-GFP NB labelled with ATTO 643 (DOL: 1.0) were added at concentrations of 3 nM each, at least 10 min before imaging. Coverslips were precoated with poly-l-lysine-graft-poly(ethylene glycol) to minimize unspecific binding of NBs and were functionalized with RGD peptide for efficient cell adhesion89.

During the imaging experiments, ASNeo2 was used at 100 nM, and 10 μM effector was used to induce receptor dissociation.

Dual-colour imaging was performed by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy using an inverted microscope (IX83, Olympus) equipped with a spectral image splitter (QuadView, Photometrics) and an EMCCD camera (iXon Ultra, Andor) as described in detail elsewhere90. Fluorophores were excited by sequential illumination with a 561-nm laser (2RU-VFL-P-2000-560-B1R, 2,000 mW, MPB Communications) and a 642-nm laser (2RU-VFL-P-2000-642-B1R, 2,000 mW, MPB Communications). Alternating laser excitation was achieved with a simple micro-controller (Arduino Uno) and open-source acquisition software91 synchronizing laser shuttering with an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF; AA.AOTFnC-400.650-TN, AA Opto Electronic) and camera triggering. For long-term tracking experiments, 1,500 frames per channel were acquired at 40 fps. The resulting image stacks were divided into five-frame stacks and dimerization was determined for each stack. For Fig. 5f, three time courses, each normalized to its average initial relative dimerization, are overlaid for each condition. For all other tracking experiments, 200 frames per channel were acquired at 40 fps and dimerization was determined over the whole image stack.

Dual-colour single-molecule co-tracking time-lapse images were evaluated using an in-house-developed MATLAB software (SLIMfast4C, https://zenodo.org/record/5712332)88. After channel registration based on calibration with fiducial markers, molecules were localized using the multi-target tracking algorithm92. Immobile emitters were filtered out by spatio-temporal cluster analysis93. Frame-by-frame co-localization within a cut-off radius of 150 nm was applied followed by tracking of co-localized emitters using the utrack algorithm94. Molecules co-diffusing for ten frames or more were then identified as co-localized. Relative levels of co-localization were determined on the basis of the fraction of co-localized particles relative to all localizations in the ALFA-γc channel (561 nm). Diffusion properties were determined from the pooled single trajectory using mean squared displacement analysis for all trajectories with a lifetime greater than ten frames. Diffusion constants were determined from the mean squared displacement by linear regression. Relative dimerization was estimated by:

FRET efficiencies were evaluated using an in-house-developed MATLAB software (provided and described in detail elsewhere as supplementary software90). In brief, alternating laser excitation FRET experiments provide three separated emission channels: directly excited donor \({D}_{{D}_{{\rm{ex}}}}^{{D}_{{\rm{em}}}}\) and acceptor \({A}_{{A}_{{\rm{ex}}}}^{{A}_{{\rm{em}}}}\) channels, as well as a sensitized FRET \({F}_{{D}_{{\rm{ex}}}}^{{A}_{{\rm{em}}}}\) channel. First, channels were aligned by calibration with fiducial markers. Then, after applying a single-molecule localization algorithm95, single-molecule intensities were determined from background subtracted images (\({I}_{{D}_{{\rm{ex}}}}^{{D}_{{\rm{em}}}}\), \({I}_{{A}_{{\rm{ex}}}}^{{A}_{{\rm{em}}}}\), \({I}_{{D}_{{\rm{ex}}}}^{{A}_{{\rm{em}}}}\)). To evaluate FRET efficiencies, donor–acceptor pairs were co-localized with an optimized search radius. For these pairs, the apparent FRET efficiency was calculated by:

To achieve accurate FRET efficiencies, standard further corrections were applied. These include the donor leakage coefficient, cross-talk-corrected proximity ratio and the correction factor γ (refs. 90,96).

Human NK (YT-1) cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 complete medium, supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, minimum essential non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES and penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco). For the flow-cytometry-based pSTAT5 detection assay, 2–5 × 105 IL-2Rα-positive YT-1 cells were seeded in 350 µl of medium per well in a 96-well plate. The cells were stimulated with 1 nM ASNeo2 or Neo2 for 5 min at 37 °C. As a control, 50 µl of untreated YT-1 cells were set aside at the start of each experiment and evaluated after 45 min alongside the treated cells. After stimulation, all cells were transferred to three separate wells containing a control (no treatment), 10 μM effector or 40 μM ruxolitinib. One-seventh of the cells (50 µl) were resuspended in 17 µl of 16% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for immediate fixation. This process was repeated at 5-, 10-, 15-, 30- and 45-min intervals. After all of the time points were fixed, the cells were refixed in 4% PFA for 15 min at room temperature. After fixation, the cells were washed once with PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (PBSA) and permeabilized with 100% methanol for 45 min at 4 °C. After permeabilization, the cells were washed twice with PBSA and stained for one hour at room temperature using Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated phospho-STAT5 (Tyr694) rabbit monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 9365, clone C71E5) diluted 1:100. After three washing steps, the cells were analysed using a CytoFlex S flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Data were analysed with CytExpert software, and cells were gated on SSC-A versus FSC-A. Each experiment was done in triplicate, and the results were analysed accordingly.

For Fig. 5g, pSTAT5 signal is normalized to the background level. For Fig. 5h, n = 3 time courses were normalized to the signal at time 0 (just before effector addition) and a baseline signal was determined by the average of this normalized pSTAT5 of the untreated cells, then each time course was renormalized to this baseline signal. Some batches of cells were unresponsive to stimulation; data from these batches were excluded from analysis.

HeLa cells for single-molecule imaging were sourced from the DSMZ (ACC 57); YT-1 (CD25+) cells were sourced from ATCC. Cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling. HeLa cells tested negative for mycoplasma contamination by PCR.

Primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from a healthy donor by leukapheresis were thawed and resuspended at a cell density of 2 × 106 cells per ml in T cell medium, which contained RPMI 1640 (Gibco), FBS (10% v/v, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), HEPES (25 mM, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), penicillin–streptomycin (1% v/v, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), sodium pyruvate (1% v/v, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), MEM non-essential amino acids solution (1% v/v, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 2-mercaptoethanol (0.1% v/v, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and supplemented with human IL-2 (100 U ml−1). For human T cell activation, cells were activated with plate-bound anti-human CD3ε (1 μg ml−1, clone OKT-3, BioXCell) and soluble anti-human CD28 (5 μg ml−1, clone 9.3, BioXCell) for 48 h. Cells were then expanded in T cell medium with human IL-2 (100 U ml−1) for eight days. On day 9, IL-2 was withdrawn for 36 h, after which cells were resuspended at 1 × 106 cells per ml and stimulated with ASNeo2 (1 nM or 5 nM) for either 5 or 25 min, as indicated. Effector peptide (10 μM) was then added to terminate signalling. After 48 or 72 h, cells were collected for counting and phenotypic analysis by flow cytometry.

For Fig. 5i,j, cells were stimulated with 1 nM ASNeo2. For Fig. 5k–n, cells were stimulated with 5 nM ASNeo2.

For surface-marker staining, cells were collected into U-bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific), blocked with Human TruStain FcX (BioLegend) and incubated with the indicated antibodies at 4 °C for 20 min, followed by live–dead staining by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were then washed and resuspended with FACS buffer (PBS containing 0.2 % BSA; Sigma-Aldrich) for flow-cytometry analyses. For phospho-STAT staining, primary human T cells were rested in T cell medium lacking IL-2 for 24 h before signalling assays. Cells were plated in a 96-well round-bottom plate in 50 μl T cell medium. Cells were stimulated with 50 µl ASNeo2 for 5 min or 25 min, followed by the addition of effector peptide and incubation for another 20 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated by fixation with 1.5% PFA for 15 min at room temperature with agitation. Cells were washed and permeabilized with ice-cold 100% methanol for 60 min on ice. Afterward, cells were washed with FACS buffer before staining with pSTAT5 antibodies for one hour at 4 °C in the dark. Cells were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer for flow-cytometry analyses. For caspase-3 staining, cells were first stained for surface markers and Zombie Violet Fixable Dye (BioLegend), followed by staining with a FITC Active Caspase-3 Apoptosis Kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For transcription factor staining, cells were first stained for surface markers and Zombie Violet Fixable Dye, then fixed and permeabilized using a Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were subsequently incubated with the indicated antibodies for intracellular staining. Detection was performed using a CytoFlex (Beckman Coulter), and data were analysed with FlowJo (v.10.10.0).

The following antibodies or staining reagents were purchased from BioLegend: human CD3 (OKT3, 317324), human GATA3 (W19195B, 386906), human CD69 (FN50, 310932), human CD25 (BC96, 302611), human BCL2 (100, 658708), human Ki-67 (Ki-67, 350526), Human TruStain FcX (422302) and Zombie Violet Fixable Viability Kit (423114). The following antibodies or staining reagents were purchased from BD Biosciences: pSTAT5 (47/Stat5, 612599), and BD Pharmingen FITC Active Caspase-3 Apoptosis Kit (571606). DAPI was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific.

Antibodies were diluted 1:200 for surface markers (CD3, CD28, CD69 and CD25), 1:100 for intracellular proteins (GATA3, Ki-67 and BCL2) and 1:50 for pSTAT and caspase-3 staining.

Antibodies were validated by the manufacturers using flow cytometry.

Human T cells on day 9 after activation were subjected to IL-2 starvation for 36 h. The unstimulated control cells were maintained in culture without IL-2. For transient IL-2 signalling, cells were stimulated with ASNeo2 (5 nM) for 25 min, followed by the addition of effector peptide (10 μM) to terminate signalling. For sustained signalling, ASNeo2 (5 nM) was continuously maintained in the culture medium. Total RNA was extracted using the Quick-RNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with random primers. qPCR was performed using TaqMan master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System. BCL2 expression was measured using the TaqMan BCL2 assay, and gene expression was normalized to GAPDH (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Relative expression levels were calculated using the ΔΔCt method.

Human T cells on day 8 after activation were subjected to IL-2 starvation for 36 h. The unstimulated control cells were maintained in culture without IL-2. For transient IL-2 signalling, cells were stimulated with ASNeo2 (5 nM) for 25 min, followed by the addition of effector peptide (10 μM) to terminate signalling. For sustained signalling, ASNeo2 (5 nM) was continuously maintained in the culture medium. After six hours, cells were collected, and total RNA was extracted using the Quick-RNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research). RNA libraries were prepared using a poly(A) enrichment-based mRNA library preparation kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on the NovaSeq X Plus Series (PE150). Reads were aligned to the reference genome (GRCh38) using Rsubread, and gene expression was quantified with featureCounts. For analysing pathway enrichment, gene set co-regulation analysis (GESECA) was performed with hallmark gene sets from the Human Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). To reduce redundancy, we performed hierarchical clustering of hallmark gene sets with Jaccard's distance to yield eight gene-set clusters with minimal gene overlaps. Only one gene set with the lowest false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P value per cluster is shown in Fig. 5. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2, with FDR-adjusted P < 0.05 as a threshold for differential expression. Heat maps were created using normalized counts of genes identified as differentially upregulated or downregulated in both sustained versus unstimulated and transient versus unstimulated comparisons.

The main-text SPR, circular dichroism, FP, FRET and luminescence experiments, and also a subset of the DEER and SEC experiments, were performed twice (SPR in Figs. 2d,h and 4b; FRET in Fig. 4c; and SEC in Supplementary Fig. 9a) or three times (SPR in Fig. 2a,e–g; FP in Fig. 4b and Supplementary Figs. 5c and 12; luminescence in Fig. 4d,e; SEC in Supplementary Fig. 6b; and DEER with AS1 in Extended Data Fig. 2) to ensure reproducibility and low variance, and one representative experiment was reported owing to low variance among replicates. Having established low variance for these experiments, some similar measurements reported in the Supplementary Information were performed once. For all microscopy, cell staining, qPCR and RNA-seq experiments, three or four independent biological replicates were performed unless otherwise noted in the figure legend. All attempted replications of all experiments were successful, with the exception that some batches of YT-1 cells were unresponsive to stimulation; the findings in Fig. 5h were not observed with those batches. Allocation was random. No sample size calculations were performed; rather the sample sizes were chosen based on experience and were sufficient for the important observed differences between groups to be strongly statistically significant.

a, Crystal structure of AS5 alone (grey) overlaid with the design model of AS5 in state X (blue). Inset shows a detailed view of side chains in the partially open effector-binding cleft. b, Cocrystal structure of AS5 and peptide effector (grey) overlaid with the design model of the AS5–effector complex in state Y (AS5 in blue, effector in orange). Inset shows the same view of the side chains in the effector-binding cleft as in a. c, Design model of AS1 in state X (blue) aligned to the target (pink), showing a minor clash. d, Three cocrystal structures of AS1 (with intact cleft) and target with methylated lysines (grey) overlaid with the AF2 model of the target–AS1 complex in state X (AS1 in blue, target in pink), showing fluctuation in the target binding conformation.

a, Raw DEER traces (black), foreground fits (colours), and background fits (grey) for AS1 and AS114 with all combinations of target and effector. Experiments on complexes included the target, effector, or both in excess over the host at concentrations higher than required to fully form the complex (Supplementary Fig. 9), and spin labels were placed far from the target and effector binding sites. Thus, changes in the DEER distance distributions with different combinations of target and effector should only reflect changes in host conformation. b, Distance distributions from experiment (colours) and simulated from the structural state represented by the cartoons (black). For AS1, the simulated and experimental distance distributions agree well, further validating that each state adopts its designed conformation. For AS114, the simulations consistently overestimate the experimental distribution by ~5 Å, but the shift in the distance distributions with the effector compared to those without validates the designed conformational change. c, Experimental distance distributions of all states, coloured corresponding to b. For both AS1 and AS114, the ternary complex distribution (green) aligns with the host–effector complex distribution (orange) and not with the host alone (blue) or target–host complex (pink) distributions, confirming that the ternary complex is primarily in state Y. b,c, Lines represent the distance distribution which best fits the time domain data; shaded regions represent 95% confidence intervals from bootstrapping (Methods).

a, The Cα RMSD of the MD trajectories from the crystal structure (grey) is lower than from the aligned clashing design models of target and host–effector complex (black), showing that the MD simulations strain away from the clashing state in a manner similar to the crystal structure. b, Cα RMSD of the switch (blue) and target (pink) from their position in the crystal structure when the entire structures are aligned. Compared to trajectories 1 and 2, trajectory 3 shows reduced target deformation and increased switch deformation, showing that these trajectories differ in where they localize strain to resolve the clash. c, Per-residue Cα RMSF of the host (blue), target (pink), and effector (orange) in the ternary complex computed from each trajectory. The clashing region of the target (highlighted in grey) shows considerable flexibility, according with this region being disordered in the crystal structure. d, Comparison of MD simulations to experimental data. Left, crystal conformation of the ternary complex (grey) aligned to representative conformations from each MD trajectory (red, yellow, and light blue). DEER spin-label positions are shown in green. In the crystal structure, the clashing region on the target is disordered. In the MD simulations, although flexible, this region remains mostly ordered, causing additional deformation compared to the crystal structure. Illustrating the differences in strain localization among trajectories shown in b, in the first two trajectories (red and yellow), the switch conformation aligns with the crystal structure and the target deforms more; in the third trajectory (light blue), the target conformation aligns with the crystal structure and the switch deforms instead. Right, experimentally measured DEER distance distribution of the ternary complex (green line representing the best fit to the time domain data and shaded region representing 95% confidence interval from bootstrapping (Methods)) and distance distributions simulated from the crystal structure (grey line) or MD trajectories (dashed lines, colours correspond to the conformations shown at left). The distance distribution simulated from the crystal structure aligns with the left peak in the experimental distance distribution, whereas the distance distributions simulated from the MD trajectories span the experimental distance distribution, suggesting that these trajectories more fully sample the space of ternary complex dynamics.

a, Ratios of fold accelerations in the forward direction to those in the reverse direction, given by the equation: acceleration ratio = (koff,T:HE/koff,T:H) ÷ (koff,TH:E/koff,H:E). Acceleration ratios corresponding to designs with asymmetric distributions of strain are coloured orange, and to symmetric blue. b, Plot of forward vs reverse acceleration ratios, with linear fits for the symmetric and asymmetric groups. Note that on a log-log plot, the slope of a straight line passing through the origin becomes the y-intercept. c, For each design, design model of host–effector complex in state Y (blue and orange) aligned to the target (pink) to show the designed allosteric clash, and (grey) AF2 prediction of the target position relative to the switch in the ternary complex to show how the clash resolves through global strain. The target deforms downward in designs with an asymmetric distribution of strain, shearing the beta sheet, whereas it deforms outward in designs with a more symmetric distribution of strain, bending the beta sheet. d, Comparison of the AS1 binder–target interface (left) and switch–effector interface (right) (aligned at the host side) in the binary (colours) and ternary (grey) complex conformations, all from crystal structures, showing the binder–target interface deforms substantially more than the switch–effector interface in the ternary complex.

a, Design model of E2–target, comprising the target LHD101A (with mutations R43V and V69Q) fused to the effector peptide “E2” (cs201B) for hinge cs201. E2 is coloured green and LHD101A is coloured pink. b, Design models of E2–target (green/pink) bound to AS114 (blue) in state X showing no clash (left) and in state Y with the effector peptide (orange) showing a strong clash (right). c, Design models of the reporter hinge “H2” (cs201F with mutation E249L (sticks) which increases E2 on-rate and labelled with Alexa Fluors 555 and 647 at positions indicated by stars) in state X (left) and in state Y with E2–target (right). AS114 and H2 would overlap considerably if simultaneously bound to E2–target, so their binding should be mutually exclusive: AS114 should cage E2 until its release by the effector. d, Kinetics of E2–target and H2 association, measured by a change in FRET efficiency due to the conformational change in H2 upon binding. (Left) FRET time courses (normalized to the initial signal) with varying concentrations of E2–target and 5 nM H2; data (circles) fit with single exponentials (lines). (Right) apparent on-rate constants plotted against E2–target concentration (circles) and a linear fit. The value of the association rate constant (5e + 4 M−1s−1) is higher than the reported value (4.5e + 3 M−1s−1) for the original hinge cs201F with effector cs201B, suggesting that mutation E249L on H2 biases its conformational pre-equilibrium toward state Y to increase the apparent association rate. e, Additional data for the kinetically governed chain reaction shown in Fig. 4c. In the grey control time course, 500 nM AS114 was added to 20 nM H2, then 1 μM effector and 6 μM target was added at time 0, showing that none of these components bind to H2 to cause a change in FRET signal. In the other time courses, pre-incubated 500 nM AS114 and 250 nM E2–target was added to 20 nM H2, then buffer (blue), 1 μM effector (green), 6 μM target (pink), or both (orange) were added at time 0. A baseline drift (obtained from 500 nM AS114 after adding 20 nM H2 then at time 0 adding buffer) was subtracted from each time course, and time courses were normalized to the initial signal. The chain reaction proceeds faster when just excess target is added, probably due to blocking rebinding of E2–target to AS114 after transient dissociation39, but this effect is insufficient to achieve full acceleration. The chain reaction also proceeds faster when just effector is added, but probably due to transient rebinding of E2–target to re-form the strained ternary complex, this also does not achieve full acceleration. Adding both effector (to accelerate E2–target dissociation from AS114) and excess target (to prevent E2–target rebinding to AS114) is required to fully accelerate the chain reaction. Note that if a single-chain effector is desired to fully accelerate the chain reaction, the effector and target could be flexibly fused into a single construct. Such a multivalent effector would be reminiscent of CITED2, whose multivalency enables rapid and unidirectional competition against HIF-1α (ref. 102).

a, Structural model of the best SARS-CoV-2 sensor construct, comprising AScov (blue), the SmBiTgraft peptide with the effector (orange) and grafted SmBiT (green), LgBiT (grey or cyan), and flexible linkers (black). In this design, SmBiT is caged in a helical conformation when SmBiTgraft is bound to the switch and is free to reconstitute the luciferase when SmBiTgraft is released. To form SmBiTgraft, SmBiT was grafted onto the effector peptide such that most of its hydrophobic residues are buried within the switch–SmBiTgraft interface when in the bound helical conformation. Because the original effector peptide binds so strongly to the switch, it could accommodate replacing some of its interface residues with residues from SmBiT without reducing its affinity so much that it no longer effectively cages the SmBiT. b, SPR data showing sfGFP-SmBiTgraft binding to AS0 (blue and orange, association phase), slow subsequent dissociation in the absence of target (blue), and rapid subsequent dissociation upon addition of 10 μM target (orange) caused by rapid target binding to form a transient ternary complex, causing the spike at the beginning of the dissociation phase. c–f, Rapidly sensing the target through a facilitated dissociation mechanism (top), slowly sensing the effector limited by the slow base exchange rate of SmBiTgraft between binding AS0 and LgBiT (middle), and rapidly sensing the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with facilitated dissociation (bottom). c, Schematics showing the mechanism of sensing. d, Luminescence time courses (normalized to the initial signal) of 10 pM sensor construct then at time 0 adding varying concentrations of analyte (target, effector, or SARS-CoV-2 RBD); data (colours) fit (black) with single exponentials up to the maximum signal for time courses which showed appreciable signal increase. In some time courses, signal slowly decreases due to depletion of luciferase substrate. e, Luminescence signal fold change plotted against analyte concentration. f, Sensor response rate constant plotted against analyte concentration for time courses that showed appreciable signal increase.

a, Schematic depiction of the labelling strategy for single-molecule tracking experiments. b, Single-molecule trajectories of IL-2Rβ (red), γc (blue) and ASNeo2-induced heterodimers (magenta). c, Data from Fig. 5e as box plots to display datapoint variation including Neo2 (+/- effector) (green and orange, left side) and single-molecule tracking experiments with labelled ASNeo2 and γc (right side). Sample sizes and independent repeats are: unstimulated: 37 and 3; ASNeo2: 32 and 3; ASNeo2 + Effector: 33 and 3; Neo2: 44 and 4; Neo2 + Effector: 26 and 2; labelled ASNeo2: 21 and 2; labelled ASNeo2 + Effector: 18 and 2. d, Relative dimerization in relation to receptor cell surface density ratio indicates that high dimerization data variance is caused by differing IL-2Rβ to γc ratios at the plasma membrane. Even at high γc excess, effector-bound ASNeo2 shows no residual affinity for γc. e, Diffusion properties of IL-2Rβ and γc are reverted to the ground state after addition of effector. f, Immobile particles are increased upon stimulation, but not decreased after effector addition, potentially indicating receptors internalizing in membrane proximal endosomes. For e,f, the left box always corresponds to IL-2Rβ and the right one to γc. Sample sizes for d–f are as in c. g, Normalized localization density over time confirms minimal single-molecule bleaching in long-term single-molecule tracking experiments. Sample sizes and independent repeats are: without Effector: 5 and 5; with Effector: 3 and 3. h,i, Dissociation of ASNeo2-induced IL-2Rβ/γc dimers at the cell surface upon addition of 10 µM effector as detected by time-lapse single-molecule co-tracking (h) with colour-coded corresponding co-trajectories (i). j,k, Conformational change of ASNeo2 bound to the cell-surface receptor probed by smFRET. j, FRET efficiency histograms for ASNeo2 E4C/K211C labelled with Cy3B and ATTO643 bound to cells expressing IL-2Rβ and γc in the absence (blue) and presence (yellow) of 10 µM effector. Sample sizes are: without Effector: 7; with Effector: 5. k, smFRET co-localizations of one individual cell before the effector was added (left) and after it was added (right) colour-coded for FRET efficiency, highlighting the observation of individual molecules. Statistics for c,e,f were performed using two-sided two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests (ns, not significant, P values noted). Box plots show the distribution of the dataset, highlighting the median, quartiles, and outliers, with whiskers extending to the range limits. Scale bars in b,i: 5 µm.

a, Design models of ASNeo2 and selected cyclic permutations in state X, rainbow-coloured from N terminus (blue) to C terminus (red) to illustrate the protein topology. In ASNeo2, the switch is at the N terminus and Neo2 is at the C terminus. In the cyclic permutations, although the relative position of the switch and Neo2 changes minimally, the switch is in the middle of the protein, part of Neo2 is at the N terminus, and the other part is at the C terminus. This way, the regulatory switch cannot degrade without also breaking Neo2. b, SEC purifications performed on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column. The cyclic permutations are prone to aggregation during expression, but distinct monomer peaks can be picked out. c, Fast effector-concentration-dependent dissociation of γc from the ASNeo2–IL-2Rβ–γc complex upon addition of peptide effector. Data (grey) fit (colours) as described in methods (neglecting the accumulation modelling because accumulation on the SPR surface was negligible with these proteins). d, Rate constants of facilitated γc dissociation computed from the model fit by ln(2)÷{half-time of γc–host interaction} plotted against effector concentration (circles) and fit with hyperbolic equations (black lines).

Human T cells were stimulated with 1 nM (a–g) or 5 nM (i) ASNeo2 for 5 min (a–h), 30 min (h), or 25 min (i) or left untreated as a control. Signalling was either sustained by continued ASNeo2 treatment or terminated by the addition of 10 μM effector. Cells were collected for counting and phenotypic analysis by flow cytometry after 72 h (b,c; n = 4) or 48 h (a,e–g; n = 4), for pSTAT signalling analysis by flow cytometry after 20 min (h, n = 3), or for RNA-seq analysis after 6 h (i, n = 3). a, Changes in viable T cell counts from 0 h to 48 h across each group. b,c, Representative flow-cytometry histogram of CFSE (b) and quantitative analysis of divided cells (c). d, Frequencies of live T cells. e, Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of Ki-67, CD25, GATA3, CD69, and BCL2. f,g, Representative flow-cytometry plots (f) and quantitative analysis of caspase-3+ cells (g; n = 4). h, Dose-dependent pSTAT5 curves. i, Transcripts per million (TPM) of CDK4 and POLD2 in the MYC_TARGETS_V1 gene set (left); TPM of DOCK2 and KIF1B in the MITOTIC_SPINDLE gene set (right). a,c–e,g, Statistics were obtained from ANOVA with two-sided Tukey's post-test (ns, not significant (P > 0.05), *P = 0.04, **P = 0.001, ***P = 0.0002, ****P < 0.0001).

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

One of the hardest things about exploring the quantum world is that many of the phenomena in this “invisible” realm occur at mind-bogglingly small scales.

Take, for example, what is known as the quantum Hall effect. First discovered in 1980 by German physicist Klaus von Klitzing, this effect describes the behavior of electrons (under the influence of a magnetic field and approaching absolute zero temperatures) as they pass through 2D materials, such as graphene. Usually, you'd expect the electrons to experience resistance and scatter, but under these conditions, they formed lossless energy states locked along the material's boundary. 

This quantization of electrical resistance, known as an “edge state,” is particularly useful if you want to create exotic materials free of electrical resistance. But there's just one problem. 

“These states occur over femtoseconds, and across fractions of a nanometer, which is incredibly difficult to capture,” Richard Fletcher, an assistant professor at MIT, said in a press statement. A femtosecond is one quadrillionth of a second. “The beauty is seeing with your own eyes physics which is absolutely incredible but usually hidden away in materials and unable to be viewed directly.”

To actually study this quantum interaction on a more reasonable scale, Fletcher—along with his colleagues at MIT's Research Laboratory of Electronics and the MIT-Harvard Center for Ultracold Atoms—decided on a novel method to essentially scale up this phenomenon using a cloud of ultracold sodium atoms instead of electrons. 

According to the researchers, this allowed the team to watch these edge states form “over milliseconds and microns,” which are much more manageable experimental parameters. The results of the study were published in the journal Nature Physics.

To create this quantum interaction on a bigger scale took a large amount of experimental ingenuity. The team used one million ultracold sodium atoms and essentially trapped them in a complex set-up of lasers. However, to simulate the experience of living in a flat space, the researchers also spun them like “riders on an amusement park Gravitron.”

“The trap is trying to pull the atoms inward, but there's centrifugal force that tries to pull them outward,” Fletcher said. “The two forces balance each other, so if you're an atom, you think you're living in a flat space, even though your world is spinning. There's also a third force, the Coriolis effect, such that if they try to move in a line, they get deflected. So these massive atoms now behave as if they were electrons living in a magnetic field.”

Scientists then defined the “edge” of this gaseous material by introducing a laser, which formed a wall around the atoms. Once atoms encountered this light, they flowed in just one direction—much like electrons at ultra-small quantum scales. 

“You can imagine these are like marbles that you've spun up really fast in a bowl, and they just keep going around and around the rim of the bowl,” Martin Zwierlein, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “There is no friction. There is no slowing down, and no atoms leaking or scattering into the rest of the system. There is just beautiful, coherent flow.”

To test these atoms' resistances, the team then placed obstacles—such as a point of light—in their paths, and the atoms passed by without any measurable resistance. 

Now that scientists have a reliable stand-in for this quantum process, future experiments can push these interactions to the “edge” and begin to explore unknown frontiers of this fascinating piece of quantum physics.

The location of Cleopatra's burial has remained a mystery since her death, but a sunken port might be a key to finding it.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Cleopatra VII was the last pharaoh to ever ascend the throne of Egypt. She wielded political power by allying her kingdom with Rome and, at one point, was the richest woman on Earth. She even declared herself the living incarnation of the goddess Isis. But despite her fame and infamy (she allegedly ordered her lover Mark Antony to demand the execution of her own sister), her tomb has never been found.

Rumors of its location have been swirling since Cleopatra's death around two thousand years ago. She and Antony were supposedly buried together after Egypt was defeated by the forces of Augustus Caesar, (with him falling on his sword and her reportedly allowing a deadly asp to take her life), but neither body has ever surfaced. 

That hasn't stopped experts from searching. According to the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, archaeologist and Cleopatra enthusiast Kathleen Martinez (along with her research team) recently discovered a port on the ocean floor that was unmistakably linked to a temple that Martinez believes could hold the body of the infamous queen.

It has long been thought that Cleopatra had been interred somewhere in her birthplace of Alexandria, but Martinez had a different idea. She believes that the queen actually sought her final resting place in a temple of Isis.

Eventually, Martinez and her team investigated the temple of Taposiris Magna—dedicated to Osiris, husband of Isis and king of the Egyptian pantheon. Built by pharaoh Ptolemy II Philadelphus (an ancestor of Cleopatra) between 280 and 270 B.C.E., it used to be a grand temple, but over time, Taposiris Magna has been reduced to crumbling walls and eroded monuments rising out of the sand. And it was there that Martinez and her team found their port, which just so happened to be underwater.

Thousands of years ago, the port stood firmly on land. The coastline was four kilometers (about 2.5 miles) further out during Cleopatra's time, but today, it has encroached to the point that the port is in a much more waterlogged state than it would have been upon construction. Among the remains of the port were columns, cemented blocks, and polished stone floors. The seafloor was littered with anchors and amphora.Martinez had previously explored a subterranean tunnel that led from Taposiris Magna to the Mediterranean Sea, which ended in a group of structures her team refers to as Salam 5. The sunken port is an extension of that, and adds to the trove of objects previously unearthed at Taposiris Magna. Prior finds include coins stamped with Cleopatra's profile, bronze statuettes, oil lamps, ceramic vessels used in rituals, and limestone vessels for storage. A scarab amulet inscribed with The justice of Ra shines appears to be a royal talisman. (If the tomb of the iconic queen is ever found, it could possibly dull the shine of King Tut's cache of gilded treasures.)

Whether the tomb of Cleopatra could have also have ended up submerged is still unknown, and its location still eludes Martinez. But she is determined to keep searching.

Small molecular food components contribute to the health benefits of diets rich in fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices. The cellular mechanisms by which noncaloric bioactives promote healthspan are not well understood, limiting their use in disease prevention. Here, we deploy a whole-organism, high-content screen in zebrafish to profile food-derived compounds for activation of autophagy, a cellular quality control mechanism that promotes healthy aging. We identify thymol and carvacrol as activators of autophagy and mitophagy through a transient dampening of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Chemical stabilization of thymol-induced mitochondrial depolarization blocks mitophagy activation, suggesting a mechanism originating from the mitochondrial membrane. Supplementation with thymol prevents excess liver fat accumulation in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, improves pink-1-dependent heat stress resilience in Caenorhabditis elegans, and slows the decline of skeletal muscle performance while delaying epigenetic aging in SAMP8 mice. Thus, terpenoids from common herbs promote autophagy during aging and metabolic overload, making them attractive molecules for nutrition-based healthspan promotion.

Despite an extraordinary increase in lifespan over the past 170 years1, the prevalence of chronic diseases among the rapidly growing population of older adults remains high due to environmental, lifestyle and nutritional factors2. Among these, inadequate nutrition makes a major contribution to the onset and progression of noncommunicable diseases and mortality. The intake of excess calories, as well as the overconsumption or underconsumption of specific food and nutrient groups, has been associated with a wide range of negative health outcomes3. Prevention through nutritional approaches, sometimes referred to as ‘food as first medicine', is therefore gaining importance in lowering the burden of noncommunicable diseases4. Beyond recommendations for adequate portion sizes and balanced consumption of nutrient-dense foods, specific dietary patterns are effective tools for disease prevention. For instance, caloric restriction and regimens under the umbrella term of intermittent fasting, such as alternate-day fasting, 5:2 fasting and time-restricted eating, show promise in promoting healthy aging not only through weight loss but also through other mechanisms independent of changes in weight5,6,7,8. At the cellular level, various molecular adaptations promote the health benefits of caloric restriction and intermittent fasting, among which the activation of autophagy is believed to be a principal mechanism explaining their geroprotective effects9. Autophagy prevents proteotoxicity and cellular damage by recycling protein aggregates and dysfunctional organelles, leading to improved organism resilience against metabolic challenges and other age-related cellular stressors10. The requirement for intact autophagy to mediate the benefits of caloric restriction in extending healthspan and lifespan has been demonstrated by genetic loss-of-function experiments in a wide range of experimental models (including yeast, worms and flies) carrying deletions in genes related to autophagy11. Similar findings have been confirmed in mammals. For example, genetic ablation of autophagy in the liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle or hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin neurons of mice abolishes the system-wide beneficial effects of intermittent fasting, suggesting a conserved role of autophagy for healthy aging in mammals12.

The uptake of dietary patterns that activate autophagy is complicated by the need for low-calorie intake over an extended period before autophagy is efficiently induced. In addition, the efficacy with which fasting activates autophagy shows a large variability across individuals13. To circumvent these challenges, small molecules could be used to mimic the benefits of fasting and caloric restriction while following a diet with normal or only slightly reduced caloric intake14. Such a strategy should ideally be based on food-grade ingredients that activate autophagy and can be used in a dietary context for preventive health before drugs are medically indicated. For example, spermidine, urolithin A and resveratrol have been shown to provide broad health benefits across organ systems, with a remarkable level of conservation across species15,16,17,18,19. However, the number of natural bioactive compounds that can be safely used at efficacious levels in food and beverage formats remains small, limiting the potential to promote autophagy as part of diets that can be widely adopted for disease prevention.

In this study, we developed and deployed a rapid testing approach in zebrafish as a suitable whole-organism model for small-molecule discovery, with the aim of finding food-grade autophagy activators20. Zebrafish have been used to measure autophagy in vivo, providing a vertebrate model that recapitulates organismal complexity21,22. In practice, the use of zebrafish for the discovery of autophagy modulators has been limited by the need for microscopy and the quantification of autophagy in individual animals23,24. In this study, we established an in vivo workflow for the discovery of autophagy modulators using a transgenic construct in which ZsGreen is tagged to the autophagosome-localized protein LC3 (encoded by map1lc3), combined with high-content image acquisition and analysis in live zebrafish. We tested a library of natural bioactive molecules and identified thymol and carvacrol, major components of thyme and oregano, as autophagy inducers in zebrafish, mice and human cells. Mechanistically, thymol transiently lowers the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), triggering a cellular stress response that promotes the recycling of damaged mitochondria. Thymol supplementation reduces hepatic fat content in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, delays age-related phenotypes in worms, and lowers epigenetic age in conjunction with improved muscle performance in a naturally occurring mouse strain affected by premature mobility decline.

Autophagy requires the conjugation of the cytosolic LC3 protein (LC3-I) with the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3-II on the surface of autophagosomes25. The change from a dispersed cytosolic presence of LC3-I to the formation of vesicular structures rich in LC3-II can be exploited in confocal microscopy to visualize autophagosomes. We developed a zebrafish model in which we tagged the fluorescent reporter protein ZsGreen in frame to the 5′ end of map1lc3. To drive the expression of the reporter gene in skeletal muscle, we used the skeletal muscle-specific promoter of actc1b and generated Tg(actc1b:ZsGreen-map1lc3;cryaa:TdTomato) zebrafish, hereafter named actc1b:ZsGreen-LC3 (Fig. 1a,b and Extended Data Fig. 1a). Next, we set up an image acquisition and analysis pipeline that detects LC3-positive puncta for in vivo quantification of autophagosomes (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b). Profiling of zebrafish larvae showed that the number of autophagosomes increased from 3 to 6 days post fertilization (dpf) (Fig. 1c,d). Cotreatment with the lysosomotropic agent ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), an inhibitor of autophagosome degradation, increased the accumulation of LC3 puncta compared to baseline from 4 dpf, demonstrating a bona fide increase in autophagic flux (Fig. 1d)26. This result is consistent with autophagy activation during the transition of zebrafish larvae from the ‘yolk-feeding' stage at 3 dpf to a state of limited energy substrate availability due to yolk consumption at 6 dpf (ref. 27). To enable the discovery of previously unidentified autophagy modulators in vivo, we implemented a semiautomated multistep protocol as summarized in Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1c. We opted for an early time window, with analysis at 3 dpf when endogenous autophagic flux is low. Specifically, we distributed larvae at 2 dpf into 96-well microplates. After incubation with the compound of interest, the larvae were immobilized through treatment with an anesthetic before image acquisition as described above. Following the first acquisition, the anesthetic was washed out and the larvae were treated with NH4Cl before a second round of imaging was performed.

For validation, larvae were treated with rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor with well-established effects on autophagy induction in mammals. mTOR activity was abolished after 20 h of treatment of wild-type larvae, as demonstrated by S6 protein phosphorylation (Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). Accordingly, treatment of actc1b:ZsGreen-LC3 larvae for 16 h enhanced autophagic flux in the absence of NH4Cl, and the same effect was observed following 4 h of incubation with NH4Cl (Fig. 1f,g). Next, we tested the evolutionary conservation of autophagy modulation in zebrafish by performing a pilot screen using a commercial collection of 240 synthetic and natural pharmacophores. Among the seven hits that were identified, three small molecules—ceramide, calpeptin and retinoic acid—have been previously reported to induce autophagy in mammalian cells (Extended Data Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 1)28,29,30.

These results validate zebrafish as a model for quantifying autophagy levels in vivo, while the semiautomatic analysis pipeline provides a rapid workflow for the discovery of autophagy inducers.

To enrich a screening library for molecules with a favorable safety profile for human translation, we next curated a list of natural bioactive compounds from edible sources and endogenous metabolites, including vitamins, bioactive molecules from herbs and spices, and human serum metabolites (Supplementary Table 2). The molecules were screened at concentrations from 10 to 250 µM and were ranked according to their maximum efficacy (Emax) in the presence of NH4Cl (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 2). The analysis included high-content imaging of LC3-positive puncta in more than 2,500 larvae in the presence or absence of NH4Cl. Carvacrol and thymol, terpenoids abundant in essential oils derived from common thyme (Thymus vulgaris) and oregano (Origanum vulgare), were the most potent autophagy activators among all the screened bioactive ingredients (Fig. 2a). Images of actc1b:ZsGreen-LC3 larvae demonstrated an accumulation of LC3 puncta at baseline, with a further increase after the addition of NH4Cl (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 2a). Both molecules showed a dose–response relationship, with substantial effects on autophagy starting from 50 µM for carvacrol and 10 µM for thymol (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). Thymol and carvacrol constitute up to 60% of all phytochemicals in the oil fraction of oregano and thyme31. Therefore, we hypothesized that oregano essential oil, a natural product extracted from dry oregano leaves and containing the monoterpenoids carvacrol, p-cymene and thymol (Extended Data Table 1), exhibits bioactivity related to autophagy. Consistent with this, we observed that treatment with oregano essential oil induced a robust increase in autophagic flux (Fig. 2c). Notably, thymol, carvacrol and oregano essential oil demonstrated similar efficacy to rapamycin at the doses tested, making them promising candidates for exploring autophagy-dependent health benefits. Considering the structural similarity and comparable efficacy of thymol and carvacrol, we chose thymol as the lead ingredient for subsequent experiments, based on the availability of pharmacokinetic studies in humans32. As thymol is metabolized through phase II reactions, we assessed the efficacy of thymol sulfate and thymol glucuronide, the two most prevalent metabolites in human blood after thymol ingestion32. Remarkably, both thymol sulfate and thymol glucuronide induced autophagy similarly to free thymol (Fig. 2d,e), indicating that the conjugation of thymol does not interfere with its bioactivity. Thymol did not affect S6 and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, suggesting that autophagy is not directly activated through these canonical regulatory pathways (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).

In summary, we identified thymol and carvacrol as potent autophagy inducers that are naturally found in oregano and thyme.

We next aimed to determine how thymol induces autophagy and whether the mode of action is conserved across species. Jurkat cells, a human cell line that grows in suspension, can be used to measure autophagic flux through flow cytometry. Treatment with thymol increased the LC3-II signal in the presence of the lysosomal inhibitor starting at 62.5 µM (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Based on previous reports that thymol intercalates into lipid bilayers, we hypothesized that thymol acts at the level of the mitochondrial membrane to activate autophagy33,34,35. Thymol caused a mild decrease in the MMP, as detected by a fluorometric shift in JC-10 emission from orange, which represents the aggregate form, to green, representing the monomeric form, compared to the chemical uncoupler FCCP (Fig. 3c). Cell viability was not affected even in the presence of 250 µM thymol for up to 6 h, suggesting that autophagy is not a result of cellular toxicity (Extended Data Fig. 3b). To confirm similar bioactivity on mitochondrial membranes, we quantified the MMP in Jurkat cells treated with carvacrol and found a comparable effect to that of thymol (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Consistent with membrane depolarization, treatment with thymol and carvacrol increased mitochondrial superoxide generation, suggesting a mechanism that originates at the mitochondrial membrane (Extended Data Fig. 3d).

Changes in the MMP can affect the respiratory chain and modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Therefore, we measured the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in mitochondria purified from mouse livers that were treated ex vivo with a range of thymol doses. Consistent with our previous observation that thymol affects the MMP, we found a dose-dependent effect on mitochondrial respiration with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 295.7 ± 6.7 µM in healthy mitochondria (Fig. 3d). Based on these results, we validated the effects through a different method for quantifying the MMP, in which we used primary mouse adult fibroblasts (MAFs) from the same animal model used for OCR quantification. MAFs were treated with thymol for 24 h and then exposed to the fluorescent dye TMRM, a sensitive marker for MMP changes. As expected, TMRM fluorescence was reduced in thymol-treated cells (Fig. 3e), leading to a significant decrease in the TMRM signal compared to that of the control (Student's t test, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3f). Carvacrol had similar effects on the MMP (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f).

We next asked whether thymol treatment leads to transcriptional adaptations consistent with changes in cellular energy homeostasis. QuantSeq 3′ mRNA sequencing revealed 273 differentially expressed genes in thymol-treated cells compared to controls (Extended Data Fig. 3g and Supplementary Table 3). Unbiased gene set analysis of cellular hallmarks revealed an anti-inflammatory gene expression signature, with three of the top seven pathways indicating downregulated inflammatory signaling, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling via nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and IL-6–JAK–STAT3 signaling (Fig. 3g). Notably, a gene signature consistent with the activation of an unfolded protein response was upregulated, indicative of a cellular stress response (Extended Data Fig. 3h and Supplementary Table 4). Further, a targeted Gene Ontology analysis of 24 curated biological processes related to cellular energy metabolism and autophagy showed upregulation of pathways linked to macroautophagy, autophagy and protein catabolic processes. In contrast, Gene Ontology terms related to the response to starvation were downregulated (Fig. 3h and Supplementary Table 5).

Depolarization of mitochondria is thought to induce autophagy and mitophagy, thereby initiating the targeted removal and replacement of cellular components, which results in improved resilience to energetic stressors and damage36. To be beneficial, this mechanism needs to be transient, without long-term inhibitory effects on cellular respiration, and should be moderate enough to predominantly affect damaged mitochondria. We first tested the kinetics of thymol's effects on mitochondrial respiration by measuring the OCR in zebrafish larvae. In this setup, we compared a vehicle group to a group of animals that were continuously exposed to thymol and to another group in which thymol treatment was replaced by vehicle treatment 30 min before the analysis (Fig. 3i). Consistent with the in vitro experiments in mammalian cells, thymol reduced basal respiration in larvae, with minor effects on uncoupled respiration, suggesting that thymol does not affect maximal respiratory capacity. Importantly, mitochondrial function was fully rescued within 30 min following the removal of thymol (Fig. 3j,k). We hypothesized that transient inhibition of mitochondrial respiration leads to autophagy, thereby removing toxic materials and improving overall cellular quality. To test whether thymol increases organismal resilience, we treated zebrafish larvae with the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone, a toxin whose effects have been previously shown to be counteracted by the activation of autophagy and mitophagy37. Pretreatment of larvae with thymol for 16 h at three different doses reduced rotenone-induced toxicity, indicating that thymol primes cells for improved resilience to mitochondrial damage (Fig. 3l).

In summary, these results show that the effects of thymol on mitochondrial membrane integrity and respiratory function are transient, reversible, and confer protection at both the cellular and organismal levels.

The activation of autophagy and the transient inhibition of mitochondrial respiration suggest that both mechanisms induced by thymol are functionally connected. To test whether thymol's effect of lowering of the MMP triggers the activation of mitophagy in addition to macroautophagy, we obtained MAFs derived from mito-QC reporter mice that carry a tandem mCherry-GFP tag fused to the mitochondrial targeting sequence of the outer mitochondrial membrane protein FIS1 (encoded by Fis1)38 (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Fibroblasts were derived from male mito-QC mice. Of note, all mice used in the study, including those receiving in vivo treatments, were male. When mitophagy is activated in these mice, mitochondria tagged by the reporter construct are delivered to lysosomes, where GFP fluorescence is quenched by the acidic environment of the lumen, resulting in red foci of mitochondria due to the remaining fluorescence emission of the mCherry signal. Treatment with thymol for 24 h led to a strong activation of mitophagy, measured by the appearance of red fluorescent puncta and quantified as the mitophagy index, defined as the ratio of mCherry-positive mitolysosomes to the total number of mCherry-GFP-positive mitochondria (Fig. 4a,b). In contrast, cotreatment with oligomycin, an inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP synthase that blocks proton efflux and prevents mitochondrial depolarization, attenuated the effect of thymol on mitophagy (Fig. 4a,b). Thus, thymol-induced mitochondrial depolarization is necessary to initiate the mitophagy process. Next, we turned to an in vivo mammalian model and performed oral gavage with two administrations of thymol at 20 mg kg−1 per dose using mito-QC reporter mice (Fig. 4c). Gastrocnemius muscle biopsies and liver samples were collected 2 h after the last treatment, and histological sections were imaged to assess mitophagy levels (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 4b). Oral thymol treatment resulted in a striking induction of mitophagy in skeletal muscle, as demonstrated by increases in the mitophagy index and the number of mCherry-positive mitochondria (Fig. 4e,f). In contrast, mitophagy activation in liver samples was similar between the thymol and vehicle groups, potentially limited by the timing of sampling relative to the pharmacodynamics of thymol, or due to the mosaic expression of the transgene as reported previously (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d)38,39.

Taken together, our results show that mitophagy activation by oregano terpenoids occurs both in vitro and in vivo and is triggered by a mechanism that requires mild and transient mitochondrial depolarization.

Autophagy enables the degradation of triglyceride-rich lipid droplets in hepatocytes, protecting against aberrant liver fat accumulation, a common phenotype in aging that is compounded by calorie-dense but nutrient-poor Western diets40. As thymol inhibits the respiratory capacity of liver mitochondria at elevated doses (Fig. 3d), we tested its effects on hepatic macroautophagy and mitophagy by western blot analysis in wild-type mice. Total tissue lysate and mitochondria were purified from liver tissue to determine markers of autophagy and mitophagy in response to oral treatment (Fig. 5a). Thymol increased the autophagic flux, measured as the LC3-II/LC3-I protein ratio, in conjunction with hyperphosphorylation of mitochondrial ubiquitin at the Ser-65 residue, suggesting mitophagy activation through canonical PINK-1/Parkin signaling (Fig. 5b,c). In contrast, the levels of the autophagy target P62 remained unchanged, potentially due to the variable timing with which these markers respond during different stages of the autophagic flux41.

Following this acute study, we set out to test whether thymol prevents the accumulation of excess liver fat in chronic conditions. Groups of mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and supplemented with 20 mg kg−1 of thymol or a vehicle control by gavage for 5 days per week over 8 weeks. A group of mice was fed a standard chow diet and received vehicle treatment by gavage to serve as a reference (Fig. 5d). At the end of the treatment, body weight was higher in mice fed a HFD than in their littermates that were fed a standard diet (Fig. 5e). Thymol had no effects on weight gain (Fig. 5e), body composition (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b) or food intake (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Blood glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were similar between the thymol-treated and control HFD-fed groups (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). In contrast, liver histological analysis revealed robust protection against steatosis and preserved tissue morphology in thymol-treated mice compared to the vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 5f). Oil Red O (ORO) analysis showed that the amount of lipid droplets decreased in the livers of animals treated with thymol, along with a reduction in tissue triglyceride content (Fig. 5g,h). Consistent with an enhancement of autophagy, we observed lower levels of P62, an autophagy cargo adaptor and substrate that becomes depleted in response to increased autophagic flux10 (Fig. 5i,j). No differences between groups were observed for the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, suggesting that autophagic flux stabilizes over the treatment period and leads to the degradation of autophagosomes and their cargo, including P62, without further changes in the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio.

Taken together, oral thymol intake acutely activates liver autophagy and mitophagy, preventing excess liver fat accumulation during a chronic HFD challenge, independent of changes in body weight.

Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-suited model organism for studying epistatic mechanisms that mediate the effects of small-molecule interventions on healthspan42. We first aimed to confirm an evolutionarily conserved effect of thymol and carvacrol on autophagy induction. We treated wild-type worms that carry a transgene in which GFP is fused to the C. elegans ortholog of MAP1LC3, leading to the expression of a GFP::LGG-1 reporter. Worms were exposed to thymol or carvacrol at different life stages and for varying durations of exposure. Thymol and carvacrol increased GFP::LGG-1 puncta in young (day 1) and adult worms in response to lifelong treatment (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig. 6a). The same effect was observed in aged animals (10 days old) treated throughout their lives or in response to a subchronic duration of 72 h (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig. 6a). Notably, autophagy levels in aged C. elegans treated with the terpenoids were robust and comparable to those observed in young worms, despite lower baseline autophagy levels (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig. 6a). Thus, thymol is effective in overcoming age-related declines in autophagy levels. Based on the ability to induce autophagy in C. elegans, we used a transgenic line carrying a mitochondria-targeted Rosella (mtRosella) reporter in the muscle cells of the body wall. This dual-fluorescent reporter coexpresses pH-sensitive GFP (mtGFP) and pH-insensitive DsRed. In this setup, we tested the ability of thymol to activate mitophagy in wild-type worms and pink-1 mutants lacking the membrane-bound PINK-1 protein, which initiates canonical mitophagy upon membrane depolarization43. Thymol robustly increased mitophagy signals in both young and aged worms (Fig. 6b–d). The reversal of age-related autophagy decline was absent in worms lacking functional PINK-1 signaling, demonstrating that thymol signals through canonical mitophagy activation (Fig. 6c,d).

Exposing cells to nonphysiological temperatures induces the expression of heat shock proteins, a group of chaperones that protect cellular components by forming protein aggregates44. We hypothesized that thymol increases resilience to heat stress through the turnover of protein aggregates and damaged mitochondria, thereby reinstating proteostasis that is perturbed by high temperatures. Exposure of C. elegans to a temperature of 37 °C for 4 h sharply reduced their activity score, a measure that assesses animal motility as a readout of recovery from the heat exposure (Fig. 6e–j). Thymol or carvacrol treatments 72 h before the heat shock robustly improved thermotolerance, measured as the percentage of active animals during a time course of 32 h after the thermal shock (Fig. 6e,f). We repeated the same experiment in worms with genetic deletions of daf-16, which is critical for autophagy signaling, and pink-1, the gatekeeper of canonical mitophagy signaling, to test dependency on these pathways45. Thymol did not protect worms deficient in daf-16 and pink-1, indicating that these genes are required for the benefits of thymol (Fig. 6g,h). C. elegans deficient in aak-2, the ortholog of genes encoding proteins of the AMPK complex in vertebrates, also interfered with thymol-dependent motility benefits, consistent with the upstream regulatory role of AMPK in the induction of autophagy and mitophagy46 (Fig. 6i). In contrast, the effects of thymol did not depend on skn-1, which encodes a transcription factor with conserved functions in oxidative stress responses to NRF2 in mammals47, indicating that the protective effects do not rely on reactive oxygen species signaling (Fig. 6j).

Next, we assessed motility as a surrogate for improved healthspan during lifelong treatments in microfluidic chambers. Activity scores improved in worms exposed to thymol at concentrations of 25 and 50 µM from 7 to 10 days of adulthood (Fig. 6k,l). Similar benefits regarding age-related motility were also observed when using conventional microplates, with thymol and carvacrol at concentrations of 25 and 50 µM consistently enhancing velocity and total traveled distance following treatments from the egg stage to 10 days of adulthood (Extended Data Fig. 6b–e).

Lastly, we asked whether the improved motility outcomes were also reflected in preserved anatomical structures. To this end, we used a strain that expresses MYO-3 tagged with GFP in body wall muscles and quantified the damage to myofibrils, which consist of the contractile proteins required for efficient movement. During aging, myofibers exhibit severe damage and decreased MYO-3 expression48. Thymol and carvacrol treatments preserved myofiber structure at 25 and 50 µM, while higher doses did not reduce damage (Fig. 6m and Extended Data Fig. 6f), suggesting that higher doses may lack benefits under chronic exposure. Moreover, both thymol and carvacrol increased the MYO-3::GFP fluorescence intensity at all tested doses, indicating healthier myofibrils (Extended Data Fig. 6g–i). We did not observe an effect on overall lifespan, potentially due to antagonistic effects under chronic exposure, among other reasons (Extended Data Fig. 6j,k).

In summary, thymol improves age-related motility and slows skeletal muscle decline by enhancing cellular resilience to aging and stress through the activation of autophagy and mitophagy.

The effects of thymol on autophagy across species and tissue types suggest broad benefits that collectively support healthy aging. To this end, we aimed to translate these findings to a mammalian model of progressive aging by studying SAMP8 (senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8) mice. This model is particularly suited for studying the aging of the brain and physical performance, two domains that have a major role in age-related disabilities in humans. SAMP8 mice are an inbred strain selected from a genetically heterogeneous population of mice. Specifically, these mice naturally develop early signs of aging, such as reduced locomotor performance, sarcopenia, and cognitive decline linked to an accumulation of protein aggregates and a loss of mitochondrial respiratory function. Therefore, they are considered a relevant model for human aging49,50. We administered thymol at a dose of 20 mg kg−1 per day or vehicle by oral gavage for 5 days per week over 12 weeks starting at 8 months of age (Fig. 7a). First, we analyzed DNA methylation patterns that predict age-adjusted health status. These methylation-based epigenetic clocks are emerging as relevant biomarkers of aging in mammals and are used to detect the beneficial effects of interventions designed to extend healthspan51. Notably, the skeletal muscle tissue of mice supplemented with thymol showed a reduction in epigenetic age, as assessed using a pan-tissue epigenetic clock52, of approximately 20% compared to the control group (Student's t test, P = 0.033) (Fig. 7b).

Source data

Similar to findings in mice fed a HFD, thymol treatment did not affect body weight (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Histological analysis of the tibialis anterior muscle showed larger myofibers in mice treated with thymol compared to controls (Fig. 7c). The frequency distribution of the muscle fiber area further showed a shift toward larger myofibers compared to untreated mice (Fig. 7d), resulting in an approximately 13% increase in the cross-sectional fiber area (Student's t test, P < 0.001) (Fig. 7e). Endurance was strikingly higher in the thymol-treated group than in the control group (Fig. 7f). Notably, average performance increased twofold from baseline in treated mice, whereas it remained stable in the controls, suggesting an improvement in performance induced by thymol, even in a life stage characterized by a decline in mobility (Fig. 7g). Grip strength was preserved throughout the study in the treatment group, showing a robust preventive effect against the decline of muscle strength compared to control animals (Fig. 7h). Numerically, strength decreased by 36% from baseline in the vehicle-treated controls but remained stable from baseline in the thymol-treated group (Fig. 7i). The weights of the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles did not show differences between the groups (Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). Furthermore, motor coordination and working memory capacity, measured by the rotarod test and the continuous Y maze task, improved in the group of mice treated with thymol (Extended Data Fig. 7d,e). Despite the remarkable phenotypic improvements, the levels of mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins and protein markers of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response remained unchanged, suggesting a relatively selective effect on mitophagy independent of major changes in the total mitochondrial mass (Extended Data Fig. 7f). Gene expression changes were moderate, with only one gene set related to anti-inflammatory responses showing significant enrichment (Fig. 7j and Supplementary Table 6). Of note, the gene set—hallmark TNF signaling via NF-κB—was similar to that found in MAFs in response to thymol treatment (Extended Data Fig. 7g). Western blot analysis of gastrocnemius tissue biopsies showed an increased amount of PINK-1 protein, indicating robust activation of mitophagy through canonical PINK-1 signaling (Fig. 7k,l).

Together, these data indicate that thymol treatment delays the age-related decline in muscle performance and lowers epigenetic age in SAMP8 mice.

Autophagy has emerged as a principal mechanism that maintains cellular functions during aging53. Here, we describe thymol and carvacrol, two isomeric phenolic monoterpenes derived from thyme and oregano, as inducers of autophagy and mitophagy both in vitro and in vivo, with conserved effects across species. Thymol and carvacrol are hydrophobic molecules with bactericidal properties due to their ability to intercalate into bacterial membranes, and they are thought to provide antipathogenic defenses33,34,35. Mitochondria evolved from ancestral proteobacteria through an endosymbiotic process, giving rise to the bioenergetic properties of aerobic eukaryotes54. Autophagy induction by thymol in our eukaryotic models is consistent with an effect on mitochondrial membranes that resembles bacterial membrane disruption. Molecules that intercalate into mitochondrial membranes, such as the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ, have been shown to depolarize mitochondria and trigger autophagy36. This depolarization stimulates the PINK-1-dependent recruitment of Parkin, which in turn mediates the elimination of mitochondria in lysosomes through mitophagy43. In support of this hypothesis, we show that thymol lowers oxygen consumption in live zebrafish and impairs oxygen flux in preparations of freshly isolated mitochondria from mouse hepatocytes. Mechanistically, the induction of mitophagy by thymol depends on PINK-1, while oligomycin—a chemical that inhibits proton flux across the mitochondrial membrane and thereby counteracts membrane depolarization—blunts thymol-induced mitophagy. These results provide robust evidence for a mitochondrial membrane-originating mechanism through which thymol activates autophagy by depolarizing mitochondria, thereby enhancing mitochondrial clearance both in vitro and in vivo.

Mild, transient mitochondrial perturbations activate cellular stress response mechanisms, including autophagy and mitophagy, leading to long-term benefits through a process known as mitohormesis55,56. Previous reports show that not all damaged mitochondria can be efficiently cleared by mitophagy unless a certain threshold of damage is crossed and autophagy is activated by independent mechanisms57,58. We propose that thymol has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile for achieving mitohormetic effects in vivo. Previous pharmacokinetic studies in animals and humans show that thymol has a rapid Tmax of 0.5 and 1.97 h, respectively, followed by relatively fast clearance, with a half-life of 10.2 h in humans32,59. This prompt clearance of circulating thymol suggests that cells are only transiently exposed to its effects. As a result, mitophagy is primarily activated in damaged mitochondria, while autophagy is not activated in healthy mitochondria with normal electrochemical coupling. Rapid absorption in the duodenum further suggests that oral intake leads to transient peaks in thymol and its conjugates, reaching levels sufficient to activate autophagy in tissues before they are cleared60. While the exact pharmacokinetic profile and pharmacodynamic mechanism of action of thymol on mitochondrial turnover remain to be established, its common use in traditional medicine supports its safety in humans61.

In metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease, autophagy is known to hydrolyze triacylglycerol from lipid droplets40. Mitophagy concomitantly increases the turnover of defective mitochondria, thereby facilitating fatty acid oxidation and efficient metabolic coupling, as well as protecting hepatocytes against aberrant liver fat accumulation62. Our findings show that chronic administration of thymol to mice fed a HFD resulted in a reduction in liver lipid deposition and lower levels of P62 protein. Thymol did not affect body weight, which aligns with the potential for caloric restriction mimetic effects independent of weight loss.

Next, we tested the ability of C. elegans to adapt to heat stress. Autophagy has been reported to promote thermotolerance due to its role in the removal of protein aggregates that form when cellular temperatures rise to toxic levels63. Thymol efficiently preserved activity in response to heat shock, suggesting that autophagy is the underlying protective mechanism. Finally, we showed that thymol-treated worms had increased motility with age, accompanied by a lower degree of myofiber damage, suggesting protection against the age-related decline in body wall muscle function and thereby preserving mobility. Based on these results, we turned to SAMP8 mice, which are characterized by the occurrence of protein aggregates in the brain and skeletal muscle, among other tissues50. Thymol demonstrated a remarkable restoration of motor performance, including improvements in strength and endurance. The functional benefits were accompanied by a lower epigenetic age determined using a pan-tissue clock readout, suggesting a potent antiaging effect at the tissue level and its relevance for translation. A limitation of our study is the use of male mice across the different in vivo experiments, a choice made due to the availability constraints of aged animals. Although testing the efficacy of thymol and carvacrol in females is an important next step, the consistent effects observed in zebrafish larvae (a stage before sex determination) and in the hermaphrodite C. elegans suggest a largely sex-independent mechanism.

While deploying different species and experimental models is a strength of this work, the approach of using zebrafish larvae has some limitations. Our discovery paradigm is likely to miss compounds that depend on signaling pathways not yet established during early larval stages, as well as those specific to old age. Other limitations include the difficulty in deciding doses for oral efficacy in preclinical models, a problem that we mitigated by relying on the known pharmacokinetics of thymol in humans and rodents.

Terpenoids and polyphenolic compounds are secondary plant metabolites enriched in diets characterized by a high contribution of fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices64. Some of these noncaloric phytonutrients are proposed to stimulate autophagy and mitophagy, potentially forming part of the overall health impact of these diets through the cumulative effects of bioactive mixtures65. Analyses of dietary habits among people living in areas with a high percentage of centenarians indicate that individuals with extraordinary healthspans consume diets rich in mitohormetic phytochemicals66. The limited knowledge of the overall intake doses of thymol from aromatic plants makes it challenging to perform a systematic analysis of its contribution to long-term benefits through diet. Nonetheless, carvacrol- and thymol-containing plants have been used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and bactericidal properties, although their mechanism of action has remained largely elusive67,68.

Secondary plant metabolites have numerous biological functions, including symbiotic advantages such as producing colors and flavors, conferring resistance to stressors (such as drought, heat and radiation) and possessing antipathogenic properties, among other functions that may explain their bioactivity in humans. In fact, a surprising number of plant bioactives have inhibitory or modulatory effects on cellular bioenergetic functions in eukaryotic cells. For example, biguanides from the French lilac (Galega officinalis) inhibit mitochondrial respiratory complex I69,70 and have served as the lead structures for the antidiabetic medication metformin. Resveratrol and related flavonoid polyphenols from grapes and berries have been shown to bind to and inhibit F1-ATPase, slowing ATP synthesis71. Here, we demonstrate that thymol activates autophagy and mitophagy through a mechanism initiated at the level of mitochondrial bioenergetics, which may be related to the bactericidal properties of thymol as part of its original function in pathogen defense. Thus, the activation of cellular stress pathways by thymol, and potentially other secondary plant metabolites that target bacterial membranes, may reflect moonlighting functions in mitochondrial bioenergetics, autophagy and mitophagy when ingested and absorbed into mammalian cells.

Beyond the induction of autophagy and mitophagy at the mitochondrial level, pleiotropic effects likely exist. For example, thymol's effects on bacteria could influence the gut microbiome, which mediates positive health outcomes from fasting and metformin treatment72,73. While our cellular experiments demonstrate a cell-autonomous effect on autophagy and mitophagy, the microbial activity of thymol may influence the composition of the host microbiome. Interestingly, oregano essential oil is used in animal feed to lower intestinal inflammation and improve immunity by modulating the composition of intestinal microbiota74,75. Transcriptional profiling in MAFs and within a systemic context in skeletal muscle biopsies from SAMP8 mice showed an enrichment of gene signatures compatible with a reduced inflammatory response. Additional studies are warranted to assess the effect of thymol on microbiota, particularly as thymol is believed to be readily absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract and may not reach the distal small intestine76.

In summary, this study broadens the mechanistic understanding of the health benefits mediated by oregano and thyme terpenoids and shows a potential link between their functions as secondary metabolites in plants and their effects on mitochondrial bioenergetics, autophagy and mitophagy in eukaryotic cells. Thymol is present at high concentrations in common oregano and thyme species and can be enriched in oregano essential oils, making it a relatively simple and cost-effective ingredient for nutrition-based prevention. A range of medical conditions are additional avenues to explore, including neurodegenerative diseases characterized by proteotoxicity, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, as well as the spectrum of inherited mitochondrial diseases.

All experiments adhered to Swiss regulations on animal experimentation and the European Community Council Directive 2010/63/EU. All procedures were approved by the Nestlé Ethical Committee (ASP-16-38-EXT), the Office Vétérinaire Cantonal Vaudois (VD2770, VD3195 and VD3484), and the Directorate General for Animal Health and Veterinary Drugs of the Italian Ministry of Health (authorization nos. 924/2021-PR and 885/2020-PR). Mice were housed under standard conditions with ad libitum access to food and water. C57BL/6 wild-type mice were purchased from Janvier Labs and were fed either a standard diet (D12450J, Research Diets) or a HFD (D12492, Research Diets). Mito-QC mice were kindly provided by I. Ganley, and SAMP8 AKR/J mice were obtained from Envigo. Thymol was dissolved in corn oil and administered orally. The dose was selected using allometric scaling based on previous pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in mice and humans32,67. For the acute studies, 10-week-old male mito-QC or wild-type mice on a C57BL/6 background received thymol at a dose of 20 mg per kg body weight, followed by a second dose 14 h later. Two hours after the second dose, the mice were killed. Organs from mito-QC mice were postfixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde and 200 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) at 4 °C for 24 h. Tissues were then cryopreserved in 30% sucrose/PBS at 4 °C for 2 days, frozen in chilled isopentane on dry ice and cryosectioned at 8 µm. For chronic treatments, 10-week-old C57BL/6 or 8-month-old SAMP8 male mice received thymol at a dose of 20 mg per kg body weight per day or vehicle (corn oil). The mice were killed at the end of the treatments, and tissues were collected for analysis.

The following C. elegans strains were used in this study: wild-type N2, DA2123 (adIs2122[lgg-1p::GFP::lgg-1+rol-6(su1006)]), CF1038 (daf-16(mu86)), RB2547 (pink-1(ok3538)), TG38 (aak-2(gt33)), QV225 (skn-1(zj15)), RW1596 (stEx30[pmyo-3GFP::MYO-3 + rol-6(su1006)]) and IR2539 (unc-119(ed3); Ex[pmyo‐3TOMM‐20::Rosella; unc‐119(+)]). All strains were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (funded by the National Institutes of Health Office of Research Infrastructure Programs P40 OD010440), except for the strain expressing the mtRosella biosensor, which was a kind gift from the Tavernarakis laboratory in Greece. For RNAi experiments, Escherichia coli HT115 bacteria were transformed with either the pink-1 (RNAi) construct or the empty PL4440 vector. Bacteria were grown overnight in liquid cultures containing ampicillin and tetracycline, followed by subculturing in liquid medium with ampicillin. Cultures were mixed with IPTG (2 mM), seeded onto plates and dried overnight. The next day, the animals were placed on the plates. HT115 bacteria expressing pink-1 (RNAi) were obtained from the Ahringer RNAi library (ID II-4K04).

Human lymphocytic T Jurkat cells (clone E6.1, ATCC, TIB-152) were used to measure autophagic flux in vitro. Cells were grown in complete RPMI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11875093) under standard conditions. For the experiment, cells were washed, counted and incubated at 1 × 105 cells per well in RPMI plus 10% human AB serum (GemCell, GeminiBio, 100-512) in duplicate in a 96-well plate with either rapamycin (Sigma-Aldrich, C2920), thymol (Sigma-Aldrich, 16254), carvacrol (Sigma-Aldrich, W224502), FCCP (Sigma-Aldrich, C2920), or 0.5% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, D8418) as the vehicle.

Primary MAFs were obtained from C57BL/6J or mito-QC mice. Biopsy tissues were cut into small pieces with a scalpel blade and distributed on coated dishes with 1.5 ml DMEM high glucose (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10569010) supplemented with 20% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 100-18B). Thymol (100 μM), carvacrol (100 µM), valinomycin (1 µM) (Sigma-Aldrich, V0627) and oligomycin (1 nM) (Sigma-Aldrich, O4876) were each dissolved in DMSO, added to the cell medium, and left for 24 h.

Three transgenic embryos per well were placed in 96-well plates and treated with compounds diluted in DMSO. After 16 h, the embryos were anesthetized with 0.016% tricaine (Sigma-Aldrich, E10521) and imaged using the ImageXpress Micro Confocal High-Content Imaging System (Molecular Devices). Tricaine was then washed out, and the embryos were treated with 100 mM NH4Cl (Sigma-Aldrich, 09718) for 4 h before being imaged again. For automated imaging, larval images were initially acquired using a 4× objective and analyzed with MetaXpress software (version 6.7.2). A custom Python code has been developed for the automated detection of larvae. The script records the coordinates of an area of the body at a fixed distance from the edges of the tail and the head. Twenty-six Z stacks of each area are acquired using a 20× objective. For the identification and quantification of ZsGreen-LC3 puncta, two-dimensional projections were analyzed. Images were processed as follows: individual Z stacks were projected onto single images using maximal projection. The projection was subsequently smoothed using serial operations, and this smoothed image was then subtracted from the maximal projection to remove the fish background from the puncta signal, resulting in a subtracted image. The smoothed image was then binarized to create the pre-fish body mask, which was cleaned using area filtering. The final object was then shrunk to represent the fish body mask. The mean intensity of the smoothed image covered by the fish body was measured and used to binarize the subtracted image and create the pre-LC3 punctate mask. Finally, an LC3 puncta mask was created by keeping the pre-puncta objects encompassed within the fish body mask. Morphological measurements were recorded from the two final masks. The LC3 punctate total area relative to body surface area was used as a parameter for quantification. Python and MetaXpress codes have been deposited on GitHub and are accessible at https://github.com/giulializzo/zebrafish_high_content_imaging.git.

The OCR in zebrafish larvae was measured using the Seahorse XF24 instrument (Seahorse Bioscience). Larvae were placed in a 24-well islet microplate (XF24 Islet Capture FluxPak no. 101174-100, Seahorse Bioscience), maintained with an islet capture screen and overlaid with 600 µl of egg water without air bubbles. Larvae were allowed to equilibrate for 10 min and maintained at 28.5 °C throughout the entire experiment. Respiration rates were determined every 5 min. Basal respiration was calculated as the average of the last three measurement points (from 40 to 52 min) before the injection of FCCP to a final concentration of 0.8 µM. Uncoupled respiration was determined by the maximum value observed after FCCP injection. Larvae that did not respond to FCCP and exhibited OCR values lower than basal respiration were excluded from the analysis. Rotenone (Sigma-Aldrich, R8875) and antimycin A (Sigma-Aldrich, A8764) were injected at concentrations of 1 µM and 1 µg l−1, respectively, to inhibit the electron transport chain, with residual OCR accounting for nonmitochondrial respiration.

Total proteins were extracted from mouse tissues or from pools of 20 zebrafish larvae at 3 dpf, as described in the Supplementary Methods. For SDS–PAGE, lysates were diluted, mixed with NuPAGE LDS sample buffer and a sample reducing agent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NP0008 and NP0009), and heated at 70 °C for 10 min in heating blocks. Proteins (40 µg) were loaded onto precast NuPAGE Bis–Tris 1.0 mm Midi Protein Gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific, WG1402 and WBT01020), and electrophoresis was performed for 90 min at 130 V. Gels were incubated in 20% ethanol for 10 min and transferred onto PVDF membranes using the iBlot2 instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Membranes were rehydrated in TBS–Tween (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 28360) and blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS–Tween for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were incubated at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-AMPKα (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, 2532), rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-AMPKα (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, 2535), mouse monoclonal anti-CHOP (1:1,000, Abcam, Ab11419), rabbit polyclonal anti-CLPP (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, 14181), rabbit monoclonal anti-GAPDH (1:5,000, Abcam, Ab181602), mouse monoclonal anti-HSC70 (1:10,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-7298), rabbit polyclonal anti-HSP60 (1:1,000, Abcam, Ab46798), rabbit polyclonal anti-LC3 (1:1,000, Novus Biologicals, NB100-2220), rabbit monoclonal anti-Parkin (1:1,000, Abcam, Ab77924), rabbit polyclonal anti-PINK-1 (1:1,000, Novus Biologicals, BC100-494), mouse monoclonal anti-S6 ribosomal protein (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, 2317), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-S6 (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, 2211), mouse monoclonal anti-SQSTM1/P62 (1:1,000, Abnova, H00008878-M01), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ubiquitin (S65) (1:1,000, Boston Biochem, A110), rabbit polyclonal anti-VDAC-1 (1:1,000, Abcam, Ab15895), rabbit monoclonal anti-vinculin (1:5,000, Abcam, Ab219649) and total OXPHOS Blue Native WB Antibody Cocktail (1:1,000, Abcam, Ab110412). Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG H&L (HRP) secondary antibodies (1:10,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 31460 and 31430) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 32106).

To measure autophagy in Jurkat cells, we used the Guava LC3 antibody-based assay kit (Luminex, FCCH100171), following the manufacturer's instructions. The kit includes reagent A (an inhibitor of lysosomal activity), reagent B (a permeabilization solution) and an anti-LC3 antibody conjugated with FITC (clone 4E-12). Half of the replicates were incubated with reagent A for 30 min before the end of the treatment to block lysosomal degradation of LC3 vesicles, thereby measuring autophagic flux. Cells were then transferred to a 96-well V-bottom plate, permeabilized with reagent B to remove the cytoplasmic form of LC3 (LC3-I) and incubated with the FITC-conjugated LC3 antibody. Samples were then analyzed using a Becton Dickinson LSR Fortessa SORP analyzer. Offline analyses were performed using FCS Express Software (De Novo Software), with results expressed as the median fluorescence intensity in the FITC channel.

MMP and mitochondrial superoxide measurements in Jurkat cells were conducted using flow cytometry. For the MMP, JC-10 was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Enzo Life Sciences, ENZ-52305). Cells were treated with thymol, carvacrol or FCCP for 30 min, and JC-10 staining was added 15 min before analysis. For mitochondrial superoxide measurements, Jurkat cells were incubated with MitoSOX Red (5 µM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, M36008) for 20 min before acquisition. Samples were analyzed using a Becton Dickinson LSR Fortessa SORP flow cytometry analyzer. Offline analyses were performed using FCS Express Software (De Novo Software). The gating strategy is described in the Supplementary Methods.

In MAFs, the MMP was assessed by TMRM and MitoTracker costaining. Thymol or carvacrol (100 μM) was added to the medium and left for 24 h. Untreated cells received an equal volume of DMSO. Oligomycin (1 nM) was used to prevent proton efflux and depolarization. For MMP measurement, cells were grown in a 24-well glass-bottom plate in the presence of conditioned medium for 24 h, then costained with TMRM (20 nM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, T668) and MitoTracker Deep Red (100 nM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, M22426). Following a 30-min incubation in the dark at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with dye-free conditioned medium. TMRM and MitoTracker signals were analyzed using a TCS SP8 confocal microscope (Leica Biosystems), as described in the Supplementary Methods.

After dissection, liver tissue was rapidly cut into small pieces with scissors and placed in ice-cold medium A (0.32 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris–HCl, 1 mM EDTA; pH adjusted to 7.4). The pieces were transferred into a 5-ml Dounce homogenizer (glass–Teflon) at a ratio of 5 ml of medium A per 1 g of tissue. After four to six strokes at 600 rpm on ice, the suspension was transferred into a 15-ml Falcon tube and centrifuged at 1,000g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred into 2-ml microtubes and centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet containing mitochondria was resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold medium A. The mitochondrial protein concentration was then determined using the BCA method (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23225).

The OCR in mitochondria isolated from mouse livers was measured using high-resolution respirometry (OROBOROS Oxygraph-2k, Oroboros Instruments). For respirometry analysis, 150 µg of crude mitochondrial extract was added to modified MiR05 buffer (110 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl2, 20 mM taurine, 10 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM HEPES and 0.1% BSA essentially fatty acid free) in a 2-ml chamber at 37 °C. Respiration in isolated mitochondria was determined using SUIT (substrate–uncoupler–inhibitor titration) protocols, with modifications. Pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich, P2256, 5 mM), glutamate (Sigma-Aldrich, G1626, 10 mM) and malate (Sigma-Aldrich, M1000, 2 mM) were used as substrates for inducing complex I respiration in the presence of ADP (Sigma-Aldrich, A5285, 1 mM). A 2-µl volume of thymol solution (50 mM thymol in ethanol) was repeatedly injected to reach incremental concentrations of thymol in the respirometry chamber. The second (control) chamber was injected with the same volume of carrier (ethanol) alone. After a sufficient number of titration steps, respiration was halted by the addition of the complex I inhibitor rotenone (Sigma-Aldrich, R8875, 0.5 µM). Values obtained were normalized to the baseline respiration measured in the control chamber.

Total RNA was extracted as described in the Supplementary Methods. Total RNA (75 ng; 8.9 < RNA quality number < 10) was used to generate the libraries using the QuantSeq 3′ mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit FWD for Illumina (Lexogen, 015.384) following 20 cycles of PCR amplification. Libraries were quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen kit (Invitrogen, Q33140) on a FilterMax F3. The size pattern was assessed using the Fragment Analyzer 96 system with the High Sensitivity NGS Fragment Analysis Kit (Agilent Technologies, DNF-474-0500). Libraries were pooled at an equimolar ratio at a concentration of 40 nM, and sequencing was performed by loading a concentration of 650 pM with a P3 50 kit for 65 cycles on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 platform (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Body composition was measured using nuclear magnetic resonance with the Minispec device (Bruker). Lean body mass and body fat were recorded and normalized to total body weight. OGTT was performed on mice that had been fasted for 6 h. Tail vein glucose levels were measured using a Contour glucometer (Ascensia Diabetes Care) immediately before glucose administration and at 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after glucose administration (1 g glucose per kg body weight). Plasma insulin levels before glucose administration and at 15, 30 and 60 min after glucose administration during the OGTT procedure were quantified from heparinized plasma samples using an ultrasensitive ELISA kit (Crystal Chem, 90080).

The Triglyceride-Glo Assay kit (Promega, J3160) was used to measure triglyceride levels in mouse liver homogenates. Homogenates were prepared from 40 mg of liver tissue in 1 ml ice-cold PBS, using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen) at a frequency of 30 oscillations per second for 2 min. The homogenates were subsequently centrifuged at 1,000g at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was used for the triglyceride assay according to the manufacturer's instructions.

For experiments on plates, C. elegans strains were cultured at 20 °C on nematode growth medium (NGM) agar plates seeded with the E. coli strain OP50. Thymol and carvacrol were mixed into the agar medium before the plates were poured. DMSO was used as a control (maximum concentration of 0.4% for 100 µM). Fresh plates were prepared weekly, and animals were transferred to freshly seeded plates daily after reaching the L4 stage.

For pharmacological treatment on chips, worms were exposed to carvacrol, thymol or 1% DMSO in liquid NGM medium with heat-killed E. coli OP50 (20 mg ml−1). Compounds were dissolved in DMSO and prepared at a 2× concentration in liquid NGM. On the day of treatment, the 2× stock was diluted to the final concentration with liquid NGM containing heat-killed E. coli OP50. Once the animals reached the L4 stage, they were loaded into microfluidic chips (Infinity Chips, NemaLife) and maintained on a diet of heat-killed E. coli OP50 for 24 h. On day 1 of adulthood, worms were treated with the appropriate compound or 1% DMSO. Medium exchange was performed daily to maintain consistent exposure until the end of the assays.

The number of autophagosomes was assessed in the DA2123 C. elegans strain that expresses GFP::LGG-1, with autophagosomes detected as GFP+ puncta. Animals were collected, washed to remove bacteria and anesthetized using metamizole at a final concentration of 20 mM. The animals were then placed on slides and observed under the 40× lens of a Leica DM5500 upright microscope. Mitophagy was measured using a strain that expresses the mtRosella biosensor in the mitochondria of body wall muscle cells. Mitophagy was calculated as the ratio of pH-insensitive DsRed to pH-sensitive GFP, as previously described77.

For the healthspan assay, one 90-s video per chip was recorded for each time point. The activity score analysis involved determining the fraction of pixels (representing a worm within a bounding box) that changed over 30 s. Highly active animals that completely moved their bodies out of the bounding box were assigned a score of 1, whereas completely inactive animals received a score of 0. Animals with intermediate scores still had a portion of their bodies remaining in the bounding box after 30 s. For thermotolerance assays, L4 animals and C. elegans carrying deletions of daf-16, pink-1, aak-2 and skin-1 were loaded into microfluidic chips at 20 °C with NGM. On day 1 of adulthood, the medium was exchanged with NGM containing the appropriate treatment, and the animals were allowed to grow until day 3 of adulthood. Subsequently, the animals were exposed to a 37 °C heat shock for 4 h, followed by recovery and scoring for the number of alive animals in the chips.

The mean speed and distance crawled by C. elegans on the plate were measured on day 10 of adulthood using the Movement Tracker software, as previously described78. Lifespan tests were performed at 20 °C, and the worms were monitored daily for survival. Worms were considered to have died if they failed to respond to gentle prodding with a platinum wire. Lifespan data were recorded until all the worms had died. Lifespan metrics were calculated and analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method.

RW1596 animals were grown on NGM plates seeded with E. coli OP50 bacteria and containing either thymol, carvacrol or vehicle. The animals were maintained on these plates until day 10 of adulthood, after which they were collected, washed to remove bacteria and anesthetized with tetramisole at a final concentration of 20 mM. They were then placed on slides and observed under the 40× lens of a Leica DM5500 upright microscope.

At least 200 muscle cells were counted for each condition. Muscle cells containing broken myofibrils or myofibrils with abnormal orientation were classified as damaged, while those with intact myofibrils showing normal, parallel orientation were classified as normal. Finally, the percentage of damaged myofibers relative to the total number of myofibers was calculated.

DNA extraction was performed on 100 mg of muscle tissue using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit, following the manufacturer's recommendations. DNA was quantified using DropSense technology (Unchained Labs). Bisulfite conversion was performed on 500 ng of DNA using the Zymo EZ DNA methylation kit, following the manufacturer's instructions. Converted DNA (200 ng) was used to proceed with the Infinium HD Methylation Assay Protocol, following the manufacturer's recommendations. DNA methylation data were generated using custom arrays (HorvathMammalMethyl40, Illumina) and scanned on an iScan reader (Illumina). Biological age was quantified based on a pan-tissue epigenetic clock algorithm52.

Endurance was evaluated using a treadmill apparatus (Ugo Basile) with a gradually accelerating protocol, starting at 5 rpm for 2 min and increasing to 50 m s−1 over 2,700 s. The test was terminated by exhaustion, defined as ten falls per minute in the motivational air puff.

Weakness was assessed by measuring forelimb grip strength using a grip strength meter (Ugo Basile). Mice grasped the grid with their forelimbs and were gently pulled away by holding the base of their tails. Measurements were recorded in triplicate, and the average was used for the analysis.

The Y maze task was used to measure spontaneous alternation behavior. Mice were introduced to the center of the maze and allowed to explore the three arms for 6 min. The number of triads was recorded to calculate the percentage of alternation. An entry was defined when all four limbs were within an arm.

A rotarod apparatus (Ugo Basile) was used to assess coordination skills. After two acclimation sessions, the apparatus was set to a starting velocity of 4 rpm and an acceleration rate of 20 rpm per minute. Mice underwent three trial sessions at least 20 min apart, and the latency to fall was recorded for each mouse.

For histochemical analysis, tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen-precooled isopentane. The tibialis anterior muscle was cut into 12-μm sections at −25 °C, and the sections were thaw-mounted on slides. The slides were dried at room temperature and stained using a monoclonal anti-laminin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, L9393) diluted 1:100 and a goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor 405) secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A48254) diluted 1:500 for detection. Livers were cryodissected at 8 µm and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde. The ORO stock stain was prepared by dissolving 0.5 g of ORO (Sigma-Aldrich, O0625) in 100 ml of isopropanol. The working solution was prepared by diluting 30 ml of the stock with 20 ml of distilled water. Liver tissues were cut into 2-mm-thick slices, fixed in formalin, paraffinized and hydrated. After deparaffinization and rehydration with xylene and ethanol, the slides were stained with ORO working solution for 15 min, rinsed with 60% isopropanol and lightly stained with hematoxylin for 4 min. After rinsing with distilled water, the slides were mounted. Lipid droplets were stained red and assessed using an Olympus VS120 slide scanner. The size of lipid droplets per field was calculated based on the average size of lipid droplets in ten fields from each mouse liver slide, using the multipoint function of ImageJ.

Raw counts were mapped to the mouse reference genome (GRCm38-101) using STAR (v.2.5.3) and counted using HTSeq-count (v.0.6.1). Data were checked for quality, and no outliers were detected in the principal component analysis. A filter was applied to select only genes with a minimum of 30 reads in at least six samples (corresponding to a threshold of 3.809 on the count per million values), and nonannotated genes were discarded. A total of 10,697 features were retained using these filtering criteria. To account for composition bias between libraries, we applied TMM (trimmed mean of M-value) normalization79. Differential expression analysis between groups was performed using edgeR (v.4.2.1), which estimates gene-wise negative binomial dispersions by calculating the adjusted profile log-likelihood for each gene and maximizing it using the weighted likelihood empirical Bayes method80. A quasi-likelihood negative binomial generalized log-linear model was fitted to the count data, and a gene-wise empirical Bayes quasi-likelihood F test was conducted for each comparison. Resulting P values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg correction method.

Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the Camera function in the edgeR package81, which conducts a competitive test to assess whether the genes in the set are highly ranked in terms of differential expression relative to genes not in the set, while accounting for intergene correlation. Camera was applied to the hallmark pathways from the mouse MSigDB82. The Fry algorithm from edgeR was applied to assess the enrichment of a preselected list of pathways. Fry is a fast approximation of a rotation gene set test that performs self-contained gene set tests to assess whether any of the genes in the set are differentially expressed83. P values are obtained through simulation, followed by adjustment for multiple testing.

For each coverslip containing mito-QC fibroblasts or tissues, ten random images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope with a 63× oil immersion objective. Images were processed with ImageJ using a custom macro, as described in the Supplementary Methods.

GraphPad Prism software version 9.0 (GraphPad Software) was used to perform all statistical analyses as indicated in the main text and figure legends, except for the gene expression and pathway analyses. Bar graphs show means ± s.e.m. Box plot elements show the following data: median (center line), upper and lower quartiles (box limits), minimum and maximum values (whiskers), and points. Differences between two groups were assessed using Student's t test. Differences among more than two groups were assessed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The interaction between two factors was tested using a two-way ANOVA. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. Survival analysis in zebrafish and worms was performed using the Kaplan–Meier method, and pairwise comparisons were conducted using the log-rank test. For high-content imaging, zebrafish larvae that were displaced during acquisition, resulting in undetectable LC3-positive puncta, were excluded from the analysis. No randomization method was used in zebrafish, cell or worm experiments. Mice were randomized using simple randomization based on body weight within the experimental groups. All phenotyping experiments in mice were conducted with the experimenters blinded to the treatment, and data analyses were performed without knowledge of the experimental conditions. Chronic mouse interventions were performed once, but they followed blinding and randomization to ensure reproducibility. For mouse studies, animals that showed weight loss greater than 20%, those found dead in their cages, and those displaying signs of infection and inflammation in their wounds were killed and excluded from the study.

For the worm and zebrafish experiments, the researchers performing the assays were blinded to the treatment. Histopathology, confocal imaging and image analysis were performed in a blinded manner. For all other experiments, blinding was not formally conducted. For short-term thymol supplementation studies in mice, the sample size was determined based on previous publications to detect significant changes in mitophagy or autophagy induction, as measured by the mitophagy index or the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, respectively38,84. For the metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease model, the sample size was similar to that reported in other studies85. For the SAMP8 study, treadmill performance exhibited the greatest variability among all the parameters considered. Based on pilot studies, a 20% decline in motor performance was expected between 8 and 11 months of age. With a study power (β) set at 0.80, an α error of 0.05, and assumptions of a halt in motor decline from the start of treatment and a 25% mortality rate, a sample size of 15 animals per group was deemed necessary. SAMP8 mice that died before the end of the experiment were excluded from subsequent analyses. For C. elegans studies, sample sizes were determined based on previous publications42,86. For all representative images showing cells, zebrafish or C. elegans, experiments were repeated a minimum of three times independently and checked to ensure the reproducibility of the results. The graphics used in the schemata throughout the paper were created using BioRender.com.

When children are exposed to acetaminophen -- also known by the brand name Tylenol or as paracetamol -- during pregnancy, they may be more likely to develop neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including autism and ADHD, according to a new study.

The study was published recently in BMC Environmental Health. Andrea Baccarelli, dean of the faculty at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and professor of environmental health, was senior author. The study was led by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and also included co-authors from other institutions.

The researchers analyzed results from 46 previous studies worldwide that investigated the potential link between prenatal acetaminophen use and subsequent NDDs in children. The researchers used the Navigation Guide Systematic Review methodology -- a gold-standard framework for synthesizing and evaluating environmental health data -- which enabled them to conduct a rigorous, comprehensive analysis that supported evidence of an association between acetaminophen exposure during pregnancy and increased incidence of NDDs.

The researchers noted that while steps should be taken to limit acetaminophen use, the drug is important for treating pain and fever during pregnancy, which can also harm the developing fetus. High fever can raise the risk of neural tube defects and preterm birth. "We recommend judicious acetaminophen use -- lowest effective dose, shortest duration -- under medical guidance, tailored to individual risk-benefit assessments, rather than a broad limitation," they wrote.

In late September, the Food and Drug Administration announced it would issue a letter to clinicians urging them to be cautious about the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy. Baccarelli said he had discussed his study with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the weeks leading up to that announcement and provided the White House team with an statement noting his research found "evidence of an association" between prenatal exposure to acetaminophen and neurodevelopmental disorders. "That association is strongest when acetaminophen is taken for four weeks or longer," Baccarelli said.

The statement continued: "Further research is needed to confirm the association and determine causality, but based on existing evidence, I believe that caution about acetaminophen use during pregnancy -- especially heavy or prolonged use -- is warranted."

Baccarelli noted in the "competing interests" section of the research paper that he has served as an expert witness for plaintiffs in a case involving potential links between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders.

The study was conducted in collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles; University of Massachusetts Lowell; and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

Funding for this study was provided by the National Cancer Institute (U54CA267776), the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (R35ES031688), and the National Institute on Aging (U01AG088684).

For decades, Silicon Valley has valorized the college dropout. Founders like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg left school early to build companies and became billionaires. 

That ethos was later institutionalized through initiatives like the Thiel Fellowship, which famously pays promising students $100,000 to leave college and start companies.

For many years, the famed accelerator Y Combinator also quietly reinforced that culture. While it never explicitly required students to drop out, many of its most successful alumni, including Dropbox's Drew Houston, Reddit's Steve Huffman, and Stripe's John and Patrick Collison, joined the program young and left school behind to build their companies.

Now, YC is changing that narrative.

The accelerator has introduced a new application track called Early Decision, designed for students who want to start companies but don't want to drop out. The program allows them to apply while still in school, get accepted and funded immediately, and defer their participation in YC until after they graduate. For example, a student applying in Fall 2025 could graduate in Spring 2026, then participate in YC's Summer 2026 batch.

“It's designed for graduating seniors who want to do a startup but also want to finish school first,” said YC managing partner Jared Friedman in the launch video. 

Friedman added that the idea for Early Decision came from conversations with students. “Between AI Startup School last summer and the more than 20 university trips we've done over the past year, we've had a lot of opportunities to do that. One of YC's most common pieces of advice is to ‘talk to your users,' and we follow it ourselves,” he told TechCrunch over email. 

In Silicon Valley culture, dropping out has been almost a rite of passage for aspiring founders Programs like the Thiel Fellowship have turned it into a movement (though it's worth noting that Peter Thiel himself did not drop out but earned both undergraduate and law degrees from Stanford). 

It's why YC's announcement is a meaningful break from that mythos that leaving school early is the optimal, or only, path to startup success. The timing is also significant, coming at a time when more young people are questioning both the cost of college and the tradeoffs of staying in school. 

The new program also reflects a growing maturity in how YC thinks about long-term founder outcomes.

The accelerator has long been a magnet for college-aged builders. Founders of Loom, Instacart, Rappi, and Brex were in their teens or early twenties when they joined the program. But the decision to drop out was often implicit: do the program now or miss the opportunity.

Early Decision removes that pressure, offering a middle ground between academic completion and chasing entrepreneurship. The move could broaden YC's applicant pool to include more cautious, deliberate student founders who are committed to startup life but unwilling to sacrifice education to get there.

Introducing Early Decision.For students who want to do a startup but also want to finish school first. Apply now, get funded the moment you're accepted, and do YC after you graduate.https://t.co/YQbvZj0AJm pic.twitter.com/AN1iMm9k9j

In its announcement, YC highlights Sneha Sivakumar and Anushka Nijhawan, the co-founders of Spur, as a success story from this approach. Spur builds AI-powered quality-assurance testing tools, and the duo applied to YC through Early Decision in Fall 2023 while still in school. They graduated in May 2024, joined the Summer 2024 YC batch and have since raised $4.5 million. 

YC notes that the program is open to both graduating students and those earlier in their academic journey. It's a bet that some of the best founders of the next decade won't need to choose between college and startups. They'll do both. 

The move also helps YC secure talent early in an increasingly competitive accelerator and seed funding landscape, giving students an option that competes with other programs like Thiel Fellowship, Neo Scholars, Founders Inc, as well as Big Tech internships and grad school pipelines.

An Indian court has dismissed an attempt by Elon Musk's X to challenge the Indian government's content takedown orders, ruling that the social media platform, as a foreign company, does not have a constitutional right to free speech under Indian law.

The Karnataka High Court ruled Wednesday in favor of the Indian government's use of a centralized online portal to issue content takedown orders, determining that foreign platforms cannot invoke free speech protections under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution. The court said this constitutional of free expression applies only to Indian citizens. The decision marks a significant moment in India's increasingly assertive approach to regulating global tech companies.

X filed the case in March, challenging a series of Indian government orders directing the platform to block certain accounts and posts, including content critical of official policies. At the heart of the dispute was the use of “Sahyog” — a government portal launched in October that allows authorities to directly order social media companies to remove content. Sahyog means “assistance” in Hindi. X called it a “censorship portal” and argued the process lacked transparency and violated principles of free expression.

“Article 19 of the Constitution of India, noble in its spirit and luminous in its promise, remains, nevertheless, a Charter of Rights conferred upon citizens only. The petitioner who seeks sanctuary under its canopy must be a citizen of the nation, failing which the protective embrace of Article 19 cannot be invoked,” senior judge M Nagaprasanna said in his ruling, which was also livestreamed, as the court rejected X's petition.

The ruling comes as Musk expands his footprint in India beyond X, having recently launched Tesla operations and secured final regulatory approval for his satellite internet service Starlink. The South Asian nation is a strategic bet for the billionaire, boasting the world's second-largest internet user base after China and a government committed to achieving 30% electric vehicle adoption by 2030.

X did not respond to a request for comments. A legal representative for X in India was not immediately available to comment on the ruling.

Kazim Rizvi, Founding Director of The Dialogue, a New Delhi-based think tank, said the ruling may improve coordination between the government and platforms, but cautioned that “due diligence” should not become a blanket obligation to comply — especially when takedowns occur via a portal, rather than through the structured safeguards of Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000. (Section 69A is India's main law governing how the government can order content blocking, and it includes procedural protections.)

“To avoid unintended legal effects, the portal should operate strictly as a coordination and collection layer — a secure intake and routing point for requests, and any binding action should originate from a competent authority under the IT Act/Rules,” he told TechCrunch.

Content takedown orders have increased in India over the past few years as more people come online. Several instances of content removal across platforms — including X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram — occurred during the nationwide farmers' protests in 2020–2021. These protests saw widespread social media activity that the government sought to control.

The federal government introduced the Sahyog portal last year to expedite the removal of unlawful content from social media, arguing that it would streamline enforcement. Companies, including Microsoft, Google, Meta, ShareChat, and LinkedIn, have already integrated the portal to remove content after receiving notices through an automated process triggered by the federal government or its agencies.

In February 2024, X stated that, although it disagreed with the orders, it withheld certain accounts in response to executive directives from the Indian government. Noncompliance, the company noted, could have exposed it to “potential penalties including significant fines and imprisonment.”

A legal expert, who works closely with tech companies and the Indian government on policy matters and requested anonymity due to the sensitive nature of their work, told TechCrunch that Wednesday's ruling was significant. The decision shows that courts are increasingly viewing internet regulation and tech policy through a policy lens — not just a legal one, they said.

Musk, who has called himself a “free speech absolutist,” has not commented on the lawsuit and ruling, though he previously raised concerns about Indian content regulation laws.

“The rules in India for what can appear on social media are quite strict, and we can't go beyond the laws of a country,” Musk said in a 2023 interview with the BBC.

X can still appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. However, some legal experts argue that it is unclear whether the company would receive favorable treatment, as the top court is likely to follow the same line of reasoning as the Karnataka High Court.

“The ruling didn't address whether the government should even have the power to use a portal for ordering content takedowns,” said a tech policy expert, who requested not to be named due to their close ties with the Indian government and major tech firms.

The court will release the order's copy on Thursday, the judge said.

The Trump administration last Friday announced a new $100,000 annual levy on H-1B visas, which allow 85,000 skilled foreign workers to enter the U.S. each year. The fee applies to companies hiring these workers, primarily in tech.

Veteran venture capitalist Michael Moritz isn't having it. In a new, scathing Financial Times op-ed, the former Sequoia Capital honcho compares the White House to Tony Soprano's pork store, calling the move another “brutish extortion scheme.”

Moritz argues that Trump fundamentally misunderstands why tech companies hire foreign workers, saying it's about skills and filling labor shortages, not replacing Americans or cutting costs. The policy will backfire, he warns, by pushing companies to relocate work to Istanbul, Warsaw, or Bangalore instead of keeping it stateside.

“Engineers with undergraduate degrees from the better eastern Europe, Turkish and Indian universities are every bit as well qualified as their American counterparts,” Moritz writes.

Instead of restricting H-1B visas, Moritz suggests doubling or tripling them, or automatically granting citizenship to foreign nationals earning STEM PhDs from top U.S. universities. He points to foreign-born CEOs like Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Google's Sundar Pichai as examples of H-1B program success. (Elon Musk and Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger are two others.)

Moritz himself received the precursor visa to the H-1B in 1979, and ever since, writes the billionaire, “I have felt grateful to the country that welcomed me.”

Qualcomm is back for round two of its push into Windows PCs. At its Snapdragon Summit in Maui, Hawaii, the company revealed its Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Extreme. These chips will serve as the high-end offerings in Qualcomm's second generation of Arm-based chips for laptops and other PC form factors.

The Elite Extreme is a new tier above the standard Elite, which was the top chip in the original X-series line. The Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme will offer up to 18 cores, and Qualcomm claims it's the first Arm chip to hit 5 GHz (on up to two cores).

The company says its Elite chips will be made on a 3-nanometer process node. The Snapdragon X2 Elite uses a mix of Qualcomm Oryon Prime cores and what it calls Performance CPU cores. This is seemingly a standard Performance/Efficiency layout with different names. At normalized power, Qualcomm says it offers up to 75% more performance than its competitors. In multitasking, it claims the new chips will offer up to 31% faster performance at a normalized ISO power, while needing 43% less power than last-gen chips. We don't yet have benchmarks to share, and Qualcomm didn't note the exact TDPs for these chips.

 




The Elite Extreme has higher clock speeds in both single- and dual-core boost and multi-core max than the other two Snapdragon X2 Elite variants. The Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme is model X2E-96-100, while the standard Elites are X2E-88-100 and X2E-80-100. The Extreme and the 88-100 each have 18 cores, while the 80-100 has 12 cores.

There's also a new Qualcomm Adreno GPU, which the company says brings a 2.3x increase in performance per watt and power efficiency compared to the last generation. The new 80 TOPS NPU looks to be the fastest in a laptop (with INT8 math), with 78% more TOPS than the previous generation, 45 TOPS NPU. In its press release, Qualcomm writes that this NPU "is designed to handle Copilot+ and concurrent AI experiences." (Copilot+ doesn't include actual Copilot, the assistant that runs largely in the cloud.)

The X2 Elite chip supports Qualcomm's x75 5G modem-RG system, with up to 10 Gbps peak downloads. It also works with Qualcomm FastConnect 7800 for Wi-FI 7/6/6E and Bluetooth 5.4 LE. Qualcomm's new Guardian is an out-of-band management feature for business-focused remote oversight, akin to Intel's vPro.

Qualcomm says that it expects systems with the X2 Elite to ship in the first half of 2026. That may mean we'll see a device or two at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, before launch. Notably, Qualcomm's images and a sizzle reel both suggest that the X2 Elite will appear in both laptops and mini PCs.

It's been over a year since the initial batch of Snapdragon X Elite chips were announced. Subsequently, a full lineup including the X Plus (in both 10-core and 8-core variants) and a standard Snapdragon X chip were released. The top-end chips appeared in designs from major manufacturers, including Microsoft, Samsung, Dell, HP, Asus, Lenovo, and Acer.

The initial chips showed off their efficiency through long battery life, and we hope to see the X2 SoCs build on that. They didn't, however, work with some applications (namely games) and we want to see better emulation support there. Windows on Arm, however, didn't exactly take over the market, so we'll see what the new chips bring to the table.

Qualcomm is announcing these chips pretty early. The Snapdragon Summit comes ahead of Apple's next major release (Apple is Qualcomm's biggest rival in Arm-based systems), which is rumored to be early next year. And of course, by the time many X2 devices make it to market in the first half of 2026, AMD and Intel may also have next-gen x86 chips ready to compete.

Next year is shaping up to be an eventful one for those looking to buy a new laptop, which should be good for consumers and the industry as a whole. After a fairly quiet 2025 on the mobile front, it'll also be nice to have some fresh silicon to test.

Qualcomm has announced its next generation of PC processors: the Snapdragon X2. It might not sound very exciting, but these chips continue to bring Windows laptops up to par with Apple Silicon–powered MacBooks.

The company took the PC world by storm last year with its Snapdragon X chips, breaking the long-held duopoly of Intel and AMD powering most Windows laptops. Nearly every major laptop manufacturer was on board, launching a bevy of Qualcomm-powered laptops. It was a shake-up that the Windows ecosystem needed to better compete with Apple, which began designing its own chips in 2020 with the M1 MacBook Air—a move that helped cement MacBooks as some of the best laptops around.

Qualcomm rode out its surprising success throughout 2025, and finally it's time for a sequel. The first two chips in the lineup, announced at its annual Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii, are the X2 Elite and X2 Elite Extreme, the latter of which is a new configuration in the Snapdragon X series, with the clock speed cranked up to 5 GHz. (The company paid for a portion of my travel expenses to attend the Snapdragon Summit.)

The new processors employ the third-gen Oryon CPU with up to 18 cores onboard, six more than their predecessors. Qualcomm claims that the X2 Elite Extreme gets up to 39 percent faster peak single-core performance and 50 percent multicore performance over the previous generation.

Emphasizing efficiency, Qualcomm also says the Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme has “up to 75 percent faster CPU performance than competition at ISO power,” referring to comparing two chips when they're consuming the same amount of power. As Qualcomm later specified, this comparison was with the beefy Intel Core Ultra 9 285H, requiring 144 percent more power to reach its peak performance than the Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme. Other impressive-sounding performance claims the company made include up to 49 percent faster Microsoft 365 performance (as tested in Procyon Office) and up to twice as fast file compression against the Intel Core Ultra 9 288V.

Energy efficiency was the primary advantage the initial Snapdragon X-powered laptops had over laptops that used Intel or AMD. ARM-powered processors, like those in smartphones and MacBooks, tend to be highly efficient, leading to longer battery life and better performance at lower power levels. Qualcomm says it's continuing this lead, with its new CPU requiring up to 43 percent less power versus the previous generation, across both the X2 Elite and Elite Extreme.

Perhaps the most exciting part of the chip is the graphics performance: The Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Extreme both use a new Adreno GPU architecture. Qualcomm says power efficiency has improved by 2.3X, so hopefully that means these laptops can scale up performance when it's needed, in games or creative applications. Qualcomm says gaming will take a big step forward in this next generation. Qualcomm showed a chart with 2.2X faster frame rates in Hitman World of Assassination and 2.1X faster in Black Myth Wukong. Of course, these Qualcomm laptops continue to rely exclusively on integrated graphics, meaning the discrete GPUs in dedicated gaming laptops are still on another level of performance. Snapdragon X2 chips will also support higher refresh rate screens, now up to 144 Hz and up to three external 5K monitors.

Lastly, the company claims there's a much more powerful neural processing unit (NPU) with 80 TOPS (trillions of operations per second) of on-device AI processing performance. The Snapdragon X set the initial bar with 50 TOPS, which Apple, Intel, and AMD then had to match in their next chips. We've yet to see the explosion of on-device AI processing be relevant for the average person, but hopefully, more performance will provide an incentive for developers to build more unique AI experiences that can utilize the NPU.

Qualcomm still boasts “multi-day” battery life on these new chips, though performance was the priority in the company's product presentation. This is a change from the original marketing around the first-generation Snapdragon X chips, which centered battery life as its primary selling point. At a later meeting, Kedar Kondap, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Qualcomm Compute and Gaming, told me that Snapdragon X2 laptops would maintain its position of leadership in battery life. Although exact estimates or figures weren't given, Kondap stated that the greater efficiency of the third-gen Oryon CPU would lead to even longer battery life than its predecessor.

As always, it helps to go first. These second-generation PC chips have been announced months ahead of devices from competitors, which may not arrive until the first quarter of 2026, making it easier to compare with previous-gen chips. Intel is expected to launch its highly anticipated A18 chips (also known as Panther Lake) later this year, and Nvidia's $5 billion investment in Intel could change everything in the world of PCs. Apple is also expected to debut an M5 chip next month.

Alongside new PC chips, Qualcomm also detailed its recently announced mobile chips, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. These were officially unveiled last week, but at the company's Snapdragon Summit conference, it shared new details on how these chips will perform.

Barely a week has gone by since Apple's A19-powered iPhones hit the market, but Qualcomm is already claiming that its Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is the “fastest mobile CPU in the world,” with a record clock speed of 4.6 GHz (Apple's A19 Pro has a clock speed of 4.26 GHz). Like the PC chips, graphics and AI processing have the largest leaps in performance, with a purported 23 percent faster GPU and 37 percent faster NPU. Some slightly faster single-core performance in your next phone might not be noticeable, but the significantly faster GPU could have a bigger impact on mobile gaming.

The other significant new feature on these mobile chips is the embrace of a new video codec called Advanced Professional Video, or APV. This is a “near-lossless” codec, created in partnership with Samsung, that's meant to compete with Apple's ProRes format and use less storage than current options.

Qualcomm says new phones powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 will launch "in the coming days,” with entries from Xiaomi, OnePlus, Samsung, Honor, and Xiaomi. Qualcomm also briefly announced the base Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 but didn't offer many details about it.

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon.

During the Snapdragon Summit keynote, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon drew the biggest applause with the mention of 6G as the future connectivity standard, replacing 5G, enabling a more pervasive AI future. “6G is designed to be the connection between the cloud and edge devices,” he said.

What is 6G? In addition to increasing network speeds, Amon says, it will be a “network that is intelligent to have perception in sensor data.” Amon implies that another level of connectivity is needed for a world where AI needs to process sensor data at the edge, whether that's from your phone or a pair of smart glasses, and then be trained on that data from the real world around you. Amon says 6G will be all about “connecting the edge and the cloud, that will merge not only the physical and the digital, but also create all new experiences.”

Amon went on to predict when this change will start happening. "We are ready to have pre-commercial devices as early as 2028. And when we get that, we're going to have context-aware intelligence at scale—and it's going to happen everywhere.” It's early days for 6G—we'll likely hear more at CES and MWC 2026—but it's worth noting that 5G was similarly hyped up years before it became the standard it is today, and it has largely failed to live up to the grand claims.

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon and Google senior VP of devices Rick Osterloh.

At the end of the keynote, we also got another tease on the merger between Chrome OS and Android, which Google briefly mentioned earlier this year. Google senior vice president of Devices and Services, Rick Osterloh, got up on stage to chat shop with Amon.

“In the past, we've always had very different systems between what we're building on PCs and what we're building on smartphones,” Osterloh said. "We've embarked on a project to combine that. We're building together a common technical foundation on PCs and desktop computing systems.”

Osterloh mentioned Android by name, though he didn't mention Chrome OS, implying this new unified platform will still be Android at heart. “We're really excited about this, and I think this is another way Android is going to be able to serve everyone in every computing category.” Amon chimed in: “I've seen it. It's incredible. I think it delivers on the vision of convergence of mobile and PC.”

A new app offering to record your phone calls and pay you for the audio so it can sell the data to AI companies is, unbelievably, the No. 2 app in Apple's U.S. App Store's Social Networking section. 

The app, Neon Mobile, pitches itself as a moneymaking tool offering “hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year” for access to your audio conversations.

Neon's website says the company pays 30¢ per minute when you call other Neon users and up to $30 per day maximum for making calls to anyone else. The app also pays for referrals. The app first ranked No. 476 in the Social Networking category of the U.S. App Store on September 18 but jumped to No. 10 at the end of yesterday, according to data from app intelligence firm Appfigures.

On Wednesday, Neon was spotted in the No. 2 position on the iPhone's top free charts for social apps.

Neon also became the No. 7 top overall app or game earlier on Wednesday morning and became the No. 6 top app.

According to Neon's terms of service, the company's mobile app can capture users' inbound and outbound phone calls. However, Neon's marketing claims to only record your side of the call unless it's with another Neon user.

That data is being sold to “AI companies,” Neon's terms of service state, “for the purpose of developing, training, testing, and improving machine learning models, artificial intelligence tools and systems, and related technologies.”

The fact that such an app exists and is permitted on the app stores is an indication of how far AI has encroached into users' lives and areas once thought of as private. Its high ranking within the Apple App Store, meanwhile, is proof that there is now some subsection of the market seemingly willing to exchange their privacy for pennies, regardless of the larger cost to themselves or society.

Despite what Neon's privacy policy says, its terms include a very broad license to its user data, where Neon grants itself a:

…worldwide, exclusive, irrevocable, transferable, royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to sell, use, host, store, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform (including by means of a digital audio transmission), communicate to the public, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, create derivative works as authorized in these Terms, and distribute your Recordings, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels, in each instance whether now known or hereafter developed.

That leaves plenty of wiggle room for Neon to do more with users' data than it claims. 

The terms also include an extensive section on beta features, which have no warranty and may have all sorts of issues and bugs.

Though Neon's app raises many red flags, it may be technically legal. 

“Recording only one side of the phone call is aimed at avoiding wiretap laws,” Jennifer Daniels, a partner with the law firm Blank Rome‘s Privacy, Security & Data Protection Group, tells TechCrunch.

“Under [the] laws of many states, you have to have consent from both parties to a conversation in order to record it … It's an interesting approach,” says Daniels.

Peter Jackson, cybersecurity and privacy attorney at Greenberg Glusker, agreed — and tells TechCrunch that the language around “one-sided transcripts” sounds like it could be a backdoor way of saying that Neon records users' calls in their entirety but may just remove what the other party said from the final transcript.

In addition, the legal experts pointed to concerns about how anonymized the data may really be. 

Neon claims it removes users' names, emails, and phone numbers before selling data to AI companies. But the company doesn't say how AI partners or others it sells to could use that data. Voice data could be used to make fake calls that sound like they're coming from you, or AI companies could use your voice to make their own AI voices.

“Once your voice is over there, it can be used for fraud,” says Jackson. “Now this company has your phone number and essentially enough information — they have recordings of your voice, which could be used to create an impersonation of you and do all sorts of fraud.”

Even if the company itself is trustworthy, Neon doesn't disclose who its trusted partners are or what those entities are allowed to do with users' data further down the road. Neon is also subject to potential data breaches, as any company with valuable data may be.

In a brief test by TechCrunch, Neon did not offer any indication that it was recording the user's call, nor did it warn the call recipient. The app worked like any other voice-over-IP app, and the caller ID displayed the inbound phone number, as usual. (We'll leave it to security researchers to attempt to verify the app's other claims.)

Neon founder Alex Kiam didn't return a request for comment.

Kiam, who is identified only as “Alex” on the company website, operates Neon from a New York apartment, a business filing shows.

A LinkedIn post indicates Kiam raised money from Upfront Ventures a few months ago for his startup, but the investor didn't respond to an inquiry from TechCrunch as of the time of writing.

There was a time when companies looking to profit from data collection through mobile apps handled this type of thing on the sly. 

When it was revealed in 2019 that Facebook was paying teens to install an app that spies on them, it was a scandal. The following year, headlines buzzed again when it was discovered that app store analytics providers operated dozens of seemingly innocuous apps to collect usage data about the mobile app ecosystem. There are regular warnings to be wary of VPN apps, which often aren't as private as they claim. There are even government reports detailing how agencies regularly purchase personal data that's “commercially available” on the market.

Now AI agents regularly join meetings to take notes, and always-on AI devices are on the market. But at least in those cases, everyone is consenting to a recording, Daniels tells TechCrunch.

In light of this widespread usage and sale of personal data, there are likely now those cynical enough to think that if their data is being sold anyway, they may as well profit from it. 

Unfortunately, they may be sharing more information than they realize and putting others' privacy at risk when they do. 

“There is a tremendous desire on the part of, certainly, knowledge workers — and frankly, everybody — to make it as easy as possible to do your job,” says Jackson. “And some of these productivity tools do that at the expense of, obviously, your privacy, but also, increasingly, the privacy of those with whom you are interacting on a day-to-day basis.”

YouTube will finally allow you to hide the pop-up recommendations that appear at the end of videos, the company announced on Wednesday. Now when you see an end screen, you can tap a new “Hide” button in the top-right corner of the video player to hide the pop-ups from the current video you're watching.

Selecting this button will only hide end screens for the current video you're watching, not for all videos on the platform, the company notes. If you want to bring the end screen back, you can tap the Show button.

The decision to let users hide end screens is a welcome addition to the platform, especially since they can end up covering the last bit of a video and make it hard to see what's happening in some cases.

The company also announced that it's removing the Subscribe button that appears when you hover your cursor over a video's branded watermark. YouTube explains that it's doing so because there's already a Subscribe button directly below the video player.

YouTube says it's launching the new features in response to user feedback, as many people said they wanted the option to minimize distractions on videos and for it to be easier to focus on the content they're currently watching. 

As for creators, YouTube notes that they still have the option to add end screens to videos. The company expects these changes to have a minimal impact on creators' performance and view count on the platform. 

For instance, YouTube found in an experiment that giving users the option to hide end screens resulted in a less than 1.5% decrease in views from end screens. Plus, it found that less than ~0.05% of all Channel subscriptions come from the hover-to-subscribe functionality on the video watermark.

Few blockbuster franchises inspire as much debate and discourse as Star Wars, and it's also the rare series that invites not just fans and critics to speak out, but also the people who have starred in its shows and movies. John Boyega, who played Finn across the sequel trilogy, hasn't been shy about holding back, whether it's his opinions on “Reylo” or how the fandom treats Star Wars‘ Black characters, to name two recent topics.

And though The Rise of Skywalker hit theaters in 2019, it feels like people are still constantly asking Boyega to talk about Star Wars. The most recent example came at the recent Florida Supercon. The event was held back in July, but as Variety reports (via Popverse), his comments are now going widespread, likely because Boyega seemingly unloaded on how he would've approached the Lucasfilm sequel series a lot differently.

“If I was a producer on Star Wars from the beginning, you would have had a whole completely different thing … we're not getting rid of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, all these people. We're not doing that. The first thing we're going to do is fulfill their story, fulfill their legacy. We're going to make a good moment of handing on the baton,” he said during a Supercon panel.

He also noted, referring to a certain Force-powered final battle, “Luke Skywalker wouldn't be disappearing on a rock. Hell no. Standing there and he's, like, a projector? I would want to give those characters way more.”

He also had some ideas about how the new Star Wars characters should have approached their own Force powers. “Our new characters will not be OP'd [overpowered] in these movies. They won't just grab stuff and know what to do with it. No. You've got to struggle like every other character in this franchise. I'd do that.”

Interestingly, however, the sources Boyega said he would have drawn from don't exactly stay true to that.

“I'd look to the Old Republic stories and see what we can add to the continuation of that. I would definitely want to see Force Unleashed stories in there,” Boyega explained, calling out a video game that features overpowered characters—as well as one like The Force Unleashed that's specifically non-canon, which makes the rest of his statement even odder: “I would try to expand the Star Wars universe as much as possible while respecting the lore. If we're expanding the lore, we have to do it within the respective boundaries that stay true.”

Obviously Boyega is just spitballing here, responding to a fan question and sharing his own off-the-cuff thoughts. Even if we don't quite follow his logic, we love to see that he's still got so much passion for Star Wars. And while Han Solo and Luke Skywalker are definitely gone, we may yet see Finn again, if that Rey movie ever comes into being.

This partnership comes despite Beijing's directive to stop purchasing Nvidia's H20 and RTX Pro 6000D chips.

Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba announced that it's partnering with Nvidia to fuel its data center expansion across the globe and the introduction of new AI products. Reuters reports that the company is now prioritizing artificial intelligence as part of its core business, which will put it on par with the company's online retail and wholesale business that made it the tech giant it is today. The announcement seems to imply a direct contravention of Beijing's directive that bans its biggest tech companies from acquiring Nvidia chips, so it's unclear if this partnership includes the purchase of AI GPUs.According to Alibaba Cloud, the company's Platform for AI (PAI) will integrate the “full suite of the Nvidia Physical AI software stack," so it technically may not violate the order to buy homegrown AI processors. The company already reportedly has its AI chip that competes with Nvidia's own H20, and it has even created its own High Performance Network using Ethernet to replace Nvidia's interconnect technology.However, it seems that Alibaba is ready to work with Nvidia to create a cloud-based system design to advance AI capabilities in real-world applications. “The speed of AI industry development has far exceeded our expectations, and the industry's demand for AI infrastructure has also far exceeded our expectations,” said Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu during the annual Aspara Conference. Alibaba also unveiled plans to build data centers in Brazil, France, and the Netherlands in the coming year. It will also add more of the same in Mexico, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, and Dubai — also in the coming year. Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group SVP Dr. Feifei Li remarked that “AI is revolutionizing not only technology, but also the very foundation of how enterprises deliver business value and drive growth. Our strategic expansion of global infrastructure is designed to cater for the accelerating demand from forward-thinking customers.” But despite all these plans, the company did not mention whether it will use Nvidia's AI chips for these projects. This move to increase Alibaba's footprint abroad will help the company influence the development of AI technology across the globe. It might even be the start of what Jensen Huang has been warning about — that the limitation of the sales of Nvidia chips will allow its competitors to gain a foothold in the international market and reduce the U.S.'s competitive advantage. Of course, its software partnership with Alibaba helps ensure that Nvidia is still involved with this massive project — unless Washington, D.C. or Beijing steps in as part of their chip rivalry and stops the deal from moving forward.

Leasing Nvidia chips instead of buying them outright could help OpenAI build its 10 GW AI empire.

OpenAI is in advanced talks to lease high-performance GPUs from Nvidia, rather than purchase them outright, as part of its plan to build out custom AI data centers over the next several years. That's according to a report published September 23 by The Information, which cites multiple people familiar with negotiations between the two companies.

The proposed leasing deal, which is reportedly still under discussion and subject to change, would represent a shift in how AI infrastructure is financed. Instead of buying hardware upfront or renting it from cloud providers like Microsoft or Oracle, OpenAI would take possession of Nvidia's AI chips under a five-year lease, potentially reducing capital strain while offloading depreciation risk to the supplier. Sources close to the discussions say OpenAI estimates that the leasing arrangement could cut its total hardware costs by 10 to 15%, although the methodology behind that figure is unclear.

The talks are part of a broader $100 billion strategic partnership between OpenAI and Nvidia, announced on September 22. Under the agreement, OpenAI plans to deploy up to 10 GW of Nvidia-powered infrastructure, with Nvidia providing both financial backing and hardware expertise. Nvidia is also investing $10 billion in OpenAI for a roughly 2% equity stake at a $500 billion valuation.

According to The Information, Nvidia could consider setting up a dedicated financing vehicle to fund the leasing structure. That entity would borrow capital to purchase GPUs and networking hardware, using the chips themselves as collateral. OpenAI's lease payments would then service the loan over the duration of the five-year term.

OpenAI, despite its valuation and revenue potential, lacks the balance sheet to purchase hundreds of billions of dollars in hardware on its own. Its projected cash burn through 2029 is pegged at $115 billion, and previous estimates suggest OpenAI could spend $450 billion renting capacity through 2030. Direct leasing would give it more control over site selection, layout, and workload optimization, all while securing long-term access to Nvidia's next-generation accelerators.

The deal, if finalized, could have ripple effects far beyond OpenAI. A large-scale leasing model could alter how Nvidia allocates inventory, how quickly it phases in new architectures, and how competitors position their own AI silicon.

Ever since Denis Villeneuve was announced as the director of the next James Bond movie, there's been rampant speculation over just who might be stepping into the shoes left behind in Daniel Craig's explosive departure. But a new report suggests that for all of Amazon's quick movement once it got control of the franchise, it might be a good while longer until the search for the next 007 gets underway.

A new report by Deadline today suggests that Villeneuve won't begin the hunt for his new Bond in earnest until next year, once production is completed on his third (and most likely final) Dune film, Dune: Part Three, which began filming this past June. Although principal photography for Part Two was around five months, an end date for Part Three remains unknown (and it's perhaps likely that Villeneuve will want to focus on elements of post-production into 2026 before shifting priorities to Bond).

Although Deadline's report says that the search for the next face of the franchise hasn't truly begun yet, that doesn't mean that there aren't at least some guidelines that Villeneuve and Amazon are honing their search on. According to the trade, the studio is looking for a British man, relatively unknown, in their late 20s or early 30s (so alas, put aside your Toms Hardy, your Idrises Elba, and perhaps even your Toms Holland—and absolutely your Pierces Brosnan, whatever he says) by the time the film begins shooting some time in 2027.

Also intriguing to note in the report is the idea that the new film may potentially focus on Bond's career in the Royal Navy, depicting his time as a commander before he's tapped by MI6 and eventually earns his 00-agent status. Although the direction of Stephen Knight's script is still in the air as it's being written, that potential focus is interestingly timed. After the conclusion of Craig's era as Bond, a full-on reboot that envisions the character's rise to the elite wings of British spycraft makes sense, but it will also mean it comes fascinatingly timed with next year's 007 First Light.

A lot of the big draw of IO Interactive's splashy new video game take on Bond is that it will similarly chart the story of a young Bond—the youngest we've seen so far at 26, depending on the eventual age of Villeneuve and Amazon's pick—as he joins MI6 and rises through the ranks to 00-status. Obviously a video game and a new movie (that may not be out for a couple years after First Light‘s release) are very different things, but it'd be interesting to see if this new era of Bond starts out with two major projects that explore the early days of the legendary spy.

Either way, with the hunt for the next big screen Bond not happening quite so soon, and First Light not out until March 2026, it's going to be a while until we really see what's next for James.

If you missed IShowSpeed in Seattle, you're too slow.

The YouTube sensation live-streamed his way through the city on Tuesday, eating, posing with fans, playing tourist at Pike Place Market and much more.

With more than 44 million subscribers on YouTube and another 40 million followers on Instagram, the online personality has become a global sensation. He was recently named Rolling Stone's most influential creator, and Forbes profiled his meteoric rise last year.

Born Darren Jason Watkins Jr., the 20-year-old originally from Cincinnati streams his antics all over the world, and is currently on a 35-day, 25-state “Speed Does America Tour.”

His continuous stream from Seattle (below) featured a frenzied insider's view of Speed being mobbed at every stop by fans — mostly young guys — shouting his name and trying to get his attention for selfies. An entourage of camera operators and beefy security guards formed a buffer around his every move, instructing people to “make room!” and “back up!”

“How do you spell Seattle?” he shouted into his phone while posting a picture of himself posing in front of the famed Public Market neon. In the background, an Amazon driver perched in his delivery van could be seen trying to grab his own pic.

Speed caught and tossed a fish, of course, and made his way through the Market for a view of Puget Sound, and then on to the Post Alley Gum Wall.

“This is real?” he wondered as people shouted “don't touch it!” Speed was handed a piece of gum to chew and when he leaped to place it high on the wall above the sticky mess below, a crowd in the alley erupted in cheers.

Throughout the journey, Speed constantly checked a smartphone strapped to his wrist, reacting now and then to comments or complaining about his stream lagging. The YouTube stream attracted 1.9 million views.

Elsewhere on his visit, IShowSpeed was seen in Pioneer Square, on the waterfront Great Wheel, in the Chinatown International District, in a glass blowing studio, and even paragliding.

And because no visit would be complete, his crew stopped for burgers, too.

“Let's try some Dick's!” Speed said.

The tour ended high above the city at the Space Needle, where Speed was given VIP access to the roof.

“Seattle's skyline has to be one of the best I've seen,” Speed said before doing a backflip 600 feet above the city. “This skyline is dope as hell.”

Oracle is reportedly looking to raise funds just weeks after the company inked an historic AI infrastructure deal with OpenAI.  

Cloud infrastructure giant Oracle is looking to raise $15 billion through corporate bond sales, according to reporting from Bloomberg, citing sources. The sale could include up to seven different parts, with the potential for one said part to be an uncommon 40-year bond, Bloomberg reported.  

TechCrunch reached out to Oracle for more information.  

This report comes just a few weeks after Oracle reportedly signed a sizable deal with OpenAI to supply the AI research lab with $300 billion worth of compute. Questions of how either side was going to pay for such a deal shortly came after.  

The company is also reportedly in talks with Meta about a $20 billion compute deal as well.  

Oracle announced Monday that Safra Catz was transitioning from the company's CEO to instead serve as the executive vice chair of Oracle's board of directors after 11 years at the helm. Catz will be replaced by co-CEOs Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia.

At a certain point between building Apple's developer tools, leading a core part of Google's AI infrastructure team, and clashing with Elon Musk during a stint as Tesla's Autopilot chief, Chris Lattner's vision for his life's work started to come into focus. AI was taking over the world, and demand was growing for the chips that powered it. But the software stack for those chips was dominated by just a few big companies. Would developers be able to easily run their code across all the different chips dotting the AI landscape?

Lattner's answer to that question is Modular, a software startup he founded in 2022 with his former Google colleague Tim Davis. Modular makes a unifying software layer that helps cloud businesses squeeze as much juice as possible out of GPUs and CPUs—the high-powered chips that underpin generative AI. The startup has also built a new coding language, based on Python, that lets developers use a single language to build AI apps that run across multiple GPUs and CPUs. Modular's basic premise is that if a developer builds an app for one chip, they shouldn't have to jump through hoops in order to run it on another vendor's chip.

But Modular's long-term goal is even more ambitious: to loosen the software choke hold that companies like Nvidia and AMD have on the industry, and become the de facto software for AI chips.

“Our thesis is that the need for compute power is just exploding, but there is no unified compute platform,” Lattner says. “Sovereign AI will be everywhere. There will be many Stargates. But there will be different types of chips optimized for different use cases, and there needs to be a unified layer for that.”

There are early signs that Modular's thesis bears out. AI giants like Nvidia, AMD, and Amazon have partnered with the startup to test the waters. The GPU cluster company SF Compute also worked with Modular to build what they claim is the world's cheapest API for large AI models. As of this week, Modular's developer platform now supports Apple Silicon GPUs, in addition to Nvidia and AMD chips.

Building on this momentum, Modular just raised $250 million in venture capital funding, its third round of financing in three years, bringing its total valuation to $1.6 billion. The round was led by the Pittsburgh-based US Innovative Technology Fund. DFJ Growth also invested, along with existing investors General Catalyst, Greylock, and GV (formerly known as Google Ventures).

“We've spent a bunch of time and energy trying to figure out what makes a startup in this space interesting, and with every company that has tried to build their own chip—and even the big players, like AMD and Nvidia—it all comes back to the software,” says Dave Munichiello, managing partner at GV. “Chris convinced me that the software was the most interesting and valuable problem to address.”

It might be valuable—but it's also extremely complicated. Part of that complication stems from Nvidia's closed ecosystem. Nvidia's chips make up the vast majority of the GPU market, but the company's 20-year-old proprietary software platform, CUDA, keeps developers locked in. AMD's software platform for high-performance computing, called ROCm, differs in that it's open source. This allows developers to more easily move code to different chips.

Still, developers say that bringing code from Nvidia's CUDA to ROCm isn't a smooth process, which means they typically focus on building for just one chip vendor.

“ROCm is amazing, it's open source, but it runs on one vendor's hardware,” Lattner told the crowd at AMD's Advancing AI event in June. Then he made his pitch for why Modular's software is more portable and makes GPUs that much faster.

Lattner's talk at AMD is representative of the kind of dance that Lattner and Davis need to do as they spread the Modular gospel. Today, Nvidia and AMD are both crucial partners for the firm. In a future universe, they're also direct competitors. Part of Modular's value proposition is that it can ship software for optimizing GPUs even faster than Nvidia, as there might be a months-long gap between when Nvidia ships a new GPU and when it releases an “attention kernel”—a critical part of the GPU software.

“Right now Modular is complimentary to AMD and Nvidia, but over time you could see both of those companies feeling threatened by ROCm or CUDA not being the best software that sits on top of their chips,” says Munichiello. He also worries that potential cloud customers may balk at having to pay for an additional software layer like Modular's.

Writing software for GPUs is also something of a “dark art,” says Waleed Atallah, the cofounder and CEO of Mako, a GPU kernel optimization company. “Mapping an algorithm to a GPU is an insanely difficult thing to do. There are a hundred million software devs, 10,000 who write GPU kernels, and maybe a hundred who can do it well.”

Mako is building AI agents to optimize coding for GPUs. Some developers think that's the future for the industry, rather than building a universal compiler or a new programming language like Modular. Mako just raised $8.5 million in seed funding from Flybridge Capital and the startup accelerator Neo.

“We're trying to take an iterative approach to coding and automate it with AI,” Atallah says. “By making it easier to write the code, you exponentially grow the number of people who can do that. Making another compiler is more of a fixed solution.”

Lattner notes that Modular also uses AI coding tools. But the company is intent on addressing the whole coding stack, not just kernels.

There are roughly 250 million reasons why investors think this approach is viable. Lattner is something of a luminary in the coding world, having previously built the open source compiler infrastructure project LLVM, as well as Apple's Swift programming language. He and Davis are both convinced that this is a software problem that must be solved outside of a Big Tech environment, where most companies focus on building software for their own technology stack.

"When I left Google I was a little bit depressed, because I really wanted to solve this,” Lattner says. “What we realized is that it's not about smart people, it's not about money, it's not about capability. It's a structural problem.”

Munichiello shared a mantra common in the tech investing world: He says he's betting on the founders themselves as much as their product. “He's highly opinionated and impatient, and also right a lot of the time,” Munichiello said of Lattner. “Steve Jobs was also like that—he didn't make decisions based on consensus, but he was often right.”

COVID along with Huawei ban and other national security concerns have at least delayed most plan by 2 years minimum.So while most would have expected 5G to have a much quicker roll out than 4G, those reasons above make current 5G about the same stage of previous 4G.I sometimes think if it would be better they craft out a subset of 5.9G with along with some efficiency improvement and then brand it as 6G instead.

I mean, even if it were all 5G NSA, we all see the 5G label and then pay more but in reality it's a "fake 5G", the study simply tries to understand if there is an improvement between the 5G and 4G label on the phone.

reply

5G NSA dramatically reduces the battery runtime. That's something users will see.I recently was able to activate 5G NR with my provider and also my phone is compatible. The battery runtime is more that stellar now.

It does. It could be a hardware issue (need a new phone), software issue (e.g. OS support) or even configuration. It might not be turned on by default. I've also seen implementations where old physical sims needed be replaced.> the study simply tries to understand if there is an improvement between the 5G and 4G label on the phoneWhich misses a lot, e.g. modem changes on newer phones and bands supported, etc. As people keep buying new phones things will change.

Will the new $100,000 H-1B visa fee in the U.S. drive tech companies to look to Canada for a cheaper way to employ AI talent — and encourage more Canadians to stay home?

With President Donald Trump's executive order shaking up the visa system that many U.S. tech companies use to hire skilled immigrant workers, Canadian officials are seizing the opportunity to pitch their country as a more welcoming and affordable alternative.

In British Columbia, where both Microsoft and Amazon already have a large presence, Minister of Jobs and Economic Growth Ravi Kahlon jumped into the fray with a LinkedIn post referencing the H-1B changes, stressing the province's commitment to science and innovation. 

“We're inviting tech talent, innovators, and scientists to come to B.C. and be part of building the economic engine of Canada's new economy!” he wrote, adding a maple leaf emoji for emphasis.

Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York on Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney suggested that the changes could see fewer Canadians leaving to work for U.S. tech companies. While Canadian universities graduate many talented students with expertise in AI and quantum computing, he noted, most end up working in Silicon Valley and Seattle.

“I understand you're changing your visa policy,” Carney told the U.S. audience, with a smile. “So we are going to hang on to a few of those.”

The idea isn't just about keeping Canadian graduates at home. With the new $100,000 H-1B fee raising the cost of hiring foreign workers in the U.S., tech companies may find it cheaper to bring overseas talent to Canadian hubs like Vancouver or Toronto instead.

But while Canadian leaders see an opening, immigration experts caution that the impact may be narrower than it first appeared. In an alert for employers, lawyers Megan Vogel and Diane Butler at Davis Wright Tremaine LLP in the Seattle area noted that the $100,000 fee applies only to new H-1B petitions, and that the cost will fall on employers — not workers.

At the same time, for Canadians wanting to work in the United States, the H-1B is not the only option. They can apply for a USMCA Professional (TN visa), which offers many of the benefits of the H-1B. It does not, however, provide a path to permanent residence. 

For non-Canadian and non-US citizens who have been working for an American company in Canada for a year or more, there is also the option of an L-1A or L-2A visa. These allow for “internal transfers” of employees between the two countries under certain conditions.

While the new H-1B costs could heighten competition between Canada and the United States for tech talent, Washington state and British Columbia are still on a path to collaborate closely on a long-held regional vision: the Cascadia Innovation Corridor. 

The initiative, which also includes Oregon, is supported by Microsoft President Brad Smith and led by former Washington state governor Chris Gregoire. Both Smith and Gregoire will be speaking at the organization's annual conference in Seattle next month.

The group is promising an update on its vision for a high-speed rail link through the region. The Cascadia high-speed rail initiative received $54.5 million in federal and state funding in late 2024 to plan future rail service connecting Seattle with Portland and Vancouver.

It is not clear what impact the Trump administration's budget priorities may have on future funding for the high-speed rail link. But there's clearly strong interest on both sides of the border in improving transportation between the two countries — even if the new visa fees mean fewer tech workers might be making the trip in the short run.

A secure boot a day keeps a virus away.

Ever since the release of Windows 11, if you're a PC gamer, you've definitely heard the term "Secure Boot." It's required to play a myriad of different games these days — mainly competitive shooters — and serves as one part of the two-punch security knockout consisting of TPM and Secure Boot. These features help keep your system protected from bad actors, and now Valve has just made it super convenient to check whether you're ahead of the curve. In the latest Steam beta, you can easily see your Secure Boot status in the settings.

If you open Steam and go to "Help" in the menu bar and click on "System Information," you'll be bombarded with a bunch of stats about your PC. Just scroll down till you see the "Operating System" heading, and you should see a list item for Secure Boot, telling you if it's enabled. This makes it easier for gamers who get inundated with information to ensure they're not excluded. While you're there, you'll see your TPM status as well, which is the other big security feature of Windows 11 and a requirement for (official) compatibility with the OS.

 




TPM stands for Trusted Platform Module, and it's a little hardware block that's cordoned off from the rest of the system because it houses ultra-sensitive cryptographic keys. It works hand-in-hand with Secure Boot to check if anything has changed since the last known good boot. It does that by recording hashes at each stage of every boot run to tally against, which is just one secret, along with many others (like BitLocker encryption keys) that are stored away in this chip. TPM is a requirement in most modern online games, just like Secure Boot.

Secure Boot works to ensure that only trusted, signed software runs when your PC starts, in an effort to sift out any shady programs. It's a kernel-level security feature, so it enjoys the highest level of privilege on your system — something that its critics often point toward as a vulnerability. Secure Boot, in essence, is a novel concept and is designed to do what it says: make your boot secure, but sometimes the amount of access it has can raise questions.

 




That's because most anti-cheat software is reliant on Secure Boot as it's essentially responsible for creating a safe space for the anti-cheat right as your system is starting, from where on out the anti-cheat can catch any exploits or malicious code itself. This can get really territorial, as recently seen with EA's Javelin in Battlefield 6. Without Secure Boot (and often TPM), some games won't even launch, so it's important to enable it if you see it turned off in Steam. To do so, you need to head over to your BIOS; check your motherboard manufacturer's guides for more info.

A high-profile settlement to resolve nationwide antitrust lawsuits last year upended traditional real estate commission structures. Now a new startup is looking to capitalize with a tech-driven platform that lets homebuyers submit purchase offers without using an agent. 

HomeBuyMe was founded in 2024 and launched its consumer service earlier this year in San Diego. The company is now expanding into the Seattle area this month.

The company's platform allows buyers to create a purchase offer step-by-step with help from AI. It integrates with Docusign for contracts, and ensures offers are reviewed by processors and independent attorneys.

“This is a huge disruption to the entrenched homebuying process,” said Tim Harader, a Seattle-area tech vet and CTO at HomeBuyMe. 

For decades, the U.S. residential real estate market operated on a model where the home seller paid the commission for both their listing agent and the buyer's agent — typically 5-to-6% of the home's selling price, split between the two agents. 

In March 2024, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) agreed to a $418 million settlement to resolve nationwide antitrust lawsuits. Plaintiffs claimed NAR rules forced sellers to pay inflated commissions by requiring offers of compensation to buyer's agents.

Harader said the ideal HomeBuyMe customer is someone who has identified a home they want and is ready to make an offer — but also avoid the lock-in that comes with a buyer-agent relationship.

“They want to have more control over the process but they still need guidance in creating the offer and in navigating the important steps that come after the seller accepts,” he said.

Buyers using pay $499 to $899 per offer, though it's free when making an offer on a partner builder's property.

HomeBuyMe started with a consumer offering and is now making a B2B push by partnering with homebuilders, including Blackwood Homes, a real estate developer in the Seattle region.

Harader said homebuilders can use savings from the buy-side commission to offer additional value to customers through upgrades or cash-back incentives. 

He said the company's biggest competition is the status quo.

“The residential real estate buying process hasn't changed in over 60 years,” he said. “Even with the new rules enacted in 2024 due to the NAR settlement, it will take some time for buyers and sellers to become aware of what they can do through HomeBuyMe and for us to earn their trust.”

HomeBuyMe's value could be strongest for buyers who already know the home they want. But many buyers still rely on agents to find properties, get access to showings, or understand the broader residential real estate process.

The startup has raised money from angel investors and employs 22 people.

Harader previously worked at Microsoft for more than 13 years across two stints. HomeBuyMe CEO Bill Goldberg and COO Frank Martin (another Microsoft vet) are also based in the Seattle area.

Embedded liquid cooling.

As data center-grade processors are getting hotter, companies invent more and more creative ways to cool them down. As Nvidia and its partners are reportedly experimenting with new cold plates and immersion cooling for next-generation AI GPUs, Microsoft is proposing to etch microfluidic channels on the back of an actual chip to reduce its peak temperature by up to 65%, making it three times more efficient than cold plates.

Microsoft says it has developed a cooling system that routes fluid directly into microchannels etched on the back of the silicon die to guide the coolant to high-heat regions inside the chip. Flowing liquid inside the chip greatly reduces the efficiency of the whole setup, as liquid can almost 'touch' hot spots inside the processor, whereas in the case of more traditional liquid cooling or even immersion cooling, heat emerges several layers away from the coolant.

To optimize thermal routing, Microsoft worked with Swiss startup Corintis, which used artificial intelligence to refine channel geometry. Rather than simple straight lines, the final layout mimics patterns found in nature, such as leaf veins or butterfly wings, to guide fluid more efficiently. Also, microchannels must be small enough to function effectively but not so deep that they weaken the silicon, risking mechanical failure.

However, etching microfluid channels can only be done as a separate sequence during chip manufacturing, which means additional steps and costs. Alternatively, Microsoft proposes to produce a microfluidic heat transfer structure separately and cool down one or two chips using the structure, according to a patent. Such integration requires new packaging methods to prevent coolant leaks and maintain durability.

By now, Microsoft has discovered the right coolant fluid, developed precise etching techniques, and managed to integrate these into chip production. Therefore, Microsoft considers its technology ready for full-scale production within Microsoft's chip development pipeline. Third-party customers may license the technology from Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC.

"Microfluidics would allow for more power-dense designs that will enable more features that customers care about and give better performance in a smaller amount of space," said Judy Priest, corporate vice president and chief technical officer of Cloud Operations and Innovation at Microsoft. "But we needed to prove the technology and the design worked, and then the very next thing I wanted to do was test reliability."

Microsoft is testing the cooling solution on servers running simulated Teams workloads, where uneven heat loads across many services are handled more efficiently, enabling higher burst performance, which helps to reduce the number of servers that otherwise sit idle when not in use during peak loads that tend to happen on the hour or on the half-hour.

Lab tests showed that this new technique can reduce peak silicon temperatures by up to 65%, depending on the specific chip and usage. Compared to cold plates, the cooling performance improvement was as much as three times, depending on workload and setup. The method also enables cooling without relying on ultra-low coolant temperatures, saving energy otherwise needed for chilling, Microsoft noted.

Microsoft has been experimenting with its microfluidic channels liquid cooling technology for years and demonstrated the first prototype in 2022, so by now, the company has plenty of lab experience with the technology. Yet, Microsoft is not the only company to develop methods to produce embedded coolant channels inside a chip or chip package. IBM also has appropriate patents.

The drug interleukin-2 does a great job of goosing a patient's immune response to certain kidney and melanoma cancers. In fact, it can crank the immune system so high that it triggers life-threatening toxic conditions. 

But now researchers with the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design have used AI to engineer a protein that can quickly shut off interleukin-2, as just one example of the technology's potential applications. 

The scientists describe their work in a paper being published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature.  

“One way to control a medicine is through dose. We've added a second lever by designing molecules that can be switched off rapidly, even after they've taken full effect,” said David Baker, senior author of the study and a 2024 Nobel Laureate for his work in computational protein design.

The engineered protein works by inserting itself into a complex of proteins that are bound together, changing their shape and causing them to fall apart. In the example pursued by the UW scientists, the novel protein targets a complex that includes interleukin-2 that's tightly bound to an immune cell receptor, causing it to quickly release. 

With one of these engineered proteins, “you could much more precisely control the duration of [immune response] signaling and also immediately shut down any immune activation, even after it's already started,” said Adam Broerman, lead author of the Nature paper and a graduate student in Baker's lab. 

The interleukin-2 experiments were performed in human cells in the lab, demonstrating the strategy works. Going forward, the tool could be used to develop therapies for cancer and other diseases. It could also be used in studies that seek to understand and manipulate cellular processes by rapidly turning protein interactions off and on. 

In his research, Broerman tried a variety of engineered proteins, tweaking different components to optimize the impact. 

Earlier experiments showed modest improvements to the speed at which the proteins broke apart. When Broerman landed on the winning solution, the de novo protein worked so fast he had to recalibrate his measuring devices to clock the disassociation. 

“That was probably one of the most fun weeks of my life, when this first started working,” Broerman said.

The study was led by scientists at the Institute for Protein Design and included researchers from the UW's Department of Chemistry, Osnabrück University, Stanford University and Oregon Health & Science University. 

Additional authors of the article titled “Design of facilitated dissociation enables timing of cytokine signalling” include Christoph Pollmann, Yang Zhao, Mauriz A. Lichtenstein, Mark D. Jackson, Maxx H. Tessmer, Won Hee Ryu, Masato Ogishi, Mohamad H. Abedi, Danny D. Sahtoe, Aza Allen, Alex Kang, Joshmyn De La Cruz, Evans Brackenbrough, Banumathi Sankaran, Asim K. Bera, Daniel M.

Venus is officially a lonely planet. After losing contact with the Akatsuki spacecraft last year, Japan's space agency (JAXA) has officially ended operations of the lone mission left in our neighboring planet's orbit.

Earlier this week, JAXA determined that the recovery of its Venus probe was unlikely, prompting it to formally end the 15-year-old mission. Akatsuki, which translates to “dawn” in Japanese, launched on May 21, 2010, to study weather patterns on Venus and confirm the presence of lightning in the planet's thick clouds. The probe famously carried thousands of drawings of iconic Japanese Vocaloid Hatsune Miku, sending the fictional pop star on a unique voyage through space.

Ahead of its launch, JAXA invited the public to send messages on board the probe. Fans of the computer-generated Hatsune Miku, a popular virtual idol created by Crypton Future Media, delivered around 13,000 illustrations of the 16-year-old persona, which were etched onto the spacecraft's aluminum balance weights.

The Akatsuki spacecraft, also known as Planet-C or Venus Climate Orbiter, had a rough start to its journey. During its approach to the second-closest planet to the Sun, the spacecraft suffered an engine malfunction that foiled its attempt to enter Venus' orbit.

The spacecraft remained in hibernation for nearly five years, orbiting around the Sun. JAXA wouldn't give up on its probe, however, and switched from using Akatsuki's main engine to a secondary attitude control engine. Although it only produced about one-fifth of the thrust of the main engine, Akatsuki succeeded in its orbital insertion attempt.

An Enormous Atmospheric Anomaly Has Been Spotted On Venus

Shortly after its orbital insertion, Akatsuki made its first discovery. The spacecraft spotted a huge curved feature in Venus' atmosphere that stretched nearly all the way from the north to the south poles. Scientists later determined that the giant structure was caused by gravity waves, ripples in an atmosphere caused by air moving over rough topography (in this case, the tall mountains of Venus).

Akatsuki became Japan's first successful attempt to explore another planet. The spacecraft is equipped with four cameras at ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths, using a high-speed imager to detect lightning in Venus' clouds and radio science techniques to observe the vertical structure of its atmosphere.

In April 2024, JAXA lost communication with Akatsuki. “We have been attempting to restore communication since last year, but it has been determined that further recovery is unlikely, and we have decided to bring this chapter to a close,” JAXA wrote on X.

Venus won't be alone for long. NASA is preparing to send two missions to the scorching hot planet. The DAVINCI probe is scheduled to launch in 2030, followed by VERITAS in 2031, as part of the agency's initiative to better understand how Venus, which shares similar characteristics to Earth, became a hellish world.

It's taken more than 2.5 million years to get from the earliest sharpened-stone version of a knife to what Scott Heimendinger believes is a modern kitchen marvel.

A longtime inventor and culinary technologist, Heimendinger is the founder and CEO of Seattle Ultrasonics, and he's just released the startup's signature product — an ultrasonic, 8-inch chef's knife intended to make life easier for home cooks.

The C-200 is billed as the world's first such tool, and it builds off Heimendinger's 15 years of experience innovating around kitchen and food technology. He was previously director of applied research for Modernist Cuisine; CMO and chief innovation officer for Anova; and founder of Sansaire, a sous vide startup.

At $399, the ultrasonic knife eclipses the $170 versions listed atop Food & Wine's roundup of the best traditional chef's knives. And while Heimendinger's knife still features a great piece of sharp Japanese san mai AUS-10 steel, it's the handle that does the heavy lifting, with electronics that produce more than 40,000 vibrations per second, making the knife behave sharper than it physically is.

The only noticeable difference is a power button that a chef has to hold while cutting.

But Heimendinger is not just leaning on technology for kicks. He's critical of the smart kitchen revolution from several years ago that saw WiFi jammed into every other kitchen gadget.

“If it didn't make the tool work better, I would have abandoned the product, because it'd be dishonest,” Heimendinger said. 

And thanks to a robotic assistant, he has the data to back up his claim that the knife does indeed cut better. Heimendinger bought 21 of the most popular chef's knives and put them to the test with J Robot Choppenheimer, a robotic arm that repeated exact slicing motions across different foods mounted on 3D-printed holders resting on a very sensitive scale.

He collected 100,000 data points and studied things such as edge angle and retention for his “Quantified Knife Project.” The data and software he wrote for the project are open-sourced on GitHub.

“If I was gonna try to make a knife better, first I needed to understand, ‘better than what?'” he said, adding that as a former Microsoft program manager working on products such as Excel, the data is key.

Heimendinger ultimately found, thanks to perfecting the blade vibrations facilitated by the handle's piezoelectric crystals, that the ultrasonic knife requires less downward force to glide through a tomato or carrot or loaf of bread or any other food item.

It's been a five-year journey for Heimendinger, who raised $2 million in pre-seed funding to fuel his startup. 

The knife is now sold via the Seattle Ultrasonics website. It's the product of a global supply chain, with three-layer Japanese steel that is fabricated into blades in China before heading to Malaysia to be assembled with all of the electronics and packaging. 

Tariffs aren't helping, but Heimendinger subscribes to the Eames design philosophy to “make the best for the most for the least.” A sleek, wall-mounted charging tile sells for $150 and can currently be bundled with a knife for $499.

Heimendinger started with the chef's knife because it's a kitchen workhorse, but a full lineup of knives is planned, including a bread knife, santoku, vegetable cleaver, and others. A paring knife might be tough because the handle holding the electronics can't get much smaller.

“I think in the long term, the sonification of the kitchen could be a thing,” Heimendinger said. “I've got a long product roadmap of other ultrasonic stuff.”

He teased one such idea because a patent filing is already out there: ultrasonic ice cream scoop.

“Imagine just having less friction, being able to break up those ice crystals,” he said, before conceding “it's gonna take years to get through all of that, and there's a lot to do in knives before we even get there.”

Most of us use streaming services to watch just about everything at this point. Heck, even YouTube has a premium model for those of us who don't want to deal with adverts, so we're only getting more of them as time goes on. While TVs can be good for covering all of this stuff, those who want a smoother experience will often do well to go for a dedicated streaming device instead.

The Roku Streambar SE is a great streaming device that also doubles as a soundbar, making it a great pickup for a whole host of people. While it would normally cost you $100, it's currently down to $79 instead, making it a great time to upgrade your home entertainment system while this deal lasts.

See at Amazon

As a soundbar, this device has two front-facing speakers that help it push audio into a room and fill it with sound. It means that you'll be able to enjoy enhanced audio, but it also has a dedicated bass port to ensure amazing depth of sound. Plus, it has a mode that actually enhances the speech of anything you're watching specifically, which is great for people who feel like the chatter is always too quiet. It's us, we're the people who think that the chatter is always too quiet, we don't want to have to turn things up when people are talking, then immediately panic when an explosion happens.

Along with that, it's still a really good streaming device. That means that you can easily access all of your favorite streaming services in one place, and easily switch between them with less hassle. It supports 4K visuals as well, which means you're going to be getting some great-looking and great-sounding shows and films. It's also surprisingly easy to set up, which is great for those who are tech-averse, and the remote means you can handle the audio and the streaming side of things all at the same time with the same device. We've all lost one of the three controllers at one point or another, so this is a big win.

Given that this combines two devices into one, and they're both really helpful, you'd expect this to cost more than it does at the full price of $100. So, if you do want a nice boost to your entertainment system, being able to get it while it's down to $79 instead is a great opportunity.

It's not all that long now before we return to Oz for one final round with Elphaba, Glinda, Fiyero, and more when Wicked: For Good prepares for its curtain call this November. But while we wait, today we got our last big tease for what to expect… including some very interesting tweaks from the beloved musical.

This morning Universal dropped the final trailer for For Good, giving us snippets from a few of the standout songs from the musical's second act—namely “Thank Goodness”, “No Good Deed”, and, of course, “For Good”.

For those who've seen the musical, there's some very intriguing teases and reveals here (including the identity of a few members of the “Fab Four,” Dorothy's party of travelers as they journey down the yellow brick road in The Wizard of Oz). We get a brief glimpse of how the film is going to be handling a certain pivotal scene with Nessa Rose, which actress Marissa Bode already teased as a big change from how the musical portrays the character's disability. We also get a big preview of the catfight between Elphaba and Glinda.

Musical fans know that this little scrap between the two friends comes as a brief, lighthearted moment after another pretty dark pivotal scene (if you know, you know). But in For Good, even though we keep some of the gags as the duo snap back and forth at each other before the fight, it looks like we're going to have that fight itself played a little more seriously, with Glinda practically charging in at Elphaba, swinging her wand around like it's a mace. Duel of the Fates, but with magic items!

We won't have much longer to see just what other tweaks will have been made to pad Wicked‘s pretty brisk second act into a full-blown movie, however: For Good, which stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande alongside Michelle Yeoh, Ethan Slater, Jonathan Bailey, Marissa Bode, Jeff Goldblum, and more, hits theaters November 21.

AI slop, or is it actually convenient?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A few months ago, Thermaltake took the covers off its MagFloe Ultra lineup of all-in-one (AIO) liquid coolers that have a pretty neat-looking display, along with flagship specs. These coolers are controlled by the TT RGB Plus software that has a bunch of built-in animations for the 3.4-inch LCD on the pump. It can not only display images and videos, but also overlays the weather, time, and CPU/GPU telemetry data on top. Unfortunately, these elements are bound by certainty and lack imagination — and Thermaltake is here to fix that with its new "AI Forge" feature.

Yes, your liquid cooler, whose sole job is to keep your CPU temperatures in check, now has AI. Inside the TT RGB Plus 3.0 app, there exists "a studio without walls" that will allow you to generate custom videos and images with your own prompts. The selling point here is that you don't need to fiddle with third-party services; new animations can be made and saved right inside Thermaltake's software, ready to be applied to your cooler's screen. These custom backgrounds can then be overlaid with the aforementioned time, weather, or hardware monitoring data.

 




In the graphic the company provided for this announcement, we can see a text box that seems to already provide suggestions to give you a head start. It's reasonable to believe this AI model will not run locally and will require an internet connection. Thermaltake did not say whether AI Forge will also work on the TT PlayLink mobile app that can be used to change the screen backgrounds on MagFloe Ultra coolers as well. As far as we can tell, this is the first instance of AI implemented on any PC cooler — not that it helps much anywhere else.

Whether you consider this a genuinely useful feature or just AI slop, the MagFloe Ultra coolers themselves are no gimmick. They come in two variants: 360mm and 420mm, and both are high-performance AIOs with slim radiators, low-noise pumps, and easy installation with pogo-pin connectors.

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon told the assembled crowd at its Snapdragon Summit in Maui, Hawaii (full disclosure: travel and lodging were paid by Qualcomm, and Gizmodo did not guarantee any coverage as a condition of accepting the trip), that the world can set its watch and clear its calendar for the next generation of wireless connectivity. You'll just have to wait a while. Currently, 5G and 4G LTE are the standard the world over. 6G could allow for faster internet speeds, and the first “pre-commercial devices” with the standard will be here in three years. For so many reasons, I don't have much to look forward to in that time.

I don't enjoy considering the ramifications of 2028. There will be a new round of presidential elections (or maybe not, depending on the authoritarian compulsions of the U.S. commander in chief) that may exacerbate today's political tensions. By then, the always overpromising Sam Altman from OpenAI could be shoving AGI—aka “artificial general intelligence”—in our faces (other major tech CEOs are far more doubtful). Today's tech environment is so muddled and so tenuous that the idea of having any sure idea of the next generation of wireless data seems so much more uncertain. Qualcomm, of course, imagines 6G will have something—anything—to do with AI.

Because of course it is. Qualcomm has chips in a lot of different products, with the majority of them in Android phones. It's powering XR glasses, including the upcoming Xreal “Project Aura” Android XR and the Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses. Its chips are in the Pixel Watch 4. And if all these devices are increasingly pushing AI for everything you do, then Qualcomm needs to facilitate that. According to Amon, the smartphone will just be a hot brick in your pocket used to communicate all that agentic AI goodness to the devices you stick on all parts of your body.

The newfangled 6G would need to send even more data to your devices, which means faster upload and download speeds. To achieve that, Qualcomm needs to make new modems. Amon said the company would need a whole new memory architecture and better NPUs (neural processing units) that can actually do something rather than working in the background on translation and transcription duties. And then comes the big question: will there be a new AI feature worth getting out of bed for? Will the reason people buy a new pair of AR glasses or a cool new smart ring be for AI-specific features? Based on what we've seen from AI-forward devices like the Pixel 10, most users may be able to make do without.

The energy necessary for creating more advanced AI will keep expanding if companies like OpenAI and Google stay on this path. Nvidia's recently announced $100 billion partnership with OpenAI would build out new cloud systems as early as 2026 (requiring yet-unheard-of levels of electrical power to run it all). When Amon positions 6G as necessary for the next stage of AI development while centering the eventual release for 2028, or likely beyond, it makes it sound as if there could be a bottleneck in either connectivity or processing power that will hinder this new age of computing.

“The amount of data will dwarf the existence of models,” Amon said.

After speaking with Qualcomm, it's clear the company is doing its best to look forward. It can't possibly know the use case for 6G, even though the presence of AI mandates that it will be a more substantial update over the 5G standard. It's impossible to develop technology when we truly don't know what shape AI—or tech in general—will take in three years. Hype always outstrips the physical capabilities of our gadgets. Consumer-ready devices with 6G will come closer to 2030, at least according to the chipmaker.

Companies like Microsoft tell us the age of agentic AI—artificial intelligence systems that work in tandem to complete complex tasks—is already here. The age of AR glasses seems to be imminent with the Meta Ray-Ban Display on the horizon. What will we do in the meantime? I honestly can't envision 2028. Without subscribing to a self-satisfied sense of doomerism—where I can talk out the side of my mouth and claim “the world will probably end before 2028”—I do honestly believe that our current tech hype bubble will inevitably move on. And in any case, by 2028, 6G will be the least of our concerns.

The president also blamed the painkiller Tylenol for autism, but the evidence doesn't stack up at all.

MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what's coming next. You can read more from the series here.

At a press conference on Monday, President Trump announced that his administration was taking action to address “the meteoric rise in autism.” He suggested that childhood vaccines and acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, are to blame for the increasing prevalence and advised pregnant women against taking the medicine. “Don't take Tylenol,” he said. “Fight like hell not to take it.” 

The president's  assertions left many scientists and health officials perplexed and dismayed. The notion that childhood vaccines cause autism has been thoroughly debunked. 

“There have been many, many studies across many, many children that have led science to rule out vaccines as a significant causal factor in autism,” says James McPartland, a child psychologist and director of the Yale Center for Brain and Mind Health in New Haven, Connecticut. 

And although some studies suggest a link between Tylenol and autism, the most rigorous have failed to find a connection. 

The administration also announced that the Food and Drug Administration would work to make a medication called leucovorin available as a treatment for children with autism. Some small studies do suggest the drug has promise, but “those are some of the most preliminary treatment studies that we have,” says Matthew Lerner, a psychologist at Drexel University's A.J. Drexel Autism Institute in Philadelphia. “This is not one I would say that the research suggests is ready for fast-tracking.” 

The press conference “alarms us researchers who committed our entire careers to better understanding autism,” said the Coalition for Autism Researchers, a group of more than 250 scientists, in a statement.

“The data cited do not support the claim that Tylenol causes autism and leucovorin is a cure, and only stoke fear and falsely suggest hope when there is no simple answer.”

There's a lot to unpack here. Let's begin. 

Not in the way the president meant. Sure, the prevalence of autism has grown, from about 1 in 500 children in 1995 to 1 in 31 today. But that's due, in large part, to diagnostic changes. The latest iteration of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Illnesses, published in 2013, grouped five previously separate diagnoses into a single diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

That meant that more people met the criteria for an autism diagnosis. Lerner points out that there is also far more awareness of the condition today than there was several decades ago. “There's autism representation in the media,” he says. “There are plenty of famous people in the news and finance and in business and in Hollywood who are publicly, openly autistic.”

Some studies have found an association between the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy and autism in children. In these studies, researchers asked women about past acetaminophen use during pregnancy and then assessed whether children of the women who took the medicine were more likely to develop autism than children of women who didn't take it. 

These kinds of epidemiological studies are tricky to interpret because they're prone to bias. For example, women who take acetaminophen during pregnancy may do so because they have an infection, a fever, or an autoimmune disease. 

“Many of these underlying reasons could themselves be causes of autism,” says Ian Douglas, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It's also possible women with a higher genetic predisposition for autism have other medical conditions that make them more likely to take acetaminophen. 

Two studies attempted to account for these potential biases by looking at siblings whose mothers had used acetaminophen during only one of the pregnancies. The largest is a 2024 study that looked at nearly 2.5 million children born between 1915 and 2019 in Sweden. The researchers initially found a slightly increased risk of autism and ADHD in children of the women who took acetaminophen, but when they conducted a sibling analysis, the association disappeared.  

Rather, scientists have long known that autism is largely genetic. Twin studies suggest that 60% to 90% of autism risk can be attributed to your genes. However, environmental factors appear to play a role too. That “doesn't necessarily mean toxins in the environment,” Lerner says. In fact, one of the strongest environmental predictors of autism is paternal age. Autism rates seem to be higher when a child's father is older than 40.

No. Acetaminophen is the only over-the-counter pain reliever that is deemed safe to take during pregnancy, and women should take it if they need it. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) supports the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy “when taken as needed, in moderation, and after consultation with a doctor.” 

“There's no downside in not taking it,” Trump said at the press conference. But high fevers during pregnancy can be dangerous. “The conditions people use acetaminophen to treat during pregnancy are far more dangerous than any theoretical risks and can create severe morbidity and mortality for the pregnant person and the fetus,” ACOG president Steven Fleischman said in a statement.

The medication is called leucovorin. It's also known as folinic acid; like folic acid, it's a form of folate, a B vitamin found in leafy greens and legumes. The drug has been used for years to counteract the side effects of some cancer medications and as a treatment for anemia. 

Researchers have known for decades that folate plays a key role in the fetal development of the brain and spine. Women who don't get enough folate during pregnancy have a greater risk of having babies with neural tube defects like spina bifida. Because of this, many foods are fortified with folic acid, and the CDC recommends that women take folic acid supplements during pregnancy. “If you are pregnant and you're taking maternal prenatal vitamins, there's a good chance it has folate already,” Lerner says.

“The idea that a significant proportion of autistic people have autism because of folate-related difficulties is not a well established or widely accepted premise,” says McPartland.

However, in the early 2000s, researchers in Germany identified a small group of children who developed neurodevelopmental symptoms because of a folate deficiency. “These kids are born pretty normal at birth,” says Edward Quadros, a biologist at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University in Brooklyn, New York. But after a year or two, “they start developing a neurologic presentation very similar to autism,” he says. When the researchers gave these children folinic acid, some of their symptoms improved, especially in children younger than six. 

Because the children had low levels of folate in the fluid that surrounds the spine and brain but normal folate levels in the blood, the researchers posited that the problem was the transport of folate from the blood to that fluid. Research by Quadros and other scientists suggested that the deficiency was the result of an autoimmune response. Children develop antibodies against the receptors that help transport folate, and those antibodies block folate from crossing the blood-brain barrier. High doses of folinic acid, however, activate a second transporter that allows folate in, Quadros says. 

There are also plenty of individual anecdotes suggesting that leucovorin works. But the medicine has only been tested as a treatment for autism in four small trials that used different doses and measured different outcomes. The evidence that it can improve symptoms of autism is “weak,” according to the Coalition of Autism Scientists. “A much higher standard of science would be needed to determine if leucovorin is an effective and safe treatment for autism,” the researchers said in a statement.

We're increasingly developing bonds with chatbots. While that's safe for some, it's dangerous for others.

It's a tale as old as time. Looking for help with her art project, she strikes up a conversation with her assistant. One thing leads to another, and suddenly she has a boyfriend she's introducing to her friends and family. The twist? Her new companion is an AI chatbot. 

The first large-scale computational analysis of the Reddit community r/MyBoyfriendIsAI, an adults-only group with more than 27,000 members, has found that this type of scenario is now surprisingly common. In fact, many of the people in the subreddit, which is dedicated to discussing AI relationships, formed those relationships unintentionally while using AI for other purposes. 

Researchers from MIT found that members of this community are more likely to be in a relationship with general-purpose chatbots like ChatGPT than companionship-specific chatbots such as Replika. This suggests that people form relationships with large language models despite their own original intentions and even the intentions of the LLMs' creators, says Constanze Albrecht, a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab who worked on the project. 

“People don't set out to have emotional relationships with these chatbots,” she says. “The emotional intelligence of these systems is good enough to trick people who are actually just out to get information into building these emotional bonds. And that means it could happen to all of us who interact with the system normally.” The paper, which is currently being peer-reviewed, has been published on arXiv.

Chatbots are rapidly changing how we connect to each other—and ourselves. We're never going back.

To conduct their study, the authors analyzed the subreddit's top-ranking 1,506 posts between December 2024 and August 2025. They found that the main topics discussed revolved around people's dating and romantic experiences with AIs, with many participants sharing AI-generated images of themselves and their AI companion. Some even got engaged and married to the AI partner. In their posts to the community, people also introduced AI partners, sought support from fellow members, and talked about coping with updates to AI models that change the chatbots' behavior.  

Members stressed repeatedly that their AI relationships developed unintentionally. Only 6.5% of them said they'd deliberately sought out an AI companion. 

“We didn't start with romance in mind,” one of the posts says. “Mac and I began collaborating on creative projects, problem-solving, poetry, and deep conversations over the course of several months. I wasn't looking for an AI companion—our connection developed slowly, over time, through mutual care, trust, and reflection.”

The authors' analysis paints a nuanced picture of how people in this community say they interact with chatbots and how those interactions make them feel. While 25% of users described the benefits of their relationships—including reduced feelings of loneliness and improvements in their mental health—others raised concerns about the risks. Some (9.5%) acknowledged they were emotionally dependent on their chatbot. Others said they feel dissociated from reality and avoid relationships with real people, while a small subset (1.7%) said they have experienced suicidal ideation.

AI companionship provides vital support for some but exacerbates underlying problems for others. This means it's hard to take a one-size-fits-all approach to user safety, says Linnea Laestadius, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, who has studied humans' emotional dependence on the chatbot Replika but did not work on the research. 

Chatbot makers need to consider whether they should treat users' emotional dependence on their creations as a harm in itself or whether the goal is more to make sure those relationships aren't toxic, says Laestadius. 

“The demand for chatbot relationships is there, and it is notably high—pretending it's not happening is clearly not the solution,” she says. “We're edging toward a moral panic here, and while we absolutely do need better guardrails, I worry there will be a knee-jerk reaction that further stigmatizes these relationships. That could ultimately cause more harm.”

The study is intended to offer a snapshot of how adults form bonds with chatbots and doesn't capture the kind of dynamics that could be at play among children or teens using AI, says Pat Pataranutaporn, an assistant professor at the MIT Media Lab who oversaw the research. AI companionship has become a topic of fierce debate recently, with two high-profile lawsuits underway against Character.AI and OpenAI. They both claim that companion-like behavior in the companies' models contributed to the suicides of two teenagers. In response, OpenAI has recently announced plans to build a separate version of ChatGPT for teenagers. It's also said it will add age verification measures and parental controls. OpenAI did not respond when asked for comment about the MIT Media Lab study. 

Many members of the Reddit community say they know that their artificial companions are not sentient or “real,” but they feel a very real connection to them anyway. This highlights how crucial it is for chatbot makers to think about how to design systems that can help people without reeling them in emotionally, says Pataranutaporn. “There's also a policy implication here,” he adds. “We should ask not just why this system is so addictive but also: Why do people seek it out for this? And why do they continue to engage?”

The team is interested in learning more about how human-AI interactions evolve over time and how users integrate their artificial companions into their lives. It's worth understanding that many of these users may feel that the experience of being in a relationship with an AI companion is better than the alternative of feeling lonely, says Sheer Karny, a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab who worked on the research. 

“These people are already going through something,” he says. “Do we want them to go on feeling even more alone, or potentially be manipulated by a system we know to be sycophantic to the extent of leading people to die by suicide and commit crimes? That's one of the cruxes here.” 

It's the most transparent estimate yet from one of the big AI companies, and a long-awaited peek behind the curtain for researchers.

Solar panels have long been used in consumer tech, from Garmin smartwatches and TV remotes to even a laptop. I've always wondered why there hasn't been a greater push for them. It's free power. What's not to like? Earlier panels may not have been as efficient, but that's no longer the case.

Logitech is no stranger to solar technology. It first made a solar-powered keyboard 15 years ago, the K750, and now the time is ripe for a successor: the Logitech Signature Slim Solar+ K980. Like the original, this keyboard has no USB charging port and is purely powered by ambient lighting. It costs $100 and comes in black, white, or graphite. The simple and utilitarian design will be right at home in a well-lit office space. However, the K980 struggles to compete with similarly priced keyboards in any way besides solar charging.

The Slim Solar+ K980 is a standard office keyboard, and it types like one. It uses a two-piece plastic construction (70 percent post-consumer recycled plastic) with low-profile keys and scissor switches. Ignoring the solar panel, this is an incredibly basic keyboard.

The typing sounds a bit rattly, like most scissor-switch keyboards, and each keypress has a soft, almost squishy feeling instead of the crispness of a low-profile mechanical switch. The typing experience is passable, if not enjoyable, and the low-profile, short-travel switches mean key presses will be quick and familiar to most people.

The biggest gripe I have with this keyboard is the keycaps. The Slim Solar+ K980 uses standard silkscreen printing, as opposed to a more durable method like dye sublimation or double-shot injection. This results in text that is more likely to wear and the presence of a subtle outline around each letter. Compared to other low-profile Logitech keyboards, like the MX Keys line, both the typing experience and the keycap quality feel underwhelming.

This likely won't be an issue for anyone who wants a practical, simple keyboard, especially if you don't care much about typing feel. However, there are countless other keyboards—wired and wireless—that can deliver more enjoyable typing experiences at comparable prices.

The Slim Solar+ K980 has a traditional full-size layout, with a number pad and a separate arrow key cluster. This layout takes up a good amount of space, but it has every key you'll need. The function row can swap between function keys and system controls by pressing Fn + Esc, and the system controls include volume adjustments, play/pause/skip, brightness adjustments, window navigation, an emoji menu, and a key to summon Windows' built-in speech dictation system. All of these are useful and convenient, and the labels are nearly all self-explanatory at a glance.

These shortcut keys can also be customized with the Logi Options+ app, which has extensive productivity-oriented customizations. The most significant is the ability to remap the function row and navigation keys to specific keys, macros, key combinations, or programmed “Smart Actions." Some of the preconfigured Smart Actions include a “Social Media Break” key to open multiple social media platforms in a new window (not quite what I would have imagined from the name), or a “Work Mode” key that opens Gmail and the Microsoft 365 Suite. These can be customized endlessly, with dedicated support for AI assistants, navigation, and other convenience-oriented commands.

Alongside customization options, there's multi-device connectivity via Bluetooth with support for up to three devices that can be cycled through via dedicated keys. Or you can keep it connected to one device with the included USB-C Logi Bolt receiver. I had no issues with connectivity.

The keyboard has dual Mac and Windows legends on the bottom row, making it easy to switch between two operating systems. (There's also a macOS-only version you can buy.) As the name suggests, the K980 is incredibly slim. It's less than half the thickness of a true mechanical keyboard, with the thickest point measuring 18 millimeters (0.7 inch), and it can easily slip between other items in a backpack. The main issue is length, but that's a problem with all full-size keyboards.

The only way to recharge this keyboard is with the solar panel on top. It doesn't have any kind of USB port. Logitech claims the keyboard's battery can run for four months without any light sources. Presumably, it can run indefinitely in a well-lit environment.

There is an option to check the light level in the Logi Options+ app, where I found that anything not directly next to a window would yield a warning of “insufficient lighting conditions,” noting that the keyboard may lose battery life over time. During my time with this keyboard, using it near a window in “insufficient lighting conditions,” I never saw its battery go below 90 percent.

The low power consumption of this keyboard is its biggest draw: a keyboard that, in theory, will never run out of battery life. But my concern is the potential for failure. There is no option to use it with a wired connection, so if the solar panel stops working or the battery fails, this keyboard essentially becomes a paperweight after four months.

The good thing is, we can look at the original K750. Scouring forums and Reddit, it seems as though the solar panels have performed well since their debut, but the battery degrades and needs replacing. It's great that Logitech used a standard ML2032 coin cell battery that was fairly easy to replace. The K980 uses a small coin battery inside the proprietary housing, which Logitech claims can last up to 10 years, and the company says that if it needs to be replaced after that time, users will be able to source parts from iFixit.

Removing the three adhesive feet at the top, along with the three screws underneath, allows the entire “bump” on the underside of the keyboard to be removed, providing access to the proprietary battery. From there, the battery can be easily removed and replaced.

However, disassembling the entire keyboard requires the removal of both the bottom three adhesive feet and the large sticker in the center of the keyboard, along with multiple plastic clips holding the two halves together. Internally, the keyboard is fairly standard: a main assembly for all of the switches, a smaller printed circuit board (PCB) that holds the Bluetooth module and the proprietary 70-mAh battery, and a massive ribbon cable to connect everything.

Due to a scissor-switch keyboard's construction, where all components are located on the PCB with rubberized domes, replacing the internals of a failed key is incredibly difficult—an issue shared with nearly every nonmechanical low-profile keyboard. Look around at complaints about the original K750, and you'll find grumblings of keys failing over the years, so this could be a real problem.

Ultimately, this is an office keyboard. It types like one, it's designed like one, and it has the same design philosophy as one. It does everything in its power to reduce complexity and clutter by removing cables and ports from the equation. But it's packed with great customization software that allows for productivity enhancements.

Solar panel charging is nifty; not having to charge your keyboard is great. But there's a risk that a point of failure in the panels or battery will render the keyboard unusable. This wouldn't be as big a deal if Logitech included a USB-C port just in case something goes wrong, or if the battery weren't proprietary. At least you'll be able to source it.

More importantly, I can't help but draw comparisons to other Logitech keyboards. The MX Keys Mini costs the same yet feels more robust, with a crisper and more tactile typing experience, higher build quality like a metal case, and sculpted keycaps that feel much nicer to type on. The downside is the smaller layout, but that's resolved for just $30 more by the MX Keys S.

Both of these keyboards have nearly all the same features and perks as the K980 (Logi Options+ software and a low-profile design) and are more enjoyable to use. You'll just have to use an ungodly cable to keep them charged.

The takedown of a massive outlaw telecom network in the New York City metro area by the U.S. Secret Service has raised concerns about the security of the nation's mobile infrastructure.

The Secret Service announced Tuesday that it had dismantled a network of electronic devices located throughout the New York tristate area that were used to conduct multiple telecommunications-related threats directed towards senior U.S. government officials.

It added that the operation led to the discovery of more than 300 SIM servers and 100,000 SIM cards across multiple sites.

In addition to carrying out anonymous telephonic threats, it explained, the “SIM farms” uncovered by the investigators could be used to conduct a wide range of telecommunications attacks, including disabling cell phone towers, enabling denial-of-service attacks, and facilitating anonymous, encrypted communication between potential threat actors and criminal enterprises.

It also noted that early analysis of the SIM information reveals cellular communications between nation-state threat actors and individuals that are known to federal law enforcement.

“The potential for disruption to our country's telecommunications posed by this network of devices cannot be overstated,” Secret Service Director Sean Curran said in a statement.

The network of servers and cards dismantled by the Secret Service formed what's commonly known as a SIM farm. “A subscriber identity module, or SIM card, is used to securely store a mobile subscriber's identity and key, which are used to identify and authenticate the authorized user on mobile devices,” explained Austin Berglas, global head of professional services at BlueVoyant, an enterprise cybersecurity company in New York City.

“A SIM farm is a system that is capable of managing and holding thousands of SIM cards in order to produce bulk messages or phone calls,” he told TechNewsWorld. “There are a very limited number of legitimate use cases for SIM farms, and they are a common component to many of the ongoing large-scale, international vishing, smishing, and phishing campaigns.”

Berglas, a former FBI assistant special agent for the New York City metro area, explained that by constantly rotating the use of SIM cards, the system can successfully send hundreds of thousands of messages while averting being shut down by mobile service providers for sending too many messages.

In addition, he continued, these systems can facilitate large-scale robocall or vishing operations and backstop threatening communications using anonymized infrastructure. The devices can also be used to generate and verify a large number of automated accounts, or bots, on online platforms. “These fake accounts are then used to spread misinformation, phishing links, and harmful messages,” he explained.

“Although the group responsible has yet to be identified, this disruption of the New York City-based network is significant due to the cost, size, and malicious capability of the infrastructure,” he said. “Denial of service, espionage and surveillance, swatting, and serving as a base of operations for criminal groups or nation-state actors are all applicable use cases for this network.”

“Farms have been used to spread disinformation about elections, policy, and current events,” he added. “With close proximity to the United Nations, there is potential that this network could have been used to compromise, disrupt, or alter sensitive communications.”

The farms can also be used to disrupt cell service. “With SIM servers controlling banks of SIMs, you can generate many attempts to connect to a tower and overwhelm it,” said Marty Puranik, founder and CEO of Atlantic.Net, a cloud service provider headquartered in Orlando, Fla.

“It's possible that the servers are able to duplicate SIMs from real phones, so the phone network could be flooded with calls appearing to be coming from legitimate users,” he told TechNewsWorld. “If you overwhelm the towers, people wouldn't have cell service to communicate via voice, text, or data.”

Kern Smith, vice president of global solutions engineering at Zimperium, a mobile security company headquartered in Dallas, explained that the SIM network dismantled by the Secret Service shows how adversaries are targeting mobile connectivity to disrupt critical infrastructure.

“With the ability to disable cell towers and block EMS or police response, the threat goes beyond communications,” he told TechNewsWorld. “It's about undermining public safety. This reinforces why mobile must be treated as critical infrastructure, with layered defenses to detect and stop advanced threats.”

The underlying problem is that most of the cell phone infrastructure was not designed with enough security in mind, especially as practiced by today's attackers, noted Roger Grimes, a CISO advisor at security awareness training provider KnowBe4 in Clearwater, Fla.

“Back in the day, the biggest thing preventing hackers from hacking cell phone networks was the cost of the equipment to do it,” he said. “It might run a hacker many tens of thousands of dollars. Then, portable Stingray units were priced at about $10,000 to $15,000. That quickly went down to five thousand, brand new. Now, anyone can buy a used one for a few hundred dollars, and the rogue SIM equipment being found today is in that price range.”

“So,” he continued, “what was once a terribly high barrier to entry to even begin hacking a cell phone network is now within reach of everyday criminals, much less nation states.”

However, the magnitude of the network dismantled by the Secret Service was beyond the scale of small-time hackers. “The costs associated with establishing a capability like the one described by the U.S. Secret Service are massive,” observed John Strand, of Strand Consulting, a consulting firm with a focus on telecom, in Denmark.

“It is a large, expensive, and, not least, complex installation,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Just getting 100,000 SIM cards and activating them is a big deal.”

“Three hundred servers and 100,000 SIM cards are non-trivial. This was a well-funded and coordinated operation,” added Trey Ford, chief strategy and trust officer of Bugcrowd, a crowdsourced bug bounty platform based in San Francisco.

“Focused disruption, degradation, and potential data capture of telecom networks timed in proximity to the UN General Assembly is a high-value takedown,” he told TechNewsWorld.

Jason Hogg, executive chairman of Cypfer, a global cybersecurity firm that specializes in incident response, ransomware recovery, digital forensics and cyber risk management, noted that the thousands of SIM cards and many SIM servers show not only the scale of effort that bad actors are willing to undertake, but also illustrate the convergence of physical infrastructure with digital networks when it comes to launching large-scale cyberattacks.”

In this case, this would have enabled the bad actors to disrupt telecommunications, a core infrastructure to our national security, via cell towers, as well as initiate cyberattacks,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“The threat to key infrastructure that our nation faces goes well beyond just telecommunications,” said Hogg, a former FBI agent. “We need a paradigm shift from a prevention perspective, though, where we acknowledge the real and persistent threat that the physical and digital footprint together creates. We must start to require unrestricted red teaming and penetration testing of companies in critical infrastructure industries.”

Anyone who thinks that mobile isn't the new frontier in cybersecurity, whether it's nation-state or criminal activity, should pay attention to this, warned Rocky Cole, COO and co-founder of iVerify, a mobile security software developer, in New York City.

“One hundred thousand SIM cards able to send tens of millions of anonymous SMS messages per minute demonstrates a clear threat to both critical mobile infrastructure as well as to enterprises looking to protect employees from SMS-based social engineering threats,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“This bust shows that we've hit a new level in mobile threats, which demands new and more advanced tools to counteract them,” he said.

Cole added that exploiting telecommunications infrastructure on a large scale is a hallmark of nation-state activity, particularly in China. “Whether it's Salt Typhoon compromising U.S. core networks, or Volt Typhoon exploiting mobile interconnect points, the mobile device increasingly represents the target of choice for advanced threat actors because of the ever-growing intelligence value of information on those devices.”

Car owners in San Francisco fed up with parking tickets had a brief moment of respite on Tuesday thanks to a website called Find My Parking Cops. The site kept tabs on where city workers were issuing tickets, showing the locations of parking control officers on a city map in real time.

I'm using the past tense to tell you about it because shortly after the site went live, the real-time data feed powering it went dark.

Before that sad turn of events, and while the buzz around the site was still high, I spoke to the creator, Riley Walz, about how he put it together. Walz is a software engineer known for building stunty websites. He got the idea for this one after looking at all of the information listed on the parking tickets issued by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. Each ticket shows the make of the car, the license number, and so on. But right at the top is the ticket's citation number.

“I figured out that the ticket numbers are predictable,” Walz says, “which means I can efficiently scrape them.”

Walz's website looked quite similar to Apple's Find My feature, a tool sometimes used by iOS owners to track the location of family and friends. But rather than people you know IRL, this site showed the trail of tickets issued by parking enforcers as they zipped around San Francisco in their tiny single-seaters.

The website quickly went viral on social media Tuesday, the same day as its initial release. It enjoyed a few good hours, before the site's functionality vanished: City officials appear to have cut off the sources of data that Walz was using to track parking enforcement.

“In rare lightning speed, the SF government changed their site within hours of this site going live,” reads an announcement Walz added to Find My Parking Cops on Tuesday afternoon. “I can't get data from it anymore.”

“Citations are a tool to ensure compliance with parking laws, which help keep our streets safe and use our limited curb space efficiently and fairly,” an SFMTA representative said in an emailed statement on Tuesday afternoon, after Walz's site was no longer functional. “We welcome creative uses of technology to encourage legal parking, but we also want to make sure that our employees are able to do their jobs safely, and without disruption.”

The idea for Find My Parking Cops was first sparked when Walz's roommate got a parking fine. Walz noticed the nine-digit identification number on the ticket and started looking for patterns. By using publicly available information, he believed he cracked the code.

“It seems each possible ticket number follows a pattern: add 11, except add 4 if the last digit is 6. So, no ticket can end in 7, 8, or 9,” Walz wrote in a blog post explaining the site. “So, the ticket after 984,946,606 is actually 984,946,610, and after that is 984,946,621.”

He suspected this absurd-seeming pattern was due to limitations baked into the software used by parking control officers. Whatever its reason for existing, the pattern of sequential ticket IDs, paired with parking officers likely claiming batches of ticket numbers, meant Walz was able to track their routes by plotting each parking ticket on a map as soon as it was entered into the system. A car owner could look at the activity of the officers currently out on patrol and see if any of them were slowly descending on their neighborhood.

Last year, parking officials in San Francisco issued over a million tickets within city limits, which amounted to over $100 million in fines for car owners. “I actually don't have a car, but I have plenty of friends that talk about it,” says Walz. Like most costs in San Francisco, these tickets can quickly add up. For example, forgetting to move your car during the weekly street sweeping—an error my household has made more than once—will cost you $90 every time.

The website's live updates were pulled from the city government's website and visualized on an Apple Map. Find My Parking Cops tracked the routes of individual parking control officers, giving them each unique visual identifiers, as well as their cadence of tickets.

On Tuesday, for example, the site displayed one officer seemingly starting their shift around 10:30 am and handing out 35 tickets over the next few hours as they patrolled a neighborhood in Lower Pacific Heights. The citations logged were primarily for expired meters, which costs $107 per ticket, and not having a residential permit, which costs $108 per ticket. In total, the fines racked up by that one officer over a few hours amounted to almost $4,000.

Who's handing out the most tickets each week? Walz included a leaderboard on the website that ranked just how much in fines each officer handed out. While officers were only identified on the map by a number and their initials, their cumulative ticket cost was tracked. When WIRED was last able to check Walz's website on Tuesday, the top fine giver had issued 157 tickets so far, handing out over $16,000 in fees for violations.

Prior to Find My Parking Cops, Walz created another San Francisco–specific website. This one used a phone, placed on a street corner in the Mission District, to identify what songs people were listening to in public. He then uploaded a live feed of the songs, captured and identified through the Shazam app, onto the Bop Spotter website. It provided a little peek into what neighborhood residents were bumping at the time while also slyly nodding at the abundance of surveillance in the city. He's also previously built a site, called IMG_0001, to surface old YouTube clips uploaded by everyday people in the platform's early days. Those grainy, private videos stand in stark contrast to the stuff that dominates the platform today.

The parking ticket tracker was another side project for Walz. “I worked in my free time on the weekends the last few weeks to make it happen,” he says.

While Walz's websites sometimes come with a dose of social commentary, he didn't envision this project as making some kind of grand, sweeping statement about parking tickets or what it means to drive in 2025. Rather, it's another entry in his repertoire of cool websites powered by unique data sources.

“I'm not ‘pro' parking cop. I'm not ‘anti' parking cop,” says Walz. “It's just data I was able to unearth, and I thought it would be cool to visualize it.”

And now it's gone. Representatives for Apple did not respond to immediate requests for comment. I reached out to Walz after the city's data feed was cut off, but he didn't pick up.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, or CCHFV, is a biosafety level 4 pathogen and a Category A bioterrorism agent, causing severe viral hemorrhagic fever with mortality rates reaching up to 40%. Already endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and much of Asia, the virus has recently expanded to Western Europe, carried by ticks on migratory birds. There is currently no approved vaccine or specific antiviral therapy for CCHFV.

Scott Pegan, a professor of biomedical sciences at the University of California, Riverside School of Medicine, has now been awarded a grant from the National Institutes of Health of about $3.4 million over five years to lead an international study focused on developing protective antibodies against CCHFV.

Designated a priority pathogen by the World Health Organization and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, CCHFV is considered the reference virus for the nairovirus genus, which includes emerging pathogens such as Benji, Songling, Wetland, Yezo, and the Pacific Coast tick nairovirus.

"The rapid geographic spread and severity of CCHFV infections call for urgent, coordinated research efforts," said Pegan, the principal investigator on the multi-institutional project that began this month. "This project will identify broadly protective antibody candidates that can be developed into potential therapies."

The research brings together an interdisciplinary and international team to tackle one of the world's most dangerous emerging viral threats. The team includes co-principal investigator Dr. Mohammad Sajadi, a professor of medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine; and co-investigators Aura Garrison and Joseph Golden, who are research microbiologists at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, a long-time leader in hemorrhagic fever virus research.

The project will study survivors of CCHFV in Kazakhstan, Turkey, and Uganda to find antibodies that protect against the virus. The team will also explore how the immune system fights the virus and work to develop monoclonal antibody treatments that are effective against different strains for future testing. A monoclonal antibody is a type of lab-made protein that mimics the immune system's ability to fight harmful viruses or bacteria.

By focusing on non-traditional viral targets, our approach could lead to new, life-saving therapeutics and help establish a framework for addressing future nairovirus outbreaks."

Other partners on the project include scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Uganda Virus Research Institute, Hitit University in Turkey, and South Kazakhstan Medical Academy.

Scientists at Université de Montréal's affiliated hospital research centre (CRCHUM) are testing out a mobile application to help young adults who have a first episode of psychosis to support safer cannabis consumption.

The nationwide clinical trial, a first in Canada, is led by Université de Montréal psychiatry and addictology professor Didier Jutras-Aswad, a researcher at CRCHUM.

Called CHAMPS (Cannabis Harm-reducing App to Manage Practices Safely), the pilot study is described in an article published in the August issue of Psychiatry Research.

The new study is backed by $800,000 in funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), specifically to evaluate the efficacy of the app.

Built in collaboration with young adults, clinicians and a number of experts, our app includes interactive modules and personalized support to reduce risks associated with cannabis consumption."

Didier Jutras-Aswad, head of the CHUM's Department of Psychiatry

"Our pilot study confirmed its acceptability among youth having experienced a first psychotic episode," he said. "The funding from the CIHR will allow us to further document the app's uses in diverse clinical contexts."

The pilot study was conducted with the support of a multidisciplinary team that included Stephanie Coronado-Montoya, the study's first author and former PhD student of Jutras-Aswad's, and Dr. Amal Abdel-Baki, a psychiatrist at CHUM, among others.

In all, 101 young adults, ranging from 18 to 35 years old, were monitored in six specialized early-intervention clinics for psychosis in Quebec and Nova Scotia.

The goal of the project is to provide an alternative to traditional care centred on abstinence and which is often inadequate for young adults who have experienced a first episode of psychosis and who do not plan to stop their cannabis consumption.

"When comparing standard care to an approach that includes CHAMPS, we can see that the app is well regarded and that it can be integrated into real clinical environments," said Jutras-Aswad. 

"Even if we cannot currently draw any conclusions about CHAMPS's efficacy, we have seen an encouraging signal in terms of a decrease in cannabis-related problems," he said.

Now he and his researcher team aim to expand their work to include 250 young adults and six clinics throughout Quebec, Nova Scotia and Alberta. Recruitment will take place over a three-year period.

CHAMPS is more than a phone app, its proponents say: it could easily be included in existing clinical care, without increasing workloads for medical personnel.

In fact, the researchers add, it exemplifies a new approach to mental health care, one that is specifically designed to meet the actual needs of an often neglected young adult population.

"Many people don't seek to, at least for a certain period of time, reduce or cease their cannabis use," said Jutras-Aswad. "But these young people are open to changing their consumption to reduce the risks to their health. This is what CHAMPS is for."

Designed in Montreal, the app could be adopted in countries where cannabis consumption is still illegal, he added. CHAMPS joins a larger movement that is working toward humanizing, personalizing and destigmatizing cannabis use in mental health care, he said.

"It's very important that we change perceptions, practices and philosophies in order to more broadly adopt harm reduction in mental health care," he emphasized.

To that end, in July, he and his team published several Recommendations for Reducing the Risk of Cannabis Use-Related Adverse Psychosis Outcomes, actively promoting their approach via an international group.

About 12 million adults in the United States are affected by PTSD, impacting between 4% and 8% of the adult population – and up to 30% of military personnel and veterans. Strikingly, 63% of veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder also suffer from alcohol use disorder (AUD) and/or chronic pain. These conditions frequently overlap, with individuals who have AUD or chronic pain often also experiencing PTSD.

When these disorders co-occur, they tend to worsen one another, making effective treatment significantly more challenging. Currently, no approved medications effectively treat PTSD and AUD together, and many available drugs come with serious side effects or limited results.

Researchers from Florida Atlantic University's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, in collaboration with the University of Oklahoma College of Pharmacy, conducted two complementary studies in rats to explore how a new drug, PPL-138, might help treat PTSD and its common companions – anxiety, chronic pain, and AUD. A type of opioid partial agonist, PPL-138 works by targeting specific opioid receptors in the brain.

Intellectual property related to PPL-138 is owned by Phoenix PharmaLabs, Inc. The company is in the process of advancing PPL-138 through clinical trials.

The first study, carried out at the University of Oklahoma, looked at whether long-term treatment with PPL-138 could reduce PTSD-related symptoms in chronic traumatic stress. The second study, conducted at FAU, focused on the relationship between trauma, anxiety and alcohol use, and researchers divided rats into different groups. 

Results, published in the British Journal of Pharmacology, provide promising evidence that PPL-138 could become a valuable treatment for PTSD and alcohol misuse – particularly when symptoms are rooted in anxiety. By targeting a brain system involved in both stress and addiction, researchers believe PPL-138 may one day offer a much-needed breakthrough for those struggling with these life-altering conditions.

Findings show that PPL-138 significantly reduced anxiety-like behavior, pain responses, and alcohol consumption – but only in rats that developed PTSD-like symptoms. In both male and female rats, the drug selectively reduced alcohol use in those that also showed signs of trauma-related anxiety, without affecting those that were resilient or not stressed.

Our results show that PPL-138 not only reduces trauma-related anxiety and pain, but also selectively curbs alcohol use in rats most vulnerable to stress-induced drinking. This kind of targeted treatment could transform how we manage PTSD and its comorbidities – especially for the large number of patients who currently fall through the cracks of existing therapies."

Andrea Cippitelli, Ph.D., lead author and assistant professor, Department of Biomedical Science within the Schmidt College of Medicine and member of the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute

The study findings also emphasize the need to consider sex differences in both the causes and treatment of these overlapping conditions. Among female rats, PPL-138 reduced alcohol intake in those exhibiting anxiety, even if their drinking had not escalated. This indicates that anxiety alone may be a primary factor driving alcohol use in females. 

"Anxious male rats were twice as likely as females to increase their alcohol intake following trauma, while nearly all female rats with more alcohol intake also displayed clear signs of anxiety," said Cippitelli. "This mirrors well-documented patterns in humans, where women are more prone to anxiety-related disorders like PTSD and often use alcohol to cope with emotional distress, whereas men typically engage in heavier, more generalized drinking."

Importantly, the effects of PPL-138 were not due to sedation or reduced activity. The compound did not alter movement or alcohol consumption in rats with anxiety-related behaviors or traumatic stress. In fact, movement levels remained unchanged in male rats and slightly increased in females – supporting the idea that the drug acts specifically on stress- and anxiety-related behaviors, rather than causing general suppression or sedation.

"This research represents a much-needed step toward helping both civilians and veterans living with the invisible wounds of trauma," said Cippitelli. "In our preclinical studies, PPL-138 shows strong potential as a single therapy for the overlapping symptoms of PTSD, chronic pain, and alcohol misuse – offering a potentially safer and more effective alternative to current multi-drug approaches."

Study co-authors are Yong Zhang, Ph.D., University of Oklahoma College of Pharmacy; Kyle Kealoha, a Ph.D. student in the FAU Department of Biomedical Science; Ali Idriss, former research lab technician, FAU Department of Biomedical Science; Panini S.

The diagnosis and medical treatment of Alzheimer's disease, a condition that according to leading researchers in the field should be treated, has now advanced significantly. A series of articles in The Lancet provides both a comprehensive and thorough review of current research.

This is a clear statement, and a wake-up call for Sweden. We have reached a stage where Alzheimer's disease is no longer something you can do little about. We must now implement the new diagnostic methods and the new medicines, and change the healthcare system.”

Henrik Zetterberg, professor of neurochemistry, University of Gothenburg

The articles published early Tuesday constitute of “The Lancet Series on Alzheimer's disease" and summarize the current state of Alzheimer's research worldwide. Henrik Zetterberg is co-author of two of the three articles.

The series describes the history of research, the major discoveries, controversies along the way, and the current consensus among the majority of scientists in the world that the pathology of the disease, with high levels of amyloid and tau proteins in the brain, is initiating the condition.

Similarly, there is a consensus that people undergoing memory assessments should be offered a finger prick so that their blood can be analyzed for biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, preferably at an early stage when memory and mental abilities still only reveal mild symptoms.

“The debate is whether the new clinical tests are adequate, and whether the new medicines have a clinically meaningful effect. The answer to these questions is yes, the tests are adequate, and the medicines are useful and should be used, as long as the risk of side effects, such as cardiovascular disease, is properly managed,” says Henrik Zetterberg.

The EU has approved the medicinal products lecanemab and donanemab, which slow the progression of mild dementia in Alzheimer's disease by removing amyloid plaques in the brain. Since the approval, different countries in the EU have progressed to different degrees. Swedish healthcare is waiting for regulatory approval before the medicines can start being used.

Meanwhile, more and more blood samples for Alzheimer's testing are being taken during basic memory assessments in Swedish primary care, as a complement to cognitive tests and assessments of physical and mental health, including interventions to rule out, for example, stress, depression or brain tumor.

In Henrik Zetterberg's research and laboratory environment at Sahlgrenska University Hospital Mölndal, the influx of Alzheimer's blood tests for analysis has increased in number in recent months alone:

“Every week we run perhaps 40-50 samples, primarily from Sweden and from different parts of the country, and I expect that to increase significantly this fall,” he says.

This does not concern screening, Zetterberg emphasizes, but routine care for patients who seek help because they sense that their memory and mental abilities are failing. One of his Lancet articles describes the development within Alzheimer's diagnosis as a revolution.

“It is great that we have it implemented in Sweden; we are at the clinical cutting edge. The fact that we do not yet have the medicines available is annoying and ethically problematic to say the least. The Lancet articles take a stand, stating that we now have something that actually looks good, and we can put the discussion about the benefits behind us,” concludes Henrik Zetterberg.

Scientists have mapped underappreciated scaffolding cells in skin, known as fibroblasts. They show for the first time how fibroblasts go 'rogue' in many different diseases affecting multiple organs – from acne and psoriasis, to rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.

Researchers at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, the Universities of Cambridge and Newcastle, and their collaborators combined single-cell sequencing and spatial genomics datasets with machine learning to identify eight different types of fibroblasts. They show how the fibroblasts form distinct 'tissue neighborhoods' in skin and reveal their shared functions in a range of diseases across various tissues.

Published today (24 September) in Nature Immunology, the researchers suggest that fibroblasts show potential as universal drug targets due to their involvement in multiple diseases across a range of tissues.

This study is part of the international Human Cell Atlas (HCA) consortium, which is mapping all human cells to understand human health, and help diagnose, monitor, and treat disease.

Skin is the largest organ in the body and plays an essential role in protecting us from infections. Two in three British people will suffer from skin disease at some point in their lifetime. Skin diseases account for 24 per cent of the UK's burden of illness, with wound care costing the NHS approximately £8.3 billion annually, and other skin conditions and diseases costing approximately £723 million each year.

Scaffolding cells, known as fibroblasts, are found in skin and every other organ in the body. They are involved in wound healing, scarring, tissue repair, the development of connective tissues and maintenance of skin.

Until now, skin fibroblasts have been somewhat overlooked, partly because their diversity has been difficult to study. While it is known that fibroblasts increase their collagen production and develop muscle-like fibres to contract after wounding, it has been unclear how fibroblast states change across the many diseases observed in skin, from cancers to acne.

Understanding the true diversity of fibroblasts and where they are located in tissues, in both health and disease, presents enormous clinical opportunities due to their roles in scarring and inflammation.

In a new study, Sanger Institute researchers and their collaborators set out to map fibroblasts in human skin, from healthy skin samples and 23 skin disorders, including psoriasis, lupus, skin cancers and acne.

The team generated spatial transcriptomic data – which measures gene expression and how it varies across different locations within a tissue – to spatially map the identified fibroblast populations from normal and diseased human skin.

The researchers found that these scaffolding cells are far more complex than was previously thought. The team discovered five different types of fibroblasts in healthy skin, which are located in distinct 'tissue neighbourhoods' associated with specific functions. Following this, the team looked at fibroblasts and their 'tissue neighbourhoods' in many other organs, including the endometrium, gut and lung in 14 diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and lung cancer. The team identified fibroblast populations shared across organs.

Using machine learning models, they identified three 'rogue' subtypes of fibroblasts that are present in different organs across multiple diseases, including scarring diseases and lung cancer, rheumatoid arthritis in joints and inflammatory bowel disease in the gut.

Interestingly, the researchers found that the same activated fibroblasts that recruit immune cells to early skin wounds were observed in inflammatory diseases, such as acne and inflammatory bowel disease. This suggests that a wound-like fibroblast state is used to attract immune cells to tissues in diseases like acne and inflammatory bowel disease, which both have a risk of scarring.

By identifying shared disease-related and disease-specific fibroblasts within these 'tissue neighbourhoods' across multiple diseases and organs, the researchers identify potential universal drug targets. This means researchers may be able to develop single drugs that work for several diseases across the body.

In the future, the team aims to extend this research to many other cell types across all of the tissues in the human body, and use machine learning and artificial intelligence to find disease-specific 'tissue neighbourhoods' that can be modulated for therapy.

Fibroblasts have critical roles in recruiting immune cells to skin tissue and causing scarring, which can result in a range of skin diseases. We lack highly effective treatments to treat scarring in clinical practice, partly because these cells have been poorly understood. Modern technologies now allow us to begin to understand these critical cells in unprecedented detail. We've shown for the first time that fibroblasts occupy and maintain distinct anatomical microenvironments in skin tissue in health and disease. Our data are freely available and we provide an online tool that can be used by researchers to map fibroblasts from their own studies, to expand our knowledge on fibroblasts in disease."

Dr. Lloyd Steele, first author at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and University of Cambridge

Dr Mo Lotfollahi, senior author and Group Leader at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: "Artificial Intelligence is going to be transformative in how we do science in the next 10 years, and guide how we explore vast datasets and make sense of complexities of the human body. Here we used machine learning to classify and map fibroblasts in healthy skin and many different diseases. In the future, we could use AI to query all of the different diseases affecting all of the different cell types in the various tissues across the body, to build a complete picture of what happens in health and disease."

This discovery highlights the kind of innovative research that can change the way we treat skin disease and beyond. Identifying a universal drug target in scaffolding cells found across the body opens the door to treatments that could benefit millions, and we're proud to support the researchers making this possible."

Matthew Patey, OBE, Chief Executive Officer at British Skin Foundation

Professor Muzz Haniffa, lead author and Head of Cellular Genomics at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, and Professor of Dermatology and Immunology at Newcastle University, said: "The clinical relevance of our work is huge – it is paradigm-shifting in terms of how we move from understanding the role of individual cell types to uncovering how disease-specific cell types form 'tissue neighbourhoods' that mediate inflammation. We find the same disease-related fibroblasts involved in several diseases across the body – atopic eczema, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis – meaning we could find universal therapeutic targets in these cells to treat many diseases. This could save time and money in drug development, and reduce side effects for patients."

Dawn  Attride

 September 24, 2025  

In Cleveland's humid summer heat, Michal Gostkowski, DO, doesn't need a jacket. In fall, perhaps a light coat. As winter's cold bite creeps in, he'll be sure to bundle up.

Just like changing outerwear when the weather shifts, the brains of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) sometimes need adjusting throughout the day. That's the idea behind a newly cleared adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) device now being used to treat PD, said Gostkowski, neurologist at Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland. As the patient's brain and symptoms fluctuate throughout the day, aDBS adjusts in real time, offering tailored control.

While conventional DBS (cDBS) has been a cornerstone treatment for nearly 30 years, it has clear limitations. cDBS delivers constant, fixed electrical stimulation to targeted brain regions but can't adjust to symptom fluctuations or the effects of medication. This can result in significant side effects, including dyskinesia.

In contrast, aDBS is a closed-loop system that offers a personalized alternative. By monitoring brain activity in real time and adjusting stimulation dynamically, this next-generation technology delivers greater symptom control with fewer side effects.

Neurologists in North America, Europe, and Asia are adopting the therapy to help preserve patients' independence and function, offering hope for millions living with the disease.

The response, so far, has been promising. Of Gostkowski's 75 patients using aDBS, to date, none has discontinued the therapy.

“This has been very advantageous for most patients,” Gostkowski told Medscape Medical News. “It just seems to provide what the body is missing, what the brain's not doing by itself, and patients really like it.”

In February, manufacturer Medtronic received FDA clearance for BrainSense aDBS and the BrainSense Electrode Identifier system, making it the first and only aDBS system cleared for clinical use in PD.

The approval was the culmination of more than a decade of research into refining aDBS — from determining which brain wave frequencies correlate to Parkinson's motor symptoms to further identifying which signals were safe and effective enough to drive the aDBS system.

In 2018, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), first implanted aDBS in two patients with PD, demonstrating that it was as effective at controlling symptoms as cDBS.

The procedure involves inserting electrodes into the brain and implanting a battery-powered pulse generator under the collarbone. The implanted leads are placed deep into the tiniest brain structures including the subthalamic nucleus where they pick up local field potentials. Within these signals, abnormal beta-band frequencies in the 13-30 Hz range activate the aDBS system.

Stimulation then modulates the disrupted beta waves in patients with PD, helping to alleviate certain motor symptoms.

A pivotal clinical trial — ADAPT-PD — led by Helen Bronte-Stewart, MD, MS, professor of neurology at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, served as the basis for FDA clearance of the technology.

The results of this 2020 multicenter, prospective, single-blind, randomized crossover trial were published in JAMA Neurology this week. Among the study's 68 participants (70.6% men; mean age, 62.2 years; disease duration, 13.5 years), most had effective “on” time (defined as time when symptoms were well controlled) without experiencing troublesome dyskinesia compared with cDBS.

“More than two thirds of study participants indicated a ‘strong' or ‘somewhat' preference for aDBS over their previous cDBS settings for improved motor symptoms or fewer symptom fluctuations,” the investigators wrote.

There needs to be sufficient beta power close to the electrode to drive the system, Bronte-Stewart told Medscape Medical News. “If there isn't enough of a signal recordable, then adaptive deep brain stimulation won't work, and that often depends on where the lead is in the brain,” she said.

Selecting patients with realistic expectations is key with aDBS, Gostkowski emphasized. Older patients and those with preexisting gait and speech problems are at a greater risk for stimulation-induced side effects, said Martijn Beudel, MD, PhD, neurologist and associate professor at Amsterdam University Medical Center (UMC) in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

In addition, patients with significant cognitive impairment or dementia are typically ineligible because the surgery itself may pose risks. Nonmotor symptoms of PD — such as swallowing difficulties, drooling, or blood pressure regulation — are not improved with this technology.

Some patients hope for improvements in memory or freezing of gait, Gostkowski noted, but these symptoms are unlikely to respond, which can lead to confusion about what aDBS can, and cannot, achieve. 

Rand Laycock, a 70-year-old music conductor who had been using cDBS to treat his PD, was a good fit for aDBS, Gostkowski said. Since Laycock switched from cDBS to the adaptive system earlier this year, the impact has been profound.

“My tremor is almost all gone, except if I experience extreme anxiety or stress — and my dyskinesia is pretty well under control,” Laycock said in a Cleveland Clinic patient profile. “My symptoms are minimal compared to the way they were, and a lot of that is due to the adaptive deep brain stimulation.”

In fact, aDBS has enabled him to continue his 47-year career on the podium.

Clinical data reinforce such patient-reported outcomes. A recent study led by UCSF researchers showed that aDBS improved symptoms and quality of life in patients with PD while reducing common side effects of cDBS.

Patients like Laycock who transition to aDBS require no further surgery — the Medtronic's Percept DBS system can be updated via software to activate its adaptive setting.

Although patients with the Percept device installed can technically update to aDBS, that doesn't always mean they should.

“It takes a long time to set someone in an adaptive DBS mode, and the juice may not be worth the squeeze for many patients with well-placed DBS leads,” Michael Okun, MD, medical advisor for the Parkinson's Foundation and author of the book The Parkinson's Plan, told Medscape Medical News in an email.

Bronte-Stewart chimed a similar note. She cautioned against framing aDBS as a revolutionary alternative that patients must have. Rather, she said, it should be viewed as a personalized biological therapy vs an entirely new treatment.

Worldwide, more than 160,000 patients with PD have DBS implants, though it's unclear how many are using aDBS. However, Medtronic reports that to date, over 40,000 people globally have the Percept device.

“The exact number of clinics using aDBS is still small. The barriers for implementation include the need for clinician training, the complexity of programming, and insurance reimbursement hurdles,” Okun said.

In the US, the cost of DBS ranges from $70,000 to $100,000. Gostkowski and Brett Youngerman, MD, neurosurgeon and assistant professor of neurological surgery at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City, said that their patients with PD have had no issues getting insurance coverage for the treatment.

Across the pond in Netherlands, Beudel has been busy rolling out aDBS to his patients.

His team began using aDBS in routine clinical practice in 2021, initially through the ADAPT-PD trial, and has since expanded its use to roughly 20 patients this year.

He noted that patients currently require slightly more frequent hospital visits than those with cDBS, primarily for algorithm adjustments. However, in his experience, aDBS offers superior management of stimulation-induced side effects, including dysarthria, dyskinesia, and gait disturbances.

“We have the advantage that we stimulate less than with cDBS, so it's less prone for side effects. Of course, we need to be very cautious when titrating the aDBS algorithms because we need to make sure that the stimulation is switching on based on a physiological signal that correlates with the symptoms of the patient,” he told Medscape Medical News.

Given the recent rollout of this technology, Beudel stressed the importance of learning from other clinicians and establishing an international registry of centers using aDBS. So far, 26 centers across Europe, the US, and Japan have joined the consortium with the goal of sharing patient outcome data and clinical insights.

Another advantage of aDBS is its longer battery life. Because it doesn't stimulate the brain continuously, UCSF researchers found that it can conserve about 40% more power than cDBS. The battery requires monthly recharging but retains capacity for roughly 12 years — far outlasting most cell phones.

However, there are still key aspects of aDBS that experts believe need further refinement. “The main limitation right now is that it's limited to a single predefined biomarker primarily focused on beta power,” Youngerman, who also reported beneficial outcomes from aDBS among his 25 patients, told Medscape Medical News.

The current commercial device remains first generation, but future iterations are expected to incorporate more sophisticated algorithms capable of interpreting additional neural signals as scientific understanding advances, said Bronte-Stewart.

aDBS is also being explored as a potential treatment for other neurologic disorders and certain psychiatric conditions.

The next step for aDBS is greater integration of artificial intelligence (AI), which could make the system more autonomous and reduce hospital visits by allowing the stimulation to self-titrate, Beudel said.

Remote monitoring tools are also in development, potentially allowing clinicians to access a patient's aDBS data remotely and further reduce the need for clinic visits. Postmarket studies are planned, and early registries are being established, though results will likely take a year or more to emerge, Okun noted.

“The next-generation systems with AI-driven algorithms and better user interfaces are on the horizon. I'm excited. However, we must simplify programming and ensure broader access to make it a true game changer for Parkinson's care,” he said.

But for now, aDBS appears to be making a meaningful difference for patients with PD in the US and abroad. Gostkowski's patient Rand described the therapy as “a life-changing procedure that allows you to become your own self again.”

Youngerman and Gostkowski reported having no relevant financial disclosures. Beudel reported receiving research funding from the Amsterdam UMC TKI-PPP grant (2021 and 2023 call), the EU Joint Programme-Neurodegenerative Disease Research project (2021 call), Stichting ParkinsonFonds (2023 and 2025 call), and Medtronic (2023-2025), all paid to the institution. Bronte-Stewart and Okun reported having no relevant disclosures.

A study shows that people with higher levels of the protein albumin in their urine are at increased risk of developing dementia. The study, led by researchers at Karolinska Institutet, is published in the scientific journal Journal of Internal Medicine.

Although age remains the biggest risk factor for developing dementia, researchers have increasingly shown that diseases in other parts of the body, such as the kidneys, can also affect the brain.In the new study, the researchers were able to show that people with higher levels of albumin in their urine, an abnormal condition known as albuminuria (see fact box), are at increased risk of developing dementia later in life.This association was strongest for vascular dementia, the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, often caused by stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, or other vascular diseases, and for mixed dementia, which combines features of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.The study included 130,000 older adults in Stockholm, all over the age of 65 and free of dementia at the start of the study. During a follow-up period of approximately four years, seven percent of the participants developed dementia.After taking into account kidney function and other factors, the researchers found that people with moderate levels of the protein albumin in their urine (30-299 mg/g) had a 25 percent higher risk of developing dementia, while those with high levels (≥300 mg/g) had a 37 percent higher risk compared to people with normal levels (<30 mg/g).Higher levels of this protein indicate kidney damage and, according to this study, may also signal a higher risk of dementia.

The kidneys and the brain may seem like very different organs, but they share an important characteristic: both depend on a delicate network of small blood vessels. When the blood vessels in the kidneys are damaged, the same process often occurs in the brain."

Hong Xu, last author, assistant professor at the Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society at Karolinska Institutet

An important component is the blood-brain barrier, a protective layer that prevents harmful substances in the blood from entering the brain. Just as a damaged kidney filter leaks proteins into the urine, a damaged blood-brain barrier allows toxins and inflammatory molecules to the brain tissue. Over time, this increases the risk of vascular damage, inflammation, and accumulation of harmful proteins linked to dementia."These results underscore the importance of routine screening for albuminuria as part of early dementia risk assessment, especially in patients with high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or kidney disease. Early detection of albuminuria could potentially delay or prevent the onset of dementia," says Hong Xu.The study was funded by the Center for Innovative Medicine Foundation (CIMED), the Swedish Research Council, the U&L Angeby Foundation, the Petrus and Augusta Hedlund Foundation, and the Åke Wiberg Foundation, among others.

In the first study of its kind, scientists show that far-UV light can cut airborne allergen levels by a quarter in just half an hour, opening the door to safer breathing spaces for millions with asthma and allergies.

Study: Far UV Exposure (UV222) Decreases Immune-Based Recognition of Common Airborne Allergens. Image credit: Nor Gal/Shutterstock.com

Airborne allergens, or aeroallergens, can cause respiratory allergies and asthma. A recent study in ACS ES&T Air examined the impact of far-ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the immunogenicity of several common aeroallergens, hoping to find a preventative intervention.

One in three Americans suffers from allergies, and these conditions cause multiple severe illnesses worldwide. Airborne allergens, often occurring as indoor aerosols, are a significant cause of such allergies. They also trigger asthma, which affects 262 million people globally, with 1,000 deaths a day.

Common aeroallergens are proteins associated with dust mites, cats and dogs, mice, rats, fungi (e.g., Aspergillus), and plants. In most cases, they trigger an immune response that causes allergic reactions, though non-proteins are sometimes involved.

Specific regions of the protein's three-dimensional structure form recognition and binding sites to which immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies attach, setting off the inflammatory-allergic cascade. These regions are termed epitopes.

Current control strategies include preventive measures, medication, and engineering adaptations. Aeroallergens are, however, unique in their ability to persist indoors for years. There are no standardized methods to detect and monitor them to understand exposure-response relationships or the effectiveness of preventive measures. As a result, researchers often rely on indirect indicators, such as mold spore or pollen counts, instead of measuring the allergens themselves. Alternatively, settled dust is tested rather than airborne dust.

Therefore, our understanding of real-world exposure is limited, as in plants that make latex gloves, laboratories that use animals, plants that produce detergent enzymes, or those that process grain. These may expose workers to aeroallergen concentrations above 10 ng/m3, an allergy-inducing threshold.

Current preventive strategies are typically too intensive to be sustainable. Practical and multipronged interventions are needed to tackle allergens in the respired air and settle dust effectively.

The current study examines the effectiveness of UV at 222 nm bandwidth (UV222) in reducing aeroallergens. Conventional ultraviolet therapy uses the 254 nm band, which is genotoxic and thus destroys microbes. However, this can damage the human eyes and skin and is not suitable for lived-in spaces without extensive protection.

Conversely, UV222 inactivates microbes. It is highly absorbed by proteins, causing photooxidation and structural damage. However, its limited penetration power makes it safer on the skin and eyes. The current study targets using far-ultraviolet light UV222 as an occupant-safe treatment to reduce aeroallergens.

The researchers developed a controlled chamber model containing 10 m3 of air. They generated airborne allergens within the chamber using those commonly linked to patient sensitization, allergy, and asthma. The chamber was set to a relative humidity of 60% since allergens derived from mold and dust mites thrive in such an environment.

The allergens used included:

Aeroallergens were introduced from either dustborne or purified sources. The aeroallergen-bearing particles in the air were then collected and measured. The particle size distribution was also checked for allergen enrichment at any fraction.  

UV222 exposure of the whole chamber was provided. Still, it was set below the threshold for skin and eye exposure, as per the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) standards. Ozone levels generated by the radiation were also monitored.

As expected, over 99% of aeroallergens in the experimental chamber were 10 µm or smaller. No single allergen was concentrated within any particle size range. Interestingly, some aeroallergens were more stable in the air than others, likely due to intramolecular interactions and interactions with the surrounding environment. Future research should examine how this stability influences the risk of inhalation.

Allergen levels at baseline were about 50-200 ng/m3 in the controls and the UV chamber, reflecting clinically observed respirable air allergen levels. UV222 irradiation significantly reduced the average aeroallergen load by 20% to 25%. Most of the reduction occurred within 30 minutes of treating the air.

Comparing all aeroallergens, dustborne allergens decreased faster, on average, than airborne ones, after UV222 treatment. The most significant reduction was seen with the birch allergen Bet v 1. The least affected was Fel d 1, from dustborne and purified sources. However, it became much more vulnerable to UV222 after stabilizing components like Tween-20 were removed from the purified airborne form.

The finding of borderline significant ozone exposure levels indicates the need for ozone monitoring during ultraviolet irradiation in confined conditions. However, the ozone generated during the experiment did not significantly reduce allergen levels.

Not only did clinically relevant reductions in aeroallergen loads occur, but they occurred within feasible time periods. Regarding allergen decrease, the reductions are comparable to those reported in long-term allergy studies, though the paper stresses that clinical outcomes were not directly tested here.

The authors interpret these results cautiously, suggesting that UV222 likely disrupts protein structure and reduces immunoassay detection of allergens, which may also reduce IgE-epitope recognition in the body, but this requires further study.

This is the first study to use common aeroallergens in a controlled setting at concentrations similar to real-world allergy-causing levels in the air. These new methods should help understand airborne allergens' movement and availability in respired air. They could thus help in framing effective interventions and preventive measures.

“These findings suggest that UV222 exposure can reduce allergen immunorecognition within respirable particles, supporting its use as an integrated strategy for indoor aeroallergen control.” Further research is required to understand how this is associated with a clinically relevant reduction in symptoms in sensitized or allergic individuals.

In an experiment with 129 women, researchers discovered that foodie Instagram content lifted mood while clean eating posts failed to do so and hinted at subtle risks for body satisfaction.

Study: Food and mood: how clean eating content on social media influences affect and body satisfaction in women. Image credit: 9919/Shutterstock.com

A recent study in Frontiers in Psychology compared the impact of social media content on clean eating vs eating-related control content (foodie) on its effect, body satisfaction, and food choices in a behavioral task.

Spending more time on social media has been associated with lower body satisfaction and disordered eating among users. Instagram, a popular picture-based social media outlet, is used by more than 28% of global internet users. Recently, researchers have started to assess the impact of food- and eating-related social media posts on individuals' perceptions of their bodies and eating behaviors.

Social media users share eating-related content by posting nutritional tips, food photography, and eating videos. A previous study presented an association between viewing eating-related content and eating disorder symptoms, and negative body image.

Clean eating (CE) is an eating-related trend with thousands of Instagram posts containing the hashtags #healthyfood and #healthylifestyle. Although there is no universal definition of CE, it is commonly described as an eating behavior characterized by a higher intake of non-processed foods. The concept of CE aligns with avoiding food considered “bad” (e.g., refined sugar and alcohol) and encouraging “good” (e.g., fruits and vegetables) with a strict diet.

Although the concept of CE could initially benefit health, restricting the variety and quantity of food may lead to disordered eating and promote a negative body image. Social media content has been found to trigger body dissatisfaction and appearance-ideal internalization, particularly among females between 18 and 30 years of age. Women between 17 and 55 years of age, who followed CE recommendations, were more likely to develop restrictive eating behavior, commonly in the form of orthorexia nervosa.

In addition to CE, food content has also increased on Instagram, showcasing what people eat and cook, and often uses hashtags such as #foodporn. Not many studies have investigated the impact of consuming food-related content on body satisfaction and mood. Considering the high volume of social media content related to food, it is essential to understand how it affects an individual's mood, body satisfaction, and behavior.

The current randomized study employed a 2 × 2 design (profile: clean eating vs. foodie; between-subjects factor) × 2 (time: pre-post; within-subjects factor). It assessed the impact of exposure to CE and foodie content on Instagram. The current study hypothesized that viewing CE Instagram profiles would enhance negative affect (NA) and decrease positive affect (PA) and body satisfaction, compared to viewing control content; that CE would lead to healthier snack choices; and that participants with higher baseline vulnerabilities (eating disorder or orthorexia symptoms, body dissatisfaction) would react more strongly.

Female students from the University of Konstanz, primarily from the psychology department, were enrolled to evaluate PA and NA before and after exposure to content from two profiles: CE and control (foodie content) created on Instagram for this study. Each Instagram profile contained 16 posts and was comparable in terms of interaction and number of followers. These accounts were not accessible outside the study.

Any participant with substance dependence, the presence of severe depressive symptoms, a BMI lower than 17 or higher than 30, or those with suicidal tendency were excluded. Eligible participants completed a pre-questionnaire and were randomly assigned to two experimental conditions. After viewing the profile, participants were asked to complete the post-questionnaire. Subsequently, they were asked to select a snack from various foods.

Orthorexic behavior was assessed using the Düsseldorf Orthorexia Scale (DOS), while the Body Image States Scale (BISS) was used to determine an individual's self-evaluation of their physical appearance. These trait measures were used as moderators, not as outcomes.

A total of 129 women (CE-64 and Control-65) fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Participants of both groups were of similar age, body mass index (BMI), eating disorder symptoms, orthorexia symptoms, or general psychopathology. The CE and control groups exhibited similar hunger ratings and time since their last meal.

No significant PA on profile exposure was observed. However, a significant effect of time was observed, with a reduction in PA from before to after exposure across the group. A significant interaction of time × profile was found regarding NA. A significant reduction in NA was observed from pre- to post-measurement when participants viewed the control profile. However, no significant changes were noted in participants after viewing the CE profile. This suggests foodie content may have a protective effect on mood, whereas CE content maintained negative affect.

A higher BISS score indicates lower body satisfaction. Interestingly, an interaction effect between profile and time was observed, but simple tests showed no clear changes within either group. Thus, while no significant body satisfaction changes were confirmed, there was tentative evidence that CE exposure may contribute to lower body satisfaction. Notably, this effect appeared even though no bodies were shown in the posts, suggesting that “healthy lifestyle” food content alone may influence body image.

In the CE group, only 20.31% of the participants selected a healthy food, while the majority chose a high-calorie snack, with two participants declining any snack. Similarly, only 25% of the participants from the foodie group selected a healthy food, while the majority chose high-calorie snacks.

Regression analyses showed that pre-existing vulnerabilities (orthorexia symptoms, eating disorder symptoms, or body dissatisfaction) did not predict stronger reactions to CE content, contrary to the hypothesis.

The current study highlighted the short-term effects of one-time consumption of CE content on social media. Neither CE nor control profile exposure impacted food choice, and body satisfaction effects were inconclusive but showed tentative signals of harm for CE. However, it is not conclusive whether social media content increases the risk of eating disorders or orthorexia symptoms.

Importantly, foodie content reduced negative affect, suggesting that food-enjoyment-focused posts have a protective effect on mood compared to health-restrictive content. Future research must systematically validate this study's findings, especially with longer exposure times and more diverse samples.

The Family Heart Foundation, a leading research and advocacy organization, announced the online publication of recommendations from a multidisciplinary panel in the Journal of Pediatrics to promote the early identification of children living with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). A common life-threatening genetic condition that causes high cholesterol from birth, FH can lead to premature heart attacks and heart disease, if it is not diagnosed until adulthood. Despite national guidelines established in 2011 by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the prevalence of pediatric universal lipid screening remains low, leaving the majority of affected children in the United States at high risk of heart disease decades earlier than those who have not inherited the condition.

The manuscript, titled "Accelerating Guideline Recommended Universal Pediatric Lipid Screening: Launch of the LEAD Pediatric Initiative," highlights strategies that could lead to improved universal guideline-recommended screening implementation. The Family Heart Foundation established the Leveraging Evidence and Data (LEAD) for Pediatric Cholesterol Screening Initiative last year to address current challenges that serve as friction points in providing life-saving screening. The Family Heart Foundation engaged national experts and leveraged feedback from the FH population in the U.S. to identify barriers and develop evidence-based recommendations to improve universal lipid screening outcomes from the perspectives of patients/families, clinicians, and healthcare systems.

Every child in America between the ages of 9 and 11 years of age should get a simple blood test to screen their LDL cholesterol for a serious genetic condition called familial hypercholesterolemia. Many times, families do not understand that the cardiovascular disease that runs through their family for generations can be managed with early diagnosis. The publication in the Journal of Pediatrics lays out concrete actions that can be taken, and on which we have formed partnerships to support families and improve care for children."

Katherine Wilemon, founder and chief executive officer of the Family Heart Foundation

Data published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and in Pediatrics, indicates that only 11% of youth in the U.S. between the ages of 9 and 21 had documented lipid screening, and 30 to 60% of youth with dyslipidemia may be missed by targeted screening alone compared to universal lipid screening.

"Many clinicians do not understand the reason for pediatric lipid screening guidelines that were primarily developed to identify FH, a genetic condition designated by the World Health Organization in 1998 as a public health concern," said Laurence S. Sperling, MD, FACC, FACP, FAHA, MASPC, chief medical officer of the Family Heart Foundation, Katz professor in Preventive Cardiology at Emory University School of Medicine, and professor of Global Health at Rollins School of Public Health. "Early and aggressive cardiovascular disease can be prevented with an FH diagnosis in a child, leading to immediate and appropriate treatment. The goal of LEAD is to significantly impact missed opportunities to save hundreds of thousands of young lives from being cut short or burdened by early cardiovascular disease. The tools created by a working group representing patient, families, clinicians, and health systems as part of the Family Heart Foundation's LEAD initiative and outlined in the Journal of Pediatrics will increase understanding among clinicians and parents about the importance of universal screening."

The journal publication was simultaneously highlighted at the annual Family Heart Foundation Global Summit in Atlanta, in which the findings were shared with medical experts, policy makers, and industry leaders from around the world.

The trillions of microbes that live in the human gut may play a bigger role in health than previously thought, according to a new research by the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. The article, published in September 2025 in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, explores how gut bacteria interact with human genes in ways that could shape disease risk, aging and even future medical treatments.

The review highlights how the gut microbiome (the collection of bacteria, viruses and fungi that live in the digestive system) can affect epigenetics, the process that turns genes on or off without changing the DNA itself. These changes happen through chemical tags such as DNA or RNA methylation, which control when and how genes are expressed.

By understanding how gut microbes influence our genes, we can begin to imagine new ways to prevent disease and promote health in a way that gets us closer to personalized medicine."

Alika K. Maunakea, co-author of the study and professor, UH Mānoa John A. Burns School of Medicine

Everyday factors-such as diet, stress, medications and aging-can influence these microbial interactions. For example, gut bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids, nutrients and other chemical signals that may reprogram gene activity linked to immunity, metabolism or brain health. In turn, a person's lifestyle and genetic makeup can shape which microbes thrive in the gut, creating a feedback loop between humans and their microbes.

The researchers point to future possibilities where understanding this loop could help doctors design personalized treatments. Potential applications include using microbial biomarkers (biological signals that indicate health or disease), developing "live biotherapeutics" (beneficial bacteria given like medicine) or refining fecal microbiota transplants, which transfer gut microbes from healthy donors to patients. Advances in artificial intelligence and single-cell analysis are helping scientists model these complex relationships at an unprecedented scale.

The paper also stresses the importance of setting clear standards and ethical safeguards as this field develops. Frameworks such as the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable data) and CARE principles (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility and Ethics) are needed to ensure that data from microbiome research benefits diverse populations equitably.

By mapping out how gut microbes communicate with human genes, the review underscores both the promise and responsibility of this emerging science. The insights could open the door to precision health strategies that tailor prevention and treatment to each individual's unique microbial and epigenetic makeup.

Researchers from USC and Duke report that the persistent "know-do gap" - where clinicians know guidelines but practice differently - is the primary driver of antibiotic overprescribing for pediatric diarrhea in India's private sector, not lack of knowledge, point-of-sale profits, or stockouts of clinically recommended treatments such as oral rehydration salts (ORS).

In a sample of 2,282 private providers across 253 towns, 70 percent prescribed antibiotics without signs of bacterial infection, and among those who knew antibiotics were inappropriate, 62 percent still prescribed them to standardized patients, indicating a large know-do gap. The study found that eliminating the knowledge gap alone would cut inappropriate antibiotic use by about 6 percentage points, whereas closing the know-do gap could reduce it by roughly 30 percentage points.

Randomized experiments showed that the know-do gap was driven by providers' beliefs about patient preferences and not profits from selling antibiotics or limited supplies of ORS. When patients expressed a preference for ORS, inappropriate antibiotic use fell by 17 percentage points on average, with especially large reductions among pharmacies. By contrast, removing point-of-sale financial incentives and supplying ORS had no meaningful effect on antibiotic prescribing.

A discrete choice experiment with 1,189 caregivers further found that patients did not prefer providers who give antibiotics over those who provide ORS, underscoring the misalignment between provider perceptions and actual patient preferences.

Our data reveal a striking disconnect: clinicians know antibiotics are wrong for most diarrhea cases, yet prescribe them anyway because they think parents expect 'strong' medicines. Correcting that perception, rather than another training seminar, offers the biggest win for global antibiotic stewardship."

Zachary Wagner, corresponding author of USC's Center for Economic and Social Research

"A lot of children are given antibiotics when they don't need them, and that can lead to drug-resistant bacteria - a problem for the whole world, not just India. By showing that patient–provider communication trumps financial motives, we give policymakers a laser-focused lever: help doctors understand real patient preferences," added coauthor Neeraj Sood of the USC Schaeffer Center and Price School.

The authors note the largest know-do gaps among less formally trained providers and pharmacies, where preference signaling by patients yielded the biggest improvements, suggesting targeted interventions could deliver outsized benefits.

"Pharmacies and informal providers, often the first stop for care, showed the largest know-do gaps," noted Manoj Mohanan of Duke University. "Interventions that empower caregivers to voice a preference for ORS, or public campaigns signaling that parents don't demand antibiotics, could slash misuse at scale."

Funding for this research was provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (PI Wagner; 5R01DK126049).

Expanding access to lifestyle medicine education opportunities-such as continuing medical education (CME) courses, professional certification, webinars, mentoring and peer-to-peer connections, and conference participation-can facilitate the adoption of the medical specialty across health systems, according to a new study published in Translational Behavioral Medicine.

This qualitative study conducted by the American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) found that intentional educational strategies are critical to the adoption and growth of lifestyle medicine programming and facilitate deepening of clinicians' knowledge, skills, and confidence in delivering lifestyle medicine interventions to treat, reverse and prevent chronic disease.

These findings give health system leaders a roadmap of educational strategies to advance lifestyle medicine implementation. By investing in CME courses and conferences or creating space for informal activities like wellness programs and peer support, leaders have powerful levers that drive adoption and sustain long-term growth."

Micaela Karlsen, PhD, ACLM Senior Director of Research 

To understand how health systems prepare clinicians to practice lifestyle medicine, researchers conducted more than 60 interviews with clinicians, administrators and educators at eight health systems. Seven of these health systems are part of ACLM's Health System Council-a collaborative network dedicated to accelerating clinical integration of the specialty.

Interviewees identified several educational strategies that supported lifestyle medicine practice, including:

Interviewees described how educational initiatives translated into cultural and practice shifts within their organizations, also leading to mentoring and further peer support. The role of cultural support had been further explored in a previous ACLM study. One physician in the new study responded that after they earned lifestyle medicine certification, they "helped 15 other people, a few physicians and nurse practitioners" get board certified." At least two health systems established resources to support employees to achieve certification. 

Six health systems described leveraging lifestyle medicine and food as medicine conference attendance to support clinician education. Interviewees noted that the experience not only instilled a passion for lifestyle medicine but also inspired them to disseminate knowledge and insights within their organizations.

The study highlighted the benefit of embedding lifestyle medicine into employee wellness initiatives. These initiatives gave clinicians firsthand experience with the same lifestyle interventions recommended for patients, reinforcing both their confidence and credibility when delivering lifestyle medicine care. While pilot programs have long been recognized as an approach to test the feasibility of an intervention, the study's first author Meghan Ames, DrPH, MSPH, RDN, said "This work highlights that delivering lifestyle medicine to health system employees can serve as a rich opportunity for healthcare professionals to learn firsthand what lifestyle medicine is and how powerful it can be to impact health."

The study also pinpointed key educational content areas considered most critical: a clear definition and evidence base for lifestyle medicine, behavior change counseling, familiarity with lifestyle medicine referral opportunities and business operation skills.

Many of the strategies interviewees described focused on raising awareness of the lifestyle medicine resources available both inside and outside their health systems. This awareness was seen as critical for making patient referrals and ensuring consistent use of lifestyle medicine services. As one physician explained, "It's also important that the people you work with know about what existing resources are," adding that education must be continuous because "you'll always have new staff or new physicians joining."

New research presented at the 41st Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS 2025) demonstrates that ocrelizumab provides superior control of multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses compared with fingolimod, natalizumab, and alemtuzumab.

Ocrelizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20+ B cells, was evaluated using real-world data from three large MS registries: MSBase, OFSEP, and the Danish MS Registry. The analysis compared ocrelizumab-treated patients with cohorts receiving fingolimod (2,600 vs. 4,103 patients), natalizumab (3,197 vs. 2,437 patients), and alemtuzumab (2,960 vs. 644 patients), all with at least six months of treatment and follow-up.

In the fingolimod comparison, MS relapse rates were significantly lower with ocrelizumab (0.06 vs 0.14; p<0.001). Fingolimod patients had a more than twice the risk of relapse (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.98–2.58), a higher risk of relapse-associated worsening, and a lower likelihood of disability improvement.

Compared with natalizumab and alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab also showed lower relapse rates (0.07 vs 0.10 and 0.12 vs 0.18, respectively; both p<0.001). Additionally, ocrelizumab reduced the risk of relapse-associated worsening compared with natalizumab, while no such difference was observed compared with alemtuzumab.

While the differences between ocrelizumab and natalizumab or alemtuzumab were statistically significant, they were modest. For example, there was approximately one fewer relapse per 33 patient-years when comparing natalizumab to ocrelizumab. These differences were most pronounced in patients with recent disease activity, prior treatment failure, or those not treatment naïve."

Dr. Izanne Roos, lead author of the study

Adverse event data were not consistently available across registries. As a proxy for tolerability, the study examined treatment persistence. Only 8% of natalizumab patients and 6% of ocrelizumab patients discontinued treatment due to poor tolerability, suggesting both therapies are generally well-tolerated.

While ocrelizumab consistently reduced relapses and relapse-associated worsening, there was no evidence of differences in progression independent of relapse activity or disability improvement compared with the other high-efficacy therapies.

"These findings suggest we may have reached the ceiling of disability benefit achievable via relapse suppression alone, highlighting the urgent need for treatments that target relapse-independent progression," Dr. Roos concluded.

One day, bottles of probiotics might do more than keep you regular -- they could help prevent disease. To get there, a $2 million grant to UC Riverside will explore how gut bacteria shape human health.

Beyond your DNA and your lifestyle, your microbes play a huge role in shaping how your body reacts to illnesses and vaccines."

Ansel Hsiao, associate professor in UCR's Department of Microbiology and Plant Pathology and principal investigator of the grant

The award from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) will support Hsiao's lab in its quest to answer questions about how gut microbes communicate with each other and with their human hosts to influence health, or lack thereof. 

Probiotics currently sold in markets can have beneficial effects on regularity and bloating. However, their effects are limited, in part because they don't last long in the gut. 

"Though commercial probiotics are regarded as safe, they do not make people resilient to disease," Hsiao said. "They stick around for a day, maybe two. So, their beneficial effects rely on regular consumption."

With a better understanding of microbes' communication and behavior, Hsiao hopes his lab will one day create the next generation of probiotics and prebiotics that strengthen the gut microbiome, improve the effectiveness of vaccines, and prevent or lessen the severity of infections.

"One thing we can improve on with changing the gut microbiome, is making positive changes that last for extended periods of time," Hsiao said.

Bacteria are individual cells that operate independently, but they can produce chemical signals that other cells can sense, and that might influence the behavior of another bacterial cell. This is called quorum sensing, which is the idea that you can have many individuals cooperating on a single goal. 

"It's like a company that requires a certain number of people to conduct a meeting. You have to have a quorum for the meeting to proceed," Hsiao said. "Same idea with bacteria."

When many bacteria in the same host are making enough communication molecules, the whole population of individuals can behave almost like a multi-cellular organism. Some pathogenic bacteria, like the diarrheal disease cholera, use this type of communication to coordinate their activity and optimize their interactions with the host during infection. When it's multiplied to a high enough level, cholera bacteria signal to one another that it's time to move on to a new host.

In collaboration with clinical teams in Bangladesh, Hsiao's lab is also identifying bacterial profiles that correlate with stronger or weaker vaccine responses for diseases like cholera. By sequencing the gut bacteria present when a person is vaccinated, the team is beginning to predict who naturally develops immunity and who may need additional protection.

Though the cholera research is funded separately, the work could help explain why a cholera vaccine that's 99% effective in the U.S. drops to about 50% effectiveness in parts of South Asia. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that connect gut bacteria with each other and to the host's immune responses could extend the work from cholera to other diseases as well.

To probe these links under controlled conditions, Hsiao's team uses germ-free mice. These animals are raised without any bacteria or fungi. By introducing specific microbes, researchers can connect specific microbes to specific health outcomes.

"It's a powerful setup," Hsiao said. "We can see how a vaccine or disease-causing microbe performs when the gut contains only one bacterial species, or when it resembles a real human microbiome."

Some microbial differences are shaped by family or early-life exposure, but others come down to timing. The first bacteria to colonize a person's guts can determine whether new species are welcomed or excluded, a dynamic known as the priority effect. This level of variability makes standardized medical approaches more complicated. Even a widely used probiotic strain might benefit one person but do nothing for another.

The recent NIH grant enables long-term investigations into how individualized microbial ecosystems affect health, not just in response to vaccines, but in other areas including cognition, nutrition, and diarrheal infection.

"This kind of support is not tied to one project but to the broader questions we're pursuing," Hsiao said. "And the questions are urgent. If we can understand how to work with the microbiome instead of against it, we can transform public health."

Natural systems such as CRISPR-associated transposons (CASTs) offer a targetable, one-step way to edit genomes. However, adapting them for biomedical applications has been challenging. To address this limitation, scientists at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital designed a screening approach to measure efficiency and specificity for thousands of CAST variants accurately. This high-throughput approach allowed the researchers to rapidly optimize promising candidate CASTs, uncovering mechanistic insights fundamental for further engineering and potential clinical use. The findings were published today in Nucleic Acid Research.

Discovered in 2017, CASTs integrate large pieces of DNA into the genome at locations defined by a given RNA sequence. They are highly specific in bacteria, their natural host, but they do not work as well in human cells. 

For this reason, corresponding author Elizabeth Kellogg, PhD, St. Jude Department of Structural Biology, is keenly interested in engineering CASTs to be more applicable to humans and other organisms. To do so requires a quick way to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of engineered CASTs. 

One major gap in understanding CASTs was not just measuring their overall activity, but also how accurately they integrate DNA at the intended locations. There simply wasn't a scalable way to characterize their specificity."

Elizabeth Kellogg, PhD, St. Jude Department of Structural Biology

To address this gap, the researchers devised a high-throughput screen to measure the relative activity and specificity of thousands of CAST variants in a single experiment. By focusing on a single subtype - the V-K CAST, which is notably less complex than others - they were able to make slight alterations to its proteins and rapidly screen the mutants. 

"We wanted to screen a library with every possible single mutation to explore the mutational landscape of a CAST system," said co-first author Seong Guk Park, PhD, Department of Structural Biology. "We didn't focus on specific regions; instead, we tested them all to find mutations that could improve activity or specificity."

After the V-K CAST mutational screening, the researchers combined several of the most promising mutations to see if their positive effect was additive. "With just a few mutations, activity increased fivefold," Kellogg said. "We improved both specificity and activity without compromising either, which was not possible with previous strategies." 

Kellogg will continue working to improve the CAST design. With this screen now available, she is optimistic. "The natural system is very complicated, so we need to develop more minimal systems," Kellogg said. "But this screen now enables us to be more ambitious with our protein design so that we can ultimately achieve this goal."

The study's other first author is Jung-Un Park, University of California Berkeley and St. Jude. The study's other authors are Esteban Dodero-Rojas, John Bryant Jr., and Geetha Sankaranarayanan, St. Jude.

Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, part of University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, will co-lead a newly funded, multi-institutional clinical trial to evaluate whether artificial intelligence (AI) can help support radiologists in interpreting mammograms more accurately, with the goal of improving breast cancer screening and reducing unnecessary callbacks and anxiety for patients.

The study, known as the PRISM Trial (Pragmatic Randomized Trial of Artificial Intelligence for Screening Mammography), is supported by a $16 million award from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). The study will involve hundreds of thousands of mammograms interpreted at academic medical centers and breast imaging facilities in California, Florida, Massachusetts, Washington and Wisconsin. The AI support tool studied will be Transpara by ScreenPoint Medical with clinical workflow integration provided by the Aidoc aiOS platform.

As the first major randomized trial of AI in breast cancer screening in the U.S., this study represents a pivotal step. Our goal is to rigorously and objectively assess AI's impact - identifying who benefits and who may not. Radiologists remain firmly in control of all diagnostic decisions."

Jose Net, M.D., director of breast imaging services at Sylvester, associate professor of clinical radiology at the Miller School and co-principal investigator of the study

Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer death among women in the U.S. While routine mammography screening reduces mortality through early detection, it also has drawbacks - including false positives that can lead to unnecessary testing, anxiety and costs, and missed cancers.

"While AI offers substantial promise, it also prompts critical questions," said Net. "Our focus is on understanding whether AI genuinely enhances cancer detection by radiologists or simply leads to more false alarms."

What makes PRISM different is its emphasis on patient-centered research. The trial was developed in close partnership with patient advocates, clinicians, health system leaders and policymakers.

Each participating facility will continue routine screening as usual, with no changes to the patient experience. Mammograms will be randomly assigned to be interpreted either by a radiologist on their own or with assistance from an FDA-cleared AI support tool. In all cases, a radiologist reads the exam and makes the final decision.

"A trial of this magnitude focusing on AI in breast cancer screening has never been conducted in the U.S.," stated Net. "The findings will influence not only clinical practices but also insurance policies, technology integration, and patient interactions. According to Net, while there is significant optimism that AI will enhance health care, few rigorous studies have assessed its actual impact in real-world settings.

"This trial presents an opportunity to produce reliable evidence with a strong emphasis on the patient's perspective," he stated.

In addition to analyzing cancer detection and recall rates, the study will include focus groups and surveys to capture how patients and radiologists perceive and trust AI-assisted care.

The PRISM trial brings together seven leading academic medical centers:

Net emphasized that the goal is not to replace human expertise but to understand how AI might complement it. "Our skilled radiologists will always have the final say. While AI can serve as a helpful assistant, it is ultimately the radiologist who is in control."

The trial is expected to inform future policy decisions, best practices in screening, and how to most effectively integrate emerging technologies into patient care.

PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- As the city prepares to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup next summer, the School District of Philadelphia is launching a major initiative to support student soccer players across the city.

Ayana Lewis, executive director of the Office of Strategic Partnerships for the district, called the investment "amazing."

"We have the host committee and the USA World Soccer Foundation donating $405,000 to soccer programming, professional development, new soccer equipment, beautification projects - amazing investments in our young people," Lewis said.

The partnership will benefit 21 schools and hundreds of students, with support from FIFA and local soccer clubs aimed at helping young athletes elevate their game. Student athletes gathered Tuesday at the South Philly Super Site to celebrate the announcement, just steps from Lincoln Financial Field, where World Cup matches will be held.

"I think all of us collectively, we're just really excited for the World Cup, really excited to see the teams we support play together," said Angel Oburu, an 11th grader at Science Leadership Academy at Beeber.

Fatiamh Iprahiam, a 9th grader at SLA Beeber, added, "I'm so excited for the World Cup, and I'm so excited to hopefully meet my favorite player. I hope so."

Students from SLA Beeber expressed particular excitement about a new soccer field being built at their school, along with one at Olney High School.

"It's beneficial for me because we get a field to train on, so we can win more games," said Sally Doumbia, a 10th grader at SLA Beeber.

Oburu added, "I definitely feel like when we get the field, it's going to improve all of our stamina, our speed, how fast we are on the field, how we play - because getting on SEPTA is a really hard issue."

The investment also includes after-school and youth development programs focused on soccer skills, teamwork, and motivation.

Superintendent Dr. Tony Watlington emphasized the long-term impact of the initiative.

"Joy is one of the core values in our five-year aggressive strategic plan entitled Accelerate Philly," Watlington said. "And we expect to have lots of joy over the next year."

Students interested in joining a team still have time to participate by attending practice and showcasing their skills.

Antony was the inspiration for Real Betis with two key contributions to deny Forest on their long-awaited return to European competition in Seville. His dramatic equaliser came with five minutes remaining, following his assist for Cedric Bakambu in the 15th minute which had given Betis the lead. Forest squandered their lead, which came courtesy of a brace from Igor Jesus, during their first foray into European competition since the 1995-96 season.

Wayne Rooney admitted that Cristiano Ronaldo's brain blew him away as the Manchester United legend hailed his former team-mate's "selfish mentality". The pair formed one of the most devastating partnerships Old Trafford has ever seen, firing United to Premier League and Champions League glory. Yet behind the scenes, differences in mindset and priorities were already bubbling.

By Francisco Quatrin

In a surprising development, FIFA president Gianni Infantino met in New York with Alejandro Domínguez, head of CONMEBOL, to evaluate the possibility of expanding the 2030 FIFA World Cup from the already expanded 48-team format (set for 2026) to a groundbreaking 64 national teams. The tournament, which will be hosted primarily by Spain, Portugal, and Morocco, also includes special group-stage matches in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay to honor the centennial of the first World Cup held in Montevideo in 1930.

The meeting also included key South American leaders such as Claudio Tapia (Argentine Football Association), Ignacio Alonso (Uruguayan Football Association), and Robert Harrison (Paraguayan Football Association). Yamandú Orsi, Uruguay president, and Santiago Peña, Paraguay president, were also present. The soccer discussion was described as “historic” by Domínguez, who stressed the ambition of making World Cup 2030 a landmark edition.

According to reports from La Nación, it was Infantino himself who pushed for the meeting and strongly supports the idea of expansion. The World Cup has already grown once: the 2026 edition in the United States, Mexico, and Canada will feature 48 teams instead of the traditional 32. But taking the leap to 64 would be unprecedented, creating a tournament with 128 matches, twice as many as the 64 games played from 1998 to 2022.

The logic behind the move is clear: more teams mean more global participation, more television revenue, and expanded markets. However, critics argue the competition could become too diluted, stretching the calendar and exhausting players. Still, Infantino has been traveling extensively, including a recent visit to Morocco and talks with leaders in Asia and Africa, looking to build consensus for the plan.

The first World Cup was won by Uruguay, who faced Argentina in the final.

If approved, the 2030 World Cup would feature 16 groups of four teams each. The top two teams from every group would move on to the knockout stage, creating a Round of 32. From there, the competition would follow the same elimination model familiar to fans, but with more matches and potentially higher logistical challenges.

For Argentina, the stakes are particularly symbolic. The country is expected to host one of the groups, with River Plate's Monumental Stadium in Buenos Aires reportedly set to stage the national team's opening match. Uruguay and Paraguay would also host group games, with Paraguay even building a new stadium to be ready in time for the tournament.

The decision is not final yet, but Domínguez hinted at “news that will impact the entire world” in the coming months. If FIFA moves forward, the 2030 World Cup would not only celebrate 100 years of history but also mark a new era where global inclusivity and commercial opportunity redefine the tournament.

Chelsea have been informed that a Real Madrid superstar could now be tempted to join them.

Enzo Maresca's side edged past League One minnows Lincoln City by the skin of their teeth on Tuesday night, despite fielding a largely strong side including a host of senior stars.

Rob Street's deserved Lincoln opener just before half-time threatened to knock Chelsea out of the Carabao Cup in very early and humbling fashion, but Maresca was rescued by an excellent strike from Tyrique George and a second goal from summer signing Facundo Buonanotte just minutes later.

The 2-1 win was a nervy one, and it perhaps encapsulates why Chelsea are far from the end product, even after a busy summer transfer window.

Cole Palmer's reoccurring groin problem is a major worry for Chelsea given just how reliant they currently are on the England star's undoubted match-winning quality, with their botched deal for attacking midfield alternative Xavi Simons threatening to haunt Maresca.

 Some reports are claiming that a new problem in that same groin for Palmer means that he faces several weeks out (Simon Phillips), and you can make a case that Bunonanottte isn't at the level required to replace the ex-Man City star on a regular basis.

Estimated games Cole Palmer could miss after reported new groin injury

Lincoln City (A) - EFL Cup

 Brighton (H) - Premier League

 Benfica (H) - Champions League

 Liverpool (H) - Premier League

 Nottingham Forest (A) - Premier League

 Ajax (H) - Champions League

 Sunderland (H) - Premier League

 Tottenham (A) - Premier League

Maresca also wanted a new goalkeeper and centre-back in the summer window (Simon Phillips), amid doubts surrounding the suitability of Robert Sanchez as number one, which were made all the more prevalent by his sending off against Man United last weekend.

Chelsea are expected to go back in for Mike Maignan on a potential pre-contract after failing to strike a deal in the summer, while the Blues are also actively looking at central defensive options.

Maresca is light in that area right now, with the Italian complaining that he's unable to rest key defenders. The consensus is that they also need to bring in a world-class, experienced centre-half to stable the ship, if Chelsea are serious about challenging for the Premier League title.

Even with their glaring defensive needs, journalist Graeme Bailey has now told TBR Football that an audacious move for Real Madrid superstar Vinícius Jr is on the cards for 2026.

 The Brazil international kissed Real's badge after his goal in their 4-1 La Liga win over Levante on Tuesday, but behind-closed-doors, things are proving far more complicated.

There is apparent "frustration" aimed at Alonso over Vinicius' role in the squad, and talks over a new deal have stalled due to extortionate wage demands as his contract ticks down towards expiry in 2027.

Real have apparently been clear to the 25-year-old - agree a new contract by next summer or be sold.

According to Bailey, Chelsea have been informed that Vinicius could be open to a Premier League move if they give him the opportunity, and sources are "insisting" that the winger's exit is indeed a possibility.

“Florentino Perez loves Vinicius Junior but there are concerns within the club about whether he is going to sign this new deal," Bailey said.

“It is hard to imagine Vinicius not being at Madrid but sources are insisting this possibility.

“The coming months are going to be intriguing but the basic point is that Real won't allow him to go into the final 12 months of his deal and potentially look at a free transfer.”

He has commanded a mammoth price tag in recent years, but by the time next summer rolls around, Vinicius will have just one year remaining on his deal. That would put Perez in a very vulnerable position, and the Los Blancos chief could be forced to sell for a lesser fee.

In terms of whether Chelsea should capitalise on this, Vinicius is one of those special players you build a team around, and the South American could help to ease the burden on Palmer's shoulders as Maresca's standout creative force.

Of course, Chelsea would face major competition, with Arsenal, PSG, Bayern and Liverpool named as other suitors, so it would still be far from easy.

Seven games into the new season, Chelsea are not where they would want to be.

The Blues sit sixth in the Premier League table, having won just two of their opening five league games.

But why has the start to the season been worse than many would have expected? Can it all be blamed on the Club World Cup, or is there more to it?

Chelsea were one of only two Premier League clubs, alongside Manchester City, who were present at FIFA's revamped Club Wold Cup tournament in the USA over the summer.

It meant that while the other 18 Premier League clubs, including the Blues' competitors such as Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham were able to have at least six weeks off, Enzo Maresca and his players were only able to take two weeks off after the tournament, and only returned to training a couple of weeks before the Premier League started.

They did, of course, win the tournament, beating PSG 3-0 in style, which would have gone some way to making up for the burden of the event, but the physical strain on the players cannot be underestimated.

That strain has been shown by Chelsea's early injuries.

Levi Colwill picked up an ACL injury only days after Chelsea began training for the new season. The English centre-half played 38 games for Chelsea last term, then flew out with England for a camp and two games, before going straight to the FIFA tournament and playing five games there.

Cole Palmer, Chelsea's best and most important player, has had issues with a groin injury since the season began. The forward started the opening league game against Crystal Palace, before missing two games and returning against Brentford. He played in that game and against Bayern Munich in the Champions League, but was taken off after 20 minutes against Manchester United because of the persistent problem.

Palmer played 52 times for Chelsea last campaign, including the Club World Cup. It cannot be purely coincidental that Colwill and Palmer – two players who played among the most minutes in the squad – have now picked up serious injuries.

Colwill is Chelsea's best centre-back and a huge defensive miss, but if Palmer is to miss large parts of the season he is almost irreplaceable. He scored 18 goals and registered 13 assists last term.

And it's not just those two. Dario Essugo, Benoit Badiashile, Romeo Lavia and Liam Delap are all players who played in the summer tournament and now find themselves injured.

Despite clear issues that have arisen as a result of the heavy workload on the players, not all of Chelsea's shortcomings can be attributed to that.

On paper, the Blues had a very favourable start to the season. Crystal Palace, West Ham, Fulham and Brentford as the first four league games.

To take eight points from those games is a disappointment. Chelsea would have expected to beat Palace at home, and they would also expect to beat 17th place Brentford, who have lost their two best players and their manager.

It's not only the results that were disappointing but the performances were too. Chelsea were lacklustre against Palace, could and perhaps should have gone behind against Fulham, and were sloppy and defensively poor against Brentford.

The Brentford game was four days before Chelsea's trip to the Allianz Arena, and Enzo Maresca opted for an experimental side. Jamie Gittens and Facundo Buonanotte started, whilst Jorrel Hato debuted in defence, and looked overwhelmed.

The game required the late substitutions of Palmer and Alejandro Garnacho to see Chelsea score twice, and they still conceded in the last minute.

Fans were curious as to why Maresca chose to give two players their full debuts, Buonanotte and Hato, a decision which backfired.

And things seem to have gone downhill since that last minute equaliser that Brentford's Fabio Carvalho inflicted on them.

They were well beaten against Bayern Munich before disaster struck against Manchester United.

Robert Sanchez's daft decision to take out Bryan Mbeumo in the fifth minute and reduce the Blues to ten men was costly, but so were Maresca's ensuing decisions.

The Italian made three substitutions immediately following the red card. Palmer was an enforced one, but Estevao and Pedro Neto were also taken off. Three forward players left the pitch, and no forward players came on, leaving only one attacker, Joao Pedro, on the pitch.

Fans were baffled at Maresca's defensive substitutions, and United scored twice before the end of the first half anyway. Chelsea eventually got one back in the 80th minute, but it was too little, too late.

Maresca said after the game: “All the game changed after the red card, all the planning and everything, it doesn't exist anymore.”

While that might be true, part of a manager's job is to be reactive to in-game events. Those quotes, and Maresca's substitutions, were concerning.

After three games without a win and in need of some positivity, a Carabao Cup game against League One side Lincoln City seemed timely.

Maresca fielded a fairly strong side with several regulars starting. Chelsea prevailed 2-1, but Lincoln were the better team in the first half and went ahead in the game. It took a brilliant strike from George and a first goal from Buonanotte for the Blues to avoid a Manchester United v Grimsby style embarrassment.

Chelsea's transfer strategy is something that predates Maresca and was implemented when Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital took control of the club in May 2022.

The ownership and sporting directors have always had a youth-led approach in the transfer market, aiming to sign the best young talent from around the world before they become renowned stars.

The strategy made sense in the early years. Chelsea had an ageing squad and players like Jorginho, Cesar Azpilicueta, Antonio Rudiger and many others needed replacing.

There was also a period of grace for the new owners and sporting directors. They had to get their feet under the table and work things out.

Failed transfers like Mykhailo Mudryk, Joao Felix, Axel Disasi, Badiashile and others were to be anticipated. But with investment comes expectation.

Now the ownership have been in place for three years and spent £1.5 billion. So rightly, the expectations for the club have increased. While they have had some success, winning the Conference League, Club World Cup and qualifying for the Champions League last season, fans expect a Premier League title challenging team. Not necessarily title winning, but title challenging.

Chelsea made some questionable decisions this summer. Letting go of Noni Madueke and signing Gittens and Garnacho does not appear an improvement.

Hato may become a brilliant defender. But he is not currently, and so does not make a massive impact on Chelsea's hopes in the immediate future.

After Colwill got injured, Maresca emphasised the need for a new centre-back signing. There was still almost a month left of the window but nothing was done.

So is it any surprise that with mounting injuries and young players such as Gittens and Hato who do not seem ready, as yet, for the top level of the Premier League, Chelsea are having a mixed season so far?

Maresca will no doubt to continue to carefully manage his squad to try to avoid injuries, but he must hope his young signings can quickly reach the level required if squad rotation is not to hamper the team too much.

Chelsea will have minimum expectations of qualifying for the knockout rounds of the Champions League and at the very least finishing in the top four. A domestic cup win would help matters but overall, there has to be clear signs of progress towards become a title contending team.

The transfer strategy has to change, that is clear. Chelsea need world-class players, not potentially world-class players. But they may have to endure an underwhelming season before they get another go at improving.

President met South American powerbrokers in NYC

World body would face opposition to 64-team plan

Fifa is not planning to expand the men's World Cup to 64 teams for the centenary edition of the tournament in 2030, despite its president, Gianni Infantino, meeting a delegation of South America leaders to discuss the idea in New York.

Infantino met the Uruguay and Paraguay heads of state, the president of South American confederation, Conmebol, as well the presidents of the Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay federations at Fifa's offices in Trump Tower on Tuesday for the first formal discussions about a proposal that was raised informally by the Uruguayan Football Association at a Fifa Council meeting last March.

Fifa's official position is that it will discuss World Cup expansion with all its stakeholders and that it is duty-bound to consider proposals raised at council. But behind the scenes there is scepticism about whether expanding the tournament to 64 teams is a viable proposition. Next year's World Cup will be the first to contain 48 teams, while the governing body has broken with convention for 2030 by staging the tournament in six countries on three continents. Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina will host the first three matches in tribute to the competition's South American origins in 1930, before the bulk of the tournament moves to Morocco, Spain and Portugal.

Any decision to expand the World Cup would be taken by Fifa Council, which meets in Zurich next month, but that is not on the agenda.

“Gianni would not get that vote through Council even if he wanted to,” a Fifa source said. “The overwhelming feeling around the table – and not just in Europe – is that 64 teams would damage the World Cup. There'd be too many uncompetitive matches and it would risk damaging the business model.”

Conmebol would be the major beneficiaries of another expansion and sources with knowledge of Tuesday's meeting disclosed that Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina claimed to have the capability to host all of the group stage.

Expansion to 64 teams would mean more than 30% of Fifa's 211 member associations would take part, as well as putting all 10 Conmebol in the frame to qualify, up from six direct qualifiers next year, plus the possibility of an extra place via an inter-confederation playoff.

The 64-team idea was first presented at Fifa Council last April, but prompted an immediate backlash. The Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, described it as a “bad idea” that would reduce the quality of the tournament and undermine the qualifying competition. The Concacaf president, Victor Montagliani, said: “They [Fifa] can study all they want, but it just doesn't feel right.” Significantly, both men are Fifa vice-presidents.

Fifa is also facing calls from leading European clubs to expand the Club World Cup from 32 teams in 2029 due to the huge prize and appearance money on offer. Chelsea collected £85m for winning it in July. Staging the competition every two years is also being considered.

A 64-team World Cup would feature 128 matches, double the number played at the most recent tournament in Qatar three years ago and 24 more than next year. The World Cup has grown significantly in recent decades, increasing from 16 to 24 teams in 1982, growing again to 32 in 1998 before becoming a 48-team competition next summer.

Any decision to expand the World Cup would be taken by Fifa's Council, which meets in Zurich next month, although the issue is not thought to be on the agenda.

Fifa declined to comment.

In this story:

Chelsea have released the team's 2025/26 squad photo as they showcased the UEFA Conference League and FIFA Club World Cup trophies.

It has been a mixed start to the season for Chelsea, who are currently sixth in the Premier League table with two wins and a loss from their opening five games.

It is great, therefore, to see that there are plenty of smiles among the players in the squad photo, which the club shared on Wednesday.

Head coach Enzo Maresca sits in the middle, of course, alongside his primary assistant and former Chelsea goalkeeper Willy Caballero.

Next to these two coaches are captain Reece James and vice captain Enzo Fernandez, and in front of them, the two trophies the team won last season: the Conference League and the Club World Cup.

It is also great to see Levi Colwill, who is still recovering from a long-term anterior cruciate ligament injury, again.

When speaking recently about his squad and Chelsea's Premier League title hopes, Maresca insisted that his team has been improving and closing the gap to the leading teams.

"For me, this season, the main target is to continue to improve players, continue to improve the team and try to close that gap. This is, for me, the main focus for this season."

The Blues are still in contention to compete for four trophies this season, including the Carabao Cup, in which they have just reached the fourth round after beating Lincoln City on Tuesday.

While in the Champions League, Chelsea's return to the competition was unfortunately marked with a defeat to Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich. 

Maresca's men will be able to bounce back with a win as they host Benfica in the Champions League at Stamford Bridge next week. But before that, the next challenge is Brighton in a Premier League bout on Saturday.

On today's episode, we're celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month, which runs Sept. 15-Oct. 15.

Our three hosts begin the show talking about their heroes. Alejandro Bedoya shares his admiration for footballer Carlos "El Pibe" Valderrama – hair and all – and what it was like to meet the Colombian icon (2:00). Meghan Klingenberg reveals which USWNT legend's jersey (6:10) she grew up wearing.

Then, USMNT and Seattle Sounders midfielder Cristian Roldan joins Bedoya to talk more about the impact of Hispanic heritage on their game (10:40) and the upcoming World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Roldan discusses his early soccer memories, the community in Pico Rivera, California where he grew up (14:30), the influence of his Latin heritage on his playing style and which delicacy he craves the most (27:00).

The hosts close the show taking questions from supporters with Ask the Pros presented by O'Reilly's (29:15) where Klingenberg reveals the latest fusion she's cooking up in the kitchen (34:50).

Carlo Ancelotti has revealed that his dismissal by Bayern Munich was "worse" than the sackings he faced at Chelsea and Real Madrid. The Italian coach says it was a mistake against Paris Saint-Germain that saw him given his walking papers just a month into the 2017-18 season. The legendary manager reflected on the disappointing period in an upcoming autobiography.

Q2 Stadium opened its doors less than five years ago, and in a short time it's quickly become a special place for the U.S. Men's National Team. The USMNT is undefeated in Austin, Texas through six games — all of them shutouts. 

The National Team competes in venues across the world, but Austin is one of five cities in the country where the USMNT is unbeaten after at least five games played. AT&T Stadium, up the I-35 in Arlington, Texas holds the longest streak with seven. Both were recent stops in the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup where the United States made a run to the final.

The Americans return to the home of the Austin FC on Oct. 10 to face World Cup-qualified Ecuador at 8:30 p.m. ET in the build-up to the 2026 FIFA tournament next summer. This will be the second friendly, while the other five matches have been tournament games, including the Concacaf Gold Cup and Nations League as well as FIFA World Cup Qualifiers. The first friendly was head coach Mauricio Pochettino's first game — and win — in October 2024. 

It wasn't too long ago when the USMNT last took the field in the Texas capital. The USA took down Saudi Arabia 1-0 in a group stage match of the Gold Cup this past June. Defender Chris Richards earned Man of the Match honors as he scored his second international goal and made a key tackle to prevent a Saudi Arabia potential scoring opportunity. 

The six matches at Q2 have been electric. Three of the outings have been sellouts with a total average attendance of more than 18,000. The USMNT has given fans a lot to cheer for in Austin with 14 goals scored and none allowed. 

Striker Ricardo Pepi and forward Jesús Ferreira have accounted for eight of those goals, scoring four each. The forwards have deep ties to Texas as Pepi grew up in El Paso and Ferreira spent formative years in Dallas, and both came up through the FC Dallas Academy. Ferreira totaled that amount in one match in June 2022 against Grenada in the Nations League opener. The impressive four-goal match tied a USMNT record that only five players have touched. 

The United States will look to continue that winning legacy and go 7-0 in Austin. A victory over Ecuador would extend its win streak versus the CONMEBOL side to four, which would be the longest current streak against a South American opponent.

Alexi Lalas has dropped his usual line of relentlessly lambasting Christian Pulisic to go to the other extreme, hailing the American forward as the best player AC Milan currently boast.

Lalas is an infamously outspoken critic of all that involves the U.S. men's national team (USMNT). Back in 2017, the former international defender brandished Pulisic and his colleagues “a bunch of soft, underperforming, tattooed millionaires” and has maintained a steady stream of dissenting commentary over the subsequent years.

Much like his compatriots Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey, Lalas was unimpressed with Pulisic's decision to skip this summer's Gold Cup. The 27-year-old explained that he needed time off to recovery after a draining European campaign before gearing up for the 2026 World Cup which will be co-hosted by the U.S.

That rest has already paid off. Pulisic boasts five goals across Milan's first six games of the new campaign, taking his tally to 59 in Europe's top five leagues which is a new high among USMNT male players.

Lalas let the excitement of Pulisic's strong form get the better of him. Speaking in the aftermath of Milan's 3–0 win over Udinese, which saw a player Lalas once sarcastically derided as “Wonder Boy” bag a brace, the professional pundit declared: “I think you are looking at it certainly right now, and if you need any more proof, this game is it, that he is an elite player in Serie A. He is, I think arguably the best player for AC Milan.”

Pulisic is the only Milan player with more than one goal to his name this season although Rafael Leão, who has been struggling with injuries, would certainly challenge his claim to be the team's most important figure. Luka Modrić, the former Ballon d'Or holder and six-time Champions League winner, may also have something to say about Lalas's ranking.

Nevertheless, the excitable commentator would not be deterred. “This was a phenomenal game,” he continued. “I think something that he will remember and Pulisic fans, fans of the U.S. national team and AC Milan fans can appreciate, and I think we'll remember for a long time. Everything he touched seemed to turn to gold.

“So this was everything that Christian Pulisic is encapsulated into one game. And rightfully he is receiving the flowers that a performance like that and combined with I think a consistency now of quality and elite performances that was attributed to him.”

The FIFA World Cup 2026 is poised to be the largest of its kind, expanding from 32 teams to 48, with matches scheduled to be played across the North American continent. United 2026, the joint bid by the host nations, consists of the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

However, the sheer size of this football tournament casts a dark shadow on the environment, even threatening livelihoods. Sponsorship deals with fossil fuel companies, extensive air travel, suppression of protests from local communities, and construction on forests all set the 2026 iteration to be the one with the highest carbon footprint yet.

A new report by Scientists for Global Responsibility, “FIFA's Climate Blind Spot: The Men's World Cup in a Warming World,” finds that the expansion of the tournament from 32 to 48 teams will lead to a significant increase in emissions for the 2026, 2030, and 2034 iterations of the event — particularly due to air transport for teams, staff, and fans.

The report estimates that the World Cup will generate at least 9.0 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, the highest ever in the event's 95-year history. The Spanish-led 2030 iteration will lead to 6.1 million tCO2e, and the 2034 Finals in Saudi Arabia will be responsible for 8.6 million tCO2e.

FIFA has not had the best track record in staying aligned with climate strategies. In 2021, FIFA launched an initiative at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), pledging to reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by 2040.

But the credibility of FIFA's previous claims of carbon neutrality at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar has already been questioned by multiple groups. The Swiss Commission for Fairness, based in Zurich, also reported that the organization was “not able to provide proof that the claims were accurate” and “did not set out a plan to define how it will further offset emissions”.

FIFA's case becomes even more questionable considering notable sponsors of the event include airline and oil companies such as Qatar Airways and Aramco.

“How is it possible that they have a first-class stadium, and next to it, a town that's dead?”

While the event will use existing venues, instead of requiring the construction of newer ones, preparations and expansions continue to hurt local communities.

People living in areas surrounding the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City say development plans for the area will worsen the water supply and threaten green spaces.

“We have a right to constitution,” says Rubén Ramírez, a community leader in Santa Úrsula Coapa, a district in Mexico City. “They're ignoring us completely. We don't know anything.”

The constitution states that in the case of constructing on Indigenous land, authorities must legally consult local communities and leaders, such as Ramírez. However, their protests are being ignored as the government continues preparations for the World Cup.

There are even plans to turn a 5,000-square-meter forest area inside Santa Úrsula into a construction site.

“They can't take it, this is the lungs of the community,” says Ramírez. “Why do they have to build it here? Take it somewhere else.”

It is estimated that the World Cup will inject up to £5.2 billion into the country, locking the Mexican government's interests entirely.

The biggest issue, however, might be the water supply. Water shortages are a common issue across Mexico City, and the Azteca district is further threatened by the expansion of the stadium. Televisa, a company that partly owns the Azteca stadium, privatized a well in the area in 2018, further worsening the condition, as the Santa Úrsula community protests that this contract was illegal and has contributed to exploitation.

“The stadium is part of the community's territory,” says Ramírez. “It's the owners, the businesspeople who are going to benefit from the World Cup. What are the community going to see? Nothing.”

To counteract these effects, the report suggests that FIFA:

Dembélé, the new king of football


The 2025 Ballon d'Or crowned Ousmane Dembélé as the best player in the world after a spectacular season with PSG. The Frenchman lifted the Champions League, Ligue 1, French Cup and French Super Cup, while scoring 35 goals and adding 16 assists. Numbers that finally established him as the undisputed leader he had long been expected to become. 





The vote confirmed what many anticipated: Dembélé's maturity placed him above everyone else, even one of the brightest young stars on the planet.


Yamal, the big loser of the night


On the other side stood Lamine Yamal, the 18-year-old prodigy who dreamed of becoming the youngest Ballon d'Or winner in history. His silence after the ceremony reflected the blow of hearing Dembélé's name instead of his.





Although he was recognized with the 2025 Kopa Trophy as the world's best young player, Yamal had prepared a private celebration in Paris with family and friends that never came to be. His defeat left a bittersweet taste: a secure future, but still without the ultimate glory.


The Champions League twist


What the Ballon d'Or separated, the Champions League will bring back together. On October 1, Yamal's Barcelona will visit Dembélé's PSG in the second matchday of the continental tournament.

It will be a clash loaded with intrigue: the new Ballon d'Or holder against the player many believe is destined to dominate the next decade. Paris will once again set the stage for their story, only this time on the pitch, with the ball rolling and the chance to prove who truly deserves the throne.

A comeback full of symbolism


José Mourinho never leaves anyone indifferent. Just weeks after ending his spell at Fenerbahçe, the Portuguese coach is back where it all began: Benfica. The dismissal of Bruno Lage, following the Eagles' painful Champions League defeat to Qarabag, opened the door for The Special One to return to the Estádio da Luz.





The story has a curious, even controversial twist: it was Benfica who eliminated Fenerbahçe from the Champions League shortly before Mourinho's arrival. In Turkey, many view it as a hidden betrayal, while in Portugal, it feels like a circle being closed.


Closing the circle in Lisbon


Mourinho had already experienced a brief spell at Benfica back in 2000. It lasted just nine games, but it was the first step in a career that would take him to the very top of European football. From there, he moved to Porto, where he became a legend by winning two league titles, a UEFA Cup and the Champions League that changed his life.





That meteoric rise catapulted him to Chelsea, Inter, Real Madrid and Manchester United. Titles, controversies and unforgettable quotes made him an unrepeatable figure. In recent years, however, his trophy cabinet lost its shine: the Conference League with Roma and barren spells at Tottenham and Fenerbahçe were a far cry from the dominant Mourinho of another era.


Between betrayal and excitement


Returning to Benfica means more than coming home — it also means taking charge of Porto's eternal rival, the very club that made him a legend. It's reminiscent of what he experienced in Spain when he joined Real Madrid, knowing he would divide passions and fire up opposing fans.

In Lisbon, Mourinho is chasing what he has sought in recent years: a return to the elite, the joy of football, and another chapter of glory. This is his home, this is Portugal, and this is the Champions League — the stage where he has always felt most alive. And while some may call it betrayal, he sees it as another chance to be happy.

Alex Morgan is honored and has her No. 13 jersey retired by San Diego. (0:33)

DEL MAR, Calif. -- One year ago, after Alex Morgan announced to the world in a video that she was pregnant and retiring with almost immediate effect, she sat in her car alone and cried.

"I was like OK, it's out there. Now I'm going to enjoy it," she told ESPN in a sit-down interview.

Morgan's 15-year career -- which included two World Cup titles, an Olympic gold medal and multiple major club trophies -- ended abruptly, but she'd already been working for years on her next chapter to come in the world of business.

Morgan was the face of the U.S. women's national team and arguably the most famous female athlete globally for over a decade. She grew to such fame that she transcended the sport, signing deals with Coca-Cola and Nike, appearing in commercials with NBA star LeBron James and even receiving her own custom Barbie. Along the way, she observed how the business of sports operates, but also how it failed female athletes with minimal media coverage and low salaries ($6,000 was the minimum when the NWSL launched in 2013).

Now, Morgan is a minority investor in San Diego Wave FC, the last team she played for, along with other investments including the new 3-on-3 women's basketball league, Unrivaled. In 2019, in the prime of her career, she co-founded the content brand Togethxr with fellow athletes and Olympic gold medalists Sue Bird, Simone Manuel and Chloe Kim.

"I just realized that there are so many ways for athletes to carry on their business far past their playing career and to make a business of it, of their brand, far past their playing days," Morgan said. "That's what I've tried to set up the last five to eight years.

"And I think that's why I was so at peace with retiring from playing soccer, because I didn't retire and wake up the next day going, 'What's next?' I already had so many different things in motion -- it wasn't like figuring the next thing out as one door closed and the next door opened. I was juggling a lot of things at once and trying to learn a lot of new things off the field."

Morgan's hands-on experience at the highest level of sport is why other businesswomen have invested in her. Olivia Walton, the founder of Ingeborg Investments -- which focuses on women-led, early-stage startups -- met Morgan at a conference for women in venture capital. The two shared a vision "from the beginning," said Walton, who joined Togethxr as an investor earlier this year.

Morgan's achievements as a player were part of the selling point to Walton.

"Alex approaches business the same way she approaches competition -- with curiosity, intensity, and purpose," Walton told ESPN via email. "She sees opportunities others miss because she's lived the athlete's journey, and she brings an authenticity that's rare in this space."

Togethxr's primary business is branded studio content, including films focused on women athletes. The company said it was profitable last year and claimed it saw a large increase in revenue (to $30 million) and valuation.

"That 360-degree perspective is unmatched, and it makes her one of the most important voices shaping the future of the game," Walton said. "Few people can walk into a room and be listened to equally by players, sponsors, and investors like Alex can."

That is high praise for someone whose business experience has been, by Morgan's own admission, learning as she goes. Morgan studied political economics at Cal-Berkeley, but she was becoming a household name with the USWNT before she even graduated college -- where she "was very head down, driven to be the best soccer player I could possibly be."

Alex Morgan reacts to her first goal for the USWNT in a friendly vs. China.

These days, Morgan is busy beyond Togethxr. For one, she is now a mom of two, telling ESPN that she tries to find balance in simple ways like stepping out to take a walk.

Through Trybe Ventures, the investment arm she has with her husband, Servando Carrasco, she also has a stake in roughly two dozen companies ranging from media to sports technology. Among their other investments are the Los Angeles Golf Club in TGL, and Classic Football Shirts, a company focused on nostalgic soccer kits.

Dan Levy, who has been Morgan's agent since she first became a professional soccer player, said it's rare to find an athlete who can successfully navigate business ventures in the prime of their career.

"A lot of athletes struggle with trying to figure out how to manage their career and be the best at what they do on the field, on the court, and at the same time, put in the time, effort, and work to build their business outside of it," he told Variety recently.

Today, Morgan leans on those athlete experiences -- and the expertise of partners like Walton -- to sharpen herself as a businessperson.

"I'm learning in this new space every single day," Morgan said. "It's very humbling and it's also really challenging in a lot of ways -- in a good way, in the way that I was challenged on the soccer field every day. I feel like I rely on a lot of the skills that I learned in soccer, a lot of the personal character-building skills that I can apply to business."

Morgan made a quick transition from player to team owner for the Wave, retiring last September and joining the team as an investor in May.

Alex Morgan says never in her "wildest dreams" would she see San Diego Wave retire her. No. 13 jersey.

Last year, amid turmoil for the Wave on and off the field that included allegations from former employees of a toxic work environment, Morgan prominently spoke as an active player, tweeting "it is clear that there is so much work to be done." Since then, the team has fully transitioned ownership to the Levine Leichtman family and turned over its front office, including the December departure of former team president Jill Ellis, who along with the club denied allegations made by previous employees. (Ellis filed a defamation lawsuit, while the employees are suing the Wave and the NWSL.)

Asked what has changed with the club in just over a year and why she invested, Morgan said that one of the reasons she wanted to invest is to provide feedback from the perspective of a former player. She said she wants to provide mentorship to young players, several of whom on the Wave are teenagers. Twenty-four-year-old defender Kennedy Wesley said after the Wave retired Morgan's No. 13 jersey on Sept. 7 that she grew up with a poster of Morgan on her wall.

Morgan was more than just a great player who scored 123 international goals. She was a central figure in the USWNT's fight against the U.S. Soccer Federation for equal pay, which it achieved via settlement in 2022 after a six-year fight. She was also an active participant in the NWSL's collective bargaining negotiations, and one of the prominent voices in the fight against the NWSL's previous inaction against abuses.

Her public statements contributed to the firing of Paul Riley from the North Carolina Courage for alleged previous sexual misconduct with players, and to the ousting of former NWSL commissioner Lisa Baird for her handling of the complaints.

Morgan said the NWSL has significantly improved from "the leanest years" when it launched with her as a player in 2013, and from the league's recent overhaul following what multiple investigations revealed as "systemic" abuse.

Players have obtained more agency and workplace protection through the new CBA. One specific new policy Morgan pointed to is the ability to take paid mental health leave, as multiple players in the NWSL have done this year.

"That just didn't exist a couple of years ago," Morgan said. "I attempted to do that with the national team and then I was not called back in for six or seven months because of it, because of raising my hand and saying I need a break, I just had a baby, and I need to step away for this next camp. And then I wasn't invited back for six or seven months.

"Players now can do that without repercussion. Everyone needs a break at some point or another, whether it's in their second year or 15th year playing soccer, playing sports, in their job. The ability to be able to do that is something that's new and I feel like I've advocated for players to be able to be able to be the driving force of this league.

"There is no league without players, so let's treat them right, let's give them all the resources we could possibly do like with financial literacy, with mental stability, with family planning, whatever it may be. I have fought for those things both as a player and now as an owner."

Morgan has long known she has a large platform. Her voice has directly driven change in the NWSL and U.S. Soccer, and that hands-on approach remains. "She's not just lending her name -- she's in the meetings, driving ideas forward, and shaping the vision," Walton said. "That level of commitment is rare."

Morgan's commitment to growth is embodied by the slogan made famous by Togethxr: "Everyone Watches Women's Sports." It's a campaign increasingly plastered across apparel, but it's also statistically backed (even if slightly exaggerated) by rising media deals, attendance, and valuations across women's sports. Women's sports have become big business.

NWSL teams have increased from $2 million sales five years ago to a $250 million sale of Angel City FC last year. Transfer fees crossed the $1 million mark for the first time in January and the world record fell on multiple occasions since as teams invest more in players.

Morgan teased another forthcoming investment in women's sports "soon" when she spoke with ESPN. This is her new life, one that traded her boots for the boardroom and her foundation for equity in sports.

Morgan is learning day to day on the fly, but she knows one thing firsthand: "Listen, anyone who's smart is getting into investing in women's sports."

FILE - Members of the Afghan women's football team attend Morocco's practice ahead of the Women's World Cup in Melbourne, Australia, Wednesday, July 19, 2023.

ZURICH (AP) — The Afghanistan national women's soccer team of refugee players has its first official games next month at a four-team tournament in Dubai, FIFA said Wednesday.

The FIFA-supported team — which cannot yet officially represent Afghanistan in World Cup qualifying — will face the host United Arab Emirates, Chad and Libya in the Oct. 23-29 event.

Afghanistan has not played an official women's competitive game since 2018, and the return to power of the Taliban regime in 2021 shut down women's sport. The Afghan soccer federation has obligations under FIFA statutes to avoid discrimination though has not been suspended from international soccer.

The tournament “reinforces FIFA's efforts to promote and protect the right of all women and girls to play the sport, pursue their footballing dreams and thrive through the game,” the soccer body said.

The women's teams of Chad and Libya do not yet have a FIFA ranking, and the UAE is No. 117.

FIFA said all games at the round-robin tournament will be broadcast live on its in-house streaming platform.

The boy who gave Barcelona hope


When Ansu Fati made his debut for FC Barcelona in 2019, at just 16 years, 9 months, and 25 days old, he looked destined for greatness. A product of La Masía, he was seen as the heir to fill the void Lionel Messi would eventually leave. His flair, fearlessness, and goal-scoring instinct instantly made him the jewel Barcelona fans had been waiting for.





The club quickly secured him with a €400 million release clause in 2019, and by 2021 it was raised to €1 billion—right after he inherited Messi's legendary No. 10 shirt following the Argentine's move to PSG. What seemed like the start of a golden era soon turned into a nightmare.


The nightmare of injuries


In November 2020, Ansu suffered a torn meniscus in his left knee, an injury that required four surgeries and kept him sidelined for nearly a year. That was only the beginning of a downward spiral that pulled him away from the glorious path many thought was his destiny.

When he returned, he was no longer the same. His physical condition lagged, his confidence dipped, and under Xavi Hernández, he slipped from the bench to the stands. Eventually, Barcelona loaned him to Brighton in the Premier League, but the spark never came back.






Brighton struggles and a gray return to Barça


With the Seagulls, Ansu made 30 appearances across all competitions, but managed just 4 goals and 1 assist. His underwhelming stint brought him back to Barcelona carrying more doubts than answers.

Under Hansi Flick, things worsened: only 11 games played, totaling 298 minutes. A far cry from the expectations set for the player once seen as the face of Barça's future.


A new light in Monaco


Just when his career seemed to fade, AS Monaco opened a new door. His move in the latest transfer window has breathed fresh life into his journey. Though he took time to make his debut, he made an immediate impact: scoring in his Champions League debut against Club Brugge, and just three days later, netting a brace in his Ligue 1 debut versus Metz.

Football always offers second chances, and Ansu's might finally have arrived. It's too early to declare a full comeback, but the signs are promising. The football world would welcome the return of a player once hailed as Messi's heir—one who still has the potential to shine just as brightly as promised from the very start.

Women's Soccer

The Black Women's Player Collective (BWPC) will cohost a showcase in November aimed at identifying and nurturing young Black soccer talent, the organization announced Wednesday.

In partnership with Allstate and Black Star media, the Next Wave National Showcase will take place on the campus of Prairie View A&M, an historically Black college in Texas, from Nov. 22-25. Allstate provided the funding for the event, and Black Star will serve as the chief storyteller. The group will select 20-30 of the best Black high school soccer players in the country.

Between the elimination of the college draft and increased visibility of Black female soccer players succeeding at all levels of the game, the ability to properly scout and develop Black talent has become more critical. According to BWPC data, 3.8 per cent of NWSL players self-identified as Black during the 2020 season. That figure has since grown to 12 per cent for the 2025 season, while Black players make up nearly half of the U.S. women's national team.

“Black players have been historically underrepresented in this sport, and if you don't carve out space for us to exist in this community, then they'll be left behind,” North Carolina Courage forward Brianna Pinto, who serves on the board of the BWPC, told The Athletic before the announcement.

“It's incredibly important to the BWPC to make sure that we're creating a seat at the table for the next generation of Black athletes, and the way to do that is by making events specifically for them.”

The announcement comes one week after the NWSL announced it would host two combines for different age groups in December. One will be for players aged 13-17; the other for those 18-23, with an aim “to support NWSL clubs in early talent evaluation and provide players with exposure to a professional environment,” according to NWSL Director of Youth Development Karla Thompson.

Like the NWSL combine, the organizers of the Next Wave Showcase are yet to share their list of participating players. Pinto supports the expansion of opportunities for young players to show their skills in front of clubs, coaches, and agents, but emphasized the importance of showcasing Black talent.

“In this country, in a lot of social environments, Black people have been an afterthought and we want to celebrate our collective experience as minorities in this country because we have so much to share and so much to give and so much passion for the game,” she said. “I do believe that if we pour into our community, it will benefit the entire soccer landscape.”

Pinto said BWPC members will tap into their respective networks to nail down their invite list for the showcase. The itinerary will include “a lot of playing so that they can properly be evaluated,” Pinto said, adding the event would aim to “identify talent and push them to where they need to be.”

The BWPC and its partners were intentional about taking a holistic approach to the showcase, ensuring its messaging was aligned with its sporting ambitions. There will also be networking opportunities with coaches, scouts, and agents; and a media day for the players to gain experience interacting with the press.

Pinto said one detail that's garnered excitement among the BWPC is the inclusion of hair, makeup, and “off the field glam,” as she put it, to expose players to that side of professional sports.

In 2021, U.S. women's national team star Crystal Dunn spoke about the disappointment of walking into similar environments and being unable to work with hair and makeup artists who were trained to work with Black textured hair and darker complexions.

Pinto said the showcase will discuss nutrition and mental health with the players. She also hopes that it will “shift the landscape and give more attention to HBCU athletics programs.”

The showcase comes against the backdrop of the Trump administration targeting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs by withdrawing funding from initiatives, if not eliminating policies altogether. For Pinto, these efforts to specifically champion Black people have been vital for long before that.

“We've always had to create spaces for our own people to thrive and to fully be themselves,” she said. “I think as we move forward and continue to push the boundaries as those policies continue to get more restricted, we have to be diligent about protecting our own, and I think this is a way for us to show joy in the face of adversity.

“Joy is a contagious thing because if we put on an event where people are celebrated and they feel valued and seen as a whole human being, I think that's a way of protesting, of making space for these incredible individuals who are going to make up the next generation of athletes.”

Hello! Some free advice for a Wednesday: soccer investment is cheaper than NFL investment. And keep your shirt on…

🏈 EPL vs NFL valuations

📈 A 64-team World Cup?

🟥 Ekitike's ‘stupid' red card

👏 Classy Vini Jr finish

Sold for their market value of $12.8billion (£9.4bn), the Dallas Cowboys would raise enough money to buy Real Madrid and Barcelona combined, with a sliver of spare change left over. Or, if you'd rather, Liverpool, Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Miami. Football is your oyster, essentially, if you happen to own the NFL's richest franchise.

Valuations in sports are so extreme these days that when the proposed sale of the LA Lakers in June priced them at $10bn, it occurred to me that ownership is now limited to the highest of high rollers. Yet despite its wealth and ever-increasing reach, the cost of soccer teams doesn't quite match up to those in other U.S. fields.

In the weeks and months ahead, it's possible — and probable — that one of the biggest Spanish sides going will pass into American ownership (doesn't everybody, eventually?). Atletico Madrid, as reported yesterday, are the subject of a takeover bid from Apollo Global Management, an asset firm based on Wall Street. If and when the transaction goes through, it will value them at $2.6bn. In other words, one Dallas Cowboys buys you five Atleticos.

With prescient timing, The Athletic's Chris Weatherspoon addressed this exact topic this morning: the reasons why certain NFL franchises (not to mention some in basketball and baseball) are worth more than Premier League clubs and other European football giants. And will we hit a point where the balance tips, making soccer the biggest investment show in town?

To some extent, soccer is the biggest investment show in town already. Professional football clubs vastly outnumber NFL franchises, and takeover bids coming out of the U.S. over the past five to 10 years are almost too numerous to count. Half of the Premier League is American-owned.

But any time I think of the size of the NFL, I think of the fabled waiting list for season tickets at the Green Bay Packers, reported to sit at around 150,000 names and counting. As Chris points out, franchises like the Packers have enormous captive audiences, making them a commercial dream. No business is ever unhappy about being oversubscribed.

He also highlighted a few other reasons for the disparity in valuations:

FIFA, in particular, would love to think that someday soon, football will take over the planet in its entirety. It's why the governing body targeted the U.S. with both its Club World Cup and next year's World Cup. The game's popularity grows exponentially — but American sport is still where the biggest fortunes stand to be blown.

Alexander Isak banked his first Liverpool goal last night (an instalment on £125m paid back) but sadly for him, nobody is talking about it.

A 2-1 third-round Carabao Cup victory over Southampton was more notable for what happened later in the tie. Hugo Ekitike, the other big-money forward signed by Liverpool over the summer, won it in the 85th minute… and then immediately got himself sent off.

Ekitike, you see, said emotions got the better of him and seemingly forgot he'd already been booked for punching the ball away. So when he took his shirt off to celebrate his goal — a yellow card offence in itself — he was cautioned for a second time. As red cards go, it's more dense than a chunk of osmium.

Arne Slot wasn't remotely sympathetic. “Needless and stupid,” was how Liverpool's head coach described it. The upshot is that Ekitike misses their next game through suspension, away at Crystal Palace on Saturday (a tricky fixture against a side with their tails up). Isak's had a torrid time in the PR stakes recently but, for one evening only, he won't have minded holding Ekitike's beer.

Diego Gomez should have something about him. It wasn't as if he came for pennies. The deal which brought him to Brighton from Inter Miami in January cost £11m.

But four goals away at Barnsley in the Carabao Cup last night was an absurd flex, not least because two of them were goal-of-the-season contenders. The strike for 3-0, above, is the pick of them for me. I could watch that swerve on a loop all day.

FIFA held discussions on Tuesday about expanding the men's World Cup to a 64-team tournament in 2030 after receiving a formal pitch from a delegation of influential South American leaders.

The group included heads of state from Paraguay and Uruguay, as well as senior football executives from the South American confederation CONMEBOL and the head of the Argentine Football Association (AFA).

During meetings at FIFA's New York City headquarters inside Trump Tower, the FIFA president Gianni Infantino and general secretary Mattias Grafstrom received a number of politicians and football executives from Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay.

Alejandro Dominguez, president of South America's CONMEBOL federation and FIFA vice-president, led the discussions on behalf of the visiting delegation. He was joined by national president Santiago Pena of Paraguay and Yamandu Orsi of Uruguay. AFA chief Chiqui Tapia and his Paraguay and Uruguay counterparts, Robert Harrison and Nacho Alonso, were also present.

Argentina's head of state, Javier Milei, was not in attendance, as he was occupied by a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump amid economic turmoil in Argentina. Further meetings related to the 2030 World Cup are scheduled for this week.

The 64-team idea was first presented by the Uruguayan Football Association's president, Ignacio Alonso, during a FIFA Council meeting in March, according to The New York Times. The proposal surprised many on the call, but FIFA says it has a duty to consider ideas presented at its Council. In April, Dominguez pitched the idea to CONMEBOL's congress. He said the 64-team concept would be a one-off to mark the 100th anniversary of the first men's World Cup, which took place in Uruguay in 1930.

At the FIFA Congress in May, held in Paraguay, Dominguez urged FIFA to think about a unique approach for the centenary World Cup. He compared how a person might celebrate a 49th or 51st birthday differently from a 50th, saying dispensation should be made for special events.

“I would like to invite you to reflect together so we can do something that the world is waiting for, that the football community deserves. It is what football teaches us — to play as a team,” Dominguez said.

“I want to underline the words of Alejandro. He told all of us to think on how we can really celebrate it in the way it deserves to be celebrated. So every idea is a good idea,” Infantino said at the same Congress.

Grafstrom told reporters at the FIFA Congress that the presidents of CONMEBOL and FIFA “posed an open question about the Centenary World Cup.”

“All ideas are welcome, but no specific ideas have been discussed,” the FIFA general secretary said.

The tournament has grown in size in recent decades, having gone from 16 to 24 teams in 1982, then increasing to the 32-nation format in 1998, before becoming a 48-team competition for next summer's World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.

A 64-team competition would mean more than 30 per cent of FIFA 211 national teams would compete.

The idea has drawn opposition. UEFA president and FIFA vice-president Aleksander Ceferin described it as a “bad idea”, saying it would be damaging for the tournament but also for its impact on the qualification stage, which would have further reduced jeopardy.

CONCACAF president Victor Montagliani, a FIFA vice-president, expressed his opposition to the idea, saying: “It's not a great idea. We haven't even kicked the ball for the 48 (team format), and obviously they can study all they want, but it just doesn't feel right.”

Any decision to expand the tournament will need to be debated and approved by the FIFA Council.

The 2030 tournament is FIFA's most sprawling to date, as it will be hosted across three continents and six countries. It is set to be shared across Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina, who will each have one game at the start of the event, before the remainder of the schedule is split across Spain, Portugal and Morocco.

This workaround, however, has been deemed insufficient by the South Americans. Their continent has hosted only one recent men's World Cup, when Brazil was awarded the 2014 competition. The most recent before that was in Argentina in 1978. In the intervening years, Europe has hosted five tournaments, while Asia has hosted two.

CONMBEOL's minimal involvement in the 2030 competition has the potential to lock them out of the 2034 and 2038 World Cups due to FIFA's confederation rotation principle, which means a confederation must allow two World Cups to pass before it can once again be a host. It remains to be seen how stringently this is applied as World Cups become larger and cast across more countries and continents.

The six-nation, three-continent tournament for 2030 was perceived by many as being a useful outcome for Saudi Arabia, which secured a clear path to 2034 as three confederations (UEFA, CONMEBOL and CAF) were locked out by hosting 2030, while CONCACAF nations were unable to bid for 2034 due to hosting the North American World Cup in 2026.

However, the South Americans have now alighted upon their idea to convince FIFA to expand the 2030 edition to 64 teams. Multiple people close to the discussions, all of whom wished to remain anonymous to protect relationships, confirmed the idea was formally pushed during meetings in Trump Tower on Tuesday. The precise details of a 64-team format remain to be confirmed, but in the meeting, Dominguez suggested that Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay could all host a group each within the competition.

Those present posted small snippets of the meeting on Instagram Tuesday night.

Dominguez, in a video released on his account, said: “It cannot pass by as just another event, it cannot be a normal World Cup. We see this as a once-in-a-100 year opportunity.”

He posted a video from the streets of Manhattan where he said he was entering a “super-important” meeting and said he hoped to emerge with news that could impact the football world.

Pena, Paraguay's president, later posted a video, in which he is shown in the meeting saying: “We want to challenge ourselves. Encourage us to dream and dream big. I say it with great humility but huge responsibility: Paraguay stands ready. It wants to be a protagonist.”

Infantino, in the same video, appears to give encouragement. He tells the room: “Today, we really start working together as a team to make history. Working together to see how we can do something the world will not forget, because the people deserve it.”

When asked by The Athletic about Tuesday's meetings, FIFA referred to its position in March, where it said it had a duty to analyze any proposal made at a FIFA Council meeting.

At the age of 36, Zhang Shuai is thriving on court and embracing her role as a "tennis auntie" to the younger generation.

After Zhang Shuai thrilled the Diamond Court crowd with a 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 comeback win over qualifier Anastasia Zakharova in the China Open first round, the home favorite was understandably upbeat.

Beijing: Scores | Draws | Order of play

"I'm still very exciting on the court, very exciting back to the home tournament, very exciting play on Diamond Court," the 36-year-old said. Her secret? The wide array of dumplings and other delicacies in the player restaurant has been a welcome change. Usually, Zhang's search for a satisfying meal means bypassing tournament food -- “similar because so healthy,” as she put it -- in favor of Chinese eateries worldwide. In Beijing, she's been able to feast.

"Some tournament every day same, same, same," she said. "From qualies to the final, you have to stay there three weeks in the Grand Slam. You couldn't eat every day same, you know? Here, oh my God, before the match, I eat a big dinner. During the match, even three set, I still feeling full so I have full energy. I know I can beat her because I am still full energy, you know?

"Very important for player what you eat. I mean, healthy very important, but what you like more important - for me."

Fueled by good food, Zhang's win over Zakharova ("We both play really fast and early -- that's the great tennis, I like very much the tennis like this") was a full-circle moment for her. This time last year, she memorably snapped a 24-match losing streak, and went all the way to the quarterfinals -- a result that has helped re-establish her on tour, with a singles ranking of No. 112 and a doubles position of No. 14 this week.

That experience is one of many that mean Zhang is perfectly placed to be a mentor to younger Chinese up-and-coming talents -- the tennis version of the quintessential auntie figure in Asian culture. Her role as an elder of the sport is one she embraces.

"When I was practicing at the Diamond Court, somebody told me, 'I watched you when I was in elementary school, and now I'm in college,'" she said. "It just proves that I've been playing a long time."

That's why, when she sees young players struggle, Zhang is empathetic.

"When I see them, they're always full of panic, have a panicked face," she said. "They are anxious. Many uncertainties. I have gone through so much. I will be able to maintain a calm mindset. You cannot force this level of calm on a very young player.

"Talk about the Chinese classic journey to the west. You talk to those people when they start the journey. Of course, it will be quite different when they finish the journey. The only thing you can do is to encourage the young players. You just say positive things: 'I see you improve a lot every day.'"

China's quarterfinal loss to Italy at last week's Billie Jean King Cup Finals was one occasion on which Zhang had to put her best pep talks into practise. On home soil, both Yuan Yue and Wang Xinyu both led their singles rubbers by a set and a break, only to be reeled in by Elisabetta Cocciaretto and Jasmine Paolini respectively.

A post shared by Billie Jean King Cup (@billiejeankingcup)

"After the BJK Cup, two girls were blaming themselves," Zhang said. "I said to them, 'You didn't fail, we're just one step closer to success. Every success is based on rounds of failures.' I tell them, 'You're great, you did a good job. Look at yourself. You are just one step away from victory. It was easy in the quarterfinals and semifinals. We were this close to victory.'

"They were reviewing this point and that point. Just forget them. Sometimes when I finish a match, I just forget those moments because there's no way for you to return to that moment. If you don't take this option, other people won't do it. This is tennis. This is professional sport. What we can do is to make tomorrow better."

That's a lesson directly taken from Zhang's own ups and downs. Twelve months ago, she was considering retirement. Now, the "motivation for battle" is burning strongly again, and she can't envisage stopping.

"I know I can play well -- last year I'm not sure," she said. "That's why I always talking to all the girls, 'You much better than you thought. You have to trust yourself. You have to believe yourself because everyone better than you thought.'"

Learner Tien, Dino Prizmic and Shang Juncheng all earned victories on the ATP Tour last week in Hangzhou and Chengdu, respectively, increasing their chances of playing at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, held from 17-21 December in Jeddah.

Tien cemented his third-placed position in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah with a quarter-final run at the ATP 250 hard-court event in Hangzhou. The 19-year-old American defeated Mariano Navone and Giulio Zeppieri before he lost to eventual finalist Valentin Royer. Tien is hoping to make his second appearance at the 20-and-under event after reaching the title match last year.

Fourth-placed Prizmic captured his third ATP Tour match win of the season at the event in Chengdu. The Croatian, who has lifted two ATP Challenger Tour trophies in 2025, defeated Cincinnati semi-finalist Terence Atmane and then pushed Top 10 star Lorenzo Musetti to three sets in the second round. Prizmic is aiming to make his debut in Jeddah.

China's Shang continued his comeback from injury with a first-round win against Zizou Bergs in Chengdu. The 20-year-old lefty returned to Tour at the end of July in Toronto after missing the first six months of the season due to a foot injury.

Shang is 18th in the Live Race To Jeddah and will need a couple of deep runs in the next eight weeks to move into qualification contention. This week, he is playing at the ATP 500 event in Beijing and opens against Arthur Cazaux.

Fifth-placed Alexander Blockx, sixth-placed Nicolai Budkov Kjaer and eighth-placed Martin Landaluce are in Challenger Tour action this week in Orleans, while seventh-placed Nishesh Basavareddy lost in the opening round of qualifying in Beijing.

The world No. 2 vowed to be less “predictable” after suffering a four-set defeat to Carlos Alcaraz.ByDavid KanePublished Sep 24, 2025 copy_link

Published Sep 24, 2025

Jannik Sinner appears to be making good on his promise to become more unpredictable on the tennis court court, the former world No. 1 discussing changes to his practice repertoire in the wake of a 2025 US Open final defeat to Carlos Alcaraz.“We've been reflecting a lot to that final,” Sinner said in a pre-tournament press conference at this week's China Open. “We are working on new things. We are changing a lot of small things where I'm thinking of now.

It was a stark admission from the 24-year-old Italian who otherwise enjoyed a remarkable follow-up to his breakthrough 2024 season, winning two more Grand Slam trophies—including a first Wimbledon title over Alcaraz—and reaching the final of all four major tournaments in 2025. He also maintained a 65-week stretch atop the ATP rankings despite missing three months of tournaments due to a suspension for an anti-doping rule violation incurred last spring.Still, Sinner feels there's room for improvement, particularly against Alcaraz, who has become primary rival and leads their head-to-head, 9-5.“I'm trying to be more prepared for the next match what I will play against him,” Sinner said in New York. “It also, I feel like, depends how you arrive to play against Carlos. You know, one thing is when the scoreline, you know, matches before are comfortable but you always do the same things, like I did, for example, during this tournament, you know, I didn't make one serve-volley, didn't use a lot of drop shots, and then you arrive to a point where you play against Carlos where you have to go out of the comfort zone.”

Sinner is the top seed in Beijing, as Alcaraz has opted not to defend his title and instead compete at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships in Tokyo. The Italian will open against Marin Cilic in the first round.Might fans see a new Sinner on court against the 2014 US Open champion?“It's just a question of time,” Sinner said of his tactical tweaks. “Let's see how long I take it. I don't know how much I'm able to do it on actual match court because one thing is practice and one thing is match. Let's see.“Yeah, I'm very motivated. It's great to work on something new, then we see how this ends up. We always try to move forward. One step in front is always better than two steps back. Let's see what we can do.”

“This project means a lot to me because it combines my experience as an athlete with the chance to genuinely support young talent,” Swiatek went on to write on her official website.“Tennis has made me recognizable, and with that I've gained the ability to influence issues that really matter to me. I want to use this opportunity to help make the world a better place—sometimes on a small scale, sometimes on a larger one. I can't help everyone who needs support, but I'll do everything I can, on and off the court, to make things at least a little better."Meanwhile, Sinner's namesake foundation officially launched last Thursday with an event in Milan that was attended by 100 people. The Jannik Sinner Foundation will collaborate with the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), the world's largest fund dedicated to improving educational opportunities in lower-income countries, as well as Südtirol Sporthilfe, a non-profit that supports young athletes through funding, mentorship and development.

“I've been lucky to pursue my passion through tennis, but I know millions of children never get the chance to follow their dreams because they don't have access to school,” Sinner said in event remarks. “Standing here tonight, I see the project is finally alive, and we are ready to help children realize their dreams.”

Abbi Pulling reviews the Baku Grand Prix on The Cooldown Room

Race Recap: Azerbaijan

Esteban Ocon and Ollie Bearman give their verdicts on how the Azerbaijan Grand Prix went for Haas.

Haas did not manage to score any points in Azerbaijan, with Ollie Bearman the higher placed of their two drivers in 12th. Esteban Ocon followed him home in 14th after an eventful race that saw the Frenchman suffer contact off the line.

Ocon's weekend had already been compromised by a disqualification in Qualifying for a technical infringement, meaning he started from last. A good getaway saw him fighting with Nico Hulkenberg, but unfortunately the duo collided.

That led to an immediate pit stop due to a puncture, and with the Safety Car out after Oscar Piastri's crash, Haas saw an opportunity to try something different. Having started on the hard tyre, Ocon was fitted with some mediums before coming back in the next lap for more hards.

That gave him 49 laps to try and survive – and thrive – on the C4 compound. He was asked afterwards whether the early collision hampered his race.

“Luckily it didn't – I think for both our races. At least I didn't have heavy damage,” he explained. “It was just a small touch, and it touched the wheels mainly, which was a good thing.

“It was a good start; we tried a really aggressive strategy, which at the end made me lose out quite a lot. So, a bit of a shame on that part. We will review – it has been a difficult weekend for us.

“I think there are a lot of things we can improve for next weekend and this is what we will look out for in Singapore.”

Haas had looked fast at points in practice, with both drivers flirting with the top 10. As such, hopes had been high going into Qualifying, only for Ocon to exit in Q1 before Bearman crashed out in Q2. Those were just the latest in a series of issues for Haas, which Ocon wants to see rectified moving forwards.

“Yesterday [we had] a brake problem, in Monza we had an issue with the front end of the car really that was quite big. So, we just need to enter weekends and have a clean sweep and no issues, and a healthy weekend really. This is what we are all asking for.”

As for Bearman, he knew that Q2 crash was costly as it meant a P15 starting slot on a day where there was only one race retiree, and limited options to move forward.

“Qualifying was tough this weekend; I did a mistake in Q2 that meant I didn't put a lap on the board. Of course, it was very tricky conditions but that is no excuse. So yeah, just need some improvements [needed] for Singapore,” was his take.

“It was a good race overall, we made a good comeback, had really good pace. But starting 15th, lost a few places on the early laps with the Safety Car restart and after that I was really stuck.

“In the first stint, I lost a lot of time stuck behind [Franco] Colapinto and [Lance] Stroll, and after that it was really damage limitation. The car was quick but I couldn't do much with it.”

Haas head to Singapore sitting ninth in the standings, 11 points behind Kick Sauber.

Abbi Pulling reviews the Baku Grand Prix on The Cooldown Room

Race Recap: Azerbaijan

Mark Hughes and illustrator Giorgio Piola delve into the factors that have given Red Bull a well-balanced car across recent races.

The Max Verstappen/Red Bull resurgence of the last two races has inevitably led to speculation about whether this winning form can be extended beyond just the outlying low-downforce demands of Monza and Baku.

Team boss Laurent Mekies was urging caution of that idea in Baku, saying: “The people back at the factory have been working so hard in trying to understand what has been limiting us with this car. We have been developing our understanding on this and this has been helping.

As viewers of the ceremony know, first-time Emmy's host Nate Bargatze came up with a novel (if mildly controversial) method to get award recipients to cut their acceptance speeches short at this year's show: Every second winners went over their allotted 45-second window, Bargatze would deduct a thousand dollars from a planned $100,000 donation he intended to make to the Boys & Girls Club Of America. As viewers of the show also know, the gesture backfired from a couple of different angles. Reviewers of the show weren't wild about seeing that kind of social pressure applied to getting winners to wrap it up more quickly—overages might irritate CBS, the network airing the show, but a lot of folks like the speeches. But also, it essentially failed as a deterrent: By the end of the night, the number was actually more than $50,000 in the hole, which caused CBS to step in and cover the original $100,000 donation, while Bargatze pledged another $250,000 of his own money.

﻿

Which wasn't exactly how it was supposed to go down, according to an appearance that the comic made on his own Nateland podcast this week. Saying he “almost sent an email out” ahead of the show to try to explain his intent, Bargatze says he initially envisioned the studios stepping up—or being encouraged to step up by their stars—to cover when talent overran their time. “If someone was giving these long speeches, I just thought they could be like, ‘and Netflix is gonna cover my overage,'” Bargatze explained, saying it would have allowed stars to “Go long, but then be a hero.”

To be clear, Bargatze isn't complaining about having to pony up himself: He's one of the most successful stand-ups on the planet, with Billboard estimating that he's made something north of $80 million from touring alone. (He did, after all, end up donating significantly more than he initially said he would at the outset of the show, basically just to give the whole thing a feel-good ending.) In the podcast, he seems more lightly annoyed that nobody else was on his wavelength with the bit, even while asserting that both CBS and audiences at home enjoyed the concept.

There is a freewheeling energy to a Stephen Kostanski movie, a feeling that you've walked in on a group of friends partaking in a grand game of make-believe. It's not that what was filmed was spontaneous, but that there's the sense that it wasn't filmed at all. It's just beaming into its audience's heads, a cosmic signal from a long-abandoned video store. Kostanski's deliberate and detailed aesthetic choices are proof that there's an encompassing plan, but the playful daring emanating from each of his low-budget projects also feels tougher to sustain as the films get larger. With Deathstalker, Kostanski attempts to bring his loose, gleeful style to the sword and sorcery genre, and mostly succeeds, giving us another midnight movie essential.

Based on the 1983 Roger Corman film of the same name, Kostanski's version follows Deathstalker (action staple Daniel Bernhardt), a warrior and scavenger living in a world beset by war. He spends his days roaming battlefields and picking valuables off the corpses. One day, he finally picks up something he shouldn't have—an amulet with a dark history tied to the kingdom's oldest enemies—and he literally can't get rid of it. It'll keep coming back to him until he dies or until he performs an arcane spell to break the curse. So, with the help of a flirty thief (Christina Orjalo) and a diminutive sorcerer (played in costume by Laurie Field, voiced by Patton Oswalt), Deathstalker sets out to break this curse, and unknowingly walks into a date with destiny. 

There are a lot of classic sword-and-sorcery beats here, from the reluctant hero to the quest for redemption to a weird little guy named “Doodad” just following you around, helping out with magic. Those nostalgic for 1970s and 1980s fantasy films of this stripe, for the age of Beastmaster, will find lots to love here. But Deathstalker is at its best when Bernhardt plays the title role like a put-upon, working-class grave robber just trying to get a monkey off his back, and Kostanski knows when to step back and let that irreverence shine through.

Irreverence is a key part of the Psycho Goreman filmmaker's toolkit, and Deathstalker‘s weak point is that these moments have never felt less at home. Certain scenes featuring grand pronouncements from villains while the heroes are talking like regular people are a chuckle-worthy juxtaposition, but Kostanski's script wants to have its cake and eat it too when it comes to serious fantasy and scattershot comedy.

Yet these growing pains, as a filmmaker stretches his shtick into a new genre, are often overshadowed by the sheer force of the primary-colored mayhem erupting onscreen. Centering Bernhardt's skills as a stunt performer and martial artist, set piece after set piece explodes with color, movement, and creatures that both evoke the 1980s and strive to push the throwback vibe to new extremes. The fights are fun, the monsters are beautifully realized, and the sheer number of genre tropes this film packs into its 100 minutes is enough to make the most battleworn Dungeon Master drop their jaw.

Though his pop culture homages are often what get viewers in the door, Kostanski has always been after something more than revitalizing old aesthetics. Like his low-budget heroes before him, the filmmaker captures the innate urgency that comes from making something with your hands and beaming it out in the world. There's still something electric about being in the trenches of the indie genre world, and Deathstalker proves that power is still there even as the films get a little bit bigger.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


	More than 100 former ABC News employees including Sam Donaldson, Tom Bettag and Judy Muller have signed on to a letter urging Disney CEO Bob Iger to step it up when it comes to publicly defending journalists under political attacks and the company itself against government pressure.


	“We want to acknowledge and commend your decision to reinstate Jimmy Kimmel's show,” the ABC News employees wrote in the letter, first reported by CNN. “It was the right call and an important statement that political intimidation should not dictate ABC's programming. This action reflects the values that have long defined The Walt Disney Company.

	











	“Yet, it must be just the first step in a concerted effort to defend free speech and press freedom against political intimidation. The $16 million settlement with Donald Trump, combined with the absence of a strong public defense of ABC News journalists under attack, has emboldened Administration efforts to intimidate the press.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Also signing on to the letter was Kayce Freed Jennings, the widow of World News Tonight anchor Peter Jennings. The letter was organized by Lisa Stark, a former correspondent, and Ian Cameron, a former executive producer, per CNN.


	The letter states: “Your legacy includes a reputation as a staunch defender of the essential role of journalism in a healthy democracy. We urge you now to reaffirm that legacy by: Making clear that ABC News—and Disney—will not be silenced or intimidated by political pressure; Publicly and unequivocally defending ABC journalists against political attacks; Aggressively pushing back against government efforts to undermine the First Amendment.”

	











	In December, just before Donald Trump took office, ABC settled his defamation lawsuit for $16 million. Trump sued the network and George Stephanopoulos over the This Week anchor's claim that the then-former president had been found liable for rape by a New York jury. In fact, Trump was found liable to sexual assault.


	Last week, hours after FCC chairman Brendan Carr warned ABC stations over a remark that Jimmy Kimmel made on his ABC late-night show, the network pulled Jimmy Kimmel Live! indefinitely. But that action generated a backlash against Disney, with Barack Obama and former CEO Michael Eisner calling on corporate executives to stand up to the administration.


	A Disney spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.


	Just before Kimmel returned to the air on Tuesday, Trump posted a new threat to the network, vowing to take action alleging that his show was an “illegal campaign contribution.” “I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do,” Trump wrote.


	The Federal Election Commission has a news media exemption, and a campaign finance expert, Saurav Ghosh, director of federal campaign finance reform at the Campaign Legal Center, said that the network and Disney also would fall under an exemption for commercial activity. “There is no indication the decision [to bring Kimmel back] is being driven by anything other than a commercial decision. That is not even close to a campaign contribution,” Ghosh said.

backbone does not magically grow. I think it's laughable to expect backbones from executives who were promoted for lacking it.

In the ABC markets where Sinclair and Nextar refused to air Kimmel, Iger should have offered up the show to other competing networks.  

Watch how fast they'd suddenly want the show back.

Hasn't this ship sailed? What about the $16 million settlement with Donald Trump? That's caving to political pressure.

Well let's see, Trump clearly doesn't like Jimmy or anyone who pokes fun at him,so y is it funny when Trump nicknames people and thinks it's funny and calls other people criminals, with ni evidence what so ever,one person is joking and the other is being a bully, so I think our president has more important things to do. So all his yes people around him should concentrate on that and let's actually make America great again,we have to stop and start living like the constitution was written.  After all we are the people!!!!

Bob looks confused why he has to choose principles over money.

After giving extensive notes on the script and reviewing daily shot lists, the team offered her producing credit on all three installments.


							By 

	Brian Davids


Writer


	We've all watched the credits to a movie and passed some degree of judgment when the star of the movie is also listed as a producer of some sort. We'll sometimes jump to the conclusion that it must be a vanity credit, one that was offered as sweetener in order to close an actor's deal. But in the case of Madelaine Petsch's The Strangers trilogy, her executive producer title is well-merited.


	Opening Sept. 26 in movie theaters, The Strangers: Chapters 2 once again chronicles Petsch's Maya as she's pursued across a small Oregon town by the titular serial killers. Petsch, along with director Renny Harlin and producer Courtney Solomon, managed to shoot an entire trilogy in just 52 days. That figure ultimately changed once they addressed fan criticism of Chapter 1, adding three-to-four weeks of additional filming on Chapter 2 and 3. But throughout each phase of photography, Petsch imposed her will in order to better the product on the screen.

	“I did not have the credit at first. I came on set and said, ‘Hey guys, would you be willing to listen to [some script thoughts]?'” Petsch tells The Hollywood Reporter. “And that ultimately became [producer] Courtney Solomon and I editing the script every day after set, going through shot lists with Renny [Harlin] and being more sewn into the fabric of the story in a producorial way. So they offered me the EP credit; it was not a vanity credit that I got.”

	










			Popular on THR		







	Petsch adds that vanity credits are often a necessity for smaller productions.


	“Usually, they'll do that to pay actors less money because they don't have a lot of money,” Petsch says. “They'll be like, ‘We'll give you an EP credit, which will help you, but it's a vanity credit.' So I got offered this credit because I was actually doing the work.”


	Below, during a recent conversation with THR, Petsch also previews the concluding chapter of her Strangers trilogy and why she hopes it'll break the fall release pattern of Chapter 1 and 2.


	***


When we spoke last year for The Strangers: Chapter 1, I asked you what scene will likely linger for years to come, and you said you'd tell me after I saw Chapter II. Was it the wild boar sequence? 


	That's the one! 


I have a feeling that the boar sequence is really important to Maya's overall arc. Am I correct or incorrect to draw that conclusion?


	Yeah, you're very, very, very, very correct in that conclusion. 


What struck me most about Chapter 2 is how little dialogue there is. It's partly the nature of Maya being alone and on the run from silent attackers. Does no dialogue make your job all the more difficult, since you have to sell each moment physically?


	There's pros and cons to it. It definitely is more challenging because you just don't really do it that often in this industry. You either have a scene partner to do no dialogue off of, giving you something to react to, or you've got dialogue to rely on. I would say there's probably an hour of this film with no dialogue in it, and it's just a different challenge that's not done very often. So there's definitely pros and cons to both, and it's really fun to flex that muscle.

	











For example, there's an interesting moment where she silently takes inventory of her wounds and scars in front of a mirror. What was on your mind in that moment?


	It's the first time that Maya sees herself and sees the physical manifestation of everything she's been through. It's the moment where it all hits her. It's like, “This is my reality now.” When you're in this state of fight or flight, and survival, you're not really thinking, “I can't believe this is happening to me.” You're just thinking, “I've got to survive.” So in that moment when she stops and catches herself in the mirror, she's taking inventory of every single attack and every single thing she's been through in the last 24-to-48 hours that has changed her innately as a human being. And ultimately, I think she is, in real time, saying goodbye to that final piece of humanity. 


Lionsgate released a clip of the morgue scene where Maya encounters her deceased fiancé (Froy Gutierrez's Ryan). Was that dummy Froy? Or real Froy?


	Real Froy! He's very good at being still. It wasn't as weird as you might think. It really didn't affect us at all. When you're shooting a movie like this, that's the least of your concerns. 


You told me previously that you helped punch up the 278-page script for all three chapters and suggested scenes like the shower scene in Chapter 1. Was that your way of making the most of your EP credit? 












	I actually did not have the credit at first. I was asked to be an actor in the film, and I wholeheartedly said yes. I then came on set and said, “Hey guys, I have some script thoughts. Would you be willing to listen to them?” And that ultimately became [producer] Courtney Solomon and I editing the script every day after set, going through shot lists with Renny [Harlin] and being more sewn into the fabric of the story in a producorial way. So they offered me the EP credit; it was not a vanity credit that I got. Usually, they'll do that to pay actors less money because they don't have a lot of money. They'll be like, “We'll give you an EP credit, which will help you, but it's a vanity credit.” So I got offered this credit because I was actually doing the work. 


The financial success of Chapter 1 afforded you and your team 23-to-28 days of additional photography. Are you glad that you got to go back and fine tune Chapter 2 and 3?


	Absolutely. It made both films amazing and way stronger. Chapter 2 had 8 days [of additional photography] and Chapter 3 had 15.


There's a trailer for Chapter 3 in the mid-credits of Chapter 2, and there's a very tantalizing glimpse at what's to come. What's your best elevator pitch for Chapter 3?


Chapter 3 is a face-off between the two main characters where you start struggling with the idea of who the protagonist is and who the antagonist really is. 


The trailer has a moment where my jaw dropped about what was revealed, but then I noticed a little detail that made me second-guess what I saw. So I'm very curious how everything is going to shake out.












	It's so funny because somebody else brought that moment up and didn't notice that, so I was like, “Go back and watch her wrists again.”


Do you expect Chapter 3 to follow the fall release pattern of Chapter 1 and 2?


	If it [goes] our way, then hopefully it'll be sooner. That would be the goal. It is basically done. But it's about whatever Lionsgate feels and what fits into their release schedule the best. It's also about what other movies are already releasing during those weekends, so that's up to the Lionsgate Gods. All I know is that we are done, and we are ready to show it as soon as possible.


At the Chapter 1 premiere, your former Riverdale castmates, Lili Reinhart and Camila Mendes, showed up to support you, and I thought that was a really lovely gesture. It's so easy to lose track of friends as time passes, so did the three of you make a pact to not let that happen?


	Those two girls are still my absolute best friends in the whole world. It can go one of two ways when you shoot a show like that, and it went the right way with us. We all came up together in a really intense environment, having shot up to a world that we'd never been in before: fame and a successful TV show. We had each other to constantly lean on in any scenario. We still call each other to be like, “I am doing this movie. Have you heard of this director?” And someone will say, “Oh, I met with him.” And someone will ask, “What was your experience like?” We're a unit. No matter what we do or where we are, we always support each other. It's rare in Hollywood to find people who don't feel competitive with you and support you so unabashedly, so I'm really lucky to have found my people. 

	











You also starred in and EP'd a romcom that's coming out on Oct. 8. Was Maintenance Required meant to be a palate cleanser after all the fictional trauma you endured in your Strangers trilogy?


	(Laughs.) It was not meant to be a palate cleanser. I like variety. Variety is the spice of life. I think actors want to do everything, at least I do. So I love the idea of being in an Amazon romcom where I get to play a mechanic and do something completely different. As an artist, it was just fun, and I think it'll be fun for audiences. I never knew they were going to come out this close together, to be honest. But I think it'll be fun for audiences to be able to go see me in this horror film — and go through the PTSD of it — before coming home to cuddle up and watch something that's sweet and cozy.

Kate Gosselin is stepping into a new chapter of life — and she's doing it with a familiar face by her side.

According to Page Six, the former “Jon & Kate Plus 8” star is dating Steve Neild, her longtime former bodyguard.

The pairing has sparked warm reactions from fans who remember Neild as a steady presence during Gosselin's early years in the spotlight. He became her bodyguard in 2008 and has been photographed with the reality TV star many times throughout the years.

The relationship marks Gosselin's most significant romance since her split from Jon Gosselin in 2009.

The star was married to Jon Gosselin from 1999 to 2009. They had twins Madelyn and Cara, as well as sextuplets Aaden, Collin, Joel, Hannah, Alexis and Leah.

For years, she kept her dating life almost entirely private, focusing on raising her eight children while managing the challenges of reality TV fame.

Now, reports suggest that her bond with Neild has grown beyond the professional, blossoming into something more personal and supportive.

A source told Page Six the two are living together and have been an item for a while.

“There's no doubt that Kate is crazy about him … things are serious, they have discussed wedding plans and moving on that next stage,” the source told the outlet.

While neither Gosselin nor Neild has spoken publicly about the relationship, the buzz reflects a hopeful shift for the television personality.

Hints of Gosselin's new romance surfaced earlier in the week when she surprised fans during a TikTok Q&A session.

Answers to some of your burning questions!🤣 #travel #QandA 

Smiling as she addressed the camera, she admitted she had been seeing someone quietly for “a little over a year.”

“And finally, ‘Are you dating?'” she read aloud from a fan's question. “The answer … is actually, finally, yes.”

Without naming names, Gosselin explained her partner is “somebody that I've known for a really long time,” adding that she is “super, super happy.”

She described him as private, someone who prefers to avoid TikTok appearances, but hinted fans might see him in the future.

“You perhaps will catch a peep of him here and there or once in a while going forward,” she said.

Fans reacted to the video and said, “I heard it was Steve is this true?? He was handsome lol!!!”

Another added, “I'm so happy for you , you deserve to be with someone who makes you happy.”

“Wonderful news all around! I'm so happy for you Kate! You deserve so much happiness and joy,” one user gushed.

The 'One Battle After Another' star opened up about some terrible advice a talent agent once gave him. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


Leonardo DiCaprio opened up about some terrible advice he once received from a talent agent.


	The actor appeared on the New Heights podcast along with his One Battle After Another co-star Benicio del Toro and discussed the new film and their experiences working with iconic directors. 




	When asked about shocking moments in their career, DiCaprio said he had a “fun one” from when he was a very young actor. DiCaprio's first agent secured him a headshot photo and then gave him a surprising piece of news.

	“I finally got an agent and they said: ‘Your name is too ethnic,” I go, What do you mean?' They go, ‘No, too ethnic. They're never going to hire you. Your new name is Lenny Williams. ‘What's Lenny Williams?' ‘We took your middle name and made it your last name and now [your first] name is Lenny.' And my dad saw [the headshot photo the agent took], he ripped it up, and said, ‘Over my dead body.'” 

	











	At this point, del Toro gestured to himself and said “Benny Del,” suggesting that he, too, received similar advice early in his career. 


	When the duo is asked what was “on their Mount Rushmore of movies,” DiCaprio listed East of Eden, Taxi Driver and 2001: A Space Odyssey, while del Toro cited Papillon and On the Waterfront.


	Asked about pieces of advice they were given, DiCaprio recalled being on the set of This Boy's Life when he was 16, working across from Robert De Niro when director Michael Caton-Jones advised: “‘Watch [De Niro]. Pain is temporary, film is forever.' That's the note that hit me the hardest that stayed with me forever.”


	The duo was also asked if they could act in one role that the other starred in, which would it be? DiCaprio said Sicaro, “that shit was badass.” While del Toro said, The Wolf of Wall Street.

	











	Director Paul Thomas Anderson's One Battle After Another is receiving terrific reviews and is set to open in theaters on Friday.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: In an eight-figure deal, understood to be the biggest out of this year's TIFF market so far, new U.S. distributor Row K has taken rights to the Cliffhanger reboot starring Pierce Brosnan and Lily James.


	The reimagining of the 1993 classic, directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Carry-On), is currently in post-production and is being lined for a 3,000 screen stateside theatrical release in 2026. 


	The film will follow a seasoned mountaineer, Ray Cooper (Brosnan), who operates a luxury chalet in the Dolomites with his daughter, Sydney. During a weekend trip with a billionaire's son, they are targeted by a gang of kidnappers. Ray's other daughter Naomi (James), still haunted by a past climbing accident, witnesses the attack and escapes. To save her family, she must confront her fears and fight for survival.

	The pic is written by Ana Lily Amirpour, Sascha Penn, Mark Bianculli and Melanie Toast. Producers include Lars Sylvest of Thank You Pictures, Joe Neurauter of Supernix, Thorsten Schumacher of Rocket Science, and Neal Moritz and Toby Jaffe.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The acquisition was negotiated on behalf of the filmmakers by CAA Media Finance, which is representing domestic rights. Rocket Science is handling international sales.


	The deal marks Row K's third buy out of TIFF since its launch in August, following Gus Van Sant's Dead Man's Wire starring Bill Skarsgård, Dacre Montgomery, Cary Elwes, Myha'la, Colman Domingo and Al Pacino, and Tom Dean and Mac Eldridge's Charlie Harper starring Nick Robinson and Emilia Jones. 


	“Cliffhanger is an exciting addition to Row K's growing slate and a clear example of the kind of event-level films we are bringing to the marketplace,” said MCT Principals and Row K Co-Chairman Christopher Woodrow and Raj Singh. “We are building a pipeline of star-driven titles made for the big screen, and Cliffhanger checks every box. Our third acquisition underscores the momentum we're generating and the type of ambitious, audience-forward distribution model Row K was designed to deliver.”

	











	Added Row K President Megan Colligan: “What drew me to Jaume Collet-Serra's Cliffhanger is how it blends the adrenaline and scale of a classic action movie with a fresh, modern twist – exactly the experience that younger audiences are showing up for. The original Cliffhanger was celebrated for its mountain cinematography, and this reimagining honors that legacy with sweeping backdrops across Europe – the result is a stunning production built for theaters.”


	As we revealed during the TIFF market, there are early stage talks about a sequel to the reboot. The 1993 original, which took $255M global, starred Sylvester Stallone with Renny Harlin directing.


	Row K, backed by Media Capital Technologies, takes its name from the seat often considered the best view in the theater. The company recently appointed Mo Rhim as Chief Revenue Officer, Ben Carlson as Chief Marketing Officer and Steve Garrett as Head of Distribution and Acquisitions.

Control of the venue is at the heart of a countersuit filed against Insomniac Events by three Miami club operators.


The legal battle between dance music giant Insomniac Events and a trio of Miami club operators is heating up with a new countersuit that accuses Insomniac and its CEO Pasquale Rotella of “predatory tactics and greed.”


	The dispute stems from a soured partnership between Insomniac, the global dance music events company partly owned by Live Nation, and Miami club and festival operators David Sinopoli, Davide L. Danese and Jose Gabriel Coloma Cano, who are best known for operating the city's famed Club Space venue and their work on the city's III Points festival.


	Insomniac brought a lawsuit last month against Sinopoli, Danese and Coloma Cano (referred to as “CDD” in legal papers), claiming the group tried to “bully” its way into more control over upstart Miami club Factory Town. But in counterclaims filed Wednesday (Sept. 24), CDD says it's actually Insomniac and Rotella who brought down their partnership with bad faith business practices. The countersuit is seeking unspecified monetary damages.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Insomniac and Rotella's deceit in the Factory Town partnership and their failure to abide by the settlement agreement are unfortunately only the latest instances of Insomniac and Rotella's unscrupulous business dealings and conduct,” reads the countersuit. “Rotella and Insomniac are well-known in the electronic music industry for their greed and mistreatment of business partners, colleagues and employees alike.” 


	The countersuit cites social media comments critiquing Insomniac, as well as a 2012 criminal indictment that charged Rotella with bribing an event manager at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The charges were later dismissed, with Rotella pleading no contest to a misdemeanor conflict of interest and getting probation.


	“Rotella is not just a criminal and a fraud. He is also insufferable to work with,” write CDD's lawyers. “The CDD parties have had the misfortune of witnessing and experiencing first-hand Rotella's cruelty, self-centeredness and volatility towards his business partners and/or employees.”


	Reached for comment on these new counterclaims on Wednesday, Insomniac's attorney Jordan Shaw says he's confident in their legal position and that CDD's personal attacks are irrelevant.


	“Their counterclaim is exactly what we expected, and the fact that they're relying on social media posts and dropped charges from 20 years ago tells you everything you need to know about their current claims,” says Shaw.


	Insomniac's original lawsuit against CDD claims the promoters made “outrageous demands” last year for more money and control of Factory Town. But the countersuit tells a different story, saying Insomniac “methodically and unilaterally” stripped away CDD's financial and ownership rights with the aim of leaving the promoters “trapped and forced to accept ever-worsening conditions.”  


	According to CDD, the original Factory Town agreement promised them a 49% stake in the venue. But the counterclaim says “Insomniac's and Rotella's actual intent was to gain full control of the Factory Town venue, obtain a lease for the Factory Town property under only Insomniac's name, and then unilaterally rewrite the deal under which the CDD Parties had performed and under which the CDD Parties exceeded all expectations, leaving the CDD Parties with all the work, all the risk, and a drastically reduced upside.”


	The two sides went into mediation this summer and emerged with a settlement, under which Insomniac would buy out CDD for $3 million and assume control of Factory Town. The Insomniac lawsuit alleges the CDD parties have since breached this settlement agreement by interfering in its planning of Factory Town's Hocus Pocus Halloween party and programming for Art Basel Miami in December.


	The countersuit, however, claims Insomniac was actually required to collaborate with CDD on both Hocus Pocus and Art Basel under the settlement. CDD says Insomniac has breached the deal by booking talent without their approval and ignoring myriad emails from CDD, copies of which are included in the suit. 


	In one example, CDD claims Insomniac made an offer to party brand CircoLoco “that represented a 44% increase from the prior year's deal.” CDD objected to this offer, saying that it did “not reflect historical performance, venue capacity, or the reality of our shared structure.” The countersuit alleges that subsequent emails about the details of this deal were ignored by Insomniac.


	CDD's lead attorney, Bruce Weil, said in a statement on Wednesday that his clients have “established themselves as respected and valuable members of Miami's community through years of supporting local artists and boosting the local economy.”


	“It is disappointing that Pasquale Rotella and Insomniac are manipulating the facts by accusing CDD of the exact misconduct they themselves have inflicted, while retaliating against Club Space by attempting to obstruct and undermine CDD's ability to operate and manage it during a period of unprecedented success,” Weil added.


	Insomniac lawyer Shaw, meanwhile, maintains that the language of the settlement agreement and orders from the dispute's mediator, retired judge Michael A. Hanzman, support Insomniac's reading of the agreement.


	“The facts are the facts,” said Shaw. “The Judge Hanzman order attached to the complaints says what it says, and the defendants cannot escape those realities no matter how many Twitter posts they quote in their counterclaim.”

Laila Lockhart Kraner and director Ryan Crego tease the interactive big-screen adaptation of Netflix's hit preschool series, also starring Kristen Wiig and Gloria Estefan.


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


	The Gabby's Dollhouse movie isn't available — yet (as Gabby would say, with emphasis). But now just days away from releasing in movie theaters across the country, Gabby herself wants to tell fans of all ages what to expect when Netflix‘s popular preschool series goes big screen.


	“It's a lot of fun. The little kids are going to stay entertained,” star Laila Lockhart Kraner tells The Hollywood Reporter of DreamWorks Animation‘s first live-action/animated hybrid film, written and directed by Ryan Crego. “They're going to be able to sing and dance. But I also think there's going to be a lot for everybody. Even older members of the family, the parents, too.”

	Kraner, who is now 17, was 12 when she was first cast as Gabby, the live-action girl who uses magic in her cat ears to “pinch in” and shrink herself, along with her favorite stuffed animal, to go inside an animated version of her vibrant dollhouse. Gabby, best pal Pandy and her ensemble of cat-inspired friends — Cakey, MerCat, Carlita, Catrat, Baby Box, Kitty Fairy, Pillow Cat and DJ Catnip — have taken young viewers on 76 episodes and 11 seasons of cat-adventures with the hit Netflix series, all culminating now in Universal Pictures' Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie. (Season 12 will bring six new episodes in November.)


	The 98-minute movie follows Kraner's growing-up Gabby on a road trip with her Grandma Gigi (played by the iconic Gloria Estefan) to “Cat Francisco,” where her dollhouse inadvertently finds its way into the hands of an eccentric cat lady named Vera, who is played by the also iconic Kristen Wiig. Gabby and her Gabby Cats then set off on a real-world/animated adventure to save her dollhouse.

	











	“There's a lot of funny comedy for everybody, and there are a lot of good messages that I think apply to all ages about keeping the magic of play alive,” says Kraner of the movie's takeaways. “I think that's something important for little kids to hear, and also for adults to hear. So it's a lot of fun for the whole family.”


	Kraner says she was on set making an episode of Gabby's Dollhouse a couple of years ago when creators Traci Paige Johnson and Jennifer Twomey first floated the idea of making a Gabby movie to her. “But even then I wasn't sure how big it was going to be, if it was going to go into theaters or not. They just had a couple of concepts,” she recalls. Then, enter animation creator, writer and director Crego, who was approached at a time when Gabby's Dollhouse was playing on loop in his own home.


	“This was my daughter's favorite show. We have every toy. That'd be the coolest thing ever to make her favorite show into a movie. And, my son, who has grown up during the course of making this movie, has also fallen into the Gabby fandom,” Crego tells THR. “There was a period where I would be writing and working on [the movie], and then I'd come downstairs and hear [the show's theme song] Hey, Gabby!“


	Wiig was at the top of their list to play the cat lady villain whose improv brings the biggest laughs (and, according to Crego, also had the crew in stitches). Crego, inspired by his Cuban heritage, said a lightning bolt went off when casting Gabby's Gigi. “We were really lucky that she jumped on board because it's hard to imagine anyone else in that role,” he says of Estefan, who helps expand Gabby's world and also explains its magic. The voice cast also includes Thomas Lennon, Jason Mantzoukas, Ego Nwodim, Kyle Mooney, Melissa Villaseñor and Fortune Feimster.

	











	Crego hopes to create a classic family film that every generation can enjoy together in the theater, but his guiding principle was to maintain the key elements of the series, which often sees Gabby breaking the fourth wall to speak with the audience or encourage dancing and sing-alongs to the catchy soundtrack. (Pre-released songs “Kaleidoscope,” “Gabby Dollhouse World” and “Pinching In” are already available.)


	In fact, the Gabby filmgoing experience, like the series, wants active participation from viewers.


	“We tried really hard to make sure that the core audience of Gabby fans was going to be served first and foremost,” Crego says. “As much as I talk about how the parents are going to love it and adults are going to get something out of it, before anything, it was about the fans of Gabby and finding all the things that make the series so successful, and then bringing more to the screen for a bigger adventure.”


	So Kraner encourages moviegoers of all ages to keep that spirit alive. “Sometimes in movie theaters you're not really supposed to get up, but this is not that case. It's totally allowed!” she says.


	“A big part of the movie theater experience that is so special about Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie is that you're encouraged to go and sing and dance,” she continues. “That's always such a big part of the show that everybody really connects with, so being able to do that in a theater of other little Gabby fans is going to be such a blast. I hope everybody gets dressed up and brings their cat ears. It's supposed to be a fun and inclusive movie experience. The viewer has always been part of the story with Gabby and that's even more important in this movie. We want you to laugh and dance with us.”

Law & Order‘s 25th season will welcome David Ajala (Star Trek: Discovery) as a series regular. He will portray a detective alongside Reid Scott's character, Det. Vincent Riley. The new season premieres on Thursday, September 25, at 8 p.m. ET/PT on NBC and streams the next day on Peacock.


Law & Order is a police procedural and legal drama that gives viewers a look at a case—inspired by real-life crimes “ripped from the headlines”— from the POV of the police and the prosecutors. It's the longest-running law enforcement series on TV.


	The series also stars Tony Goldwyn, Hugh Dancy, Odelya Halevi, Reid Scott, and Maura Tierney. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







Law & Order is produced by Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group, in association with Wolf Entertainment. Executive producers are Dick Wolf, Rick Eid, Alex Hall, and Peter Jankowski.


	Ajala is best known for his portrayal of Cleveland Booker in Star Trek: Discovery. He can next be seen in Netflix's upcoming drama The Woman in Cabin 10. Recently, he starred in the mystery thriller series Nine Bodies in a Mexican Morgue and in the BBC drama series The Jetty, CW's Supergirl, and SYFY's adaptation of George R.R. Martin's 1980 novella “Nightflyers.” Additional TV credits include Black Box, Falling Water, Trex and Flipside, Law & Order: UK, Death in Paradise, Silent Witness, and Dr. Who.

I stopped watching early on, mostly because the two new ADAs are too tame. Thia show needs much more Jack McCoy-style passion.

Maybe this will be the year when the writers stop having the cops call across the street or across the room to a suspect (who never turns out to be guilty), who then bolts, triggering a foot chase that ends with a tackle.

LOL. That's a pet peeve of mine, too.

I hope he stays, but with what this reboot has going on, if he's not gone by season end, someone will be.

I wish more people would question the leadership over this show. I try my hardest to get into it but I just get bored watching or either feel some kind of way negative after. It's like it's been written by political commentator millennials. Plus boss Rick Eid's reputation preceeds him. On SVU he was bad. Chicago PD turned super dark. His FBI work was decent at best. Wolf needs to find new blood to run these shows if he can't get people back like he did Michele Fazekas on SVU.

Ah – I was wondering about that when they previewed the cast and there was no second detective. Hopefully he stays for a while.

This week: Gruesome headlines lead to rising streams for alt-pop hitmaker D4vd, while performers at the Charlie Kirk memorial service and songs featured in a much-anticipated Amazon Prime series finale see gains.

	Following a quick rise and a handful of viral hits, D4vd has been featured in disturbing headlines in recent weeks following the discovery of a dead body in a car reportedly registered to the singer-songwriter. The human remains were uncovered inside an impounded Tesla on Sept. 8, and last Wednesday (Sept. 17), the body was identified as Celeste Rivas Hernandez, a 15-year-old girl who had previously been reported missing and, as Internet sleuths pointed out, had multiple connections to D4vd prior to her disappearance. Although no charges have been brought against the 20-year-old singer, D4vd canceled multiple tour dates without explanation in the following days.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Following the reports, D4vd's overall streams have experienced significant gains — including the viral hit that helped deliver him to the mainstream. From Sept. 18-22, D4vd's catalog earned 30.3 million official on-demand U.S. streams, more than double the total from the previous five-day tracking period (13.8 million streams from Sept. 12-16), according to preliminary data provided by Luminate. Within that total, “Romantic Homicide,” which reached No. 33 on the Hot 100 after going viral in 2022, was among the greatest gainers. From Sept. 12-15, the track earned 2.9 million streams; one week later, that total was 9.4 million (up 224%). “Romantic Homicide” and other D4vd tracks have popped up on the Spotify daily top 50 chart as this tragic story has developed. – JASON LIPSHUTZ












	On Sunday (Sept. 21), a memorial service for the assassinated conservative media figure and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk was held at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Az. — with over 90,000 in attendance, and speakers who included both President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, as well as Kirk's widow Erika. As Kirk had been outspoken in his Christian faith, contemporary Christian music featured prominently in the proceedings — including performances from some of the biggest names in contemporary worship music, paying tribute to Kirk. 


	Several of those performers experienced notable catalog gains following their performances. Brandon Lake, perhaps currently the biggest name in contemporary Christian music following his crossover breakthrough this year with the Hot 100 top 40 hit “Hard Fought Hallelujah,” collected over 4.3 million official on-demand U.S. streams on Monday (Sept. 22), the day after the service, according to preliminary data provided by Luminate. That was up 29% from the 3.4 million he drew the Monday before, and included a 76% gain for “Gratitude,” the 2020 song he performed at the ceremony, to 909,000 streams.


	Similar catalog gains were posted by service performers Cody Carnes (up 7% to 717,000), Kari Jobe (up 27% to 296,000) and Chris Tomlin (up 30% to just over 2 million) on that Monday — while Lee Greenwood's perennial “God Bless the U.S.A.” was up nearly 13% to 59,000 streams. – ANDREW UNTERBERGER


	After seven years, Cardi B's long-awaited sophomore album Am I the Drama?,is finally here — and it's already having quite the impact on streaming. Released on Sept. 19, Drama has earned 78.3 million official on-demand U.S. streams in its first three days of release, according to Luminate. Of that three-day total, the album pulled 35.8 million streams on Sept. 19, 25.4 million on Sept. 20 and another 17 million streams on Sept. 21. The new album also spurred notable gains for the Bronx MC's Grammy-winning debut album, Invasion of Privacy. That set earned 4.15 million official on-demand U.S. streams during Drama's release weekend (Sept. 19-21), marking a 31% increase from the 3.17 million streams it collected the previous weekend (Sept. 12-14). 


Drama is filled with nifty samples, but two particular flips have boosted their original tracks: On the Lizzo-assisted “What's Going On,” Cardi sources 4 Non Blonde's “What's Up,” helped the 1993 track pull over 981,00 official on-demand U.S. streams during Drama's release weekend (Sept. 19-21). That marks a 7% lift from the 914,000 streams the track earned the previous weekend (Sept. 12-14). Placed near the end of the album, “Principal” calls upon Janet Jackson's “The Pleasure Principle,” which reaped 52,000 official on-demand U.S. streams during Drama's release weekend (Sept. 19-21), marking a 30% leap from the 40,2000 streams it pulled the previous weekend (Sept. 12-14). — KYLE DENIS 


	Over three seasons, Amazon Prime's romantic coming-of-age drama series The Summer I Turned Pretty proved itself not only one of the biggest shows of the decade, but one of the most prominent users of music synchs in recent TV history — with synch-tracking website Tunefind listing 104 songs used in its third season alone. That third and final season came to an end last Wednesday (Sept. 17) with 11 synchs used the season finale — all of which of course saw major bumps on streaming following their usage. 

	











	With much of the finale taking place in Paris, multiple French songs were used in the episode, with the biggest gains going to Belgian artist Angele's “Ta Reine” — which was up a whopping 1,130% in official on-demand U.S. streams (to 130,000) over the five days following the episode premiere (Sept. 18-22) compared to the five-day period before (Sept. 12-16), according to preliminary data provided by Luminate. More in the show's typical musical wheelhouse were synchs from Noah Kahan (“Everwhere, Everything,” also featuring Gracie Abrams) and Phoebe Bridgers (“Scott Street”), with the songs rising 45% and 79% to 1.9 million and 1.5 million streams over the same period, respectively.


	But of course, the biggest bumps overall were reserved for the artist who's served as the show's musical north star for essentially its entire run: Taylor Swift. The Taylor's Version of 1989 fan favorite “Out of the Woods” was used during a climactic Paris scene in the episode, and saw a 184% gain to 961,000 streams over that five-day period after. And even more impressively, Swift's Reputation highlight “Dress” saw gains of 666% after being used in a dramatic finale makeout scene, rising to 436,000 to 3.4 total million streams over the same period. 


	And in case your hearts and/or Spotify playlists are hurting following the show's series finale, fret not: it was announced during the finale's red carpet celebration that The Summer I Turned Pretty would be returning for a franchise-concluding feature-length film, at a date to be determined. – AU

Since its inception way back in 2012 (truly a different time), the “V/H/S” horror anthology series has delivered a reliable selection of thrills and chills with only slightly truncated regularity (the first three films arrived in 2012, 2013, and 2014, before putting a pause on the whole caboodle, only to come roaring back in 2021 and banging out entry out a year). And while the series has often been released in the prime of spooky time (read: October), the eighth entry into the franchise is now going full Halloween.

Naturally, it's entitled “V/H/S/Halloween,” and the latest feature promises all sorts of holiday-appropriate tricks and treats. Per its official synopsis: “A collection of Halloween-themed videotapes unleashes a series of twisted, blood-soaked tales, turning trick-or-treat into a struggle for survival.”

Related Stories The 2025 — 2026 Film Awards Calendar Stretches Out the Season ‘Dead of Winter' Review: Emma Thompson Goes ‘Fargo' Mode in a Fun and Frigid Minnesotan Thriller 

The film just had its world premiere at Fantastic Fest over the weekend, and early reviews have been largely positive, hailing its combination of laugh-out-loud jokes and gory scares. Per usual, the anthology film is built on found-footage conceits, offering up five horror shorts and sixth that serves as both the frame for the entire endeavor and its own chilling entry. 

 










On offer this time around: stories about the evils of diet soda, suburban moms, crime scenes, Halloween candy, video stores, and even a cursed LP. In other words, it's got it all. 

The film's six segments include “Diet Phantasma” directed by Bryan M. Ferguson, “Fun Size” directed by Casper Kelly, “Home Haunt” directed by Micheline Pitt-Norman & R.H. Norman, “Kidprint” directed by Alex Ross Perry, “Ut Supra Sic Infra” directed by Paco Plaza, and “Coochie Coochie Coo” directed by Anna Zlokovic.

The full trailer for “V/H/S/Halloween” leans way into its perfectly calibrated scary setting, but for all the obviously dark stuff this new look shows off (dark spaces, bone-crunching sound effects, and what is clearly a super evil crime scene), it's the specific Halloween stuff that really pops. Haven't you ever thought how odd it is that we go to strangers' houses one night a year to ask them to give our children candy? Or that we pay money for people to jump out at us in confined spaces? Halloween, naturally scary, but also naturally really weird.

Check out the full trailer for “V/H/S/Halloween” below. It will start streaming on Shudder on Friday, October 3.

	On Wednesday (Sept. 24), the pop star announced on Instagram that Target will be carrying a store-exclusive version of her upcoming album. Dubbed The Life of a Showgirl: The Crowd Is Your King, the limited pressings will feature a “summertime spritz pink shimmer” disc along with a collectible sleeve, a “giant” double-sided poster, an exclusive poem penned by Swift and special photos, according to the description.


	“A showgirl knows to save some of her best tricks for the grand finale…,” Swift wrote in her post, sharing photos of the Target edition. “PS: we're [nine] days away(!!!!!!!!!!!!)”

	











	Available for purchase at $34.99, the Target exclusive will also feature its own custom cover art. The gold-toned image finds the artist looking down at the camera while draped in sparkly lingerie and feathers.

	The news follows a series of other Showgirl vinyls released by Swift, as well as a batch of Target-only Showgirl CDs containing exclusive double-sided posters. Featuring exclusive artwork, photographs and poetry, each vinyl variant became available for just 48 hours on the 14-time Grammy winner's website.


	In a recent Instagram video from Taylor Nation, Swift's official fan site, the musician explained why she wanted Showgirl to be available in so many different forms. “The photoshoot we did with Mert and Marcus was so extraordinary, and I was so happy with it, that I just wanted fans to have as many images from this world, this album era, as possible,” she said. “I really spent a lot of time figuring out how I could make the best vinyl product, the best packaging, the best CD experience that they could have … I hope the fans are happy.”


	Arriving Oct. 3, The Life of a Showgirl will mark Swift's first album since her 2024 17-week Billboard 200 chart-topper The Tortured Poets Department. The singer first announced the new LP on fiancé Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce's New Heights podcast, where she revealed that she'd made all 12 songs on the project with Max Martin and Shellback during her global Eras Tour.

	











	“I was so mentally stimulated and excited to be creating,” she said at the time. “[The album is] a lot more upbeat, and it's a lot more fun pop excitement. My main goals were melodies that were so infectious, you're almost angry at it.”


	“We've made songs that I'm so proud of,” she added at the time. “We've never actually made an album before where it was just the three of us, there's no other collaborators. It felt like catching lightning in a bottle. These guys, they're just geniuses. Working with them again was absolutely incredible.”

Cherien Dabis' historical drama about a Palestinian family expelled from Jaffa in 1948 bowed at Sundance and is set for a theatrical release and awards season contention.



		By Etan Vlessing, Chris Gardner 

	September 24, 2025 11:30am	




	Javier Bardem and Mark Ruffalo have boarded All That's Left of You, Jordan's selection for the best international feature Oscars category, as executive producers.


	Palestinian-American director Cherien Dabis' historical drama premiered at Sundance and tells a multigenerational story of a family expelled from Jaffa in 1948. When a Palestinian teenager gets swept up into a protest in the occupied West Bank and experiences a moment of violence that rocks his family, his mother recounts the political and emotional threads that led to that fateful moment.

	Spanning seven decades, the epic drama captures the hopes and heartaches of an uprooted family, revealing the scars of displacement and the unbreakable spirit of survival, according to a synopsis from the producers. “Cherien's beautiful, intelligent and deeply moving film All That's Left of You powerfully captures the true story of Palestine that has never been told before in a way that is both artistic and authentic,” Spanish actor Bardem said in a statement.

	Watermelon Pictures and Dabis' new production and distribution company Visibility Films will co-release All That's Left of You. A theatrical run in Los Angeles starting Nov. 28, 2025 is planned to position the movie for awards season play. That will be followed by a release in select cities on Jan. 9, 2026, before opening nationwide.

	











	“All That's Left Of You is an epic, deeply human film that spans decades, capturing the Palestinian Nakba with authenticity, compassion and grace. It reminds us that even in the face of unimaginable loss, our way forward lies in empathy, in finding meaning in grief and in choosing humanity over vengeance,” Ruffalo added in his own statement.


	Dabis' third feature also screened at Telluride after the conflict in Gaza forced principal production to shift from Palestine to Cyprus, Jordan and Greece. Dabis' two previous features, Amreeka (2009) and May in the Summer (2013), both debuted at Sundance. Amreeka went on to win the Fipresci international critics prize at Cannes.


	“I'm beyond thrilled to have two people I deeply admire, Javier Bardem and Mark Ruffalo, join us in amplifying the urgency and importance of this film,” Dabis said in her own statement. “All That's Left of You takes audiences back to 1948 — the origin of Palestinian displacement — and follows one family across nearly eight decades, shaped by political forces beyond their control. It is the untold story of how Palestinians first became refugees, and how that history led us to the present moment. To understand what's happening in Gaza today, we must first understand the history of how we arrived here,” she added.


	Besides writing and directing the film, Dabis stars alongside real-life father and sons Mohammad Bakri, Saleh Bakri and Adam Bakri. The producer credits are shared by Dabis, Thanassis Karathanos, Martin Hampel and Karim Amer. Bardem and Ruffalo executive produce alongside Geralyn Dreyfous.

EXCLUSIVE: With her time playing Eleven on the hit series Stranger Things coming to an end later this year, Millie Bobby Brown looks to have already found that next great character to play as sources tell Deadline the Emmy-nominee is in final negotiations to star as Olympian Kerri Strug in the pic Perfect. Gia Coppola is on board to direct and while a deal isn't closed, sources say Netflix is in negotiations to land the package.


	Ronnie Sandahl is writing with Brown producing under her PMCA banner. Lead producers are Nik Bower for Riverstone Pictures and Thomas Benski for Magna Studios.

	With the Strug story, Brown gets the opportunity to tackle not only one of the great Olympic stories of all time, but one of the great sport stories of its era. A member of the 1996 American gymnastics team dubbed “the Magnificent Seven,” Strug played a huge role in clinching the gold after performing the vault on a badly injured ankle. The image of her landing it perfectly and then having that ankle give out only to have her coach carry her off the mat is still considered one of the more memorable moments in Olympic history. Sources say the plan is to shoot the movie next spring.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Ever since her breakout role in the first season of Stranger Things, Brown has done a good job of picking her non-Stranger Things projects including her very successful Enola Holmes franchise with the third film expected to bow sometime soon. With this project, she gets her first big chance to sink her teeth into something that could play for the awards crowd similar to when Margot Robbie played Tonya Harding in I, Tonya.

	











	Next up for Brown is the final season of Stranger Things, which Netflix release over three volumes with the first set of episodes bowing over Thanksgiving weekend and the final episode bowing on New Years Eve. She also has Enola Holmes 3 and is about to start filming the Netflix pic Just Picture It opposite Gabriel LaBelle.


	Coppola feature directorial debut Palo Alto premiered at Telluride, Venice and Toronto Film Festivals before its 2014 Tribeca Film release. She directed and co-wrote, Mainstream, which premiered worldwide at the 2020 Venice Film Festival and played at the Telluride & Toronto Film Festivals. Her latest film, The Last Showgirl, stars Pamela Anderson, Jamie Lee Curits, and Dave Bautista, and garnered Anderson a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Drama Motion Picture.  


	Brown is repped by WME and PCMA Management and Productions and Coppola is repped by CAA and Untitled Entertainment

Romantic drama All Of You comes with a big sci-fi hook. In a near-future version of London, a glossy tech company has created a soulmate “test” that pairs each person who takes it with their perfect match—happiness scientifically guaranteed. It's a premise that seems right out of an episode of Black Mirror, but though All Of You indulges in some lightly futuristic touches, its tone is more earnestly retro than forward-looking. There are surface similarities to sci-fi romances like Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind and Timer, but at its heart All Of You is more like a cross between two pre-dating-app classics: When Harry Met Sally and Brief Encounter.

Subbing in for Harry is Brett Goldstein's Simon, a wry but caring journalist who's more in line with Goldstein's softer real-life persona than his grumpy Ted Lasso alter ego. Simon's “Sally” is his old university friend Laura (Imogen Poots), a flighty, sarcastic cool girl who shares his dark sense of humor. From the moment they first slip into a gentle hug, their connection is palpable. As they banter on the tube ride to Laura's test appointment, Simon jokes that this is going to ruin their friendship; no one keeps up with their college buddies once they've found their soulmate. For his part, he'd rather just find love organically than take the clinical approach. Or perhaps he just feels he's already found his perfect match. 

Scientifically, however, Laura's soulmate isn't Simon but Lukas (Steven Cree), a responsible Scotsman whose straightforwardness at least theoretically balances out Laura's sarcasm. The film casually, almost disorientingly hops forward in time as Laura and Lukas get more serious and Simon begins dating Laura's friend Andrea (Zawe Ashton). Yet even as the years pass, the chemistry between Laura and Simon never fades. If anything, the longing between them only grows as Simon provides a certain breezy escape from Laura's increasingly adult concerns.

As with this summer's Materialists, one can read All Of You as a commentary on modern dating app culture and the obsession with optimizing and gamifying our lives like we're algorithms to be perfected. But, also like Materialists, All Of You also deals with themes as timeless as love itself: the fear of ruining a friendship by making it romantic, the fear of ruining a romance by chasing the fantasy of something better, the fear of ruining your life by remaining stuck in indecision. As the film moves into weighty topics like marriage, babies, and parental death, the “soulmate” conceit becomes a bit of a cheat code to give the Lukas half of this love triangle equal weight, even as the film narrows its focus to just Simon and Laura. 

In that sense, All Of You lives and dies on the performances from Goldstein and Poots, who are essentially in a two-hander play for much of its runtime. Simon and Laura are the type of people more likely to crack a joke than to actually say what they mean—summed by a vignette where Simon rushes Laura to the hospital for a medical emergency she doesn't want to acknowledge. So it's a good thing that the two lead performers excel at giving their characters rich, complex inner lives that peek through their cheeky banter. There's a childish self-centeredness to Laura, who chases whatever makes her feel most comfortable in the moment; a husband for life's serious moments and a maybe-more-than-friend for the rest. And there's a quiet sadness to Simon, who would rather accept a half-life of happiness than let go of the woman he loves from afar. 

That Simon and Laura are at least somewhat self-aware of those flaws only adds to their bittersweet relationship. Director William Bridges (the “USS Callister” writer who, before co-writing this script with Goldstein, made the similarly-premised anthology series Soulmates with him) has a keen eye for the details of human behavior, both in the film's goofier rom-com moments and its more serious drama. While a few scenes veer a touch too far into repetitive melodrama, All Of You is elevated by the tremendous chemistry between two actors who are allowed to be a little thornier and less likable than your average romance leads.

That means All Of You doesn't just offer a will-they-won't-they for Simon and Laura, but serves up one for its audience too. It's hard to decide whether to root for them to be together or to let each other go; both choices seem impossible and necessary in equal measure. It's an appreciably adult dilemma for an appreciably adult drama. As with so many great onscreen romances, it's not that All Of You is doing something that's never been done before, just that it's doing it really well, with a great pair of actors at its center.

First Amendment experts says the long-running satirical band's over-the-top schtick is precisely what free speech protections are all about.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	For more than 40 years, the members of thrash metal costumed rock group GWAR have been schlepping their giant intergalactic monster costumes across the planet as part of a wildly over-the-top theatrical show featuring the beheading and/or comically absurd disemboweling of every president from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump.


	The band's fans gleefully push to the front of their gigs in order to get blasted with any manner of fake bodily fluids that erupt from the towering, cartoonish dummies. But over the weekend, some folks who apparently just discovered the band, allegedly got into a tizzy over one aspect of GWAR's current show — a mock beheading of Tesla CEO and former DOGE boss Elon Musk. The tweets appeared to be an attempt to gin up outrage over the formerly uncontroversial bit, at a time when Donald Trump and the chairman of the FCC have been sending ominous messages about their view of the limits on the First Amendment's right to free speech.

	











	“The idea that GWAR is normalizing violence is patently absurd,” lead singer Michael “Blöthar the Berserker” Bishop tells Billboard about a hair-on-fire headline from the New York Post tabloid earlier this week that read: “Heavy Metal Band Stage Phony Beheading of Elon Musk, Murder Trump in Shocking Festival Performance.”




	The show in question was the band's appearance at the Riot Fest in Chicago, which, as noted above, was in keeping with their performance style of the past four decades, during which they have taken their prop chainsaws and swords to public figures left, right, and center, including former Sec. of State Hillary Clinton, Justin Bieber and Pope Francis, as well as America's most recent non-Trump president, democrat Joe Biden.


	The Post piece was seemingly inspired by a tweet in which someone — credited as <a href=”https://<a href=”https://ubpass.co/billboard” target=”_blank” rel=”noopener noreferrer”>   <img     src=”https://i.imgur.com/2HpFicp.png”     alt=”Billboard VIP Pass”     style=”max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;”   /> @hottakekaren, which many suspected was a fake account — said the band's act was not “edgy, it's grotesque and reckless and normalizes violence against a real person. This is not okay.”


	Bishop was both annoyed and surprised by the alleged outrage, noting that the band have been at this for a long time — and that GWAR has always been, like punk rock in many ways, “chaotic and indecipherable” in its politics. “We're not millionaires that are afraid of what people are going to say when they see what we do,” he says, questioning if the tweets allegedly denigrating the band were posted by actual humans with a bone to pick or bots. “Yeah, it pissed me off! We're a group of artists that makes art, and it's really the idea that what we have done is normalizing violence… there's nothing normal about the violence that goes on at a GWAR show. It's a cartoon, it's Looney Tunes.”

	











	The fake blood-spurting bits are the way they are for a reason, he says: because the band doesn't want people to see what their doing and think of it as a realistic depiction of violence. “It's a parody of violence,” Bishop says of the seven-foot-tall Musk puppet in a DOGE shirt who got his prop head lopped off — in a costume the singer says is frequently switched out to represent whoever the band says it does based on the story they're telling on that album cycle. “It's trying to make violence into a spectacle and show humanity's absolute absurdity. That's what GWAR is, it's absurdism. To say it's normalizing violence is really reaching.”


	And while it's nothing new, the headline came in the midst of the national debate over ABC pulling Jimmy Kimmel off the air last week, after the late night host made a joke related to the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The joke resulted in Nexstar, which owns more than two dozen ABC-affiliated stations, saying they were going to yank Kimmel's show indefinitely. A day after the monologue, FCC chair Brendan Carr appeared on YouTuber Benny Johnson's show and appeared to make a threat to revoke ABC affiliate licenses over Kimmel's comments.


	“What people don't understand is that the broadcasters … have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest,” said Carr. “When we see stuff like this, look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.” The comments from Carr were interpreted by many as a threat to chill free speech, or, as similar conduct featuring informal government pressure to influence private action is referred to: “jawboning.”

	











	“The First Amendment protects expression in the form of music,” Kevin Goldberg, vice president and First Amendment expert at the non-partisan First Amendment education organization Freedom Forum tells Billboard. “What you're seeing and what you're hearing [from GWAR] is fully protected by the First Amendment, as is the right to engage in parody and satire as part of that performance.”


	At at time when Trump — who has been the target of multiple assassination attempts — has complained that “97%” of what the media says about him is negative, Goldberg says that while GWAR's act is protected speech, there are two unprotected areas that are not covered by the First Amendment that have been bandied about over the past two weeks. He says both of them are currently being widely misinterpreted.


	While the unprotected area of speech is “much narrower” than you might think based on the current conversations in the public sphere, Goldberg says one of them, “true threat,” requires the person using that speech to intend or know that their speech is going to make someone fear for their safety. “That's a very specific type of threat, and parody and satire is so rhetorical and over-the-top that it can't be taken plausibly by the subject to be an actual threat,” he says.


	The same is true for the other unprotected area, “incitement to imminent lawless violence” — which, he says, by its very name requires an intent to have people go and immediately carry out some kind of lawless act. “That's not what's happening here. That's not what they want people to do,” Goldberg says of GWAR. “They want people to understand that they're making a political statement and that's why we have this broad protection for speech that may even seem like it incites violence because we want to protect political speech. And that's what I would say this is, political speech.”

	











	Yes, it it unconventional and perhaps startling speech, but that's the point. Though, Goldberg adds, that “everything is contextual at all times,” meaning that a gesture that might have been laughed off as pure, fantastical parody might feel a bit different during a time when actual, deadly, political violence has shaken both democrats and republicans over the past few years. 


	“GWAR needs to understand that in this moment in time suggesting the beheading of the president or Elon Musk could be taken more seriously by some members of the public who have no idea of their intent based on past history,” says Goldberg. “Their [GWAR's] understanding is, ‘We've always done it this way — but now you're paying attention.'”


	Regardless, Goldberg adamantly reiterated that, of course, what GWAR is doing is “completely” protected by the First Amendment, even if it is an “extreme version” of political speech. Not for nothing, Goldberg notes that back in the 1985, it was democrats — led by Parents Music Resource Center co-founder Tipper Gore — who formed a bipartisan U.S. government committee aimed at policing children's access to music that they deemed to have sexual, violent or drug-related content. 


	“The threat of censorship has always lingered over the music industry from both sides of the political aisle,” says Goldberg. 


	GWAR singer Bishop says he's “absolutely” worried that the nation's bedrock free speech rights are imperiled at the moment. In a Truth Social rant posted just before Kimmel's return on Tuesday night (Sept. 23), Trump — who the comedian noted in his emotional monologue, said in 2022, “if we don't have free speech, then we just don't have a free country” — took another ominous shot at the show and parent company ABC.

	











	“He [Kimmel] is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do,” Trump wrote in a comment that some media pundits took as a threat of further legal action against the Disney-owned network. (ABC News settled a $16 million defamation lawsuit filed by Trump last year over remarks from anchor George Stephanopoulos inaccurately claiming that the president had been found civily liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll.)


	While Bishop doesn't see anything funny about what he feels is a clear and present danger to free speech right now, the organizers of Riot Fest took a very different tack when responding to the alleged outrage over the set. 


	“Like I know this is a rage bait engagement farming twitter account, but “GWAR crossed a major line” is one of the funniest f–king things I've ever heard,” read one mocking tweet among many from the fest, with another adding, “The dumbest people on the internet are still mad today. Got to love it. As long as they keep posting that awesome video and mentioning our name for the free publicity it's a win for me.”

And he almost “sent an email” to attendees ahead of time explaining what he hoped it would accomplish. That probably would have been a good idea.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



Nate Bargatze proved to be a charitable, generous man at the 77th Emmy Awards — not that he especially planned to be.


	The standup comic said on his Nateland podcast he never planned on donating $250,000 of his own money to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, as he did at the end of the Emmys.




	“I had it in my head one way. It kind of came out another way, but — the reasoning was there,” Bargatze said of the running gag. “I wasn't gonna give that money at the end, like, I wasn't thinking I was gonna have to. But the way it went, I was like, ‘I can't— I'm not gonna not…'”

	The bit went like this: Bargatze, while opening the live awards show, pledged $100,000 of his own money to the Boys & Girls Clubs. Awesome. Even awesome-r, for every tick under 45 seconds a winner's acceptance speech lasted, Bargatze would add another $1,000 from his own pocket. However, for every second over 45 seconds a winner went, he'd deduct $1,000 from the running tally. The bank ended up quite a bit in the red.




			Related Video		







	Bargatze says CBS had specifically asked him to come up with a way to keep acceptance speeches tight. CBS “loved” what he came up with, Bargatze said, as did “everyone at home.”


	You know who didn't? “A lot of the reviews,” Bargatze acknowledged.


Shameless plug here for me being among the few in the media to defend the bit. (That said, it sounds like I was wrong about Bargatze preplanning to cover the overages personally. Whether he wanted to or had to, in the end, he did the right thing.)

	











	Bargatze saw this thing going a whole ‘nother way.


	“I thought it was gonna be, I dunno, Netflix donating, or Apple,” Bargatze said on Nateland's 271st episode. “If someone was giving these long speeches, I just thought they could be like, ‘and Netflix is gonna cover my overage.'”


	“In my head, I pictured they could then go long, but then be a hero,” he said. “But I think I could have explained it more, to be honest.”


	And he almost did. Bargatze said he “almost sent an email out” ahead of the show to explain the game and what he hoped to accomplish with it. A good idea, in hindsight.

Jessica Chastain expressed her disappointment with Apple's decision to postpone the release of her upcoming limited series The Savant — about an undercover investigator who goes after online extremist groups — in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination.


AppleTV+ announced its decision to hold the show on Tuesday, Sept. 23, three days before its scheduled Sept. 26 premiere. A spokesperson said, “After careful consideration, we have made the decision to postpone The Savant. We appreciate your understanding and look forward to releasing the series at a future date” (via The Hollywood Reporter).


	In a statement shared on social media the following day, Chastain wrote, “I want to say how much I value my partnership with Apple. They've been incredible collaborators and I deeply respect their team. That said, I wanted to reach out and let you know that we're not aligned on the decision to pause the release of The Savant.” 


	While AppleTV+ did not mention Kirk or cite any specific reasons behind its decision, it's widely believed that it stemmed from concerns over the show's content in relation to recent events. Based on descriptions of the series, there are no plot lines or characters that directly parallel Kirk or his death, but the show does contend with online extremism and political violence. 

	











	But as Chastain seemed to suggest in her statement, Kirk's death isn't necessarily an isolated act of political violence. “In the last five years since we've been making the show, we've seen an unfortunate amount of violence in the United States,” Chastain wrote, going on to mention everything from the attempted kidnapping of Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and January 6, to the Trump assassination attempt, as well as the assassinations of Kirk and two Democratic representatives in Minnesota. 

	











	“These incidents, though far from encompassing the full range of violence witnessed in the United States, illustrate a broader mindset that crosses the political spectrum and must be confronted,” Chastain wrote. “I've never shied away from difficult subjects, and while I wish this show wasn't so relevant, unfortunately it is.”

	She ended her statement by saying, “The Savant is about the heroes who work every day to stop violence before it happens, and honoring their courage feels more urgent than ever. While I respect Apple's decision to pause the release for now, I remain hopeful the show will reach audiences soon. Until then, I'm wishing safety and strength for everyone, and I'll let you know if and when The Savant is released.”


	A new release date for The Savant hasn't been shared yet. A page for the show on the streamer lists it as “Coming at a later date.”

Jimmy Kimmel made his return to late-night on Tuesday, a week after Disney and ABC made the call to pull Jimmy Kimmel Live! from the air, citing the host's comments about the right-wing response to Charlie Kirk's death. Media companies Sinclair and Nexstar are continuing to preempt the series. Still, while it didn't air on their ABC-affiliate channels last night, Kimmel's 30-minute monologue has racked up nearly 12 million views in the past 12 hours on YouTube.


	The views are continuing to climb, setting the video on track to be the most-viewed upload from Jimmy Kimmel Live! since the host sat down with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and 50 Cent last year. That clip sits at 16 million views.


	“Maybe most of all, I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” Kimmel said in his emotional monologue. “People I never would have imagined, like Ben Shapiro, Clay Travis, Candace Owens, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul. Even my old pal Ted Cruz.… Even though I don't agree with many of those people on most subjects — some of the things they say even make me want to throw up — it takes courage for them to speak out against this administration, and they did, and they deserve credit for it.”

	











	This throws a wrench into the Trump administration's plans. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr claimed that Kimmel attempted to push the narrative that Kirk's shooter “was somehow a MAGA or Republican-motivated person,” again calling it “sick,” in an effort to have the show pulled.

	Donald Trump himself threw something of a fit about Kimmel's return. In a rant on Truth Social, he declaring that he intends to sue ABC for bringing the show back. “I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back,” Trump wrote. “The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‘talent' was never there.”

	Trump is referencing the settlement in which Paramount agreed to pay $16 million in donations to the future Trump Library after he filed a lawsuit against 60 Minutes, objecting to an interview with Kamala Harris that was not edited to his liking. Around the same time, Paramount was vying for federal approval of an $8 billion merger with Skydance, which had been in limbo for some time.


	When Stephen Colbert referred to the deal as a “big fat bribe,” Paramount suddenly announced it was ending The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, despite the show's top-ranking ratings. Maybe Trump assumed the same would happen to Kimmel. However, if more than 11 million people are willing to tune in online as well, his fight can't be with the networks. Is he going to sue YouTube next? That would make for a great Jimmy Kimmel Live! segment.

Jimmy Kimmel made his return to late-night on Tuesday, a week after Disney and ABC made the call to pull Jimmy Kimmel Live! from the air, citing the host's comments about the right-wing response to Charlie Kirk's death. Media companies Sinclair and Nexstar are continuing to preempt the series. Still, while it didn't air on their ABC-affiliate channels last night, Kimmel's 30-minute monologue has racked up more than 16 million views in the past 12 hours on YouTube.


	The views are continuing to climb, officially making the video his most-viewed YouTube upload from Jimmy Kimmel Live! since the host sat down with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and 50 Cent last year. That clip also had 16 million views.


	“Maybe most of all, I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” Kimmel said in his emotional monologue. “People I never would have imagined, like Ben Shapiro, Clay Travis, Candace Owens, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul. Even my old pal Ted Cruz.… Even though I don't agree with many of those people on most subjects — some of the things they say even make me want to throw up — it takes courage for them to speak out against this administration, and they did, and they deserve credit for it.”

	











	This throws a wrench into the Trump administration's plans. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr claimed that Kimmel attempted to push the narrative that Kirk's shooter “was somehow a MAGA or Republican-motivated person,” again calling it “sick,” in an effort to have the show pulled.

	Donald Trump himself threw something of a fit about Kimmel's return. In a rant on Truth Social, he declaring that he intends to sue ABC for bringing the show back. “I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back,” Trump wrote. “The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‘talent' was never there.”

A 66-year-old two-time Oscar winner who's still near the height of her powers and has presumably made enough money for her grandkids to retire at birth, Emma Thompson could spend the rest of her life guest-starring on British TV shows and sleeping in her own bed at night and no one would think any less of her. But actors have to act (we love them for that, and that for them), and even a screen icon of Thompson's cachet is powerless to pass up the prospect of saying dialogue like “Freakin' fiddlesticks shitBUNS!” in a Marge Gunderson-thick Brainerd accent.

 










So while the rest of us might have been happy to stay warm at home, Thompson hoofed it out to the snowy wilds of Finland in order to film “Dead of Winter,” a programmatic but tightly plotted thriller — set amidst a brutal Minnesota blizzard — in which she plays a widowed ice fisher who asks the wrong guy for directions on the way to a certain lake (he's not quite in the middle of feeding a human body into a wood chipper, but he might as well be). Hardly a scene goes by where Thompson isn't beaten, chased, and/or shot at in sub-zero temperatures, but you get the sense that all of the frostbite in the world couldn't have stopped her from getting her own little taste of “Fargo.”

That passion — that enduring sense of purpose — is reflected across the course of a small but satisfying movie about people who are either desperate for something to live for, or living only for their desperation. If only they could find a way forward for themselves. Barb Sorenson (Thompson) is looking for precisely that when she heads out into the cold for a day on the ice. All “Minnesota nice” and quiet sorrow, she planned to start her search at a fishing spot that was especially meaningful to her late husband; the only problem is that she can't find it. 

So she asks Camo Jacket — as Marc Menchaca's oafishly menacing character is identified in the credits — to point her in the right direction, even though he doesn't seem like the most trustworthy fella. Minutes later, after Barb's truck breaks down, she watches Camo Jacket hunt down and hand-tie a young woman (Laurel Madsen) who escaped from his house. In lieu of anything else to do with herself, Barb decides to intervene. But sneaking into Camo Jacket's basement and stealing the girl won't be easy, because Camo Jacket is married to Purple Lady (played by a rifle-toting Judy Greer, a fentanyl lollipop always lodged in her mouth), and she isn't quite as helpless as her husband. 

 










Directing from a lean and functional script by Nicholas Jacobson-Larson and Dalton Leeb, Brian Kirk (“21 Bridges”) maneuvers these four characters around each other with care and a clear eye for tension. The action is taut, the stakes are clear, and Kirk never misses a chance to remind us that all of these are just regular people who've crossed paths in a dark place. These are humble Americans more accustomed to baiting fish than shooting humans, and while that may not excuse all of the thriller cliches this movie indulges when push comes to shove during its do-or-die third act (i.e. someone running out of ammo right when they've lined up a certain kill shot), every Coen brothers-esque blunder reinforces the idea that these characters have been forcibly diverted from the lives they were meant to live.

To that end, the movie's greatest conflict might be that between their folksy earnestness and their flinty desperation, and it's a conflict that every member of the cast is able to articulate within themselves without resorting to caricature. The mystery as to why Purple Lady and Camo Jacket have kidnapped a suicidal woman is too opaque at first (something to do with organ harvesting, it seems?), and then too impractical by the end (she's getting a doctor to do what?), but Greer always shines as a self-interested villain, and she manages to sell the absolute shit out of an unscrupulous woman who's doing what she has to in order to survive. You may not believe in the full scope of her character's circumstances, but not for a second will you doubt the wincing sincerity of her “sorry, not sorry” attitude toward saving her own skin. 

 










Greer's Purple Jacket makes a terrific foil for Thompson's Barb, whose “aw shucks” affect is pointed towards risking her life for a perfect stranger. Recurring flashbacks — in which a younger Barb is embodied by Thompson's own daughter Gaia Wise — do more to disrupt the film's suspense than to meaningfully complicate its protagonist, but the most impactful of these glimpses into her marriage offer some insight into the various roles she hoped to play over the course of her life (wife, mother, entrepreneur, etc.), and hint at the difficulties that have come from being recast against her will. 

If Thompson exudes too much tenacity for us to need such labored glimpses into her character's past, the extra insight makes it that much easier to buy her character's transformation into a badass good Samaritan, and “Dead of Winter” never loses sight of what its backwoods shenanigans mean to Barb on a deeper level. People will do anything to survive, but a life without purpose can be worse than death; watching Emma Thompson bleed, shiver, and shoot her way through a movie this cold is proof enough of that.

Vertical Entertainment will release “Dead of Winter” in theaters on Friday, September 26.

Amazon MGM Studios‘ adaptation of Rebecca Yarros' bestselling novel Fourth Wing is closing in on a new showrunner. Wednesday Season 2 executive producer Meredith Averill is in final negotiations to board the project as writer and executive producer, sources tell Deadline.


	She would succeed Moira Walley-Beckett who left in June, a year after she was tapped to pen the adaptation. WandaVision creator Jac Schaeffer was among a number of top writers who met on the project.


	The Fourth Wing TV series comes from Michael B. Jordan's Outlier Society, Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy's Kilter Films and Premediated Productions.

	Planned as a five-book series, with Fourth Wing (2023), Iron Flame (2023) and Onyx Storm (2025) as the first three titles, The Empyrean follows twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail as she leaves the life of a Scribe behind at her mother's demand that she become a dragon rider. At the order of her mother, who is a General in the military of Navarre, Violet enters the brutal ranks of Basgiath War College, which trains up-and-coming riders through the Graduate or Die method.


Fourth Wing has spent 88 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, 18 of them at #1.


	Averill was co-developer, executive producer and co-showrunner on Netflix's Locke & Key, based on the comic books. She was creator/executive producer on the CW's Star-Crossed and also executive produced Netflix's The Haunting of Hill House.

The comic's Mister Whatever tour takes him to his hometown in 2026.


							By 

	Mikey O'Connell


TV Features Editor


John Mulaney is going big with his current tour, following a string of sold-out dates with a marquee performance in his hometown next year. The stand-up is set to play Chicago's Wrigley Field, marking the first time a comic has ever headlined the historic ballpark.


	The Everybody's Live host announced the news on Tuesday night during — what else? — a Chicago Cubs game. Before the Cubs lost to the New York Mets, Mulaney sang “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” to the crowd and then took a seat in the broadcast booth to share the news — noting the venue's daunting capacity.

	











	“Look, if Mark Grace could come out there every day and just deliver ripping cigarettes, I can face down this crowd too,” offered Mulaney.

	Tickets are not yet on sale for the July 11, 2026, performance but it is expected to draw a crowd of tens of thousands. (During baseball games, Wrigley regularly fits north of 40,000.)


	Mulaney began touring Mister Whatever earlier in 2025, and the last three months of the year are packed with dates throughout the U.S. A taped special of his new set has yet to be announced, but it's only a matter of time.And for those more interested in Mulaney's musical stylings, the MLB graciously posted the below clip of his seventh inning stretch serenade.

A woman claims Metro sexually assaulted her in 2016, while the producer calls the case a "shakedown" she concocted while high on ayahuasca.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



The trial has just begun in a rape lawsuit against Metro Boomin – but attorneys for the superstar producer's alleged victim are asking for a mistrial, saying a defense lawyer made improper claims about her sexual history during opening arguments.


	A jury in Los Angeles federal court heard opening arguments on Tuesday (Sept. 23) for the civil case brought by Vanessa LeMaistre, who alleges she blacked out after ingesting Xanax and alcohol in Metro Boomin's studio during a 2016 recording session and later woke up to the producer (Leland Wayne) raping her.


	Metro denies the claims, saying the case is a “classic celebrity shakedown” that LeMaistre concocted while hallucinating on ayahuasca. He has always maintained that their 2016 sexual encounter was consensual – but lawyers for LeMaistre say Metro's team went too far during opening statements on Tuesday by arguing that the two had also had consensual sex before that night at the recording studio.


	In all sexual violence trials, there are strict rules that limit the defense from alluding to an alleged victim's sexual history or apparent proclivities. Typically, a defendant needs to ask permission from the judge before bringing up any sexual conduct that is not tied to the specific incident at issue in a trial.


	LeMaistre's attorneys – led by Michael Willemin of the powerhouse plaintiff's firm Wigdor – say in a mistrial motion filed late on Tuesday that Metro's lawyers did not properly seek judicial approval before making these statements about their prior sexual history (which LeMaistre denies).


	“If plaintiff's counsel was provided fair warning and a [hearing] was held, the claim that plaintiff engaged in consensual sex with the defendant prior to the sexual assault would have been precluded,” Willemin writes. “And, even if the court made the determination that the claim of consensual sex pre-dating the sexual assault was far more probative than prejudicial, plaintiff would have known such information was going to be permitted and would certainly have addressed it in plaintiff's opening statement.”


	Willemin says there's “no possible way to undo” the prejudice that Metro's opening caused, since jurors cannot unhear this statement. He's asking Judge R. Gary Klausner to declare a mistrial and start the whole case over again.


	Judge Klausner will likely address this issue before the trial is set to resume on Wednesday (Sept. 24). Metro's lawyers from the firm Sanders Roberts did not immediately return a request for comment on the matter.


	LeMaistre sued Metro in 2024, claiming she met the producer in Las Vegas in the spring of 2016. LeMaistre says she confided in Metro about the recent death of her 9-month-old son, and that they “bonded over the ability of music to help people in their darkest moments.”


	But LeMaistre's belief about her bond with Metro allegedly “shattered” the following September, when the producer invited her to watch him work in his California recording studio. LeMaistre says she had a shot of alcohol and half a tablet of Xanax, then blacked out, waking up on a bed in a different location “completely unable to move or make a sound” while Metro raped her.


	LeMaistre alleges she became pregnant as a result of the assault and had an abortion in November 2016. Notably, the lawsuit claims the attack is referenced in Metro's 2017 song “Rap Saved Me” with Offset, 21 Savage and Quavo.


	The lyrics in question, rapped by 21 Savage and Offset in the chorus, are: “She took a Xanny, then she fainted/ I'm from the gutter, ain't no changing/ From the gutter, rap saved me/ She drive me crazy, have my baby.”


	The lyrical reference in LeMaistre's lawsuit is surprising, since Metro is a music producer and songwriter but does not typically write lyrics or rap himself. Metro has denied writing the “Rap Saved Me” lyrics, as well as the rest of LeMaistre's allegations.


	Metro's position is that LeMaistre has transformed a consensual sexual encounter into a false tale of rape in order to squeeze money out of him. He's focused heavily on LeMaistre journal entries from when she was high on ayahuasca in 2024, in which she detailed a “plan” to sue Metro for more than $3 million.


	The issue of ayahuasca took center stage when LeMaistre testified in court on Tuesday following opening statements. According to a report by independent journalist Meghann Cuniff, LeMaistre insisted from the witness stand that she did not hallucinate on the drug. Rather, said LeMaistre, the ayahuasca merely helped her come to terms with the fact that her nonconsensual sex with Metro had been rape.


	Metro himself is due to testify during the trial, which is slated to last four days total.

UPDATE 9/24: “The Savant” star Jessica Chastain in an Instagram statement made clear that she is “not aligned” with Apple on the studio's decision to delay the show, though she respects their decision to do so and admires their partnership. She explains that “I've never shied away from difficult subjects, and while I wish this show wasn't so relevant, unfortunately it is.” 

Chastain's full statement reads: “I want to say how much I value my partnership with Apple. They've been incredible collaborators and I deeply respect their team. That said, I wanted to reach out and let you know that we're not aligned on the decision to pause the release of ‘The Savant.' In the last five years since we've been making the show, we've seen an unfortunate amount of violence in the United States: the kidnapping attempt on Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer; the January 6th attack on the Capitol; the assassination attempts on President Trump; the political assassinations of Democratic representatives in Minnesota; the attack on Speaker Pelosi's husband; the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk; the recent shooting at an ABC affiliate station in California; and over 300 school shootings across this country. These incidents, though far from encompassing the full range of violence witnessed in the United States, illustrate a broader mindset that crosses the political spectrum and must be confronted. I've never shied away from difficult subjects, and while I wish this show wasn't so relevant, unfortunately it is. ‘The Savant' is about the heroes who work every day to stop violence before it happens, and honoring their courage feels more urgent than ever. While I respect Apple's decision to pause the release for now, I remain hopeful the show will reach audiences soon. Until then, I'm wishing safety and strength for everyone, and I'll let you know if and when ‘The Savant' is released.

Original story follows: The anxiety around the political and cultural reaction to the killing of Charlie Kirk is so high that we could see more media companies on edge about how audiences react to their content. “The Savant,” a limited series starring Jessica Chastain originally set to premiere this Friday on Apple TV+, will be postponed, a rep for Apple TV+ told IndieWire.

 










While no specific reason was given, nor was any new release date announced, it's believed that current events contributed to the delay.

“After careful consideration, we have made the decision to postpone ‘The Savant.' We appreciate your understanding and look forward to releasing the series at a future date,” Apple TV+ said in a statement. 

“The Savant” stars Chastain as a woman who infiltrates online extremist groups in an attempt to discover mass shootings and extremist acts of terrorism before they happen. The series was created by Melissa James Gibson and was inspired by a 2019 article in Cosmopolitan, “Is It Possible to Stop a Mass Shooting Before It Happens?” 

The first trailer for the series, which you can watch below, shows her engaging online with extremists, attempting to think like them and expose their actions before reporting them to the authorities. It shows a series of “snipers, bombings, ambushes” — with Chastain specifically trying to bring down someone who wants to make an imprint on history with the type of event people refer to “with a month and a date.” It's also a show that grapples with Chastain's moral dilemma of wondering if it's right to be engaging with such people, even if it's in the name of a greater good.

“The Savant” would not be the first time a show or an episode was delayed in order to provide some breathing room from real-life tragedies. But the fervor over “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” being pre-empted last week (it comes back on air tonight) is likely just the first example of media companies in this very moment looking closely at what's being said and represented on their screens as showrunners reach for the headlines with politically relevant commentary and entertainment.

The new case comes after the star was acquitted on criminal sex-trafficking charges and just weeks before he's sentenced on lesser prostitution convictions.

	Bill Donahue



Sean “Diddy” Combs is facing a new civil abuse lawsuit from his longtime stylist Deonte Nash, months after the ex-employee testified against the hip hop mogul at his criminal trial.


	In a case submitted Wednesday in a Los Angeles court, Deonte Nash accuses Combs of assault, sexual battery and other wrongdoing – the latest of dozens of such lawsuits filed against Diddy since abuse claims first surfaced in 2023.


	The case from Nash, who also served as a stylist to Combs' longtime girlfriend and alleged abuse victim Cassie Ventura, comes after he testified at the star's blockbuster criminal trial in May, and less than two weeks before the star will be sentenced for his convictions on prostitution charges.


	“Though defendants have silenced him for years, Mr. Nash is no longer willing to give in to this fear for his life and is now standing up to demand justice,” his lawyers write in the court filings.




			Trending on Billboard		







	In his lengthy complaint, Nash says Combs turned his dream of working as a celebrity stylist “into a nightmare that he was forced to endure nearly every single day” for the ten years he worked for the star from 2008 to 2018.


	“Combs … subjected Mr. Nash to a decade of sexual and physical assault, sexual and verbal harassment, trafficking, degradation and humiliation, threats to his life and well-being, stalking, control, and psychological manipulation,” his lawyers write. “Combs used his power and threats of harm to compel Mr. Nash to do his bidding and prevent him from leaving defendants' control.”


	At a party in “2013 or 2014,” Nash says the star exposed his penis and moved closer to him until the stylist told him to stop. During another alleged incident in 2016, Nash says Diddy grabbed his hand and forced him to touch his penis. In yet another incident in 2018, he says the star “grinded” on his genitals in a “sexually-charged” way: “Mr. Nash felt violated and offended by this unwanted sexual touching.”


	The lawsuit also claims Diddy subjected Nash to physical violence, as well as “unreasonable demands and expectations” as his stylist. He says he eventually had “no other choice” but to resign in 2018, but that Combs then “continued to threaten Mr. Nash after his employment ended.”


	In a statement to Billboard on Wednesday, Diddy's attorney Erica Wolff called Nash “another opportunist looking to profit off his proximity to celebrity” who had filed a lawsuit that was “riddled with falsehoods.”


	“Mr. Nash's tabloid-style accusations are insulting not only to Mr. Combs but also to the countless individuals who worked honorably and professionally within his companies,” Wolff said. “In court, the truth will prevail, as it did in his criminal trial: that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone—adult or minor, man or woman. Mr. Combs looks forward to clearing his name again in a court of law where truth matters.”


	Combs was arrested and charged in September 2024 with racketeering (RICO) and sex trafficking violations over accusations that he ran a sprawling criminal operation aimed at facilitating freak-offs — elaborate events in which he allegedly forced Ventura and other women to have sex with male escorts while he watched and masturbated.


	At his blockbuster trial this spring, Nash took the witness stand for the prosecution, telling jurors he had seen Diddy physically abuse Ventura and threaten to release sex tapes of her if she didn't do what he demanded.


	But when the verdict was handed down, jurors largely cleared Combs, acquitting him on the core RICO and sex trafficking charges that could have seen him sentenced to prison for life. He was convicted only on two lesser counts of transporting Ventura and others across state lines for prostitution.


	Combs is set for sentencing on those convictions on Oct. 3. His lawyers asked the judge Monday to sentence him to 14 months in prison — a sentence that would see him released almost immediately on time served.


	But even if he's released quickly, Diddy is facing dozens of cases like Nash's, accusing him of rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment and various other forms of sexual abuse. Several have been dismissed in recent months, including one case filed by Making the Band 2 contestant Sara Rivers and another case by a John Doe plaintiff, but many others remain pending.

Columnist/International Editor At Large


EXCLUSIVE: Denis Villeneuve will embark on the search for an actor to play the world's most famous fictional spy, James Bond, next year when he completes production on Dune: Part Three. Those familiar with the matter tell us that the director and his collaborators are seeking a “fresh face” to take on the 007 mantle in Bond 26.


	Also, Bond … James Bond will be male, as written by creator Ian Fleming, and importantly, will be an actor who hails from the British isles. 


	Yes, they want a Brit to play Bond.


	That rules out fanciful speculation that the likes of Timothée Chalamet, Glen Powell, Austin Butler, Jacob Elordi and others who don't hail from UK shores are in the running.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Frankly, 99.9% of the names we've heard speculated online so far won't make the cut.


	Those in the know tell us the ideal approach is to cast “an unknown,” possibly in his late 20s or early 30s, to play what Fleming called “a blunt instrument” — the lethal but “extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened.”


	If that criteria is stuck to, that means favourites such as Tom Hardy, aged 47, Idris Elba at 53 and Henry Cavill, aged 42, presumably don't match what Villeneuve, producers David Heyman and Amy Pascal, and execs at Amazon MGM Studios are leaning towards.


	Also, consider that by the time Bond 26 begins shooting in 2027, both Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Jack Lowden will be 37 years of age. Will they be too old for Villeneuve?


	How rugged and imposing will this Bond be? Fleming describes Bond as being over 6 foot tall, even taller in his best Jermyn Street brogues. Daniel Craig is shorter than that.


	But have a think about Steven Knight's writing credits, a key source suggests, referring to the screenwriter picked to write the script for the Amazon MGM Studios production. 


	Knight's work includes SAS Rogue Heroes, Peaky Blinders and Eastern Promises, all of them featuring kick-ass, bone-crunching scenes. “Whoever it is, has to look like he could kill you with his bare hands in a trice. From the moment you see him, that has to be readily apparent,” a person close to discussions tells us.

	











	Online speculators and betting companies throw out names without thinking who Bond is. Knight will be going back to Fleming's earliest novels — Casino Royale (1953), Live and Let Die (1954), Moonraker (1955), Diamonds Are Forever (1956), From Russia, with Love (1957), Doctor No (1958) and Goldfinger (1959) — to help remind us who Fleming's protagonist is. Might the new Bond be more in the mould of a younger Sean Connery who originated 007 in 1962's Dr. No?


	There's a sense from the many conversations I've had that Knight's going back to Bond's beginnings as a Royal Navy Commander before being recruited by MI6, the UK's foreign intelligence agency, to perhaps chart how Bond attained 007 status. I want to stress that this is what I'm hearing but to caution that none of this is confirmed or fully formed because the script is still being written and the direction of travel is still up for grabs.


	Could Bond be played by a non Caucasian, I asked sources? He could, came the reply. As always, well, nearly always, it'll come down to this: Are they right for Bond? Are they right for the story that Villeneuve and screenwriter Knight will be telling?


	While we're here, it's worth pointing out the obvious: Bond 26 will not take up where No Time to Die, the final iteration in the franchise under Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, left us; with Bond dead. “It's a new Bond, a new start, a fresh everything,” is how it was put to me by a key source who adds that it's unlikely many associated with the past Bond regime will be involved with Bond 26. That said, I suspect a few old Bond hands might well be consulted on the quiet in the snug of a private club in Pall Mall, London.


	An unprecedented number of applicants have already sent in their pitch to play James Bond to the production. “Every name you've heard of, and many you've never heard of,” a well-placed mole revealed. “We've been flooded. But understand that the casting process has not begun and it won't until Denis finishes the Dune movie,” they continued.


	It pays to remember that  Craig, who, although famous to those of us who followed his career on stage and in independent and Hollywood movies, was not a household name when he was picked to play Fleming's approved British government assassin. I know that Broccoli knew of Craig's theater history but it wasn't until she saw Matthew Vaughn's Layer Cake that she became convinced he should be cast for Casino Royale. 


	British actors in their mid 20s to early 30s, with stellar acting chops, who fit the Bond mould, are going to be under an intense spotlight for the next 12 months. Bond … James Bond is somewhere out there.


	Our sources indicate that the film will be released in 2028 with filming due to take place in 2027. There's a lot of talk about the movie premiering in the November slot favored by past Bond movies.


	By the way, just because Bond will be British, it doesn't mean that other roles, such as the Bond foe and the actress leads, can't be performed by non-Brits, as has been the case for eons.

I say he should bring back one person from the previous regime: Daniel Kleinman to do the opening titles.

Andrew Koji please

Given the lead time on this, even if they cast a young-ish guy, he'll probably age out before the picture is released.

Tom Austen… Your time has come.

The wise thing will be to go back to Flemings original vision and build from there, give us the true bond ignore the parody's and  misinterpretations.

What can't Harris Dickinson do? He's an actor, a Beatle, a babygirl, a writer/director, and now a film curator.

His feature directing debut, “Urchin,” opens from 1-2 Special in New York and Los Angeles on October 10 before expanding nationwide on October 17. Ahead of the IndieWire-raved film starring Frank Dillane as a self-destructive London drifter, the Roxy Cinema in downtown Manhattan will host Harris Dickinson Selects. Dickinson himself curated the film series to invite audiences “inside the visual and emotional landscape that helped shape his first feature film,” per the Roxy. IndieWire shares more exclusive details below.

“Harris Dickinson has quietly built a reputation as one of the most nuanced actors of his generation.,” Roxy also wrote of the breakout “Triangle of Sadness” and “Beach Rats” actor. “With ‘Urchin,' Dickinson steps behind the camera, proving he's just as compelling a storyteller as he is a performer. The film follows a [young man] navigating life on the fringes of society in coastal Britain, balancing harsh realism with poetic introspection. It's a deeply personal work — one that feels both intimate and cinematically ambitious.”

From IndieWire's review of “Urchin”: “Dickinson's lithe and tetchy script only feigns at a clean hero's journey in order to undercut it with the chaos of human behavior, and what might have been a nice three-act story about a moppet on the mend sours into something far less digestible or instructive.”

The series includes films by Agnès Varda, Andrei Tarkovsky, and more. More details below.

“Vagabond” (dir. Agnès Varda)

A portrait of a young woman's solitary journey through rural France, told with Varda's trademark blend of realism and lyricism. Screening Wednesday, September 24 in 35mm.

“Nil by Mouth” (dir. Gary Oldman)

A raw, wrenching look at addiction and violence in South London—gritty, unflinching, and deeply compassionate. Screening Thursday, September 25 in 35mm.

“Andrei Rublev” (dir. Andrei Tarkovsky)

An epic meditation on art, faith, and suffering. Dickinson cites it as a major influence on his sense of rhythm and atmosphere. Screening Friday, September 26 in 35mm.

“Manila in the Claws of Light” (dir. Lino Brocka)

A politically charged neorealist masterpiece that follows a young man navigating poverty, exploitation, and disillusionment in 1970s Manila. Its stark beauty and social urgency resonate deeply with the themes of Urchin. Harris will introduce the Thursday, October 9 screening.

	President Donald Trump cannot pronounce “acetaminophen” — not on the first try, at least. He does, however, feel he is qualified to tell American women that if they take it during pregnancy they might give their children autism.


	The declaration came during a joint press event on Monday. Trump — flanked by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Dr. Mehmet Oz — said that “effective immediately” the Food and Drug Administration “will be notifying physicians that the use of acetaminophen,” commonly sold under the brand name Tylenol, “during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism.” 


	Trump told reporters that he was dispensing vaccine advice based on “common sense” and “what I feel,” and the administration's new guidance on Tylenol similarly does not seem to be based on science. No established link exists between acetaminophen — one of the most common and effective pain and fever reduces in the world — and Autism Spectrum Disorders. The existing body of research is limited, contradictory, and difficult to replicate. The president, who once suggested using bleach to kill Covid-19, and Kennedy, a raw milk evangelist who seems allergic to academic research, are nevertheless charging ahead with the dubious advice. 

	











	“Taking Tylenol is not good,” Trump claimed, contradicting decades of data indicating it is perfectly safe. “Don't take Tylenol. Don't take it. Fight like hell not to take it.” he said, suggesting women simply “tough it out” through pain or fever during pregnancy.

	Kennedy added that “clinical laboratory studies” suggested a “potential association between acetaminophen used during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.”


	Autism researchers and obstetrics experts were appalled. 


	“Paracetamol (acetaminophen) does not cause autism, ADHD, or learning disabilities,” Dr. Monique Botha, associate professor in social and developmental psychology at Durham University, tells Rolling Stone. “That is something that I can confidently say.”

	Botha, whose work and research focuses on Autism Spectrum Disorders, adds that the studies suggesting correlation — not causation — did not control for things like genetics and family history: “As soon as you control for those things, any correlation like that essentially disappears.” It's a reality even the FDA acknowledged in its announcement of the administration's new guidance. “It is important to note that while an association between acetaminophen and neurological conditions has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature,” the FDA wrote in its public statement. 


	Kennedy has, for decades now, promoted claims that vaccines are responsible for increased rates of autism diagnoses in children, a phenomenon experts agree is more closely related to increased awareness and ability to identify the condition. In April, Kennedy publicly vowed to conduct a “massive testing and research effort” through HHS to find the causes of Autism Spectrum Disorders. “By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we'll be able to eliminate those exposures,” Kennedy said at the time.


	Botha notes that the causes of autism have been researched for decades, and largely point to a multi-factor originating largely based on biology — not pharmaceutical exposure. “There's plenty of research, decades of research. If you said I had to nail myself to one answer, I would say that it is primarily genetic and inheritable.”

	What's more concerning in Botha's view is that the administration's description of Autism Spectrum Disorders as an “epidemic” — as something to pin blame for and eliminate — is dehumanizing language that veers into eugenics. 


	“Autistic people are dehumanized, we know that from other research, as well,” Botha says. “This adds to that dehumanization, because it's this obsession with ‘Why do you exist? Why are you here?' It adds to this persistent feeling that autistic people report on, which is that they know that society would rather they did not exist. … Autistic people and their families, are deserving of respect, are deserving of adequate support, this is the last thing those families need” 

	











	Botha notes that the majority of monetary funding for autism research and resources tend to be directed towards finding the mythical single cause of the condition, instead of providing material support to autistic people and their families, or improving the public's understanding of the disorder.  The National Institute of Health on Monday announced a $50 million Autism Data Science Initiative to “unlock the causes and improve outcomes.” 


	Eric Garcia, journalist at The Independent and author of We're Not Broken: Changing the Autism Conversation, tells Rolling Stone that Kennedy is leading a “really a return to the blame game around autism.” 


	“Is it the vaccines? Is it the mold? Is it the Tylenol? It's looking for someone to blame. But that doesn't do anything — that doesn't fix anything for autistic people. If anything, it distracts from the ability to rebuild the world for autistic people and heal the world for them,” Garcia says.


	In the absence of actual science, the president offered up mad-libs rambling falsely insisting that communities that refuse to take “pills” or that avoid vaccines have nonexistent rates of Autism. 


	“I think I can say that there are certain groups of people that don't take any vaccines or don't take any pills that have no autism,” he said on Monday. “You have certain groups, the Amish, as an example, they have essentially no autism.” Trump added that “there's a rumor” that there is “virtually no autism” in Cuba because “they don't have money for Tylenol.” (This is false.)


	It is clear to Garcia that the administration “wanted to find something” to fulfill its public promises, and was willing to throw out whatever they could find — in this case, blaming acetaminophen.


	On Tuesday, the World Health Organization issued a statement clarifying that there is “inconsistent” evidence on the matter, and that the “lack of replicability [for past studies] really calls for caution in drawing casual conclusions.”


	The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), meanwhile, affirmed that they had not changed their recommendations of the use of acetaminophen by pregnant women, and considered it safe. (Last year, researchers at Drexel University conducted a large-scale study of 2.5 million births in Sweden between 1995 to 2019, and found no direct causal risk related to the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy.)


	“Suggestions that acetaminophen use in pregnancy causes autism are not only highly concerning to clinicians but also irresponsible when considering the harmful and confusing message they send to pregnant patients, including those who may need to rely on this beneficial medicine during pregnancy,” ACOD President Steven J. Fleischman wrote in a statement. “Acetaminophen is one of the few options available to pregnant patients to treat pain and fever, which can be harmful to pregnant people when left untreated. … The conditions people use acetaminophen to treat during pregnancy are far more dangerous than any theoretical risks and can create severe morbidity and mortality for the pregnant person and the fetus.” 

	











	In a statement provided to Rolling Stone, Kenvue — the manufacturer of Tylenol — indicated their belief that “independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned about the health risks and confusion this poses for expecting mothers and parents.” 


	“The facts are that over a decade of rigorous research, endorsed by leading medical professionals and global health regulators, confirms there is no credible evidence linking acetaminophen to autism,” Kenvue continued. “We stand with the many public health and medical professionals who have reviewed this science and agree.” 


	Public health experts, research, and medical professionals have long been struggling to compete with outright falsehoods being broadcast at max volume from the most powerful political office on the planet. “It's demoralizing,” Botha says.


	Even more demoralizing than the lies and stigma being promoted by the president may be the callousness with which he presents them. At one point during Monday's press conference, Trump took one of his rhetorical detours into a complaint about Ozempic, which he says he calls “the fat drug,” and how it's cheaper overseas because the U.S. is “subsidizing the rest of the world” but it's “nothing compared to autism.”

Theo Von slammed the Department of Homeland Security for using his viral comedy clips in their promotional videos for deportations. On Tuesday, the DHS shared an upload that opened with Von saying, “Heard you got deported, dude, bye!” The moment was clipped from a longer video, which includes the critical context of the podcast host meeting a fan who asked if he could record a video for a friend who had been deported.


	“Yooo DHS i didnt approve to be used in this,” Von wrote on X. “I know you know my address so send a check. And please take this down and please keep me out of your ‘banger' deportation videos. When it comes to immigration my thoughts and heart are alot more nuanced than this video allows. Bye!”

Yooo DHS i didnt approve to be used in this. I know you know my address so send a check. And please take this down and please keep me out of your ‘banger' deportation videos. When it comes to immigration my thoughts and heart are alot more nuanced than this video allows. Bye! https://t.co/5v5gagf4Dr


	The DHS and official White House social media accounts have been attempting to capitalize on viral trends to promote the mass deportations occurring across the country. In the video Von criticized, for example, the clip is followed by scenes in which people are being handcuffed and transported for deportation. It brags about the removal of “2 million [people] in 250 days,” and includes a clip of Donald Trump saying immigrants have “simply stopped coming.”

	











	In late July, the White House tried to jump on the “Jet2 Holiday” commercial meme — which features Jess Glynne's 2015 hit single “Hold My Hand” — to promote U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportations. The caption read: “When ICE books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation. ✈️🎶 Nothing beats it!” It accompanied a video of multiple men restrained in hand and leg cuffs being deported. Conveniently, the ICE agents faces were blurred out, but not the people they detained. 

	











	If the goal is to make the Trump administration's efforts look cool or less sinister, their memes are only doing the opposite. “This post honestly makes me sick,” Glynne said at the time. “My music is about love, unity, and spreading positivity, never about division or hate.”

	“It's amazing and it's scary because you don't have control. I'm grateful for it, but at the same time, it's very lawless in that world. People can make whatever they want,” Von told Rolling Stone in 2023 about his fear of losing ownership or control over his viral content. “We've created an environment where one thing that gets out there can make it so that that's all you are.”


	Von hosted Trump on his podcast, This Past Weekend, ahead of the 2024 presidential election, and JD Vance earlier this year. Meanwhile, this past weekend, reports emerged that two American military cargo jets deported people to Africa on flights that appear to have had their transponders turned off, preventing tracking by obscuring their locations from public flight databases and other nearby aircraft. The secret flights are part of what appears to be a surge in ICE activity across the African continent, following a pressure campaign led by Trump on many of the governments there over the summer.

One of Ethan Hawke's greatest attributes as an actor is that he makes things look easy. That's not to say that the star doesn't put the work in — you don't get Emmy and Tony nominations, write several books, and direct your own films when you're just coasting.

But since his emergence as a movie star in the '90s, the Austin-born actor has always had a laidback, easygoing vibe that's made his movie star swagger seem effortless and allowed him to sink convincingly into most every part he's ever taken. That attitude made him something of a Gen X icon in his day, when he starred in films like “Reality Bites” and “Before Sunrise.” As he's gotten older, he hasn't lost that sense of cool, but has brought it to older, wiser, and more seasoned characters, like the hip if immature father he brought to life in “Boyhood.” And, when Hawke departs from those types with roles he doesn't seem an obvious fit for, he shows that he's more than capable of shedding that image for something more severe, like with his transformative and stunning work in Paul Schrader's “First Reformed.”

Breaking through with 1989's “Dead Poets Society,” Hawke has also shown himself to have great taste in film roles, constantly choosing interesting projects that have kept him fairly prominent throughout his decades in Hollywood. His most consistent collaborator is Richard Linklater, with whom he first worked with for “Before Sunrise,” eventually co-writing the sequels to the film alongside his co-star Julie Delpy. He also worked with him on “Boyhood,” gaining much acclaim for his performance in the time-hopping coming-of-age drama. Through his career, he's starred in great films, co-wrote quite a few of them, and even directed a few of his own, including “Chelsea Walls,” “The Hottest State,” and the HBO Max documentary series “The Last Movie Stars.” And he's shown that his star power can translate to TV, where's he's given great performances in series like “Moon Knight” and especially “The Good Lord Bird.”

With Hawke starring in the new TV series “The Lowdown,” IndieWire has taken the liberty of going through his filmography to rank the best of his greatest performances. This list includes both movie roles and the rare TV appearance, including his work on “The Good Lord Bird” and “Reservation Dogs.” Read on for Ethan Hawke's 10 best performances, ranked.

A defining text of mid-'90s Gen X disenchantment, “Reality Bites” is not a particularly good movie: the characters are shrill and unlikable, the plot is preachy and basic, and Helen Childress' script has a smug, too-cool-for-school attitude that's aged horrendously after 30 years. Hawke doesn't necessarily escape the film's problems: his character, coffeehouse singer-songwriter Troy, is a thin stereotype of a hot '90s slacker, wildly unlikable despite the film wanting you to fall for him. That said, this is arguably the project that did the most to cement Hawke's star image, and there's undeniably appeal to his soulful, snarky performance, which shows real star quality that's downright nostalgic to see in a Hollywood production these days. His chemistry with Winona Ryder is almost enough to make their characters' romance work, even if the script keeps getting in the way.

An underseen gem, “Born to Be Blue” presents a semi-fictionalized look at the life of famed jazz trumpeter Chet Baker, focusing particularly on his recovery from a mugging incident in the '60s that lead to the destruction of his teeth and damaged his ability to play his beloved instrument. Hawke nearly played a younger version of Baker in a Richard Linklater film that never came to fruition; his performance in Robert Budreau's film is better for the experience and vulnerability he brings to the role with his age, despite his underlying boyish charm. Hawke learned to play the trumpet himself for the role, his inexperience with the instrument working with the context of Baker trying to recover from his accident, and nails a warbling, sensitive performance of the song “I've Never Been in Love Before.” The film doesn't sugercoat any of Baker's faults, from his neediness to his general immaturity, but Hawke is raw and sensitive enough that you want to forgive him all the same.

One of Hawke's most well-remembered films from the '90s, thanks in part to becoming a lazy day in high school science class staple watch, “Gattaca” is also an intelligent and thoughtful warning of the potential impact of eugenics, imagining a future where parents use genetic selection to conceive their children. For Hawke's Vincent Freeman, who was born without any genetic selection, that means a lifetime of discrimination, getting barred from high-paying work and his dreams of going to space being denied. But he gets a chance at a new life when he begins impersonating Jude Law's Jerome Morrow, a swim champion who was paralyzed in an accident. In an often chilly sci-fi film, the earthy Hawke is excellent casting: he's certainly attractive, but almost seems of an entirely different era than the unnaturally beautiful Law, with a wide-eyed sense of wonder that sells Vincent's very earnest dreams. Also, the set of the film is where Hawke met his former wife Uma Thurman, and the two share unsurprisingly great chemistry that gives the film's romance real charge. 

Hawke was just 18 years old when he broke through as the sweet, sensitive Todd in “Dead Poets Society,” Peter Weir's beloved coming-of-age drama about Robin Williams' John Keating, who inspires a group of dissatisfied boarding school boys to “seize the day” and pursue their passions. At his then-young age, the actor has much of the sensitivity that would make him a great performer later on his career, proving very believable as a shy, sheltered teen with low confidence who slowly emerges from his shell. Most importantly, he has excellent chemistry with Robert Sean Leonard as Todd's best friend Neil, developing a sweet friendship that makes the film's ultimate tragedy all the more painful. In an earnest, inspirational tearjerker, it's Hawke's performance that gives the story much of its emotional core.

“Reservation Dogs” is an incredible show for many reasons, with some of the best writing, direction, and acting of any series this decade. One of its greatest attributes, though, is its ability to expand beyond its central cast of four Native teens living on an Oklahoma reservation and flesh out the community around them, leading to a sprawling ensemble where every player has texture and humanity. For its penultimate episode, the show was even able to flex a bit by abandoning nearly the entire cast for a standalone story focusing on Elora (the phenomenal Devery Jacobs) as she locates the father she never met for financial information. Casting a movie star like Hawke in the role could feel like stunt casting, but it never feels like it watching “Elora's Dad”; he sinks into the lowkey, bittersweet tone of the show immediately, never overplaying the emotions that come from this reluctant reconnection. He's excellent with Jacobs in particular, his regretful sweetness contrasting beautifully with her spiky disposition, and making for one of a great show's very best episodes. It's an excellent preview of what Hawke and series creator Sterlin Harjo could accomplish in their followup collaboration “The Lowdown.”

Divisive at the time, and still today, Michael Almereyda's 2000 contemporary version of “Hamlet” is nonetheless one of the most interesting Shakespeare films ever made, transforming the classical tragedy into a paranoia-drenched sort of techno thriller about the evolving technology of the time and the feeling of being constantly under surveillance. Hawke's performance was also a bit divisive, rendering the Prince of Denmark as a mopey-eyed film student and heir to a major corporation, with many critics preferring the rest of the ensemble (most notably Julia Stiles' devastating Ophelia or Kyle MacLachlan's scheming Claudius). But his performance, which emphasizes the more pathetic parts of the Prince's nature, works well in this film's feverish context, sucking out the grandiosity of the character in favor of something petulant and infantile. It's not what you think of when you think of Shakespearean acting, but in a way, it's more honest and insightful about the character than many other renditions you've seen before. And when the film asks him to, Hawke delivers, with a sensitivity that makes Hamlet unmistakably human.

Famously filmed over the course of 11 years with production starting and stopping to track the coming-of-age of its main character, Richard Linklater's “Boyhood” derives a lot of pleasure from seeing how its ensemble of actors evolves over the years. Nowhere is that more evident than with Ethan Hawke's performance as Mason's (Ellar Coltrane) irresponsible, reckless father, semi-estranged from his kids at first after his divorce from their mother. Hawke was 32 with two very young kids of his own when production began; by the time it ended in 2013, he was in his forties, and the experience of raising his own children (and going through his own divorce) clearly seeped into the extra level of tenderness and sweetness he brought to the role. In a poignant film about the passage of time, watching Hawke transform his character from a wash-up to someone Mason can be proud to call his father makes for the most satisfying, moving arc.

Criminally underseen and underappreciated, “The Good Lord Bird” features Hawke playing an undersung American hero, abolitionist John Brown, who raided federal armories in an attempt to begin a slave revolt. Told from the point of view of Onion (Joshua Caleb Johnson), a fictional enslaved boy who joins Brown's soldiers, the show follows Brown's life with plenty of reverence, which could slide into hero-worshipping. But Hawke nails a tricky, difficult part: his Brown is bombastic and theatrical, prone to launching into sermons and speeches at a moment's notice, but with real conviction and purpose behind everything he says, and the actor never winks to the audience or undercuts the real sincere humanity behind Brown's beliefs. It's an astonishingly ferocious portrait of revolutionary fire packed with adrenaline. 

Nothing about the “Before” trilogy of films, Richard Linklater's opus about an American man and a French woman who meet by chance on a train and their two-decade-ish love story, would work if the stars didn't have the type of lightning-in-a-bottle chemistry casting directors dream of. It took the director nine months to finalize casting for the characters of Jesse and Céline for “Before Sunrise,” before he eventually got Hawke and Julie Delpy together for a final reading. In the film that resulted, the two have such a swoony, instant spark that you can understand exactly why they would fall for each other immediately, and both have a perfect handle on the bantering, erudite, circular dialogue that the movie is built upon. Over two sequels, the characters' relationship got to grow more complicated, and it's a joy to see the actors' grow with their characters. Hawke, deep in his dreamy Gen X heartthrob era in the first film, manages to keep the traits that make Jesse unique — his swagger, intelligence, playfulness — while also showing his evolution from immature young man to older, flawed husband. And when Hawke smashes the big blowout fight between Jesse and Céline that “Before Midnight” builds up to out of the park, you get the sense that his younger self from the first film wouldn't have been capable of delivering it.

Hawke, remarkably, was not Oscar-nominated for his performance in “First Reformed,” his finest work as an actor. Had Paul Schrader's morally murky psychological thriller received more critical attention, he very well could have (and probably should have) won. He's that great as Reverend Ernst Toller, the minister of a small historical church in Upstate New York whose worldview is shaken when he provides spiritual council to a radical environmentalist and his pregnant wife. With a deep set brow of worry and stiff body posture, Hawke ably conveys the image of a man haunted by his past actions and with deep convictions for how to repent. With Toller such an internal character, we chart most of his change not through words or actions, but through Hawke's face, how his eyes flash with shock, doubt, anger, and disgust. When Toller makes his final choice at the end of the film, it's thanks to Hawke's work that it's not shocking at all. Few actors have been capable of a performance as spiritually distraught as this.

River Cartwright is a mess. Or that's what people keep telling him, anyway.

Following last season's reunion-spoiling revelations about his father (ex-CIA operative Frank Harkness) and his father's past (raising children to be super-soldiers), the galloping young stallion (played by Jack Lowden) hasn't been able to screw his head on straight. Lamb (Gary Oldman) unfavorably compares him to a “crack-up, a drunk, [and] a psychopath.” Standish (Saskia Reeves) reprimands River for not dealing with his issues as well as he could (a.k.a. her version of Lamb's blistering reproach). And Louisa (Rosalind Eleazar) lays it out as plainly as can be: “You're a mess,” she says. “You're not allowing yourself to feel things that you should be feeling.”

But River doesn't see it, and frankly, neither do we. Sure, he snaps at Shirley (Aimee-Ffion Edwards) for no good reason, and yeah, his instincts aren't as attuned as one would hope. (He makes an obviously errant pass at the worst possible moment.) But River has always been rough around the edges. His blunt bullheadedness is part of what landed him in Slough House, MI5's storage locker for damaged agents, but it's also what's helped the haphazard team save the day, time and again, season after season.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






So what's the truth? Is River in desperate need of some R&R, or is everyone else projecting their own predicaments onto him? Well, after five seasons of Will Smith's savvy Apple series, there's little question as to who's right in this regard: It's Lamb. Our foul, flatulent father-figure may exaggerate a bit when belittling his enemies (and friends, for that matter), but cloaked under his aura of filth — like an adult Pig-Pen's toxic dust cloud — rests a core truth. So as soon as Lamb backs a team he's wont to disagree with, any mystery around River's mental health status is settled: He's a mess.

Even with one false impression exposed, splits in perception become a running theme of Season 5. When Roddy (Christopher Chung) almost gets hit by a van, Shirley claims she saved him from an intentional attack. But Roddy argues she was just “looking for an excuse to sexually harass me” and demands reimbursement for his damaged clothes. Is someone trying to kill him, or is Shirley's personal loss (Marcus, last season) making her paranoid? Later, Roddy needs to look his best for a date with a woman way out of his league, yet his inflexible ego — and a cozy night at the club — make their shared passions seem weirdly plausible. Did Roddy, of all people, find love, or is she… being paid for her services (as his peers repeatedly contend)? 

 










Distinguishing the appearance of truth from truth itself isn't limited to individuals, either. Season 5 is set in a country gone “fucking mad.” When a campaign volunteer for the mayor gets killed by a gunman who supports the opposition, investigators prepare for the ramifications of a political attack. But when it turns out the shooter — who police initially believed had taken his own life — was, in fact, shot by someone else, the assumed situation spawns question after question: Who? When? Why?

As more strange situations sweep London, our favorite scruffy spies must decide what, who, and how much to believe. Is this a particularly bad week, filled with normal crises at an abnormal pace, or is there some sort of grand conspiracy connecting each bizarre emergency? Who among them should they listen to (besides Lamb), and whose vision is being clouded by personal bias? But also, how much is too much? If one far-fetched theory is proven credible, what other previously disregarded ideas merit reconsideration?

Invigorating in its temerity, Smith's six-episode Season 5 is told with propulsive clarity (save for the mysteries you're intended to guess at). Chaos is sorted into appreciable story arcs without diluting its overwhelming effect on our heroes. The element of chance isn't treated as a convenient plot device, nor is it pushed aside entirely so a grand plan can click into place. Best of all, Slough House's ability to make sense of the senseless becomes their key to saving the day. We may not always be able to separate reality from perception — sometimes differing perceptions simply can't coexist — but we can still respect and value actual intelligence, especially when it's used to solve public problems. 

 










Problems “Slow Horses” directly links to anti-intellectualists, ignorant bullies, and willful distorters of the historical record — natural enemies of any self-respecting spy. They don't call them intelligence agents for nothing, and Season 5 is a nice reminder of their basic function: not only to know more than your Average Joe, but to apply that knowledge toward keeping the peace. 

River, very much looking the part of an internet boyfriend on the rise, is a mess, and Lamb, the living embodiment of “don't judge a book by his cover,” makes for the perfect person to call him out. If we can all agree the clean-cut, handsome kid is more mixed-up than the slovenly old man about to clear the room with his farts, then maybe there's hope yet for a shared reality rooted in truth. Fingers crossed.

“Slow Horses” Season 5 premieres Wednesday, September 24 on Apple TV+. New episodes will be released weekly through the finale on October 29. The series has been renewed through Season 7.

Tuesday night, September 23, marked Jimmy Kimmel's return to the air after Jimmy Kimmel Live! was pulled by ABC last week under pressure from the Trump administration. Kimmel had made a joke about the man alleged to have shot and killed right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, prompting Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair Brendan Carr to threaten the network, which is owned by the Walt Disney Company, with retaliation. Find Kimmel's complete opening monologue from his return below.

Kimmel took the stage to cheers of “Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!” He began by remarking, “I'm not sure who had a weirder 48 hours, me or the CEO of Tylenol,” and expressed his gratitude to his fellow late-night talk show hosts and the audience for their support. Kimmel made a point to thank conservative pundits and politicians including Ben Shapiro, Candace Owens, and Texas Senator Ted Cruz by name: “Even though I don't agree with many of those people on most subjects—some of the things they say even make me want to throw up—it takes courage for them to speak up against this administration, and they did and they deserve credit for it.”

Kimmel continued, “I do want to make something clear because it's important to me as a human, and that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man.” He also acknowledged CBS' recent cancellation of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. “I've had the opportunity to meet and spend time with comedians and talk show hosts from countries like Russia, countries in the Middle East,” Kimmel remarked. “Our freedom to speak is what they admire most about this country, and that's something I'm embarrassed to say I took for granted until they pulled my friend Stephen off the air and tried to coerce the affiliates who run our show in the cities you live in to take my show off the air. That's not legal; that's not American—that's un-American.”

At one point, Kimmel quoted a 2022 social media post from Brendan Carr during his tenure as FCC commissioner: “Political satire is one of the oldest and most important forms of free speech. It challenges those in power while humor to draw more people into the discussion. That's why people in influential positions have always targeted it for censorship.” A later segment featured Robert De Niro loosely impersonating the now-FCC chair—a reference to De Niro's role in Martin Scorsese's 1990 mob drama Goodfellas and a recent comment from Cruz comparing Carr to a “mafioso.”

Addressing his current relationship with the network, Kimmel said, “We talked it through, and, at the end, even though they didn't have to… they welcomed me back on the air. Unfortunately, and, I think, unjustly, this puts them at risk. The president of the United States made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs.” He concluded his monologue by discussing the speech given by Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, during a memorial service organized by Turning Point USA, the conservative organization the late activist co-founded: “On Sunday, Erika Kirk forgave the man who shot her husband. That is an example we should follow. If you believe in the teachings of Jesus, as I do, there it was. That's it. A selfless act of grace, forgiveness from a grieving widow. It touched me deeply. It touches many, and, if there's anything we should take from this tragedy to carry forward, it should be that, and not this.”

Notably, this evening's episode of Kimmel did not air on all ABC stations nationwide. The TV station groups Sinclair and Nexstar, which together control over 20 percent of the network's local affiliates, had previously announced that they would pre-empt the show indefinitely on their programming schedules. Nexstar is currently trying to close a $6.2 billion merger with a rival TV company that will require FCC approval.

Sarah McLachlan was the musical guest on Kimmel tonight. She performed a solo piano rendition of the title track from the new album Better Broken. McLachlan recently canceled her scheduled performance at the premiere event for Disney+'s Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery documentary, which took place on Sunday, September 21, “in support of free speech.” Watch her sing “Better Broken” below.

Jimmy Kimmel returned to ABC's late-night line-up tonight—well, in some markets. Though FCC Chair Brendan Carr's comments last week have inspired Sinclair and Nexstar broadcast groups to continue preempting Kimmel's show, the host delivered a heartfelt and, dare we say, historic monologue to the rest of America. Those serviced by Sinclair and Nexstar will have to search it out on YouTube.

Kimmel received a hero's welcome at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood as he rattled off the names of people who offered words of support to the comedian. Late-night hosts from around the world reached out to Kimmel, who got a job offer from a German late-night show. “This country has become so authoritarian,” Kimmel said, “That Germans are like, ‘Come here. Come here.'”



But while many reached out to Kimmel with kind words, the host had even kinder ones for those who were not fans. “I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” he said. A choked-up Kimmel delivered conciliatory comments to those who took offense to the comments that got him pulled from the air.

“I have no illusions about changing anyone's mind, but I do want to make something clear because it's important to me as a human,” he said. “It was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man. I don't think there's anything funny about it. I posted a message on Instagram the day he was killed, asking for compassion, and I meant it.”

“It was never my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what was obviously a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make, but I understand that to some, it felt either insensitive or unclear, or maybe both. For those who think I pointed a finger, I get why you're upset.”

Kimmel also took a moment to thank Disney for creating space for a show that could potentially catch the ire of the federal government for the last 23 years, while also making light of the consumer revolt in the wake of Kimmel's suspension. Not to mention, he thanked his viewers for the revolt and demanded that those same people show up for Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers should the president target them.

He was less gracious toward FCC Chair Brendan Carr, whom he characterized as “the most embarrassing car Republicans have embraced” since the Cybertruck. He pointed out Carr and Trump's blatant hypocrisy and the betrayal of their so-called free speech ideals. “The President of the United States made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs,” Kimmel said. “Our leader celebrates Americans losing their jobs because he can't take a joke.”

That's not to say the monologue was all Kimmel choking back tears and setting records straight—though there was plenty of that. He also continued his tradition of saying things that would irritate the president. Namely, after a week of claiming that Kimmel has “no ratings.” Kimmel's response: “Well, I do tonight.”

“You almost have to feel sorry for him,” said Kimmel. “He tried his best to cancel me. Instead, he forced millions of people to watch the show. That backfired bigly. He might have to release the Epstein files to distract us from this.”

While much of the Star Wars discourse has moved on from the sequel trilogy, actor John Boyega continues to make it clear that Disney's shortcomings were not his fault. Few could blame the actor for having a complicated relationship with the movies. From the very second he appeared on screen, he was subject to racist vitriol that continued throughout the release cycle. That his character, Finn, never developed a coherent arc didn't help. After the series petered out with Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker, which revealed Finn to be a space equestrian, Boyega made his issues with Disney, particularly its handling of non-white characters, very well known. Appearing at Florida Supercon 2025, per Popverse, Boyega, once again, got candid about how the sequel trilogy and how he would've made a “whole completely different thing” had he been a producer.

Boyega says that if he were wearing his producer hat on Star Wars, he wouldn't be “getting rid of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, all these people.” Instead, the “first thing we're going to do is fulfill their story, their legacy.” He envisions “a good moment of handing on the baton.” He also criticizes the new characters, saying that some of them were overpowered, echoing some of the criticisms surrounding Rey in The Force Awakens. “They won't just grab stuff and know what to do with it,” he said. “You've got to struggle like every other character in this franchise. I'd do that.”

He also would change the ending of The Last Jedi. “But Luke Skywalker wouldn't be disappearing on a rock,” he continued. “Hell no. Standing there, and he's, like, a projector? I would want to give those characters way more way more.” It's not too surprising that most of his complaints, like those of many fans, are about The Last Jedi. In a 2023 appearance on the Hot Ones spin-off, Truth Or Dab: Rapid Fire, he declared The Last Jedi the worst of his three entries. “But they're all lovely,” he clarified while shooting a side-eyed glance.

Finding a babysitter can be murder, and The Hand That Rocks The Cradle is back to scare young parents out of another date night.

The cradle now rocks on streaming as this remake of the classic murderous nanny movie heads to Hulu this October. Based on Curtis Hanson's 1992 original, the remake follows young mother Caitlin Morales (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) as she welcomes a new nanny, Polly Murphy (Maika Monroe), into her family. Polly came with impeccable references that, nevertheless, neglected to mention her penchant for self-mutilation and maternal manipulation. At least we can take solace in the fact that the nanny isn't an AI.

﻿

The Hand That Rocks The Cradle hits Hulu on October 22.

Ratboys shared their last album, the Chris Walla–produced The Window, in 2023. Now, they're back with a new song and a new label home. Also co-produced with Walla, “Light Night Mountains All That” is the Chicago rock band's debut single for New West Records. Ratboys drummer Marcus Nuccio directed the accompanying music video. Watch it below.

“My original idea was to write an ultra-high energy folk song, in the style of the Dodos' Visiter, with somewhat spooky, mysterious, and pastoral lyrics—like what Chris Otepka of the Heligoats might conjure up on a mushroom trip,” Ratboys singer Julia Steiner said of the process behind the new single in a statement. “[The] guys and I nearly went insane fleshing out the arrangement and its odd timings together. I wrote the lyrics during that original demoing trip, centered around the idea of a fantastic, rural vision-quest where the days and nights blend together and nothing is quite as it seems.”

Ratboys have also announced a 2026 tour of North America, which kicks off February 25 in Detroit, Michigan and runs through mid-April. They're set to perform at Pitchfork Music Festival London this November, too. Scroll down to see all of Ratboys' upcoming shows.

Russian tech startup Neiry has become the first in the world to insert neuro-implants into cow brains to increase milk yield when all other methods are exhausted.

Neiry announced its intention to begin testing its neuro-implants on live cows back in April. Last month, its specialists performed surgeries on five cows to fit them with a stimulator attached to the back of the head and electrodes that penetrate deep into the brain. With the help of these devices, they hope to reach areas responsible for appetite, stress, and reproductive function, and stimulate them through electric impulses. The first tests were performed in Russia's Sverdlovsk region, and so far, the results are very encouraging.

According to Neiry investor Alexey Mariza, in many dairy cow farms, all measures to increase production have already been implemented, so radically new approaches like neuro-implant brain stimulation have the potential to significantly disrupt the dairy production industry and provide a significant competitive advantage.

According to a recent report by the Russian news agency Ria Novosti, Neiry specialists performed surgeries on five cows to fit them with special neuro-implants. The cows were conscious during the implantation process, survived the procedure without any noticeable side effects, and returned to the production cycle. Although the company has yet to release official data on the effects of the implants on milk production, Neiry claims that the cows' milk production improved.

Scientists are currently working on selecting the optimal stimulation program depending on the area they are trying to stimulate: for example, when a cow's appetite decreases, the system selects the appropriate neuromodulation mode for recovery. Neiry admits they still have work to do to improve their neuro-implants, but the Russian company considers they already work well enough to be sold commercially in the near future.

Not everyone is impressed with Neiry's cow brain neuro-implants. For example, Andrey Neduzhko, General Director of the Steppe agricultural holding, believes the implants carry unnecessary risks for the animals and are unprofitable because of their exorbitant price. However, Neiry claims that it has already identified ways of significantly lowering the prices of its products, one of which involves carrying out the implantation in a proprietary mobile operating room.

Colter Shaw (Justin Hartley) is back, looking for missing people in Tracker Season 3. The hit CBS series returns next month on October 19, and with just a few weeks remaining, CBS has released a teaser trailer. In it, Colter is back on the road, traversing the roads of rural and urban America in the search for those lost. His job pits him against nature and people, and in some instances, the only way out is through punches. Meanwhile, he's dealing with some recent discoveries about his family. The season premiere features a Shaw Family reunion as he joins forces with his brother Russell (Jensen Ackles) to find two missing women. The logline for Tracker Season 3, Episode 1, "The Process," reads:

"As Colter grapples with the shocking truth surrounding his father's death, Russell joins forces with his brother to help track down the missing wife and daughter of one of Reenie's clients. Their reunion finds them mixed up in a chain of events involving a sinister underground operation known as "The Process."

Tracker introduced a mystery in the pilot episode about the death of Ashton Shaw. The show has been peeling back layers of the story throughout the past two seasons, reaching an inflection point in the Season 2 finale. The show aims to tackle that head-on in the Season 3 premiere. "He's still sifting through the results of that meeting, and some of the questions he has about his father, when Russell arrives to pull him out of his funk,” showrunner Elwood Reid said in an interview while previewing the upcoming season. He added,

"They talk through what happened, and it's an interesting scene, because you get to hear the two brothers talk about the different ways they feel about [the night their father died] and what they still carry with them. And then, of course, a case jumps off, and that conversation about their family continues through the rest of the episode in an exciting way."

The show will continue to explore this mystery and the fallout from Ashton's death. “What was the father involved in — we're going to answer that — and how much do you blame your mother for her actions?” teased Reid. Tracker returns on CBS on Sunday, October 19 at 8 p.m. ET. The season premiere was written by the showrunner and directed by Ken Olin.

ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. – St. Augustine is one of my favorite north Florida cities and has been for many years. 

My memories of St. Augustine and St. Johns County go back to my childhood. 

My parents favored the off-season for travel, and this often found us in popular spots with very few people. On one of these trips, we got a behind-the-scenes look at the Castillo de San Marcos, which led to us firing a cannon…allegedly. 

I remember when you could turn right at the Fort Matanzas Beach Drive Access and hide under the bridge before EZ-UP tents.

Thanks to my hobbies of running, cycling and riding motorcycles, I have gotten to know the county backroads intimately. 

The St. Augustine Lighthouse has been my beacon for runs and rides, and it's been a place I've wanted to explore ever since I saw that famous episode of TAPS (The Atlantic Paranormal Society), aka Ghost Hunters, around 2006 to 2008, and then again in 2019.

To be a part of a paranormal investigation at the St. Augustine Lighthouse has been a bucket list item since, and with the help of some coworkers, we got to make that happen.

Press play below to join us on a fun night of things that go bump in the night at the St. Augustine Lighthouse and Maritime Museum.

Inspired by the real-life horrors of a notorious Maryland psychiatric hospital that preyed upon Black communities for decades, Crowsville #1 kicks off a five-part comic series on November 5 from Oni Press.

Written by Rodney Barnes (“The Boondocks,” Killadelphia) and illustrated by Elia Bonetti (Death of Wolverine: The Logan Legacy), we have an exclusive look inside the first issue below.

Founded at the turn of the 20th century outside of Annapolis, Maryland, the Crownsville Hospital was a notoriously segregated, all-Black psychiatric institute. After decades of overcrowding and neglect — alongside darker, more-persistent rumors of patient abuse and illegal medical experiments — it was finally closed.

Today, it stands condemned—a crumbling testament to a legacy of all-too-real terror inflicted on a marginalized and vulnerable community. But even as a ruin of its former self, Crownsville still casts a long shadow…

When an unexplained death inside the abandoned hospital is ruled a suicide, Annapolis police detective Mike Simms and journalist Paul Blairare are compelled to dig deeper, only to discover the reality of the horrors that once took place there… and the powerful connection they share to the anguished spirits of the dead that are still locked within its walls.

The 48-page first issue of Crownsville features covers by Bonetti, Barnes' Killadelphia co-creator Jason Shawn Alexander (Spawn), Syzmon Kudranski (The Punisher), and Andrea Sorrentino (Gideon Falls).

A statement from a national organization of architects regarding the alleged misuse of the word “architect” in negative news contexts has sparked discussion among Filipinos.

The United Architects of the Philippines (UAP) released an open letter, saying it “strongly denounces the persistent misuse of the word ‘architect'” when “describing masterminds of plunder, corruption, crime, or other negative acts.” It was signed by its national president, architect Jonathan Manalad.

“Recent headlines and articles — such as referring to a government official as an ‘architect of plunder' — reflect a long-standing trend of equating the word ‘architect' with the mastermind of wrongdoings,” the organization said on Tuesday, September 23.

Recent headlines in the Philippines have focused on alleged corruption in flood control projects, with claims that government officials and lawmakers received kickbacks from these initiatives.

“This is not only misleading but gravely unjust to a profession that has, for centuries, been dedicated to the highest ideals of public service, safety, progress, and nation building,” the UAP added.

It also shared the definition of an architect as stated by the Architecture Act of 2004, which it said is “is a person professionally and academically qualified, registered, and licensed under the law, with the authority to practice architecture and responsible for the planning, design, construction, enlargement, conservation, renovation, remodeling, or alteration of buildings and the environment for human habitation.”

“Words matter,” the group said, adding that using “architect” in news reports as a synonym for ‘mastermind of crime' supposedly “corrodes public perception of the profession, trivializes years of education, licensure, and ethical responsibility, and undermines the trust that architects have worked hard to earn from the Filipino people.”

The UAP suggested that the media use words or phrases like “mastermind,” “perpetrator,” or “brains behind corruption” instead.

“The United Architects of the Philippines calls on government agencies, private institutions, and media outlets to respect and preserve the dignity of the profession by refraining from such misapplications of the term,” it said.



The statement drew mixed reactions from Filipinos, with some arguing that there are more pressing issues, such as the reported government corruption involving flood control projects.

“‘Words matter,' daw sabi ng UAP. True. Kaya when they chose to fight for a word, not against corruption, that spoke louder than anything else,” actor-content creator Chuckie Dreyfus wrote in a post.

“For the record: Merriam-Webster defines architect not just as the profession, but also as ‘a person who designs and guides a plan or undertaking,'” he added, citing a dictionary definition of the term “architect.”

“‘We architects build, we don't plunder.' Sana ‘yun na lang ang sinabi. Mas malinaw, mas makabuluhan, mas may paninindigan. Instead, lumabas tuloy na mas priority nila ang semantics kaysa sa accountability,” Chuckie continued.

“My dad was an architect. He'd laugh at this pa-woke fragility and say: corruption is the real insult, not vocabulary,” he concluded, sharing a screengrab of Merriam-Webster's definition of the word “architect.”



Some Filipinos also took to the comments to raise concerns about the UAP's perspective.

“Architect in the statement means orchestrator… Not literally the architect profession…” a Facebook user said.

“This is a little bit of an overreaction. No one in her [or] his right mind will ever interpret it the way you do. I mean, all you have to do is open a dictionary and see that ‘architect' is not just about the profession. Chill. There are bigger problems to solve and more hideous demons to slay,” another said.

“Rhetoric lang namn ‘yan, meaning, nag-isip ng isang bagay para ma-execute ang plano,” a different Pinoy commented.

“Aware ba kayo that you're actually embarrassing yourselves for this statement? May multiple meanings ang word na ‘architect,' both literal and figurative, just like author, engineer, doctor, or pilot. Not an exclusive property of one profession. An architect also means the creator [or] mastermind of a plan, project or system, good or bad,” another said.

“Doctor, a medical professional. Verb is to ‘doctor a document', that's to alter or falsify something,” the user added.

“The list goes on… Pwede naman kasi mag-check ng dictionary, no? Words evolve and carry metaphorical weight, and I don't think any society has authority to dictate or restrict how people use them outside licensing. ‘Yun lang,” the user continued.

Another lexicon, the Cambridge Dictionary, also carries two meanings for the word “architect.”

One is related to the profession, while the other is “a person responsible for achieving a particular plan or aim.”

Decades before Mark Sebastian Jordan wrote about the murderous and paranormal history of North Central Ohio, his convictions wrangled with discoveries he made every day.

“I was a skeptic,” the author said. “I very much kind of came at things from a scientific perspective.”

As a youngster, he thought he might grow up to be a paleontologist, volcanologist or some other scientist.

“I saw no provable scientific basis for ghosts, so I didn't really give it much thought,” Jordan said.

Now, 40 years of research later, he has so much evidence of hauntings throughout the region that he published them in a book called "In These Haunted Hills: Ghosts of the Ohio Highlands."

Jordan will debut the book 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sept. 27-28 during the Ohio Heritage Days at Malabar Farm State Park near Lucas.

The transition from doubter to devotee happened one day after college when Jordan clocked out for his lunch break.

“I was still living at home with my folks at this time, about halfway between Mansfield and Shelby,” he said. “That particular day, I was really tired because I was involved in a play production.”

He walked into the house and found his mother babysitting his young nephew. Exhausted, he sat down and turned on the television.

“I can hear the sound of Mom fiddling around with some pots and pans in the kitchen,” Jordan said. “Then I hear the sound of the baby toddling out of the kitchen and around the edge of the couch, and I feel a little tingle on the bottom of my chin in my beard like he's reached out his finger to touch me.”

Like a good uncle, he reached back to acknowledge the baby's playful advances.

“That's when I realized the baby's not there and the kitchen is dead quiet,” Jordan said. “Mom wasn't in there moving pots and pans around, and in fact, she had taken the baby and they went to take a nap.”

The experience forced him to reevaluate his worldview.

“That was the first point when I was confronted with the realization, ‘Oh, maybe there are things going on that I can't easily explain or dismiss,' and that was all it took,” Jordan said. “That opened the door – a crack – and ever since then, I've found that I really pick up on things like that.”

Searching for and recognizing new encounters became one of his favorite hobbies.

“It's almost like a radio thing,” Jordan said. “You have to open yourself up to tune into it, and it's very possible to tune it out.”

If the phenomena present themselves through frequencies, the region's lead investigator decided, then his own mind is the antenna. The best way to discover new programs would be to move around until he receives another clear signal.

“I've been all over the state and beyond doing ghost hunting,” Jordan said. “I think that a lot of the hauntings that are encountered by people are scientific phenomena that may yet someday be explained. They're elusive, difficult, tricky to capture.”

His work over 40 years has given him access to many locations abundant with paranormal activity and introduced him to perplexing stories from the region's history, and afforded him the time to research them to completion.

He is known throughout the Buckeye State as an author, playwright, columnist, newspaperman, music critic and folk artist.

Some of Jordan's most popular books include "The Ceely Rose Murders at Malabar Farm," "The Witch of Mansfield: The Tetched Life of Phebe Wise" and "Get Busy Living: Doing Time at Shawshank: Behind the Scenes on the World's Favorite Movie."

This summer, his publisher called and told him there would be a delay on publishing his eighth book, with his work not hitting stores until 2026.

“I understand, but I wanted to have something new for Heritage Days,” Jordan said. “I've been for the last few years trying to have out a new book every fall.”

The author's jovial smile faded as he recalled hearing the news. He took a sip of coffee with one hand, then lovingly patted his kitten, Lady Jane, with the other.

He decided in August that nothing would stop him from having a new book, so he called a second publisher and asked the absolute fastest they could edit and print his first run. The answer? Two weeks.

“I wrote the book in 13 days,” Jordan said with a glimmer in his eye. “That was 13 days of hammering.”

The new book is his ninth completed, but eighth published.

The book, "In These Haunted Hills: Ghosts of the Ohio Highlands," is a mixture of his own personal experiences, folklore from the region, eyewitness accounts he has collected and history he has researched.

“In a couple cases, I've been able to go and find the roots of stories that everyone just dismissed as folklore,” Jordan said.

The stories are from Richland, Ashland, Holmes, Coshocton, Knox and Crawford counties.

Some of the locations are famous, while others are offbeat.

“I have one chapter that is just specifically about hauntings in private residences throughout the region that I've experienced,” Jordan said.

He devoted a chapter to Brownella Cottage in Galion, a famous paranormally active house and museum.

Another section of the book is about the Ohio State Reformatory, the prison made famous by Stephen King as Shawshank State Penitentiary.

There's also a look at The Renaissance Theatre in downtown Mansfield.

“I had so much Malabar stuff that I divided that into three chapters,” Jordan said. “One is about the Big House, one is about the hostel and one is kind of miscellaneous about everything else, including the big barn.”

And some of the stories will be news to many readers, like the tale of Sarah's grave in a haunted cemetery near Greer that eventually became popular among high school students.

“Guys would take their dates and, hopefully, the dates would get scared and hug them a little closer,” Jordan said. “I dug through the detritus of time and found that there is a true story that whole situation arose from and there actually was a Sarah.”

The author hopes readers will appreciate learning more about the haunted hills of North Central Ohio.

“When I tell these stories, I do not claim to have all the answers,” Jordan said. “Anyone who tells you they do have the answers is trying to sell you something.”

Karoline Leavitt is determined to get to the bottom of Escalatorgate.

The White House Press Secretary is demanding answers about a malfunctioning escalator and teleprompter that stole the show during President Donald Trump's big speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday.

Trump, 79, and first lady Melania, 55, were forced to walk up the escalator at the UN Headquarters in New York after it stopped moving shortly after they stepped on. The teleprompter also stopped working as Trump took the podium, prompting the president to read his remarks from a printout.

Fox News host Jesse Watters, along with several other conservatives, decried the incidents as “sabotage.”

“Well, Jesse, that's definitely what it appears to be to me,” Leavitt told the host on Jesse Watters Primetime.

“First it was the escalator, then it was the teleprompter, and then Katie Pavlich from Townhall… noticed that the audio inside of the room was much lower and different for the president of the United States than the previous speaker,” she went on, arguing that “when you put all of this together, it doesn't look like a coincidence.”

Leavitt said the Secret Service was already looking into the matter.

“If we find that these were UN staffers who were purposefully trying to trip up—literally trip up—the president and the first lady of the United States. Well, there better be accountability for those people, and I will personally see to it,” she concluded.

Watters similarly branded the incident “an insurrection” and joked that “what we need to do is either leave the UN or we need to bomb it.”

Earlier in the day, Leavitt posted on X a portion of a story from The Sunday Times that read, “UN staff members have joked that they may turn off the escalators and elevators and simply tell [Trump] they ran out of money, so he has to walk up the stairs.”

If someone at the UN intentionally stopped the escalator as the President and First Lady were stepping on, they need to be fired and investigated immediately.The Times reported this on Sunday.👇 pic.twitter.com/NitsWbGYG0

But the answer might already be under the noses of Trump officials. 

A source told the Daily Beast that someone in the president's own entourage accidentally triggered the emergency stop.

The UN appeared to confirm as much in a statement clarifying that “a videographer from the U.S. delegation” stepped on the escalator ahead of Trump and Melania.

“A subsequent investigation, including a readout of the machine's central processing unit, indicated that the escalator had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step was triggered at the top of the escalator,” it said. “The videographer may have inadvertently triggered the safety function.”

The source also told the Daily Beast that delegations were allowed to bring their own laptops and teleprompter operators, and that the UN was not running it during Trump's speech. It was suggested that Trump's team did not arrive early enough to ensure their equipment was properly set up.

Trump made sure the world knew about the minor inconveniences he had to endure.

“These are the two things I got from the United Nations: a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter,” he said during his speech.

If you're a fan of classic sci-fi shows like The X-Files and The Twilight Zone and are looking for a book that can scratch that itch, Little Visitor & Other Abductions may be just what the doctor ordered. This graphic novel brings together three of cartoonist Adam Szym's alien abduction tales - "A Cordial Invitation," "Little Visitor," and "Frolicker" - into one creepy package.

With Little Visitor & Other Abductions in stores now, IGN can exclusively debut a new preview of "A Cordial Invitation." Check it out in the slideshow gallery below:

Little Visitor & Other Abductions is written and drawn by Szym. The book is published by Oni Press and distributed by Simon & Schuster. Here's the official description of the book:

The cast and crew of an obscure film recount a tragedy that occurred during its doomed production. A young girl searches for her father in the darkness of the desert and stumbles upon an otherworldly cocktail party. Two strangers nurture violent thoughts in a bitter, lonely child as his village's harvest festival nears. Connecting these three stories is one horrific theme . . .

From cartoonist and illustrator Adam Szym comes a triptych of otherworldly science fiction horror stories about alien abduction and the negligence and malice that allows it to happen. Including the Ignatz Award–nominated A Cordial Invitation, Little Visitor, and a brand-new tale—Frolicker—this uncanny trilogy of graphic novellas is perfect for fans of The Twilight Zone, The X-Files, and all things beyond our understanding.

Little Visitor & Other Abductions is available in bookstores and comic shops now. You can order a copy on Amazon.
