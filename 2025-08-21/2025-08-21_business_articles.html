                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store plummeted roughly 10% on Thursday after the restaurant unveiled its new logo earlier this week as part of a larger brand refresh. The phrase "old country store" has also been removed. Under that mission, Cracker Barrel's brand refresh includes updates to visual elements, restaurant spaces and food and retail offerings. Cracker Barrel said in March that the refresh will still maintain the brand's "rich history of country hospitality" and "authentic charm that has made the brand a beloved destination for generations of families." "We believe in the goodness of country hospitality, a spirit that has always defined us. Our values haven't changed," Chief Marketing Officer Sarah Moore said in a media release. However, many social media users have criticized the new logo, especially those in conservative circles. The president's son, Donald Trump Jr., amplified a post on Wednesday suggesting that the logo change was led by CEO Julie Felss Masino to erase the American tradition aspect of the branding and make it more general, as a way of leaning into diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Conservative activist Robby Starbuck added his commentary on Thursday, writing in a post on social media site X, "Good morning @CrackerBarrel! You're about to learn that wokeness really doesn't pay." The company has a relatively small market cap of about $1.2 billion compared with other restaurant chains. Customers have also complained on social media about the interior redesign of many Cracker Barrel restaurants, saying the new decor favors a more sterile and modern style over its tried-and-true country feel. On the restaurant's latest earnings call in June, Masino said Cracker Barrel had completed 20 remodels and 20 refreshes. "Employees had given us great feedback about working in those newly remodeled and refreshed stores and guests continue to tell us that they're lighter, brighter, more welcoming and they're enjoying them," Masino said on the call. Cracker Barrel is not the only stock to see large swings based on political social media posts. Earlier this month, shares of American Eagle soared after Trump posted that an ad featuring Sydney Sweeney, which faced significant social media pushback from the left, was "the 'HOTTEST' ad out there." Back in 2023, Anheuser-Busch InBev faced heavy criticism from conservatives after a collaboration between Bud Light and social influencer Dylan Mulvaney, who is transgender.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HOLLY SPRINGS, N.C. â€” A hallway as long as three football fields connects four buildings at Fujifilm Biotechnologies' new biologics manufacturing plant in Holly Springs, North Carolina. The first two buildings are preparing to open this fall to produce drug substance, essentially the base of biologic drugs, for Fujifilm's initial customers Regeneron and Johnson & Johnson. The second two facilities are still under construction, with plans to open in 2028. But the plans for this complex were underway well before Trump proposed higher duties. It's taken five years and more than $3 billion to turn the idea into reality. And it shows how difficult it would be for drugmakers to quickly increase production in the U.S., even with a possible grace period that Trump has floated. "This is a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility, so everything needs to be safe to put into patients," said Fujifilm Biotechnologies CEO Lars Petersen. Fujifilm's timeline for opening the Holly Springs site is in line with the industry average of between three and five years to start up a new plant, depending on the complexity, according to Gabriela de Almeida, managing director and partner at Boston Consulting Group. The company decided to start replicating its plants to speed up the process of designing and building them. The more Fujifilm does that, the faster it can open new sites and customers can start production there, Petersen said. Biologics are particularly complex drugs to make because they rely on living cells to produce the exact same thing, every single time, said Regeneron CEO Len Schleifer. When all four buildings are open in 2028, the plant should have the capacity to produce 50 million doses of medicine a year with 16 bioreactors that can each hold 20,000 liters. The companies won't say exactly which drugs will be made at the facility, but it is designed to produce monoclonal antibodies. It takes almost two months to produce one batch of bulk drug substance. Opening a valve at the wrong time and letting just one wrong molecule inside could mean an entire batch is lost, Fujifilm's Petersen said. Regeneron, one of the largest producers of biologic drugs in the world, signed a $3 billion, 10-year contract with Fujifilm for space at the new Holly Springs site, doubling its U.S. manufacturing capacity. By the time Regeneron was looking to increase production, Fujifilm had a head start of multiple years in constructing the facility, so it made sense for the biotech company to secure space there instead of building from scratch, Schleifer said. Regeneron declined to specify which drugs it will produce in Holly Springs. The company manufactures its medicines at a mix of locations, including its own factories in the U.S. and Ireland, according to regulatory filings. Drugmakers were already ramping up their U.S. manufacturing capabilities before Trump started threatening tariffs specifically on pharmaceuticals, which he exempted from sweeping levies on dozens of countries this spring. Johnson & Johnson Chief Financial Officer Joe Wolk said changes in U.S. tax policy made the United States a more attractive place to produce drugs. Those moves will allow J&J to supply all of its advanced medicines from the U.S., Wolk said, while declining to name which drugs will be made at Fujifilm's facility. "It really comes down to good tax policy," Wolk said. Life sciences companies have announced about $28 billion of investments in the state since 2016, with a record $10.8 billion pledged last year, according to the North Carolina Biotechnology Center. Down the street from Fujifilm's new facility in Holly Springs, Amgen is building a $1 billion drug substance manufacturing plant, following another it opened there in January. Genentech will break ground later this month on a $700 million fill-finish facility, where injectable drugs are packaged into containers like vials. "It's talent," said Laura Rowley, vice president of life science economic development at the North Carolina Biotechnology Center, about what's driving companies to the state. "It is being here amongst their peers, where there is opportunity still for companies to shine, because we do have that spirit of working together." Biopharma companies are moving to the U.S. to make innovative products with high margins that can withstand the higher cost, BCG's Almeida said. Only 18% of finished generic and branded drugs originate in the U.S., excluding Puerto Rico, according to an analysis of 2024 Food and Drug Administration pharmaceutical import data by the U.S. Pharmacopeia, an organization that aims to improve the drug supply chain. For branded injectable medicines â€“ like the ones that will be made at Fujifilm's Holly Springs facility â€“ Europe is the dominant source, with almost half originating there. Securing manufacturing capacity in the U.S. with a contractor like Fujifilm is one tweak companies can make to reduce their potential tariff exposure in the short term, said Greg Graves, a senior partner in McKinsey's life sciences practice. Signing on with an external site could be quicker and less expensive than building a new plant. Called a tech transfer, the process of producing a drug in a new location requires planning, testing to prove the new process works the same, then seeking approval from regulators. Graves and fellow McKinsey senior partner Parag Patel are seeing the same among their clients. However, they said, no one is preparing for a rate as high as 250%, a possibility Trump raised earlier this month. "I haven't come across any organization that's going that big in their planning because I think they all understand that if this happens, it would fundamentally change the way we're organized and running, and therefore we'd have to have a different conversation," Patel said. At Fujifilm's Holly Springs site, the whole point is to give customers flexibility, Petersen said. Should Fujifilm decide to move forward, Petersen thinks it can build that in just three years this time, since the company's getting faster with each facility clone it creates. "There's no question that when you have these discussions like tariffs or like Covid or like any other disruption to the supply chain, it creates a need for flexibility," Petersen said. "This facility was built before some of these discussions, but it's definitely built to handle supply chain ability should demand go up or down."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two top House Democrats are investigating whether Paramount and Skydance Media acquiesced to "illegitimate demands" from President Donald Trump in order to win approval for their $8 billion merger. "Two wrongs do not make a right," Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Frank Pallone of New Jersey wrote to David Ellison, CEO of the newly formed Paramount Skydance Corporation, in a letter obtained by CNBC. The FCC blessed the merger in late July, less than a month after Paramount agreed to a $16 million settlement to end Trump's lawsuit against its subsidiary CBS News over a snippet of a "60 Minutes" interview. The president had claimed the interview was deceptively edited to boost his then-campaign rival, Kamala Harris. The lawsuit was widely criticized as meritless, including by Paramount, which maintained that the show followed a standard editing process. "For both Paramount and Skydance to acquiesce to President Trump's meritless claims in order to consummate the merger demonstrates an extreme disregard to anything that might stand in the way of profit," they wrote. Paramount Skydance did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the letter. The letter, dated Wednesday, gives Paramount two weeks to answer questions and provide a slew of internal materials, including "all related communications involving" Trump, the White House, the FCC and the Trump Organization. The lawmakers suggest that Paramount and Skydance, through their dealings with Trump, have violated anti-bribery and corruption clauses in the agreements they filed with the FCC. Raskin and Pallone also noted that Trump, while boasting about the settlement, claimed he also expects to get another $20 million in "Advertising, PSAs, or similar Programming" from the "new Owners." News outlets have reported that Skydance sources deny Trump's assertion. The reported "side deal" with Trump "was necessarily contingent on the FCC approving the deal and does not appear to present any legitimate value to the public, only to President Trump," they wrote. "Therefore, this appears to be an offer of payment and benefits to a government official designed to achieve a specific outcome from the governmentâ€”in other words, a bribe," the letter reads. Raskin and Pallone also point to CBS' recent cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," the tentpole talk show whose host, a vocal Trump critic, called Paramount's settlement a "big fat bribe." And they note reporting that Skydance "agreed to make changes to CBS and its editorial practices that align with the Trump Administration's political agenda" as a condition of the merger. That includes hiring an ombudsman "to police the news organization's editorial choices," which the lawmakers called "a poorly disguised attempt at censoring speech that contradicts the Administration's ideals."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A New York state appeals court on Thursday tossed out a massive monetary fine for civil business fraud imposed on President Donald Trump, his company, and other defendants related to a lawsuit by state Attorney General Letitia James. The appeals court said the eye-popping penalty â€” which rose to more than $500 million since it was imposed in early 2024 â€” violates the U.S Constitution's Eighth Amendment, which prohibits "excessive fines." But the court in the same ruling upheld Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron's finding that Trump and the others committed business fraud by overstating the value of real estate assets owned by the Trump Organization to boost Trump's purported net worth. Those actions helped the company get better loan terms and other financial benefits. The ruling Thursday also upheld nonmonetary sanctions imposed by Engoron on the defendants, saying they were "well crafted to curb defendants' business culture." The ruling, which came 11 months after oral arguments in the case, was split several ways, with one judge, David Friedman, saying he would have dismissed James' lawsuit outright. In a concurring opinion on the fine being voided, Judge Peter Moulton wrote, "While harm certainly occurred, it was not the cataclysmic harm that can justify a nearly half-billion-dollar award to the state." "Indeed, the calculation of the disgorgement in this case was far from a reasonable approximation," Moulton wrote. Trump crowed about the ruling in a post on Truth Social. "TOTAL VICTORY in the FAKE New York State Attorney General Letitia James Case!" "Others were afraid to do business there. The amount, including Interest and Penalties, was over $550 Million Dollars. It was a Political Witch Hunt, in a business sense, the likes of which no one has ever seen before." After 5 years of hell, justice prevailed!" Both Donald Trump Jr. and the company were defendants as well. James, in her statement saying she would ask the New York Court of Appeals to restore the fine, also said, "The First Department today affirmed the well-supported finding of the trial court: Donald Trump, his company, and two of his children are liable for fraud." "The court upheld the injunctive relief we won, limiting Donald Trump and the Trump Organization officers' ability to do business in New York," James said. "It should not be lost to history: yet another court has ruled that the president violated the law, and that our case has merit." The trial judge, Engoron, in February 2024 ordered Trump to pay around $454 million in total penalties after holding him liable for business fraud. Engoron found that Trump's statements of financial condition, signed between 2014 and 2021, overvalued his assets from between $812 million and $2.2 billion. With interest, the penalty imposed on Trump and other defendants in the case has grown to more than $500 million. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's Tesla is facing a federal probe by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration after the U.S. auto safety agency found that the company was not reporting crashes as required. According to documents posted to NHTSA's website on Thursday, the agency's Office of Defects Investigation had "identified numerous incident reports" from Tesla concerning crashes that had "occurred several months or more before the dates of the reports" to the agency. The delayed reports were likely "due to an issue with Tesla's data collection, which, according to Tesla, has now been fixed," according to NHTSA's explanation for the probe. Automakers must report on collisions that occurred on publicly accessible roads in the U.S. that involved the use of either partially or fully automated driving systems in their cars within five days of the companies becoming aware of any crash. NHTSA will also investigate whether Tesla neglected to report any prior relevant collisions, and whether its reports submitted to the safety regulator "include all of the required and available data." The company sells electric vehicles equipped with a standard Autopilot system, or premium Full Self-Driving Supervised option, which is also known as FSD, in the U.S. A site that tracks Tesla-involved collisions drawing on news reports, police records and federal data, TeslaDeaths.com, has found at least 59 fatalities resulting from crashes where Tesla Autopilot or FSD were a factor. The new NHTSA probe comes as Musk, Tesla's CEO, is trying to persuade investors that the company can become a global leader in autonomous vehicles, and that its self-driving systems are safe enough to operate fleets of robotaxis on public roads in the U.S. Riders can book trips via the company's Tesla Robotaxi app. Tesla has not begun driverless ride-hailing operations that would make it directly comparable to Alphabet-owned Waymo, or Baidu's Apollo Go and other autonomous vehicle competitors yet. The company is facing a sales and profit decline, due, in part, to a consumer backlash against Musk's incendiary political rhetoric, his work to re-elect President Donald Trump, and his work leading the Department of Government Efficiency to slash federal spending and its workforce. Still, many Wall Street analysts and shareholders remain optimistic about Musk's vision. "We think it is a positive that Tesla has begun robotaxi operations which puts it on the path to addressing a large market (we estimate that the US robotaxi market will be $7 bn in 2030 as discussed in our recent AV deep dive report)," Goldman Sachs autos industry analysts wrote in a note Wednesday. Musk and Tesla have not given investors a sense of what they expect in terms of Robotaxi-related revenue or the technical performance of vehicles in its rideshare fleet, so a "debate on the pace of robotaxi growth will continue," the research note said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As students head back to school this fall, many parents feel the urge to do more â€” to book the tutor, add the extra math lesson, or squeeze in one more after-school activity "just in case." The impulse comes from love and wanting our kids to have opportunities. But somewhere along the way, opportunity can turn into pressure. During my six years of researching hundreds of high-achieving kids, I've found that the real engine behind long-term success is believing that your worth comes from your inherent value and your ability to make a positive impact on the world. DON'T MISS: How to Build a Standout Personal Brand: Online, In Person, and At Work Many young people today are motivated by the fear that if they fall short, they will be less loved or accepted, as if their value hinges on their performance. In 2021, I partnered with a Baylor University researcher to investigate the impact of achievement culture among young adults. Our survey â€” which was published in my book "Never Enough" â€” of nearly 500 students revealed a sobering finding: More than half believed their parents' love fluctuated based on their performance. Psychologists call this "conditional regard," or parental affection that depends on a child meeting certain expectations, whether academic, athletic, or behavioral. Children raised on conditional regard can become so afraid of mistakes that even minor setbacks can rattle their sense of self. It can erode self-worth, accelerate burnout, and leave them feeling purposeless once the accolades stop coming or vulnerable to depression when they experience setbacks. We have to help our kids build a mattering mindset from the start. The more we understand their quirks and talents, the more they feel seen for their unique selves. When your child fails â€” gets cut from the team, bombs a test â€” remind them their value isn't up for debate. One mother I interviewed uses this exercise: She holds up a $20 bill. If they aren't thriving, take a step back and ask why. When we express anger over a child's performance, it can break the parent-child connection. Curiosity preserves your relationship, and is a gateway to clean fuel. Let them know when their actions make a difference. Whether it's comforting a sibling, brightening a friend's day, or coming up with a clever solution, take the time to remind them that their value goes far beyond their achievements. At least once a day, show warmth and affection regardless of performance. Let them know they are just as cherished on a bad day as on a good one. If I could offer one piece of advice to parents this fall, it would be to worry less about the grades and more about the mindset you're helping cultivate in your child â€” the one that fuels lifelong achievement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Google made a big splash with its Pixel 10 series of smartphones, it was the software features that were strategically important for the tech giant's bid to compete with players like OpenAI and Perplexity in consumer AI. As it introduced its latest devices on Wednesday, Alphabet-owned Google showed off a slew of artificial intelligence features that are powered by the firm's Gemini AI models. "Camera Coach" can give users tips on how to adjust framing and other aspects of a picture for the perfect shot. Live translation for phone calls is also available. All of this gives a glimpse into the so-called "agentic AI" future that tech giants are hoping to reach, where super-smart AI assistants can carry out complex tasks. It is a pivotal time for Google to come up with answers, as fears mount that users and revenue from its core search product could be eroded as more people turn to rivals like Perplexity and OpenAI's ChatGPT. Before Google lies a unique opportunity â€” the company develops Android, the operating system that is installed across more than three billion devices globally, many of which are smartphones. "The company is leapfrogging rivals like OpenAI and DeepSeek by leveraging its access to billions of Android users, enabling a more effective distribution, integration, and a wider range of use cases for Gemini at scale," Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC. But Google's aim with its smartphones is to show off the best that Android has to offer in terms of software and AI. At that point, Android licensers, which include the likes of Samsung and Xiaomi, may adopt some of those features on their new handsets. This cycle would in turn spread Google's Gemini and AI tools to more users. "This massive user base creates a "flywheel effect" of adoption, usage, and feedback, further solidifying Gemini's position as a master agent on the most widely used device on the planetâ€”the smartphone," Shah said. The timing is also advantageous because of struggles at rival Apple. The Cupertino giant's lack of AI strategy has concerned investors, with the iPhone showing very few features compared to Google's offerings. When Apple gets AI right it will be a fantastic experience. But right now, Google and all Android licensees have a window of opportunity," Wood said. Yet while there is now a land grab for users between major AI players, questions still linger over how Google will eventually monetize its AI services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After weeks of heated negotiation, Brussels and Washington finally arrived at a trade agreement late last month, setting out 15% blanket tariffs on EU exports to the U.S. Several questions remained unanswered including on what tariff rate would apply to some goods U.S. President Donald Trump has hit with sectoral duties. Thursday's announcement at last shed more details at a time when many other trading partners are still waiting, and negotiating, for similar clarity on their respective trade deals with the U.S. This framework is the first step, one that can grow over time to cover more sectors, improve market access and strengthen our economic ties even further," he added. As of Sept. 1, the U.S. will apply only MFN duties on several goods from the EU, including "unavailable natural resources (including cork), all aircraft and aircraft parts, generic pharmaceuticals and their ingredients and chemical precursors." Several so-called Section 232 tariffs have been capped at the wider 15% tariff rate, including those on lumber, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, according to a senior U.S. administration official. Meanwhile, the statement noted that the EU intends to "to eliminate tariffs on all U.S. industrial goods and to provide preferential market access for a wide range of U.S. seafood and agricultural goods." This was already broadly covered in the initial framework. The statement also included insights into the EU's energy purchasing and investment pledges, which previously raised questions about their feasibility and about potential repercussions if the commitments do not materialize. The latest announcement reiterated figures for planned spending from the EU, including on artificial intelligence chips, energy and broader investments in the U.S., but described them as intended and expected, rather than as guaranteed commitments, a senior administration official pointed out. Thursday's statement also noted plans for the EU to "substantially" increase its procurement of U.S. military and defense equipment, even as Europe has committed to growing its own defense capabilities. Notably, the latest agreement does not introduce changes in terms of the EU's Digital Services Act, which includes regulations for big tech companies and has long been a point of contention in trade talks for Trump. Sefcovic on Thursday noted that the digital sector had been kept out of trade talks. The EU's trade commissioner suggested that, while it would not be easy to come to an agreement on this issue with Washington, "these doors are not closed forever." Europe's pharmaceutical sector â€” the U.S.' top source for pharma imports â€” will also see tariffs capped at up to 15%. Critically, the rate will not stack on top of other EU-wide tariffs. From Sept. 1, the Trump administration has also agreed to only apply its MFN drug pricing policy to generic pharmaceuticals. The directive aims to reduce U.S. drug prices by tying them to the typically lower prices paid by other developed nations. Back in April, the Trump administration had launched a so-called Section 232 investigation on pharmaceutical products to examine the impact of imports on national security. In recent weeks, Trump threatened levies as high as 250% on the pharma sector and sent an ultimatum to major firms demanding that they lower U.S. drug prices. The White House leader has long lambasted the sector over what he has dubbed "abusive" pricing practices, while simultaneously urging firms to move their manufacturing operations stateside in an effort to bolster domestic production. That prompted a flurry of U.S. investment commitments over recent months, including from Novartis, AstraZeneca and Roche, as well as pricing adjustments from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. The U.S. and EU on Thursday said they had agreed to a conditional 15% tariff for European autos and auto parts bound for the U.S. â€” but only after Brussels introduces legislation to reduce their industrial duties, according to a senior administration official. "With respect to automobiles, the United States and the European Union intend to accept and provide mutual recognition to each other's standards," the U.S. and EU said in a joint statement published Thursday. Speaking late last month, Trump had hailed the initially disclosed framework agreement as the biggest trade deal ever made and one that promised to be "great for cars." The prospect of a 15% tariff rate on autos and auto parts represents a substantial reduction from the U.S. president's threat to impose charges of 30%. It also nearly halves the existing tariff rate on Europe's auto sector from 27.5%. The German Association of the Automotive Industry, or VDA, which represents more than 620 companies involved in the German auto sector, warned a U.S. tariff of 15% on auto products would "cost German automotive companies billions annually and place a burden on them in the midst of their transformation."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Starbucks will expand its test of coconut water beverages to hundreds of more stores, as it leans further into health and wellness. Starting Thursday, the coffee giant will test its Coco Matcha and Coco Cold Brew drinks in more than 400 stores across major cities including New York, Los Angeles and the greater Chicago area. Starbucks first tested the coconut beverages in New York City as a part of its "Starting Five" innovation program, in which it tests out new ideas in five coffeehouses and seeks feedback from its baristas and customers before pushing those ideas into additional stores. Starbucks did not share plans for further expansion beyond the regional test this month. Expanding the test of our Coco Matcha and Coco Cold Brew beverages is the next step to accelerate our health and wellness beverage innovation plan," Dana Pellicano, senior vice president of Starbucks global product experience, said in a statement to CNBC. "We are incorporating real-time feedback with a focus on transparency, functionality, and evolving consumer needs." Cold foam has become one of the chain's most popular modifiers, as it grew 23% year over year, CEO Brian Niccol told analysts on its most recent earnings call. Starbucks will launch protein cold foam late in the fourth quarter, part of its push to kick-start sales after a stretch of financial results that has disappointed Wall Street. "Protein cold foam with no added sugar is an easy way to add 15 grams of protein to virtually any cold beverage. And customers can also add the flavor of their choice," Niccol told analysts. The expanded Starbucks test is part of a larger trend of top restaurant chains increasing beverage options, driven in part by younger consumers who crave customized cold drinks and healthier options. Offerings such as specialty coffees and energy drinks have seen the most growth on menus over the past two years, as hot coffee and tea beverages on menus decline, the market researcher reported. Starbucks is in the middle of its "Back to Starbucks" turnaround plans under Niccol, featuring more cafe renovations and menu changes. Niccol told analysts customer value perceptions were near two-year highs in its most recent quarter, driven by gains among Gen Z and millennials, who make up over half its customer base. Starbucks is betting that innovation, coupled with better experiences under its new "Green Apron Service" strategy, will help to boost business. While Starbucks also posted better-than-expected U.S. sales last quarter, they still fell 2% from the prior-year period. Starbucks shares have fallen just more than 1% this year. In addition to the New York, Los Angeles and Chicago areas, Starbucks will also test the coconut water drinks in select cities in the Midwest including Cedar Rapids, Iowa; St. Louis, Missouri; Springfield, Illinois; South Bend, Indiana; and Madison and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Treasury yields climbed higher as investors look ahead to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech at the Fed's annual economic symposium on Friday. The 10-year Treasury yield rose over 3 basis points to 4.328%. The 2-year yield was nearly 5 basis points higher at 3.79%. Investors are keeping an eye on the Fed's annual meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where central bankers are gathered to make decisions on future monetary policy. Powell is set to give a speech on Friday at the meeting, which could offer some insights into the path of interest rates. Traders are pricing in nearly an 80% chance of the central bank cutting interest rates at its next policy meeting in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. The FOMC minutes, released on Wednesday, showed that the Fed was concerned about both inflation and the labor market and felt it was too soon to cut interest rates. Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman dissented with the decision to keep rates steady, the first time two board members have done so since 1993. "The Fed is worried about inflation accelerating as companies pass tariffs on to consumers," said David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation. "The minutes are consistent with Powell's hawkish comments last meeting. The bulls might get some cold water splashed in their faces at Jackson Hole."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taken from CNBC's Daily Open, our international markets newsletter â€” Subscribe today If you have any U.S. technology stocks in your portfolio (and let's face it, who doesn't? Palantir â€” the standout S&P 500 stock, having more than doubled so far this year â€” had its sixth consecutive day in the red and lost its place among a ranking of the 20 most valuable U.S. companies. While Palantir's slide was partly triggered by a report from short seller Andrew Left's Citron Research, which called the company "detached from fundamentals and analysis," there was no single trigger for the broader pullback. Investors could have been spooked by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's caution about an AI bubble forming, although some analysts dispute that assertion. "In our view the tech bull cycle will be well intact at least for another 2-3 years," said Wall Street tech bull Dan Ives. Or it could be something benign, like traders locking in profits. "Tech stocks," said Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth, "have had an incredibly strong run â€“ with some up over 80% since the early April lows." Some investors might have just wanted to cash out for another round of margaritas. Fed officials divided over inflation and employment worries. Central bank governors generally agreed there were risks on both sides. No new solar or wind power projects, Trump says. Renewable energy projects will no longer receive approval, Trump posted Wednesday on Truth Social. His comment comes after the administration already tightened federal permitting last month. The tech giant had in recent months been splashing out eye-watering amounts of money â€” up to $100 million on signing bonuses â€” to poach AI employees at other firms. But it appears that cash pool's left to dry for now. Technology stocks declined on Wednesday, with Palantir having its sixth straight losing day. [PRO] The Fed is expected to cut just as markets trade at highs. U.S. President Donald Trump is pursuing an unusual strategy â€” courting Russian President Vladimir Putin, holding fire on Beijing, all the while turning the screws on India. Despite India being one of the earliest nations to engage in negotiations with the Trump administration, there is still no sign of it sealing a deal with America. New Delhi is now also staring at a secondary tariff of 25% or a "penalty" for its purchases of Russian oil that is set to come into effect later this month.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed 0.04% lower, snapping a three-session winning run. In an agreement reached last month, the EU said it would spend $750 billion on U.S. energy and invest a minimum of $600 billion in the United States â€” in exchange, blanket tariffs on its goods were set at 15% instead of the 30% rate threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump. However, in-depth details on how certain European industries would be impacted by the agreement were not revealed until Thursday. The immediate reaction among pharma stocks listed in Europe was somewhat muted, though the Stoxx Europe Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology index eventually closed 0.56% higher. Top performers in the sector included Danish allergy specialist ALK, up 5%, biotech firm Abivax, up 6%, and Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk, which gained 3%. It was also confirmed on Thursday that the EU's autos sector will be subject to 15% tariffs. However, officials revealed that this tariff rate â€” almost half the current rate â€” would only come into effect after Brussels introduced legislation to lower its industrial duties. Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC on Thursday that autos stocks could soon respond more notably to the trade agreement. "Stocks haven't responded as expected to greater clarity from this trade deal," he said. "This could be due to the level of market noise we are seeing. There is a lot happening in markets, but this news is a positive and should gradually get priced in once the markets' attention shifts." Looking at individual stocks, British retailer WH Smith plummeted 42% after the company revised its guidance for North America. Ahead of the end of its fiscal year, WH Smith said it had identified a Â£30 million ($40.35 million) "overstatement" of anticipated headline trading profit in its North America branch. "WHSmith now expects Headline trading profit from the North America division for the financial year ending 31 August 2025 to be approximately Â£25m, down from previous market expectations of approximately Â£55m," the company said in a statement on Thursday morning. Meanwhile, shares of ticketing giant CTS Eventim tumbled 17% on Thursday. The company reported record first-half revenue, but said its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) fell 8.9% year-on-year in the second quarter of the year. The company's live entertainment segment meanwhile reported a 39.7% drop in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter. â€” CNBC's Sam Meredith, Sophie Kiderlin and Karen Gilchrist contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Walmart on Thursday raised its full-year earnings and sales outlook as its online business posted another quarter of double-digit gains, even as the company said costs are rising from higher tariffs. The big-box retailer topped Wall Street's quarterly sales estimates but fell short of earnings expectations, the first time it missed on quarterly earnings since May 2022. The company said it felt pressure on profits for the period, including from some one-time expenses, such as restructuring costs, pricier insurance claims and litigation settlements. Walmart said it now expects net sales to grow between 3.75% and 4.75% for the fiscal year, up from its previous expectations for 3% to 4%. In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said the company is working hard to keep prices low â€“ including speeding up imports from overseas and stepping up the number of Rollbacks, or limited-time discounts, in its stores. "This is managed on an item-by-item and category-by-category basis," he said. "There are certainly areas where we have fully absorbed the impact of higher tariff costs. There are other areas where we've had to pass some of those costs along." But he added "tariff-impacted costs are continuing to drift upwards." Even so, Rainey said Walmart hasn't seen a change in customer spending. For example, sales of private-label items, which typically cost less than national brands, were roughly flat year over year, he said. "Everyone is looking to see if there are any creaks in the armor or anything that's happening with the consumer, but it's been very consistent," he said. Yet on the company's earnings call, CEO Doug McMillon said middle- and lower-income households have been more sensitive to tariff-related price increases, particularly in discretionary categories. "We see a corresponding moderation in units at the item level as customers switch to other items, or in some cases, categories," he said. Here's what the big-box retailer reported for the fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG: Walmart's net income jumped to $7.03 billion, or 88 cents per share, in the three-month period that ended July 31, compared with $4.50 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, including legal charges, Walmart reported adjusted earnings per share of 68 cents. Revenue rose from $169.34 billion in the year-ago quarter. At Sam's Club, comparable sales jumped 5.9% excluding fuel, higher than the 5.2% that analysts anticipated. In the U.S., Walmart said sales through store-fulfilled delivery of groceries and other items grew nearly 50% year over year, with one-third of those orders expedited. The company charges a fee for some of those faster deliveries, and others are included as a benefit of its subscription-based membership program, Walmart+. As Walmart's online business drums up more revenue from home deliveries, advertising and commissions from sellers on its third-party marketplace, e-commerce has become a profitable business. The company marked a milestone in May â€” posting its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business in the U.S. and globally. As higher duties have come in fits and starts â€” with some getting delayed and others going into effect earlier this month â€” Wall Street has tried to understand how those costs will ripple through the U.S. economy. Walmart warned in May that it would have to raise some prices due to higher levies on imports, even with its size and scale. About a third of what Walmart sells in the U.S. comes from other parts of the world, with China, Mexico, Canada, Vietnam and India representing its largest markets for imports, Rainey said in May. According to an analysis by CNBC of about 50 items sold by the retailer, some of those price changes have already hit shelves. Rainey on Thursday declined to specify items or categories where Walmart had increased prices, saying the company is "trying to keep prices as low as we can." He said one of the company's strategies has been bringing in inventory early, particularly for Sam's Club as it gets ready for the second half of the fiscal year and its crucial holiday season. Yet even with higher costs from tariffs, Walmart has fared better than its retail competitors as it has leaned into its reputation for value, competed on faster deliveries to customers' homes and attracted more business from higher-income households. The Arkansas-based retailer's performance has diverged sharply from rival Target, which posted another quarter of sales declines on Wednesday and named the new CEO who will be tasked with trying to turn around the company. It has followed the Target playbook by launching more exclusive and trend-driven brands, including grocery brand BetterGoods and activewear brand Love & Sports. It has also expanded its third-party marketplace to include prestige beauty brands and more. Sales of general merchandise, items outside of the grocery department, were a bright spot for Walmart in the fiscal second quarter, Rainey said. That category struggled during peak inflation in recent years, as consumers spent less on discretionary items because of rising grocery bills. Comparable sales for general merchandise rose by a low single-digit percentage and accelerated throughout the quarter, Rainey told CNBC. He added clothing and fashion sales "really shined for us."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk was ordered on Wednesday by a federal judge to face a lawsuit by voters accusing the world's richest person of defrauding them into signing a petition to support the U.S. Constitution for a chance to win his $1 million-a-day giveaway. U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman in Austin, Texas, said Jacqueline McAferty plausibly alleged in her proposed class action that Musk and his political action committee America PAC wrongly induced her to provide personal identifying information as part of the giveaway, late in the 2024 election campaign. Musk founded America PAC to support Republican Donald Trump's successful 2024 presidential run. McAferty, an Arizona resident, said Musk and America PAC induced voters in seven battleground states to sign his petition by promising that $1 million recipients would be chosen randomly, as in a lottery, though the voters had no real chance to collect. She said voters who signed were also required to provide names, addresses, email addresses and phone numbers. In seeking a dismissal, Musk listed several "red flags" as proof he had not run an illegal lottery. "It is plausible that plaintiff justifiably relied on those statements to believe that defendants were objectively offering her the chance to enter a random lottery--even if that is not what they subjectively intended to do," Pitman wrote. Musk had also rejected the suggestion that petition signers suffered harm by providing contact information. Pitman said an expert in political data brokerage could testify what that information was worth for voters in battleground states. The lawsuit was filed on Election Day, Nov. 5, 2024. A day earlier, a Philadelphia judge refused to end Musk's giveaway, saying that the city's top prosecutor failed to show it was an illegal lottery. Musk is a Texas resident, and his electric car company, Tesla, is based in Austin. We want to hear from you. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>
