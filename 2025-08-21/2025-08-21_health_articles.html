                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new international study led by researchers at Moffitt Cancer Center, the Karolinska Institutet and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center has uncovered a surprising mechanism of resistance to immunotherapy: cancer's ability to injure nearby nerves. The study, published in Nature, shows that when cancer cells infiltrate and damage tumor-associated nerves, it triggers an inflammatory response that ultimately weakens the effectiveness of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Our findings demonstrate that cancer-induced nerve injury is not just a bystander effect, it directly shapes the immune environment in ways that allow tumors to evade treatment. Using patient samples including those from recent neoadjuvant therapy trials and preclinical models of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer, the team showed that cancer cells degrade the protective myelin sheath of nearby nerves. The injured neurons release inflammatory signals, including IL-6 and type 1 interferons, which is able to be repaired initially, but over time creates a chronically suppressive tumor microenvironment. Resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy was overcome by removing nerves that transmit pain, blocking key neuronal injury signals, or combining anti-PD-1 with drugs that target the IL-6 pathway. "This work highlights a new role for the nervous system in cancer progression and resistance to therapy," Tsai said. The discovery could lead to new treatment combinations that improve outcomes for patients whose tumors invade and grow along nerves, a common feature in several cancer types associated with poor prognosis. "This is an example of how studying the cross talk between cancer, nerves and the immune system can reveal entirely new actionable vulnerabilities," Tsai said. Baruch, E. N., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new publication highlights the success of an international partnership working to strengthen nursing and midwifery in the Caribbean. "Fostering International Collaborations to Inform Nursing and Midwifery Policy: A Caribbean Initiative," appears in the International Nursing Review. It was led by Penn Nursing's Eileen T. Lake, PhD, RN, FAAN, the Edith Clemmer Steinbright Professor in Gerontology, with Carmen Alvarez, PhD, CRNP, CNM, FAAN, Associate Professor of Nursing, serving as co-author. The Caribbean faces significant challenges in this area, including high rates of migration and critical workforce shortages. Key structures, displayed in the colorful Figure 2, included the Pan American Collaborating Centers for Nursing and Midwifery (PANMCC) network, formal leadership, and support from PAHO. The process involved regular communication, stakeholder engagement, and a collaborative approach to survey design. The collaboration led to the successful creation and implementation of a comprehensive survey to 20 Caribbean countries, which resulted in a 100% response rate from the country Chief Nursing Officers and a 60% response rate from directors of higher education. "The paper's findings demonstrate the potential for coordinated efforts to inform nursing and midwifery human resources for health policy and practice in regions with limited resources," said Lake, who also serves as Associate Director of Penn Nursing's Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research. Lake and Alvarez represent Penn Nursing's Collaborating Center (CC) for Nursing and Midwifery, which is designated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to fulfill activities to address WHO priorities. Lake spearheaded this initiative that included six other Pan American CCs and staff of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), comprising a total of 15 co-authors who collaborated over 18 months.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Australian researchers have used an innovative genome-wide screening approach to identify genes, and their encoded proteins, that play critical roles in the prevention of lymphoma development, revealing new potential treatment targets for these blood cancers. The study, published in Nature Communications today, has identified a group of proteins known as the GATOR1 complex as essential tumor suppressors. When GATOR1 components are lost or defective, this protective mechanism fails, allowing cells to grow uncontrollably. The team utilized sophisticated pre-clinical models of aggressive lymphoma to systematically test the function of all known genes in this complex. Their comprehensive screening approach revealed that when any of the GATOR1 genes are lacking, lymphoma development is dramatically accelerated, identifying the GATOR1 complex as a crucial suppressor of blood cancer development. Co-lead author Dr Margaret Potts said: "The best thing about performing a well-designed CRISPR screen is that you will always find something. "Our unbiased screening approach looked at all genes, rather than just a subset of them. Strikingly, existing drugs that target the same cellular pathways that GATOR1 typically controls were highly effective at slowing the growth of lymphomas in GATOR1-deficient pre-clinical models. These drugs have previously had limited success in cancer treatment, and this may be because researchers have not been able to identify which patients would respond well to these therapeutics. "Our paper begins the exploration into this precision medicine opportunity," shared Dr Potts. "Our pre-clinical lymphoma model is driven by high levels of the oncogene MYC, an abnormality that can be found in ~70% of all human cancers. When GATOR1 is lacking, it removes a critical brake that normally slows MYC-driven malignancy. This exciting discovery provides a new insight into the development and sustained expansion of cancer, which we hope will underpin the development of more effective, targeted treatments for cancer."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blood pressure readings differ considerably according to where and how they are taken, especially when a patient already has hypertension, according to a recent systematic review and network meta-analysis in Annals of Internal Medicine. “Office blood pressure measurements may be misleading owing to white-coat or masked hypertension phenomena, and current guidelines advocate for out-of-office monitoring,” said Hao-Min Cheng, MD, PhD, a cardiologist and director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Taipei Veterans General Hospital in Taipei, Taiwan, and an author of the study. “Only limited research has directly compared all major methods or investigated whether discrepancies fluctuate at varying blood pressure levels — an essential gap we aimed to address.” Cheng and his colleagues observed clinically important differences between research reference office-based blood pressure measurement (OBPM) and those taken in other settings, differing from guidelines on hypertension diagnosis. “Acknowledge that out-of-office measurements are typically diminished, especially during nocturnal hours, and employ BP [blood pressure]-level-specific reference values instead of standardized modifications.” To compare blood pressure estimates across settings using an office reading based on a research protocol as the reference value, the investigators analyzed 65 studies involving 40,022 adults through October 2024. Studies were included if they contained data on readings with at least two of the following methods: research OBPM taken by professionals using standardized protocols, an automated and unattended OBPM, convenient OBPM taken with no defined protocols, blood pressure measurement automatically measured at home, and ambulatory blood pressure measurement taken at regular intervals for several hours. Daytime readings taken in the ambulatory setting and automated readings in the office were 4.22 mm Hg and 4.57 mm Hg lower, respectively. With greater divergence from the mean reference linked to higher blood pressure levels, the variations were not likely to be random, Cheng said. “It is often assumed that the 24-hour ambulatory BPM [blood pressure measurement] average (including both daytime and nighttime readings) for systolic BP is approximately 10 mm Hg lower than routine office measurements,” wrote Gregory Murphy, MB BCh, cardiology fellow, and John W. McEvoy, MB BCh, PhD, professor of preventive cardiology at the University of Galway School of Medicine and the National Institute for Prevention and Cardiovascular Health in Galway, Ireland, in an accompanying editorial. Recent guidelines for detecting and managing hypertension recommend timely drug therapy if blood pressure stays at or above 130/80 mm Hg after 3-6 months of lifestyle changes. “Doctors who deal with hypertension all the time — cardiologists, internists, primary care doctors — already know you don't diagnose and treat hypertension based on one or two readings in the office,” Hematpour said. Cheng said he and his colleagues are soon launching a randomized controlled trial of the clinical effectiveness of various methods for detecting and managing hypertension. The study authors, Hematpour, McEvoy, and Murphy, reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emerging insights into the gut-lung axis continue to open new possibilities for managing chronic respiratory diseases, from cystic fibrosis (CF) in the youngest patients to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in older adults. Despite growing evidence linking gut health to respiratory disease pathogenesis, these findings are not yet ready for routine clinical application. “For most lung diseases, the majority of the literature on gut health that changes lung disease pathogenesis is from research studies,” explained Rachel Scheraga, MD, pulmonologist and critical care physician at Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland. Although studies have explored gut metabolites and lung microbiome changes associated with gut dysbiosis, they cannot yet lead to evidence-based dietary interventions for patients without further clinical trials in humans. But there are some practical gut-lung connections that currently impact practice. This is an especially important step for patients with end-stage lung disease awaiting transplant, given the link between poor gut health and an increased risk for transplant rejection. Once it is determined what specifically the gut is doing to cause lung disease progression, then clinical research can be performed to modify this factor and see if the lung disease improves.” This area of research must be collaborative — and pulmonologists play a key role.” While many studies have documented associations between gut dysbiosis and chronic lung disease, the mechanisms remain poorly defined. This work has been done in close collaboration with Juliette Madan, MD, MS, and Julie Sanville, DO, physician-scientists at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire. We are also developing probiotic strategies that I think could have great potential.” “Understanding this connection lets us develop new means to help address airway disease. As diet and nutritional status are recognized as modulators of lung health through the gut-lung axis, personalized nutrition has the potential to be as complementary to pharmacologic therapy, said Inês Brandão, PhD, Head of Research at Centro de Apoio Tecnológico Agro Alimentar, Castelo Branco, Portugal, a Portugal-based research and innovation center focused on the agri-food sector. “Moving forward,” Brandão said, “building a shared understanding through collaboration between researchers, clinicians, and nutrition experts will be essential to provide clear, practical guidance for pulmonologists.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When triple-negative breast cancer grows, the fat cells around it seem to shrink. UCSF researchers have discovered that the cells of these tumors, which are among the deadliest types of breast cancer, build molecular tunnels, called gap junctions, into nearby fat cells. Blocking the gap junctions stopped tumors from growing. Cancers thrive by hijacking the body's energy sources and we've identified how this works in triple negative breast cancer." Andrei Goga, PhD, professor of cell and tissue biology at UCSF, co-leader of the Breast Oncology Program in the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, and senior author of the paper Goga and his team made their discovery by analyzing fat and tumor cells from breast cancer patients, as well as laboratory models of breast cancer. Although no one is yet testing drugs that block gap junctions for breast cancer, there are ongoing clinical trials using these drugs for brain cancer. "This is a golden opportunity for us to develop effective strategies to treat the most aggressive forms of breast cancer."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cell culture is a foundational technology widely used across fields such as pharmaceutical production, regenerative medicine, food science, and materials engineering. Therefore, optimizing the culture medium for specific applications is vital. Recently, machine learning has become a powerful tool for efficient media optimization. However, the experimental data used to train such models often exhibit biological variability caused by fluctuations in cell behavior and noise from experimental procedures or equipment. This variability can significantly reduce the predictive accuracy of machine learning models. In this study, researchers developed a machine learning model that explicitly accounts for biological variability and applied it to identify optimal formulations for serum-free culture media. CHO-K1 cells (derived from Chinese hamster ovary) were cultured in various media, and cell concentrations were measured to quantify biological variability. The researchers integrated data on medium composition, biological variability, and cell density into a machine learning framework that combined multiple algorithms. They further employed active learning-an iterative cycle of model training and experimental validation. As a result, they successfully developed a serum-free culture medium that achieved approximately 1.6-fold higher cell density compared to commercially available products. These findings are expected to aid in the development of more efficient culture media for pharmaceutical manufacturing and regenerative medicine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new national study led by researchers from Carleton University and the University of Toronto reveals that older adults living in greener neighborhoods were less likely to experience depression during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from over 13,000 urban-dwelling participants in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), researchers found that access to nearby green spaces - from public parks and playing fields to tree canopy cover and private gardens along neighbourhood streets - may act as a mental health buffer, especially for those without a prior history of depression, those with fewer economic resources and those with mobility limitations. "Urban greenery wasn't just a backdrop - it played a protective mental health role in one of the most stressful global events in recent history," said Dr. Paul J. Villeneuve, lead author and Professor in the Department of Neuroscience, Carleton University, Canada. Living in green neighborhoods was especially protective for lower-income Canadians. The mental health benefits of residential greenness, which was determined by satellite data, were more pronounced among people with lower wealth - especially those who were not previously depressed. "Our findings suggest that green spaces may have played a modest, yet meaningful, role in supporting the mental well-being of lower-income Canadians during the pandemic, offering some relief amid deepening socio-economic inequities," said co-author Susanna Abraham Cottagiri, doctoral candidate at the School of Medicine at Queen's University. People with mobility challenges gained more from living in greener neighbourhoods. Among individuals without pre-existing depression, those with mobility issues saw stronger benefits from greenness - possibly because their access to more distant green spaces were restricted. "When mobility is limited, the greenery right outside your door may play a particularly important role in supporting mental health and well-being," said co-author Dr. Ying Jiang, Senior Epidemiologist at the Public Health Agency of Canada. People who, prior to the pandemic, had rarely visited places in their neighbourhood outside their own yard saw a greater protective effect from living in greener neighbourhoods during the pandemic. "It appears that the psychological value of green space may increase when social connections are restricted," said Dr. Margaret de Groh, study co-author. "There is a need to expand equitable access to green space, particularly in lower-income neighborhoods, to protect and preserve local greenery, even during public health emergencies, and to integrate green infrastructure into mental health resilience strategies," said co-author Professor Esme Fuller-Thomson at the University of Toronto's Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work and director of the Institute for Life Course & Aging. The researchers drew on satellite data to assess greenness and determine its link to validated depression measures across two time points: pre-pandemic and six months into the pandemic. The study also sheds light on under-explored issues, such as how socioeconomic status, mobility limitations, and social behavior influence the mental health benefits of greenery. However, the authors caution that some of the most vulnerable Canadians - such as those in long-term care - were not represented in their sample.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new review reveals how everyday foods and hidden exposures to formaldehyde may fuel insulin resistance and chip away at memory, but also points to dietary patterns and emerging therapies that could help reduce the risk. Study: Dietary formaldehyde: a silent aggravator of diabetes and cognitive impairments. In a recent review published in the journal Nutrition & Diabetes, researchers synthesized evidence linking diet-derived formaldehyde (FA) with insulin resistance (IR), diabetes mellitus (DM), and cognitive impairment, and outlined practical risk-reduction strategies. ALDH2 enzyme deficiency – caused by common genetic mutations – dramatically impairs the body's ability to clear formaldehyde, allowing it to accumulate in tissues and accelerate diabetic complications.. Daily choices like packaged snacks, sugary beverages, quick-fry meats, and certain seafoods shape long-term risk. At physiological levels (0.01–0.08 mM), FA acts as a neuromodulator supporting memory, but excess FA can worsen insulin resistance and nudge cognition off course. FA is a reactive carbonyl present in everyday life. Typical diets deliver 1.5–14 mg daily, but exposure is uneven: seafood and processed meats tend to carry more, and frequent ultra-processed foods add additional sources. Small repeated inputs matter because they stack on top of endogenous generation from nutrients, potentially aggravating IR and cognition, issues that already touch families coping with DM, aging parents at risk of memory decline, and busy workers who rely on convenience foods. Fructose degrades into reactive carbonyls, including FA, 4.6–271× more readily than glucose. Choline and carnitine in red meat and some fish are converted by the gut microbiota to trimethylamine, then oxidized in the liver to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO); demethylation of TMAO can release FA and has been linked to pancreatic beta-cell stress. Additionally, semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) generates FA from methanol or methylamines. Add in occasional leaching from food-contact materials, and dietary patterns can tip FA balance toward excess. SSAO enzyme activity spikes in diabetic patients, acting like a factory overdrive that churns out extra formaldehyde from everyday compounds like methylamines. Animal studies show that formalin injections acutely raise blood glucose. Human data indicate that circulating FA is higher in people with DM. FA, in turn, promotes glycogen breakdown to glucose and chemically modifies insulin so it binds its receptor less effectively. This loop helps explain why glucose lowering alone may not normalize metabolic and cognitive outcomes when FA burden remains high. IR reflects reduced cellular responsiveness to insulin, while FA can impair the system at multiple levels. At pre-receptor, FA forms adducts with arginine, lysine, and tyrosine on insulin, changing conformation and lowering affinity for the insulin receptor (I-R). At the receptor, similar chemistry and oxidative stress may alter I-R structure or decrease expression, reducing signal initiation. Together, these hits compromise everyday physiology, such as post-meal glucose disposal in muscle and suppression of hepatic glucose output, making ordinary meals more likely to produce prolonged hyperglycemia. Pumpkin seed oil extract demonstrated protective effects in rodent studies, significantly reducing formaldehyde-induced damage to organs like the liver and kidneys. FA elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and suppresses antioxidant systems such as thioredoxin, while chronic hyperglycemia generates hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) as part of normal signaling, increasing redox load. Mitochondria struggle under this pressure: membrane potential falls, respiratory enzymes are inhibited, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production falters. In mice, loss of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), a key FA-degrading enzyme, raises FA, worsens spatial memory, and aggravates hyperglycemia, whereas ALDH2 overexpression improves both memory and glycemia. In people with DM, brain IR and vascular change already threaten cognition; excess FA adds another nudge in the wrong direction. For families, this means that the same exposures that derail glucose may also chip away at attention and memory over time. Creatine supplements – often used by athletes – temporarily elevate hippocampal formaldehyde levels in mice, suggesting a direct diet-brain pathway. Exposure mixtures can be improved, as a Mediterranean-style pattern, characterized by vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and fish in moderation, is associated with lower DM risk and fewer additives. Limiting high-fructose products and processed meats reduces FA precursors. Experimental data suggest FA-buffering options: pumpkin constituents blunt FA-induced oxidative injury; the alkaloid trigonelline from fenugreek curbs microbial conversion of choline; tea polyphenols and phytic acid can inhibit TMAO demethylase in fish products. Beyond diet, better kitchen ventilation, careful heat management, avoiding occupational FA sources, and avoiding damaged melamine-based ware may help reduce non-dietary inputs at home and work. Glycemic control, nutrition, activity, and medicines remain core, yet FA biology opens adjunct avenues. Some agents decrease FA or enhance clearance in preclinical models: omega-3 fatty acids, silymarin, and hydrogen sulfide donors improve cognition or metabolic readouts; metformin may bind FA directly, hinting at dual benefit. Most FA scavengers lack brain specificity or blood-brain barrier penetration; long-term safety is uncertain; and the precise molecular ties among FA, the insulin receptor, and epigenetic regulation need clarification. This review proposes that diet-derived FA is a plausible, modifiable contributor to IR, hyperglycemia, and diabetes-related cognitive impairment. Mechanistic data show that FA can be generated from fructose, choline, carnitine, creatine, and SSAO pathways, can inactivate insulin, stress the I-R, and NMDA receptor function. Clinically, pairing glucose control with exposure reduction, improving dietary patterns, limiting processed meats and high-fructose foods, mitigating occupational risks, and optimizing home air may help. Future trials should test brain-penetrant FA scavengers and integrated lifestyle-pharmacologic approaches.
