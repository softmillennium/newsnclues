                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FLOCK rallied by almost 30% daily, while the rest have recorded more modest increases. The leading US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase added five altcoins to its roadmap on August 21. Among the names is the popular meme coin SPX6900 (SPX) as well as AWE Network (AWE), Dolomite (DOLO), Flock (FLOCK), and Solayer (LAYER). The rest have posted more modest increases, whereas SPX remains in red territory on a daily scale. After all, such backing leads to boosted liquidity, enhanced accessibility, and a better reputation. It is important to note that adding digital assets to the roadmap is not the same as an official listing but rather a necessary step before such an initiative. It is a signal that Coinvase is actively evaluating the involved cryptocurrencies and might allow trading services once they meet certain criteria. “Transfers and trading are not supported for these or any other assets until a listing is officially announced. Depositing these assets into your Coinbase account before an official announcement may lead to permanent loss of funds,” the company warned. This section comprises tokens that are either new to the platform or have relatively low trading volume compared to the broader crypto marketplace. A week later, the exchange added BankrCoin (BNKR), Jito Staked SOL (JITOSOL), and Metaplex (MPLX) to its roadmap. His biggest passion in the field is Bitcoin and he was fascinated with its journey.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>- AI-powered NFTs are transforming static digital assets into interactive companions, boosting user engagement and market relevance. - Challenges remain in AI implementation costs, ownership rights, and market saturation, requiring clearer frameworks for sustainable growth. - Experts predict long-term value for AI-driven NFTs as infrastructure improves, with institutional adoption reinforcing their cultural and financial potential. The NFT market is witnessing renewed interest as AI-powered companion tokens are reshaping digital collectibles into interactive and emotionally resonant experiences. For example, projects like FURO are redefining NFTs by offering 3D digital companions that can learn, remember, and evolve with their users [1]. Hamza Eddiouane, co-creator of the FURO project, emphasized that AI-powered NFTs can foster long-term user engagement, similar to how characters like Tamagotchis or Pokémon have created cultural phenomena [1]. Treasure DAO, part of the $MAGIC token project, recently launched an AI agent creator tool that allows NFT holders to transform their digital assets into autonomous AI agents capable of interacting on social media, playing games, and trading crypto [1]. Such tools are reducing the technical barriers to entry and democratizing NFT content creation [1]. The use of AI is also enabling NFT creators to expand their collections and generate community-driven content at scale. Pudgy Penguins, for example, has integrated an AI-powered platform that allows holders to generate short-form videos using their NFTs [1]. This shift is turning NFTs from static collectibles into dynamic digital assets that can be personalized and adapted to user preferences. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the adoption of AI-powered NFTs. Additionally, concerns around authenticity, ownership rights, and market saturation are being raised by industry stakeholders. Nonetheless, the potential for AI-powered NFTs to redefine digital collectibles is being widely recognized. As regulatory clarity improves and infrastructure develops, the sector is expected to see continued growth. Experts like Sebastien Borget of The Sandbox and Kai Wawrzinek of Impossible Cloud Network are optimistic about the future, noting that AI is not replacing human creativity but enhancing it [1]. With increasing institutional interest and corporate adoption, such as BTCS Inc.'s recent acquisition of Pudgy Penguins NFTs, the long-term value of AI-driven NFTs is likely to be reinforced [3].

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This marks a new milestone following its aggressive acquisition of Toncoin and strategic cash positioning. Most of these funds have been directed into Toncoin, a cryptocurrency powering Telegram's blockchain operations. The move aligns with VERB's treasury strategy targeting blockchain infrastructure. VERB extends its presence beyond traditional tech into digital asset-backed finance. This financial repositioning sets a precedent for firms seeking blockchain-linked treasury strategies. It also grants the Company long-term leverage in staking, governance, and ecosystem activity. By holding such a position, VERB integrates deeply into TON's financial protocols. This move benefits the TON ecosystem by increasing decentralization and liquidity while reinforcing validator support. VERB's approach is not merely passive—it actively supports TON's protocol layer. Through cash flow reinvestments and staking rewards, the Company seeks to expand its crypto holdings per share. VERB maintains $67 million in cash for balance sheet resilience. This cash base allows operational flexibility as the firm shifts into blockchain-centric finance. It also cushions any volatility in the crypto market and supports reinvestment when needed. With cash supporting core operations, the Company can capitalize on short-term opportunities without liquidating Toncoin holdings. This dual approach strengthens financial discipline while anchoring growth in blockchain infrastructure. By holding both digital and fiat reserves, VERB positions itself with a hybrid treasury strategy. This model aligns with institutional trends in blockchain finance and treasury diversification. The firm combines blockchain integration with traditional capital allocation. Its role in supporting TON's economic backbone sets a standard for corporate blockchain engagement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Privacy International has filed a complaint to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) over the Home Office's collection and processing of information in immigration enforcement operations. The complaint filed on 18 August focuses on two algorithmic tools used for processing migrants' personal data, known as Identify and Prioritise Immigration Cases (IPIC) and Electronic Monitoring Review Tool (EMRT). The complaint comes as public sector organisations adopt more automated tools to assist or replace human decision-making. “Individuals are denied any meaningful information about how their data is used,” it said in the complaint. The Identify and Prioritise Immigration Case (IPIC) tool is used for individuals who could be liable for detention or deportation from the UK. The tool prioritises casework for immigrant enforcement and makes automatic recommendations. The Electronic Monitoring Review Tool (EMRT) generates recommendations that relate to the use of GPS ankle tracking as a condition of immigration bail. The tool is used by the Home Office during quarterly Electronic Monitoring (EM) reviews to decide whether GPS tracking remains appropriate. The EMRT uses an automated “harm score” to determine the minimum period an individual will remain subject to a GPS ankle tag. The tool generates automatic recommendations on whether a person should remain on an ankle bracelet or be transitioned to a non-fitted device, which requires people to submit biometric information several times a day. According to Home Office figures, the EMRT tool was used to conduct more than 1,700 quarterly Electronic Monitoring (EM) reviews over an 80-day period in 2023. It is likely that both tools have been used to make recommendations on tens of thousands of data subjects, according to estimates by Privacy International. This may include detention or removal from the UK based on profiling and automated decision-making,” it said. “No coherent and comprehensive information is provided to migrants concerning what information the tools process and how it is used, including what consequences their deployment could have on decisions that may impact their lives,” it added. Privacy International has asked the information commissioner to issue an enforcement notice to prevent the Home Office from collecting and processing personal data using the IPIC and EMRT tools in immigrant enforcement operations. The ICO found the Home Office had failed to assess the intrusive impact of continuously collecting people's location data and its potential impact on people who may be vulnerable because of their asylum status, their inability to speak English, or because they had faced difficult conditions travelling to the UK.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum has outpaced Bitcoin in recent weeks, with JPMorgan analysts pointing to a combination of exchange-traded fund inflows, corporate treasury adoption, regulatory clarity, and structural ETF improvements as the main drivers. Ethereum ETFs saw a record $5.4 billion of inflows in July, matching Bitcoin ETFs for the month, JPMorgan analysts led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou noted in a report Wednesday. While spot Bitcoin ETFs have since recorded small outflows in August, spot Ethereum ETFs have continued to attract capital, the analysts said. Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin, particularly since the U.S. passed the GENIUS Act stablecoin law in July, and as investors anticipate another landmark crypto market structure bill by September. The JPMorgan analysts highlighted four factors behind Ethereum's recent outperformance. First, the market expects the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to approve staking for spot Ethereum ETFs, which would allow asset managers to generate staking yields for investors without requiring them to hold the 32 ETH minimum. Second, corporate treasuries have begun to add Ethereum, with about 10 public companies holding ETH on their balance sheets — representing 2.3% of the current circulating ETH supply. Some of these corporates are expected to run validators to earn passive staking income, while others may pursue yield through liquid staking and decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies, the analysts said. Third, the SEC has offered staff-level clarifications suggesting that liquid staking tokens may not be treated as securities. Fourth, the SEC's recent approval of in-kind redemptions for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs will allow institutions to redeem ETF shares directly in crypto rather than converting to cash. "This brings more efficiency, a reduction in costs, and greater market liquidity to these ETFs and mitigates the need for liquidations during large withdrawals by investors," the JPMorgan analysts said. Looking ahead, the analysts said Ethereum has more room to grow in both ETF and corporate treasury adoption when compared to Bitcoin. Corporate and institutional holdings of ETH currently lag those of BTC, leaving scope for further inflows if adoption trends continue.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The cryptocurrency market is showing signs of a shift as leading altcoins record stronger gains than Bitcoin. However, in recent days it has started to dip, while several major alternative coins have pushed higher. This has raised questions about whether the much-anticipated “altcoin season” could be approaching. The token gained 13% yesterday, wiping out its earlier losses, and has carried that momentum into today with a further 5% rise in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. This upward trend is not limited to Chainlink, as other major altcoins are also posting notable gains. Ethereum has also moved higher after recovering from a brief drop. Over the past 24 hours, it is still up more than 3%, continuing its rebound. Market analyst Michaël van de Poppe described the move as a strong recovery and noted it signals the possibility of another test of previous highs. Together, these moves underline how altcoins are currently outpacing Bitcoin. When compared to sharper rises seen in several altcoins, Bitcoin's performance looks muted. A report from CryptoQuant suggests that demand for Bitcoin has slowed sharply. This cooling demand has been reflected in Bitcoin's share of the overall market. At the same time, altcoins have been gaining traction, showing that investors are increasingly willing to direct capital away from Bitcoin and toward alternative assets. While altcoins are outperforming, analysts suggest this period may not resemble previous cycles. ByteTree analysts Shehriyar Ali and Charlie Morris have pointed out that the next phase, if it develops into a full altcoin season, is unlikely to deliver the same broad surges seen in earlier years. Instead, they expect selective growth, where coins with strong fundamentals and proven utility are rewarded, while weaker tokens without solid backing may struggle to advance. The measure shows that altcoins are holding up strongly against Bitcoin, and the current positioning leaves room for further upside if investor momentum continues to shift toward these assets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin Policy UK, the UK's premier Bitcoin think tank and advocacy group, has launched an app that enables residents of the U.K. to contact their member of parliament (MP) to advocate for Bitcoin in just a few clicks. Bitcoin Policy UK believes that U.K. citizens need to speak up if the British government is going to get policy and regulation around Bitcoin right. Hence, they've launched an easy-to-use app that helps Brits send a letter to their MPs to advocate for Bitcoin and Bitcoin-adjacent topics (e.g., CBDCs). We've built a simple, powerful app that lets any UK resident contact their MP in minutes and speak up for Bitcoin in just a few clicks. “We built the app to make it simple for anyone to connect with their MP and push for clear, sensible Bitcoin policy,” said Bitcoin Policy UK co-founder and CEO Susie Violet Ward. Users begin by inputting their full name, email address and postcode. (Note that the app doesn't require your address or phone number, as it was designed by a privacy-conscious Bitcoiner and new member of the Bitcoin Policy UK team, Sami Shams.) Then, they select one from the following four issues that's most important to them: Members of Bitcoin Policy UK have been hard at work within the halls of power, attempting to educate MPs and other members of government about Bitcoin and why it's essential that the U.K. embraces it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bank of America's (BAC) rates strategy team said the U.S. Treasury market is increasingly shaped by two emerging forces: stablecoin demand for T-bills and the tokenization of government debt-related assets. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold. They play a major role in cryptocurrency markets, providing among other things a payment infrastructure, and are also used to transfer money internationally. According to BofA, some MMF clients are showing increased interest in tokenization, viewing it as a defensive move against stablecoins. The report noted that in July, BNY Mellon (BK), alongside Goldman Sachs (GS), rolled out blockchain-based technology to maintain records of ownership in select MMF shares. With stablecoins currently restricted from paying yield, money market funds see a narrow window to tokenize and offer competitive rates before regulatory changes or workarounds erode that advantage, the report added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China has been expanding use of digital currencies as it promotes wider use of its yuan, or renminbi, to reflect its status as the world's second-largest economy BANGKOK -- China has been expanding use of digital currencies as it promotes wider use of its yuan, or renminbi, to reflect its status as the world's second-largest economy and challenge the overwhelming sway of the U.S. dollar in international trade and finance. However, restrictions on access to Chinese financial markets and limits on convertibility of the yuan, or “people's money,” are big obstacles blocking its global use. Still, Hong Kong already has stablecoin regulations and some Chinese experts are pushing for regulations to prepare for a possible stablecoin pegged to the yuan. Officials at the People's Bank of China and State Council Information Office in Beijing did not immediately respond to requests for comment on a Reuters report that the State Council, or Cabinet, is preparing to issue a plan for internationalizing the yuan that might include a yuan stablecoin. In the U.S., President Donald Trump has made cryptofriendly policies a priority for his administration. He signed a law, the GENIUS Act, last month regulating stablecoins. Stablecoins are digital currencies whose value is linked to a specific currency such as the U.S. dollar. They are based on a reserve equal to their value, but are issued by private institutions, not central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve. Critics of stablecoins say that since they are essentially a proxy for ordinary currencies that can bypass banking systems and safeguards set up to manage traditional financial transactions they may be most useful for illegal purposes. China launched its own digital yuan, the e-CNY issued by its central bank, on a trial basis in 2019, and McDonalds was an early participant in that project. State media reported that as of July 2024, there were 7.3 trillion yuan worth of transactions using the currency in areas where it is being used on a trial basis. China has also been promoting use of e-CNY in Africa, as it expands business dealings on the continent. Experts say regulations are needed to safely manage use of stablecoins and to ensure they could be used smoothly with bank accounts and payment systems. Hong Kong, a former British colony that has its own financial markets, currency and partly autonomous legal system, enacted a stablecoin law that took effect on Aug. 1. Aimed at attracting wealthy investors who want to use digital currencies and other financial products, it requires that a stablecoin linked to the Hong Kong dollar must be equal to the Hong Kong dollar reserves for that digital currency. As a global duty-free port and financial hub, Hong Kong has often served as a base for trying out paths toward liberalizing Chinese financial markets. But new regulations specifically governing yuan stablecoin would be needed if such a digital currency were issued for use in Hong Kong, Liu Xiaochun, deputy director of the Shanghai Institute of New Finance, recently wrote in a report on the Chinese financial website Yicai.com. China's currency is not freely convertible in world financial markets and its stringent controls on foreign exchange are the biggest hindrance toward making the yuan a global currency, experts say. The lion's share of yuan transactions take place in Hong Kong.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Current age verification drives users to VPNs and sketchy sites. Blockchain can prove you're over 18 without exposing your identity to data breaches. To avoid age verification, users either try to avoid the process or look for a less compliant provider. Existing protocols for identity verification are not up to standard. Adult users need to feel reassured that their identity is protected, while minors are prevented from having access. Processes like photo uploads or credit card checks are too outdated to work. Instead, there needs to be an approach that combines anonymity with a legitimate identity. With over 50% of children seeing harmful content online, governments must protect minors. The 1,800% spike in VPN downloads only demonstrates that users of all ages are trying to avoid the verification process. Related: ZKPs can prove I'm old enough without telling you my age Meanwhile, as users avoid age verification through compliant sites, they are more likely to drift to less reputable providers, creating significant security and legal risk. Adults will want to feel assured that their identity is protected. While existing age verification methods promise anonymity, the need for photos or credit card information can be a cause for concern. Existing age verification processes are far too exposed to hacks, blackmail and scandal. Whether it's large retail chains or mobile phone providers, even the most robust systems can be at risk. With identity verification, adult content sites are now a massive target for cyberattacks. Even with the best protocols in place, it's only a matter of time until a site fails to stop an attack. A blockchain system needs to maintain gated access without compromising user privacy. That verified status is then cryptographically linked to their blockchain address — instead of the person's name or photo — via zero-knowledge proofs. This enables identity verification for multiple services without requiring third parties to access the data. This approach goes beyond adult content and has a wide range of uses — from gambling to trade finance. If needed, there are still protocols that can be in place to ensure that user identity is accessible. Should law enforcement need to, processes can be in place that can map the blockchain account back to the verified identity. This ensures that bad actors can be brought to justice in extreme cases. Using identity verification via a blockchain can strike a balance between privacy for the law-abiding and accountability for the malicious. Getting people to accept this new process will be challenging if it relies on outdated methods. Using the blockchain isn't about circumventing age verification or disagreeing with the broader issue of online safety. Instead, it's about establishing a better method that makes it easier for users to embrace this new requirement. If the current wave of regulation teaches us anything, digital anonymity and safety don't have to contradict each other. Maintaining both requires rethinking how identity works online, not as a surveillance tool, but as a selective, user-controlled signal. Achieving a better internet experience will require governments and businesses to move beyond checkbox compliance and start designing systems that reflect how people want to engage online: securely, privately and with agency.

[EXCLUSIVE: Become a News 6 Insider (it's FREE) | PINIT! This breakthrough marks a significant step forward in the fight against crypto scams, which have often left victims without recourse. Victims like Cindy Burns, from Orange County, who lost $15,000 after a bank impersonator convinced her to convert funds to crypto. Elizabeth Bahmann who lives in Ormond Beach told News 6 losing $90,000 took an emotional toll on her. “I was close to taking my life,” she said. Brandon Paige of Orlando lost nearly $600,000 when his crypto hardware wallet was hacked. Detective John Hill leads the Flagler County Sheriff's Office cyber-crimes unit. Few Central Florida law enforcement agencies have the technology. “A lot of times previously we'd have to say, ‘I'm so sorry for your losses',” Hill said when telling victims in the past they couldn't do much about crypto scams. “I'm not going to give a scammer his money back.” With the remaining cash, Hill is looking for other victims who may be connected to his two cases, so he can return their money to them, even if they are in other jurisdictions. Hill emphasized that T-R-M is a game changer, giving law enforcement the tools needed to advance investigations into cryptocurrency fraud. If you have been the victim of a crypto scam and think your case could be connected, contact the Flagler County Sheriff's Office.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Toyota, the world's largest automaker with over 10.8 million vehicle sales in 2024, is expanding its blockchain footprint. Through its R&D arm, Toyota Blockchain Lab, the company unveiled a new framework: Mobility Orchestration Network (MON), aimed at creating a trust-first digital layer for global mobility systems. At the announcement date August 20, 2025, the prototype MON is conceptualized to mediate relations that support mobility ownership of vehicles, compliance with insurance, taxation, proof of safety audits, and operational data. Toyota emphasizes MON as a response to three structural challenges in mobility: The design makes financial flows, operative data and regulatory proofs to be synchronized modular.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. For years, the world of cryptocurrencies operated as a financial Wild West, characterized by unchecked speculation, regulatory ambiguity, and occasionally spectacular downfalls. Now, just about three years after the collapse of exchange FTX shattered confidence in the sector, lawmakers are actively engaging in shaping rules to govern cryptos, classifying them as either commodities or securities. That, in turn, will remove the ambiguity and overlap over regulation, making investing less of a risk. “It adds more certainty that [cryptocurrency] is here to stay," Jamie Hopkins, CEO of Bryn Mawr Trust Advisors told Barron's. For years, it has been unclear just where crypto fits in to the world of financial assets. Despite their name, cryptocurrencies aren't regulated as currencies and there have been legal cases over whether certain tokens should be considered commodities or securities. “It creates a cautionary principle where you don't go to the edge of the cliff," Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan tells Barron's. The regulator charged Ripple in 2020 for selling XRP, which it considered an unregistered security. Ripple denied the accusations, arguing that XRP didn't act like a security and therefore shouldn't be subject to securities control. A district judge issued a split ruling in 2023 stating that retail XRP sales on public exchanges didn't qualify as securities transactions, however, some institutional sales did. In August this year, they jointly filed for dismissal of the case. Stablecoins, or coins typically pegged to the dollar that act like a crypto version of a money-market fund, have their own category and would fall under joint oversight of the SEC and the CFTC. The Act's backers say it gives the sector just that, while critics argue it doesn't do enough to ensure effective ways to enforce its rules and provide enough protection. The act still needs to pass through the Senate, which has published its own discussion draft market structure bill that would likely put most cryptos under SEC jurisdiction, although with exemptions from many aspects of securities laws. Most will want to avoid the latter, Hougan says. Law firm McMillan suggests a reconciliation process is expected that will converge both bills into a final text for passage. So far Bitcoin and Ether have typically been considered commodities by regulators due to their distinct decentralized nature of a broad ownership and governance structure, but most other coins remain largely undefined. Comparing them to Bitcoin or Ether would be like comparing the world's most valuable company, Nvidia, to a penny stock, Hougan says. For Bitcoin and Ether, regulatory advancements will be “strictly positive," he adds. The total cryptocurrency market has a value of nearly $4 trillion—around the same as Microsoft—with Bitcoin accounting for about two thirds of that. The rest is altcoins, or alternative coins, of which there are thousands. About 80 tokens have a market capitalization of more than $1 billion, according to CoinDesk data. The new law could give cryptos tied to a blockchain a leg up on their competitors, according to Professor Sarit Markovich at Kellogg School of Management. She sees cryptos tied to a blockchain like Ether, Solana, and Ripple's XRP as “two-sided markets"—operating systems with app developers on one side and users on the other. Regulatory clarity and legitimacy would bring more users to these ecosystems, increasing their value and the price of the tokens tied to them, she says. In contrast, the long-term prospects for meme coins such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or $TRUMP, despite potential short-term price bumps, appear more challenging. Meme coins don't typically have their own blockchain but are built on top of other blockchains. While financial advisors are coming round to making a place for cryptos in portfolios, they are divided on coins besides Bitcoin. Hopkins says he recommends clients interested in cryptos invest between 1% and 3% in via spot ETFs such as those by Fidelity, BlackRock, and Bitwise, leaning toward the lower end of that range, as opposed to investing in the coins themselves. Bitwise also offers funds tracking the price of a basket of coins like the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund, which is heavily overweight on Bitcoin but also includes 1% or more of Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano, as well as minor holdings of Chainlink, Sui, Avalanche, Litecoin, and Polkadot. If passed, the legislation would remove a key impediment to investing in crypto by providing much-needed regulatory clarity. The Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund may be a good place to start. While many still oppose cryptos altogether, that battle appears to have been fought and lost. Download the Mint app and read premium stories You are just one step away from creating your watchlist!
