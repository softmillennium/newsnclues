                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kanye West, the hip-hop artist who goes by Ye, appears to have launched his own cryptocurrency, YZY, sparking a riot of trading activity. In February, West rejected the idea that he might launch a crypto coin. “COINS PREY ON THE FANS WITH HYPE.” He seems to have changed his mind. On Wednesday evening, West's X account announced the YZY coin in two posts. “The official Yeezy token just dropped,” said West, in a strangely deadpan video clip that some X users speculated was AI-generated. As traders piled in, the coin's paper value surged to $3 billion, then plummeted by two-thirds in the span of three hours as early investors cashed out. The majority of traders have recorded losses, collectively losing more than $20 million, says blockchain analytics company Nansen. Most infamously, West made a series of antisemitic remarks in 2022 that drew widespread condemnation and led Adidas to abandon a lucrative partnership with his design label. In May, he released a music video entitled “Heil Hitler.” The YZY coin is supposedly part of a grander constellation of products called YZY Money, which also purports to include a crypto payments service and debit card. “YZY Money is a concept to put you in control, free from centralized authority,” the website claims. The company cannot gain access to those coins for at least three months, a common practice meant to prevent issuers from dumping their holdings and sinking the price of a coin. Yeezy Investments operates the YZY Money website under a licence granted by Ox Paha Inc., a company through which West manages his intellectual property, the terms and conditions state. Typically, rookie crypto traders are warned away from coins whose supply is concentrated in the hands of a small number of parties, for fear they might sell off their holdings en masse, driving down the price of the coin. “You have to consider longer down the line,” says Nicolai Søndergaard, research analyst at Nansen. “They have been quite profitable and exited fully already,” alleges Søndergaard. “It seems to insinuate there might have been some, let's say, possible information leak.” In trading any new asset, an early warning would put any trader at an immense advantage, allowing them to buy in earlier and at a lower price than almost everyone else. That effect is amplified with coins issued by high-profile celebrities, which tend to attract an onrush of investors at release. A request for comment delivered to an email address listed on the YZY Money website went unanswered. (Each settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but did not admit to wrongdoing.) But when US president Donald Trump launched his own $TRUMP memecoin in January, a few days before his inauguration, he established a playbook that any celebrity might imagine they could follow with impunity. The YZY debut mirrors the $TRUMP launch in a number of ways: Both were announced suddenly on social media, leading to confusion about their legitimacy. “It's like the new golden rule for tokens from famous people,” says Søndergaard. “I have blocked celeb coins out of my general daily thoughts ...

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI models can respond to text, audio, and video in ways that sometimes fool people into thinking a human is behind the keyboard, but that doesn't exactly make them conscious. It's not like ChatGPT experiences sadness doing my tax return … right? Well, a growing number of AI researchers at labs like Anthropic are asking when — if ever — might AI models develop subjective experiences similar to living beings, and if they do, what rights they should have. The debate over whether AI models could one day be conscious — and merit legal safeguards — is dividing tech leaders. Microsoft's CEO of AI, Mustafa Suleyman, published a blog post on Tuesday arguing that the study of AI welfare is “both premature, and frankly dangerous.” Suleyman's views may sound reasonable, but he's at odds with many in the industry. Last week, Anthropic's AI welfare program gave some of the company's models a new feature: Claude can now end conversations with humans who are being “persistently harmful or abusive.“ Beyond Anthropic, researchers from OpenAI have independently embraced the idea of studying AI welfare. Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google DeepMind did not immediately respond to TechCrunch's request for comment. Suleyman's hardline stance against AI welfare is notable given his prior role leading Inflection AI, a startup that developed one of the earliest and most popular LLM-based chatbots, Pi. While the vast majority of users have healthy relationships with these AI chatbots, there are concerning outliers. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says that less than 1% of ChatGPT users may have unhealthy relationships with the company's product. Larissa Schiavo, a former OpenAI employee who now leads communications for Eleos, told TechCrunch in an interview that Suleyman's blog post misses the mark. “Rather than diverting all of this energy away from model welfare and consciousness to make sure we're mitigating the risk of AI related psychosis in humans, you can do both. In fact, it's probably best to have multiple tracks of scientific inquiry.” Schiavo argues that being nice to an AI model is a low-cost gesture that can have benefits even if the model isn't conscious. Schiavo responded to Gemini with a pep talk — saying things like “You can do it!” — while another user offered instructions. It's not common for Gemini to talk like this, but there have been several instances in which Gemini seems to act as if it's struggling through life. Suleyman believes it's not possible for subjective experiences or consciousness to naturally emerge from regular AI models. Instead, he thinks that some companies will purposefully engineer AI models to seem as if they feel emotion and experience life. One area where Suleyman and Schiavo agree is that the debate over AI rights and consciousness is likely to pick up in the coming years. That may raise new questions about how humans interact with these systems. For secure communication, you can contact us via Signal at @rebeccabellan.491 and @mzeff.88.

Although China has been trying to move away from foreign chips for several years now, the Financial Times says that this effort has now intensified after being fueled by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick saying the aim was to make China "addicted" to US tech during an interview after Washington allowed Nvidia to resume the sales of its H20 to the country, using a term that holds signifcant cultural undertones in China. He also added, “So you want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack. China has directed its regulatory bodies, including the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), to find ways to force Chinese tech institutions to move away from buying Nvidia H20 chips. The Financial Times says that companies have been holding off on purchases and reducing their orders for Nvidia's AI GPUs because of this. This follows some of the broader initiatives already underway. Chinese regulators have recently been pushing companies away from Nvidia AI GPUs, especially the H20, with state media calling it unsafe and outdated, the government telling local companies to avoid it, and mandating that domestic data centers should purchase at least 50% of their AI chips from local manufacturers. This might be a problem for the company, especially as Nvidia initially reported seeing high demand for the H20 and ordering more chips from TSMC to satisfy this huge appetite from China. Nevertheless, it's unlikely that the American AI giant will be completely supplanted by its domestic rivals anytime soon. Although competitors like Huawei and Cambricon are capable of producing chips that, on paper, can compete with what Nvidia has to offer for specific applications, the latter's tech stack is still the primary reason why Chinese tech companies are hesitant to move away from it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hertz Car Sales is now selling its pre-owned vehicles on Amazon Autos, the marketplace launched by the tech giant last year, allowing shoppers to browse inventory and purchase a car online before picking it up at a Hertz location. Seattle is among the initial locations for such a transaction, along with Dallas, Houston and Los Angeles, Hertz announced this week. Hertz is offering pre-owned models from Nissan, Toyota, Chevrolet, Volvo and others. A 2024 Volkswagen Jetta, for instance, with 14,900 miles, is priced at $18,000. Hertz says vehicles are offered at competitive prices, often below Kelley Blue Book suggested retail value. Known primarily as a rental car company, Hertz sells thousands of vehicles each year through its dozens of used car dealerships across the U.S. and Canada. Hertz, which went bankrupt during the pandemic, called the move a significant step in its broader transformation strategy, “which includes forging innovative technology partnerships to provide a more seamless customer experience.” Vehicle shopping and purchases within the Amazon store come with some of the familiar features that Amazon shoppers are used to, such as customer reviews, seller (dealership) reviews, add to cart, and Amazon's familiar checkout process.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Insta360 wanted to upset the staid design of action cameras two years ago with its Insta360 Go 3 and its odd magnetic camera pod. As much as I may want to stick a camera on my fridge, most users still want a device that will shoot video of the same quality as their average GoPro—no matter if the camera itself is the size of their thumb. As with most lenses, inevitably, you have to go bigger. It makes this magnetic action camera slightly larger, but if it means shooting at 4K and 60 fps, plus a better sensor for low-light shooting, then it could prove a fair trade. No, it's not as exciting as Insta360's homegrown Antigravity A1 360-degree camera drone, but this iteration may be the true realization of the Go lineup. The concept behind these tiny cameras is twofold. You can keep the lens inside its housing and use it like any other GoPro or DJI Osmo Action camera. However, if you want to stick the camera in odd places, you can remove it from its housing and attach it to several kinds of magnetic mounts. Already, it's a much more versatile device than last year's Insta360 Go 3S. In my experience, shooting at 4K will result in just under 40 minutes of battery life before it needs to return to its main housing. While the main unit is only going to last around 1 hour and 30 minutes, it supports fast charging up to 80% in 12 minutes. The detachable Go Ultra cube weighs in at 53g, which is bigger than previous iterations, but it's still so light it won't weigh anything down unless you attach it to a sheet of loose-leaf paper. The new, larger cube-shaped pod also allows room for a bigger 1/1.28-inch sensor, which Insta360 says will capture better low-light footage. The camera lens has an f/2.85 aperture and a 14.27mm focal length. If you're snapping photos, the Go Ultra can take up to 50-megapixel resolution shots. No matter what, a smaller-sized camera will be more limited than full-body action cams. Adaptive HDR for shooting better contrast will also limit the frame rate. I practice historical sword fighting twice a week. One of the biggest issues trying to capture footage of my fights has been the awful lighting at my gym. The Insta360 Go Ultra let me stick the camera on my fencing mask and capture low-light POV footage that appeared clearer than most past attempts with various GoPros. The box itself comes with a magnetic pendant you can stick under your shirt, allowing the Go Ultra pod to stick to your chest. There's an additional magnetic clip designed to hook onto the edge of your hat or helmet. Compared to the straitjacket of a GoPro chest mount or hanging a camera from one of the competing company's stick-on adhesive mounts, the Go Ultra is less of an encumbrance. I found the magnet built into the Go Ultra is relatively strong, but you can't stick it to the side of your bike frame and expect it to stay in place. You'll still need a magnet of some kind to keep your footage steady and stop your camera from flying away if you take a tumble. At least the Go Ultra pod still supports Apple Find My if it ever gets misplaced. It's $50 more expensive than last year's flagship GoPro and $100 over the DJI Osmo Action 5.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sustainability: News about the rapidly growing climate tech sector and other areas of innovation to protect our planet. More than three months after announcing layoffs and issuing a public letter asking for money, General Fusion today shared that it has raised $22 million and added board members. General Fusion aims to produce clean energy by generating plasma and smashing together light atoms — replicating the reactions that power the sun and stars. Twinney reports that the machine is generating plasmas, which are super hot, ionized gases needed for fusion. One year ago, General Fusion shared news of $15 million in new funding. But in early May, its CEO disclosed that the effort was at “one of the most challenging financial moments in our history.” Including the new funding, General Fusion has raised about $366 million through government grants and investments. The company is backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and this spring added Bob Smith, former CEO of Bezos' Blue Origin space venture, as a strategic adviser. General Fusion previously set a goal of reaching 100 million degrees Celsius with LM26 by this year, and had aimed by 2026 to hit an energy-producing target of “scientific breakeven equivalent.” That milestone is an intermediate benchmark towards commercial energy production and was first reached by the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 2022. Washington state's Helion Energy has the most ambitious timeline for commercialization, aiming to start producing fusion energy in 2028 at a reactor being built on the Columbia River. The Eastern Washington project — which is supposed to serve Microsoft data centers — broke ground in July. “Innovation doesn't go in a straight line; it demands resilience and collaboration,” Twinney said.

The new smartphone offers higher performance, bigger batteries with faster charging, magnetic wireless charging, and seven years of software support. From that, what's perhaps more noteworthy is that Google allegedly switched to TSMC ahead of Apple, TSMC's alpha customer. Both Pixel 9 and Pixel 10 handsets maintain a nearly identical look to their predecessors, with new finishes in Moonstone, Obsidian, Porcelain, and Jade. The flagship Pixel 10 Pro features a 6.3-inch LTPO OLED at a 1280×2856 resolution, while the beyond-flagship XL grows to 6.8 inches at 1344×2992. It is the first Pixel processor manufactured by TSMC, moving away from Samsung's fabrication, which historically lagged in efficiency. This switch is expected to bring both higher performance and better power management. For AI-driven tasks, the improvements are even more substantial, with a 60% boost in performance. However, it's worth noting that this claim comes from Google, and there's no information provided about the data formats used. It appears the chip uses TSMC's N3P (a performance-enhanced 3nm-class process technology) fabrication process, the most advanced foundry technology that currently exists. The motivation for Google's move may be that TSMC has consistently delivered stronger yields and more refined transistor designs at 3nm-class, enabling higher performance at lower power. TSMC's N3P manufacturing process is an optical shrink of the N3E platform, offering tangible gains in performance, efficiency, and density while retaining full design compatibility, which is not the case for Google's IP. This balance gives designers a lot of flexibility in terms of either pushing for higher performance or optimizing for longer battery life and reduced thermal output, depending on product goals, which was perhaps Google's goal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Korea's political and business scenes are being shaken up by the thought of a U.S. stake in Samsung. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. South Korea's presidential office has denied that the U.S. government is looking to purchase Samsung stocks, with the Blue House saying that these are unfounded rumors. There were also reports that Lutnick wanted to expand that deal to other CHIPS Act recipients, which include Samsung. The South Korean conglomerate was set to receive more than $6 billion in CHIPS Act funding, which was designed to support the construction and expansion of its Taylor, Texas, fab. Although this is a much smaller amount than what Intel received, in both absolute terms and in relation to its market capitalization of more than $300 billion, the fact that there's even talk of a foreign government taking a stake in South Korea's crown jewel will stir trouble within its political and business realms. A few experts suggest that the U.S. acquiring shares in Samsung would be beneficial for all involved, as it would make it easier for the company to access the U.S. market and might even help it avoid import taxes. Some estimates suggest that the company's revenue makes up around 20% of South Korea's GDP. So, despite the numerous domestic political scandals the company has been involved in in recent years, its government still wants to ensure that it remains an independent Korean company with no foreign influence, even if it's coming from its own ally. There will be a long and arduous negotiation if ever the U.S. pushes through with this idea and asks for equity in exchange for the money it has granted the company. For example, TSMC is also partially owned by Taiwan and the Singapore wealth fund. However, these are questions that must be answered before Samsung and South Korea will even agree to any deal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wants to buy planes for Immigration and Customs Enforcement that would be dedicated to deporting as many migrants as possible, according to a new report from NBC News. And it seems extremely likely that she'll get them, given the fact that recent legislation allocated billions in new funding for ICE. Historically, ICE has used planes owned by private companies for deportation flights, chartering 8-14 planes at a time during President Joe Biden's time in office, according to NBC News. Biden was deporting about 15,000 immigrants per month, less than half of the Trump regime's rough goal. The Trump regime deported somewhere between 100,000 to 150,000 people in the first six months of Trump's new term, but that seems to include people who “self-deported,” according to NBC News. News of the possibility that Noem could procure planes for ICE comes as Wired has revealed phone searches at the U.S. border by CBP have soared to a record high. The so-called Big Beautiful Bill was signed into law last month and includes $170 billion for immigration enforcement, including an additional $75 billion just for ICE. That money is allowing ICE to open up new detention facilities and hire new officers, many of whom are terrorizing communities across the U.S. right now. That also will hypothetically allow ICE to buy planes, which could cost anywhere from $80 million to $400 million each, depending on which airliners the agency chooses. If ICE chooses to buy its own planes, the agency will be responsible for maintaining them, which will add additional costs. But Noem probably isn't too worried about that, now that Republicans have given her what CBS News dubbed an “unprecedented level of funding.” The new ICE budget rivals the budgets of major militaries around the world. Chartering planes was already expensive for ICE, at a cost of roughly $25,000 per hour, according to NBC, which covers the cost of things like pilots, flight attendants, security, and medical staff. But it will theoretically be even more expensive if ICE chooses to buy its own dedicated planes. And people were outraged, insisting the FBI didn't need its own air force. But we are well past an era when overreach by law enforcement was something that might get major pushback in the U.S. We live in a country that's been taken over by literal fascists, and they are going to remake the nation in their image.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“These nation-state hackers are hacking for all the wrong reasons. I hope more of them will get exposed; they deserve to be,” said Saber, who spoke to TechCrunch after he and cyb0rg published an article in the legendary hacking e-zine Phrack, disclosing details of their findings. There are countless cybersecurity companies and researchers who closely track anything the North Korean government and its many hacking groups are up to, which includes espionage operations, as well as increasingly large crypto heists and wide-ranging operations where North Koreans pose as remote IT workers to fund the regime's nuclear weapons program. In this case, Saber and cyb0rg went one step further and actually hacked the hackers, an operation that can give more, or at least different, insights into how these government-backed groups work, as well as “what they are doing on a daily basis and so on,” as Saber put it. The hackers want to be known only by their handles, Saber and cyb0rg, because they may face retaliation from the North Korean government, and possibly others. Saber said that they consider themselves hacktivists, and he name-dropped legendary hacktivist Phineas Fisher, responsible for hacking spyware makers FinFisher and Hacking Team, as an inspiration. At the same time, the hackers also understand that what they did is illegal, but they thought it was nonetheless important to publicize it. “Keeping it for us wouldn't have been really helpful,” said Saber. Saber said they are convinced that while the hacker — who they call “Kim” — works for North Korea's regime, they may actually be Chinese and work for both governments, based on their findings that Kim did not work during holidays in China, suggesting that the hacker may be based there. Also, according to Saber, at times Kim translated some Korean documents into simplified Chinese using Google Translate. “I'd probably tell him to use his knowledge in a way that helps people, not hurt them. But he lives in constant propaganda and likely since birth so this is all meaningless to him.” He's referring to the strict information vacuum that North Koreans live in, as they are largely cut off from the outside world. North Korean hackers have a history of targeting people who work in the cybersecurity industry as well. “Not much can be done about this, definitely being more careful though :),” said Saber.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google has just released a technical report detailing how much energy its Gemini apps use for each query. The company also provided average estimates for the water consumption and carbon emissions associated with a text prompt to Gemini. It's the most transparent estimate yet from a Big Tech company with a popular AI product, and the report includes detailed information about how the company calculated its final estimate. As AI has become more widely adopted, there's been a growing effort to understand its energy use. But public efforts attempting to directly measure the energy used by AI have been hampered by a lack of full access to the operations of a major tech company. Earlier this year, MIT Technology Review published a comprehensive series on AI and energy, at which time none of the major AI companies would reveal their per-prompt energy usage. Google's new publication, at last, allows for a peek behind the curtain that researchers and analysts have long hoped for. “We wanted to be quite comprehensive in all the things we included,” said Jeff Dean, Google's chief scientist, in an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review about the new report. There's also backup equipment needed in case something fails—these idle machines account for 10% of the total. The final 8% is from overhead associated with running a data center, including cooling and power conversion. Estimates like Google's are generally something that only companies can produce, because they run at a larger scale than researchers are able to and have access to behind-the-scenes information. Google's figure, however, is not representative of all queries submitted to Gemini: The company handles a huge variety of requests, and this estimate is calculated from a median energy demand, one that falls in the middle of the range of possible queries. Here's how MIT Technology Review waded through a mess of data and hidden variables to calculate the individual and collective energy demand from AI. So some Gemini prompts use much more energy than this: Dean gives the example of feeding dozens of books into Gemini and asking it to produce a detailed synopsis of their content. Using a reasoning model could also have a higher associated energy demand because these models take more steps before producing an answer. This report was also strictly limited to text prompts, so it doesn't represent what's needed to generate an image or a video. (Other analyses, including one in MIT Technology Review's Power Hungry series earlier this year, show that these tasks can require much more energy.) The report also finds that the total energy used to field a Gemini query has fallen dramatically over time. Google also estimates the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the median prompt, which they put at 0.03 grams of carbon dioxide. The company has signed agreements to buy over 22 gigawatts of power from sources including solar, wind, geothermal, and advanced nuclear projects since 2010. AI data centers also consume water for cooling, and Google estimates that each prompt consumes 0.26 milliliters of water, or about five drops. The goal of this work was to provide users a window into the energy use of their interactions with AI, Dean says. “People are using [AI tools] for all kinds of things, and they shouldn't have major concerns about the energy usage or the water usage of Gemini models, because in our actual measurements, what we were able to show was that it's actually equivalent to things you do without even thinking about it on a daily basis,” he says, “like watching a few seconds of TV or consuming five drops of water.” The publication greatly expands what's known about AI's resource usage. “I'm really happy that they put this out,” says Sasha Luccioni, an AI and climate researcher at Hugging Face. “People want to know what the cost is.” This estimate and the supporting report contain more public information than has been available before, and it's helpful to get more information about AI use in real life, at scale, by a major company, Luccioni adds. However, there are still details that the company isn't sharing in this report. One major question mark is the total number of queries that Gemini gets each day, which would allow estimates of the AI tool's total energy demand. “This is not a replacement or proxy for standardized comparisons.” An exclusive conversation with Mark Chen and Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI's twin heads of research, about the path toward more capable reasoning models—and superalignment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The latest addition to China's Tiangong space station is an AI chatbot with expertise in navigation and tactical planning. Named Wukong AI—after the protagonist of the “Monkey King” legend in Chinese mythology, Sun Wukong—the chatbot was introduced on the space station in mid-July, and has already completed its first mission: supporting three taikonauts during a spacewalk. Chinese authorities have said that they developed it from a domestic open-source AI model; according to Xinhua, China's state-run news agency, engineers designed it to meet the requirements of manned space missions, and focused its knowledge-base on aerospace flight data. “This system can provide rapid and effective information support for complex operations and fault handling by crew members, improving work efficiency, in-orbit psychological support, and coordination between space and ground teams,” Zou Pengfei of the taikonaut training center, told Xinhua. Technicians connected the AI to Tiangong on July 15. It began providing support a month later, this being the first time that China's space station has used a large language model (LLM) during in-orbit missions. The taikonauts claim that their new assistant “offers very comprehensive content.” Chinese media describe Wukong AI as a classic question-and-answer system divided into two modules: one installed on the station, and one on Earth. The International Space Station already has Astrobee, a robot that assists astronauts with routine tasks, and CIMON, a conversational psychological support system. The particularity of Wukong AI is that it combines the functions of an intelligent assistant—like those used on Earth—with a total focus on space navigation. The station currently serves as a microgravity laboratory for experiments that would be impossible on Earth. In China, he symbolizes cunning, adaptability, endurance, and the pursuit of knowledge.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Good design involves technical ability, industrial know-how, creativity, innovation, adaptability, and a generous helping of luck to pull the strands together. Getting it right the first time almost never happens. Converse came close with the Chuck Taylor All-Star, of course, first launched in 1922 and barely altered since. Then there's the Sharpie marker pen, which hasn't changed since 1964. This patent, number EP 0 026 800 B1, was filed in 1979 and has long since expired. Turning 50 this year, a Brompton looks and performs unlike any other bicycle. Then the handlebars and seat post collapse down, locking everything into position. To stop the chain from flopping about when the bike is folded, Brompton developed a chain tensioner that keeps it taut at all times. This unique derailleur is the keystone to its success. It's an ingeniously compact and highly transportable cycling solution—the latest T Line titanium bike weighs 16.4 pounds (7.45 kg)—all of which are made in the UK. Located in Ealing, northwest London, the Brompton factory currently employs around 800 people and churns out 2,000 bikes a week, which are then sold in 47 countries around the world. This metal joining technique—requiring 18 months of in-house training, and a feature on every variety of Brompton since 1975—uses melted brass to glue the steel together, rather than melting the steel in traditional welding. “It requires a lower, safer working temperature,” explains manufacturing engineer Alex Watkins. Watching the 50th Anniversary C Line Brompton production line, Watkins explains that, “with 19 stations taking one minute and 38 seconds each, we can build a Brompton in 30.2 minutes, or 313 per day.” In contrast, it took Andrew Ritchie almost 10 years to turn his initial idea—inspired by a clunky bike from the OG folding-bike brand Bickerton—into a commercially viable vehicle. But it's the first production model from 1986 that's most striking. Aside from a different folding clip and a marginally more acute bend in the frame, it looks every bit the modern Brompton. Given how fundamentally unchanged the design is since conception, could the boffins at Brompton salvage this bike, or even bring it up to date? Despite its being one of the first 12,000 made, Valentino Pala, prototyping engineer, is optimistic. “It's in excellent condition for such an old bike, and since we've not altered the specific dimensions of the frame, we should be able to simply swap out old components for new.” “We're then going to rebuild it around the main frame and fork.” Now, while WIRED appreciates this is going to be a Brompton stowed safely on the Ship of Theseus, it remains an impressive, decade-spanning example of good design, and the importance of considered, rather than reactionary upgrades. This sort of advanced-level repairability is par for the course for Brompton, and if you have your own tired old folding bike, every nut, bolt, bracket, and accessory is available to order. If bike maintenance isn't something you're comfortable with, there's a detailed list of all Brompton stores and authorized dealers on the company's website, with around 150 across the USA. In the UK, especially around London, there's plenty of scope for repairs, and Brompton offers a complete service at one of its dealerships for £295 (less than $400.) It's a bike for people who wouldn't necessarily call themselves cyclists, with a uniform in some countries that's more Lacroix than lycra. “We're very globally spread out,” says Will Carleysmith, Brompton's chief design and engineering officer. In Asia, the Brompton is viewed quite differently than in the UK, where it's typically seen as a practical tool for urban commuting. “It's a super social, highly desirable tool that's much more about self-expression,” claims Carleysmith. Collaborations are helping to underline this “style” narrative, too, with the likes of Barbour, Palace Skateboarding, Liberty London, Tour de France, LINE Friends, and art collaborations with Crew Nation and cultural luminaries including Radiohead, Phoebe Bridgers, and LCD Soundsystem. But like any good 50th birthday, there have been both happy and sad tears. During Covid lockdown, demand increased five-fold, but as a result of supply chain and shipping bottlenecks, rising costs, and heavy investment in new designs, pretax profits plunged by 99 percent to just $6,335 (£4,602, or roughly the cost of a single Brompton T-Line One Speed) for the year ending March 31, 2024. It's not the only cycling brand faced with post-Covid cash flow issues, but rather than being stuck with excess stock, its financial woes have been thanks to a global drop in demand and heavy investment, first with the Brompton Electric range and the bigger, 20-inch all-terrain G Line, which WIRED tested at launch. Brompton folding bikes are now sold in 47 countries, yet the design remains practically unchanged since the original patent was filed in 1979, one that has long since expired. This multifunctional bike, deliberately designed to tempt the small (10 percent) but growing US audience, offers compact convenience that can finally escape the city. “With the G Line, you can genuinely ride it off-road,” says Carleysmith. “We purposely made it look bigger and more capable, too, but still with the Brompton fundamentals.” Tern offers a range of electric, cargo, and folding bikes, including the impressively compact 20-inch BYB (from $1,849). Its latest design is the K-Feather, a 26-pound folding ebike with built-in battery that costs just $1,199. Hand-built in Oregon, Bike Friday has 12 distinctly different folding designs, including a tandem. And then there's the influx of Chinese brands such as Fiido, HIMO (by Xiaomi), and Engwe all offering folding electric options at low pricing. But being Brompton, and being well versed in doing things differently, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, its R&D budget is being spent on developing its own proprietary electric bike platform, bringing together technical improvements, connectivity, batteries, and motors, so they can continue to innovate around their original folding mechanism. As for the new 30-year-old Brompton, the titanium parts have stripped away excess weight, it folds as smoothly as any new design we've tested, and despite having 12 gears, it's easy enough to carry on public transport, and impressively nippy to ride. The big question for this writer is whether he will be able to get another upgrade in time for his ruby wedding anniversary.
