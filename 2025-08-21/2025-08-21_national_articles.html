Former federal prosecutor Jim Trusty discusses Tulsi Gabbard's referral of Russia probe evidence to the Department of Justice and Alina Habba's ongoing efforts to stay on as Acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey after her interim term expired. A judge on Thursday found that Alina Habba was unlawfully serving in the role of acting U.S. attorney of New Jersey after President Donald Trump sidestepped typical processes to keep her in charge. Judge Matthew Brann said Habba has not been the rightful temporary U.S. attorney for New Jersey since July 1, a ruling that follows two criminal defendants in New Jersey challenging her appointment in court, alleging it was unconstitutional. Alina Habba, newly appointed interim US attorney for New Jersey, speaks to members of the media outside the West Wing of the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Monday, March 24, 2025. Habba, Trump's former personal defense lawyer, had been serving as interim U.S. attorney, but when her term expired last month, Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi used loopholes in federal vacancy laws to install her as "acting" rather than "interim" U.S. attorney. President Donald Trump listens as White House Presidential Counselor Alina Habba delivers remarks before being sworn in as the interim U.S. Attorney for New Jersey in the Oval Office at the White House on March 28, 2025 in Washington, DC. Brann, an Obama appointee serving in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, agreed and found Habba could not prosecute Giraud or another defendant who challenged Habba's position. Brann is presiding over the matter after the chief judge of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers New Jersey and Pennsylvania, decided the case presented too much of a conflict for New Jersey's federal judges. The New Jersey judges made the rare decision to decline to extend Habba's term and instead appointed career attorney Desiree Grace to the job. Trump and Bondi fired Grace, withdrew Habba's nomination as permanent U.S. attorney and then reinstated Habba as acting U.S. attorney, which they said kept Habba in charge for at least another 210 days under federal statute.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump speaks at the Kennedy Center, Wednesday, Aug. 13, 2025, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department said Thursday that it's reviewing the records of more than 55 million foreigners who hold valid U.S. visas for potential revocation or deportable violations of immigration rules. In a written answer to a question posed by The Associated Press, the department said that all U.S. visa holders are subject to “continuous vetting” with an eye toward any indication that they could be ineligible for the document. The department said it was looking for indicators of ineligibility, including visa overstays, criminal activity, threats to public safety, engaging in any form of terrorist activity, or providing support to a terrorist organization. “We review all available information as part of our vetting, including law enforcement or immigration records or any other information that comes to light after visa issuance indicating a potential ineligibility,” the department said. Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has thus far focused on deporting migrants illegally in the United States as well as holders of student and visitor exchange visas. The administration has steadily imposed more and more restrictions and requirements on visa applicants, including requiring all visa seekers to submit to in-person interviews. But the review of all visa holders appears to be a significant expansion of what had initially been a re-vetting process focused mainly on students who have been involved in pro-Palestinian or anti-Israel activity. Officials say the reviews will include all the visa holders' social media accounts, law enforcement and immigration records in their home countries, along with any actionable violations of U.S. law committed while they were in the United States. “As part of the Trump Administration's commitment to protect U.S. national security and public safety, since Inauguration Day the State Department has revoked more than twice as many visas, including nearly four times as many student visas, as during the same time period last year,” the department said. Earlier this week, the department said that since Trump returned to the White House, it has revoked more than 6,000 student visas for overstays and violations of local, state and federal law, the vast majority of which were assault, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and support for terrorism. It said that about 4,000 of those 6,000 were due to actual infractions of laws and that approximately 200–300 visas were revoked for terrorism-related issues, including providing support for designated terrorist organizations or state sponsors of terrorism.</p>

Twenty Judge Advocate General (JAG) attorneys, part of the legal branch of the U.S. military, have been assigned to prosecute civilian cases in Washington, D.C. as the Trump administration continues its crackdown on crime. "The assignment of 20 JAGs to my office is further proof of President Trump's commitment to fighting and reducing crime in the district," U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said in a statement. Members of the National Guard facilitate entries at the staging area of local and federal law enforcement agencies inside the U.S. Park Police Anacostia Operations Facility on Aug. 12, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Craig Hudson For The Washington Post via Getty Images) President Donald Trump federalized police in D.C. on Aug. 11 as high levels of crime continued to plague the city. "I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in Washington, D.C.," Trump told reporters when making the announcement. There have been no homicides in D.C. since Aug. 13, just two days after the announcement, the Metropolitan Police Department confirmed Thursday morning. Approximately 800 National Guard troops have been deployed to the city so far, and federal law enforcement has also swarmed the city to combat crime. The FBI and Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) conduct a traffic stop near the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Thursday morning that since Trump's initiative began, 630 people have been arrested by federal law enforcement. "Our mission to make DC safe again isn't slowing down," she said. FBI Director Kash Patel touted the recent arrests, too. "FBI joined federal partners in 31 more arrests last night," Patel said Thursday morning. Those arrests included six illegal firearm recoveries, seven drug seizures, and charges including theft, assault with a deadly weapon, drug offenses, assault on an officer and unlawful entry. "This is a team effort across multiple federal partners — they're working around the clock to get it done and your capital city is safer every day because of it," Patel said.

Millie Bobby Brown, left, and Jake Bongiovi arrive at the premiere of “The Electric State” on Monday, Feb. 24, 2025, at The Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. LOS ANGELES (AP) — Millie Bobby Brown and Jake Bongiovi adopted a daughter, the first child for the married couple, this summer, they announced Thursday. “We are beyond excited to embark on this beautiful next chapter of parenthood in both peace and privacy,” the couple wrote in a social media statement. Representatives for Brown and Bongiovi did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for comment. Brown gained recognition for her starring role as Eleven in the Duffer brothers' sci-fi series “Stranger Things.” The fifth and final season will air this November and December, a culmination of nine years of the show's production. The British actor has pursued other acting and business ventures in that time, including the Netflix original “Enola Holmes” films and a “Godzilla” film. She even released a romance book in 2023. Bongiovi is the son of Jon Bon Jovi, founder and frontman of the rock band Bon Jovi. Bongiovi debuted his own acting career as the star in “Rockbottom,” which released last year. Brown stressed the importance of family during the 2024 premiere of her Netflix film “Damsel,” where Bongiovi and his parents were in attendance. “I'm just so lucky that they're here tonight and it just means so much to me,” Brown told The Associated Press then. She recently told the AP she enjoys living on a farm, largely disconnected from social media, while promoting her 2025 Netflix film “The Electric State.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PSA Airlines flight attendants hold placards during a demonstration at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Monday, August 18, 2025, in Washington. Sara Nelson, the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, holds placard during a demonstration at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Monday, August 18, 2025, in Washington. PSA Airlines flight attendants hold placards during a demonstration at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Monday, August 18, 2025, in Washington. At the end of work trips, Nathan Miller goes home to a makeshift bedroom in his parents' house in Virginia. The 29-year-old flight attendant is part of a PSA Airlines crew based in Philadelphia, but Miller says he can't afford to live there. He makes about $24,000 a year working full-time for the American Airlines subsidiary. Despite often staffing multiple flights a day, Miller commutes by plane between Virginia Beach and Philadelphia International Airport, a distance of about 215 miles. It's not something that I want to do,” Miller, who joined PSA two years ago, said. Frustrations among flight attendants at both regional and legacy airlines have been building for years over paychecks that many of them say don't match the weight of what their jobs demand. Air Canada's flight attendants put a public spotlight on these simmering issues when about 10,000 of them walked off the job last weekend, forcing the airline to cancel more than 3,000 flights. The strike ended Tuesday with a tentative deal that includes wage increases and, for the first time, pay for boarding passengers. In the United States, however, the nearly century-old Railway Labor Act makes it far more difficult for union flight attendants like Miller, a member of the Association of Flight Attendants, to strike than most other American workers. Unlike the Boeing factory workers and Hollywood writers and actors who collectively stopped work in recent years, U.S. airline workers can only strike if federal mediators declare an impasse — and even then, the president or Congress can intervene. For that reason, airline strikes are exceedingly rare. The last major one in the U.S. was over a decade ago by Spirit Airlines pilots, and most attempts since then have failed. American Airlines flight attendants tried in 2023 but were blocked by mediators. Without the ultimate bargaining chip, airline labor unions have seen their power eroded in contract talks that now stretch far beyond historical norms, according to Sara Nelson, the international president of the AFA. Negotiations that once took between a year and 18 months now drag on for three years, sometimes more. On Monday, she joined PSA flight attendants in protest outside Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, near where an airliner operated by PSA crashed into the Potomac River in January after colliding with an Army helicopter. The airline's flight attendants also demonstrated outside three other U.S. airports. Flight attendants say their jobs have become more demanding in recent years. Customers may see them mostly as uniforms that serve food and beverages, but the many hats attendants juggle include handling in-flight emergencies, deescalating conflicts and managing unruly passengers. We're trained to evacuate a plane in 90 seconds, and we're always the last ones off,” said Becky Black, a PSA flight attendant in Dayton, Ohio, who is part of the union's negotiating team. And yet, Black says, their pay hasn't kept pace. At American, flight attendants began negotiations on a new contract in 2020 but didn't get one until 2024. Southwest Airlines attendants pushed even longer — over five years — before securing a new deal last year that delivered an immediate 22% wage hike and annual 3% increases through 2027. “Coming out of COVID, where you saw prices were high and individuals struggling, it really meant something.” A mother of two, Head said she returned to work “fairly quickly” after having her first child because she couldn't afford to stay home. “Now, new parents don't have to make that same hard decision,” she said. Many of her peers at other airlines are still waiting for their new contracts. At United, attendants rejected a tentative agreement last month, with 71% voting no. While Delta became the first U.S. airline to offer it in 2022 — followed by American and Alaska — many flight attendants still aren't compensated during what they call the busiest part of their shift. Back in Virginia Beach, Miller is still trying to make it work. On family vacations during his childhood, Miller said he was fascinated by flight attendants and their ability to make people feel comfortable and safe.</p>

While the weather remains warm, food trucks across the U.S. are thriving – but a deadly outbreak overseas may give consumers pause. In Italy, two people recently died in a botulism outbreak linked to a food truck, according to The Telegraph. Fourteen others were hospitalized, all in the Calabria region. The victims, Luigi di Sarno, 52, and Tamara D'Acunto, 45, passed away after eating sandwiches made of sausage and rapini, also known as turnip greens. Their deaths raise a question for many: Are food trucks riskier than restaurants? Dr. Michael Policastro told Fox News Digital that botulism is very rare. Victims in Italy ate sausage and rapini sandwiches (not pictured) that were later linked to a fatal botulism outbreak. "In the U.S., most cases actually come from home-canned goods or improperly preserved foods – not commercial kitchens," the Arizona-based doctor said. "Food trucks work with limited prep space, smaller refrigeration units and intense heat from cooking in tight quarters." "I've seen occasional reports from overseas involving street vendors, but here, there's no solid evidence that food trucks are riskier than restaurants." "Food trucks work with limited prep space, smaller refrigeration units and intense heat from cooking in tight quarters," he said. "If those factors aren't managed well, the risk [of] any foodborne illness goes up, including botulism." A doctor revealed some potential risks that are associated with food trucks. "Beyond food safety, there are also physical risks – fires, propane issues, even accidents around the truck in crowded areas," Policastro said. He said that botulism typically manifests in home-canned vegetables or meats, along with garlic or vegetables stored in oil. Other culprits can include baked potatoes wrapped in foil, smoked or fermented fish, certain sausages and cheese sauces, Policastro noted. Food trucks can lack water for handwashing compared to restaurants, creating another layer of food safety concern, say some medical experts. He added that botulism can be fatal without treatment and typically shows itself 12 to 36 hours after someone consumes contaminated food. "Early on, people might notice weakness, fatigue, blurred vision or trouble speaking and swallowing," Policastro said. In severe cases, it reaches the respiratory muscles, and you can't breathe without help. Some people also have nausea, vomiting or abdominal bloating." An antitoxin can halt the spread of nerve damage in botulism patients, but immediate hospital care is still essential, as it cannot reverse damage already done, Policastro said. Jennifer Behm-Lazzarini, a "Master Chef" winner and owner of food truck L'Ocean Eats, told Fox News Digital that hygiene starts "with sanitizing the trailer after every use." Hygiene starts "with sanitizing the trailer after every use," said one food truck owner (not pictured). Behm-Lazzarini, who travels across the Northeast with her food truck, said that it's crucial to keep serving utensils sanitized and to switch out gloves regularly while touching food. "Equally important is temperature control, maintaining cold, frozen and hot temperatures of products from the time of procurement to the guests' hands," she said. "Enjoy that taco or sandwich," a doctor said, "but pay attention to how the vendor operates."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Atlantic is announcing four new members of its editorial staff: Emily Bobrow and Katie Zezima will join as senior editors, both as part of the politics, global, and ideas team; Will Gottsegen was hired as a staff writer for The Atlantic's flagship newsletter, The Daily; and Jonathan Lemire, who has reported extensively on the Trump administration this year as a contributing writer, becomes a staff writer. More details from our editors about all four journalists follow: She comes to us from The Wall Street Journal, where she is a features editor and reporter for the Review section, and where she has gained a wonderful reputation as a creative, thoughtful and supportive editor, commissioning and editing some of the Journal's most widely read pieces. Previously she wrote the Journal's Weekend Confidential column. Some of you may recall that Emily has also contributed to our pages, writing for the Family section on how the pandemic would put marriage even further out of reach for many Americans. Katie Zezima is joining us after 11 years at The Washington Post, where she earned a similarly wonderful reputation for her wise stewardship of some of the paper's most ambitious work. Katie has led coverage on a variety of subjects, but her focus lately has been nature's wrath: hurricanes, droughts, fires, and the rising seas. Katie joined the Post as a White House correspondent during the Obama Administration and she later hit the presidential campaign trail, traveling to 33 states with GOP candidates, all running doomed campaigns against a political neophyte. He started with us as a contributing writer in January and has since published an impressive number of timely reports, taking readers inside the Trump administration's thinking, making a specialty of reporting on the president's foreign policy and a subspecialty of the Trump-Putin relationship. Will Gottsegen is joining as a staff writer on the newsletters team. You'll likely recognize Will's byline from the excellent writing he's already done for us in recent years. He's explained Donald Trump's fixation on crypto to our readers, interviewed Sam Bankman-Fried weeks before his arrest, and catalogued SBF's downfall. Will started his journalism career as a music critic and has been on staff at CoinDesk, Billboard, and SPIN. The clarity, humor, and sharpness of Will's writing make him a perfect fit for his new role as a Daily writer, where he will work alongside the indispensable David A. Graham to guide our newsletter readers through the biggest ideas and news of the day. Recently announced editorial hires at The Atlantic include staff writers Tom Bartlett, Tyler Austin Harper, Anna Holmes, Sally Jenkins, Quinta Jurecic, Idrees Kahloon, Jake Lundberg, Toluse Olorunnipa, Alexandra Petri, Missy Ryan, Vivian Salama, Jamie Thompson, Josh Tyrangiel, and Nancy Youssef; and senior editors Drew Goins, Jenna Johnson, and Dan Zak.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Earlier this month, a fundraiser for nonprofits that fight to end factory farming went a little viral — at least in one corner of the internet. Dwarkesh Patel, the influential tech podcaster, announced on his show that if his listeners donated a collective $250,000 to FarmKind, an organization that distributes money to anti-factory farming charities, so would he. So far, Patel and his listeners — including Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, professional poker player Liv Boeree, and popular Substack writer Noah Smith — have raised over $2 million. The movement spent around $260 million last year in its effort to help tens of billions of abused land animals and a trillion or so fish (to put that into perspective, New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art spends far more annually to collect, store, and display art). His pitch was simple: This is a really big problem, and charities have been able to make meaningful progress on it with little money, so by injecting even a relatively modest amount of extra funds into the cause, you can make a big difference. The organization that will distribute the money, FarmKind, makes the same pitch, but with a twist that Patel only hinted at: If you feel bad about eating meat but don't want to go vegan, you can have the same impact by donating to charity instead. “It's like carbon offsets, but for your diet,” FarmKind's website states. (Carbon offsets allow people to pay for an environmental good — like planting trees that absorb carbon dioxide — to offset a high carbon-emitting activity, like traveling by airplane.) Most people think the factory farms that produce the vast majority of America's meat, eggs, and dairy are bad, but decades of vegan advocacy have failed to persuade more than 1 percent of Americans. Calls to just eat less meat have proven largely ineffective, too. If sympathetic consumers are unwilling to change their diets, the thinking goes, they could still help by supporting cash-strapped organizations working to reduce animal suffering on farms and make plant-based eating more accessible. But I also worry that FarmKind's approach, known as “moral offsetting,” might absolve consumers — who individually and collectively hold power to reduce the number of animals factory-farmed for food — of personal responsibility. So, can you actually offset your meat consumption with a donation? This doesn't mean that if you donate $23 per month, you save 269.5 animals or guarantee that someone else will go vegetarian in your stead. Rather, FarmKind estimates that, with an extra $23 per month, the animal advocacy charities that receive your money can reduce animal suffering by an amount equivalent to the suffering experienced by 269.5 animals on factory farms. Animal advocacy groups have successfully pressured hundreds of corporations, along with many state governments, to ban these cages. One of the leading cage-free advocacy groups, the Humane League, estimates that for every 85 cents they spend on these campaigns, they manage to get one hen out of a cage. Animal welfare experts have estimated that one-third of an egg-laying hen's total suffering can be attributed to their confinement in cages. FarmKind uses similar analyses that attempt to quantify the suffering of pigs kept in tiny cages, and the suffering inflicted by other cruel practices on factory farms. The organization acknowledges that there's a degree of uncertainty in these calculations, and it uses more conservative estimates to account for it. And there are more fundamentally unknowable questions — like, given that we don't know what it's like to be a chicken, do we really know that cage confinement accounts for one-third of a hen's suffering? There are more practical unknowns, too, like whether a charity that has been effective in the past will be effective in the future — after years of success, their campaigns may hit diminishing returns. It's easy to dismiss these uncertainties as misleading, and I could further quibble with FarmKind's calculations. But what is clear is that the resource-poor anti-factory farming movement could make a lot more progress with more money, whether it's labeled an “offset” or not. FarmKind's answer to that question is an unequivocal “yes,” and it's one rooted in ruthless pragmatism. “We know that people overall are actually really on board with the idea that factory farming in particular is terrible,” Norman of FarmKind told me. And animal advocacy groups tend to give consumers one thing they can do to help: reduce or eliminate their meat consumption. And while many people say they're actively reducing their meat intake, most are probably lying or fooling themselves. American per capita meat consumption has increased in recent years. But in the world we've got, the next best thing, according to Norman, is to enrich the animal advocacy movement so that it can win more campaigns to reduce animal suffering on factory farms. As to whether meat offsets let people off the hook, morally speaking, Norman said he's uncertain. He doesn't know whether donating might make people who otherwise would've reduced their meat consumption refrain from doing so or even increase their consumption. But he says that people donating to FarmKind aren't deciding between going vegan or donating to offset their meat consumption. '” Norman said Plus, he added, getting people to donate as a first step might make them feel a part of the movement and lead them to take other actions, like eating less meat or volunteering. I posed the question of offsets to Tyler John, a philosopher and philanthropic advisor who's thought deeply about animal ethics, philanthropy, and carbon offsetting. But whether or not that can truly offset an individual's meat consumption, he said, is “a very complicated empirical question.” He worries that the idea of meat offsets could further reinforce how little humans value the lives of animals raised and slaughtered for food. Few people would consider it morally sound to abuse a dog and offset that harm by donating to an animal shelter, but this is essentially what meat offsetting entails. “It's only in cases where we're morally disengaged and don't care that much about the moral issue that we think offsetting is okay.” We also can't “offset our way out” of the factory farming problem, John said, because even if everyone were to offset their meat consumption, the meat industry would still raise and slaughter tens of billions of animals — albeit in modestly better conditions — every year. When I first learned about FarmKind, I instinctively winced at the idea that the suffering of farmed animals could be offset with a donation equivalent to a monthly Netflix subscription. Billions of animals are trapped in cages — their tails, testicles, and beaks cut off with no pain relief — and overcrowded into noxious warehouses, forced to live in their own waste. But, then, I think about how the project to end factory farming, drastically reduce meat consumption, and shift the world toward a more plant-based food system will likely be a centuries-long one, and I can see meat offsets in another light. What is in reach is reducing the suffering of animals unlucky enough to be born into the factory farm system and slowly normalizing plant-based eating. But those can only be achieved by a bigger, better resourced, more powerful animal advocacy movement. A sympathetic public could, at the very least, chip in to build that movement, and the success of Dwarkesh Patel's fundraiser suggests there are a lot of people eager to help in this way. I don't know if you can truly offset the suffering and death of one animal on a factory farm by making many others suffer a little less. You then have to meet them where they are, which is painfully far from what animals need. A few years ago, carbon offset expert John Holler told Vox that it's more helpful to think of carbon offsets as simply “a tool for routing money toward good things,” like green energy and forest conservation, rather than as a true offset of your own carbon footprint. “You're purchasing carbon credits to contribute to global decarbonization,” he said, “not making a claim against your own emissions.” We should think about meat offsets in the same way.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A longtime ally and adviser to New York City Mayor Eric Adams was suspended after she attempted to give a reporter a bag of potato chips stuffed with cash. Adams campaign adviser Winnie Greco gave a Herr's Sour Cream & Onion ripple potato chip filled with cash to a reporter from local news outlet the City. The reporter, Katie Honan, said she initially refused to take the bag of chips, but Greco had insisted. Inside the bag, Honan said she found at least one $100 bill and several $20 bills. In a later interview with the outlet, Greco began to profusely apologize. She then referred the news outlet to her attorney. “I can see how this looks strange,” Greco's attorney, Steven Brill, told the City. “But I assure you that Winnie's intent was purely innocent. In the Chinese culture, money is often given to others in a gesture of friendship and gratitude. Winnie is apologetic and embarrassed by any negative impression or confusion this may have caused.” “Grecco [sic] holds no position in this campaign and has been suspended from all VOLUNTEER campaign-related activities,” Todd Shapiro, a spokesperson for Adams's reelection campaign, said in a statement, adding that the team was “shocked” by the gift. Greco has been a close adviser to the mayor for over a decade, first starting to volunteer for him after he was Brooklyn borough president in 2013. She resigned as city's director of Asian Affairs last year after being caught up in the federal law enforcement investigation into Adams. The FBI raided two of her homes in connection with their investigation into a straw donations scheme in Adams's 2021 mayoral campaign. Adams is running for reelection as an independent. “The fact that one of mayor Adams' closest, longtime advisors would attempt to ingratiate herself to any reporter, much less Katie Honan, with a cash gift is deeply disturbing and speaks to a rampant and blatant disregard for the role of a free and fair press,” Kim said. “The choice of sour cream and onion chips is also questionable,” he added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? But do you really want to run your household like a small business? There are things you can do to prepare yourself for parenthood: Read the books, take the classes, set up a college fund. More specifically, nobody tells you how hard it is to keep up with the logistical demands and bureaucratic bloat. So it's no surprise that a cottage industry has cropped up to support those fledgling families using a range of tools borrowed from work culture. Offering everything from AI-powered assistants to wall-mounted touchscreens, these tech companies promise to provide your family with its own command center or operating system — a software-based solution to the societal problem of parenting while overwhelmed. A 2025 report from the Office of the Surgeon General showed that nearly half of American parents said that “most days their stress is completely overwhelming.” Women tend to carry more of the mental load. The vast majority of parents in opposite-sex households say the mother spends more time managing schedules, according to a Pew Research Center poll published in 2023. A separate study found that mothers, on average, did 71 percent of the cognitive labor at home — child care, cleaning, scheduling, finances, managing relationships — while men did just 29 percent. It's no surprise that a cottage industry has cropped up to support those fledgling families using a range of tools borrowed from work culture. “This work of organizing the family is work, and it's falling on women, particularly in different-sex couples,” said Allison Daminger, an assistant sociology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and author of the upcoming book What's on Her Mind: The Mental Load of Family Life. The cost of child care has steadily increased in recent years, and most working parents do not have access to paid family leave. An app won't solve these policy challenges, but it might make a tired parent's day slightly more streamlined. They can help people manage, keep their heads above water, but the real solutions we need are much bigger than any app.” That was my experience trying out many of these new tools. The touchscreen in my kitchen is not paying for pre-school. However, I'm in no position to run for Congress and champion the cause, because I still have to make a pediatrician appointment, schedule a playdate, and plan the next week's worth of family meals. And we learned the hard way that just creating a new Google Calendar wasn't going to cut it, where family obligations get mixed in with work meetings and personal to-dos, turning the whole thing into a soup of confusion. That led me to check out dedicated family calendar apps, like Maple, before exploring full fledged family command centers, like Skylight. The idea of using software to help families stay organized is not new. Some 20 years ago, a couple of former Microsoft employees created an online family organizer called Cozi, which is still around today. I'm in no position to run for Congress and champion the cause, because I still have to make a pediatrician appointment, schedule a playdate, and plan the next week's worth of family meals. The 27-inch Cal Max, launched last year, costs up to $600, plus an additional $80 a year for access to all the features. Hot on Skylight's heels is an app called Maple, which launched in February 2021. Initially described as “the back office of every family,” Maple has gone through a few iterations, including one that enabled parents to sell “ready made plans” to other families, but the app is primarily a family calendar powered by to-do lists. You can create to-dos, assign them to members of the family, and then see a schedule of everything that needs to be done. It costs $40 a year to sync external calendars, get rid of ads, and access AI features. I know what you're thinking: Google and Apple software can do a lot of this stuff for free. Just last year, the New York Times spoke to a number of parents, many of whom worked in the venture capital or crypto industries, that use project management tools like Trello and Notion to run their families like startups. “Tasks and chores, to-do lists, grocery lists: There are apps that do those individual things better than we do,” Michael Segal, co-founder and CEO of Skylight, said in an interview. “It's just more convenient to do it all in the place where you go to manage the family and home.” Michael Perry, Maple's co-founder and CEO, similarly told me that his company's job is “building a calendar that's all encompassing for seven days a week of our life as a working parent.” Maple also invites its users to join a Slack community, where they can weigh in on features they love or hate or check out upcoming releases, like Maple's new web app, which is set to launch this fall. Hearth sells its own giant touchscreen calendar for your kitchen, and Jam looks like a Maple clone with some Gen Z design flair. Apps like Milo and Ohai lean into the AI of it all, promising to use chatbots to keep your family organized. There are also tech companies trying to connect parents. Honeycomb says it helps parents “share the mental and logistical load” via group chats and smart calendars, and the Sandwich Club is an AI-powered advice platform that lets other parents weigh in on your questions. Together, these companies comprise a burgeoning new industry, referred to as famtech. There's even an industry association dedicated to promoting its interests, drumming up investment, and pushing for policy changes for caregivers, like paid family leave. “Liken it to where financial services has fintech, we look at the care economy as having famtech as its innovation sector,” said Anna Steffany, executive director of FamTech.org, “and we look at family technology as all things addressing the caregiving space.” One trend report, which Steffany contributed to, values the care economy at nearly $650 billion. Heck, I've been using both for a few weeks now, and it's certainly nice not to have to text my wife every time there's a change in the schedule or to remind me who's on preschool pickup duty that day. Then again, I'm also starting to wonder if using a parenting app just means I'm giving up more data about my family in the services of better targeted ads. I'm also acutely aware that having a new tool to manage my family means I've got yet another thing to manage. “When you're trying to integrate across so many different apps and systems and interfaces, the real cost benefit ratio can get thrown off,” said Daminger, the UW-Madison professor. “Sometimes we're trying to make things easier, but in the end, we actually end up just creating new forms of labor.” A version of this story was also published in the User Friendly newsletter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The White House is pressing Senate Republicans to confirm an ally of President Donald Trump to the Federal Reserve board in time for its next meeting in mid-September, when members will decide whether to slash interest rates for the first time this year. Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN) on Wednesday was the latest lawmaker to speak with Miran, and before that, he met with Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) and Sen. Jim Banks (R-IN). Meetings with additional committee members are planned in the coming days, according to a White House official who said the administration “has been working aggressively” to move Miran's confirmation forward. “With the president's strong backing, we look forward to advancing his confirmation process in September.” Economists are generally predicting the Fed will slash its rates. A senior Senate GOP aide said Republicans will prioritize nominees at the White House's direction and noted that Republicans are considering rules changes to expedite the process for all nominees following Democratic roadblocks this summer that have held up dozens of Trump nominees. Banking panel Republicans, in addition to administration officials, are envisioning a prioritized approval process, raising the potential for an abnormally quick confirmation. Hagerty told the Washington Examiner in a statement that Miran should receive “swift confirmation.” Banks, who huddled with Miran Tuesday at the White House, has said Senate Republicans need to confirm him “ASAP before the Fed's September meeting.” Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH), speaking to reporters earlier this month, also envisioned a September timeline while conveying constituent frustration over elevated interest rates. “Every single stop, question one, two, or three was about why we haven't lowered interest rates, which was very validating,” Moreno told the Washington Examiner of his interactions back in Ohio. The Fed is expected to cut rates by 0.25% at next month's meeting after recent major downward revisions in job reports showed a worse-than-expected labor market. But inflation concerns persist, particularly as Trump leans further into his tariff agenda. If confirmed, Miran would fill the seat of Adriana Kugler, who resigned earlier this month. Powell's term as Fed Reserve chairman expires in May 2026, but his time on the board itself runs through January 2028.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis superstar Coco Gauff has parted ways with her coach just days before this year's US Open, according to reports, including ESPN, on Wednesday. The two-time grand slam singles winner has not publicly announced the decision, but reports suggest coach Matthew Daly will no longer be part of her team. CNN Sports has reached out to Gauff's representatives for comment. “Only have good things to say about Coco, enjoyed working with her,” Daly told Bounces, adding that the decision was made “recently.” Reports state that Gauff will continue working with her longtime coach Jean-Christophe Faurel, while also bringing in biomechanics specialist Gavin MacMillan. 3 was seen practicing with her new coaching team in New York this week, according to Reuters, with particular attention being paid to her serve and forehand. Coco Gauff reacts to winning the French Open MacMillan, who works across various sports, has been widely credited for helping current world No. Serving has been a problem area for Gauff in recent months, with the American hitting 42 double faults in just three matches at the Canadian Open earlier this month, according to Reuters. Under the partnership of Daly and Faurel, though, Gauff produced some of her best tennis, winning both last year's WTA Finals and this year's French Open. Gauff will look to rectify her dip in performance at this year's US Open, where she won the 2023 edition and will be one of the biggest stars in the draw.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's believed to store up to nine nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) as well as their mobile launchers, said the report by Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). The site is one of the estimated 15 to 20 ballistic missile bases and warhead storage facilities that North Korea has never declared, said the report, which drew from satellite image analysis, interviews with North Korean refugees and officials, declassified documents and open-source data. North Korea has ramped up its weapons program in the last few years under leader Kim Jong Un, rapidly modernizing its armed forces, developing new weapons and testing intercontinental ballistic missiles that can reach almost anywhere in the United States. Those actions are in violation of United Nations sanctions that strictly limit North Korea's access to materials and weapons. But the isolated nation has also ramped up its cooperation with Russia since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, sending troops to fight on the frontlines – raising fears that Moscow could help boost Pyongyang's technologies and supply lines in return. Why Trump's strikes on Iran will leave North Korea more determined than ever to keep its nukes This secret base is part of North Korea's effort to bolster its nuclear program, the report said. The base sits in a narrow mountain valley, cut in half by a stream, and measures 22 square kilometers (about 5,436 acres) – bigger than New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Experts say that its location near the border lends a geographical advantage – countries like the United States might be wary of targeting it since any fallout could impact adjacent China. “By building bases so close to China, North Korea may also seek to leverage the political risk and uncertainty of Beijing's response in order to deter an attack,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. “US and South Korean policymakers are already aware of Pyongyang's unwillingness to trade away these capabilities in disarmament diplomacy, but public knowledge of such bases might prompt more Chinese observers to resent North Korean attempts at strategic entanglement,” he added. Since then, the base has been “well-maintained” and continues to be actively developed – potentially reflecting ongoing advancements in North Korea's missile testing, it said. It's not yet clear what model of ballistic missile is stored at the base – but CSIS researchers believe it's equipped with North Korea's nuclear-capable Hwasong-15 or Hwasong-18 ICBMS, or a different type of ICBM that has not yet been revealed. “During times of crisis or war, these launchers and missiles will exit the base, meet special warhead storage/transportation units, and conduct launch operations from dispersed pre-surveyed sites,” the report said. The report also included satellite imagery that pointed out the base's many facilities, including entrance checkpoints, headquarter buildings, warehouses, missile support facilities and small housing buildings. North Korea's Kim Jong Un threatens to destroy the South with nuclear weapons if provoked Some of these have been deliberately covered with trees and bushes to conceal their entrances – making them difficult to locate in satellite images except for winter “when vegetation is sparse,” the report said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They roll down Beijing streets, some covered from prying eyes by huge tarpaulins, but the silhouettes of missiles, tanks and undersea vehicles are unmistakable as China prepares for its most revealing military parade in six years. For military watchers, the procession of veiled armaments is offering valuable clues to what might be on show at a massive military parade on September 3, which China says will reveal the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) “new generation” of domestically produced, active-duty weaponry. The 2019 parade saw the PLA unveil weapons including a road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile, a medium-range ballistic missile mated with a hypersonic glide vehicle, and its first undersea drone. Beijing has pursued a head-turning military buildup under Chinese leader Xi Jinping, during which the PLA – previously not even one of the strongest in Asia – has started to rival, or in some categories surpass, the US military in analysts' estimations. On September 3 military watchers are expecting new versions of some of the weaponry and technology that debuted in 2019. Parade rehearsals have shown what are almost certainly new types of hypersonic missile systems and huge undersea drones among other weaponry, masked by tarpaulins and fabric coverings. “The parade involves more than 10,000 personnel, over a hundred aircraft, and several hundred ground vehicles,” Maj. Gen. Xu Guizhong, executive deputy director of the Parade Command Office of the PLA's Central Theater Command, told a briefing in Beijing. More than 100 different types of equipment will be included, all of it battle ready and domestically produced, Xu said, adding that a large proportion would be new armaments making their debut. The general ticked off a range of China's most modern weaponry that it's never shown the world before: cutting-edge drones, directed-energy weapons, electronic jamming systems, hypersonic systems, air-defense and missile-defense technologies, and strategic missiles. The plans seem to satisfy the wish list of one Chinese citizen CNN spoke to as speculation swirled in recent days. “I'd like to see whether there will be some drone displays, or how the different troops will present themselves in different orders. I'd also be interested in our military strength, such as tanks,” said Liu Hongmei, a tourist from Yunnan province who was visiting Beijing. Comments on the micro-blogging platform Weibo reflected strong enthusiasm for the upcoming parade, with many people asking for a national holiday so they could catch it on TV. “Can we get a day off to watch the live broadcast?” one poster asked, getting more than 2,000 likes. China's aircraft carriers send message in the open Pacific for the first time – and bigger and more powerful ships are coming “I'm definitely taking a day off to watch on September 3, canceling all my plans,” another wrote. That's not enough to watch!” one post said. The PLA has promised more details to come in the weeks before September 3, when it won't only be residents of China who are tuning in for an update on the country's military arsenal. “As for the specific models of the showcased equipment, please stay tuned; more information will be available soon,” Xu told Wednesday's press briefing.</p>
