            Walmart is getting hit by tariffs, like every other business in America. But customers are still flocking to Walmart because they believe the retailer offers them the biggest bang for their buck.
    


            The retail behemoth once again on Thursday showed how it uses its size to dominate the industry. Its economies of scale help keep prices as low as possible, even as Trump's tariffs raise costs. Walmart also relies on its strength in groceries and necessities to win over shoppers looking for discounts. More than half of Walmart's sales come from groceries.
    


            Walmart said Thursday that sales at US stores open for at least a year jumped 4.8%, and it gained market share across income groups, led by growth with upper-income households. The company also raised its sales outlook for the year.
    


            CEO Doug McMillon said that tariffs have created pressures for the company and its seeing its “costs increase each week.” But it's keeping prices down “for as long as we can.”
    


            Customers have not made major shifts to their purchasing behavior because of tariffs, he said, but some middle and lower-income households have stopped buying some discretionary products that have gone up in prices.
    


            “Value is still en vogue. That's the key message from Walmart,” Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients. “Broad consumer and macro trends remain favorable to Walmart.”
    


            Still, Walmart's stock fell 3% during pre-market trading. The company missed analysts' profit forecasts. Heading into Thursday, Walmart's stock had increased 36%.
    


            Walmart is surging ahead of its rivals, such as Target and Home Depot. Target, in particular, is in a funk and its CEO is stepping down.
    


            Target on Wednesday reported sales fell for the third consecutive quarter. Shares tumbled 6%. Target has been one of the worst-performing stocks on the S&P 500.
    


            Target CEO Brian Cornell is stepping down after 11 years at the retailer, as the company faces slumping sales and backlash to its retreat on DEI. He will be replaced early next year by Michael Fiddelke, Target's current chief operating officer. Some investors and analysts criticized the move, arguing Target should have hired an outside voice to lead the company.
    


            The company's business is falling behind Walmart because it stocks more non-essential goods such as home decor than Walmart. Many shoppers, strained by inflation over the past several years, are buying fewer discretionary products and focusing on essentials.
    


            Target also imports about half of its merchandise, compared to roughly 33% at Walmart, so it needs to raise prices at almost double the rate of Walmart to mitigate the tariff impact, Bank of America analyst Robert Ohmes said in a report this week.

The US has imposed sanctions on two judges and two prosecutors of the International Criminal Court (ICC) for their role in pursuing cases against American soldiers and Israeli officials.

According to a State Department statement on Wednesday, Judge Kimberly Prost was blacklisted for approving The Hague-based court's investigation into the conduct of US troops in Afghanistan.

Judge Nicolas Yann Guillou was sanctioned for issuing arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of war crimes in Gaza. In addition, deputy prosecutors Nazhat Shameem Khan and Mame Mandiaye Niang were blacklisted for upholding the warrants. Neither the US nor Israel is a party to the ICC.

The ICC rejected the designations as “a flagrant attack against the independence of an impartial judicial institution, which operates under a mandate from 125 States Parties from all regions.”

US President Donald Trump imposed his first sanctions on the ICC in February, accusing the court of “illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel.” Netanyahu similarly denounced the arrest warrants, calling the ruling “anti-Semitic.”

In 2024, the ICC placed Netanyahu and Gallant on its wanted list after finding “reasonable grounds” that Israel had denied humanitarian aid into Gaza, where more than 60,000 people have been killed since 2023.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is facing resistance from within his government over his plan to dispatch troops to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire between Moscow and Kiev, Bild reported on Thursday.

Merz's reported backing for sending the German military to Ukraine has provoked his coalition partners, the Social Democratic Party (SPD), to announce that ""as of now, will only support this if the US also takes the lead, providing its own troops.”

US President Donald Trump earlier this week ruled out putting American boots on the ground in Ukraine.

Germany cannot station troops beyond its borders without a parliamentary majority backing the move, and even then there are limits on what operations they could engage in. Bild also noted that if Ukraine were attacked while German troops were stationed there, Berlin would be in “uncharted legal territory.” 

Publicly, Merz has not ruled out dispatching German soldiers to Ukraine, but has said “the whole of Europe should participate” in potential security guarantees to Kiev. “It is not just about the territory of Ukraine; it is about Europe's political order,” he added.

Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul, however, has warned that Germany's military capacity is already stretched to the limit. He noted it is currently the only European contributor with a combat-ready brigade stationed in Lithuania, and that simultaneously undertaking a mission in Ukraine “would probably be too much for us.”

Although Trump has ruled out deploying US ground troops to Ukraine, he has signaled willingness to offer an air support framework if Moscow and Kiev reach an agreement to end hostilities.

The Bild report follows the summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska last week, as well as a visit by Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky and several European leaders, including Merz, to Washington on Monday, with talks centered on settling the Ukraine conflict.

Russia has warned that any NATO or Western troop presence in Ukraine would be absolutely “unacceptable,” regardless of its form or potential scenarios.

WASHINGTON, August 21. /TASS/. Tulsi Gabbard, director of US National Intelligence, plans to slash her office staff by around 40% as well as suspend the operations of a center on counteracting the influence of foreign countries, including Russia, the agency's statement reads.

According to the document, ""a long-overdue transformation of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)"" is in the works. The overhaul ""will reduce ODNI by over 40% by the end of fiscal year 2025 and save taxpayers over $700 million per year and better enable ODNI to focus on fulfilling its critical role of serving as the central hub for intelligence integration, strategic guidance, and oversight over the Intelligence Community.""

In a fact sheet on the changes, the agency said several departments it argued were redundant would be refocused. Those include the Foreign Malign Influence Center, which describes its mission as ""mitigating threats to democracy."" Earlier, its employees insisted that other countries, including Russia and China, had been carrying out information campaigns aiming to affect the US.

Gabbard noted that ""over the last 20 years, ODNI has become bloated and inefficient, and the intelligence community is rife with abuse of power, unauthorized leaks of classified intelligence, and politicized weaponization of intelligence.""

Immediately after Donald Trump took office as US President, the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which was overseen by US entrepreneur Elon Musk, began a massive audit of spending from the US budget.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

NEW YORK, August 20. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump has said that a bilateral meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Vladimir Zelensky is being set up.

""I had a very successful meeting with President Putin. I had a very successful meeting with President Zelensky. And now I thought it would be better if they met without me, just to see… I want to see what goes on,"" Trump said in an interview with American journalist Mark Levin. ""They're in the process of setting it [the possible meeting] up, and we're going to see what happens,"" he added.

Trump also expressed optimism about resolving the conflict in Ukraine. ""You have to be a little bit optimistic,"" he said when asked a respective question.

Meanwhile the American leader noted that resolving the Ukrainian crisis turned out to be more difficult than he had expected.

On August 18, Trump held meetings with Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky and EU leaders. After those talks, Trump called his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. In a 40-minute phone call, the US leader discussed holding a one-on-one between Putin and Zelensky to be followed by a trilateral meeting with Trump present. Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov said that the Russian and US leaders supported the idea of holding additional direct meetings between Moscow and Kiev as they also considered elevating them to a higher level.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

VILNIUS, August 21. /TASS/. The troops that Lithuania may send to Ukraine as part of international security forces will not take part in combat operations, the Baltic nation's Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene said.

""Sending our troops to Ukraine would not be a combat mission. The contingent would not be deployed to the frontline or participate in military operations,"" she told the Ziniu Radijas radio station.

According to the defense chief, the deployment of troops to Ukraine requires a ceasefire and a clear US role in security forces.

Lithuanian Presidential Advisor Dainius Zikevicius said earlier this week that Vilnius was ready to take part in efforts to ensure security in Ukraine at a scale similar to the country's participation in NATO's operation in Afghanistan.

Between 2005 and 2013, Lithuania headed a NATO group for the reconstruction of Afghanistan's Ghor Province, fully funding its activities in 2007-2013. The group consisted of about 150 Lithuanian soldiers and officers, along with military and civilian experts from several other countries.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Serhiy K is believed to have been onboard boat from where 2022 attack on gas pipelines was carried out

A Ukrainian man alleged to have been involved in the 2022 detonation of the Nord Stream pipelines carrying gas from Russia to Germanyhas been arrested in Italy, according to German authorities.

The man, identified only as Serhiy K, is believed to have been onboard the sailing boat from where the attack was allegedly carried out.

Carabinieri arrested him on Wednesday evening near Rimini after a European arrest warrant was issued on Monday, Germany's federal prosecutor's office (GBA) said on Thursday.

The attacks on the pipelines, which were not in use, were carried out on 26 September 2022 and damaged them apparently beyond repair.

Investigators have long suspected a Ukrainian commando operation.

Divers are believed to have been taken there by the chartered sailing yacht Andromeda, which set off from the German port of Rostock to the area close to the pipelines near the Danish island of Bornholm, where they planted explosives on the sea bed.

Serhiy K is thought to have been onboard. Investigators do not believe he was one of the divers, but he is thought to have had a leading role as a coordinator of what appeared to have been a well-planned operation.

The yacht was hired with the help of intermediaries and using forged identity papers, from a German company, according to prosecutors.

The incident has been under investigation since 2022 by the GBA, which said it intended to charge any suspects with anti-constitutional sabotage and causing an explosion.

During extensive media investigations, in particular by the news magazine Der Spiegel, people who allegedly had detailed knowledge of the incident said the commandos had not intended to commit a crime. Instead, they had considered it an attack on a legitimate military target due to Russia's war on Ukraine, not least because the profits from gas deliveries to Germany had contributed significantly to financing Moscow's war.

Spiegel's research revealed evidence suggesting the action had been sanctioned by the Ukrainian armed forces, although this has been denied by Kyiv.

German prosecutors have not said when they expect Serhiy K to be extradited to face German authorities.

Separate investigations by Swedish and Danish authorities were closed in February 2024, leaving German authorities to continue their inquiries alone.

At one point Russia accused the US of being behind the sabotage, following Washington's criticism of Germany's dependence on Russian gas. Another initial strong assumption was that the perpetrators were Russian – but investigators traced the yacht and discovered its connection to Ukraine.

Like Kyiv, Washington and Moscow denied the allegations.

Last year Germany's federal prosecutor general, Jens Rommel, secured an initial arrest warrant against one of the suspected divers. However, the suspect left his home in Poland before he could be arrested after Polish authorities allegedly warned Ukrainian authorities in advance. The man is believed to have driven into Ukraine in a car with diplomatic licence plates, according to Spiegel.

Separately on Thursday, the Georgian captain of an oil tanker that damaged undersea cables in the Baltic Sea in 2024 after his vessel dragged along the sea bed for about 55 miles has denied wrongdoing, calling the incident a “maritime accident”.

Davit Vadatchkoria and the first and second officers of the Eagle S oil tanker are to face charges in a Helsinki court on Monday over the slicing of power and telecommunications cables as their vessel travelled westwards in the Gulf of Finland, having departed from a Russian oil port.

“We are innocent. It's only a maritime accident,” Vadatchkoria, who is being detained in Finland, told the Finnish public broadcaster YLE on Thursday.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Former US president wades into national conflict over House maps, as Texas lawmakers approve map to favor GOP

Barack Obama waded into states' efforts at rare mid-decade redistricting efforts, saying he agreed with California governor Gavin Newsom's plan to counter the new Texas congressional map by launching an effort to redraw his own state's map and create more Democratic-friendly districts, calling it “a responsible approach”.

“I believe that governor Newsom's approach is a responsible approach. He said this is going to be responsible. We're not going to try to completely maximize it,” Obama said at a Tuesday fundraiser on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. “We're only going to do it if and when Texas and/or other Republican states begin to pull these maneuvers. Otherwise, this doesn't go into effect.”

Obama also called Newsom's strategy “measured”, as it only temporarily grants the California legislature the ability to redraw maps mid-decade.

While noting that “political gerrymandering” is not his “preference,” Obama said that, if Democrats “don't respond effectively, then this White House and Republican-controlled state governments all across the country, they will not stop, because they do not appear to believe in this idea of an inclusive, expansive democracy”.

According to organizers, the event raised $2m for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and its affiliates, one of which has filed and supported litigation in several states over Republican-drawn districts. The former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Eric Holder, who served as Obama's attorney general and heads up the group, also appeared.

The former president's comments come as Texas lawmakers approved a plan to redraw the state's congressional districts, passing a new map on Wednesday that fulfills Donald Trump's desire to tilt the US House map in his favor before the 2026 midterm elections.

The vote was 88 in favor and 52 against.

The map could give Republicans five new House seats in 2026 and took more than two weeks to pass, after Democratic state lawmakers staged a walkout over what they described as a “a power grab”. Several legislators traveled to states run by Democrats, and the protest ultimately set the stage for a redistricting battle now playing out across the country.

Spurred on by the Texas situation, Democratic governors including Newsom have pondered ways to possibly strengthen their party's position by way of redrawing US House district lines, five years out from the census count that typically leads into such procedures.

In California – where voters in 2010 gave the power to draw congressional maps to an independent commission, with the goal of making the process less partisan – Democrats have unveiled a proposal that could give that state's dominant political party an additional five US House seats in a bid to win the fight to control Congress next year. If approved by voters in November, the blueprint could nearly erase Republican House members in the nation's most populous state, with Democrats intending to win the party 48 of its 52 US House seats, up from 43.

A hearing over that measure devolved into a shouting match Tuesday as a Republican lawmaker clashed with Democrats, and a committee voted along party lines to advance the new congressional map. California Democrats do not need any Republican votes to move ahead, and legislators are expected to approve a proposed congressional map and declare a 4 November special election by Thursday to get required voter approval.

Newsom and Democratic leaders say they'll ask voters to approve their new maps only for the next few elections, returning map-drawing power to the commission following the 2030 census – and only if a Republican state moves forward with new maps. Obama applauded that temporary timeline.

“And we're going to do it in a temporary basis because we're keeping our eye on where we want to be long term,” Obama said, referencing Newsom's take on the California plan. “I think that approach is a smart, measured approach, designed to address a very particular problem in a very particular moment in time.”

Editor's note: This item was updated with additional comments about the attack.

Russia attacked a factory owned by U.S. company Flex Ltd. in western Ukraine overnight on Aug. 21, less than a week after Russian President Vladimir Putin met U.S. President Donald Trump in Alaska to discuss ending the war.

Flex Ltd. is an American publicly traded multinational company and one of the world's largest electronics contract manufacturers.

It has been operating in Ukraine since 2000 and in 2012, opened the 55,000-square-meter Mukachevo plant in Zakarpattia Oblast that was targeted in Russia's attack. The plant employs over 2,600 people.

""This was an ordinary civilian facility with American investment. They produced everyday household items, such as coffee machines,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said after the attack.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also said the facility ""has nothing to do with defense or the military."" An employee at Flex told the Kyiv Independent that the plant does not produce any military equipment.

Russia launched 574 drones and decoys, and 40 missiles across Ukraine overnight, mostly targeting western regions far from the front lines. The attack on the area injured at least 23 people, local authorities said, and comes after both the Putin-Trump Alaska summit on Aug. 15 and Zelensky's meeting in Washington with Trump on Aug. 18.

The timing ""is sending a message that American businesses are a target,"" Andy Hunder, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine, told the Kyiv Independent from the site of the attack in Mukachevo.

""(Russia is) trying to humiliate American business that has been successfully working in Ukraine for decades.""

Sybiha said that one missile hit the Flex plant, while Zelensky said the site was targeted with ""several"" cruise missiles.

Photos and videos shared on social media show significant damage to the plant's premises. Hunder confirmed that the plant had sustained severe damage.

An employee at the plant told the Kyiv Independent that about 800 workers normally work on the night shift. On Aug. 21, most evacuated to on-site concrete shelters after the air raid alert went off.

According to the plant employee, the company had strict protocols in place during air raid alerts.

The Kyiv Independent reached out to the company for a comment, but did not receive a response by the time of publication.

This marks the first Russian strike on Mukachevo since the start of the full-scale invasion. The city lies some 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the Hungarian border.

This is not the first Russian strike on U.S.-linked facilities in Ukraine. In June, Russia targeted a building used by the U.S. aerospace and defense giant Boeing in an attack on Kyiv.

The attack caused fires at a large electronics plant in Mukachevo, with damage also reported in other cities, including Lviv.

""This was an ordinary civilian facility with American investment. They produced everyday household items, such as coffee machines,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

The closure comes ahead of the ""Zapad-2025"" military drills, scheduled to take place in Belarus from Sept. 12 to 16. Minsk said the joint exercises with Russia are intended to test both countries' ability to ensure security and repel possible aggression.

Tovste is a frontline village southwest of the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk and near the key town of Vuhledar.

President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that Flamingo had undergone successful tests, describing it as ""the most successful"" missile Ukraine currently has.

""I explained to (U.S. President Donald Trump) that the talks about them (Russia) occupying our Donbas by the end of (2025) are all just chatter,"" said President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Sending European troops to Ukraine as part of security guarantees would amount to ""foreign military intervention,"" which Moscow won't support, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Aug. 21.



""We are ready for the bilateral meeting. If the Russians are not, then we would like to see a strong response from the United States,"" Zelensky said, adding that he asked Trump to impose additional sanctions on Moscow if it rejects talks with Ukraine.

Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) struck a Russian patrol boat in the Black Sea near the occupied town of Zaliznyi Port in Kherson Oblast, killing five crew members, HUR reported on Aug. 21. 

The number includes 830 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

""There's the dawning reality that this will be Europe making this happen on the ground... The U.S. is not fully committed to anything,"" an unnamed NATO diplomat said.

The attack allegedly hit the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery, which has previously been targeted in Ukrainian drone strikes. 

The plan would require countries that have signed security agreements with Ukraine to deliberate and respond quickly in the event of another Russian attack following a peace agreement. It would not include NATO membership for Ukraine. 

Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, illegally occupied by Russia since 2014, is roughly 26 times smaller than Texas. ","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Lithuania has closed its airspace along the border with Belarus until Oct. 1, citing security risks tied to drones and upcoming Russian-Belarusian military exercises, the Defense Ministry said on Aug. 21, according to BNS.

Belarus has played a crucial role as Russia's ally in the full-scale war against Ukraine, providing its territory as a launchpad for Russian military operations. 

The decision, approved by Lithuania's Ministry of Transport and Communications at the request of Lithuania's armed forces, was taken ""in view of the security situation and threats to society, including risks to civil aviation due to violations of airspace by unmanned aerial vehicles,"" the ministry said in a statement.

Officials noted that the ban could be extended if drone incursions from Belarusian territory continue.

Lithuania has reported several such incidents in recent weeks. The most recent occurred on Aug. 1, when an unidentified drone triggered a days-long search before being discovered at the Gaiziunai training ground in the central Jonava district. 

Authorities later identified it as a Russian-made Gerbera drone carrying about two kilograms (4.4 pounds) of explosives.

In response, Lithuania has strengthened its air defenses, announced plans to fortify its border, and committed to purchasing new detection and counter-drone systems.

The closure comes ahead of the ""Zapad-2025"" military drills, scheduled to take place in Belarus from Sept. 12 to 16. Minsk said the joint exercises with Russia are intended to test both countries' ability to ensure security and repel possible aggression.

The Zapad-2025 drills will involve around 13,000 troops and are among the largest joint exercises held by Russia and Belarus.

The plan would require countries that have signed security agreements with Ukraine to deliberate and respond quickly in the event of another Russian attack following a peace agreement. It would not include NATO membership for Ukraine. 

Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, illegally occupied by Russia since 2014, is roughly 26 times smaller than Texas. ","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

The U.S. and Canada were built on, and will continue to be dependent on, trade and immigration.Lindsay Dedario/Reuters

Claude Lavoie is a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail. He was director-general of economic studies and policy analysis at the Department of Finance from 2008 to 2023.

U.S. tariffs, manufacturing subsidies, and anti-immigration and isolationist policies reflect a population discontent with trade and globalization that has been growing since the financial crisis of 2008. While the U.S. government may be the loudest voice against globalization, similar nationalistic policies can be seen in many other countries, including Canada, where measures to favour domestic industries and limit immigration are increasingly popular. 

The critical force behind the rise of this sentiment is the failure to recognize and address the negatives of globalization. Just attempting to return to the previous status quo by returning tariffs to zero, redirecting trade toward friendlier foes, or reducing immigration will not eliminate this sentiment. 

In previous decades, globalization was seen as the path to prosperity and peace. Free movement of goods, people and ideas, amplified by new communication technologies, were expected to bring significant opportunities and those pushing back were labelled as marginal and reactionary. Now, the previous consensus supporting international trade, migration and free markets seems to have been replaced by a “new economic nationalism.”

Were those earlier beliefs wrong? Most studies suggest trade and global integration have raised incomes and cut poverty and income gaps between countries. This is not surprising as trade has historically been associated with wealth. Globalization has not stopped America from being great. As a matter of fact, U.S. companies are global leaders, and the U.S. economy was booming before the current administration tried to make it great again. 

Opinion: America is sinking, and Canada cannot go down with the ship

Opinion: As we spend to boost the trade-war economy, recall the sins of pandemic spending past

But globalization is resented by many because its drawbacks were not properly addressed. Like technology, be it nuclear power, the internet or AI, widespread adoption of any social innovation comes with negatives that need to be mitigated. 

Such mitigation should be simple. Trade creates more winners than losers and the overall gains should be used to compensate losers to avoid escalating resentment. The problem is that many communities negatively affected by globalization, such as blue-collar workers, were not provided with adequate support because of faulty beliefs on the part of governments and winners' greed. 

Labour standards could have been strengthened or social supports increased to help these communities, but these require raising taxes, and governments were convinced doing this would hurt our international competitiveness. Studies have shown that taxes and standards are not necessarily detrimental to competitiveness. There are many wealthy open-trading economies with high tax burdens, high labour standards and generous social safety nets. 

We were also convinced that labour reallocation and upskilling would occur organically, ensuring trade gains would trickle down. But people cannot easily relocate their family or transition from a low-skill to a high-skill job. Many people did not pursue high-skill careers because of a lack of confidence or ability. Financial, time and emotional costs are often barriers too high for most, and these costs needed to be managed through significant hands-on support from many stakeholders. 

To be sure, trade and globalization create interdependencies which make us more vulnerable to things like cyberattacks and disruptions in supply chains. Bans on vaccines and mask exports during COVID and the dependence of the U.S. military on Chinese-made components illustrate this issue well. 

But putting up protectionist barriers and isolationist policies is not a solution; it will only result in losing the benefits of trade and global interconnectedness. The U.S. and Canada were built on, and will continue to be dependent on, trade and immigration. Most of the issues like AI or climate change are global in nature. 

Globalization is not dead, though it has slowed. And while finding new trading partners and standing our ground with the U.S. is a good thing, Canada cannot escape its geography and cultural links with our southern neighbour. What we have needed and still need is a mitigation strategy to make globalization fairer and more inclusive, and make interdependence feel safe.

This means an adequate and efficient safety net, stronger labour bargaining power, and adequate resources for immigrant integration and youth at risk. It means having the necessary infrastructure to pivot across different suppliers and buyers depending on geopolitical vagaries. It means undertaking adequate systemic risk analysis to identify the large undiversifiable economic risks and the actions necessary to mitigate them. 

The digital tax is an example of a strategy to make globalization more inclusive, and its abandonment is not really a good thing. 

This crisis moment provides an opportunity to address the drawbacks of globalization and any future structural change with complementary policies and recognize that we focused too much on efficiency gains and not enough on security, cultural and inequality considerations.

Eric BurnettCourtesy of family

Eric Frederick Peter Burnett: Dad. Engineer. Opera lover. Teacher. Born Jan. 7, 1937, in Roodepoort, South Africa; died March 13, 2025, in Richmond, B.C., of dementia, aged 88.

Eric Burnett could never quite believe he'd reached the age of 88, but he liked that he had as many years as there are keys on a piano.

He was born to Eileen and Peter Burnett, the eldest of three boys. The family lived on an acreage on the outskirts of Bulawayo (then Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe), a rail hub from which Peter worked as a train conductor.

Eric and his brothers, Basil and Hylton, had a series of pets, including fox terriers and duikers, small antelopes whose babies they'd find abandoned in the bush. At 11, Eric was sent away to Grey High School – a three-day journey by train.

Boarding school meant sudden independence. Eric developed a hard-nosed self-sufficiency, taking up boxing (permanently deviating his septum) and for the first time getting high marks. His teachers broadened his horizons, he said, introducing him to literature and art, and sparking an interest in travel and higher education.

He was the first in his family to attend university, taking the gold medal in civil engineering with his BSc at the University of Cape Town. A full-ride Shell scholarship enabled his MSc (engineering) and Diploma of Imperial College, and he eventually earned his PhD from the University of London.

While there, friends introduced him to Angela Towert, a vivacious, whip-smart librarian who'd grown up in South Africa. In 1964 he moved to Canada for a teaching post at the University of Waterloo, and soon wrote to invite Angela to join him on his transatlantic adventure.

In February, 1965, they were married in Toronto. On their wedding day, with his lifelong talent for understatement, he told his bride, “You look quite nice.” Their marriage of 58 years survived – and by many measures thrived – because his praise was as sincere as it was precious.

Eric's humour was mostly wry, and he shared his love of British comedy with his children, Alastair and Gillian. He laughed hardest and longest at his son's jokes, especially when they were at his own expense.

And they often were. An avid photographer, Eric's pictures of buildings outnumbered those of family. His kids would jokingly point and yell, “Salt damage!” to get his attention. 

As a parent, he was both supportive and demanding. He celebrated his children's successes and left no doubt of their failures. His talent for math skipped a generation, and Gillian would sometimes find a handwritten note on her report cards: “Inadequate.”

He brought the same high standards to his work. Over his distinguished 25-year career teaching civil engineering at Waterloo, students would occasionally call him at home to request extensions. If his children answered, they'd advise them not to ask.

Eric was proud of his industry partnerships and advocated strongly for women in his male-dominated profession. He was the founder and director of the Building Engineering Group until 1996 and a senior consultant and technical director with Trow Consulting Engineers Ltd.

In his career's second act, the couple moved to the U.S., where Eric held the Hankin Chair in Residential Construction at Penn State from 1996 to 2005 and was director for the Pennsylvania Housing Research/Resource Center. Upon retirement, his team threw a party featuring a life-size cardboard cut-out of him asleep at his desk. His humility and sense of humour pervaded everything he did.

In retirement, they moved to Richmond, B.C., where Eric co-authored an engineering textbook and worked as a consultant at RDH Building Sciences. 

At 69, a stroke forced him to spend more time on his many hobbies. He was a serious collector of stamps (specializing in southern Africa), wooden boxes and hippo figurines. He surrounded himself with Folio Society hardcover classics, paperback murder mysteries and classical music. You could tell he was home by the strains of Puccini wafting through his office door. 

He adored his grandkids, Jasper and Alice, whose childhoods he helped shape.

Eric's world got much smaller when Angela died in 2023. While he wasn't a naturally demonstrative man, his last chapter was distinguished by an easy and moving affection for those he loved. His continued laughter at Alastair's jokes – and an occasional zinger of his own – was a gift right up until a few days before his death.

Gillian Burnett is Eric Burnett's daughter.

A well-known rhino breeder from South Africa has been accused of helping smuggle nearly a thousand of rhino horns to Southeast Asia in a multimillion dollar scheme.

South African prosecutors have accused a high-profile animal breeder of running an illegal rhino horn smuggling network across the globe.

John Hume, 83, once owned one of the world's largest rhino herds at his ranch near Johannesburg. He and five others are accused of running a scheme to export more than 900 rhino horns valued at $14.1 million (€12.2 million).

All five were arrested on Tuesday following a ""complex investigation into transnational trafficking of rhino horns"" that began in 2017, the police's specialized Hawks unit said.

South Africa's Environment Minister Dion George said the investigation was ""a powerful demonstration of South Africa's resolve to protect its natural heritage.""

Zimbabwean-born Hume owned the 7,800-hectare (19,270-acre) Platinum Rhino ranch in South Africa's North West province until 2023, when it was bought by wildlife NGO African Parks in a bid to rewild the animals.

The ranch is home to around 2,000 animals — around 15% of the world's remaining wild population of southern white rhinos.

Investigators said they uncovered fraud involving government officials who issued permits for 964 rhino horns to be sold domestically, but which were actually shipped to illegal markets in Southeast Asia.

South African law allows the domestic trade of rhino horns. But overseas sales are banned under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.

Rhinos were once abundant across Africa but have dramatically fallen in number due to large-scale hunting and poaching. Alongside ivory, rhino horns are highly sought-after in Asia as status symbols and for their supposed aphrodisiac properties.

Germany is ageing and needs new soldiers and spies to keep it safe, as well as nurses to tend to its elderly. Berlin is looking far and wide to fill gaps, from Indonesia to a games convention. DW has the latest.

Germany's Federal Intelligence Service (BND) and its Bundeswehr, or military, are both actively recruiting gamers to join their ranks.

The BND and Bundeswehr both have large recruiting stands at the Gamescom video game convention in Cologne this week.

Federal Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is in Indonesia as part of an Asian tour.

Wadephul is visiting schools that prepare Indonesians to immigrate to Germany to fill empty positions in the healthcare sector, largely as nurses and caregivers.

This blog looking at the latest news in Germany on Thusday, August 21, 2025:

Germany's Federal Criminal Police (BKA) on Thursday released a new report documenting a spike in the number of child sexual abuse cases registered in 2024, recording more than 18,000. This statistic does not include unreported cases, meaning real numbers are likely far higher.

The BKA says the vast majority of those abused are girls (13,365 of 18,085).

BKA accounts show that most victims are familiar with their abusers, either through school, friends or family. Another statistic highlights the fact that abusers are often minors themselves, with roughly one-third of them under the age of 18. A shocking 12.1% were under the age of 14.

Youths were also involved in some 40% of all cases having to do with child pornography.

Most of the crimes recorded in the BKA report took place online, Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt said during the report's presentation. Dobrindt alsopromised that Berlin would soon have a plan for tracking and archiving IP addresses tied to abuse.

Online sexual abuse often involves adults posing as peers to manipulate children or paying for livestreams of abuse.

The environmental organization Greenpeace released a report comparing the price of train and airplane travel across Europe and found that in 66 of 142 cases it looked at, environmentally friendly train travel was more expensive than flying.

Greenpeace found great discrepancies when it came to destination and distance; with train travel from Germany to Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic and Poland being less expensive than air travel, but the opposite being true for France, Italy, Spain and the UK.

Greenpeace said that in 70% of the domestic routes it compared, train travel was cheaper, but that this was only the case in 39% of international routes.  

The study only compared prices and did not take into account extra fees charged by airlines for baggage, nor did it factor in early booking discounts afforded by train operators.

Although a majority of travelers cite easy accessibility and environmental friendliness as the reason they prefer train travel, poor punctuality and unreliable service have been a real Achilles' heel for German train operator Deutsche Bahn (DB).

Greenpeace transportation expert Lena Donat said Thursday, ""Lots of people would prefer to head into vacation on a train, but lack of connections, complicated booking services and high prices keep them from doing so.""

Greenpeace has called on European politicians to rectify the situation, which has slowly improved for train operators, by fostering more international train travel, easing the tax burden of train tickets and finally leveling ""fair"" taxes on flights.

Greenpeace claims that roughly 1% of the world's population is responsible for half of global plane exhaust emissions.

One bright spot in the report is the fact that trains have actually made up ground over the past couple of years. A 2023 study found that train travel was less expensive than plane travel only 27% of the time, whereas that number jumped to 41% in this most recent analysis.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul on Thursday was given a tour of a German language school in Indonesia as part of an effort to recruit specialized foreign workers from the southeast Asian archipelago.

Germany's demographics are thus that its population is ageing, unlike Indonesia's. The fourth most-populous nation in the world behind India, China and the US, Indonesia is also the world's largest Muslim nation and half of its 284 million citizens are under the age of 30.

In the Indonesian capital Jakarta, Wadephul spoke with young Indonesians about their plans for the future while visiting a nursing school. Wadephul made the visit accompanied by Indonesian Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin and Contanze Michel, director of the Goethe Institute Indonesia, which is responsible for coordinating language classes at the school.

Language hurdles have proven to be a significant barrier to would be immigrants from abroad. While in Indonesia, Wadephul signed contracts for the creation of four further language schools.

Germany is keenly interested in recruiting healthcare workers but Jakarta is pushing for recruits to other sectors, too, such as the hospitality sector.

Currently, however, only about 1,000 work visas are issued to Indonesians each year — Berlin says impediments to date have been lack of education, inadequate language skills and lack of German recognition of foreign training certificates and titles.

Wadephul will visit both Christian and Muslim houses of worship before concluding his trip, as well as touring a factory owned by German automobile and truck giant Daimler Truck AG.

Germany's Federal Intelligence Service (BND) and its military, the Bundeswehr, have both set up recruiting stands at the international gaming conference Gamescom, which opens to the general public Thursday in the western German city of Cologne.

BND spokeswoman Julia Linner says tech-savvy visitors are welcome to come to the agency's stand to play ""BND Legends — Operation Blackbox,"" which sees players assume the identity of an undercover agent to foil a cyberattack. The game, which the BND plans to make available on a public platform, tests players' ability in a number of specific situations.

Spokeswoman Linner, who says ""the agency itself is a blackbox to many, we wanted to open it a little,"" notes that gamers tend to have skill-sets conducive to spy agency effectiveness — including digital prowess, communications skills, a team attitude and stress resistance.

Germany's army is recruiting at Gamescom for similar reasons. Visitors to their stand can drive tanks or fly helicopters in simulators, or do an actual physical workout in bulletproof gear under a giant poster reading: ""Are you ready for the next level?""  

Like the BND'S Linner, army spokesman Marco Mann says, ""We're where our target group is."" Mann says the Bundeswehr, which has been present at Gamescom since 2009, wants to let young people know what an attractive employer it is.

Critics, however, worry about the appropriateness of such a situation, with pacifists like Jürgen Grässlin of the German Peace Society (DFG) saying, ""In killer games, players take on various roles in which they simulate murder, they are even given bonus points for killing an enemy.""

""The Bundeswehr,"" he says, ""has no reason to be at Gamescom.""

Guten Tag from the Bonn online news team, and welcome to our coverage of Germany this Thursday.

Today, we are reporting on Germany's spy agency and army recruiting young computer gamers to catch bad guys and fly helicopters.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul says Berlin wants to take on more responsibility together with Tokyo — diplomatically, economically, and militarily.

When German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul stood in front of warships at the Japanese naval base in Yokosuka on Tuesday and spoke about China's growing dominance in the region, he knew where it would be viewed particularly critically.

China still hasn't forgotten the German-Japanese alliance during World War II.

A day before, when Wadephul accused China of ""aggressive actions"" in the region, Beijing reacted angrily and warned against ""inciting confrontation and tensions.""

But the German foreign minister appeared to have no intention of backing down.

""Neither in Europe, nor in the Indo-Pacific, nor anywhere else in the world, should borders be shifted by force,"" Wadephul said at the military base in Yokosuka.

It is a clear message with regard to Taiwan — officially known as the ""Republic of China."" Beijing claims sovereignty over the self-ruled democratic island and vows to seize control, even by force if necessary.  

Germany is committed to the ""one China policy,"" under which Berlin recognizes the government of the People's Republic of China in Beijing as the sole legal government of China.

Although Germany does not maintain official diplomatic relations with Taiwan, it has economic, cultural and research ties with the island, and advocates for peaceful reunification based on mutual agreement.

Jürgen Hardt, a German politician from Chancellor Friedrich Merz's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), told DW that Berlin needed to send a clear signal to Beijing as Europe continues to fight for the future of Ukraine.

""We have often asked representatives of the Chinese government whether they support Russia against Ukraine, and they have denied it. But we have a clear impression that this is not true,"" said Hardt, who is accompanying Wadephul on his Asia trip.

That is why it is right to speak candidly with China, he added.

German troops are currently stationed at the Yokosuka base, where they are part of an international military mission monitoring the enforcement of UN sanctions against North Korea.

""Germany wants to take on more responsibility,"" Wadephul said in Tokyo, stressing that ""systemic rivalry is playing an increasingly important role in our relations.""

The German foreign minister described Japan as Germany's ""premium partner"" in Asia.

""We consider it necessary to take on more responsibility together in terms of security policy,"" he said.

A business delegation also accompanied Wadephul on his trip.

Arnd Franz, CEO of automotive supplier Mahle in Stuttgart, highlighted the need to diversify supply chains and reduce critical dependencies.  

""Our question is: How do we deal with dependencies on raw materials and rare earths?"" he asked, pointing out that there are only a few suppliers in the world for some products. ""China plays a very dominant role in this, which it exploits.""

Mahle produces eight million electric motors a year.

""The Japanese are better prepared for this situation thanks to their risk management, and we are learning from that here,"" said Franz.

Japan is also much further ahead in its goal of reducing its strategic dependence on China. The country now imports only about 60% of its rare earths from China, while Germany relies on China for 90% of its rare earths.

Japan's ties to Germany over the past few years have also been bolstered by Tokyo's strong support for Ukraine.

Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Tokyo has provided around €12 billion in aid and slapped sanctions on Moscow.

Beijing, on the other hand, supports ""Russia's war machine,"" Wadephul said, adding Germany will ""defend the international rules-based order in this region as well,"" referring to the Taiwan Strait — a major maritime route that is of great strategic importance to trade-reliant economies like Germany and Japan.

""Any escalation in the Taiwan Strait would have serious consequences for global security and the economy,"" warned the minister.

Germany and Japan have deepened their security cooperation since both sides inked a confidentiality agreement in 2021, allowing their intelligence agencies to share information.

To demonstrate its commitment to the Indo-Pacific, Berlin is also increasingly dispatching German warships on visits to Japanese ports and deploying German Eurofighter jets to Japanese military bases for joint exercises.

The defense industries of both countries are also mulling closer cooperation.

""Germany and Japan are spending much more on defense today, which creates potential,"" said Hardt, the CDU politician. ""Even though companies from both countries are sometimes competitors — as was recently the case when Australia ordered Japanese ships instead of German ones — we will soon be working more closely together.""

Countries in Southeast Asia are paying close attention to events in Europe, with many in the region fearing that a bad deal for Ukraine could encourage Beijing to take a more aggressive stance toward Taiwan or in the South China Sea.

""In the case of Ukraine, we had to revise our assessment of the security situation in Europe,"" said Hardt, pointing out that German politicians hadn't taken warnings from Eastern Europe and elsewhere about the threat posed by Russia seriously enough.

 ""We should not make the same mistake twice,"" he underlined.

			The US president pushed to redraw the districts to boost GOP seats in 2026, sparking Democratic walk-out

The Texas House on Wednesday approved redrawn congressional maps that would give Republicans a bigger edge in 2026, pushing through a partisan gerrymander that triggered weeks of protests by Democrats and a national battle over redistricting.

The approval came at the urging of Donald Trump, the US President, who pushed for the mid-decade revision of congressional maps to give his party a better chance at holding onto the House of Representatives in next year's midterm elections. 

The maps need to be approved by the GOP-controlled state Senate and signed by Greg Abbott, the Texas governor, before they become official. But the Texas House vote had presented the best chance for Democrats to derail the redraw.

Democratic legislators delayed the vote by two weeks by fleeing Texas earlier this month, returning only after being placed under round-the-clock police surveillance to ensure attendance at Wednesday's session.

The approval of the Texas maps on an 88-52 party-line vote is likely to prompt California's Democratic-controlled state Legislature this week to approve a new House map creating five new Democratic-leaning districts. But the California map would require voter approval in November.

Democrats also plan to challenge the Texas map in court, accusing Republicans of prioritising partisan advantage over urgent legislation, such as responding to last month's deadly floods.

Republicans have been open about their political motives. State Representative Todd Hunter, who authored the legislation, said: “The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance.” 

After nearly eight hours of debate, he summarised the issue as “nothing more than a partisan fight.”

Democrats said the disagreement was about more than partisanship. 

“In a democracy, people choose their representatives,” Representative Chris Turner said. “This bill flips that on its head and lets politicians in Washington, DC, choose their voters.”

State Representative John H. Bucy blamed the president. “This is Donald Trump's map,” Mr Bucy said. “It clearly and deliberately manufactures five more Republican seats in Congress because Trump himself knows that the voters are rejecting his agenda.”

The Republican power play has already triggered a national tit-for-tat battle as Democratic state lawmakers prepared to gather in California on Thursday to revise that state's map to create five new Democratic seats.

“This is a new Democratic Party, this is a new day, this is new energy out there all across this country,” California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom said on a call with reporters on Wednesday. “And we're going to fight fire with fire.”

A new California map would need to be approved by voters in a special election in November because that state normally operates with a non-partisan commission drawing the map to avoid the very sort of political brawl that is playing out. 

Mr Newsom himself backed the 2008 ballot measure to create that process, as did Barack Obama, the former US president.

But in a sign of Democrats' stiffening resolve, on Tuesday night Mr Obama backed Mr Newsom's bid to redraw the California map, saying it was a necessary step to stave off the GOP's Texas move.

“I think that approach is a smart, measured approach,” Mr Obama said during a fundraiser for the Democratic Party's main redistricting arm.

The only way opponents could stop the new Texas map would be to argue that it violates the Voting Rights Act, which requires minority communities be kept together so they can choose representatives of their choice.

Democrats noted that, in every decade since the 1970s, courts have found that Texas' legislature did violate the Voting Rights Act in redistricting, and that civil rights groups had an active lawsuit making similar allegations against the 2021 map that Republicans drew up.

Republicans contend that the new map creates more new majority-minority seats than the previous one. Democrats and some civil rights groups have countered that the GOP does that through mainly a numbers game that leads to halving the number of the state's House seats that will be represented by a Black representative.

The GOP used a parliamentary manoeuvre to take a second and final vote on the map so it wouldn't have to reconvene for one more vote after Senate approval.

Dustin Burrows, the House speaker, announced as debate started that doors to the chamber were locked and any member leaving was required to have a permission slip. The doors were only unlocked after final passage more than eight hours later. One Democrat who refused the 24-hour police monitoring, State Representative Nicole Collier, had been confined to the House floor since Monday night.

Republicans issued civil arrest warrants to bring the Democrats back after they left the state on Aug 3, and Mr Abbott asked the state Supreme Court to oust several Democrats from office. The lawmakers also face a fine of $500 for every day they were absent.

The Trump administration frequently uses popular music in its propaganda videos, including by artists who oppose Trump.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

The White House has entered a social media dispute with anti-Trump musician Jack White, formerly of The White Stripes, whose song was recently used by the Trump administration in a Border Patrol propaganda video.

In a video posted for Father's Day by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Border Patrol, The White Stripes's “We're Going to Be Friends” plays quietly in the background over a video of a Border Patrol agent riding an ATV in the desert. A young child narrates a tribute to her dad, calling him a “superhero.” 

“He rides his ATV in the desert with Border Patrol,” she says. “He helps keep our communities safe.” 

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Truthout was unable to reach White for comment.

Last year, White called President Donald Trump an “obvious fascist” and “wannabe dictator.” More recently, he criticized Trump's redecorating choices.

​​“Look at how disgusting Trump has transformed the historic White House,” White wrote in an Instagram post under a photo of Trump's meeting with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. “It's now a vulgar, gold leafed and gaudy, professional wrestler's dressing room.”

In response, a White House spokesperson said the Grammy-award winning artist is a “washed up, has-been loser.”  

White responded, telling “MAGA folk” to “enjoy your paving over your rose garden, your 200 million dollar ballroom in the White House, and your gaudy ass gold spray painted trinkets from Home Depot, cause he ain't spending any money on helping YOU unless you fit into his white supremacist country club rich idiot agenda.”

Trump has used White's music before. Last year, the Trump campaign's deputy director of communications posted and then deleted a solicitation for donations featuring The White Stipes's “Seven Nation Army.” 

“Oh….Don't even think about using my music you fascists,” White posted on Instagram.

The White Stripes sued, but dropped the lawsuit in December. The band did not provide a reason, although these types of lawsuits can take years and run up high costs for the litigants.

The Instagram accounts for the DHS, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Border Patrol, and others frequently post propaganda videos featuring popular music, including by artists who detest him, such as the late Nipsey Hussle, who wrote “Fuck Donald Trump” and headlined a tour of the same name. In that video, Border Patrol agents board a helicopter that flies over what appears to be the desert in the Southwestern part of the United States.

Other videos include music by: the Black Eyed Peas (“Pump It”), Fergie (“Glamorous”), Young Jeezy, featuring Akon (“Soul Survivor”), Madonna (“Like a Prayer”), Shaboozey, featuring Paul Cauthen (“Last of My Kind”), Vanilla Ice (“Ice Ice Baby”), Red Hot Chili Peppers (“Can't Stop”), Dolly Parton (“9 to 5”), Survivor (“Eye of the Tiger”), Hall and Oates (“Private Eyes”), Solo Artist Saxx (“Blowin Up”), and LL Cool J (“Mama Said Knock You Out.”)

The videos featuring LL Cool J and Solo Artist Saxx's music are particularly odious. Their songs play over videos of the administration's abductions. In the LL Cool J video, Border Patrol agents handcuff a man and lift up the back of his shirt, exposing a tattoo. The abduction occurs outside a 7-Eleven convenience store and the man's clothes appear to be splattered with paint. The video with “Blowin Up” shows a montage of Border Patrol agents violently grabbing people off the street.

Throughout his political career, artists have lambasted Trump for using their music in his political campaigns. During the 2024 presidential campaign, Beyonce sent the Trump campaign a cease and desist letter after they used her song, “Freedom,” in a video showing Trump stepping out of an airplane. 

In August, Isaac Hayes III, son of the late musician Isaac Hayes, posted on social media: “Today, on the anniversary of my father @isaachayes death we have repeatedly asked Donald Trump, the RNC and his representatives not to use ‘Hold on I'm Coming' written by Isaac Hayes and David Porter during campaign rallies but yet again, in Montana they used it. Donald Trump represents the worst in integrity and class with his disrespect and sexual abuse of Women and racist rhetoric. We will now deal with this very swiftly.” 

The late musician's estate and Isaac Hayes Enterprises LLC sued the president, his campaign, and others. In April, the judge denied Trump's request to dismiss the lawsuit. 

During his 2020 campaign, Trump played Panic! At The Disco's “High Hopes” at a rally. 

“Dear Trump Campaign, F–k you,” the band's vocalist, Brendon Urie, fired back in a social media post. “You're not invited. Stop playing my song.”

What does gentrification have to do with authoritarianism? In this episode of “Movement Memos,” host Kelly Hayes talks with organizer and author Andrew Lee about how displacement, surveillance, and “quality of life” policing function as tools of social control — and why housing struggles are class struggles. “Anti-displacement fights are interesting,” Lee says, “because of the revolutionary implications of what's really an incredibly modest demand.”

Note: This a rush transcript and has been lightly edited for clarity. Copy may not be in its final form.Kelly Hayes: Welcome to “Movement Memos,” a Truthout podcast about organizing, solidarity and the work of making change. I'm your host, writer and organizer Kelly Hayes. This week, we are talking about displacement and how organized communities are resisting the violence of gentrification. We will be hearing from organizer and author Andrew Lee, whose book Defying Displacement, provides some necessary context for Trump's attacks on unhoused people. While the violence playing out in Washington, D.C., is part of an authoritarian process of consolidation, the aggressive policing of Black and brown people, and the cruel displacement of unhoused people are practices that have been normalized around the country in a bipartisan manner. We can't have an honest conversation about what Trump is doing to unhoused people in the nation's capital without talking about displacement, which Andrew calls “the leading edge of confrontation with the contemporary ruling class.” Trump is presently sharpening that edge, in the same way that he's sharpening other tools that officials in both parties have developed and deployed over the years. So, what does this mean for our organizing and our resistance? We'll get into it.

KH: Andrew Lee, welcome to “Movement Memos.”

Andrew Lee: Thank you so much, I'm so excited to be here.

KH: How are you doing today?

AL: I'm doing well. I'm doing really well.

KH: Glad to hear it. For members of our audience who might be unfamiliar with your work, can you tell us a bit about yourself and what you do?

AL: I'm a person who organizes and writes against political and economic displacement. I've been a part of anti-gentrification campaigns in the so-called Silicon Valley, and Philly, where I'm currently based. I'm on the board of the Institute for Anarchist Studies. I work on strategy for a formation called Decolonize Philly, and I'm the author of a book called Defying Displacement.

KH: Well, thank you so much for making the time to talk with me today. In your book, you write that struggles against displacement are “the leading edge of confrontation with the contemporary ruling class.” How is that edge being sharpened now amid authoritarian consolidation, tech oligarchy, and the advance of the global right?

AL: Anti-displacement fights are interesting because of the revolutionary implications of what's really an incredibly modest demand. When you're fighting against displacement, what you're saying is, “Let me keep living in substandard housing. Let me keep sending my kids to underfunded schools. Let me keep paying exorbitant rent to an absentee landlord. Just don't raise that rent to three times what I could possibly pay. Forget about improving or empowering my disinvested community, I just want my community to not be obliterated.”

And yet, and yet, in gentrifying cities, when people make this incredibly small demand, they find themselves fighting the most powerful institutions in our society: elite universities, global corporations, unified city governments, the police. All of these institutions come together because this modest demand poses such a threat to the entire system of private property and racial capitalism if it were actually going to be fulfilled. And as you say, that edge is being sharpened as we speak.

As of this recording, we're just a few days into Trump seizing control of the D.C. police and deploying the National Guard. Trump has talked about violent crime, carjacking as reasons for sending in the National Guard to these cities, but really, the proximate cause for this unprecedented deployment was him seeing unhoused people on the street as he was being driven to a golf course. This might be the first time in U.S. history where the military is deployed domestically to do “quality of life policing,” something that I'm calling “military gentrification.”

Authoritarian consolidation, it allows for an intensified militarized version of something for which there's actually bipartisan elite support. We can see that from what California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, did last year, weaponizing state agencies for an industrial scale effort to “dismantle” unhoused encampments across the state. Just like Trump is deploying the military to dismantle encampments in D.C., we're seeing a heightening of these same tensions and pressures that we're already building across the country and across the political spectrum.

KH: I really appreciate what you're saying about militarized gentrification, and how we are seeing a militarized version of something that already had bipartisan support. This is really important for folks to understand, as California Gov. Gavin Newsom attempts to style himself as a primary opponent of Trumpism. Newsom is so enthusiastic about displacing unhoused people that he has literally taken up that work with his own hands. When we look at the escalations in policing we are seeing in D.C. right now, with checkpoints and soldiers and FBI agents patrolling the streets, we are talking about the ramping up of racist state violence in a city where Black people were already ten times more likely than white people to be arrested. Pouring more and more money into police budgets as essential services have been slashed over the course of my lifetime has been a bipartisan priority. So, we have to be honest about how we got here. Because we can't get out of this mess with this same politics that helped deliver us to this moment. 

Now, in cities around the country, and at the national level, both parties have doubled down on policing as a singular response to effects and symptoms of extreme inequality. In your chapter on terror, you document the role of police in displacing communities. Under Trump, we are looking at a level of financial destabilization that could leave many of us vulnerable to displacement. In the context of authoritarianism, do you see intensifying housing insecurity as a strategy of control?

AL: Yes. I think housing precarity weakens our attachment to place, and to place-based power, and it also weakens our connections and our solidarity with one another, right? It prevents us from building power where we are if we're always being threatened with having to move. It forces us to work more hours at exploitative jobs to pay the rent. This intensifying housing security is absolutely a way to destabilize working-class communities, but at the same time, housing instability itself is problematized by the state and the national security apparatus as a source of instability. We have institutions like the World Bank, the World Economic Forum saying that income inequality, gentrification are going to be major risks for social stability into the 21st century, especially in large gentrifying cities because when people are being evicted and criminalized and gentrified and displaced against all the odds, against all those forces I just mentioned that discourage political action, people end up fighting back.

KH: Your description of displacement as destabilizing for the working class, but also potentially destabilizing for the ruling class, since it gives people a reason to fight, reflects the short-sightedness that I think really defines this era of inequality. We aren't talking about people with a coherent long-term vision for anything. In Trump's White House, you have the apocalyptic politics of Christian Nationalism and techno-fascist cults. But even in the business world at large, short-term profits are prioritized over the habitability of the planet itself. In Silicon Valley, people found companies based on products that don't exist yet, that they may or may not ever manage to develop, in the hopes of getting a high valuation and becoming billionaires — solely because other billionaires bought their hype. I recently read a piece where Luke Kemp, a professor with the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge, who has studied the rise and collapse of more than 400 societies over 5,000 years, said we are actually following a really well-worn pattern, in terms of how narcissistic elites bring about the collapse of civilizations. He said, “As elites extract more wealth from the people and the land, they make societies more fragile, leading to infighting, corruption, immiseration of the masses, less healthy people, overexpansion, environmental degradation and poor decision making by a small oligarchy. The hollowed-out shell of a society is eventually cracked asunder by shocks such as disease, war or climate change.”

So, that seems to be the path we're on, because that's the only path the hoarding class knows how to pave. It's not about human nature, but the nature of elites. Our only real hope in the face of that is to create more egalitarian systems. But the conditions that compound our misery are often marketed to us as solutions. We see that with policing, and we see it with attacks on immigrants and trans people. This is why scapegoating exists — to keep us from asking the right questions.

So, with so-called “quality of life” agendas driving surveillance, evictions and criminalization in many cities, what do you think is really being enforced and who's being targeted?

AL: Right. Certainly not quality of life. I mean, you've asked “quality of life,” for whom? Is it quality of life for people who are being criminalized? Is it quality of life for people who are forced into relocation centers or concentration camps? Is it quality of life for people who are at risk of not making rent and being out on the street? No, of course not. We are talking about a regime where the value of housing as a commodity is weighted so much more strongly than the importance of housing as an instrument to actually provide shelter for human beings, right?

That's why we see that when new luxury housing developments get put up, and people get displaced for housing explicitly targeted towards the gentrifying class, in many cases, these buildings sit largely vacant for years after construction, which is a terrible use of housing for shelter, but could still make sense as someone's investment. The value of that land as an asset could still appreciate in value, so it could still be a “rational” use of land as a commodity. And I think of quality of life framings in the same way. It's quality of life for people who have access to money and to resources, people whose lives can have value extracted from them by the owning class. It's not actually “quality of life” for living human beings.

KH: Absolutely, anytime a monied force or government claims to be improving something, we have to ask, who is it being improved for? Who actually reaps the benefit of this change? So, with that in mind, how do tech-driven gentrification projects — like Sidewalk Labs' “Smart Cities” — act as soft tools of authoritarianism, dressed up in the language of “innovation”?

AL: Smart Cities are this idea that we can embed sensors in public spaces. We can collect data on how people use and move and move through and spend money in a city, and we can use all of this data to optimize how a city functions. There was a big push from Sidewalk Labs, a Google subsidiary, to convert the downtown waterfront of Toronto into one large “smart city” to redevelop it, to bring in tech workers, and the people in Toronto successfully fought this off. It was never completed. In alliance with people in San Jose, people in Berlin, Germany, people in San Francisco who were all fighting these Google developments around the same time, none of them were ever completed, in a really inspiring show of transnational solidarity.

So many tech firms make money by collecting raw data, data that had previously not been commodified, and selling it and using it to build predictive models, and using it to sell things back to us. And in the book, I argue that this is a form of primitive accumulation, taking raw material from our shared common world, human data, biographic data, demographic data, and turning it for the first time into a commodity. Smart cities are an attempt to do this on a municipal scale, and I think we should be really worried about that. I think the common discourse in the U.S. would be that this level of data collection would be concerning in an authoritarian country. If this happens in China, it's scary and bad, but because we have a public-private divide in the U.S. and because we have state versus local and federal control, we have all of these divisions of power. For some reason, it's less scary when Google does it or when Meta does it, and I don't think that that is based in the reality of the situation at hand.

I mean, for one thing, there's deep integration and coordination between supposedly private tech firms and the national security and law enforcement apparatuses, a deep, deep connection. And for another thing, these are some of the most powerful institutions on the planet today, talking about large tech firms. They are more powerful than most national governments. I think the fact that they don't have an army and a seat in the UN does not make the authoritarian implications of their centralization of power any less profound.

KH: It's interesting that you brought up the fact that some people think the divisions between the U.S. government and the business world make corporate data collection less scary. While that's never been a valid position, as you say, because these corporations are so entangled with the government, and in of themselves, have so much control over our lives, it is literally less true now than ever. OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI all have federal contracts to develop autonomous AI workflows and scale up AI usage to address national security issues. On August 11, Trump announced that his administration had brokered a deal to take a 15 percent share of Nvidia's H20 chip sales in China. In exchange for those funds, the administration will ease restrictions on sales of the chip in China. And more deals like this are expected. So, you know, so much for the free market.We also know that during the early DOGE free-for-all, Elon Musk's people gained access to vast troves of government data, which includes a lot of our personal data. You have surveillance companies like Palantir getting paid hundreds of millions to bridge government databases that were never meant to be fused. This is a smash-and-grab era of politics. The people at the top are seizing what they can, and information is a huge part of that, whether it's the data that details our lives and habits, or the words and thoughts we produce that can be digested and repurposed into AI slop. 

I actually read an article in The New York Times the other day by the poet Meghan O'Rourke who referred to Large Language Learning Models like ChatGPT as “intellectual Soylent Green” because they're “built from the bodies of the very thing they replace.” We are talking about the hyper-exploitation of every possible site of extraction, and it's really on that terrain that we are talking about trying to hold onto any place or sense of place-making.

Which also brings to mind the prospect of so-called Freedom Cities, which is where I think we could see these corporate dreams of smart cities and totalizing surveillance and control realized. You have people like Curtis Yarvin — a pseudo-intellectual blogger who's pining for a tech dictatorship — pushing a vision, which a lot of these tech billionaires believe in, of this country partitioned into corporate fiefdoms ruled by tech CEOs. What are your thoughts about that?

AL: I think we have an idea in popular culture, at least until the most recent presidential election, that tech workers in California in Silicon Valley were exceptionally progressive individuals, there was the whole idea that tech platforms were censoring conservative voices because everyone who works in tech is a California democratic socialist or something. And what we've seen recently is we've really had a mask-off moment in the tech industry, and we've seen that a lot of these tech workers, tech founders, CEOs are explicitly far right, or willing to cut deals at the very least with the extreme far right.

I don't think that this is surprising for the people who've been fighting gentrification in cities like San Francisco and San Jose and Oakland and Austin, people who've dealt with this industry face-to-face. This has always been an extremely male-dominated, white-dominated industry, with a mentality that they represent some sort of cognitive elite who should naturally have greater political power than other individuals. The idea that they got to where they are because of some sort of functioning meritocracy that makes them better, more intelligent, and more deserving of vast resources than other people. That doesn't mean that every tech worker is a far-right zealot, but there are strong lines of continuity between how this industry is structured and interacts with the communities outside it, and these elitist white supremacist political ideals.

KH: Absolutely. Kate Knibbs recently wrote a piece in Wired about how some tech companies in the U.S. are adopting a so-called “996” workweek. That's 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week — a 72-hour workweek. And while actually putting this demand in job listings is an escalation, even for Silicon Valley, it reflects a culture of extraction and exploitation that's been growing and flourishing for quite some time. None of us should be surprised that the politics of people who are so extreme in their exploitation of workers, both here, and even more so, in other countries, where people can be paid a pittance for work that is exhausting, and sometimes, psychologically damaging — people who are driving up everyday people's electric bills by building water and power-hungry data centers, who are looting people's thoughts and creative and intellectual work, and demanding the courts simply authorize their lawlessness, in the name of progress — of course their politics are the politics of empire.

Sam Altman has said, “Successful people create companies. More successful people create countries. The most successful people create religions.” He's also said that forming a company is “the easiest way” to form a religion. So you have people – whose technology is being fused with governance, by the way – who are really trying to create not only fiefdoms, but religions with themselves at the center. This is true of Sam Altman, it's true of Elon Musk, and they're not alone in that vision.

So, I think we need to reframe a lot of our analysis and critiques, because the escalations of this smash-and-grab period are really changing the terrain and raising the stakes. And on the subject of reframing our analysis, you critique the framing of gentrification as a result of individual consumer behavior. I think this is such an important point. In this age of algorithmic targeting and digital redlining, how should we be updating our analysis?

AL: A lot of the popular discourse on gentrification is one-sided. It's from the perspective of the potential gentrifier. As a housing consumer, is it unethical for me to live in this sort of neighborhood or that sort of neighborhood? How should I feel about my inhabitance of a city? And I think the two things about this discourse are, one, it's never from the perspective of people facing gentrification. It's always from the perspective of the gentrifier, probably because those are the people who write think pieces. And second of all, it's always from the perspective of the consumer, right? Should I consume a housing unit in this neighborhood or in that neighborhood? And that's important, but that's only half of the story, because aside from the question of should I choose to gentrify or not, there's a question of being in a position to identify in the first place.

What we see with gentrification is that this is a side effect of a new economic formation where a small group of people, gentrifiers, largely male, largely white, almost universally with higher elite education, are paid so much, both as owners, as investors, and as privileged workers, that they are able to displace entire communities when they move in. The other, much larger section of people is those who are now paid so little in urban areas that they're at risk of getting priced out. This is the remnants of the urban working class, a formation that previously was crucial to capitalist profits, but now because of outsourcing and automation are so superfluous that displacing them can be a profitable endeavor. I don't think that the individual perspective is unimportant, but we need to look at gentrification, I think to truly understand it as a product of a change in capitalist production, not merely through the ethical lens of consumer choices.

KH: In your book, you write that many traditional strategies on the left were born in a now-defunct urban geography. What approaches do we need to re-evaluate, and what tactics or frameworks are more suited to this moment?

AL: To a large degree, leftist politics are a product of urban revolt. Virtually any branch of leftism has its roots in the Industrial Revolution when cities were growing to house industrial assembly line workers, and these workers were centralized in large workplaces in the key industries of the global economy of the day. When these workers organized, formed a union, walked off the job, they threatened the entire capitalist system: the steel mills, the textile mills, the auto plants.

But today, in today's cities, we actually see the exact opposite dynamic. Poor people are more likely to work in smaller businesses, not huge sprawling assembly lines, if not in the informal or gig economies. Who's being pulled together and centralized in our contemporary cities, not the urban proletariat. For the most part, gentrifiers who are working at huge tech campuses, or in elite universities, they're the people who are getting pulled together and working side by side with one another. But when they revolt, if they were to revolt, it would not be for a universal interest. It would not be for reforming or abolishing capitalist exploitation because they are, for the most part, beneficiaries of that exploitation.

That doesn't mean we have to throw the baby out with the bathwater, but I think that it does mean that we need to reassess and have an openness as the revolutionary left to new forms of fighting and new forms of tactics. If we look at the actual spatial and material conditions around us, we can see that we are on a vastly different terrain than the second Industrial Revolution.

KH: I'm really intrigued by this point. As I was reading your book, I thought about a lot of the smaller unions we're seeing, and how, while it absolutely makes sense for those workers to unionize, and for all of us to support those unions, our worker power is, as you say, largely fragmented. The example you used in the book of a bakery that's employees unionized, that was promptly shuttered by its owner, reminded me of the Gothamist and DNAinfo — publications that were shut down after employees unionized. Workers can break a business, but sometimes, that's all the leverage we have. Of course, there are still unions that have enough heft to shake the system. The Chicago Teachers Union is one that comes to mind, given that they have not only gone on strike multiple times over the last decade and a half, but also bargained for the common good — which is something we need from all unions that actually have the potential to disrupt systems. 

In Defying Displacement, you wrote, “The danger under modern conditions is to hew to the union formed to signal fidelity to the class struggle of the historic left rather than investigate its use as a node in the class struggle around us.” Can you talk about what it means to investigate the role of the union as a node in the class struggle around us? What should that struggle look like?

AL: I think sometimes when we think about class politics, we think exclusively of workplace politics, and I think that that's a big mistake. I think that comes out of our left tradition from a period in time at which there was enormous strategic power in organizing at the site of production in these large crucial industries in growing centralized cities. But I think that it's a mistake to think that class equals workplace for two reasons. I mean, first of all, it discounts all non-waged labor like social reproductive labor, labor in the home, labor in the community. That all gets erased, all of the labor that's necessary for wage labor to even happen.

But I think the second problem is we don't stop having our class positions when we clock out of work. If you're a working class-person or if you are a business owner and you go home, or you go on vacation, or you go to the supermarket, or you're taking care of your home, you are still a worker or an owner or whatever it is. So I think that there are ways… When people are fighting displacement, they're fighting for their class interests. They're fighting for their class interests against another fragment of the working class and the owning class that's seeking to engineer their displacement for reasons of economic interest. This is also the class struggle.

We don't think of union organizing as being very important for the class struggle because someone thought it up in a book. We think of it because of a historic moment where enormous victories were had because of the strategic potentialities of workplace organizing. And I think we need to look and see what those potentialities are in the actually existing struggles around us that we can participate in, not just trying to revive these glory days of union organizing that happened under different economic conditions.

KH: What tactics do you think are more applicable to the moment that we're in?

AL: People will fight for their homes. People will fight for their neighborhoods. People will sacrifice a great deal to know that their elders and their children and their family and their friends will have a place to call home, especially given that because the neighborhoods targeted for “redevelopment” are often ethnic enclaves. When there's a sense of communal meaning and importance and history and language attached to a place, people will fight and people can win. But I think that looking at gentrifying cities actually helps us shine a light on a lot of tactics, even if they aren't explicitly about gentrification.

In 2020, people around the country took the highways. People autonomously took the highways during the George Floyd rebellion. There was no central committee or secret listserv where people came up with a single collective plan: “Everyone go to the highways.” People saw it working in different cities, and then they did that. And this was all coming out of Ferguson, right? When Mike Brown was murdered in Ferguson, and there was a community response in this small suburban excerpt of St. Louis nobody outside of the region had ever heard about, the reason people got mainstream national media attention is someone figured it out. Someone had the tactical innovation that would define the next decade of protest activity in this country and decided to take the highway, decided to take the two lane highway into St. Louis, and that is what caused a massive disruption. That's what brought press, that's what catapulted this movement.

People made the same tactical decision in 2020 to choke off circulation points into, out, and through the city, circulation points that become more and more tactically significant with greater gentrification. As more people are priced out of cities and have to commute back to go to work, these transportation networks become more and more opportune targets. I think this is just one example of how thinking through the spatial terrain and the human distribution over that terrain can illuminate how we think about tactical possibilities.

KH: You talk about our position as laborers not being definitive, or not necessarily being central to our class identity in this moment. I want to stay with that idea for a moment because I think a lot of people are trying to make sense of what's happening in the world right now, and how they should understand their own position in the struggle. We are living under an authoritarian government that is further consolidating power on a daily basis. And I want to state that very clearly: this is not merely the rise of an authoritarian government, or the rise of fascism — the capture of government has occurred. The process of consolidating power is ongoing. Some people are still clinging to institutional guardrails here and there, but those are being ripped apart as well. A lot of people are struggling to reckon with this, which makes the questions that come next, about who we are, and who we are to each other, and what we ought to be doing, even harder to address. But we have to address those questions. 

So how should people be thinking about their class identity, and their sense of relationship to each other, and their sense of place right now? What is a constructive way to form that analysis of one's place in the struggle?

AL: Yeah, I think that there's the knee-jerk reaction for a lot of folks on the left is to want to preserve that worker identity and think of self-identification as a worker as some sort of stable base for the formation of a revolutionary subject, and I have questions about that. I think my politics are oriented towards and rooted in the working class, of course, but I think for that strong identity formation to say, as a worker, as this type of worker, I think that was most prevalent in eras when people basically had to work the same job forever. If you're a mill worker and your parents were mill workers, and your children were mill workers, you better have an identity as a mill worker or else your life doesn't make any sense.

I've worked in a lot of restaurants. It's a precarious industry by design. I don't think I'm going to retire from my current restaurant position. I don't think I'll be working it in five years; no one there does. That's the economy that we're in. People don't stick around long enough to have their current position, I think, be a deep-rooted part of their identity. That doesn't mean they're going to stop being workers, but they're probably going to stop being a certain type of worker at a certain shop … before the revolution. I think that's just the case. 

In the 1960s New Left, people did a lot of thinking about how to identify this type of revolutionary subject. Is it still white industrial workers if white industrial workers are pro-police and pro-the invasion of Vietnam? I think people did a lot of thinking about this sort of subject formation around Occupy when people were talking about the multitude and ways that different identities could come together to form an oppositional subject. And I think we've taken a step back with the idea that we can just pick up the abstract category worker and use that as a coverall when we're thinking of revolutionary subject formation.

I think now is a time where we have to have a little creativity, where we need to really be rooted in the manifold struggles around us, where we need to be doing that creative theoretical work at the grassroots level with one another, and seeing what works for people, what's motivating for folks, what makes sense with the struggles that we have today?

KH: I appreciate that push to think creatively. I also think it's important to think about the various structures and formations that connect us. While labor has long been central to our class analysis, structure-based organizing has always been about more than job sites. We should be thinking about all of the places and group relationships that bind us together, in these times, because those are all sites of potential. A lot of the organizing people have experienced in recent years is what we call self-selecting — as in, I care about this issue, so I am going to engage with this cause. That's important work, but the buy-in involved can be tenuous and potentially fleeting. With structure-based organizing, where we look at organizing our apartment building, our school, or our church, for example, there are already existing relationships and bonded interests to build upon. I am not telling people to abandon self-selecting projects, because those are really important, too. But we definitely need to assess existing points of connection where solidarity could unite and empower us. There's actually a great piece in the summer edition of Hammer & Hope by Benji Hart about how the Concord Missionary Baptist Church in Chicago has organized against anti-Blackness and in support of the migrant community that I hope everyone will check out. 

Of course we still need labor unions, and we need existing unions that have the power to shut things down to wield that power strategically, but as you've talked about, many people have been displaced as workers. They are stranded at a distance from each other, either through the gig economy, or from the actual geography of workplaces that keep people far apart, and engineer a high turnover by design. Amazon warehouses are a good example, in that workers don't work in a friendly proximity to each other, and face such grueling conditions that they are basically being used up and ground out — which the company can afford to do, because there are always more people in search of that income. So under these difficult conditions, what political projects have you found hopeful or impressive?

AL: I think the movement to Stop Cop City, while not ultimately successful at blocking the development of the law enforcement training facility in Atlanta, really shows the kinds of possibilities of pulling different elements of our movements together and having this incredibly politically and tactically diverse movement that brought so many folks together and I think really provided a lodestar for folks across the country in fighting the expansion of police power and gentrification in Atlanta.

I think I also always encourage people to take a transnational look at gentrification because this isn't just a U.S. phenomenon. Mexico City just saw its second, I believe, anti-gentrification march. The first one was on July 4th because entire neighborhoods in Mexico City are being effectively colonized by American “expat digital nomads.” We saw a huge movement in Berlin to block the expansion of a Google office plan for there. I am very interested in fostering new forms of transnational solidarities between global cities fighting the same adversaries. I don't think we've had the objective conditions for that to be possible before the last few years. So I think this is a huge opportunity for popular forces to build connections and try to outmaneuver some of these institutions whose whole business model is playing off cities against each other in a race to the bottom.

KH: Can you say more about international struggles that you think U.S.-based organizers can learn from?

AL: When we were organizing against a Google development in San Jose, California, in the so-called Silicon Valley, we formed connections with folks in San Francisco; Toronto, Canada; and Berlin, Germany that were also in simultaneous fights against Google campuses in their cities. We had a week of action where we had identical banners and messaging and actions in San Jose, San Francisco, Toronto, and Berlin, and I do not think that Google's PR team was ready for that. I don't think that was on their bingo card for things that could possibly happen. 

The housing market in the United States has become financialized, simply meaning that it's largely controlled by national and transnational financial institutions, not just local rich people, since the 2008 Great Recession. We now have the possibility for housing fights where your fight in Cincinnati, you might be fighting the same people who are being fought in Albuquerque or who are being fought in Seattle. That's new. 

The explosion of tech campuses after the dot-com boom into the present day where they're playing city governments off one another, as in the case of Amazon's HQ2 a few years ago, to get the best tax breaks, to save the most money, to get the best deals on land. All of these cities have an objective basis for solidarity with one another. That's also new, as is the fact that they're not only playing American cities with cities across the world off against each other. So now we have gentrification happening as a real social struggle, not only across the United States, but in cities across the Americas and around the world. We have a new basis for transnational solidarity, for housing justice, and community liberation that did not exist before 2008.

KH: You mentioned tech campuses, and I want to talk a bit about the evolution of campuses as an extractive force. I live fairly close to a university campus and have for about 20 years now, and I have watched the creep and expansion as the university has served as a gentrifying force in the neighborhood, subsuming buildings and businesses, and changing the face of the area. I've seen campaigns to stop the university from closing beloved cultural venues and a local community garden. 

Elsewhere, we've also seen the rise of tech campuses, which insulate tech employees from the people they're pricing out. And more recently, we see AI companies creating what they call “AI campuses” which sound like places where people study AI, but they are really just massive, sprawling data centers that devour enormous amounts of water and electricity, and produce pollution that harms local ecosystems and communities. So the word “campus” — which I think most people attach to the idea of shared space for shared learning — has been increasingly used to brand spaces of extraction as if they were centers of enlightenment.

Campus urbanism is playing a central role in the pacification of our communities. How should people of conscience inside these institutions understand their social position?

AL: Yeah, I think the first thing is to look at the functioning of campuses. What are campuses designed to do? Thinking about tech office campuses or university campuses, university campuses are the model. University campuses are not a universal phenomenon. In many countries, when people go to university, they will go to one close by their home and keep living in their family home. The idea that people of a certain class background move away from home to go to a campus where you have all of your needs met, where you have housing and recreation and food and leisure activities all at your school, that's a very American phenomenon.

It was actually created for a purpose, because in the early 20th century, what were formerly rural schools began being surrounded by large encroaching cities. The people who ran these universities were scared that their students would talk to poor people. If they were talking to poor people and doing poor people things, they weren't learning and doing the life of the mind. Woodrow Wilson, who was a [Princeton alum], said that the purpose of a campus is to protect elite students from the “majority who carry forward the common labor of the world.” That's the purpose of a campus is that separation, forming really strong bonds and a form of solidarity between those inside, and a total separation from those on the outside, even when the people on the outside are on the campus to clean, to cook, to serve its members.

The existence of a campus in its most basic sense, I think needs to be problematized because it is a racist and classist structure, that division that it creates by making an elite privileged in-group and effectively erasing the rest of the world. That is what it's designed to do. When I was organizing in Silicon Valley, I found that a lot of people who worked in tech seemed to think that everyone in Silicon Valley worked in tech.

The overwhelming majority of people in the so-called Silicon Valley do not work Silicon Valley jobs. The only reason people think that is because they're on the eBay or Adobe or Google or Meta campus, and so you only ever interact as humans with other members of the campus, or you're at a networking event or a boot camp. I don't really know that many things that tech people do, rock climbing, and you're talking to other people who are also in the same position as you, so it seems like everyone must be a software engineer. And that's the same thing that university campuses are designed to create. Everyone's a student, and no one else exists. Even the people who serve you food every day, even if they're your same age, they don't count. They aren't inside the campus even if they're standing on its grounds. And we can't have any sort of liberatory politics or practice from within these institutions that does not break that division down as an urgent political task.

KH: What would breaking that division down as part of a liberatory politics look like?

AL: I think campus politics can't just be about students and grad students and professors. They have to be about the communities the university is encroaching upon. They need to be about the service industry workers who don't get to be part of the campus. I don't think that progressive tech politics can just be a conversation between tech workers. I think they need to grapple with the way that their industry and their peers are displacing and gentrifying communities. I think there needs to be a real effort to break down those walls because that division is what makes a system run.

KH: That makes a lot of sense, and I also really hope that some folks who are operating within these systems that isolate and benefit them will take the long view. Because that kind of isolation from harm is not permanent. Students who attend universities that wall them off from workers and poor people living in struggle ultimately wind up living at the mercy of a lot of the same conditions once they're no longer a source of revenue for the university. I feel like I was part of the last generation that had a precedented reason to believe there would be good paying jobs waiting for us after college, but we promptly learned otherwise. People studied the humanities, and found out there were no jobs. People were told to learn graphic design, and they did, and then those jobs went away. People were told to learn to code — and now the tech field is being destabilized as well. The point is that if you're not in the very top tier of people benefiting from exploitation and extraction, there is no safety. There are just periods in which you are momentarily more valuable to the people exploiting us, but that's not a fixed condition. It's really just a matter of how long that cycle lasts and who's around to actually give a fuck when you're the one being disgarded and displaced. 

AL: Yes, absolutely.

KH: So, as we wrap things up, I want to return to your argument that displacement is “the leading edge of confrontation with the contemporary ruling class.” How should we be reframing the housing struggle as a terrain of class war?

AL: I think some people on the left have thought of housing struggles as an afterthought. The idea that the real work is at the workplace or it's building the party, or it's forming some sort of collective, and that anti-gentrification work doesn't have the same sort of credentials for some on the left. I think that's a deeply mistaken view. When people are fighting for the preservation of their community, when people are fighting some of the most powerful institutions on the planet, we need to pick a side.

I think going back to your early example of a unionized bakery that folds, yeah, that never touches the capitalist class writ large. That's not a threat to the system by itself. But some of these fights against neighborhood displacement come up almost immediately against Fortune 500 companies and the entire state apparatus. I think there's something that very much needs to be explored, and materially supported in that, because again, we don't shed our class positions when we're talking about rent. We don't shed our class positions when we're talking about sustainable housing. Those are still coming from our positions within capitalist production, and it is just another train of struggle in that same fight.

KH: Well said. Is there anything else you would like to share with or ask of the audience today?

AL: I just want to say that things are admittedly dire in the U.S. and around the world, and I still remain full of revolutionary optimism for what lies ahead. The military gentrification of D.C., deploying the military for quality-of-life policing, is not the move that powerful, stable nation states make. Trying to ram through deeply unpopular cop cities in dozens of cities around the country is not what a stable ruling elite that is not afraid of the people it rules over does. I think a lot of what we're seeing today are signs of the thinness of imperial and capitalist power, and I just hope that we can all keep going together.

KH: Thank you for that. I think we should also understand these hyper militant actions as efforts to terrorize people of conscience who might otherwise advocate for themselves and each other. While most of us are not among the most impacted by these actions — and should be doing all that we can to support those most impacted, and people organizing in support of those communities — this administration is seeking to terrorize us with these actions. They are trying to break our sense of relationship to each other, or prevent us from forming the sense of relationship we need, by instilling fear. And I would also agree that so much of what we are seeing, from ramped up militancy to billionaires building bunkers, is a reflection of the unstable situation the ruling class has created. As Dr. Luke Kemp explained, this spiraling inequality is unsustainable. It's the stuff collapse is made of. The people that rule us want to police, displace, and dispose of us as needed to maintain their position for as long as possible. What we need, in order to create structures and systems that might give us a fighting chance, is each other, and that's why they want us immobilized and afraid. So, let's remember that, and let's connect and build. Because that is where all our hope lies.

Andrew, I want to thank you so much for joining me today. I really appreciated the opportunity to discuss your book, Defying Displacement, and to talk about gentrification, and ways that we can innovate within the class struggle.

AL: Thank you so much.

KH: I also want to thank our listeners for joining us today, and remember, our best defense against cynicism is to do good, and to remember that the good we do matters. Until next time, I'll see you in the streets.

The Department of Education suspended a program that forgives any remaining student debt after 300 payments.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

A group of Democratic senators is demanding answers from the Department of Education (DOE) on its decision to renege on its obligation to 3 million student loan borrowers enrolled in the Income-Based Repayment program, which forgives any remaining student debt after 300 payments, which typically takes about 25 years. 

“We write to express our strong opposition to the Department of Education's (‘the department') recent action to suspend forgiveness under the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) Program and to demand information on behalf of the millions of student loan borrowers who have been stripped of their ability to access forgiveness for which they are entitled to under law,” the senators wrote in a letter to DOE.

“It is unacceptable,” they continued, “for the Trump administration to take any action that delays or denies legally mandated debt relief to borrowers that have been in repayment for over two decades or more.”

The letter was sent by Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), Tim Kaine (D-Virginia), Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon), Peter Welch (D-Vermont), Ron Wyden (D-Oregon), Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut), Alex Padilla (D-California), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) and Jack Reed (D-Rhode Island).

While many borrowers wait to receive the debt relief owed to them, the Department of Homeland Security has announced that it's offering Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) recruits student loan forgiveness up to $60,000. Trump's so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” will further punish the average student loan borrower, as it's expected to significantly increase loan payments. 

The Department of Education “quietly made the decision to suspend IBR forgiveness,” the senators wrote. “This decision was made without first notifying Congress or borrowers that the department would pause forgiveness under the program.” 

DOE not only failed to inform Congress, it appears the department misled federal lawmakers about the status of the program. On July 17, in a briefing to Congress, DOE said it was continuing to process forgiveness for IBR borrowers. However, a few days later, The Washington Post reported that DOE had indefinitely suspended forgiveness in early July.

After news of the pause broke, the department claimed it had temporarily suspended forgiveness because of a court injunction preventing implementation of the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) program, which is an entirely different loan forgiveness program.

The senators pushed back on DOE's claim, writing that the “injunction has been in place for several months, so it is not clear why the department has suddenly — months after the injunction went into place — decided to pause forgiveness that is clearly required by law and not the subject of ongoing litigation.”

The department has not provided a timeline for when it will resume forgiveness, “which is alarming considering many borrowers have already been waiting months for relief,” the senators wrote. DOE has said that borrowers who should have their debt discharged during the pause will receive a refund once forgiveness resumes.

“[B]orrowers who have been repaying for decades should not be expected to continue paying beyond the 20- or 25-year timeframe required in law, and the department has provided no assurance that refund payments will be made quickly or in a timely manner,” the senators wrote. “The department should not require borrowers who have fulfilled their legal repayment obligations to continue paying with no guarantee or timeline for relief.”

Since talks collapsed between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Hanoi, in 2019, North Korea's reckless drive for long-range nuclear capabilities has fueled tensions on the Korean Peninsula to new heights. But Pyongyang's provocations obscure a deeper shift in the region: China's growing reluctance to rein in its troublesome ally. For years, Beijing has played a crucial role in bringing North Korea to the negotiating table, and it has at times been a key partner in international efforts to curb North Korea's nuclear and missile ambitions. China has supported UN Security Council resolutions to inhibit North Korea's nuclear program and even worked with Washington to tighten sanctions against Pyongyang, despite criticism from Russia for doing so. But in the face of its growing rivalry with the United States, China has quietly stepped back from this cooperative approach.

In recent months, some foreign policy experts in Washington and Seoul have grown cautiously optimistic that the “comprehensive strategic partnership” forged between North Korea and Russia, in 2024, might draw China back in. Beijing's reserved response to Pyongyang's provision of weapons and combat troops to support Russia's war in Ukraine—dismissing it as a bilateral matter between Pyongyang and Moscow—betrays a thinly veiled discomfort with its smaller ally's latest gambit. At the same time, observers in Washington and Seoul have become hopeful that growing public support in South Korea for developing an independent nuclear deterrent might provide Beijing with another compelling reason to renew its efforts to restrain the North's belligerence.

Reinvigorating joint U.S.-Chinese efforts to curb North Korea's nuclear program is indeed possible. Both great powers continue to publicly endorse some level of denuclearization. In May 2024, China, Japan, and South Korea issued a joint declaration reaffirming their commitment to a Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons. In February 2025, the Trump administration issued its own trilateral statement with Tokyo and Seoul, pledging to pursue the complete denuclearization of North Korea. But many of the pathways recently proposed for incentivizing Beijing's cooperation rest on shaky assumptions. Analysts in Washington and Seoul often overestimate the impact that tensions between China and North Korea will have on their relationship. Despite the many historical periods of unease between the two countries, China's policy toward North Korea's nuclear program has been shaped more by its broader strategic calculations vis-à-vis the United States than by frustration with its defiant ally.

Likewise, the belief that North Korea's increasing closeness with Russia will rupture Beijing's relationship with Pyongyang is misplaced. History suggests the opposite: Beijing has been more, not less, likely to tighten its ties with Pyongyang when North Korea is drifting toward Moscow. In the late 1960s, for example, China deliberately strengthened its ties to North Korea in fear that Pyongyang was tilting toward the Soviet Union.

Hoping that the possibility of South Korean nuclearization might spur Chinese cooperation on North Korea is equally misguided, and the prospect could even backfire. Rather than inducing cooperation, such a move could trigger a harsh response from Beijing. South Korea's deployment, in 2016, of the U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, for example—intended to counter North Korean missile threats—prompted sweeping economic retaliation from China. Chinese tourism to South Korea plunged by two-thirds between 2016 and 2017, and sales of South Korean cars, such as Hyundai and Kia, dropped by more than half in China. The development of a South Korean nuclear weapons program could trigger even harsher punishment—and might lead Beijing to tacitly accept further advances in North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities.

If Washington wants China to cooperate on containing Pyongyang's aggression, it should focus on reassuring Beijing about its core strategic interests—above all, Taiwan. The history of negotiations over North Korea's nuclear program shows that China has been more amenable to working with the United States when it feels secure about its vital interests, and no interest matters more to Beijing than preventing Taiwan's independence—an issue that U.S. policy can directly shape. Beijing has repeatedly used its cooperation on the North Korean issue as leverage to push the United States to hold the line on Taiwan. By reaffirming the United States' “one China” policy and signaling a continued U.S. willingness to restrain Taipei's unilateral moves toward independence, the Trump administration could nudge Beijing toward resuming its efforts to curb Pyongyang.

Such diplomacy need not take the form of a sweeping “grand bargain.” Instead, a more limited, realistic arrangement—focused on managing and reducing the risk of military conflict on the Korean Peninsula and in the Taiwan Strait—offers a more viable path. With a narrowly defined scope and clear set of boundaries, Washington and Beijing could lower tensions and preserve stability in East Asia at a time when the world can ill afford another conflict or crisis.

Beijing has long viewed North Korea as both a dangerous liability and a strategic asset. Above all, China fears that its unpredictable and often aggressive client state could spark a military conflict with South Korea and the United States, potentially dragging Beijing into a second Korean War. Even short of provoking outright conflict, North Korea's advancing nuclear and missile capabilities still threaten to trigger a regional arms race. The United States and its allies have already expanded missile defense deployments in East Asia, which Beijing views as a direct threat to its strategic deterrence capabilities. Although China retaliated against South Korea for deploying THAAD in 2016, Chinese state media acknowledged that North Korea bore some responsibility. A 2017 commentary in China's state-run Global Times, for example, blamed Pyongyang for giving Washington and Seoul a justification for THAAD deployment and argued that the North's provocation had harmed China's strategic interests.

Beijing is also acutely aware of the risks posed by its shared border with North Korea. Pyongyang's continuing nuclear and missile developments could invite new rounds of international sanctions, potentially crippling North Korea's already fragile economy and causing a refugee crisis in northeast China. Nearly half of North Korea's known major nuclear sites lie within 30 miles of the shared border, making any nuclear mishap—whether caused by an accident in North Korean operations or a preemptive U.S. strike—a possible environmental disaster for China. Beijing's worst strategic nightmare is a unified Korean Peninsula under Seoul's leadership, with a continued U.S. military presence, which a sudden collapse of the North Korean regime could produce.



For all these reasons, China has long regarded Pyongyang's nuclear program as a headache and has consistently affirmed denuclearization as a policy goal. Chinese President Xi Jinping even openly warned Pyongyang, in 2013, that “no one should be allowed to throw a region and even the whole world into chaos for selfish gains.” At times, Beijing has taken harsh measures toward North Korea—including temporarily suspending oil shipments, restricting Chinese tourism, and applying financial sanctions to the North—although such efforts have typically been short-lived and halfhearted.

But North Korea also serves China's strategic interests in two important ways—both with respect to Taiwan. First, in the event of a military showdown over Taiwan, North Korea could help tie down, or at least distract, U.S. forces in the western Pacific, forcing Washington to keep a substantial number of its military assets in the Korean theater. This logic is not new. As early as 2007, the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association—a quasi-official body under the auspices of the Chinese foreign ministry—asserted in its annually published yearbook that Taiwan and North Korea were “intrinsically linked.” An immediate North Korean threat might also dissuade Seoul from supporting any U.S. military operations beyond the peninsula. If Beijing were ever to conclude that force was the only path to unification with Taiwan, it might be more inclined to tolerate—or even shield—North Korea's nuclear and missile programs because a nuclear-armed North Korea could, in theory, help create a more favorable strategic environment for Chinese military operations across the Taiwan Strait.

Beijing has also long viewed its cooperation on the North Korean nuclear issue as a source of leverage to push for U.S. accommodation of its interests on Taiwan. Since the early 2000s, Chinese officials and strategists have made it clear, both privately and publicly, that they expect reciprocity on the two issues. In 2003, a Chinese official told The Washington Post that China was “not linking the issues. . . . But what we are saying is this: The United States cannot expect us to continually give unless it gives us something, too.” According to the political scientist Zhao Quansheng, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhou Wenzhong acknowledged to him, in 2005, that Beijing had worked with Washington on North Korean denuclearization partly to elicit U.S. cooperation on Taiwan (noting, however, that Beijing had used the linkage strategy very cautiously). In 2008, according to a U.S. diplomatic cable published by Wikileaks, Yang Jiemian—the head of the government-affiliated think tank Shanghai Institute for International Studies and brother of then Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi—suggested to senior U.S. officials that the United States could coordinate with China on the Taiwan issue in exchange for China's help restraining North Korea's nuclear ambitions. And in 2019, amid rising tensions between Washington and Beijing over Taiwan and stalled negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang, Chinese foreign policy experts warned that Beijing's willingness to help move the negotiations forward would hinge on the United States' approach to its relations with China and argued that U.S. violations of China's redline on Taiwan were partly to blame for the deadlock.

Since the early 1990s, Beijing's willingness to rein in North Korea's nuclear ambitions has followed a discernible pattern. When Beijing perceived Washington to be more willing to play ball on Taiwan and felt secure about its interests regarding the island, Chinese leaders were more willing to pressure North Korea. But when the United States took steps that Beijing perceived as threatening to its position on Taiwan, China became more reluctant to cooperate—sometimes even overtly shielding the North.

The first North Korean nuclear crisis erupted in 1993, when Pyongyang declared its intention to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, after facing pressure from the International Atomic Energy Agency to allow inspections of suspected nuclear sites. At the time, U.S.-Chinese relations were still recovering from the fallout of Beijing's crackdown on the 1989 protests in Tiananmen Square. Beijing, still resentful of U.S. sanctions and criticism of its record on human rights, declined to formally participate in the negotiations over North Korea's nuclear program. But China did play an active behind-the-scenes role, serving as an informal intermediary between Washington and Pyongyang. China did not vote in favor of a UN Security Council resolution calling for North Korea to comply with IAEA safeguards, but by abstaining, it allowed the measure to pass. According to U.S. diplomats involved in the negotiations, Beijing also signaled that it would abstain from a Security Council resolution to impose limited sanctions on Pyongyang, and warned that if such sanctions were adopted, it would cut off oil and food supplies to North Korea. These moves helped convince Pyongyang to come to the negotiating table, where it agreed, under the 1994 Agreed Framework signed with the United States, to give up its nuclear program in exchange for energy assistance. China did not seek U.S. assurances on Taiwan in return for its cooperation, partly because Beijing remained confident that Washington would maintain only unofficial ties with the island—but that faith would soon falter.

The second North Korean nuclear crisis broke out in October 2002, when the United States accused Pyongyang of operating a clandestine uranium-enrichment program that violated the 1994 Agreed Framework. This time, China played a far more active diplomatic role, partly because the strategic context had shifted. Beijing's latent confidence in U.S. unofficial ties with Taiwan had been shaken by the 1995–96 Taiwan Strait crisis, when Washington allowed Taiwanese leader Lee Teng-hui to visit Cornell University, where he had studied. Beijing viewed this as a breach of the U.S. pledge to conduct relations with Taiwan on a strictly unofficial basis, and responded with military drills in the Taiwan Strait. Then, in 2000, Taiwan elected Chen Shui-bian from the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as president. When, in August 2002, Chen claimed that “one country exists on each side of the Taiwan Strait” and proposed to hold a referendum on Taiwan's formal independence, Beijing became even more unsettled. During a summit with President George W. Bush in Texas that October, Chinese President Jiang Zemin urged Washington to go beyond merely “not supporting” Taiwan's independence and to explicitly “oppose” it. At the same summit, he pledged China's cooperation with the United States on the North Korean nuclear issue. In December 2003, while standing next to visiting Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, Bush publicly rebuked Chen, declaring, “We oppose any unilateral decision by either China or Taiwan to change the status quo,” and warning that Chen's comments and actions indicated that “he may be willing to make decisions unilaterally to change the status quo, which we oppose.”



As North Korea continued advancing its nuclear program, Beijing played a major part in the international efforts to halt and roll it back. In August 2003, Beijing helped launch the Six-Party Talks, hosting Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea, and the United States to further these efforts. In September 2006, Beijing suspended oil exports to North Korea for a month to dissuade Pyongyang from conducting a nuclear test. When Pyongyang went ahead with the test anyway, Beijing issued a statement denouncing North Korea's action as hanran, or “blatant”—a rare and unusually strong public condemnation of its ally by Chinese standards—and temporarily suspended financial transactions between major Chinese banks and North Korea. The talks ultimately collapsed in 2009, after Pyongyang withdrew and carried out a second nuclear test. But China, reassured by Washington's stance on Taiwan, had shown a consistent willingness to pressure its longtime ally.

Between 2009 and 2017, as cross-strait tensions eased, China took an even harder line on North Korea. The election of Ma Ying-jeou, from the Beijing-friendly Kuomintang party, as Taiwan's president in 2008 ushered in a period of considerably better ties between Taipei and Beijing. Worrying less about Taiwan, Beijing increasingly viewed North Korea's nuclear provocations as a threat to China's security interests rather than as an insurance policy against Taiwan's independence. Beijing resented the repeated North Korean nuclear and missile tests, which gave Washington and Seoul justification to strengthen their military cooperation, which they did by deploying systems such as THAAD and intensifying joint military exercises. China therefore voted in favor of multiple rounds of UN sanctions against North Korea—in 2009, 2013, 2016, and 2017—and its tone toward Pyongyang grew more critical. Chinese strategists began openly suggesting that Beijing should abandon Pyongyang, and senior Chinese officials increasingly emphasized that Chinese–North Korean ties were “normal” state-to-state relations rather than a “blood alliance,” as they had traditionally been described. In a clear signal of Beijing's frustration, Xi visited South Korea during his second year in office, in 2014, before he visited North Korea, breaking the tradition that a new Chinese leader visit Pyongyang before Seoul. When U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Taiwanese President-elect Tsai Ing-wen (of the DPP) spoke over the phone in December 2016, China protested. But Trump refused to grant Tsai a second call, primarily out of concern that it might derail Chinese cooperation on North Korea, likely helping sustain Beijing's willingness to continue exerting pressure Pyongyang through 2017.

Starting in 2018, however, things began to shift. During Trump's first term, a bipartisan consensus emerged in Washington favoring a tougher policy toward China, which, as Beijing continued escalating pressure on Taipei, also meant strengthening relations with Taiwan. Against this backdrop, North Korea once again looked more like a strategic asset than a liability for Beijing. In March, just days after the White House announced Trump's summit with Kim and after Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encouraged exchanges between U.S. and Taiwanese officials, Xi hosted Kim in Beijing for his first visit to China. Xi told Kim that the traditional bond between the two countries “should not and would not be altered by a single period of time or a single issue,” signaling his renewed commitment to the partnership. That September, Beijing sent Li Zhanshu, the Chinese Communist Party's number three official, to attend North Korea's founding day military parade. To be sure, China's abrupt shift was also driven by its concern that a breakthrough in U.S.–North Korean relations could marginalize China on the Korean Peninsula. Beijing did believe, however, that direct U.S.–North Korean dialogue could lower tensions in ways that would ultimately serve China's security interests.



As U.S.-Chinese tensions over Taiwan ratcheted up in 2019 and 2020—fueled by growing Chinese pressure on the island, major U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, and multiple high-level U.S. officials' visits to Taipei—Beijing grew more overt in its support for Pyongyang, even as North Korea resumed missile tests and refused diplomatic engagement with the United States. In June 2019, Xi visited North Korea for the first time as China's leader. In March 2020, Chinese State Councilor Wang Yi praised the “positive steps” Pyongyang had taken toward denuclearization and blamed the United States for having failed to reciprocate those efforts and for causing the deadlock in negotiations. That fall, at a ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of China's entry into the Korean War, Xi revived the description of the two countries' relationship as one “forged with blood.”

China's support for North Korea peaked early in the Biden administration, as Beijing perceived Washington's posture to be increasingly confrontational, particularly on Taiwan. Two joint statements issued by the United States in 2021, with Japan in April and South Korea in May, emphasized the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. President Joe Biden's repeated off-the-cuff remarks suggesting a U.S. commitment to Taiwan's defense in the event of a Chinese attack, although consistently walked back by administration officials, further alarmed Chinese leaders.

It was in this context that China renewed its mutual assistance treaty with North Korea in July 2021. When Pyongyang intensified its missile testing in the spring of 2022—including the launch of three ballistic missiles capable of reaching the continental United States—China, along with Russia, vetoed a U.S.-proposed UN Security Council resolution calling for additional sanctions against Pyongyang. This marked China's first and only veto, to date, of a resolution targeting North Korea, and it came just three days after Biden made remarks suggesting, for the third time, that the United States had an obligation to defend Taiwan. In August, Pyongyang returned the favor by condemning U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, echoing Beijing's outrage.

As Washington and Beijing took steps to de-escalate tensions following Pelosi's visit, China's overt support for North Korea began to recede. At the Biden-Xi summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022, Biden reaffirmed the United States' adherence to the “one China” policy and its opposition to unilateral changes to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. (He also refrained from repeating his earlier remarks about U.S. commitments to Taiwan's defense.) This more cautious approach continued through the trilateral summit at Camp David, in August 2023, where the United States, Japan, and South Korea issued a joint statement reaffirming that there was “no change in our basic positions on Taiwan” and urged a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues. Beijing, for its part, quietly dialed down its engagement with Pyongyang. When North Korea celebrated the anniversary of the end of the Korean War and the Kim regime's founding, in July and September, respectively, Beijing sent the Politburo member Li Hongzhong and Vice Premier Liu Guozhong—two officials who ranked well below Li Zhanshu, who attended the same events in 2018.

Continued affirmation of the official U.S. position on Taiwan has coincided with China's continued willingness to scale back its support for North Korea. In response to Taiwan's election of the DPP presidential candidate Lai Ching-te in January 2024, whom Beijing views as a staunch advocate of Taiwan's independence, Biden pronounced, “We do not support independence.” The State Department further emphasized the U.S. commitment to advancing the unofficial U.S.-Taiwanese relationship in a way consistent with its “one China” policy. Two months later, when the UN Security Council voted on whether to renew the mandate of an independent expert panel monitoring North Korea's violations of UN sanctions, China abstained (although Russia again vetoed the measure). And in May, China reaffirmed its support for denuclearization in a joint statement with Japan and South Korea. Pyongyang responded furiously, calling the statement a “grave political provocation.”

Even with Beijing's recent distancing from North Korea, and Washington's reaffirmation of its position on Taiwan, the risk of miscalculation over either issue remains dangerously high—high enough that the United States and China could be dragged into a direct military confrontation. A conflict in the Taiwan Strait or on the Korean Peninsula—or worse, in both—could quickly spiral into a broader war with devastating global consequences.

To mitigate this risk, some analysts have proposed that the United States should seek a “grand bargain” with China. According to this view, Washington could make major concessions on Taiwan, such as explicitly ruling out military intervention in the event of a crisis in Taiwan, in exchange for Beijing's accommodation of U.S. interests on issues such as North Korea, the South China Sea, and trade. But there is little, if any, appetite in Washington these days for any such grand bargain. More fundamentally, the proposed idea rests on the flawed assumption that great powers can exert total control over their smaller partners. Client states have agency. As both Beijing's experience dealing with Pyongyang and, to a lesser extent, Washington's experience with Taipei demonstrate, these smaller partners are not mere pawns to be traded away. They can act unilaterally in ways that complicate their patrons' strategic goals.

The other end of the policy spectrum is barely a bargain at all. Some analysts argue that China and the United States should base negotiations on single issues, instead of chasing an ambitious but unlikely grand bargain. Single-issue bargaining, however, can reinforce a zero-sum mindset, making it harder to generate the mutual gains needed to reach agreements.



Rather than choosing between these extremes, Washington should pursue a middle path: a focused effort to work with Beijing to manage and reduce military risks on the Korean Peninsula and in the Taiwan Strait. Such a cross-issue bargaining approach would offer a higher chance of success than single-issue negotiations because it creates possibilities for side deals that would be unattainable were the bargaining to remain confined to a single issue area.

To that end, the United States should leverage China's willingness to rein in North Korea when it feels secure about its vital interests, especially Taiwan. The Trump administration should consistently and publicly reaffirm key elements of the “one China” policy, underscoring the unofficial nature of U.S.-Taiwan relations, pronouncing U.S. opposition to unilateral changes to the status quo by either Beijing or Taipei, and reiterating that the United States does not support Taiwan's independence. Such assurances would both reduce North Korea's strategic value to China and reinforce the perception in Beijing that Pyongyang's recklessness—not Taipei's actions—is the greatest threat to regional stability and to China's strategic interests. China, for its part, should consider easing its military, economic, and diplomatic pressure campaigns against Taiwan—steps that would not only lower cross-strait tensions and advance Beijing's stated goal of peaceful unification, by appealing to the “hearts and minds” of the Taiwanese people, but also better protect Washington from domestic criticism of its efforts to reassure Beijing on the Taiwan issue.

At the same time, China should press North Korea, even if only in private, to refrain from new nuclear tests, suspend intercontinental ballistic missile launches, scale back short-range missile tests, and reengage in dialogue with the new South Korean government to reduce hostilities and military tensions. If Pyongyang were to meet these conditions, Washington should, in coordination with Seoul and Beijing, consider calibrated steps toward diplomatic reengagement with North Korea and limited sanctions relief.



This middle ground approach is more politically feasible than a grand bargain—in both Washington and Bejing—because it would not demand a fundamental shift in either side's long-standing policy toward its respective smaller partner. It would not require China to abandon North Korea or the United States to forsake Taiwan. Instead, it recognizes that the two great powers share a fundamental interest in preventing a catastrophic war in East Asia even as both face limits on how far they can—or are willing to—go in restraining their partners.

Precisely because of those limits, such a framework would be brittle. Washington and Beijing must therefore maintain realistic expectations and tolerance for imperfection. Pyongyang and Taipei are autonomous actors, capable of resisting pressure by their patrons and of taking action to force their patrons' hands. Sustaining cooperation will also require that the United States and China remain dedicated to a narrowly focused joint effort. Any attempts to bundle in other contentious issues such as trade, technology, or critical minerals would likely doom the entire arrangement, increasing the risk that disagreements in one area would derail progress in others.

If the United States hopes to constrain North Korea's nuclear program, it will need at least tacit support from China—and ideally, Beijing's active cooperation. Progress will not be linear, but there is precedent for it. Between 2002 and 2008, active diplomatic efforts by Washington and Beijing worked to curb very real risks of military conflict, on both the Korean Peninsula and across the Taiwan Strait. A joint risk control and reduction framework would not be a perfect solution to the underlying disputes over North Korea and Taiwan, but it could function as a stabilizing guardrail, minimizing the risk of escalatory spirals and creating space for leaders to explore more durable security arrangements for the region.

            Tennis superstar Coco Gauff has parted ways with her coach just days before this year's US Open, according to reports, including ESPN, on Wednesday.
    


            The two-time grand slam singles winner has not publicly announced the decision, but reports suggest coach Matthew Daly will no longer be part of her team.
    


CNN Sports has reached out to Gauff's representatives for comment.
    


            “Only have good things to say about Coco, enjoyed working with her,” Daly told Bounces, adding that the decision was made “recently.”
    


            Reports state that Gauff will continue working with her longtime coach Jean-Christophe Faurel, while also bringing in biomechanics specialist Gavin MacMillan.
    


            The world No. 3 was seen practicing with her new coaching team in New York this week, according to Reuters, with particular attention being paid to her serve and forehand.
    


Coco Gauff reacts to winning the French Open



            MacMillan, who works across various sports, has been widely credited for helping current world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka improve her serve.
    


            Serving has been a problem area for Gauff in recent months, with the American hitting 42 double faults in just three matches at the Canadian Open earlier this month, according to Reuters.
    


            Under the partnership of Daly and Faurel, though, Gauff produced some of her best tennis, winning both last year's WTA Finals and this year's French Open.
    


            But the 21-year-old has struggled with form in recent months, crashing out of Wimbledon in the first round after losing to the then world No. 42 Dayana Yastremska.
    


            Gauff will look to rectify her dip in performance at this year's US Open, where she won the 2023 edition and will be one of the biggest stars in the draw.
    


            The singles tournament is set to start on Sunday, with the draw taking place later Thursday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","North Korea has a secret missile base that poses a ‘potential nuclear threat' to the US, new report says","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/21/asia/north-korea-secret-missile-base-china-intl-hnk","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 07:10:00 GMT","


North Korea has a secret, previously unreported missile base near its northern border with China, which could pose a “potential nuclear threat” to much of East Asia and the United States, according to a new report released Wednesday.
    


            The Sinpung-dong missile base is located just 27 kilometers (about 17 miles) from the China border. It's believed to store up to nine nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) as well as their mobile launchers, said the report by Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).
    


            The site is one of the estimated 15 to 20 ballistic missile bases and warhead storage facilities that North Korea has never declared, said the report, which drew from satellite image analysis, interviews with North Korean refugees and officials, declassified documents and open-source data.
    


            “These missiles pose a potential nuclear threat to East Asia and the continental United States,” the report warned.
    


            North Korea has ramped up its weapons program in the last few years under leader Kim Jong Un, rapidly modernizing its armed forces, developing new weapons and testing intercontinental ballistic missiles that can reach almost anywhere in the United States.
    


            Those actions are in violation of United Nations sanctions that strictly limit North Korea's access to materials and weapons. But the isolated nation has also ramped up its cooperation with Russia since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, sending troops to fight on the frontlines – raising fears that Moscow could help boost Pyongyang's technologies and supply lines in return.
    


Why Trump's strikes on Iran will leave North Korea more determined than ever to keep its nukes



            This secret base is part of North Korea's effort to bolster its nuclear program, the report said.
    


            The base sits in a narrow mountain valley, cut in half by a stream, and measures 22 square kilometers (about 5,436 acres) – bigger than New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport.
    


            Experts say that its location near the border lends a geographical advantage – countries like the United States might be wary of targeting it since any fallout could impact adjacent China.
    


            “By building bases so close to China, North Korea may also seek to leverage the political risk and uncertainty of Beijing's response in order to deter an attack,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.
    


            “US and South Korean policymakers are already aware of Pyongyang's unwillingness to trade away these capabilities in disarmament diplomacy, but public knowledge of such bases might prompt more Chinese observers to resent North Korean attempts at strategic entanglement,” he added.
    


            Construction on the base began in 2004, according to satellite images, and it has been operational since 2014, the report found. Since then, the base has been “well-maintained” and continues to be actively developed – potentially reflecting ongoing advancements in North Korea's missile testing, it said.
    


            It's not yet clear what model of ballistic missile is stored at the base – but CSIS researchers believe it's equipped with North Korea's nuclear-capable Hwasong-15 or Hwasong-18 ICBMS, or a different type of ICBM that has not yet been revealed.
    


            The report also said the base carries transporter launchers or mobile launchers – which can quickly shoot and move to a new position.
    


            “During times of crisis or war, these launchers and missiles will exit the base, meet special warhead storage/transportation units, and conduct launch operations from dispersed pre-surveyed sites,” the report said.
    


            The report also included satellite imagery that pointed out the base's many facilities, including entrance checkpoints, headquarter buildings, warehouses, missile support facilities and small housing buildings.
    


North Korea's Kim Jong Un threatens to destroy the South with nuclear weapons if provoked



            Some of these have been deliberately covered with trees and bushes to conceal their entrances – making them difficult to locate in satellite images except for winter “when vegetation is sparse,” the report said.
    


            The secret base is part of North Korea's “missile belt” of several other bases – some of which CSIS has published separate reports about – which make up the main components of Pyongyang's “evolving ballistic missile strategy, and its expanding strategic-level nuclear deterrence and strike capabilities,” the report said.
    


            North Korea is believed to possess between 40 and 50 nuclear warheads, along with the means to deliver them across the region and potentially to the US mainland. Kim has also ramped up his rhetoric in recent years, vowing to build up the country's nuclear program and threatening to use it to destroy South Korea if attacked.

            Democrats have tried everything to beat Donald Trump.
    


            But they're only 1 for 3 in presidential elections against him.
    


            Twice, they impeached him — but that didn't destroy his political career.
    


            Several top Democratic prosecutors brought the force of the law against him, but in trying to bring him down, they only made him stronger.
    


            They've tried to “go high” when he went low. But he went lower and won.
    


            And painting Trump as the worst-ever threat to American democracy didn't thwart the greatest White House comeback story in history.
    


            So, what do Democrats do now?
    


            The latest plan, piloted by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose counteroffensive just won the support of former President Barack Obama, is to be a bit more like Trump — but only up to a point and for a limited time.
    


            California state legislators are expected on Thursday to pass bills to set up a statewide referendum in November on redrawing the state's congressional maps in a way that could net Democrats five seats in the House of Representatives.
    


            The counterattack went into force after deep-red Texas enacted its plan, ordered by the president, to launch a rare mid-cycle redistricting effort in search of five Republican House seats. Trump is blatantly attempting to save the GOP — and himself — from losing the chamber in the 2026 midterms and is prepared to do anything to prevent it.
    


            Texas Democrats made a big noise, leaving the state to block votes on the plan — but like almost all other party schemes to slow Trump, it was doomed to fail. The Texas House passed the redistricting bill  on Wednesday; it will now move to the state Senate.
    


            Newsom — who has a long and testy history with the president — but who shares some of his instincts for stunt politics — is not just taking on Trump by leveraging the mechanics of government in the Democratic cause.
    


            He's also personifying the maxim that one way to defang a bully is to laugh at him. The governor's turned his social media accounts into a parody of the president's own huffing and puffing in block capitals on Truth Social.
    


            “THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER! — GN” Newsom wrote after a post on X earlier this month, trolling Trump by mimicking one of his online quirks.
    


            This might all seem rather immature and below the dignity of the governor of one of the most powerful states in the union. But it's playing Trump at his own social media game and recognizes that the president has shattered the norms of political speech.
    


            A more serious argument many Democrats are now making is that the Republican Party has transformed into such an anti-democratic force that they must do everything to fight back.
    


            Sure, it would be more noble for Democrats to stand on principle and refuse to follow Republicans down an authoritarian path by just drawing up more House seats because they feel like it. But they'd be sure to lose.
    


            Newsom's response might be cynical. But he's also seized on the Texas redistricting fight because he's one of the few Democrats who have power and know how to use it. He's also channeling palpable demands from the Democratic base for more of a fight.
    


            “He doesn't play by a different set of rules,” Newsom said of Trump last week. “He doesn't believe in the rules.” On Monday, Newsom seized on Trump's latest Truth Social rant about mail-in voting with his own post on X that aimed to get into the president's head.
    


            “Trump knows he is going to LOSE in 2026,” Newsom wrote. “His plan to rig new Congressional seats is going to backfire — thanks to California. Now, he's clamoring for other ways to cook the results. This man reeks of DESPERATION.”
    


            Newsom is taking a political gamble. There is no guarantee that enough of California's voters will agree with his attempt to change the state Constitution. The California Citizens Redistricting Commission is a cherished plank of state democracy.
    


            But as he eyes the White House, the California governor has created a platform to elevate himself over Democratic rivals in galvanizing demands for more urgency in the fight against Trump and his administration challenging election fairness on multiple fronts.
    


            In effect, he's soft-launching a bid for the 2028 Democratic nomination without having to make it official. If he succeeds in creating more seats for his party and it captures the House next year, he will claim a lion's share of the credit.
    


            Obama addressed the conundrum of whether to play by the rules on redistricting as a true democrat might in a speech on Tuesday night.
    


            “I've had to wrestle with my preference, which would be that we don't have political gerrymandering,” he said at a fundraiser for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. The ex-president added: “What I also know is that if we don't respond effectively, then this White House and Republican-controlled state governments all across the country, they will not stop, because they do not appear to believe in this idea of an inclusive, expansive democracy.”
    


            Obama said he had “tremendous respect” for Newsom's approach in that Newsom made the California response conditional on what Texas did. He also praised Newsom's proposal to restore the state's independent redistricting committee after the 2030 census — following Trump's term.
    


            The 44th president's pragmatism reflects bitter experience, since he rocketed to attention in a 2004 Democratic National Convention address in which he declared, “There's not a liberal America and a conservative America — there's the United States of America.”
    


            Obama might be best remembered for soaring speeches. But eight years since he left the White House, it's often forgotten he could play hardball: His 2012 reelection campaign ruthlessly savaged GOP nominee Mitt Romney's character.
    


            Arguing that democracy was not “self-executing,” Obama said that if Democrats really believe their own rhetoric, they should do something about it. He called for more support for the NDRC, litigation and organizing.
    


            And Obama also made striking allusions to the fights against slavery and racial discrimination in the 20th century. “It took organizing and activism, and people demonstrating and sometimes getting beat or thrown in jail. It took a civil war,” he said. “It took extraordinary leadership and courage in order to amend the Constitution. And then to make sure that those victories were actually manifested required people to march and go to jail and in some cases, die.” This came against a backdrop of the supine response of law firms, universities and corporate chieftains to Trump's power grabs.
    


            Obama's warning posed the immediate question of whether the ex-president will be taking a more prominent political role himself. Obama has been a caustic critic of Trump at key moments — for instance during the 2020 and 2024 Democratic National Conventions, when he warned about his successor's threat to democracy. But he has wide interests in a lucrative retirement, including in film production and advocacy for his post-presidential foundation. And ex-presidents (among many others) know there can be a price for standing up to a successor who has weaponized the Justice Department.
    


            And would Obama be an effective force?
    


            His efforts in 2024, including a barn-burner speech at the convention in Chicago that was one-upped by former first lady Michelle Obama, couldn't prevent Trump's return to the White House. Many Democrats are pining for a new generation of leaders. And the next Democratic president, whenever he or she arrives, will require fresh vision and energy after the GOP's attempt to eviscerate the government.
    


            Meanwhile, Newsom isn't the only Democrat adopting some of Trump's methods to try to gain traction in the age of fragmented media and online anarchy. Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, for instance, has been trolling the president, Trump-style on social media. “The man in the White House wants to ‘crack down' on crime in D.C.… cute,” she wrote on X this week. “The audacity of sitting in the Oval Office with felony charges and thinking you can lecture anyone on ‘law and order.'”
    


            Still, Democrats had better be careful. However brazen they get, they'll never match Trump's flame-throwing. A subtext of Trump's populism is that all politics are corrupt. And if voters believe that the Democrats are just as bad as the president, his own more venal behavior won't seem as bad.
    


            Trump and MAGA Republicans are trying to create such equivalence. They've portrayed the criminal indictments against Trump during his campaign as the cold-blooded exploitation of government power — even though several of them arose from his attempt to steal the 2020 election. The GOP has better arguments that he was singled out in a successful civil fraud prosecution against him, his adult sons and the Trump Organization in New York.
    


            And when Republicans argue that Democrats are guilty of flagrant partisan redistricting of House seats in states they control, like Illinois and Maryland, they have a point. Still, most such efforts fit into the conventional corruption of the age-old practice of gerrymandering. No modern political figure has attempted the assaults on democracy and elections carried out by Trump.
    


            The run-up to the midterms may also show whether voters want another showdown over democracy when they are pained by still-high grocery prices and a struggle to afford housing. Neither party has compelling plans to offer relief. No wonder Trump's approval ratings are underwater and Democrats have been plumbing record lows in popularity this year.
    


            Democrats are now vowing to “fight fire with fire,” as New York Gov. Kathy Hochul put it recently.
    


            But getting down in the muck and fighting dirty with Trump is risky.
    


            He's miles better at it than they are.

            They roll down Beijing streets, some covered from prying eyes by huge tarpaulins, but the silhouettes of missiles, tanks and undersea vehicles are unmistakable as China prepares for its most revealing military parade in six years.
    


            For military watchers, the procession of veiled armaments is offering valuable clues to what might be on show at a massive military parade on September 3, which China says will reveal the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) “new generation” of domestically produced, active-duty weaponry. It will be the largest display of advancements in China's military hardware since the 2019 National Day parade.
    


            That parade celebrated 70 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China. This year's parade will celebrate the 80th anniversary of another landmark moment in Chinese history, the end of World War II following the surrender of Imperial Japan, whose invasion of China began in 1931.
    


            The 2019 parade saw the PLA unveil weapons including a road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile, a medium-range ballistic missile mated with a hypersonic glide vehicle, and its first undersea drone.
    


            Beijing has pursued a head-turning military buildup under Chinese leader Xi Jinping, during which the PLA – previously not even one of the strongest in Asia – has started to rival, or in some categories surpass, the US military in analysts' estimations.
    


            On September 3 military watchers are expecting new versions of some of the weaponry and technology that debuted in 2019.
    


            Parade rehearsals have shown what are almost certainly new types of hypersonic missile systems and huge undersea drones among other weaponry, masked by tarpaulins and fabric coverings.
    


            Officials on Wednesday ran down a categorical list of what the PLA will show off on September 3.
    


            “The parade involves more than 10,000 personnel, over a hundred aircraft, and several hundred ground vehicles,” Maj. Gen. Xu Guizhong, executive deputy director of the Parade Command Office of the PLA's Central Theater Command, told a briefing in Beijing.
    


            More than 100 different types of equipment will be included, all of it battle ready and domestically produced, Xu said, adding that a large proportion would be new armaments making their debut.
    


            The general ticked off a range of China's most modern weaponry that it's never shown the world before: cutting-edge drones, directed-energy weapons, electronic jamming systems, hypersonic systems, air-defense and missile-defense technologies, and strategic missiles.
    


            And there will be the normal formations of fighter jets, tanks and troops, Xu said.
    


            The plans seem to satisfy the wish list of one Chinese citizen CNN spoke to as speculation swirled in recent days.
    


            “I'd like to see whether there will be some drone displays, or how the different troops will present themselves in different orders. I'd also be interested in our military strength, such as tanks,” said Liu Hongmei, a tourist from Yunnan province who was visiting Beijing.
    


            Comments on the micro-blogging platform Weibo reflected strong enthusiasm for the upcoming parade, with many people asking for a national holiday so they could catch it on TV.
    


            “Can we get a day off to watch the live broadcast?” one poster asked, getting more than 2,000 likes.

            “I'm definitely taking a day off to watch on September 3, canceling all my plans,” another wrote.
    


            And it's something the public seems to want more of, according to some enthusiastic posts.
    


            “Only 70 minutes? That's not enough to watch!” one post said.
    


            And it looks like the PLA will keep stoking the excitement.
    


            The PLA has promised more details to come in the weeks before September 3, when it won't only be residents of China who are tuning in for an update on the country's military arsenal.
    


            “As for the specific models of the showcased equipment, please stay tuned; more information will be available soon,” Xu told Wednesday's press briefing.

NEW YORK (AP) — A New York appeals court on Thursday threw out the massive financial penalty a state judge imposed on President Donald Trump, while narrowly upholding a finding he engaged in fraud by exaggerating his wealth for decades. The ruling spares Trump from a potential half-billion-dollar fine but bans him and his two eldest sons from serving in corporate leadership for a few years.

Trump, in a social media post, claimed “total victory.”

“I greatly respect the fact that the Court had the Courage to throw out this unlawful and disgraceful Decision that was hurting Business all throughout New York State,” he wrote.

The decision came seven months after the Republican returned to the White House. A sharply divided panel of five judges in New York's mid-level Appellate Division couldn't agree on many issues raised in Trump's appeal, but a majority said the monetary penalty was “excessive.”

After finding Trump flagrantly padded financial statements that went to lenders and insurers, Judge Arthur Engoron ordered him last year to pay $355 million in penalties. With interest, the sum has topped $515 million. Additional penalties levied on some other Trump Organization executives, including Trump's sons Eric and Donald Jr. — bring the total to $527 million, with interest.

“While the injunctive relief ordered by the court is well crafted to curb defendants' business culture, the court's disgorgement order, which directs that defendants pay nearly half a billion dollars to the State of New York, is an excessive fine that violates the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution,” Judges Dianne T. Renwick and Peter H. Moulton wrote in one of three opinions shaping the appeals court's ruling.




Engoron's other punishments, upheld by the appeals court, have been on pause during Trump's appeal, and the president was able to hold off collection of the money by posting a $175 million bond.

The court, which split on the merits of the lawsuit and Engoron's fraud finding, dismissed the penalty in its entirety while also leaving a pathway for an appeal to the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals. Trump and his co-defendants, the judges wrote, can seek to extend the pause on any punishments taking effect.

The panel was sharply divided, issuing 323 pages of concurring and dissenting opinions with no majority. Rather, some judges endorsed parts of their colleagues' findings while denouncing others, enabling the court to rule.

Two judges wrote that they felt New York Attorney General Letitia James' lawsuit against Trump and his companies was justifiable and that she had proven her case but the penalty was too severe. One wrote that James exceeded her legal authority in bringing the suit, saying that if any of Trump's lenders felt cheated, they could have sued him themselves, and none did. One judge wrote that Engoron erred by ruling before the trial began that the attorney general had proved Trump engaged in fraud.

In his portion of the ruling, Judge David Friedman, who was appointed to the court by Republican Gov. George Pataki, was scathing in his criticism of James for bringing the lawsuit.

“Plainly, her ultimate goal was not ‘market hygiene' ... but political hygiene, ending with the derailment of President Trump's political career and the destruction of his real estate business,” Friedman wrote. “The voters have obviously rendered a verdict on his political career. This bench today unanimously derails the effort to destroy his business.”

In a statement, James focused on the part of the case that went her way, saying the court had “affirmed the well-supported finding of the trial court: Donald Trump, his company, and two of his children are liable for fraud.”

“It should not be lost to history: yet another court has ruled that the president violated the law, and that our case has merit,” James said.

The appeals court, the Appellate Division of the state's trial court, took an unusually long time to rule, weighing Trump's appeal for nearly 11 months after oral arguments last fall. Normally, appeals are decided in a matter of weeks or a few months.

Trump and his co-defendants denied wrongdoing. At the conclusion of the civil trial in January 2024, Trump said he was “an innocent man” and the case was a “fraud on me.” The Republican has repeatedly maintained the case and the verdict were political moves by James and Engoron, both Democrats. 

Trump's Justice Department has subpoenaed James for records related to the lawsuit, among other documents, as part of an investigation into whether she violated the president's civil rights. James' personal attorney Abbe D. Lowell has said investigating the fraud case is “the most blatant and desperate example of this administration carrying out the president's political retribution campaign.”

Trump and his lawyers said his financial statements weren't deceptive, since they came with disclaimers noting they weren't audited. The defense also noted bankers and insurers independently evaluated the numbers, and the loans were repaid.

Despite such discrepancies as tripling the size of his Trump Tower penthouse, he said the financial statements were, if anything, lowball estimates of his fortune.

During an appellate court hearing last September, Trump's lawyers argued that many of the case's allegations were too old and that James had misused a consumer protection law to sue Trump over private business transactions that were satisfactory to those involved. 

State attorneys said that while Trump insists no one was harmed by the financial statements, his exaggerations led lenders to make riskier loans and that honest borrowers lose out when others game their net worth numbers.

The civil fraud case was just one of several legal obstacles for Trump as he campaigned, won and segued to a second term as president.

On Jan. 10, he was sentenced in his criminal hush money case to what's known as an unconditional discharge, leaving his conviction on the books but sparing him jail, probation, a fine or other punishment. He is appealing the conviction.

And in December, a federal appeals court upheld a jury's finding that Trump sexually abused writer E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s and later defamed her, affirming a $5 million judgment against him. The appeals court declined in June to reconsider. Trump still can try to get the Supreme Court to hear his appeal. 

Trump also is appealing a subsequent verdict that requires him to pay Carroll $83.3 million for additional defamation claims.

The number of people in the United States illegally surged to an all-time high of 14 million in 2023, a research group said Thursday, a major increase that still falls well short of estimates from President Donald Trump and some critics of immigration.

The Pew Research Center's closely watched gauge rose from 11.8 million a year earlier and surpassed the previous high of 12.2 million in 2007. The increase was driven by some 6 million who were in the country with some form of legal protection. Trump has stripped many of those protections since taking office in January.




Pew, whose estimates date back to 1990, said that, while 2023 is its latest full analysis, preliminary findings show the number rose in 2024, though at a slower rate after then-President Joe Biden severely restricted asylum at the border in June of that year. The number dropped this year under Trump, but is still likely above 14 million.

The overall U.S. immigrant population, regardless of legal status, reached an all-time high of more than 53 million in January 2025, accounting for a record 15.8% of the U.S. population. The number has since dropped, which Pew said would be the first time it has shrunk since the 1960s.

While the findings are unlikely to settle debate, Pew's report is one of the most complete attempts to measure illegal immigration. Nearly all the increase came from countries other than Mexico. Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and India accounted for the largest numbers after Mexico. Totals from Venezuela, Cuba, Colombia, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Ukraine and Peru each more than doubled in two years.

Trump said in an address to Congress in March that 21 million people “poured into the United States” during the previous four years, far exceeding estimates from Pew and what figures on border arrests suggest. The Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group largely aligned with his policies, estimated 18.6 million in March.




The Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors immigration restrictions, reported that there were 14.2 million people in the U.S. illegally last month, down from a peak of 15.8 million in January. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem touted the reported drop of 1.6 million in six months. “This is massive,” she said in a press release last week.

Noem's own department, through its Office of Homeland Security Statistics, estimates there were 11 million people in the U.S. illegally in 2022, its most recent count. The Center for Migration Studies, author of another closely watched survey, most recently pegged the number at 12.2 million in 2022, topping its previous high of 12 million in 2008.

Pew's findings, based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau survey and Department of Homeland Security, reflect an increase in people crossing the border illegally to exercise rights to seek asylum and Biden-era policies to grant temporary legal status. Those policies included a border appointment system called CBP One and permits for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.

Trump has ended those policies and also sought to reverse Biden's expansion of Temporary Protected Status for people already in the United States whose countries are deemed unsafe to return to. 

Mexicans were the largest nationality among people in the country illegally, a number that grew slightly to 4.3 million in 2023. The increase came almost entirely from other countries, totaling 9.7 million, up from 6.4 million two years earlier.

States with the largest numbers of people in the country illegally were, in order, California, Texas, Florida, New York, New Jersey and Illinois, though Texas sharply narrowed its gap with California. Even with the increases in recent years, six states had smaller numbers in 2023 than in the previous peak in 2007: Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Oregon.

Pew estimated that a record 9.7 million people without legal status were in the workforce, or about 5.6% of the U.S. labor force in 2023, with Nevada, Florida, New Jersey and Texas having the largest shares.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched a rare drone and missile attack on western Ukraine overnight, officials said Thursday, striking targets including an American-owned electronics plant and injecting further uncertainty into the U.S.-led efforts to end the three-year-old war.

The aerial assault on a part of Ukraine that has largely avoided such focused attacks was one of Russia's biggest this year and came amid Moscow's objections to key aspects of proposals that could end the fighting following Russia's February 2022 invasion of its neighbor.

U.S. President Donald Trump discussed the war with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska last week before hosting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House on Monday.




Trump last month questioned Putin's commitment to ending the war, saying the Russian leader “talks nice and then he bombs everybody.”

In a social media post Thursday, Trump criticized his predecessor, Joe Biden, for not providing Ukraine with more weaponry it needs to “fight back.”

“It is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invaders country,” Trump said. “It's like a great team in sports that has a fantastic defense, but is not allowed to play offensive. There is no chance of winning! It is like that with Ukraine and Russia.”

The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Trump is weighing any changes to the types of weapons the U.S. will provide to Kyiv.




Russia has fired nearly 1,000 long-range drones and missiles at Ukraine since Monday's White House talks, according to Ukrainian tallies.

European countries are discussing how they can deploy military assets to deter any postwar Russian assault on Ukraine. But the Kremlin won't accept the deployment of any troops from NATO countries, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Wednesday that making security arrangements for Ukraine without Moscow's involvement was pointless.

Putin is ready to meet with Zelenskyy to discuss peace terms, Lavrov said Thursday, but only after key issues have been worked out by senior officials in what could be a protracted negotiating process because the two sides remain far apart.

Ukrainian and European leaders have accused Putin of stalling in the peace efforts in the hopes that his bigger army, which has been making slow advances, can capture more Ukrainian land.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio planned to host a conference call Thursday with the national security advisers of European countries expected to play a role in future security guarantees for Ukraine, a senior U.S. official said. It wasn't immediately clear which countries would be on the call. The U.S. official spoke on condition of anonymity to outline a discussion that had not been publicly announced.

Military leaders from Ukraine, the U.S., the U.K., Finland, France, Germany and Italy met Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington to work out military options, said Joseph Holstead, a spokesperson for the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. His statement gave no details about what specifically was discussed at the meeting, which also included NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe.

But an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly about the discussions said, “Everything is being considered and nothing is being ruled out,” regarding security guarantees for Ukraine, apart from U.S. boots on the ground.

Military chiefs and their staffs are looking at a variety of options including “how big” the security guarantee is and what happens if it is implemented with or without a ceasefire, the official said, noting that European defense chiefs acknowledged its their “responsibility to secure Europe.”

Russia launched 574 drones and 40 ballistic and cruise missiles overnight, the Ukrainian Air Force said. The attack mostly targeted western regions of the country where much of the military aid provided by Ukraine's Western allies is believed to be delivered and stored. The strikes killed at least one person and injured 15 others, according to officials. 

Zelenskyy condemned the attack amid the push for peace, saying it was carried out “as if nothing were changing at all.”

A U.S. electronics plant near the Hungarian border was struck, according to Andy Hunder, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine. The Flex factory is one of the biggest American investments in Ukraine, Hunder told The Associated Press.

At the moment of impact, 600 night shift workers were on the premises, and six were injured, Hunder said. Russian attacks on Ukraine since it launched its invasion have damaged property belonging to more than half of the chamber's roughly 600 members, he added

“The message is clear: Russia is not looking for peace. Russia is attacking American business in Ukraine, humiliating American business,” Hunder said.

Russia's Defense Ministry said the strikes targeted “enterprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex.” It claimed the attack hit drone factories, storage depots and missile launch sites, as well as areas where Ukrainian troops were gathered. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilian areas of Ukraine.

In the western city of Lviv, one person was killed and three were injured as the attack damaged 26 residential buildings, a kindergarten and administrative buildings, regional head Maksym Kozytskyi wrote on Telegram. The regional prosecutor's office said three Russian cruise missiles with cluster munitions struck the city.




Moscow has shown no signs of pursuing meaningful negotiations to end the war, Zelenskyy said. He urged the international community to respond with stronger pressure on Moscow, including tougher sanctions and tariffs.

In comments Wednesday that were embargoed until Thursday, Zelenskyy said plans for security guarantees will become clearer by the end of next week. He said he then expects to be ready to hold direct talks with Putin for the first time since the full-scale invasion.

The talks could also be conducted in a trilateral format alongside Trump, Zelenskyy said.

A venue for the meeting is being discussed, and Switzerland, Austria and Turkey are possibilities, Zelenskyy added.

Ukraine, meanwhile, has kept up its attacks with domestically produced long-range drones on infrastructure inside Russia that supports Moscow's war effort. Among other targets, it has hit oil refineries, and Russian wholesale gasoline prices have reached record highs in recent days.

IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — Recalling the damage her now-arrested coach inflicted on her and many of her gymnast friends, Finley Weldon said she feels a sense of pride.

Free from the grip that Sean Gardner had during her years of training at an Iowa academy known for producing Olympians, Weldon told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview that she is among the few who survived his abuse and are still in the sport.

The 18-year-old is heading into her freshman year at Iowa State University, where she'll be a member of the Cyclones gymnastics team. She spoke with the AP on Wednesday, less than a week after Gardner was arrested on a child sexual exploitation charge.

“I didn't want him to take away anything from me, especially something that I love,” she said. “None of the girls that I started with or went through the things that I did with Sean are still doing gymnastics today. So that's something I'm very proud of.”

She's also happy she's made a difference, in the same way gymnasts she admires — such as Aly Raisman, an Olympian whose visceral accounts of abuse by Larry Nassar shined a spotlight on the trauma gymnasts went through and how authorities failed to curb it.

The AP generally does not identify victims of sexual abuse, but Weldon said she wanted “my name out there because I was the one who did come forward.”

“I felt like I needed to speak out to stop it from happening to other little girls, so they didn't have to go through what I went through,” Weldon said. 

“I knew it would just be a continuous cycle if nobody did.”





The FBI said Tuesday it believes Gardner “targeted children” while coaching at Chow's Gymnastics and Dance Institute in West Des Moines, and gyms in Mississippi and Louisiana where he worked dating back to 2004.

Gardner, 38, didn't return AP messages left on his cellphone before his arrest, and has not entered a plea to the charge. A public defender who represented him after his arrest hasn't returned messages.

Another former gymnast at Chow's, the academy known for producing Olympic gold medalists Shawn Johnson and Gabby Douglas, first reported sexual abuse allegations against Gardner to the U.S. Center for SafeSport in March 2022, alleging he fondled her during training sessions, according to an FBI affidavit.

That girl provided the names of six other of Gardner's potential victims, according to the affidavit. Weldon said she spoke with a SafeSport investigator about her abuse at the time.

SafeSport, a watchdog created after the Nassar scandal to investigate misconduct complaints, informed the West Des Moines Police Department about the allegations. It suspended Gardner from coaching or having contact with any gymnasts in July 2022.

In its first statement on the case, Chow's Gymnastics said Thursday that it fired Gardner in response to the suspension, even though the facility wasn't told the details of the allegations and SafeSport hadn't issued an official finding of misconduct. 

The police department said its investigation was closed in 2022 when the initial accuser decided she did not want to pursue charges.

Weldon said police never reached out to her in 2022 but she's unsure whether she would have wanted to press charges then. She said she came forward in April 2024 at age 16 after she matured and began to realize the severity of her abuse. 

She praised police for doing “an amazing job” keeping her informed about the progress of the case.

“It's definitely taken awhile, but I mean, even I didn't realize how many steps there would be to charge him with anything,” she said.



Iowa investigators say they searched Gardner's home in May and seized electronic devices that contained images of nude girls from a hidden camera Gardner placed in the bathroom of a Purvis, Mississippi, gym where he previously worked.

West Des Moines Police Sgt. Daniel Wade said Wednesday the department sought the FBI's assistance in mid-July when the case's “scope started to broaden.” Asked why the department didn't involve FBI sooner, he said, “We call the FBI when the time is right.”

Gardner is charged in federal court in Mississippi with producing visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct related to the alleged hidden camera. Federal and state investigations remain active, and additional charges are possible.

Wade defended the department's investigative efforts over the last three years. He said investigators “went as far with it as we could” in 2022, without a victim seeking charges and have been conducting a thorough investigation since receiving the new complaint in 2024.

Wade declined comment on whether investigators reached out to Weldon and other potential victims identified in 2022, saying only that police opened “lines of communication with different people” that later paid off.

Weldon said she met with investigators Tuesday and they asked her to identify herself in an image Gardner allegedly secretly took of her in a vulnerable stretching position.



Weldon said her goal since she was a girl was to reach the elite level in the USA Gymnastics Junior Olympic program for those who aim to compete internationally.

She said she started training at Chow's after her family moved to Iowa in 2015. She began taking private lessons with Gardner two or three times per week shortly after he joined Chow's in September 2018, when she 11 years old.

Weldon said she was struggling as her parents went through a divorce and her father was largely absent from her life. She said Gardner sought to fill that role by telling her she could tell him “anything” and that he would always be there for her.

In hindsight, she said he was manipulating her in order to gain her trust.

Finley's mother, Julie Weldon, said she heard concerns about Gardner from other parents at Chow's early on and asked her daughter whether her coach had ever done anything inappropriate. Finley said she falsely told her mother no because she was protecting the “male figure in my life.”

She said Gardner began touching her inappropriately in 2019 during lessons, beginning with long hugs and pats on the back. She said his behavior progressed, and he began touching her butt during the hugs and requiring her to stretch for extended periods in positions that exposed her vagina and anus out of her leotard.

She said around 2020 he began touching her vagina while spotting her during exercises. She recalled once telling him not to put his hands there and he claimed it was an accident because her “leotard was slippery.”

Weldon recalled reaching her breaking point with Gardner after a 2021 training in which he yelled and threw shoes at her, telling her she'd never reach elite status. She said she walked out and told her mom she wanted to quit.

She said many of her classmates quit or didn't return because of Gardner's conduct after the gym shut down during the pandemic. But while he made her hate gymnastics at times, she continued training when her family moved to Texas and then to Utah. She said she eventually proved Gardner wrong by earning elite status and a spot on a Division 1 team.

After news of Gardner's arrest, Weldon saw his jail booking photo in the AP story. She said she was struck by how much heavier and unkempt he appeared.

“He's definitely like gone through a spiral,” she said. “I think he probably just had so much guilt built up in him that he kind of turned into that.”

Fox News contributor Dan Hoffman joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss Zelenskyy's discussion with President Donald Trump over Russia's peace offer and what it could mean for relations with China.

In one of the largest overnight strikes since the war began, Russia unleashed some 614 drones, ballistic and cruise missiles across Ukraine, killing one, injuring dozens and destroying an American-owned electronics company less than an hour from two NATO borders, officials confirmed Thursday morning. 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksyy said the strike on the private U.S. company, which involved ""several"" cruise missiles, was ""very telling"" following President Donald Trump's attempts to force Moscow to end its invasion.

RUSSIA'S LAVROV LOOKS TO DRAW CHINA IN ON UKRAINE'S ‘SECURITY GUARANTEES'

""Last night, the Russian army set one of its insane anti-records,"" Zelenskyy said. ""They targeted civilian infrastructure facilities, residential buildings, and our people. 

""Several cruise missiles were lobbed against an American-owned enterprise in Zakarpattia,"" he continued, describing the company as ""a regular civilian business, supported by American investment, producing everyday items like coffee machines."" 

""And yet, it was also a target for the Russians. This is very telling,"" Zelenskyy added.

The American business is believed to be Flex Ltd., whose corporate headquarters is in Austin, Texas, but which has business locations across the globe.

Some 15 people were apparently injured in the strike on the city of Mukachevo in the Zakarpattia region – which sits just 30 miles from two NATO nations, Hungary and Slovakia.

UKRAINE'S STOLEN CHILDREN CRISIS LOOMS LARGE AS NATO MEETS ON RUSSIA'S WAR

Flex Ltd. did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's questions.

The overnight strike included 574 drones and 40 missiles, and hit numerous locations across Ukraine. 

The White House also did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's questions regarding the president's reaction to the strike that targeted a U.S. company, though on Tuesday he said, ""It's possible that [Putin] doesn't want to make a deal.""

""We're going to find out about President Putin in the next couple of weeks,"" he added. 

NATO leaders have repeatedly questioned Putin's willingness to engage in good-faith negotiations as well as his desire to end his war ambitions – questions that gained little clarity even after Trump's in-person meeting with the Kremlin chief in Alaska on Friday.

France – which has become a leading player backing Ukraine – on Thursday reiterated this point, and in a statement to Fox News Digital, said despite Russian claims that they are ""ready to negotiate,"" the overnight strikes suggest otherwise. 

""These attacks, the most massive in a month, illustrate Russia's lack of any genuine intention to engage seriously in peace talks,"" a spokesperson with the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs told Fox News Digital. 

""France reiterates its support for President Trump's initiative in favor of a just and lasting peace and will continue to work with determination alongside Ukraine and its partners,"" the spokesperson added.

California state Democrats are pushing new redistricting efforts as a new Trump-backed congressional map makes its way through the Texas legislature.


California Democrats, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, are gearing up to nullify Texas' new congressional map with their own.

Lawmakers in the Golden State are expected to pass a trio of bills that would allow voters to decide whether to overturn the preexisting congressional maps and the state's independent redistricting commission, and usher in a new one with a more partisan bent.

Indeed, Newsom's push for a special session and new map is a call and response to President Donald Trump, Gov. Greg Abbott and Texas Republicans, who crafted their own fresh map that passed the Texas House on Wednesday that gives the GOP five new, Republican-leaning districts.

ABBOTT SCORES BIG WIN IN REDISTRICTING BATTLE AS TEXAS DEMOCRATS' BLOCKADE COLLAPSES

California's proposal would turn five Republican districts into Democratic-leaning districts in an effort to cancel out the changes made in Texas. Both states are engaging in a broader battle to gain control of the House pushed by Trump, who wants to buck the pendulum swing trend during off-cycle elections and maintain control of the lower chamber.

""This is about taking back our country,"" Newsom told reporters on a press call Wednesday. ""This is about the Democratic Party now punching back forcefully and very intentionally.""

Thursday's legislative session comes on the heels of the California GOP's attempt to halt the process by charging that they did not have their constitutionally granted 30 days to review the legislation, which was shot down by the California Supreme Court on Wednesday.

During Thursday's session, California lawmakers will consider three bills, one to pay for the special session, one containing the new map and another teeing up a constitutional amendment to be considered by voters in November.

The proposed map would likely affect five California Republicans' districts, including Reps. Doug LaMalfa, David Valadao, Darrell Issa, Ken Calvert and Kevin Kiley. Earlier this month, Kiley introduced legislation to halt the nationwide redistricting push until after the 2030 census.

Like the Texas map, it's not guaranteed that Democrats will win the seats, but Newsom and his supermajority in the state legislature are angling to give them a better shot.

TRUMP, ABBOTT VS. NEWSOM: MAD DASH TO REDO CONGRESSIONAL MAPS IN CALIFORNIA, TEXAS

But Trump's desire to maintain the GOP's trifecta in Washington has spurred other states to consider a redistricting effort, too.

""Big WIN for the Great State of Texas!!! Everything Passed, on our way to FIVE more Congressional seats and saving your Rights, your Freedoms, and your Country, itself,"" he said on his social media platform, Truth Social. ""Texas never lets us down. Florida, Indiana, and others are looking to do the same thing.""   

While Trump and his allies continue to prod for more changes to state maps, Newsom has found an ally in his own push: former President Barack Obama.

He argued that Newsom was taking a ""responsible approach,"" but noted that mid-decade redistricting, particularly of the hyperpartisan nature that Newsom and Republicans were engaged in, was not his preference.

""I've had to wrestle with my preference, which would be that we don't have political gerrymandering,"" Obama said on Tuesday at an event in Martha's Vineyard. ""But what I also know is that if we don't respond effectively, then this White House and Republican-controlled state governments all across the country, they will not stop.""

The USS New Orleans warship caught fire Wednesday off the coast of Okinawa, Japan, leaving two sailors with minor injuries, officials said.

The USS New Orleans warship caught fire Wednesday off the coast of Okinawa, Japan, leaving two sailors with minor injuries, officials said.

The fire aboard the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock burned for about 12 hours in the water at White Beach Naval Facility in Okinawa before the blaze was declared extinguished early Thursday morning, the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet said in a statement.

The fire on the 684-foot-long vessel is under investigation. 

Two sailors were treated for minor injuries, but no details about the injuries were immediately provided.

A Navy report concluded in that case that there were sweeping failures by commanders, crew members and others involved. The ship was left with extensive structural, electrical and mechanical damage and was later scrapped.

Vice President JD Vance greeted National Guard and police at Union Station in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday as protesters could be heard shouting in the background.

Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) confirmed to Fox News Digital on Thursday that there has not been a homicide in the city in more than a week.

""[T]here have been no recorded homicides in the city for the past week,"" said public information officer Michael Russo via email. ""Our last recorded homicide was August 13th.""

The homicide-free week comes after President Donald Trump's federalization of the D.C. police on Aug. 11, as federal law enforcement arrests skyrocket.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said on X Thursday morning that federal law enforcement made 53 arrests in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, and 24 more arrests were made by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

""Our mission to make DC safe again isn't slowing down,"" she said. 

On Wednesday, federal law enforcement also seized 10 guns, and the U.S. Marshals Service helped recover a missing child, according to Bondi. 

Since Trump federalized the D.C. police on Aug. 11 and called in National Guard troops to clean up the capital's streets – a controversial move that has caused fury among many of his political opponents – 630 people have been arrested in total, and 86 illegal guns have been confiscated. 

Wednesday's 77 total arrests are a slight jump from Tuesday.

Bondi announced Wednesday that federal law enforcement had made 66 arrests the prior day, and that eight illegal weapons had been seized.

FBI Director Kash Patel provided further updates on X on Thursday morning. 

""FBI joined federal partners in 31 more arrests last night,"" Patel said.

Those arrests included six illegal firearm recoveries, seven drug seizures, and charges including theft, assault with deadly weapon, drug offenses, assault on an officer and unlawful entry. 

""This is a team effort across multiple federal partners — they're working around the clock to get it done and your capital city is safer every day because of it,"" Patel said. 

Proponents of Trump's latest move include the National Fraternal Order of Police Vice President Joe Gamaldi, who noted that local officers have been handcuffed by the city's leadership.

""Their average homicide rate has doubled in the last 10 years. They used to average less than 100 homicides. Now they average over 200,"" Gamaldi said, a claim which is backed up by the city's own data. 

""And it's because you have a radical element on that city council that has defunded their police. They have embraced revolving door criminal justice policies. And frankly, they treated the hardworking men and women of law enforcement in that town like crap. So, of course, they need help. You have to do something, otherwise it's going to get out of control.""

Recent high-profile crimes leading up to the federalization include the brutal Aug. 3 beating and attempted carjacking of Edward Coristine, a former DOGE employee known as ""Big Balls.""

Former U.S. attorney Andy McCarthy weighs in after a New York appeals court threw out President Donald Trumps massive civil fraud penalty, with one judge calling it an excessive fine and claiming it violates the Eighth Amendment.

An appellate court has thrown out the $500 million civil fraud penalty against President Donald Trump in the high-profile case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James.

The New York Appellate Division overturned the penalty, ruling the disgorgement was an excessive fine that violates the Eighth Amendment.

The five-member panel all upheld findings that Trump and his company were liable, affirming that James acted within her authority and that injunctive relief to curb Trump Organization practices was appropriate.

The ruling leaves liability intact but eliminates the massive financial penalty of $364 million plus interest, which rises to around $500 million.

Trump took to Truth Social to declare a ""total victory"" and rail against James and the original trial judge, Arthur Engoron.

""TOTAL VICTORY in the FAKE New York State Attorney General Letitia James Case!"" Trump wrote. 

""I greatly respect the fact that the Court had the Courage to throw out this unlawful and disgraceful Decision that was hurting Business all throughout New York State. Others were afraid to do business there. The amount, including Interest and Penalties, was over $550 Million Dollars. It was a Political Witch Hunt, in a business sense, the likes of which no one has ever seen before.""

He also blasted the case as election interference, saying it was tried during his 2024 presidential campaign, while praising Justice David Friedman, who issued a partial dissent.

Friedman wrote that James' true aim was political and argued the entire case should be dismissed. He said her ""ultimate goal was not market hygiene … but political hygiene, ending with the derailment of President Trump's political career and the destruction of his real estate business.""

NY AG'S OFFICE HIRES ATTORNEY THAT REPPED HUNTER BIDEN TO DEFEND LETITIA JAMES AGAINST FRAUD ACCUSATIONS

Friedman blasted James' use of Section 63(12) of New York's Executive Law, which gives the state attorney general broad power to pursue civil fraud claims.

He wrote that it was unprecedented and political, giving James ""essentially limitless power to prosecute her political enemies."" 

Friedman wrote that Trump's business deals involved sophisticated parties who profited without harming the public and concluded he would ""reverse the judgment and dismiss the complaint.""

""Section 63(12) has never been used in the way it is being used in this case – namely, to attack successful, private, commercial transactions, negotiated at arm's length between highly sophisticated parties fully capable of monitoring and defending their own interests,"" Friedman wrote.

""All parties to these private transactions profited handsomely from the deals, from which there was no… discernible negative effect on the public interest.""

Because the judges were split on liability, the case is now likely headed to New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals.

James, a Democrat elected attorney general in 2018, has long had Trump in her crosshairs. During her campaign she called him an ""illegitimate president"" and pledged to ""use every area of the law"" to investigate him and his businesses.

Since Trump returned to office, the Justice Department has opened a grand jury investigation into James and issued subpoenas tied to the civil fraud case against Trump, Fox News Digital has learned.

James has alleged that Trump is using the federal government to go after her politically. The Justice Department is also investigating her for alleged mortgage fraud, including misrepresenting her primary residence on loans for homes in Virginia and New York. She denies the allegations and claims Trump is behind the move, calling it a ""revenge tour"" for the civil fraud lawsuit.

FOX Business' Jeff Flock reports on Cracker Barrel unveiling a new logo as part of a broader brand update.

Cracker Barrel's new logo was accused by conservative critics of being the company's ""Bud Light"" moment after receiving intense online backlash, while CEO Julie Felss Masino contended the response has been ""overwhelmingly positive."" 

The company unveiled the new logo on Tuesday as part of its new branding campaign for the Cracker Barrel Old Country Store restaurants. The campaign eliminated the iconic image of a man resting on a barrel in favor of a text-only logo for the first time since 1977. 

According to a company press release, this new logo is still ""anchored in Cracker Barrel's signature gold and brown tones"" and ""now rooted even more closely to the iconic barrel shape and word mark that started it all.""

""People like what we're doing,"" Masino told ""Good Morning America"" on Tuesday. ""Cracker Barrel needs to feel like the Cracker Barrel for today and for tomorrow – the things that you love are still there. We need people to choose us, and we want people to choose us.""

CRACKER BARREL FAN'S VIRAL TIKTOK SPARKS BACKLASH OVER RESTAURANT MAKEOVER

However, many social media users disagreed, particularly on the right, claiming the new logo was ""dull"" and destroyed the point of the brand.

""They took away the cracker and the barrel. What even is the point now?"" radio host Jesse Kelly asked.

""When will they learn?"" conservative influencer Benny Johnson asked, calling the change ""absolutely horrible.""

RedState writer Bonchie declared, ""This is how you destroy a brand."" 

""WTF is wrong with @CrackerBarrel??!"" Donald Trump Jr. exclaimed.

Conservative writer Rod Dreher wrote, ""The New Coke of corporate logos. Dull and unasked-for.""

Country music singer John Rich asked his followers, ""Will you go to Cracker Barrel now that it's going woke? This could be a ‘Bud Light' moment in the making...""

""All I want is to sit down next to a roaring fire after church in a cozy country diner run by patriots and have a hot stack of diabetes served by an old woman named Maude who calls me ‘hon' or ‘darlin' and still smokes two packs a day. Is that too much to ask? Apparently it's too much to ask,"" The Federalist co-founder Sean Davis wrote.

National Review reporter James Lynch wrote, ""There's a new trend where corporate marketing departments with nothing to do ruin classic company logos for no reason.""

CRACKER BARREL UNVEILS NEW MENU ITEMS FOR 2025: 'ORIGINAL AND BOLD'

Fox News Digital reached out to Cracker Barrel for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

Cracker Barrel had already come under fire earlier this month after videos of the restaurant chain's new look went viral. Critics similarly accused the redesign of being ""bland and boring.""

Cracker Barrel chief marketing officer Sarah Moore previously told Fox News Digital that the chain's ongoing transformation incorporated not only customer feedback but also employee input.

She claimed Cracker Barrel is ""listening to what the guests ask for – and examples of what the guests asked for are things like spaces that feel brighter, that feel less cluttered, more booth seating, more seating options, so our guests are more comfortable while they're dining with us.""

""It really is about taking that feedback and testing into various levels of remodels that, again, represent exactly who we are but create a brighter, lighter, fresher experience,"" she said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Vance told Zelensky he wouldn't say anything ‘as long as you behave' after earlier dust-up","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/foreign-policy/3763585/vance-zelensky-trump-meeting-behave-argument/","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 00:57:11 GMT","

Vice President J.D. Vance revealed on Wednesday a moment he attempted to “break the ice” with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ahead of his high-profile encounter with President Donald Trump.

The two world leaders met in the Oval Office earlier this week to discuss ending the Ukraine-Russia war, months after a previous meeting in Washington, D.C., derailed into an explosive argument between Trump, Zelensky, and Vance that was captured for the world on television cameras. 

Vance said this week that as he waited with Zelensky to meet with Trump again in the Oval Office, he cracked a joke about the viral quarrel that garnered some laughs from the Ukrainian president. 

“So President Zelensky walked into the Oval Office,” Vance said during an interview with Fox News's Laura Ingraham on The Ingraham Angle. “I was chatting with him, with the president, with some of the senior Ukrainian delegation. I said, ‘Mr. President, so long as you behave, I won't say anything.' And he just chuckled a little bit. It was a good little icebreaker.”

Vance: Zelenskyy walked into the oval office. I was chatting with him… I said Mr. President, so long as you behave, I won't say anything. It was a good little icebreaker pic.twitter.com/4uuylpjc8m

In further comments detailing the behind-the-scenes of the high-profile meeting, which ended cordially this time around, Vance argued that the personal encounter between Trump and Zelensky, which followed a similar summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska last week, was necessary if the countries wish to see an end to the Ukraine war. The vice president said the meetings helped distinguish “two big questions” about negotiations.

“Number one is, Ukraine wants to know that it's not going to get invaded again by Russia — wants to know that it's got territorial integrity long into the future,” he said. “[And] the Russians want certain pieces of territory, most of which they've occupied, but some of which they haven't. 

“So that is really where the meat of the negotiation is,” Vance continued. “The Ukrainians want security guarantees. The Russians want a certain amount of territory. Again, we finally got the details. We're working on them, but we haven't figured everything out, and I don't think that we should force — we shouldn't say that they can't sit down until you've figured out every little detail. Sometimes them sitting down is what facilitates figuring out those details.”

The vice president also reflected on Trump's federal takeover of Washington, D.C., which the White House has characterized as an effort to crack down on crime in the country's capital. Violent crime in Washington has dropped 35% due to federal intervention, while robberies have dropped 55%, Vance claimed. 

WHITE HOUSE PRESSING TOWARD PUTIN-ZELENSKY BILATERAL DESPITE KREMLIN'S SILENCE

“I hope the American people just recognize that you don't have to live with lawlessness,” he said. “You don't have to live with third-world murder rates. If you just take control of these cities, you can make them safe places to live again.”

“If you've got the political will to enforce the law, you can make even cities like D.C. safe again,” Vance concluded. “And that's what we're demonstrating.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The White House is pressing Senate Republicans to confirm an ally of President Donald Trump to the Federal Reserve board in time for its next meeting in mid-September, when members will decide whether to slash interest rates for the first time this year.

The GOP-led Senate doesn't return from the August recess until Sept. 2, giving a short timeline for Republicans to usher Stephen Miran, currently Trump's chief economist, through two votes — one in the Banking Committee and another on the Senate floor. But the administration has been arranging a quick series of meetings with GOP senators to expedite the confirmation process.

The next Fed meeting will take place on Sept. 16-17, and a White House official confirmed that Trump wants Miran in place by that date. The push to fast-track his appointment comes as Trump ramps up his scrutiny of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell over his reluctance to lower interest rates.

Miran, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, has had rolling meetings with GOP members of the Banking Committee, the panel that will be tasked with advancing his nomination to the full chamber. Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN) on Wednesday was the latest lawmaker to speak with Miran, and before that, he met with Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) and Sen. Jim Banks (R-IN).

Meetings with additional committee members are planned in the coming days, according to a White House official who said the administration “has been working aggressively” to move Miran's confirmation forward.

“Following a series of productive meetings with senators on the Banking Committee, there's clear excitement and momentum behind his nomination to the Federal Reserve Board,” the official said. “With the president's strong backing, we look forward to advancing his confirmation process in September.”

Even with committee support, senators will have just two weeks to get Miran confirmed by the entire chamber by the next Fed meeting, when the board will determine whether — and how much — to make its first cut of the year. Economists are generally predicting the Fed will slash its rates.

A senior Senate GOP aide said Republicans will prioritize nominees at the White House's direction and noted that Republicans are considering rules changes to expedite the process for all nominees following Democratic roadblocks this summer that have held up dozens of Trump nominees.

Banking panel Republicans, in addition to administration officials, are envisioning a prioritized approval process, raising the potential for an abnormally quick confirmation. 

Hagerty told the Washington Examiner in a statement that Miran should receive “swift confirmation.” Banks, who huddled with Miran Tuesday at the White House, has said Senate Republicans need to confirm him “ASAP before the Fed's September meeting.” Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH), speaking to reporters earlier this month, also envisioned a September timeline while conveying constituent frustration over elevated interest rates.

“Every single stop, question one, two, or three was about why we haven't lowered interest rates, which was very validating,” Moreno told the Washington Examiner of his interactions back in Ohio. “Hopefully, that happens in September.”

The Fed is expected to cut rates by 0.25% at next month's meeting after recent major downward revisions in job reports showed a worse-than-expected labor market. But inflation concerns persist, particularly as Trump leans further into his tariff agenda.

If confirmed, Miran would fill the seat of Adriana Kugler, who resigned earlier this month. The term would run until Kugler's term is set to expire Jan. 31, 2026.

TRUMP PICKS ADVISER STEPHEN MIRAN FOR OPEN FED BOARD SLOT

Powell's term as Fed Reserve chairman expires in May 2026, but his time on the board itself runs through January 2028. He's repeatedly rebuffed demands by Trump to support rate cuts.

Although Democrats have accused Miran of being a Trump loyalist, he expressed support for the independent nature of the Fed earlier this month by saying it's “of paramount importance.” ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A longtime ally and adviser to New York City Mayor Eric Adams was suspended after she attempted to give a reporter a bag of potato chips stuffed with cash.

Adams campaign adviser Winnie Greco gave a Herr's Sour Cream & Onion ripple potato chip filled with cash to a reporter from local news outlet the City. 

The reporter, Katie Honan, said she initially refused to take the bag of chips, but Greco had insisted. Honan told the New York Times that Greco had asked her at a campaign rally to meet across the street, where she was then handed the bag.

“I initially hoped it was a note, a tip, and then I looked and I go, ‘Oh my God, it's money,'” she said.

Inside the bag, Honan said she found at least one $100 bill and several $20 bills. She then contacted Greco again and told her she wanted to return the cash.

“I can't take this, when can I give it back to you,” Honan texted Greco, to which she received no response, according to the City. 

In a later interview with the outlet, Greco began to profusely apologize. 

“I make a mistake,” she said. “I'm so sorry. It's a culture thing. I don't know. I don't understand. I'm so sorry. I feel so bad right now. I'm so sorry, honey.”

She then referred the news outlet to her attorney.

“I can see how this looks strange,” Greco's attorney, Steven Brill, told the City. “But I assure you that Winnie's intent was purely innocent. In the Chinese culture, money is often given to others in a gesture of friendship and gratitude. Winnie is apologetic and embarrassed by any negative impression or confusion this may have caused.”

Adams's campaign later confirmed that Greco was no longer working with the campaign.

“Grecco [sic] holds no position in this campaign and has been suspended from all VOLUNTEER campaign-related activities,” Todd Shapiro, a spokesperson for Adams's reelection campaign, said in a statement, adding that the team was “shocked” by the gift.

Greco has been a close adviser to the mayor for over a decade, first starting to volunteer for him after he was Brooklyn borough president in 2013. She resigned as city's director of Asian Affairs last year after being caught up in the federal law enforcement investigation into Adams. The FBI raided two of her homes in connection with their investigation into a straw donations scheme in Adams's 2021 mayoral campaign.

Adams is running for reelection as an independent.

Richard Kim, the editor-in-chief of the City, called Greco's cash gift “deeply disturbing.”

HERE'S WHO TO WATCH IN NEW YORK CITY'S MAYORAL RACE THIS YEAR

“The fact that one of mayor Adams' closest, longtime advisors would attempt to ingratiate herself to any reporter, much less Katie Honan, with a cash gift is deeply disturbing and speaks to a rampant and blatant disregard for the role of a free and fair press,” Kim said.

“The choice of sour cream and onion chips is also questionable,” he added.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook on Wednesday defied President Donald Trump's calls for her to resign in light of accusations that she had committed mortgage fraud. 

Cook was appointed by former President Joe Biden to sit on the Fed, making her one of the 12 people who control the direction of interest rates, which Trump has pressured the central bank for months to lower to no avail. 

This week, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte revealed he had asked the Department of Justice to investigate Cook after his investigation concluded that it appeared she had committed mortgage fraud, leading Trump on Wednesday to call on the Fed governor to step down from her position in a post to Truth Social. 

Cook slapped down the president's demands the same day, saying she has “no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.” 

“I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve, and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts,” she added.

In a letter to the DOJ recommending Cook for criminal referral, Pulte said it appears she “falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, potentially committing mortgage fraud under the criminal statute.”

“This has included falsifying residence statuses for an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based residence and an Atlanta, Georgia-based property in order to potentially secure lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms,” Pulte wrote. 

THE FED OFFICIAL WHO CORRECTLY PREDICTED INFLATION COULD FALL WITHOUT A RECESSION

Should Cook leave the Fed's governing board, it would provide Trump an opportunity to appoint a member who would support his goal of cutting interest rates, which Chairman Jerome Powell has repeatedly declined to do. 

“Powell has a chance to do the right thing by the law,” regarding Cook, Pulte said in vague remarks about the chairman's role in the affair during an CNBC interview this week, adding that “we'll see” whether Powell knew about Cook's mortgages.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Russia continued its brutal attacks against Ukraine on Thursday, launching what Ukrainian officials called a “massive combined air strike” on multiple areas throughout the country. 

Russia launched 574 drones and 40 missiles into Ukraine on Thursday, ABC News reported. Most of the drones and missiles were intercepted and destroyed. Yet, several were able to hit targets in Ukraine, one of which was an American electronics manufacturer, according to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha.  

Sybiha blasted the attack by Russia, saying it was another attack on a civilian target. 

“Contrary to all efforts to end the war, Russia undertook a massive combined air strike on Ukraine overnight,” Sybiha posted on his X account.

“Hundreds of drones, hypersonic, ballistic, and cruise missiles on civilian and energy infrastructure,” he said. “One of the missiles struck a major American electronics manufacturer in our westernmost region, leading to serious damage and casualties. A fully civilian facility that has nothing to do with defense or the military.” 

“This is not the first Russian attack on American businesses in Ukraine, after strikes on Boeing offices in Kyiv earlier this year and other attacks,” he added. “No military logic or necessity, just terror against people, businesses, and normal life in our country.”

The attacks come less than a week after Russian President Vladimir Putin met with President Donald Trump in Alaska to discuss possible ways to end the war in Ukraine. It also comes three days after Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other European leaders at the White House about a resolution to the war.

Zelensky also criticized the attack on Thursday, categorizing it as another Russian assault on civilian targets, including “infrastructure facilities, residential buildings, and our people.”

“Several cruise missiles were lobbed against an American-owned enterprise in Zakarpattia,” Zelensky said in a post on X. “It was a regular civilian business, supported by American investment, producing everyday items like coffee machines. And yet, it was also a target for the Russians. This is very telling.”

Zelensky also said 15 people were injured in the bombing. He added that the incident is the latest example of why increased efforts are needed to stop the war, specifically mentioning sanctions and tariffs.

“And the Russians carried out this attack as if nothing has changed at all, as if there are no global efforts to stop this war,” Zelensky said. “This requires a response. There is still no signal from Moscow that they truly intend to engage in substantive negotiations and end this war. Pressure is needed. Strong sanctions, strong tariffs.

The Washington Examiner's homeland security reporter, Anna Giaritelli, appeared on the Sean Hannity Show Wednesday to recount the aftermath of the attack against her.

In 2020, Giaritelli suffered a random attack outside of Union Station. A homeless man lunged at her, which prompted a struggle where she was sexually assaulted in broad daylight. 

Months after the attack, he was arrested. However, the Metropolitan Police Department's “Crime Cards” online statistics page omits this man. Giaritelli described how she felt about the District of Columbia “gaslighting” her.

“It was infuriating, and you know after that type of crime, you're not in your right mind,” Giaritelli said “Trying to overcome that and then trying to understand at the same time that your city is gaslighting you. ‘It's not a big deal, we're going to try him by the Feds.' It's a big deal but it's also not a big deal.”

Giaritelli eventually moved away from the district.

“At the end of the day, I can't rely on the city to have my back,” Giaritelli said. “I felt physically unsafe but I felt so let down by the city that I loved.”

President Donald Trump's two most recent international summits—in Alaska last week with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and then at the White House this week with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky—included some notable fashion statements. Zelensky arrived in a proper suit instead of the military-style fatigues that he wore the last time he met with Trump, in February. But the more startling sartorial choice came from Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov: Lavrov arrived in Alaska in a sweatshirt (already a bold choice), and this one was adorned in big, black block letters with C.C.C.P., the Russian initials for the U.S.S.R. The message was widely interpreted as a rallying cry for old-style Russian imperialism and a somewhat trollish move by the foreign minister, who had arrived at a meeting ostensibly designed to discuss ending that very thing. But maybe the more urgent question is: Was the significance of this message entirely lost on Trump?

On the campaign trail ahead of his second term, Trump repeatedly said that he would end the Ukraine war within 24 hours of taking office. With this latest pair of summits, Trump was equally optimistic: Close the deal! Win the Nobel Prize! But the forces driving this war—Putin's nostalgia for a bygone era among them—are too deep and stubborn to easily yield to Trump's brand of dealmaking.

In this episode of Radio Atlantic, we talk with Anne Applebaum, who has been studying Ukraine and Russia for decades and understands their leaders' underlying motivations. We also speak with politics and national-security writer Vivian Salama, who knows what Trump's limitations are and explains what the next possible moves could be.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: The past seven days brought two very strange international summits: one where President Donald Trump rolled out an actual red carpet on American soil for Russian President Vladimir Putin.

News host 1: A high-stakes moment on the world's stage.

News host 2: It was Putin's first time back on U.S. soil in more than a decade. He received a grand welcome, complete with a military flyover and a red-carpet rollout.

Rosin: A few days later, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the White House with a hastily mobilized posse of European leaders.

News host 3: The historic sequel: President Trump and Ukraine's President Zelensky back at the White House.

News host 4: The two leaders striking a cordial, collegial tone and also somewhat optimistic.

Rosin: The summits were historic, momentous—if more than a little chaotic. And yet it's unclear what, if anything, changed as a result of them. The war grinds on. Civilians are still dying in Ukrainian cities, with Russians striking even as Zelensky was in Washington.

Trump approached the two Ukraine talks with his usual brand of optimism. Let's close the deal! Win the Nobel Prize! But—and this will come as a huge shock—ending a war is not so simple.

I'm Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic.

To help us understand what happened this week, what changed and what didn't, and what really needs to happen for this to end well, we have staff writer Anne Applebaum, a longtime reporter on both Russia and Ukraine, and staff writer Vivian Salama, who covers politics and national security.

Vivian, welcome to the show.

Vivian Salama: Thanks for having me.

Rosin: Anne, thanks for joining us.

Anne Applebaum: Thanks, Hanna.

Rosin: And before we begin, I want to say that we're recording this conversation at 10 a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday because anything could happen. This is an evolving story.

Vivian, you were actually at the White House for Monday's meeting between Trump, Zelensky, and the European leaders. What did you take from watching it up close that the rest of us might not have seen?

Salama: I have covered the White House now since, let's say, late 2016, when Donald Trump was elected the first time. And I have to say, I've never, ever seen the White House so chaotic.

Rosin: Really?

Salama: I've never seen so many people, journalists included, and I'm not talking about just European and American journalists. There were Iranian journalists and Japanese journalists—I mean, just to show you how significant an event this was and how much the world is sort of looking at Washington at that moment to see if this would indeed result in a breakthrough, or if it's just talks to have more talks.

Rosin: So what you took from that is: The world's eyes are watching. Like, that was the symbolism for you, or was it that chaos is happening?

Salama: Well, a little bit of both. To be fair, the world's eyes were definitely watching. But there was also an element of chaos, just how quickly the event came together, you know, these leaders flying in on short notice. The White House loves protocol. It loves to have days and months, sometimes, to organize things, to book hotel rooms, and to do all this. I mean, all these leaders, they come with big delegations. You know, the city was basically turned upside down.

And remember, the city was already turned upside down because we were in a so-called state of an emergency because, you know, the National Guard has been rolled out and our police federalized. And so just days prior, we were sort of already in a state of chaos, and then suddenly, you have these world leaders descending upon us on almost no notice. It definitely set the tone for the day.

Rosin: Right. I get it. It's like a Beyoncé concert on short notice.

Salama: Absolutely.

Rosin: It's like a huge event, but in a totally mad way.

Anne, so you're watching this over from Europe. It all came together very quickly. What is the view from Europe as this is all happening?

Applebaum: So just to give you some context, we're in the middle of August, and in most European countries, this is absolutely the height of summer vacation, and everything is shut. Offices, schools, shops—nobody is doing anything. And the fact that so many heads of state were willing to get on a plane on basically 24 hours' notice and fly to Washington, I think, tells you how unbelievably alarming the Alaska summit appeared here.

Rosin: Oh. So it's alarming because we're thinking it as a sort of, you know: The entourage showed up; they're supporting Zelensky. That's amazing. But you're saying it's coming out of a fear.

Applebaum: Fear and confusion and a sense that maybe the White House doesn't really understand the rules of the game.

So what happened in Alaska was that Putin got exactly what he wanted. He was treated as a world leader, as a superpower leader. There were American soldiers kneeling on the tarmac, rolling out the red carpet for him. The American president stood on the red carpet and waved and clapped at him.

He had exactly the treatment that he wanted. He had the TV pictures that he wanted. And he went home having offered nothing and given nothing. He still never said that he wants to end the war. He still never said that he would stop fighting. He's never said that he recognizes Ukrainian sovereignty. So he has given away nothing.

Rosin: Right.

Applebaum: And Trump, interviewed afterward, said the summit was 10 out of 10, and everything was great. And, you know, now Zelensky is going to Washington, and the instinct was We all need to be there to avoid a repeat of February, and also to explain to the president that the war hasn't ended yet and we may have a long way to go. I mean, I think what was also alarming was that Trump had begun using Putin's language, so he dropped this word cease-fire, and he started talking vaguely about peace negotiations.

And this is what Putin wants because peace negotiations mean we can vaguely negotiate and he can keep fighting. Whereas it's in Europe's interest and Ukraine's interest and everybody else's interest that there be a cease-fire, that the war stop at least for some period of time.

And so he was using Putin's language, he was playing Putin's game, and Europeans felt that they better show up.

Rosin: Okay, so they came in with a kind of maternal attitude—like, We have to tell you something; we have to teach you something. There's something dangerous going on. And did that happen?

What Vivian said was it was giant, but it was also chaotic. And it was hard, honestly, to read the signals coming out of the meeting. So what is the biggest change that you read, coming out?

Applebaum: The biggest change was that they got Trump to talk about security guarantees, even in an unclear way.

And you're right, by the way, about the chaos. I mean, nobody really knows anything, and it's not clear whether anything has been decided or anything has changed. But to get Trump to acknowledge that any end to the war or any cease to the fighting, whatever we're calling it—truce, temporary pause, whatever—is very dangerous because Russia could restart the war at any time. And to prevent that, Europeans want Americans to understand that there has to be something given to Ukraine to prevent the Russians from invading again. So there needs to be some longer term—they're using the term security guarantees.

I mean, it's a tricky thing because, actually, Ukraine already has security guarantees from the United States. This was back in 1994. There's something called the Budapest Memorandum, signed by America, Russia, the U.K., and a couple others, that was meant to guarantee Ukraine's borders, and so on. So theoretically, it's something that exists already. It's just that it was never ratified; it was never a big treaty.

And so now the Europeans got Trump thinking along those lines, and they consider that to have been useful to push him in the direction of understanding that you need a structure to end a war. You don't end it just by stopping the fighting. You need to have other longer-term solutions.

Rosin: Okay. I understand. This is strange because it's like, basically, they're trying to educate him on basic things. You can't just wave your wand and end a war and say a word cease-fire and roll out the red carpet, and everything is fine. Like, you have to actually do something—you have to attend to the details.

Applebaum: This is not how you end wars. You have low-level meetings. You bring together under neutral negotiators, you discuss what the issues are, and then you have the meeting of the big leaders at the very end.

But this is all being done backwards, and that, I think, is also adding to the chaos. So people have the impression, Something big has been achieved, when actually, we still don't know whether Russia wants to end the war or not.

Rosin: Right. Understood.

Vivian, the leaders were received differently by Trump this time around, like Zelensky, for example. Can you describe how and why it was significant? And why are you laughing?

Salama: Because Zelensky was actually the only one received by Trump.

Rosin: Oh, I see.

Salama: The other ones were received by his head of protocol, which is pretty unusual as well. He was inside the White House, and his head of protocol went out, one by one, individually welcoming the leaders.

He did have some fanfare for Zelensky. The color guard was out at the White House along the driveway, and he did come out of the West Wing and greet him and do all of that. But there was no official red-carpet welcoming or—you know, there was a military-jet flyover when he welcomed Putin, which is pretty extraordinary.

None of that was there for Zelensky, but he did have a warmer greeting than perhaps we'd anticipated. Also, because of the fact that their February meeting was so explosive, you know, listeners may remember that epic encounter that Zelensky had with Trump in February—

Rosin: And J. D. Vance.

Salama: —and J. D. Vance. And Secretary of State Marco Rubio was there, where the entire Oval Office spray, where the journalists go in. It devolved very quickly into a shouting match because they accused Zelensky of not showing enough gratitude to the United States for its support. And so voices were raised, and it became a very, very awkward event.

You know, going from that to this week's events, where Zelensky showed up in a suit, for starters, because he was criticized by some pro-Trump supporters and pro-Trump journalists that he was not wearing a suit and that he was disrespecting the American president by doing that. This time he showed up in the same outfit that he wore at the Vatican to the pope's funeral, which was a black sort of cargo blazer and black pants and a black button-down shirt.

Rosin: So, okay. How to read all this. Is that, first of all, a midway concession on Zelensky's part, not a full concession? And on Trump's part, I'm trying to understand what you're saying about how he greeted the European leaders, because in words, he said, Oh, I'm glad they came. It's all good. It's good he has an entourage. But in the room, was there some different signal he was sending to this whole posse of people who showed up?

Salama: So he was with Zelensky already when the Europeans arrived. And so, you know, we have to kind of forgive him for not going out and saying hello and greeting the European leaders individually. As far as Zelensky making concessions, yes, he had to make a lot of concessions this time around because of the fact that that first encounter, in February, went so badly that even European leaders afterwards really took Zelensky aside and gave him a talking to, in terms of the way that you manage Donald Trump. And to do so, you cannot engage him.

Rosin: Yeah.

Salama: And Zelensky did engage him that time around. He did kind of try to put up a fight, and they told him that that's not gonna be a winning battle, that Ukraine needs the United States more than the United States needs Ukraine at this point, and he has to go in there and play the game. And so he did this time around. Obviously, the substance coming out of it, you know, was significant as a result. Whether or not it results in anything, you know, it remains to be seen.

But Anne talked about security guarantees. That definitely is a huge game changer for Trump in terms of his, even, political stance. I covered the campaign last year, and this was a huge issue. Trump repeatedly said on the campaign trail, We're done with supporting foreign wars. And just to allude to the fact that we are going to have security guarantees, that the U.S. will support Ukraine moving forward, that really goes far from anything that he had ever promised on the campaign trail.

Rosin: So it is real? I mean, that is real.

Salama: They're looking at it, and Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt yesterday—so that was Tuesday—she went to the podium and said that the president was even considering having U.S. pilots be part of those security guarantees. That's extraordinary and such a huge departure from what he was saying on the campaign trail, where he was like, Enough with the weapons. Enough with the money. We're done with these wars.

[Music]

Rosin: When we're back: Donald Trump's changing opinion of Vladimir Putin, and whether that offers hope for Ukraine. That's in a moment.

[Break]

Rosin: Vivian, since Trump's been elected, he seems to change his views about Putin. Like, he's warm to Putin, but then Putin does something that frustrates him. Where is he now in his views on Putin?

Salama: We've seen a pretty remarkable evolution in the way that Trump has, at least in his public comments, regarded and viewed Putin. Also, his advisers tell me that he has changed his tune, so to speak.

Rosin: Changed his tune—like, understood who Putin is and what he's about?

Salama: At least has become a little more skeptical of Putin. Whereas, you know, in the first administration, he was really open to hearing Putin out, being influenced by Putin.

You know, I remember in the early days of his first administration, one of his top advisers explained this scene to me where Putin, in a very soft-spoken, almost mumbling voice, lectured Trump about, you know, Kyivan Rus history dating back to the 11th century, and just to explain to him that Ukraine is part of Russia and always should be. And Trump sort of listened intently and absorbed a lot of what Putin was saying to him.

That coupled with a few other instances during his first administration: the sort of, what he calls, the “Russia-, Russia-, Russiagate” of the investigation by the special counsel into influences of the Russian government on the Trump campaign. And then you had the first impeachment, where, you know, the so-called perfect call with Zelensky, when Zelensky was first elected as president, that led to Trump's first impeachment because he had asked him to do favors against his political opponents. All of that sort of played into his mind of Russia as a great nation led by a powerful man and Ukraine as a corrupt, backstabbing nation.

Flash-forward to his second administration, and I think, you know, he had been talking so much during his campaign about, you know, I will get the Ukraine-Russia war solved within 24 hours of being elected president. Well, that didn't happen. And obviously, we know governing is a lot harder than campaigning, and so he learned very quickly that this was going to be a complicated matter.

But what ended up happening is that Putin didn't sort of pick up the phone and rush to call Trump, either to congratulate him or anything else, when he took office, and he started to become very resentful of that, coupled with the fact that when he finally did talk to Putin, Putin was like, I would never harm the Ukrainians. Everything is, you know, it's fine. I'm never gonna do anything wrong, and I'm gonna stop the bombing, and let's just talk this out. And then the next day, he would bomb a school. And Trump has actually said repeatedly that, you know, He assures me that he's not gonna do anything, but then he does, and I don't really like that.

And so between that and some advisers who are around him, who have really worked hard to make Trump realize that Putin's not your friend—now, does that mean he likes Zelensky more? Mmm—I don't know about that. But, you know, he's at least cautiously dealing with Putin a bit more than we saw in the first Trump administration.

Rosin: Anne, can we get into the tectonic shifts? What the European leaders were afraid of, what we see reforming as this strange new alliance, where the U.S. seemingly sides with Russia against European allies. Coming out of this meeting, how do you see that shift differently, if at all?

Applebaum: It's not clear to me, honestly, what has really changed. It seems to me that Trump's instincts are to agree with the last person he spoke to. Most people assumed that he changed his language after Anchorage because of things Putin said to him.

Steve Witkoff very frequently parrots things that sound like they're coming from Putin as well. So, you know, he's influenced by them when he talks to them. And he's influenced by the Ukrainians and the Europeans when he talks to Europeans.

Rosin: Let's just say: He's the special envoy to the Middle East.

Applebaum: Yes. Steve Witkoff is the special envoy to Russia and to the Middle East. He's somebody with no background in diplomacy and no knowledge of Russian or Ukrainian history.

Salama: He's a real-estate executive.

Rosin: He's a real-estate executive, yeah.

Applebaum: He's a real-estate executive who, as I said, frequently repeats things that clearly come from Putin or from people around Putin. And it often looks like what Trump is doing is seeking to emerge as the winner from whatever situation he's in. Whether he's in Anchorage or whether he's in Washington, it's important that he dominate the scene and that he run the show. I am not sure that he has a deeper strategy.

Rosin: You wrote after his meeting with Putin in Alaska that Trump has no cards in that situation. And you explained that, I think, in this conversation, the ways in which Putin emerged the winner from that. Do you think that's changed? Like, did Trump come out of this meeting with Zelensky with some cards or some things to play against Putin? Like, the security guarantees, for example.

Applebaum: Maybe. I mean, the point is that—really, almost unnoticed—Trump has been dismantling American sanctions on Russia. These are commercial sanctions that require constant updating. This administration hasn't been updating them. He's been cutting or seeking to cut funding for the Russian-language media that the U.S. has supported for many decades. He's twice cut military aid to Ukraine. There have been many negative gestures towards Zelensky, and so on, that we've already talked about.

The Russians see all of that, and they understand it all as a package of Trump reducing his ability to play in the situation, reducing his influence, and so on. So when I say he has no cards, it doesn't mean that the United States can't do anything. It means that Trump has been reducing what he's able to do. And if everybody else sees that—the Europeans see it, you know, Russians obviously see it, Ukrainians obviously see it. I don't know that Americans see it, but everybody else does.

Rosin: Yeah. It's difficult to read, because on the one hand, you're describing a systematic shift in negotiating position. But on the other hand, the fact that he changes given any meeting means that kind of is a card. It's like I can have a meeting with Zelensky and the European leaders, and I can completely shift my position and talk about security guarantees, and then that's my card. You know, he's a little unpredictable.

Applebaum: Talking about European security guarantees gives the Russians something new to be nervous about.

Rosin: Right.

Applebaum: Remember, for them, you know, their assumption, I think right now we can safely say, is that they still think they're gonna win the war.

Rosin: The Russians?

Applebaum: The Russians.

Rosin: Well, they are winning the war, aren't they?

Applebaum: Hmmm—no. They're not winning. They're not losing, but they're not winning. You know, at the current rate of fighting, they will conquer the rest of Donbas in four years.

Rosin: Four years.

Applebaum: So they're, you know, putting a lot of pressure on Ukraine, but they're not winning very fast. But their assumption is that they will win because the U.S. will withdraw its support, and Europe will get tired, and Ukrainians will get tired, and so on. So they're still operating on that assumption. And the way that we change their minds and convince them that they're not winning is precisely by saying, No, actually we're gonna add more. We're gonna do not just security guarantees, but we're gonna do new sanctions, we're gonna do new aid for Ukraine, we're gonna change the rules again, we're gonna do a big shake-up.

And to be fair, there are people in Washington who understand that. And actually there are a number of Republican and Democratic senators who've been trying to push the U.S. in that direction for a long time. And, you know, this war is over when the Russians understand that they can't win. And for the last six months, we've been giving them the impression that they still can win. So we need to change that calculus.

And as I said, Europeans understand that. That's why they were in Washington. The Senate understands that. That's why there's a Senate bill on the table to do that. Not clear whether Trump understands that or not.

Rosin: I see. So the important thing is what you just said, giving Putin the impression that he cannot win the war. That, to you, is the important card to play. That's the important pressure to keep on Russia, in whatever way that happens.

Applebaum: Yes.

Rosin: Got it.

Applebaum: Yes, and Alaska was a step in the opposite direction.

Rosin: So, Vivian, what kind of peace deals are under discussion? Besides the security guarantees, did you get a realistic sense in Washington what is possible at this moment? There's pressure from Senators. There's Trump who's unpredictable. What seemed doable?

Salama: Well, one of the things on the Sunday shows after the Putin summit, but before the Europeans came to town, was this notion of concessions. Both Steve Witkoff, who we were just talking about, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were out there, talking about the fact that when you have a negotiation and you want to reach a compromise, both sides have something to gain and have something to lose, and that's just inevitable.

And that's the kind of talk that makes the Europeans very nervous, certainly Ukraine. Where Ukraine wanted to go, not just—you know, Washington often talks about the February 2022 borders, the territory that was taken by Russia after February 2022, when it launched this full-scale invasion.

But in the Ukrainians' mind, they've been fighting for their territory since 2014. They're talking about Crimea and the contested parts of eastern Ukraine that have been under stress long before 2022. And so they believe that not only should they regain that territory back, they fight for Crimea too.

And Washington has tried to kind of settle Ukraine's mind and say, you know—and even during the Biden era, where they say—Let's just talk about February 2022 borders, or you might lose Crimea. Let's see how it goes. But at least we're gonna try to fight for eastern Ukraine. The Trump administration kind of talks more in terms of freezes, where they say, Territory that was lost after February 2022, you're gonna have to cut your losses.

And that is something that not only the Ukrainians believe is a nonstarter, but that the rest of Europe sees as very alarming because they believe that that kind of concession will just embolden Putin, where he says, Okay, this was a victory now. Let's play along, and we could regroup and kind of expand our gains.

Rosin: So everything you just said sounds like a recipe for not agreement.

Salama: It is so hard to imagine Ukraine accepting anything less than at least the borders before February 2022. And that would be really twisting their arms.

And remember, for Russia—for Putin in particular—this is not about just a little bit of territory in eastern Ukraine. This is existential in Putin's mind for the future of Russia. He believes Ukraine does not have the right to exist. He believes it is part of greater Russia and they have to regain it as part of that legacy.

And so for him, he will stop at nothing to regain that. Whether it's, you know, play along now and then revisit the war later, you know, that remains to be seen. And so there is a concern, especially across Europe, European officials I speak with, about this naivete within the Trump administration, where they're so eager to cut a deal, but in doing so, you're redrawing the map of Europe and emboldening Putin. And so that is something that the Europeans, certainly—it was a big reason why they jumped on that plane on 24 hours' notice, not only to help Zelensky kind of avoid a catastrophic meeting, like the one in February, but also to moderate Trump's whims and say, you know, Yeah, we want a deal, but we want a deal that ensures the security and, you know, the sanctity of Ukraine.

Applebaum: You know, it's also really important to understand that Putin has not offered to concede anything. He's not giving back territory that he's conquered. And more than that, he's demanding territory that he can't conquer, that he hasn't been able to conquer—in fact, that he hasn't been able to conquer since 2014. And this is the rest of this Donbas province. So he's offering nothing.

And I think the second point to make that's very important is that this is not a war over territory. Russia does not need more territory. This is a war to damage and undermine the sovereignty and legitimacy of the Ukrainian state as a prelude to undermining it and eventually taking it over or making it into some kind of state that's reliant on Russia.

And the Russians are also perfectly happy to try doing that again through other kinds of pressure. You know, maybe they could end the war on unfavorable terms for Ukraine, then try to unseat Zelensky, then try to use propaganda to convince Ukrainians they were robbed. I mean, there's a whole kind of sequence of events that could follow.

So the point is that until they have given up that goal—you know, the goal of destroying Ukraine as a sovereign nation—then the war is not over. And to pretend that it's over is very dangerous.

Rosin: That's complicated. Those are old Soviet dreams. I mean, basically, he wants the relationship he had with Estonia and so many other, you know, territories. How do you make somebody give up that? Like, how do you break someone of that goal?

Applebaum: I remain convinced that the only way to do it is to persuade him that he can't win—it can't be done, that Ukraine is too strong, its alliances are too powerful.

Rosin: Got it.

Salama: I mean, just to emphasize: I don't think you can break that mentality. I mean, just to show you as an example, Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister of Russia, arrived in Alaska last week wearing a sweatshirt that said C.C.C.P. on it, which is the Soviet Union, U.S.S.R. They are still living in that era, very much so. And some of it is mind games, obviously, but a lot of it is also just this nostalgia for that era.

Rosin: Right.

Salama: Can I just add one more thing here, because we were talking about this earlier? I spent most of 2022 on the front lines in Ukraine, and I gotta tell you, the one thing I heard over and over again was that they believe that Putin has more stamina than the entire West combined, that the West will eventually move on, whether for politics, whether for economic reasons, whether because they just can't sustain all this aid, military and economic aid to Ukraine. But Putin is playing for the long game, and they knew that in Ukraine.

I mean, this is a former part of the Soviet Union. The Russians are not strangers to them. They know the Russians better than any of us, and they know that Putin is just waiting for the West to get tired.

Rosin: Interesting. So it's almost like they saw this moment coming, and that actually brings more significance to the fact that the European leaders showed up. It's like, Wait—we're actually not out of patience yet. Like, We can be ripped from our vacations and show up for you on short notice.

Salama: Yes. And it's also why Zelensky has to hustle so hard, because he does not want the West to forget about his country.

Rosin: Yeah. Okay, so you guys have described a lot of complicated mechanics that need to happen in order to bring this to a good place. We seem very far away from it, and Trump seems very far from understanding all of these dynamics that you just described.

So what happens now? I mean, Trump said repeatedly at the Monday summit that he wants a joint meeting between him, Zelensky, and Putin, and that's what needs to happen. Is that realistic? How likely is that?

Salama: They are cautiously optimistic at the White House that this is gonna work out. The Kremlin has already suggested it won't, so I don't really know where we go from here. On Tuesday, the press secretary said that, you know, the wheels are in motion to try to get Putin and Zelensky to sit down together,

And then, obviously, this broader summit—Zelensky seems game, but you know, it takes two to tango in this case. It would be pretty extraordinary if it happens. Gosh, I will camp out for days just to be a fly on that wall. But not a lot of people are very optimistic that that's gonna happen.

Rosin: All right, well if it does, we will have you both back on. Thank you for joining me today and helping us understand what happened.

Salama: Thanks for having me.

Applebaum: Thank you.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","What Trump Actually Wants From a Ukraine Deal","https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/08/russia-ukraine-trump-putin-zelensky/683950/","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 15:05:59 GMT","

The president has one goal clearly in mind—and his fixation may benefit Kyiv.

Whenever Donald Trump announces an international meeting about the Russia-Ukraine war, his critics immediately begin talking about Munich 1938 or Yalta 1945. The analogies are not only misplaced, but misleading. What happened in Anchorage last week and in the follow-on visit by European leaders to Washington on Monday was something far less tragic, and far less serious, than the comparisons would imply.

Too often, the commentary focused on trivialities. For the Trump-Putin summit: Was the B-2-bomber overflight when Vladimir Putin arrived in Alaska an undeserved honor or a sobering reminder of American power? How damaging was it when Trump whinged, once again, about “Russia, Russia, Russia” and repeated his delusions about having won the 2020 election? For the Washington meeting with European leaders and Vlodymyr Zelensky: Was the Ukrainian president's black suit a sign of submission, or a display of good sense? Did it make a difference that the European delegation was met by the chief of protocol and not the president in all his glory?

Fluff and flummery. The muddled outcomes (did the Russians accept the idea of Western security guarantees to Ukraine? Did the Ukrainians agree to cede territory to Russia?) began with the prelude to the meetings. The confused signals going in resulted in part from an incompetent special envoy, Steve Witkoff, being unable to get straight what the Russians had offered in preliminary talks—a rookie mistake if ever there was one, although par for the hapless real-estate lawyer turned diplomatic ingenue. But they resulted as well from the very different positions of the four parties, and those in turn emerged from their motivations, which explain a lot about what happened and what may lie ahead.

Putin's motivation is simple, even if Witkoff and Trump do not really understand it: He seeks to dominate Ukraine, seize what pieces of it he can, and eradicate its democratic government and national independence. For Zelensky, it is only slightly more complicated: He wishes to preserve Ukrainian sovereignty and freedom of action, and to guarantee its membership in the larger European community of free countries—all while refusing to recognize de jure the loss of its territory to Moscow. For the European leaders, it is also a bit more complex: They want to help Ukraine achieve those things while ensuring continued American engagement in European security against a menacing Russia.

Tom Nichols: Trump keeps defending Russia

Trump's motivation is actually the simplest of all: He wants a Nobel Peace Prize. We know that because he cannot stop talking about it. This is what makes a true sellout of Ukraine unlikely. For Trump to have that glorious moment when five otherwise insignificant Norwegians bless his contributions to humanity, he needs the willing cooperation of Zelensky and the Europeans. If he merely handed Ukraine over to Russia, as some observers say he has always wished to do, no Nobel: The Norwegians, having some claim to democratic scruples, would not deliver, however dubious some of their past awards.

No, at some level, Zelensky and his European supporters will have to find the deal, whatever form it may take, to be better than continuing the war, and for now, nothing on offer seems to meet that test.

There is another reason that the United States has less leverage than Trump may think: He has weakened his hand by silly concessions. The meeting with Putin was a gift to the Russian dictator, for which Washington received nothing. The easing of some sanctions on Russia is a similar unilateral gift. Trump's long-threatened secondary sanctions have yet to materialize. Most important, by ruling out putting American forces on the ground in Ukraine, the American president has, so to speak, discarded a trump card.

The American foreign-policy establishment has become so accustomed to denigrating Europe's leadership that it has not fully taken on board the remarkable coherence and adroitness of its leaders' performance in Washington. They spoke with one voice, and they skillfully combined flattery (which is indispensable in dealing with Trump) and a quiet firmness (also essential). Zelensky, too, hit all the right notes, and the result was an atmosphere of geniality which may not have been substantive, but was useful.

America's weakened hand is the result also of the quiet, limited, but nonetheless significant mobilization of the Ukrainian and European defense industrial base. Ukraine is the largest producer of its own excellent military hardware, followed by the Europeans, and then the United States, which provides only 20 percent of the hardware (although, admittedly, the most advanced and in some cases unique 20 percent). Even that contribution, however, will no longer be paid for by the U.S. but by European states—as a result of the Trump administration throwing away yet another source of leverage over Ukraine, the provision of military aid without strings attached.

In theory, the administration could try to coerce a Ukrainian deal by cutting off all intelligence sharing and refusing to sell weapons to Europe for Ukraine. But even there, as a senior intelligence official from the continent recently informed me, the Europeans have been quietly figuring out ways to minimize the loss from certain unique capabilities (particularly space-based reconnaissance). Cutting off all aid would also stir protest even from some Trump loyalists in the Republican Party, and besides, Trump always wants to sell American products. Most important, such blatant arm-twisting means no Nobel, and Trump can't have that.

Vivian Salama and Jonathan Lemire: Zelensky wasn't going to repeat his Oval Office disaster

The trouble with the historical parallels that are now being drawn is that they inflate the capacity of the adversary that Ukraine faces and minimize Western leverage. The Munich 1938 analogy is dumb because the British and French leaders were then dealing with a powerful and vigorous Nazi Germany and operating under the shadow of the mass slaughter of World War I, which had taken place only 20 years earlier. Czechoslovakia was bound to succumb to German demands unless the Soviet Union joined in its defense, and that was made impossible by Stalin's demands to London, Paris, and Warsaw. The Yalta 1945 analogy is also dumb: Yes, Poland was consigned to Soviet occupation, but the Red Army held the territory, and to pry it loose there and elsewhere in Eastern Europe would have required a new war, which neither the United States nor Great Britain was prepared to fight. Yalta was awful, but also unavoidable.

Instead, in the current circumstance, we have a Ukraine whose heroism and persistence is extraordinary, a far larger country with a more capable military than either the Czechs in 1938 or the Polish Home Army in 1945 had at their disposal. Ukraine also shares borders with its Western supporters. We have a third party—the European states—that retains agency as well. In Russia, Ukraine and its supporters face neither a dynamic Germany nor a titanic Soviet superpower, but rather a creaky, corrupt dictatorship that has taken a million casualties; is suffering diplomatic setbacks everywhere from the Middle East to the Caucasus, to its northern flank; whose sovereign wealth fund has almost run dry; and whose economy is beset by inflation, wretched productivity, and falling oil prices. If Trump were as good a dealmaker as he claims to be, he would be focusing far more on exploiting Russia's weaknesses, which he can exacerbate if he wishes, than on basking in the chumminess of his KGB-trained counterpart, which is nothing more than deception.

No one knows how this war will end. Either side could collapse, or there could be some kind of freezing of the front line, unsatisfactory to both sides but guaranteeing Ukraine's independence and, to some measure, its security. When the war reaches its conclusion, it will probably surprise all of us, and none more than those who think Trump is as shrewd as he is often malign. He is not, and that is probably the only thing on which his counterparties can agree wholeheartedly.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

A series of viral videos has doubled as an ode to fed-up women and a repudiation of male expectations.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Sometime in the early aughts, the comedian Amy Poehler made a vulgar joke while sitting in the Saturday Night Live writers' room waiting for a midweek read-through to begin. As detailed in Tina Fey's 2011 memoir, Bossypants, Jimmy Fallon, who was also in the show's cast at the time, jokingly recoiled and told Poehler to stop it.

“It's not cute!” Fallon exclaimed. “I don't like it.”

“Amy dropped what she was doing, went black in the eyes for a second, and wheeled around on him,” Fey writes. “‘I don't fucking care if you like it.'”

I was brought back to Fey's Poehler-Fallon anecdote when a friend shared the first of Melani Sanders's “We Do Not Care” videos with me. Earlier this summer, Sanders, who identifies herself as a wife and mother, posted a short rant cum manifesto on Instagram, filmed in her car after a grocery run, in which she declared that she was not going to take it anymore.

What's “it”? Well, societal expectations about female comportment, for one thing. She does not care, she announces, that she doesn't have a “real bra” on. 

Sanders did not—does not—care about a bunch of other things, as she made clear in subsequent videos. She does not care about shaving her legs, or grooming her chin hairs, or having edge control in her hair. She does not care about wearing matching clothes, or that her hair isn't combed. She does not care about pointless small talk, about that flashing light in her car, or that her house is a hot mess.

Sanders's first post reminded me a bit of Jane O'Reilly's famous article, “Click! The Housewife's Moment of Truth,” which ran in the first issue of Ms. Magazine, in 1972. In her story, O'Reilly examined her friends' and neighbors' feminist awakenings—“click!” moments—about patriarchal expectations regarding women's unpaid labor, writing: “One little click turns on a thousand others.”

In Sanders's case, her click turned on thousands of others; at least half a dozen women forwarded that first video to me, and I suspect this was how many others came to it. Each of Sanders's videos is accompanied by thousands of comments, most by apparently delighted women who feel liberated by Sanders's exhortations. (Sanders, who notes that she's speaking for perimenopausal and menopausal women, often invites viewers to chime in with the things that they no longer care about, and seems to incorporate them in subsequent posts.)

Indeed, there is an element of call-and-response to the We Do Not Care Club, which Sanders herself has, consciously or not, encouraged. In that first post in May, Sanders used the first person. By the next day, she had switched over to the first-person plural. (“We don't care what's for dinner.”) A day later, Sanders just came out and said it: “We do not care about people-pleasing.”

Here's the thing: When Sanders says she doesn't care about “people-pleasing,” she's saying, in effect, that she doesn't care about pleasing men. This is, to my mind, the wonderfully subversive message that's gotten lost in the initial flurry of discussion about the We Do Not Care Club. That the majority of her audience is women makes perfect sense, given that the we in “We Do Not Care” clearly refers to them. That, in turn, suggests that the implied “you” in Sanders's statements is men, collectively.

Sanders's digital rebellion speaks both to and for a silent majority of women who are tired of contorting themselves to appeal to, or appease, male expectations of who they should be, whether those men are romantic partners, strangers, or Jimmy Fallon himself. And though Sanders calls the We Do Not Care Club a “movement” with “members,” I think it's more accurate to say that it is a revolt against misogyny.

Plenty of women seem to agree. Responses to her videos, I've noticed, frequently make Sanders's implicit critique of male expectations explicit. (A representative example: “We do not care if you don't like what you see, just look the other way!”) Commenting under a New York Times article about Sanders's club, one woman wrote, “I do not care about the male gaze.” Another noted: “In my early 40s, I started to gain weight and I noticed how it made me invisible to unwanted male attention, and I liked it.”

Of course, plenty of the things that Sanders and her followers do not care about seem to relate to the female gaze. You could argue that whether or not a woman has a pedicure or gray hair is as much about pleasing, or not offending, other women as it is about men. (Tina Fey again: “Women dress for other women in order to let them know what their deal is.”)

Women may be dressing for other women, but aren't we also dressing for men? After all, most women, whether or not we're always conscious of it, are subject to some form of male appraisal about how we look and behave, which can in turn affect the way we're able to move through the world. Even older women, who tend to go unseen by society and overlooked as vital, sexual beings, are reminded on a regular basis of the power of the male gaze—and how easily it can be revoked.

There's a lot that is freeing about getting older, including not giving as much of a damn. And it's important that Sanders says that her messages are meant for perimenopausal and menopausal women. Menopause is having a moment, and the We Do Not Care Club feels like a natural extension of the growing visibility of discussions about crepey skin and hot flashes and vaginal dryness. (In late June, Sanders was tapped as a spokesperson for the vaginal moisturizer Replens.) This is why seeing the 40-something Sanders reclining sideways on her bed wearing three pairs of glasses and marking off a list of things “we” do not care about that includes having chin hairs, unshaved legs, and cellulite that's visible in short shorts is so captivating.

But the messages contained within the We Do Not Care videos are, in the end, applicable to women of all ages. They're not just eruptions from a cohort of women for whom a lifetime's worth of expectations have reached their expiration date, but permission slips with which women of younger generations can eagerly anticipate a more unencumbered future—and perhaps even freedom in the present.

They need it. Photo filters and AI are changing how we present ourselves to the public, raising expectations about having the smoothest skin and the plumpest lips. An ascendant MAGA aesthetic that plays up what the fashion critic Vanessa Friedman has called “a retrograde gendered paradigm” jostles with trad-wife and wellness influencers who project visions of polished (and predominantly white) womanhood. And younger generations (much too young, I'd argue) are adopting expensive skin-care routines in order to, as the journalist Elise Hu put it, “optimize one's face” and address “the added burden of worrying earlier about wrinkles.”

These so-called Sephora tweens, inspired by online beauty influencers, appear to be succumbing to the opposite message that many of us with actual wrinkles are welcoming: embracing a more observable older femininity, replete with fine lines and emergent fat on our underarms—and, as Poehler would say, not fucking caring if others like it.

A few years ago, I wrote a story for this magazine about the power of saying no, in which I called on women to reject the socialization that begins in childhood and that nudges us to always be accommodating. I argued that we need to allow ourselves to refuse the things that are demanded of us, to erect and defend boundaries. This, I think, is why I, and so many others, have been so taken with the We Do Not Care Club. (One of Sanders's recent posts has more than 50,000 comments.) Because if the first step is for women to give themselves permission to say no, the We Do Not Care Club is the no itself.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

But that won't stop him from finding ways to make chaos.

Sign up for Trump's Return, a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.

The idea, it seems, came from the Russian president. “Vladimir Putin, smart guy,” Donald Trump told the Fox News television host Sean Hannity following the summit between the two leaders in Anchorage, Alaska. Putin, Trump reported, had told him, “You can't have an honest election with mail-in voting.” And that, apparently, spurred the president to act—sort of.

Days later, Trump posted on Truth Social that he would ban “MAIL-IN BALLOTS” in an “EXECUTIVE ORDER to help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm Elections.” He expanded on his plan during an Oval Office press conference ostensibly about the war in Ukraine, sitting next to a studiously blank-faced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. “We're going to end mail-in voting,” the president declared. “It's a fraud.”

Several days later, the promised executive order has yet to appear. Even if Trump does end up signing a document that claims to prohibit mail-in ballots, though, such an order would likely have little legal power. The American system for administering elections is highly decentralized: The work of deciding how people should vote and of helping them do so is largely carried out at the state and local levels, with the federal government playing only a minor role. Mail-in balloting, which is authorized at the state level by a state's legislature, is no exception. But as Americans have learned over the past six months, just because the president may lack legal authority to make a policy change does not mean he lacks the power to make an enormous mess.

Paul Rosenzweig: Trump is already undermining the next election

Trump's spree of second-term executive orders can be divided into several categories. Sometimes, he is exercising authority within the normal bounds of presidential power, though often to stupid or malicious ends; sometimes, there's genuine uncertainty as to whether the president can wield the power Trump claims for himself; and sometimes, Trump has arrogated to himself an authority that doesn't exist. An executive order banning mail-in ballots would fall into the final category. In an oddly professorial flourish in his Truth Social post, the president insisted, “Remember, the States are merely an ‘agent' for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes.” But this is not true. The Constitution establishes unambiguously that elections are carried out by each individual state, under state rules. Congress can establish additional instructions—but the president himself has no freestanding authority. Trump's promise to intervene anyway reflects his understanding of the presidency not as one branch of government constrained by the separation of powers, but as America's king.

For this same reason, two federal courts have already blocked significant portions of Trump's previous executive order on “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections,” which he signed in March. That order didn't bar mail-in ballots, but sought to implement a range of other election-related policies responding to Republican conspiracy theories around election fraud: mandating proof of citizenship during voter registration, requiring states to share voter rolls with the federal government, and forbidding the counting of any ballots that arrive after Election Day, among other changes. Even former Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell criticized the order as an unwise power grab. In an opinion barring several sections of the order from going into effect, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia explained, “The States have initial authority to regulate elections. Congress has supervisory authority over those regulations. The President does not feature at all.”

Any executive order claiming to outright ban mail-in ballots would immediately face a similar legal challenge. It's not even clear what levers Trump could attempt to pull. Though the president can use executive orders to direct federal officials, “there are no federal officials who govern whether states get to use mail ballots or not,” Justin Levitt, who studies the law of democracy at Loyola Law School, told me. And the White House simply has no authority to make these demands of state officials, Levitt said. “The president passing an executive order that purports to tell state election officials how to do their jobs is the same as me writing a note to a state election official on a Burger King receipt.” Perhaps Trump could try threatening to withhold federal funds from states unless they restrict access to mail-in ballots—but such an effort would be legally dubious under well-established precedents, and Congress has allocated so little in the way of election funding that there's not much to withhold.

Short on options, the White House will likely be left MacGyvering its way to a solution using equipment not really suited to the task. Project 2025, for example, suggested prosecuting former Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar for a 2020 legal opinion on the use of provisional ballots for mail-in balloting under Pennsylvania state law—a proposition that Levitt described to me as “crazy.” The Justice Department could threaten state and local election officials with similarly baseless investigations in an effort at intimidation. Prosecutors would encounter the small problem that no criminal statutes obviously apply to an election official legally handing out mail-in ballots. But the risk of a criminal investigation, even a meritless one, could still frighten election administrators.

Read: Trump says he is serious about staying in office past 2028

Trump's hatred of mail-in ballots dates back to 2016, when he complained that Colorado's shift to all-mail voting would enable fraud. As more states adopted mail-in ballots during the pandemic election of 2020, he seized on this development as a basis to spread claims that Democrats would try to use “fraudulent” mail-in votes to steal the presidency—an idea that would become a key claim of the Big Lie that Trump had won the 2020 election, and a driver of the attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021. Now that he has secured the presidency again, Trump may feel that he has an opportunity to finally right this imagined wrong. (On the same day that Trump posted his Truth Social announcement, the voting-machine manufacturer Dominion announced that it had secured a $67 million settlement with Newsmax over the far-right television network's promotion of conspiracy theories about the company in 2020.)

Yet if the goal is to corruptly tilt elections toward the Republican Party—“you're not going to have many Democrats get elected,” Trump promised when detailing his plans to end mail-in voting in the Oval Office—the president's mental model may be out-of-date. In the Trump era, the Republican coalition has come to rely on voters who follow politics less closely, vote less frequently, and are more likely not to cast a ballot if doing so is difficult. Limiting access to voting might have been politically helpful to Republicans in the past, but seems not to be now. That may be especially true in lower-turnout contests such as midterms, in which Democrats may see an advantage thanks to a more politically engaged voter base.

During the 2024 election, Trump's campaign staff seems to have been able to convince him to be quiet about his hatred of voting by mail long enough to increase Republicans' use of mail-in ballots. As the 2026 midterms draw closer, his advisers may have to struggle to contain him once again, whether or not he moves forward with an executive order. The risk created by Trump's attacks on mail-in ballots is less that Trump will actually succeed in limiting access to the franchise and that such limitations will actually tilt the playing field toward Republicans, and more that the president will—as he did in 2020—kick up enough doubt and confusion that a significant number of Americans no longer trust an election's results.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","‘Make McCarthy Great Again'","https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/08/laura-loomer-trump-era-joseph-mccarthy/683928/","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Laura Loomer has become the Joseph McCarthy of the Trump era.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

The first thing Laura Loomer wanted to know when I called her earlier this month was whether this was going to be a “hit piece.” The self-described investigative journalist and unofficial adviser to President Donald Trump is familiar with the genre. She had just attacked the United States Army for praising a recipient of the Medal of Honor. She would soon claim without evidence that Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene—another person comfortable trafficking in unsubstantiated allegations—“gave blow jobs in the back rooms of CrossFit gyms.” Soon after that, she said that Palestinian children receiving medical care in the United States posed a “dangerous” threat to American national security.

You never know just how far she will go, but that's the game she plays. I suggested at one point that her effort to get federal employees fired for supposed disloyalty to Trump recalled the Red Scare of the early 1950s, when Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin exploited the private musings and personal associations of alleged communist sympathizers to end their careers. She loved that.

“Joseph McCarthy was right,” Loomer responded without missing a beat. “We need to make McCarthy great again.”

She had toiled for a decade on the dark edges of relevance, pulling public pranks and getting chased off financial and social-media platforms for hate-speech violations. She was arrested after storming the stage at New York City's Shakespeare in the Park to protest a Trump-inspired Julius Caesar and kicked off Uber and Lyft for saying that she did not want Muslim drivers. She also lost two bids for GOP congressional nominations in Florida, symbolically refusing to concede the second because of the “voter fraud” she says was caused by her inability to communicate on social media. She found out at the end of last year that she would not get the White House job she thought she was promised, and lost her ability to make money on X after violating the platform's doxxing policies.

Yet, here we are. Loomer, the proud, defiant, extremist troll, is one of the most influential public figures in what is still the most important country on the planet—“back from the dead and rose from the ashes,” she told me. How did this come to pass? “I am a genuine person, and I speak my mind. I am not fake,” she offered. “It's a story of persistence. As I like to say, persistence will beat the resistance.”

Another explanation has to do with her champion and enabler, the most powerful person in the country, who has stuck with her despite the warnings, sneers, and eye rolls of his own senior advisers. “I know she's known as a radical right, but I think Laura Loomer is a very nice person,” Trump told reporters this month. His early mentor Roy Cohn had previously been an unapologetic adviser to McCarthy during his red-baiting Congressional hearings. Trump's subsequent political adviser, Roger Stone, a friend and admirer of Cohn, has been a mentor to Loomer.

Whatever the reason, her private research and public X posts have destroyed careers, shaped news cycles, and moved financial markets. Quite often, Trump doesn't just listen to Loomer—he does what she wants.

In just the first seven months of Trump's second presidency, she successfully lobbied Trump to end Secret Service protection for Joe Biden's children. She has pushed the president to fire six members of his National Security Council, remove three leaders at the National Security Agency, end an academic appointment at West Point, fire the director of the National Vetting Center at the Department of Homeland Security, dispatch an assistant U.S. attorney in California, and remove a federal prosecutor in Manhattan. After Trump's intel chief stripped 37 current and former national-security officials of their security clearance Wednesday, she claimed credit for first labeling 29 of them as threats to Trump.

Every day was another opportunity to grab headlines, to protect the president, to expose another potential saboteur. This phone call, included.

“Why do we want to have a woman who is pregnant, who is going to have to take maternity leave as soon as she is confirmed?” Loomer asked me. “You should make a decision: Do you want to have a career, or do you want a family?”

She was referring to Casey Means, a Stanford-trained doctor turned wellness influencer Trump nominated to be surgeon general. Loomer believes that Means is part of an extortionist, Marxist vanguard—led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—that will ultimately sabotage the Trump administration and the Republican Party. In her rapid-fire staccato—always urgent, indignant, agrieved—Loomer rattled off facts that she had uncovered about Means's metabolic-health company and her husband's past sympathies for Black Lives Matter. (Means did not respond to a request for comment.)

I stopped Loomer and asked her to go back: Did she really believe that pregnant women should not have careers? “You can have a family, and you can have a career,” Loomer responded, beginning what sounded like a pivot toward acknowledging that Congress outlawed employment discrimination based on motherhood back in 1978.

But that was not her point. “If you are going to be working in the federal government, don't you think it is a little abusive if you have a job where you can't bring your baby every day?” she asked me. “Are my tax dollars supposed to go to her because she doesn't use a condom? Is there not a man who is qualified?”

Not so long ago, people who spoke like Loomer were ostracized from political parties and mainstream conversations, cast as the fringe. Provocateurs once needed to find publishers to produce their pamphlets. Activists begged access from White House staff to get on the president's schedule. Opposition researchers depended on journalists to launder their work. And those who called themselves journalists operated by codes: no undisclosed financial arrangements with political actors, no explicit political advocacy, and extensive editing and legal vetting to assure accuracy. The system minimized a certain type of toxicity, while giving those who already had power—the owners of media outlets, the leaders of government and industry—a gatekeeping role.

The 32-year-old Loomer belongs to a new era, when any thought can be instantly published everywhere and the president is easy to reach on his cellphone. Despite the loss of her accounts on Facebook and Instagram, she has a growing audience of 1.7 million followers on her fully reinstated X account (up by about 30 percent since last year), a sponsored podcast on Rumble, and—she claims—an expanding roster of private clients, including major political donors, whose names she declines to disclose.

Top Trump advisers, unable to cast her away, regularly work with her behind the scenes. In addition to having calls and meetings with the president, Loomer speaks regularly with White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and Director of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel Sergio Gor, according to people familiar with the relationships. Loomer praises Wiles for being open to her work and has called Gor a friend. But she speaks of the White House overall as a self-dealing den of duplicity, where staff regularly conspire against the president she adores.

“Everyone is positioning themselves for a post-Trump GOP,” she told me, adding that Trump is often surprised by what she tells him about his own administration. “Every time I have these briefings, he looks at his staff and says, ‘How come you didn't tell me this?'”

It is a high-stakes game that threatens to broaden distrust within Trump's senior ranks. If isolated, once-anodyne facts from the past can sink careers; nearly anyone is suddenly vulnerable to exposure, setting Loomer up as a tip line for administration officials to inform on their office rivals, while potentially providing other powerful interests a lever to disappear their adversaries. “There are people who message me all the time,” Loomer boasted to me. “In every agency, I have sources.”

Last week, she got ahold of a video showing happy Palestinian refugees arriving in the San Francisco airport, owing to efforts by Heal Palestine, a group that provides treatment in the United States to children wounded in Gaza. The group says that the children and their families arrived on temporary visas and will return to the Middle East after treatment. She called the spectacle an “Islamic invasion” and asked the Trump administration to shut it down. A day later, the State Department announced a stop to “all visitor visas for individuals from Gaza” to review the situation. “It's amazing how fast we can get results from the Trump administration,” Loomer posted on X.

Not all of her efforts succeed. I asked her about her unsuccessful attempt to stop Trump's appointment of Colonel Earl G. Matthews as general counsel of the Department of Defense, making him one of the highest-ranking African Americans in the building. She had attacked Matthews for his past praise of former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, a Biden appointee, and his work with former Trump advisers turned foes such as former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley and National Security Adviser John Bolton. But she did not bring up those points with me. “He sounds like he is speaking Ebonics anytime he speaks,” she said. “I don't take anything he says seriously.” (Matthews, in fact, sounds like a U.S. Army colonel when he speaks. He did not respond to a request for comment.)

“I would rather be feared than loved,” Loomer added. “I don't need to be loved by people who work in Washington, D.C.”

Earlier this summer, Loomer told The New York Times that she had five paying clients for her research-consulting firm, an unusual side business for someone who describes themselves as a journalist. Now she says she has more, but she will not give a number. “It is not policy matters,” she told me, adding that some are corporate clients who want her to do “executive-level vetting.” “There are several billionaires I work with, and they have retained me to do their political vetting.”

The foggy boundaries between her activism, so-called journalism, and client work have created widespread concern that she is surreptitiously passing on information to promote the agendas of powerful interests.

After she began posting about the Puerto Rican bankruptcy authority, Trump fired its whole board, immediately improving the stock value of a major natural-gas company that was seeking a contract with the island. After she began attacking Republicans who wanted a clean break between Chevron and the Venezuelan government, Trump's team granted the company new sanctions carve-outs. After she resurfaced old political comments by Vinay Prasad, a top official at the Food and Drug Administration, he resigned his post, saying through a spokesperson that he “did not want to be a distraction to the great work of the FDA.”

Like many of Loomer's crusades, her attacks on Prasad focused on facts that would not have been disqualifying in the previous age when technocrats were hired for their abilities, not their ideological purity. She called Prasad, a hematologist-oncologist at the University of San Francisco, who had long been a critic of the FDA, a “trojan horse” and “saboteur” because he called himself a “Bernie Sanders liberal” in 2022 and wrote on Twitter in 2020 that he wanted Joe Biden to win—facts that did not trouble Kennedy, who was himself a Democrat until 2023. (Loomer accused Kennedy last week of preparing for a 2028 presidential bid, prompting him to announce that he was not running.)

Loomer's crusade against Prasad came soon after he decided to limit access to a Sarepta Therapeutics drug, following evidence that it causes severe liver damage; this led MAGA influencers to allege that Loomer was secretly working for the pharmaceutical company. Sarepta, through a spokesperson, said that it has not “engaged with nor associated with Laura Loomer.” She told me the same, even offering “to sign an affidavit” saying so. But the wholly unsubstantiated claims still played a role in undermining Loomer's case against Prasad; two senior Trump advisers told me that, although they had seen no proof of a connection, they believed the rumors. After he resigned, the White House invited Prasad to rejoin the administration, which he did about two weeks after leaving.

Loomer also denies taking money from Chevron or those with interests before the bankruptcy board of Puerto Rico. Although the obscurity of her targets raises suspicions, she said she has always taken on niche issues. She told me that she has been discussing legal action with her attorney against her public critics who accuse her of engaging in pay-to-play, a path that some of her critics have welcomed because of the prospect of uncovering her financial arrangements during discovery.

Those who have known her for years speak of her zeal and commitment as the purest form of MAGA. “It may shock a lot of folks in politics, but some of us are actually involved for reasons other than power, money, and fame,” Ted Goodman, a MAGA-aligned political operative who works for former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, told me. “She can't be bought and isn't swayed by monetary gain.”

Brian Ballard, one of the most influential Trump-aligned lobbyists in Washington, told me that he has not worked with Loomer, but he had nothing but praise. “I think she is incredibly effective, and I understand why people would want to hire her,” he said.

Trump and Loomer agree that a failure to sift through appointees' pasts in the first term undermined the president's ambitions. “If there would have actually been proper vetting systems set up in the first Trump administration, the Russian-collusion hoax never would have happened, the first impeachment never would have happened, the second impeachment never would have happened,” she explained on a recent episode of her podcast. Trump seems to have taken this advice to heart. In his second go-round as president, his administration has taken several steps that appear designed to eliminate dissent or checks on his power.

The problem is that no one is clear on what constitutes a fireable offense. Trump's top advisers, including Wiles, have been working intentionally, with Trump's support, to expand the tent of Republican politics by embracing leaders such as Kennedy, a scion of the most famous Democratic family, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, a former congresswoman who previously ran as a Democrat. Past liberal leanings, in this effort, are a benefit, not a liability. Trump has stocked his inner circle with people such as Vice President J. D. Vance, who once compared Trump to Adolf Hitler, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who once speculated mockingly about the size of Trump's manhood.

Like Trump, Loomer says that Vance and Rubio earned forgiveness because they have made amends. But at other times, Loomer has found herself on the wrong side of Trump. Loomer defended Trump's initial pick to lead NASA, Jared Isaacman, a friend of Elon Musk, even though Isaacman has given money to Democrats in the past. Others in the White House, including Gor, supported removing Isaacman amid Trump's high-profile fallout with Musk, leading Trump to withdraw Isaacman's name.

Trump has ignored other Loomer recommendations, such as her demand to fire Attorney General Pam Bondi over her handling of Justice Department records on the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. (Loomer says Trump is not implicated in any of Epstein's crimes, and she encouraged him to sue The Wall Street Journal after it wrote about a bawdy letter reportedly from Trump that was found among Epstein's possessions.) The president remains a strong supporter of Kennedy, who endorsed Trump last year after the president agreed to adopt much of his health agenda. (Their agreement was the result of “extortion” on the part of Kennedy, Loomer argues.) The White House leadership is counting on the Make America Healthy Again coalition to help Republicans in the midterm elections. Trump also called Loomer and dressed her down after she criticized his decision to allow the Air Force to accept a commercial plane from the Qatari government. “I want to apologize to President Trump more than anyone because I am a loyal person,” she later posted.

The most jarring Loomer crusades challenge the central assumptions of the national project. On August 8, the U.S. Army retold the heroic story of Captain Florent Groberg, a Medal of Honor winner who had tackled a suicide bomber 12 years earlier in Afghanistan, saving the lives of other Americans while sustaining serious injuries to his brain, leg, and, ear. Loomer pounced, denouncing the Army secretary for praising someone like Groberg, who was born in France and had given a speech supporting the presidential nominee Hillary Clinton at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.

“Are we supposed to believe the Army couldn't find a Republican and US born soldier?” she wrote on X. “They had to find an immigrant who voted for Hillary Clinton and spoke at the DNC as Obama's guest?” The claim that foreign-born patriots are less worthy of praise than those who are native-born won Loomer articles in The Washington Post, the Daily Mail, and other publications, but no comment from the White House.

Among those who objected was Greene, the Trump-aligned representative from Georgia who has tangled with Loomer—and has directed her own opposition research. “Many people need to wake up about her reporting. Researching facts and then spinning them into lies to serve her agenda doesn't make her good or trustworthy. It makes her a liar and it makes her dangerous,” Greene concluded in her own social-media post.

This, for Loomer, was an opportunity. She has no problem going after Republican targets. She has publicly accused Senator Lindsey Graham of being gay, which he denies, and called the podcaster Tucker Carlson a “fraud” and a “terrible person.” Loomer let loose on Greene, claiming without evidence that she committed obscene acts in CrossFit gyms. (She did link to a Daily Mail article that had suggested, based on anonymous sources, that the congresswoman had extramarital affairs with people she knew through her gym.)

“Can you call yourself a Christian when your mouth is full of other men's cock?” read one Loomer zinger, a modern version of the archetypical prompt “When did you stop beating your wife?”

All of it generated headlines, attention, and reposts of her social-media accounts. In a world without gatekeepers, where the most powerful man in the country rewards such behavior, Loomer sees little downside. Out-of-bounds provocation drives attention. Attention increases influence. And the person who matters the most is almost certainly entertained.

“At the end of the day, it is called the Trump administration,” she told me on our phone call. “So the way I look at it, I play for an audience of one.”

More specifically, nobody tells you how hard it is to keep up with the logistical demands and bureaucratic bloat. If deciding what to eat for dinner was annoying before children, try meal planning for a week with a family. There are chores to do, school emails to answer, trips to plan, bills to pay, and only so many minutes in the day.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

Running a family has become akin to running a small business for many Americans. So it's no surprise that a cottage industry has cropped up to support those fledgling families using a range of tools borrowed from work culture. Offering everything from AI-powered assistants to wall-mounted touchscreens, these tech companies promise to provide your family with its own command center or operating system — a software-based solution to the societal problem of parenting while overwhelmed.

The need for such a fix has cropped up as the demands of parenting have escalated. A 2025 report from the Office of the Surgeon General showed that nearly half of American parents said that “most days their stress is completely overwhelming.” Women tend to carry more of the mental load. The vast majority of parents in opposite-sex households say the mother spends more time managing schedules, according to a Pew Research Center poll published in 2023. A separate study found that mothers, on average, did 71 percent of the cognitive labor at home — child care, cleaning, scheduling, finances, managing relationships — while men did just 29 percent.

It's no surprise that a cottage industry has cropped up to support those fledgling families using a range of tools borrowed from work culture.

“This work of organizing the family is work, and it's falling on women, particularly in different-sex couples,” said Allison Daminger, an assistant sociology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and author of the upcoming book What's on Her Mind: The Mental Load of Family Life.

There's no relief in sight for most families. The cost of child care has steadily increased in recent years, and most working parents do not have access to paid family leave. An app won't solve these policy challenges, but it might make a tired parent's day slightly more streamlined.

“We have some of the most family hostile public policies and workplace practices of any high-income country, and parents are absolutely strapped for time and money,” said Brigid Schulte, director of the Better Life Lab at New America and author of Overwhelmed: Work, Love, and Play When No One Has the Time.

“Are these apps the answer? No, they're not,” Schulte told me. “At most they're Band-Aids. They can help people manage, keep their heads above water, but the real solutions we need are much bigger than any app.”

That was my experience trying out many of these new tools. The touchscreen in my kitchen is not paying for pre-school. However, I'm in no position to run for Congress and champion the cause, because I still have to make a pediatrician appointment, schedule a playdate, and plan the next week's worth of family meals.

My child is not yet 2, but my wife and I already feel the strain of administrative overload. And we learned the hard way that just creating a new Google Calendar wasn't going to cut it, where family obligations get mixed in with work meetings and personal to-dos, turning the whole thing into a soup of confusion.

That led me to check out dedicated family calendar apps, like Maple, before exploring full fledged family command centers, like Skylight.

The idea of using software to help families stay organized is not new. Some 20 years ago, a couple of former Microsoft employees created an online family organizer called Cozi, which is still around today. It wasn't until the pandemic that the concept really took off, though.

I'm in no position to run for Congress and champion the cause, because I still have to make a pediatrician appointment, schedule a playdate, and plan the next week's worth of family meals.

Skylight, makers of the touchscreen in my kitchen, started out as a digital picture frame company over a decade ago. In September 2020, the company made a meaningful pivot toward building a family command center with the launch of the Skylight Calendar, which syncs with existing digital calendars, like Google Calendar and Outlook, but puts the entire family on one screen. There are also tabs for a to-do list, a grocery list, and a meal plan, all of which are also available on a mobile app. Skylight has since added features, like a gamified chores tab for kids, and an AI assistant called Sidekick that converts emails and even pictures of things like fliers and recipes into calendar events and meal plans. The 27-inch Cal Max, launched last year, costs up to $600, plus an additional $80 a year for access to all the features.

Hot on Skylight's heels is an app called Maple, which launched in February 2021. Initially described as “the back office of every family,” Maple has gone through a few iterations, including one that enabled parents to sell “ready made plans” to other families, but the app is primarily a family calendar powered by to-do lists. You can create to-dos, assign them to members of the family, and then see a schedule of everything that needs to be done. There's also a meal planner, a family messaging platform, and a project management feature that's surprisingly good at planning birthday parties. It costs $40 a year to sync external calendars, get rid of ads, and access AI features.

I know what you're thinking: Google and Apple software can do a lot of this stuff for free. And you'd be right. There's no need to pay for a dedicated family calendar app, if you want to bootstrap existing software, including what you use for work, to stay organized.

Tech-savvy parents have been doing this for years. In 2016, a dad in Sweden went semi-viral for blogging about using Slack to keep track of his family and helped inspire The Atlantic story, “The Slackification of the American home.” Emily Oster, the economist turned parenting guru, canonized the concept in The Family Firm, a book about using off-the-shelf enterprise software like Asana to keep her family organized a few years ago. Just last year, the New York Times spoke to a number of parents, many of whom worked in the venture capital or crypto industries, that use project management tools like Trello and Notion to run their families like startups.

“Tasks and chores, to-do lists, grocery lists: There are apps that do those individual things better than we do,” Michael Segal, co-founder and CEO of Skylight, said in an interview. “It's just more convenient to do it all in the place where you go to manage the family and home.”

Michael Perry, Maple's co-founder and CEO, similarly told me that his company's job is “building a calendar that's all encompassing for seven days a week of our life as a working parent.” Maple also invites its users to join a Slack community, where they can weigh in on features they love or hate or check out upcoming releases, like Maple's new web app, which is set to launch this fall.

Skylight and Maple are the two family assistants I've used the most, but they're hardly the only ones. Hearth sells its own giant touchscreen calendar for your kitchen, and Jam looks like a Maple clone with some Gen Z design flair. Apps like Milo and Ohai lean into the AI of it all, promising to use chatbots to keep your family organized. There are also tech companies trying to connect parents. Honeycomb says it helps parents “share the mental and logistical load” via group chats and smart calendars, and the Sandwich Club is an AI-powered advice platform that lets other parents weigh in on your questions.

Together, these companies comprise a burgeoning new industry, referred to as famtech. There's even an industry association dedicated to promoting its interests, drumming up investment, and pushing for policy changes for caregivers, like paid family leave. “Liken it to where financial services has fintech, we look at the care economy as having famtech as its innovation sector,” said Anna Steffany, executive director of FamTech.org, “and we look at family technology as all things addressing the caregiving space.” One trend report, which Steffany contributed to, values the care economy at nearly $650 billion.

It's easy to feel skeptical about a single app or kitchen-based touchscreen that promises to make parents' lives easier. Heck, I've been using both for a few weeks now, and it's certainly nice not to have to text my wife every time there's a change in the schedule or to remind me who's on preschool pickup duty that day.

Then again, I'm also starting to wonder if using a parenting app just means I'm giving up more data about my family in the services of better targeted ads. (The privacy policies of both Maple and Skylight say the companies may collect and share personal data with third parties.) I'm also acutely aware that having a new tool to manage my family means I've got yet another thing to manage.

“When you're trying to integrate across so many different apps and systems and interfaces, the real cost benefit ratio can get thrown off,” said Daminger, the UW-Madison professor. “Sometimes we're trying to make things easier, but in the end, we actually end up just creating new forms of labor.”

This story originally appeared in Kids Today, Vox's newsletter about kids, for everyone. Sign up here for future editions.

As long as youth culture has existed, adults have been mystified, perplexed, and even threatened by it. At least once a week I think about the scene in A Hard Day's Night, a film released in 1964, in which the Beatles are being interviewed by clueless older journalists. (“What would you call that hairstyle you're wearing?” “Arthur.”)

But even seen against the long history of grown-ups not getting it, the culture of Gen Alpha — kids born between about 2010 and 2024 — feels especially hard to pin down. It is famously fragmentary — the monoculture is dead, and if adults aren't all watching the same shows anymore, a lot of kids aren't even watching shows. They're watching short-form video on their phones, sources of entertainment (or personality erosion) so limitless that every kid in the world could, in theory, be consuming a different piece of content right now.

Given all this, every time I hear a claim like “Gen Alpha doesn't laugh at farts,” I'm tempted to ask whether Gen Alpha collectively laughs at — or cries over, or has any sort of aesthetic experience with — anything. Is there a mass culture for kids and teens today? And if so, where does it come from, and what does it look like?

A newsletter about kids — for everyone, from senior correspondent Anna North.

When I posed these questions to people who study kids and culture, the answer I got was that while young people probably aren't watching the same things, a lot of them are craving similar experiences from the culture they consume, whether it's movies, YouTube, or, increasingly, video games.

They want to feel safe, they want a sense of community, and they really, really want adults to leave them alone.

Kids “are still participating in culture,” said BJ Colangelo, a media theorist and analyst who has spoken about Gen Alpha trends. “They just are making their own, and they're choosing not to share it with the rest of us.”

Young people have never enjoyed being told what to like, and there's always been something organic and chaotic about their engagement with pop culture. At the same time, previous generations did have cultural arbiters and gatekeepers who controlled, to some degree, what they could access.

For millennials and Gen Xers, “magazines, MTV, and the radio were major outlets that were promoting and selling us what ‘cool' is,” Colangelo told me. Young people could accept or reject what they were offered, “but even with that choice, it was still being curated by editors, producers, DJs.” That was also true of culture aimed at younger kids, whose options were circumscribed by conglomerates like Nickelodeon and Disney.

Parents also had a lot of involvement in — and veto power over — what kids watched. Your whole family could see what you watched on the TV in the living room, and parents could ban, or at least sneer with disapproval at, shows they found unwholesome. (I can't be the only millennial who looked forward to sleepovers as a time to watch R-rated movies after the grown-ups went to bed.)

Today, media companies still try to manufacture hits, and sometimes they succeed. But kids no longer need to go through those companies to get their entertainment. And while parents can set screen time limits and put controls on children's phones or iPads, kids are notoriously great at getting around them.

The result is a cultural landscape dominated by social media, one in which nearly half of younger kids' viewing time takes place on YouTube, TikTok, or other social platforms. You could certainly think of social media trends as shared cultural experiences within that landscape — indeed, many of the touchstones of youth culture that have received mainstream media coverage in recent years have been trends that managed to spill over into offline life, like the phenomenon of young people wearing suits to the film Minions: The Rise of Gru (incidentally, this trend appears to have been promoted by Universal Pictures, the studio that distributed Minions).

Trends can be shared cultural experiences like the popular shows or movies of previous generations. The difference is that there are so many of them, and they pop up and flame out so quickly, said Jenna Jacobson, an associate professor of retailing at Toronto Metropolitan University who studies social media. “Young people are experiencing a series of these micro mass events, which could be a sound or a meme, or a particular brand.”

At the same time, “social media allows many micro-communities to exist, which means that not everybody is seeing the same thing at the same time” — until something becomes big enough that it permeates everyone's feed, Jacobson said.

Some of those big trends come from movies like Minions or Barbie, but a lot of them come from video games. It's no accident that A Minecraft Movie, one of the most popular films with Gen Alpha to date, is based on a massively popular game.

In a survey of 10- to 24-year-olds last year by the Center for Scholars & Storytellers at UCLA, only 12 percent reported not playing games. “More than a lot of things, it is a unifying culture,” Yalda T. Uhls, founder and CEO of the center, told me. “When my kid, at 21, was hanging out with a 6-year-old, they were playing Minecraft together.”

Young people today crave a sense of connection, Uhls said: “In a world where kids are not allowed to run outside, there aren't as many spaces for them, or they're overscheduled, gaming is a place they can gather.”

It's no surprise that a generation of kids who spent formative years in lockdowns and remote school would feel starved for community. To me, another desire was more striking: The top goal for Gen Alpha and Gen Z, according to research by the Center for Scholars & Storytellers, is to feel safe.

But if part of what kids want is to be safe from us, maybe we need to pay attention to that.

This took me aback a little because a lot of what I think of as archetypal Gen Alpha content — Skibidi toilet, for example — can feel jarring, choppy, and a little scary. But Uhls points out that young people in 2025 are facing down climate disaster, rampant inequality, and active shooter drills at their schools. For them, gaming, and media in general, can be a source of comfort.

And kids don't just want to be safe from the very real threats to their lives and livelihoods, Colangelo told me. They also want to be safe from the constant evaluation and judgment of adults.

Gen Alpha “has come of age in the social media surveillance state that we are all suffering under,” Colangelo said. “So many of them already have a digital footprint that they never consented to because their parents posted them online when they were babies.”

They're drawn especially to sandbox games and open-world games like Roblox and Minecraft because those games allow them to “make their own realities and mini games and communities away from the watchful eye of Big Brother,” Colangelo said. “It allows them to have something that they are in complete control over.”

A Minecraft Movie was such a success not just because it was based on a game, but because it was truly for kids, not for their parents. “So much of the mainstream culture right now is based on nostalgia,” Colangelo said. “It's stuff their parents, their siblings, or even their grandparents like. Minecraft is very much their thing.”

Adults often deride young people today for craving safe spaces, being afraid of anything new, different, or difficult. But if part of what kids want is to be safe from us, maybe we need to pay attention to that.

I don't want to be too much of a Pollyanna — kids, like adults, are certainly capable of wasting time watching AI slop or its equivalent (don't ask me about the video my kid loves in which a toddler is inexplicably stung by a caterpillar). It's also the case that if kids are spending all their time within their microcommunities or on their highly-curated feeds, they're less likely to discover new artists or ideas, Colangelo pointed out.

At the same time, a lot of kids' media habits can be understood as bids for autonomy, Colangelo said. They're really “against things that are being force fed to them.”

That's scary for adults who, sometimes understandably, want some say over what kids see and hear and play. But it's also a message about what we've taken away from a generation of kids, and what we might need to give back.

The Department of Health and Human Services has said that its upcoming second MAHA report will include solutions for improving kids' health. But a draft report obtained by the New York Times does not include restrictions on pesticides, which experts say are necessary to reverse the increase in children's chronic disease.

Oklahoma will require teachers from California and New York (and only those two states) to take a certification test showing they know “the biological differences between females and males,” among other topics, before they can teach in Oklahoma. (The state's superintendent of schools previously announced that all teachers would need to incorporate the Bible into curricula.)

Wired asked a group of kids what they think of AI. My favorite is Leo Schodorf, who tries to be polite to ChatGPT because, “if they take over the world, and they're destroying everyone, then maybe they'll be like, this guy says please and thank you.”My little kid has been enjoying Zog, about a dragon who becomes an ambulance, kind of.

The wonky math of “meat offsets,” explained.

Earlier this month, a fundraiser for nonprofits that fight to end factory farming went a little viral — at least in one corner of the internet.

Dwarkesh Patel, the influential tech podcaster, announced on his show that if his listeners donated a collective $250,000 to FarmKind, an organization that distributes money to anti-factory farming charities, so would he. They did — and then some.

So far, Patel and his listeners — including Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, professional poker player Liv Boeree, and popular Substack writer Noah Smith — have raised over $2 million. For the global anti-factory farming movement, which works on a shoestring budget to fix one of the most challenging and neglected social issues of our time, that's a lot of money.

The movement spent around $260 million last year in its effort to help tens of billions of abused land animals and a trillion or so fish (to put that into perspective, New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art spends far more annually to collect, store, and display art). So, Patel helped raise the equivalent of almost 1 percent of the entire global movement's yearly budget.

His pitch was simple: This is a really big problem, and charities have been able to make meaningful progress on it with little money, so by injecting even a relatively modest amount of extra funds into the cause, you can make a big difference. The organization that will distribute the money, FarmKind, makes the same pitch, but with a twist that Patel only hinted at: If you feel bad about eating meat but don't want to go vegan, you can have the same impact by donating to charity instead.

“It's like carbon offsets, but for your diet,” FarmKind's website states. (Carbon offsets allow people to pay for an environmental good — like planting trees that absorb carbon dioxide — to offset a high carbon-emitting activity, like traveling by airplane.)

The concept makes intuitive sense. Most people think the factory farms that produce the vast majority of America's meat, eggs, and dairy are bad, but decades of vegan advocacy have failed to persuade more than 1 percent of Americans. Calls to just eat less meat have proven largely ineffective, too. If sympathetic consumers are unwilling to change their diets, the thinking goes, they could still help by supporting cash-strapped organizations working to reduce animal suffering on farms and make plant-based eating more accessible.

But I also worry that FarmKind's approach, known as “moral offsetting,” might absolve consumers — who individually and collectively hold power to reduce the number of animals factory-farmed for food — of personal responsibility.

So, can you actually offset your meat consumption with a donation? And more importantly, should you?

Each year, the average American eats around 33 chickens, eight fish, 228 shrimp, one-third of a pig, and a tenth of a cow — for a total of 269.5 animals. According to FarmKind, it'll cost you $23 a month to offset the suffering those animals experience on factory farms.

That's about “the cost of a monthly Netflix premium subscription,” Thom Norman, FarmKind's co-founder and director of outreach, told me.

This doesn't mean that if you donate $23 per month, you save 269.5 animals or guarantee that someone else will go vegetarian in your stead. Rather, FarmKind estimates that, with an extra $23 per month, the animal advocacy charities that receive your money can reduce animal suffering by an amount equivalent to the suffering experienced by 269.5 animals on factory farms.

Take egg-laying hens, for example. More than half of egg-laying hens in the US are indefinitely confined in tiny cages, a practice that represents some of the worst animal cruelty in our food system. Animal advocacy groups have successfully pressured hundreds of corporations, along with many state governments, to ban these cages. One of the leading cage-free advocacy groups, the Humane League, estimates that for every 85 cents they spend on these campaigns, they manage to get one hen out of a cage.

Animal welfare experts have estimated that one-third of an egg-laying hen's total suffering can be attributed to their confinement in cages. With this in mind, getting three hens out of cages — which would cost the Humane League $2.55 — is, according to FarmKind, the equivalent of ending the suffering of one factory-farmed hen.

FarmKind uses similar analyses that attempt to quantify the suffering of pigs kept in tiny cages, and the suffering inflicted by other cruel practices on factory farms.

The organization acknowledges that there's a degree of uncertainty in these calculations, and it uses more conservative estimates to account for it. For example, it's hard to estimate the degree to which nonprofits that work to make plant-based eating more accessible translates to less animal suffering in the long run.

And there are more fundamentally unknowable questions — like, given that we don't know what it's like to be a chicken, do we really know that cage confinement accounts for one-third of a hen's suffering? There are more practical unknowns, too, like whether a charity that has been effective in the past will be effective in the future — after years of success, their campaigns may hit diminishing returns.

It's easy to dismiss these uncertainties as misleading, and I could further quibble with FarmKind's calculations. But what is clear is that the resource-poor anti-factory farming movement could make a lot more progress with more money, whether it's labeled an “offset” or not.

Still, there's the thornier question as to whether a social movement should encourage people to donate to offset the harm they're causing, rather than to stop participating in it directly.

FarmKind's answer to that question is an unequivocal “yes,” and it's one rooted in ruthless pragmatism.

“We know that people overall are actually really on board with the idea that factory farming in particular is terrible,” Norman of FarmKind told me. And animal advocacy groups tend to give consumers one thing they can do to help: reduce or eliminate their meat consumption.

It hasn't worked. In the US, rates of vegetarianism have stagnated. And while many people say they're actively reducing their meat intake, most are probably lying or fooling themselves. American per capita meat consumption has increased in recent years.

In a better world, it would be easier to persuade people to change their diets. But in the world we've got, the next best thing, according to Norman, is to enrich the animal advocacy movement so that it can win more campaigns to reduce animal suffering on factory farms.

As to whether meat offsets let people off the hook, morally speaking, Norman said he's uncertain. He doesn't know whether donating might make people who otherwise would've reduced their meat consumption refrain from doing so or even increase their consumption. But he says that people donating to FarmKind aren't deciding between going vegan or donating to offset their meat consumption. “Typically, they're thinking, ‘Should I offset or should I do nothing?'” Norman said Plus, he added, getting people to donate as a first step might make them feel a part of the movement and lead them to take other actions, like eating less meat or volunteering.

I posed the question of offsets to Tyler John, a philosopher and philanthropic advisor who's thought deeply about animal ethics, philanthropy, and carbon offsetting. John is sympathetic to FarmKind's strategy and agrees that the animal advocacy movement needs to give the public more options to participate beyond just changing their diets, and that donating to the cause should be one of them. But whether or not that can truly offset an individual's meat consumption, he said, is “a very complicated empirical question.”

He worries that the idea of meat offsets could further reinforce how little humans value the lives of animals raised and slaughtered for food. Few people would consider it morally sound to abuse a dog and offset that harm by donating to an animal shelter, but this is essentially what meat offsetting entails.

“In cases where we're morally outraged, we don't think that offsetting can wipe away the problem,” John said. “It's only in cases where we're morally disengaged and don't care that much about the moral issue that we think offsetting is okay.”

We also can't “offset our way out” of the factory farming problem, John said, because even if everyone were to offset their meat consumption, the meat industry would still raise and slaughter tens of billions of animals — albeit in modestly better conditions — every year.

When I first learned about FarmKind, I instinctively winced at the idea that the suffering of farmed animals could be offset with a donation equivalent to a monthly Netflix subscription. I still wince at it when I think about the nature of that suffering. Billions of animals are trapped in cages — their tails, testicles, and beaks cut off with no pain relief — and overcrowded into noxious warehouses, forced to live in their own waste. I think that should be met with a bigger response than parting with $23 per month.

But, then, I think about how the project to end factory farming, drastically reduce meat consumption, and shift the world toward a more plant-based food system will likely be a centuries-long one, and I can see meat offsets in another light.

We're only about 50 years into the modern animal rights movement, and the current political, economic, and social conditions are such that the movement's primary goals are still far out of reach. What is in reach is reducing the suffering of animals unlucky enough to be born into the factory farm system and slowly normalizing plant-based eating. But those can only be achieved by a bigger, better resourced, more powerful animal advocacy movement. A sympathetic public could, at the very least, chip in to build that movement, and the success of Dwarkesh Patel's fundraiser suggests there are a lot of people eager to help in this way.

I don't know if you can truly offset the suffering and death of one animal on a factory farm by making many others suffer a little less. But I know that to be an advocate for animals in 2025, you have to accept that most people agree that factory farming is terrible but are unwilling to do what is needed to end it. You then have to meet them where they are, which is painfully far from what animals need.

A few years ago, carbon offset expert John Holler told Vox that it's more helpful to think of carbon offsets as simply “a tool for routing money toward good things,” like green energy and forest conservation, rather than as a true offset of your own carbon footprint.

“You're purchasing carbon credits to contribute to global decarbonization,” he said, “not making a claim against your own emissions.” We should think about meat offsets in the same way. They don't — and can't — absolve humanity of its abuse of billions of animals, but they do help to build a better world that many of us want to see but can't yet bring ourselves to realize.

The comedy forecast is bleak — but not as bleak as Marc Maron says it is.

“I think if Hitler were alive today, he'd probably appear on Theo Von's podcast,” Marc Maron jokes toward the end of his new HBO special, Panicked. He then proceeds to imitate a half-baked, drawling Von, archbishop of the dudebro podcaster, softballing questions about drug use to a hypothetical Hitler. “On our podcast,” he snarks in an earlier moment, “we can bravely speak power to truth, now that truth can no longer defend itself.”

When Marc Maron announced he was ending his longrunning, highly influential interview show WTF with Marc Maron, it might have seemed surprising that the comic was giving up his hard-won platform. But while the podcast's relevance had faded, a recent take-no-prisoners press tour raised Maron's profile again. In something like a political and cultural crusade, Maron has been explicitly calling out comedians, from stand-up comics to podcast bros, for ushering in the current era of fascism.

“Under the umbrella of ‘anti-woke,' we've lost a tremendous amount of democratic-leaning ideas and movements,” he told a visibly displeased Howie Mandel on his YouTube podcast Howie Mandel Does Stuff. Mandel countered that comedians didn't have that much power.

“Are you fucking out of your mind?” Maron shot back.

Maron continually insists that comedy drives politics, and that the current long era of “anti-woke” comedy has actively helped shift political tides to the far right. In his view, comedians and podcasters aren't just straying from their lanes. They're dumbing down and overtaking comedy itself — and that comedy is then shifting our cultural norms into something ugly and dangerous.

Maron's focus is clearly on larger cultural shifts. But it's also worth asking: is he right about the state of comedy?

Like many of the current biggest names in podcasting, Marc Maron's career begins and ends in stand-up work. After watching the ascent of colleagues in the East Village alt scene like Louis C.K. and Sarah Silverman, he became a regular on the left-leaning Air America radio network, which launched in 2004 as a counterbalance to conservative talk radio of the era. While Air America ultimately floundered, Maron used his built-in leftist network audience to kickstart a pivot into what was then the niche arena of podcasting.

When WTF started in 2009, it was the first major interview podcast on the scene; The Joe Rogan Experience began just three months later. Although it took a while for podcasting on the whole to become the ubiquitous phenomenon it is today, Maron himself quickly gained a reputation as a surprisingly intimate interviewer, praised both for having a wide range of guests and for extracting, both from them and from himself, rare levels of emotional honesty.

While Maron never exactly shied away from political topics when they came up — the comic Gallagher walked out of Maron's garage studio when Maron confronted him about making racist and homophobic jokes — he consciously avoided making his show a political show. Still, over the years, as politics subsumed American culture, Maron himself became more and more fed up, largely with his fellow comedians.

Following comedian Tony Hinchcliffe's disastrous appearance at the 2024 Republican National Convention, where he spewed a litany of racist, misogynistic, and homophobic jokes, Maron made a lengthy blog post on his own website. In it, he condemned “the combination of blatant racist fear mongering and the anti-woke movement” that far-right leaders were using to gain cultural and political power.

“The anti-woke flank of the new fascism is being driven almost exclusively by comics, my peers,” he wrote. “When comedians with podcasts have shameless, self-proclaimed white supremacists and fascists on their show to joke around like they are just entertainers or even just politicians, all it does is humanize and normalize fascism. When someone uses their platform for that reason they are facilitating anti-American sentiment and promoting violent autocracy.”

Popular podcasts, he wrote, “may be in the position to become part of the media oligarchy under the new anti-democratic government.” Maron was clearly responding to the role podcasters like Von — and their casual, jocular sitdowns with Trump and his allies — were already playing in the lead-up to the 2024 election.

All of this makes the timing of Maron's decision to quit his own podcast seem significant, especially when combined with his subsequent recrimination tour. “We're burnt out,” he told his audience in June when he broke the news that WTF would be ending. But if Maron was exhausted by the daily grind of podcast production, he's clearly still invested in the state of comedy.

And he hasn't stopped talking about his disenchantment with it since.

At the bullseye of Maron's comedy dartboard sits Joe Rogan. Though the two men ascended in tandem as reigning kings of podcasting, ideologically they occupy very different spaces. (It's worth noting that Rogan and Maron have each been guests on one another's shows in the past — though not lately.)

In recent months, Maron has repeatedly called out Rogan's cultural influence, criticizing him and his podcasting community not only for platforming extremism, but for dumbing down the standards for “good” comedy.

To Mandel and his co-host Jackelyn Shultz, Maron suggested that, previously, comedians “could disarm fears, they could elevate your perception of things,” he said. “They had the power through humor to make you see the world differently.”

He contrasts that to “hackneyed” jokes about trans people and other topics that stand-up comics canvass purely for shock value. By normalizing comedy's one “don't” — punching down — Rogan and his fellows have, per Maron, whitewashed bullying and attacking marginalized groups who then become the real-world targets of discrimination and legalized persecution. The culture of shit-talking is “nothing but destructive,” he told Mandel.

And it's worse than mean, it's hack comedy. A hack isn't just someone who tries to shock you; the hack is someone who can't shock you, because you already know exactly where the joke is going to go. Hack comedy becomes its own dead end. On a recent episode of Bad Friends, Maron made this point bluntly about Rogan and the Austin comedy scene over which he presides. At some point, Maron observed, after you've punched down so often, there's nothing left to punch down against.

It's an interesting way to approach the conversation. While Maron is open about the political ramifications of this kind of comedy, making his complaints about comedy craft allows him to avoid engaging in debates about the ideology behind this kind of rhetoric.

Where he does get more explicitly political is in dissecting the “anti-woke” discourse itself. Citing the army of comedians from Rogan to Dave Chappelle who have lined up in recent years to decry cancel culture as an attack on free speech, Maron argues that the widespread comedy debate over this was a misdirect from the issues people really needed to be alarmed about.

“It wasn't a free speech problem,” he told Mandel. “It was that people were getting cultural pushback.”

Maron has felt plenty of pushback himself, both over the aforementioned Theo Von joke and because of his comments about Rogan, which led to what some fans have called “a meltdown” in the comedy community. Maron was quick to point out the irony.

“I do think on some level that if [the anti-woke comedians are] all about free speech, and they have a sense of humor, and you're supposed to be able to man up and take it, then if it's funny, fuck it,” he told The Endless Honeymoon Podcast.

One of Maron's recurring complaints is a common one: Podcasting, once praised as a democratized space, has now become too democratized.

To Mandel, Maron griped that the podcasting world has “obviously become oversaturated, and nobody ever shuts up.” The death of the monoculture and the oversaturation of podcasts about every conceivable topic, from every conceivable influencer, now leads to content that “means nothing.” While the explosion in podcasts has led to more freedom for more people, “that doesn't mean that that's a good thing,” he told the hosts.

Even more destructive? The algorithm.

“There are comics doing a minute of crowd work,” Maron pointed out, referring to the recent trend of stand-ups — think Matt Rife — looking to go viral through short, TikTok-ready moments. “Chasing these clicks with no craft, no sense of originality, because all they care about is this immediate sense of relevance.”

Maron laments the careers of comedians like Maria Bamford, who he recently asserted might be one of the greatest comics ever on Vulture's Good One podcast. But he framed that conversation as being less about Bamford and more about “tribalized” comic fans — the Roganites — who are too small-minded to get her comedy.

So, if Maron sees podcasting as the haven of comedy and comedy as leaning worryingly toward sameness, why exactly is he giving up his own platform that he refers to as “for sensitive, creative people?” By setting himself and Rogan up with an either/or dichotomy, he plays into the false idea that without WTF, the Roganverse will be the only thing left. It's a limited view of the podcasting space, but it does fit Maron's whole doom-and-gloom vibe.

“You do realize we annoyed the average American into fascism,” he tells his audience in Panicked, looking to share the blame. He refers to progressives as “buzzkills.” He knows that a dim view of absolutely everything necessarily has its limitations. That's true even when it comes to comedy.

While he's spent most of this press tour railing about the Rogansphere, he's also sidestepped talking about the hugely popular comedy podcasts — heavy hitters like Las Culturistas and Good Hang With Amy Poehler, as well as up-and-coming shows like Caleb Hearon's So True —  that would never claim to be anti-woke. He doesn't seem to be taking into account the litany of comedians whose recent specials explore a broad range of comedic storytelling and structure — exactly the kinds of things Maron says he's missing. There are plenty of funny people out there who have never claimed to be free speech warriors; who are interested in the craft and future of being funny in public.

Maron's aware of these entities. He recently appeared on Conan O'Brien's mega-popular podcast Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend — an avowedly apolitical show that happens to have featured Michelle Obama three times — and had Las Culturistas co-host Bowen Yang on one of the final episodes of his own show.

He's also not wrong that there has been a serious shift in the comedy world, with a rise in pandering, bro-y comedy after nearly two decades in which the alt scene paradoxically reigned. A sign that says “THE END IS NEAR” gets a lot more focus and attention than one that says, “Complicated and unsettling shifts in American thought are being actively reflected in my sector of the entertainment-industrial complex, and that worries me!”

Doom and gloom has its place, especially these days, but there is still some light to be found in comedy.

A New York state appeals court on Thursday threw out a more than $500 million civil business fraud penalty imposed on President Donald Trump and other defendants in connection with a lawsuit by state Attorney General Letitia James.

The appeals court said that the penalty, ""which directs that defendants pay nearly half a billion dollars to the State of New York, is an excessive fine that violates the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution.""

However, the court in the same ruling said that other non-monetary sanctions imposed by a Manhattan Supreme Court judge on Trump, the Trump Organization, and other defendants were ""well crafted to curb defendants' business culture.""

The ruling, which James said she would appeal to the state's highest court, was issued by the First Judicial Department of the Appellate Division of New York Supreme Court.

In a concurring opinion with the decision, Judge Peter Moulton wrote that James ""did not carry her initial burden"" of establishing the rough total of the profits ""causally connected"" to the defendants' violations.

""Indeed, the calculation of the disgorgement in this case was far from a reasonable approximation,"" Moulton wrote.

Trump crowed about the ruling in a post on Truth Social.

""TOTAL VICTORY in the FAKE New York State Attorney General Letitia James Case!""  Trump wrote.

""I greatly respect the fact that the Court had the Courage to throw out this unlawful and disgraceful Decision that was hurting Business all throughout New York State,"" the president said. 

""Others were afraid to do business there. The amount, including Interest and Penalties, was over $550 Million Dollars. It was a Political Witch Hunt, in a business sense, the likes of which no one has ever seen before.""

Eric Trump, the president's son, and one of the defendants in the lawsuit, in a social media post, wrote, ""Total victory in the sham NY Attorney General case!!! After 5 years of hell, justice prevailed!"" 

Eric Trump, with his brother Donald Trump Jr., operates the Trump Organization.

James, in a statement, said she would ask the New York Court of Appeals to overturn the ruling tossing out the fine on Trump and the others.

James also said, ""The First Department today affirmed the well-supported finding of the trial court: Donald Trump, his company, and two of his children are liable for fraud. ""The court upheld the injunctive relief we won, limiting Donald Trump and the Trump Organization officers' ability to do business in New York,"" James said.

""It should not be lost to history: yet another court has ruled that the president violated the law, and that our case has merit.""

Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron in February 2024 ordered Trump to pay around $454 million in total penalties after holding him liable for business fraud.

Engoron found that Trump's statements of financial condition, signed between 2014 and 2021, overvalued his assets from between $812 million and $2.2 billion.

With interest, the penalty imposed on Trump and other defendants in the case has grown to more than $500 million.

In this article

Two top House Democrats are investigating whether Paramount and Skydance Media acquiesced to ""illegitimate demands"" from President Donald Trump in order to win approval for their $8 billion merger.

""Two wrongs do not make a right,"" Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Frank Pallone of New Jersey wrote to David Ellison, CEO of the newly formed Paramount Skydance Corporation, in a letter obtained by CNBC.

""Illegitimate demands from the [Federal Communications Commission] or the Administration do not absolve your company from wrongdoing,"" wrote Raskin and Pallone, the top Democrats on the House Judiciary and Energy committees, respectively.

The FCC blessed the merger in late July, less than a month after Paramount agreed to a $16 million settlement to end Trump's lawsuit against its subsidiary CBS News over a snippet of a ""60 Minutes"" interview. The president had claimed the interview was deceptively edited to boost his then-campaign rival, Kamala Harris.

The lawsuit was widely criticized as meritless, including by Paramount, which maintained that the show followed a standard editing process.

""The settlement raises significant concerns that Donald Trump demanded and Paramount paid an illegal bribe—a $16 million payment to the President in exchange for merger approval from the FCC,"" the lawmakers' letter read.

""For both Paramount and Skydance to acquiesce to President Trump's meritless claims in order to consummate the merger demonstrates an extreme disregard to anything that might stand in the way of profit,"" they wrote.

Paramount Skydance did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the letter.

The letter, dated Wednesday, gives Paramount two weeks to answer questions and provide a slew of internal materials, including ""all related communications involving"" Trump, the White House, the FCC and the Trump Organization.

The lawmakers suggest that Paramount and Skydance, through their dealings with Trump, have violated anti-bribery and corruption clauses in the agreements they filed with the FCC.

Raskin and Pallone also noted that Trump, while boasting about the settlement, claimed he also expects to get another $20 million in ""Advertising, PSAs, or similar Programming"" from the ""new Owners.""

News outlets have reported that Skydance sources deny Trump's assertion. But the House Democrats cite reporting that indicates ""there is evidence that you had multiple conversations with the President leading up to the deal being approved by the FCC.""

The reported ""side deal"" with Trump ""was necessarily contingent on the FCC approving the deal and does not appear to present any legitimate value to the public, only to President Trump,"" they wrote.

""Therefore, this appears to be an offer of payment and benefits to a government official designed to achieve a specific outcome from the government—in other words, a bribe,"" the letter reads.

Raskin and Pallone also point to CBS' recent cancellation of ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" the tentpole talk show whose host, a vocal Trump critic, called Paramount's settlement a ""big fat bribe.""

And they note reporting that Skydance ""agreed to make changes to CBS and its editorial practices that align with the Trump Administration's political agenda"" as a condition of the merger.

That includes hiring an ombudsman ""to police the news organization's editorial choices,"" which the lawmakers called ""a poorly disguised attempt at censoring speech that contradicts the Administration's ideals.""

At the time the FCC approved the merger, Chairman Brendan Carr said in a statement that Skydance had made ""written commitments to ensure that the new company's programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum.""

Carr added that the approval of the merger marked a step forward in the FCC's efforts to eliminate DEI efforts.

The U.S. and European Union on Thursday revealed fresh details about their trade framework, including on hotly contested and anticipated pharma and semiconductor tariffs.

After weeks of heated negotiation, Brussels and Washington finally arrived at a trade agreement late last month, setting out 15% blanket tariffs on EU exports to the U.S. Under the deal, the EU also committed to purchase $750 billion worth of U.S. energy and invest at least an additional $600 billion in the U.S.

Many political and business leaders in Europe at the time expressed concerns about the deal being unbalanced. Several questions remained unanswered including on what tariff rate would apply to some goods U.S. President Donald Trump has hit with sectoral duties.

Thursday's announcement at last shed more details at a time when many other trading partners are still waiting, and negotiating, for similar clarity on their respective trade deals with the U.S.

Speaking to journalists on Thursday after the announcement, EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said that ""this is the most favorable trade deal the U.S. has extended to any partner.""

""But this is not the end. This is the beginning. This framework is the first step, one that can grow over time to cover more sectors, improve market access and strengthen our economic ties even further,"" he added.

Key points in the statement include the U.S. committing to ""apply the higher of either the U.S. Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff rate or a tariff rate of 15 percent, comprised of the MFN tariff and a reciprocal tariff, on originating goods of the European Union.""

As of Sept. 1, the U.S. will apply only MFN duties on several goods from the EU, including ""unavailable natural resources (including cork), all aircraft and aircraft parts, generic pharmaceuticals and their ingredients and chemical precursors.""

Several so-called Section 232 tariffs have been capped at the wider 15% tariff rate, including those on lumber, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, according to a senior U.S. administration official. This is sharply below the rates Trump has sometimes threatened, as well as a 100% levy on semiconductors.

Meanwhile, the statement noted that the EU intends to ""to eliminate tariffs on all U.S. industrial goods and to provide preferential market access for a wide range of U.S. seafood and agricultural goods."" This was already broadly covered in the initial framework.

The statement also included insights into the EU's energy purchasing and investment pledges, which previously raised questions about their feasibility and about potential repercussions if the commitments do not materialize.

The latest announcement reiterated figures for planned spending from the EU, including on artificial intelligence chips, energy and broader investments in the U.S., but described them as intended and expected, rather than as guaranteed commitments, a senior administration official pointed out.

Thursday's statement also noted plans for the EU to ""substantially"" increase its procurement of U.S. military and defense equipment, even as Europe has committed to growing its own defense capabilities.

Notably, the latest agreement does not introduce changes in terms of the EU's Digital Services Act, which includes regulations for big tech companies and has long been a point of contention in trade talks for Trump.

Sefcovic on Thursday noted that the digital sector had been kept out of trade talks.

He also addressed questions regarding the wine and spirits sector, which is not covered by the deal. The EU's trade commissioner suggested that, while it would not be easy to come to an agreement on this issue with Washington, ""these doors are not closed forever.""

Europe's pharmaceutical sector — the U.S.' top source for pharma imports — will also see tariffs capped at up to 15%. Critically, the rate will not stack on top of other EU-wide tariffs.

From Sept. 1, the Trump administration has also agreed to only apply its MFN drug pricing policy to generic pharmaceuticals. The directive aims to reduce U.S. drug prices by tying them to the typically lower prices paid by other developed nations.

Back in April, the Trump administration had launched a so-called Section 232 investigation on pharmaceutical products to examine the impact of imports on national security. In recent weeks, Trump threatened levies as high as 250% on the pharma sector and sent an ultimatum to major firms demanding that they lower U.S. drug prices.

The White House leader has long lambasted the sector over what he has dubbed ""abusive"" pricing practices, while simultaneously urging firms to move their manufacturing operations stateside in an effort to bolster domestic production.

That prompted a flurry of U.S. investment commitments over recent months, including from Novartis, AstraZeneca and Roche, as well as pricing adjustments from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly.

The U.S. and EU on Thursday said they had agreed to a conditional 15% tariff for European autos and auto parts bound for the U.S. — but only after Brussels introduces legislation to reduce their industrial duties, according to a senior administration official.

The official added that the mere introduction of EU legislation to reduce the rate of industrial tariffs would be enough to kick-start this trade-off.

""With respect to automobiles, the United States and the European Union intend to accept and provide mutual recognition to each other's standards,"" the U.S. and EU said in a joint statement published Thursday.

Under the terms of the trade framework struck in late July, the EU said it would eliminate the ""already low"" duties on industrial goods from the U.S.

Speaking late last month, Trump had hailed the initially disclosed framework agreement as the biggest trade deal ever made and one that promised to be ""great for cars.""

The prospect of a 15% tariff rate on autos and auto parts represents a substantial reduction from the U.S. president's threat to impose charges of 30%. It also nearly halves the existing tariff rate on Europe's auto sector from 27.5%.

Industry groups had previously expressed deep concern about the costs associated with the tariff reality.

The German Association of the Automotive Industry, or VDA, which represents more than 620 companies involved in the German auto sector, warned a U.S. tariff of 15% on auto products would ""cost German automotive companies billions annually and place a burden on them in the midst of their transformation.""

The Department of Justice will investigate Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook based on a criminal referral sent by a Trump administration housing official and arch critic of central bank chairman Jerome Powell, according to a letter obtained by CNBC's Sara Eisen on Thursday.

The letter, addressed to Powell and signed by Justice Department attorney Ed Martin, urges the Fed chair to fire Cook from the board in light of the allegations that have been lodged against her.

""Do it today before it is too late!"" Martin wrote.

But Powell does not have the authority to fire Cook: The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 states explicitly that board members can only be removed by the president.

Moreover, the Supreme Court suggested earlier this year that the president does not have the authority to arbitrarily remove Fed governors over policy disagreements.

The DOJ and the Fed declined CNBC's requests for comment on the letter.

Martin noted in his letter that he received a criminal referral about Cook, and that she has responded that she is gathering evidence in preparation for her response to the allegations. 

""It is a very troubling public interaction relating to her, I think you will agree,"" Martin wrote.

""At this time, I encourage you to remove Ms. Cook from your Board,"" he wrote. ""Do it today before it is too late! After all, no American thinks it is appropriate that she serve during this time with a cloud hanging over her.""

Martin added, ""As we begin any investigation of the conduct like that by Ms. Cook in the referral, I will likely be required for confidentiality purposes to remain silent about our investigations.""

""However, I will answer any questions you have to help you make a timely decision to remove her.""

Cook came under intense pressure to leave her post on Wednesday morning, after Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte publicly accused her of possible mortgage fraud and urged the DOJ to launch a criminal probe.

Pulte has been an aggressive opponent of Powell, whose reluctance to lower interest rates has stoked a barrage of criticism from Trump.

Trump previously entertained the possibility of firing Powell before his term expires next May, but he has backed off those threats. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Trump has told aides that he is now considering firing Cook.

Cook, who was nominated by former President Joe Biden in 2022, voted with the majority on the Federal Open Market Committee to keep rates unchanged after the group's latest meeting last month.

Pulte's central allegation is that Cook claimed two different properties as her primary residence at the same time.

""You cannot do that in America,"" he said on CNBC on Wednesday afternoon.

Trump declared in a social media post Wednesday morning that Cook ""must resign, now!!!""

But Cook said Wednesday that she has ""no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.""

""I learned from the media that FHFA Director William Pulte posted on social media that he was making a criminal referral based on a mortgage application from four years ago, before I joined the Federal Reserve,"" Cook said in a statement.

""I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts,"" she said.

If you have any U.S. technology stocks in your portfolio (and let's face it, who doesn't?), you might want to look away.

For the second day in a row, tech stocks dragged markets lower, with the Nasdaq Composite slipping 0.67%. Juggernauts such as Apple, Amazon and Alphabet were more meh-nificent than magnificent, falling more than 1%.

Palantir — the standout S&P 500 stock, having more than doubled so far this year — had its sixth consecutive day in the red and lost its place among a ranking of the 20 most valuable U.S. companies.

While Palantir's slide was partly triggered by a report from short seller Andrew Left's Citron Research, which called the company ""detached from fundamentals and analysis,"" there was no single trigger for the broader pullback.

Investors could have been spooked by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's caution about an AI bubble forming, although some analysts dispute that assertion. ""In our view the tech bull cycle will be well intact at least for another 2-3 years,"" said Wall Street tech bull Dan Ives.

Or it could be something benign, like traders locking in profits. ""Tech stocks,"" said Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth, ""have had an incredibly strong run – with some up over 80% since the early April lows.""

Summer, after all, is far from over. Some investors might have just wanted to cash out for another round of margaritas.

Fed officials divided over inflation and employment worries. Central bank governors generally agreed there were risks on both sides. But a couple — breaking from the majority — saw the labor market woes as more pressing, according to minutes of the Fed's July meeting.

No new solar or wind power projects, Trump says. Renewable energy projects will no longer receive approval, Trump posted Wednesday on Truth Social. His comment comes after the administration already tightened federal permitting last month. 

Meta Platforms freezes hiring artificial intelligence talent. The tech giant had in recent months been splashing out eye-watering amounts of money — up to $100 million on signing bonuses — to poach AI employees at other firms. But it appears that cash pool's left to dry for now.

Fourth day of losses for the S&P 500. Technology stocks declined on Wednesday, with Palantir having its sixth straight losing day. Asia-Pacific markets were mostly lower Thursday — but Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose to break the 9,000 level for the first time.

[PRO] The Fed is expected to cut just as markets trade at highs. This is what tends to happen when both factors coincide, according to Goldman Sachs research.

Red carpet for Putin, trade relief for China, penalties on India: Inside Trump's peculiar policy playbook

U.S. President Donald Trump is pursuing an unusual strategy — courting Russian President Vladimir Putin, holding fire on Beijing, all the while turning the screws on India.

Despite India being one of the earliest nations to engage in negotiations with the Trump administration, there is still no sign of it sealing a deal with America. New Delhi is now also staring at a secondary tariff of 25% or a ""penalty"" for its purchases of Russian oil that is set to come into effect later this month.

Meta Platforms has paused hiring for its new artificial intelligence division, the company confirmed Thursday, ending a spending spree that saw it acquire a wave of costly AI researchers and engineers.

The pause was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which said it went into effect last week amid a broader restructuring of the group, citing people familiar with the matter. 

In a statement shared with CNBC, a Meta spokesperson said that the pause was simply ""some basic organizational planning: creating a solid structure for our new superintelligence efforts after bringing people on board and undertaking yearly budgeting and planning exercises.""

According to the WSJ report, a recent restructuring inside Meta has divided its AI efforts into four teams. That includes a team focused on building machine superintelligence, dubbed the ""TBD lab,"" or ""To Be Determined,"" an AI products division, an infrastructure division, and a division that focuses on longer-term projects and exploration.

It added that all four groups belong to ""Meta Superintelligence Labs,"" a name that reflects Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's desire to build AI that surpasses human intelligence.

In pursuit of that goal, Meta has been aggressively spending on AI this year. That included efforts to poach top talent from other AI companies, with offers said to include signing bonuses as high as $100 million.  

In one of its most aggressive moves, Meta acquired Alexandr Wang, founder of Scale AI, as part of a deal that saw the Facebook parent dish out $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in the AI startup. 

Wang now leads the company's AI lab focused on advancing its Llama series of open-source large language models.

While Meta's aggressive hiring strategy has caught headlines in recent months for their high price tags, other megacap tech companies have also been pouring billions into AI talent, as well as R&D and AI infrastructure. 

However, the sudden AI hiring pause by the owner of Facebook and Instagram comes amid growing concerns that investments in AI are moving too fast and a broader sell-off of U.S. technology stocks this week.

Earlier this week, it was reported that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had told a group of journalists that he believes AI is in a bubble. 

However, many tech analysts and investors disagree with the notion of an AI bubble. 

""Altman is the golden child of the AI Revolution, and there could be aspects of the AI food chain that show some froth over time, but overall, we believe tech stocks are undervalued relative to this 4th Industrial Revolution,"" said tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.

He also dismissed the idea that Meta might be cutting back on AI spending in a meaningful way, saying that Meta is simply in ""digestion mode"" after a massive spending spree. 

""After making several acquisition-sized offers and hires in the nine-figure range, I see the hiring freeze as a natural resting point for Meta,"" added Daniel Newman, CEO at Futurum Group.

Before pouring more investment into its AI teams, the company likely needs time to place and access its new talent and determine whether they are ready to make the type of breakthroughs the company is looking for, he added.

In this article

Walmart on Thursday raised its full-year earnings and sales outlook as its online business posted another quarter of double-digit gains, even as the company said costs are rising from higher tariffs. 

The big-box retailer topped Wall Street's quarterly sales estimates but fell short of earnings expectations, the first time it missed on quarterly earnings since May 2022. The company said it felt pressure on profits for the period, including from some one-time expenses, such as restructuring costs, pricier insurance claims and litigation settlements.

Walmart said it now expects net sales to grow between 3.75% and 4.75% for the fiscal year, up from its previous expectations for 3% to 4%. It raised its adjusted earnings per share outlook slightly to $2.52 to $2.62, up from a prior range of $2.50 to $2.60 per share.

In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said the company is working hard to keep prices low – including speeding up imports from overseas and stepping up the number of Rollbacks, or limited-time discounts, in its stores. 

""This is managed on an item-by-item and category-by-category basis,"" he said. ""There are certainly areas where we have fully absorbed the impact of higher tariff costs. There are other areas where we've had to pass some of those costs along.""

But he added ""tariff-impacted costs are continuing to drift upwards."" 

Even so, Rainey said Walmart hasn't seen a change in customer spending. For example, sales of private-label items, which typically cost less than national brands, were roughly flat year over year, he said.

""Everyone is looking to see if there are any creaks in the armor or anything that's happening with the consumer, but it's been very consistent,"" he said. ""They continue to be very resilient.""

Yet on the company's earnings call, CEO Doug McMillon said middle- and lower-income households have been more sensitive to tariff-related price increases, particularly in discretionary categories.

""We see a corresponding moderation in units at the item level as customers switch to other items, or in some cases, categories,"" he said.

Here's what the big-box retailer reported for the fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Walmart shares fell 4% in morning trading Thursday.

Walmart's net income jumped to $7.03 billion, or 88 cents per share, in the three-month period that ended July 31, compared with $4.50 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, including legal charges, Walmart reported adjusted earnings per share of 68 cents.

Revenue rose from $169.34 billion in the year-ago quarter. 

Comparable sales for Walmart U.S. climbed 4.6% in the second quarter, excluding fuel, compared with the year-ago period, as both the grocery and health and wellness category saw strong growth. That was higher than the 4% increase that analysts expected. The industry metric, also called same-store sales, includes sales from stores and clubs open for at least a year.

At Sam's Club, comparable sales jumped 5.9% excluding fuel, higher than the 5.2% that analysts anticipated.

E-commerce sales jumped 25% globally and 26% in the U.S., as both online purchases and advertising grew. In the U.S., Walmart said sales through store-fulfilled delivery of groceries and other items grew nearly 50% year over year, with one-third of those orders expedited. The company charges a fee for some of those faster deliveries, and others are included as a benefit of its subscription-based membership program, Walmart+.

Its global advertising business grew 46% year over year, including Vizio, the smart TV maker it acquired for $2.3 billion last year. Its U.S. advertising business, Walmart Connect, grew by 31%.

As Walmart's online business drums up more revenue from home deliveries, advertising and commissions from sellers on its third-party marketplace, e-commerce has become a profitable business. The company marked a milestone in May — posting its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business in the U.S. and globally.

Rainey said Thursday that Walmart doubled its e-commerce profitability in the fiscal second quarter from the prior quarter.

In the U.S., shoppers both visited Walmart more and spent more on those trips during the quarter. Customer transactions rose 1.5% year over year and the average ticket increased 3.1% for Walmart's U.S. business.

As the largest U.S. retailer, Walmart offers a unique window into the financial health of American households. As higher duties have come in fits and starts — with some getting delayed and others going into effect earlier this month — Wall Street has tried to understand how those costs will ripple through the U.S. economy.

Walmart warned in May that it would have to raise some prices due to higher levies on imports, even with its size and scale. The company's comments drew the ire of President Donald Trump, who said in a social media post that Walmart should ""EAT THE TARIFFS.""

About a third of what Walmart sells in the U.S. comes from other parts of the world, with China, Mexico, Canada, Vietnam and India representing its largest markets for imports, Rainey said in May.

According to an analysis by CNBC of about 50 items sold by the retailer, some of those price changes have already hit shelves. Items that rose in price at Walmart over the summer included a frying pan, a pair of jeans and a car seat.

Rainey on Thursday declined to specify items or categories where Walmart had increased prices, saying the company is ""trying to keep prices as low as we can.""

He said one of the company's strategies has been bringing in inventory early, particularly for Sam's Club as it gets ready for the second half of the fiscal year and its crucial holiday season. At the end of the quarter, inventory was up about 3.5% at Sam's Club, Rainey said. It was up 2.2% for Walmart U.S.

On the company's earnings call, McMillon said the impact of tariffs has been ""gradual enough that any behavioral adjustments by the customer have been somewhat muted.""

""But as we replenish inventory at post-tariff price levels, we've continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue into the third and fourth quarters,"" he said.

Yet even with higher costs from tariffs, Walmart has fared better than its retail competitors as it has leaned into its reputation for value, competed on faster deliveries to customers' homes and attracted more business from higher-income households.

The Arkansas-based retailer's performance has diverged sharply from rival Target, which posted another quarter of sales declines on Wednesday and named the new CEO who will be tasked with trying to turn around the company.

Walmart has gained from Target's struggles. It has followed the Target playbook by launching more exclusive and trend-driven brands, including grocery brand BetterGoods and activewear brand Love & Sports. It has also expanded its third-party marketplace to include prestige beauty brands and more.

Sales of general merchandise, items outside of the grocery department, were a bright spot for Walmart in the fiscal second quarter, Rainey said. That category struggled during peak inflation in recent years, as consumers spent less on discretionary items because of rising grocery bills. 

Comparable sales for general merchandise rose by a low single-digit percentage and accelerated throughout the quarter, Rainey told CNBC. He added clothing and fashion sales ""really shined for us.""

In this article

Chipotle is teaming up with drone delivery leader Zipline to test autonomous food delivery.

Beginning Thursday, select customers in the greater Dallas area will have the option to use the so-called Zipotle delivery through an early access program in the Zipline app. Zipline's autonomous aircraft will deliver orders to customers' homes from a Rowlett, Texas Chipotle location. 

A small number of Zipline users will be able to order the full Chipotle menu to start, with a broader service launch in the weeks to come for more users. Any potential expansions in the future would be based on learnings from the test.

Employees will place the order into a Zipping Point, which allows aircraft to autonomously pick up the order for delivery. After flying to its destination, the aircraft will hover about 300 feet in the air, while the Zip, a droid, lowers to the ground. 

""The exciting thing about drone delivery is we don't need to have specific drone locations at every restaurant to make this effective,"" Curt Garner, president and chief strategy and technology officer at Chipotle, told CNBC in an interview. ""Because of the coverage radius of drones, it might only be one restaurant in a particular neighborhood that can service the entire neighborhood. So that makes national expansion easier, finding those locations and then equipping them with Zipline.""

The drone delivery option could resonate with a younger consumer base, which is already key for Chipotle and its future growth.

""I think the younger consumer remains an enormous market opportunity for us. They're the biggest fans of Chipotle already,"" Garner said. ""They do skew higher to delivery than older consumers, and they're a curious group of people that want to try new things. And based upon how many younger people live together in apartments or in shared housing, drone delivery is a really good option.""

The move comes as Chipotle and other fast-casual restaurants hit a sales slowdown. Chipotle reported that same store sales fell 4% in its most recent quarter as traffic declined. Its slow quarter came as the broader restaurant industry faced a pullback.

But Chipotle executives told analysts the chain's sales trends are turning around. Starting in June, customers had been returning to Chipotle restaurants, thanks to its summer promotions and the launch of its Adobo Ranch dip, CEO Scott Boatwright said.

Zipline is launching Chipotle deliveries with its Platform 2 models, which are insulated to withstand rain, cold and heat. The company has said they are also fast and quiet.

Initially, the ""Zipotle"" delivery service will carry orders up to 5.5 pounds, which will increase to eight pounds over time. The delivery is a $2.99 flat cost, plus a 15% service fee capped at $6, Garner said. ""Zipotle"" will operate seven days a week from 12 p.m. to 8 p.m. CT, with plans to expand to 10 p.m. CT.

Zipline, a CNBC Disruptor 50 company, says it operates on four continents, makes a delivery somewhere in the world every 60 seconds, and serves more than 5,000 hospitals and health facilities. It says it has flown more than 100 million commercial autonomous miles.  

""It's a better product experience. It's better for the environment, it's less expensive, and importantly, it also increases access,"" Zipline CEO Keller Rinaudo Cliffton told CNBC.

Food delivery by drone may expand further soon. Zipline said it will be working with Sweetgreen to determine timing and locations for a future launch.

In this article

Starbucks will expand its test of coconut water beverages to hundreds of more stores, as it leans further into health and wellness.

Starting Thursday, the coffee giant will test its Coco Matcha and Coco Cold Brew drinks in more than 400 stores across major cities including New York, Los Angeles and the greater Chicago area. The drinks layer matcha foam or cold brew foam over coconut water.

Starbucks first tested the coconut beverages in New York City as a part of its ""Starting Five"" innovation program, in which it tests out new ideas in five coffeehouses and seeks feedback from its baristas and customers before pushing those ideas into additional stores. Starbucks did not share plans for further expansion beyond the regional test this month.

""Health and wellness at Starbucks isn't a trend — it's a long-standing commitment.  Expanding the test of our Coco Matcha and Coco Cold Brew beverages is the next step to accelerate our health and wellness beverage innovation plan,"" Dana Pellicano, senior vice president of Starbucks global product experience, said in a statement to CNBC. ""We are incorporating real-time feedback with a focus on transparency, functionality, and evolving consumer needs.""

Cold foam has become one of the chain's most popular modifiers, as it grew 23% year over year, CEO Brian Niccol told analysts on its most recent earnings call. Starbucks will launch protein cold foam late in the fourth quarter, part of its push to kick-start sales after a stretch of financial results that has disappointed Wall Street.

""Protein cold foam with no added sugar is an easy way to add 15 grams of protein to virtually any cold beverage. And customers can also add the flavor of their choice,"" Niccol told analysts.

The expanded Starbucks test is part of a larger trend of top restaurant chains increasing beverage options, driven in part by younger consumers who crave customized cold drinks and healthier options.

The number of beverages offered by the top 500 chains has increased more than 9% over the past year, according to Technomic's 2025 Away-From-Home Beverage Navigator Report released in July. Companies have leaned even more into cold drinks. Offerings such as specialty coffees and energy drinks have seen the most growth on menus over the past two years, as hot coffee and tea beverages on menus decline, the market researcher reported.

Starbucks is in the middle of its ""Back to Starbucks"" turnaround plans under Niccol, featuring more cafe renovations and menu changes. As the strategy takes shape, Starbucks executives have said the company has seen increases in satisfaction among younger consumers. Niccol told analysts customer value perceptions were near two-year highs in its most recent quarter, driven by gains among Gen Z and millennials, who make up over half its customer base.

Starbucks is betting that innovation, coupled with better experiences under its new ""Green Apron Service"" strategy, will help to boost business. While Starbucks also posted better-than-expected U.S. sales last quarter, they still fell 2% from the prior-year period.

Starbucks shares have fallen just more than 1% this year.

In addition to the New York, Los Angeles and Chicago areas, Starbucks will also test the coconut water drinks in select cities in the Midwest including Cedar Rapids, Iowa; St. Louis, Missouri; Springfield, Illinois; South Bend, Indiana; and Madison and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

LONDON — European stocks lost ground on Thursday after officials unveiled new details on the trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed 0.04% lower, snapping a three-session winning run. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 added 0.23% to extend its record high, while the French CAC 40 shed 0.44%. Germany's DAX closed 0.06% higher.

In an agreement reached last month, the EU said it would spend $750 billion on U.S. energy and invest a minimum of $600 billion in the United States — in exchange, blanket tariffs on its goods were set at 15% instead of the 30% rate threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump.

However, in-depth details on how certain European industries would be impacted by the agreement were not revealed until Thursday.

Pharmaceuticals exported from the EU to the U.S. will see tariffs capped at 15%, Thursday's announcement showed. Trump had previously suggested tariffs on the sector could be hiked as high as 250%.  

The immediate reaction among pharma stocks listed in Europe was somewhat muted, though the Stoxx Europe Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology index eventually closed 0.56% higher. Top performers in the sector included Danish allergy specialist ALK, up 5%, biotech firm Abivax, up 6%, and Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk, which gained 3%.

It was also confirmed on Thursday that the EU's autos sector will be subject to 15% tariffs. However, officials revealed that this tariff rate — almost half the current rate — would only come into effect after Brussels introduced legislation to lower its industrial duties.

The Stoxx Europe Automobiles and Parts index closed 0.58% lower as investors reacted to the ""conditional"" nature of the tariffs reduction for the sector.

Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC on Thursday that autos stocks could soon respond more notably to the trade agreement.

""Stocks haven't responded as expected to greater clarity from this trade deal,"" he said. ""This could be due to the level of market noise we are seeing. There is a lot happening in markets, but this news is a positive and should gradually get priced in once the markets' attention shifts.""

Looking at individual stocks, British retailer WH Smith plummeted 42% after the company revised its guidance for North America.

Ahead of the end of its fiscal year, WH Smith said it had identified a £30 million ($40.35 million) ""overstatement"" of anticipated headline trading profit in its North America branch.

""WHSmith now expects Headline trading profit from the North America division for the financial year ending 31 August 2025 to be approximately £25m, down from previous market expectations of approximately £55m,"" the company said in a statement on Thursday morning.

Meanwhile, shares of ticketing giant CTS Eventim tumbled 17% on Thursday. The company reported record first-half revenue, but said its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) fell 8.9% year-on-year in the second quarter of the year. The company's live entertainment segment meanwhile reported a 39.7% drop in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter.

Elon Musk was ordered on Wednesday by a federal judge to face a lawsuit by voters accusing the world's richest person of defrauding them into signing a petition to support the U.S. Constitution for a chance to win his $1 million-a-day giveaway.

U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman in Austin, Texas, said Jacqueline McAferty plausibly alleged in her proposed class action that Musk and his political action committee America PAC wrongly induced her to provide personal identifying information as part of the giveaway, late in the 2024 election campaign.

Lawyers for Musk and America PAC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Musk founded America PAC to support Republican Donald Trump's successful 2024 presidential run.

McAferty, an Arizona resident, said Musk and America PAC induced voters in seven battleground states to sign his petition by promising that $1 million recipients would be chosen randomly, as in a lottery, though the voters had no real chance to collect.

She said voters who signed were also required to provide names, addresses, email addresses and phone numbers.

In seeking a dismissal, Musk listed several ""red flags"" as proof he had not run an illegal lottery.

He said these included statements that the $1 million recipients were ""selected to earn"" the money and expected to become America PAC spokespeople, defeating the idea that the payment was a ""prize.""

But the judge cited other statements suggesting the defendants were ""awarding"" the $1 million, and the money could be ""won.""

""It is plausible that plaintiff justifiably relied on those statements to believe that defendants were objectively offering her the chance to enter a random lottery--even if that is not what they subjectively intended to do,"" Pitman wrote.

The judge was appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama in 2014.

Musk had also rejected the suggestion that petition signers suffered harm by providing contact information. Pitman said an expert in political data brokerage could testify what that information was worth for voters in battleground states.

The lawsuit was filed on Election Day, Nov. 5, 2024.

A day earlier, a Philadelphia judge refused to end Musk's giveaway, saying that the city's top prosecutor failed to show it was an illegal lottery.

Musk is a Texas resident, and his electric car company, Tesla, is based in Austin.

Key bitcoin BTC$112,255.74 indicators are signaling a potential shift to a bearish market regime as traders await Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's remarks at the Jackson Hole Symposium.

The first one is the 180-day call-put skew derived from options trading on Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange by volume and open interest.

As of writing, the 180-day skew was negative 0.42, the lowest since June 2023, according to data source Amberdata. A negative call-put skew suggests that traders are pricing in greater demand for put options (which offer protection against price declines) relative to call options. The data can be interpreted as rising market caution or bearish sentiment over the medium term.

""BTC longer dated skew flipping into put premium could be a sign of regime shift,"" Imran Lakha, founder of Options Insights, said on X.

The negative reading comes across as a regime shift, as it follows two years of consistently positive values, which reflected a bias toward bullish call options.

More importantly, BTC has only pulled back by roughly 8% from its record highs above $124,000, which were reached a week ago. Yet, the long-term sentiment has flipped bearish.

According to Lakha, the price pullback has triggered demand for put options.

""BTC and ETH skews are pulling toward put premium as markets correct. BTC doesn't show a call premium again until March 2026. The move lower triggered buying of August/September puts around the $110,000 strike. Calls and call spreads are being sold as longs de-risk into Powell's Jackson Hole speech on Friday,"" Lakha said in a blog post.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak at the central bank's annual Jackson Hole Symposium on Friday. Most traders expect Powell to signal rate cuts starting from September and if he gives what's expected, the market may correct, according to Nansen's research analyst Nicolai Sondergaard.

""At this stage, the market broadly expects cuts, so much of that is already priced in. If Powell delivers exactly what's anticipated, crypto could see sideways to slightly bearish action, a classic “sell the news” dynamic. By contrast, if the Fed signals a deeper or faster cutting cycle than expected, that could spark fresh risk appetite and set the stage for the next bullish leg in crypto,"" Sondergaard said.

The demand for downside protection in BTC is consistent with the activity on Wall Street, where traders have been preparing for a sell-off in the major technology stocks.

""Traders are buying 'disaster' puts on the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index,"" Jeff Jacobson, head of derivative strategy at 22V Research Group, told Bloomberg.

The second indicator pointing to a bearish shift in the regime is the Guppy multiple moving average (GMMA) indicator.

Developed by Australian trader Daryl Guppy, the indicator is used to identify reversals and assess trend strength by analyzing the bands formed by short-term and long-term moving averages. A bullish cross occurs when the green band representing short-term moving averages crosses above the red band of long-term moving averages, indicating that upward momentum is gathering pace.

BTC's price has crossed below the Guppy moving average bands, a sign that bulls are losing control and the long-term sentiment may be turning bearish. This is often considered a warning sign that downside momentum is about to strengthen, paving the way for pronounced price weakness.

Other indicators, such as the MACD histogram, also suggest a strengthening of the downside momentum.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Why Is Bitcoin Wobbling? Is it Powell's Jackson Hole Speech?","https://www.tipranks.com/news/why-is-bitcoin-wobbling-is-it-powells-jackson-hole-speech","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 14:41:06 GMT","

Bitcoin slid near $112K as traders waited for Powell's Jackson Hole speech to clarify the Fed's next move.

Bitcoin slipped below $113,000 this week, briefly touching $112,565, its lowest point since early August. That drop set off alarms across crypto markets. It comes just as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver a very very important speech at the central bank's Jackson Hole gathering. So, is Powell really the reason Bitcoin is wobbling right now? The short answer is yes, but it's not just Powell alone.





The reality is that Bitcoin no longer trades in its own bubble. Over the years, it has become increasingly tied to the same macroeconomic forces that drive stocks, bonds, and currencies. This means that when the Fed hints at raising or cutting rates, Bitcoin often reacts in lockstep with other risk assets.

One of the big reasons behind the wobble is new inflation data. Consumer prices rose 2.7% year-over-year in July, still well above the Fed's 2% comfort zone. That might not sound huge, but for central bankers it's a red flag. Just last week, markets were pricing in a September rate cut with more than 94% certainty. After the inflation release, those odds slipped closer to 82%, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

For Bitcoin, this is important because liquidity is its lifeblood. Rate cuts pump more money into the system, and some of that money often finds its way into crypto. If rate cuts look less likely, traders get nervous. That's exactly what's playing out now.

Still, Bitcoin hasn't completely unraveled. The $112,000 mark has turned into the line everyone's watching. If Bitcoin can cling on there until Powell talks, traders think it has a shot at snapping back. If it slips under, though, that's when the nervous selling could snowball.

This is classic crypto psychology. Everyone knows support levels aren't life-changing, but they influence behavior. Right now, the question isn't just “What will Powell say?” but also “Can Bitcoin hold the floor long enough to buy time for buyers to return?”

So why does one speech matter this much? Because Powell isn't just addressing economists in Wyoming, he's communicating the Fed's priorities to the entire global market. If he focuses on inflation, rate cuts could be delayed, which keeps pressure on Bitcoin. If he acknowledges weakening jobs data and hints at cuts, traders may see it as a green flag to re-enter.

The repercussions could be huge because markets want clarity. Powell's tone could shift Bitcoin's short-term trajectory from a dip to a rebound, or even deepen the slide.

The interesting thing is that while traders stress over every Powell headline, corporations keep quietly building their Bitcoin reserves. Nearly 300 public and private entities now hold more than 3.6 million BTC, about 17% of supply. That's a powerful reminder that, behind the noise of short-term dips, long-term adoption is still climbing.

This steady accumulation suggests that while Powell's speech might shake markets in the short run, the broader Bitcoin story isn't going away. Institutions are treating these dips less as disasters and more as opportunities.

To answer the headline's question directly, Bitcoin is wobbling because investors are nervous about Powell's Jackson Hole speech, nervous about inflation, and nervous about whether September brings rate cuts or delays. It's a cocktail of macro uncertainty that crypto has learned it can't ignore.

But the bigger takeaway is that Bitcoin's fate isn't sealed by one speech. Yes, Powell could rattle the market. But corporate accumulation, long-term adoption, and the eventual path of interest rates will likely matter more than one week's volatility.

In other words, Bitcoin is wobbling, but the foundations underneath are still there, waiting for clarity, waiting for liquidity, and waiting for the next big move.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is sitting at $113,588.52.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","9 Ways Bitcoin Treasury Companies Can Differentiate In A Crowded Market","https://bitcoinmagazine.com/bitcoin-for-corporations/bitcoin-treasury-companies-differentiate","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 12:31:19 GMT","

There was a time when holding Bitcoin was enough. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) proved it in 2020—simply moving idle cash into Bitcoin electrified markets, drove premiums above NAV, and rewrote corporate playbooks. But five years later, the battlefield has changed.

Dozens of public companies across Japan, France, the U.S., the U.K., Sweden, Canada, and Brazil now run Bitcoin treasury strategies. ETFs have captured billions in flows. El Salvador holds it as sovereign reserve. In this environment, “we own Bitcoin” is no longer a differentiator.

If a company cannot compete on size, speed, or scale, it must assemble alternative sources of firepower to win over shareholders and maintain its mNAV premium. Without it, momentum stalls, media cycles fade, and mNAV grinds down toward 1—or below.

Why it matters. Jurisdiction sets the cost of capital, the shape of your investor base, and the menu of corporate instruments you can legally deploy. It is a design variable, not a constraint.

What it unlocks. In Japan, ultra-low rates and NISA eligibility made zero-coupon, premium-redeemable debt and retail inflows a rational path. In France, PEA-PME turns qualified equities into long-horizon, tax-advantaged vehicles, ideal for controlled floats and large ATMs. In the U.S., fair-value accounting and deep markets enable layered stacks across convertibles, secured bonds, preferreds, and ATMs. Elsewhere (U.K., Sweden, Canada, Brazil), wrappers and local capital habits create distinct demand curves that equities can tap even when local ETF options are limited or structurally different.

Operator's takeaway. Your jurisdiction should amplify your intended shareholder mix (retail wrappers vs. institutions), your funding cadence (episodic raises vs. rolling ATMs), and your narrative (innovation vs. stability). Treat geography as a capital tool.

Why this role works. Markets do not just underwrite balance sheets; they underwrite operators and storytellers. A Head of Bitcoin Strategy concentrates credibility, turns complex treasury moves into plain-English updates, and acts as a public interface to the Bitcoin community. Done well, it blends execution oversight, digital IR, and content amplification into one compounding asset.

Which companies are leaning in?

Operator's takeaway. A seasoned Bitcoiner in a visible, accountable role is leverage for your IR strategy. It reduces mispricing risk, speeds consensus with investors, and turns every operational step into earned media.

Why it matters. “How you fund” is as important as “what you hold.” Instruments are not interchangeable; each taps a different pool and tells a different story.

Execution nuance. Mechanically, your stack should: (a) diversify counterparty types, (b) sequence issuances to keep purchase cadence alive, and (c) present a clean, repeatable narrative: “Here's how capital becomes Bitcoin per share without reckless dilution.”

Operator's takeaway. Treat the capital stack like a product line. It should scale, segment, and sell—again and again.

What “deep” actually means. Deep pools are not just “big markets.” They are pre-committed or quickly addressable channels that allow you to raise, deploy, signal, and repeat without stalling. That loop is the flywheel: issuance → Bitcoin purchase → KPI improvement → coverage → larger issuance → repeat.

Why it's essential. Without depth, you burn through one raise, make one splashy purchase, and then disappear for quarters. Coverage dies, skeptics set the narrative, and mNAV compresses. With depth, you keep the drumbeat: recurring buys that keep you in the news cycle, maintain attention from incremental buyers, and compound trust.

How leaders operationalize depth.

Operator's takeaway. Depth is a system you build in advance. If you can't raise quickly and predictably, you can't stack predictably—and you won't hold your premium.

Discipline is visible. Boards and investors can tell when a team runs a real playbook. Discipline shows up as speed, sequencing, and risk controls—not slogans.

What disciplined operators do.

Operator's takeaway. The market rewards professionalism under time pressure. Discipline lowers cost of capital, earns trust, and sustains your ability to repeat the cycle.

Why profits matter. External capital is accelerant; operating cash flow is oxygen. A business that funds part of its Bitcoin accumulation from profits builds an organic stacking engine that does not depend on market mood.

Mechanics that work.

Operator's takeaway. Treat profits as a perpetual reserve-replacement plan. You're not just raising to grow reserves; you're running a business that mints reserves.

Premiums are a function of information symmetry. Markets punish opacity with parity pricing. They reward clarity with durable premiums.

What exemplary IR looks like.

Operator's takeaway. Treat IR as your company's valuation infrastructure. The faster and clearer you collapse uncertainty, the longer you can defend a premium.

Attention is an input, not an outcome. Capital markets are social systems; what investors see and hear shapes what they can underwrite.

How leaders manufacture visibility.

Operator's takeaway. Visibility without substance is hype; substance without visibility is underpriced. You need both to keep incremental buyers coming in at a premium.

The reach advantage. Uplisting and cross-listing expand your addressable investor base, improve liquidity, and tighten spreads—each a contributor to sustained premiums.

What to optimize.

Operator's takeaway. Uplisting multiplies pools of capital you can tap on demand, which multiplies your ability to keep buying, which multiplies trust.

If you don't build firepower, the market will price you at parity. One raise, one purchase, one press cycle—and then silence. Coverage fades. Spread widens. Incremental buyers wait for lower. mNAV converges to 1. At that point, your equity competes poorly against spot exposure: no yield, no narrative, no reason to choose you.

But if you do build it, you gain compounding advantages:

The difference between weak and strong firepower is not ideology—it's operating tempo and capital design. This is a balance-sheet business. Treat it that way.

Bitcoin For Corporations exists to help leadership teams not just hold Bitcoin—but build the firepower to sustain premiums, secure capital depth, and earn long-term investor trust.

BFC delivers this through four pillars:

Together, these give treasury leaders the positioning, insight, and connectivity to move early and move well.

Markets are quickly recalibrating previously lofty odds of an imminent rate cut as the jets touch down in Jackson Hole for the Kansas City Fed's Economic Symposium.

The current data does not make the case for a September ease, said Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, speaking with Yahoo News in Wyoming.

""We have inflation that's too high and has been trending upwards over the past year,"" she said. ""If the meeting was tomorrow, I would not see a case for reducing interest rates.""

She further argued that inflation numbers are only beginning to show the impact of tariffs and that the full effect wouldn't be seen until next year.

Hammack's comments are notable, showing Fed Chair Jerome Powell continues to have plenty of support in his hawkish stance despite two dissident dovish votes at the last central bank policy meeting and President Trump's continuing campaign for lower rates.

Her remarks also come after a series of potential Powell replacements appeared on the airwaves in recent days to argue for sharply lower interest rates. The latest this morning was former St. Louis Fed boss Jim Bullard, who argued for policy rates 100 basis points below the current level.

Just one week ago, bitcoin touched a record high above $124,000 alongside a nearly 100% expectation that the Fed would trim rates next month. Seven days later, those odds have slipped back to 71%, according to CME FedWatch and bitcoin BTC$112,281.87 has plunged nearly 10% to the current $112,800.

Markets will get to hear from Powell himself at his keynote address on Friday morning and at this point it's nearly certain he'll not turn dove. Instead, he's likely to emphasize that inflation continues to remain too hot and thus the need to take a wait and see approach towards adjusting monetary policy.

The value of ETH holdings by 69 entities has surpassed 4.1 million ETH, worth approximately $17.6 billion, as more organizations seek to invest in Ethereum.

Data from StrategicETHReserve shows that the total value of ETH holdings in treasuries stood at 4.1 million, covering 69 entities that hold more than 100 ETH. That represented about 3.39% of the total ETH supply.

Among them, BitMine Immersion Technologies holds the largest amount of ETH, with roughly 1.5 million ETH valued at about $6.6 billion. It has shifted its business focus from bitcoin mining to ether accumulation. 

SharpLink Gaming ranks second in ETH holdings, with approximately 740,800 ETH worth about $3.2 billion in its treasury. The Ether Machine holds about 345,400 ETH, while the Ethereum Foundation holds 231,600 ETH.

Digital asset treasuries (DATs) have gained traction, with Ethereum treasuries becoming a focal point in the crypto industry. Notably, the cumulative ETH treasury holdings by public companies reached 2.6 million ETH, or about $10.9 billion, as of Wednesday, according to The Block's dashboard.



Meanwhile, U.S. spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds hold roughly 6.7 million ETH, representing about 5.5% of ETH's current supply, according to The Block's ETF data.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Ethereum has outpaced Bitcoin in recent weeks, with JPMorgan analysts pointing to a combination of exchange-traded fund inflows, corporate treasury adoption, regulatory clarity, and structural ETF improvements as the main drivers.

Ethereum ETFs saw a record $5.4 billion of inflows in July, matching Bitcoin ETFs for the month, JPMorgan analysts led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou noted in a report Wednesday. While spot Bitcoin ETFs have since recorded small outflows in August, spot Ethereum ETFs have continued to attract capital, the analysts said.

Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin, particularly since the U.S. passed the GENIUS Act stablecoin law in July, and as investors anticipate another landmark crypto market structure bill by September.



The JPMorgan analysts highlighted four factors behind Ethereum's recent outperformance. First, the market expects the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to approve staking for spot Ethereum ETFs, which would allow asset managers to generate staking yields for investors without requiring them to hold the 32 ETH minimum.

Second, corporate treasuries have begun to add Ethereum, with about 10 public companies holding ETH on their balance sheets — representing 2.3% of the current circulating ETH supply. Some of these corporates are expected to run validators to earn passive staking income, while others may pursue yield through liquid staking and decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies, the analysts said.

Third, the SEC has offered staff-level clarifications suggesting that liquid staking tokens may not be treated as securities. The analysts said this has eased institutional concerns, though the statements have not yet been codified into law.

Fourth, the SEC's recent approval of in-kind redemptions for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs will allow institutions to redeem ETF shares directly in crypto rather than converting to cash. ""This brings more efficiency, a reduction in costs, and greater market liquidity to these ETFs and mitigates the need for liquidations during large withdrawals by investors,"" the JPMorgan analysts said.

Looking ahead, the analysts said Ethereum has more room to grow in both ETF and corporate treasury adoption when compared to Bitcoin. Corporate and institutional holdings of ETH currently lag those of BTC, leaving scope for further inflows if adoption trends continue.

The cryptocurrency market is showing signs of a shift as leading altcoins record stronger gains than Bitcoin. Bitcoin has been moving strongly so far this year, even reaching $124,000 in the middle of this month. However, in recent days it has started to dip, while several major alternative coins have pushed higher. This has raised questions about whether the much-anticipated “altcoin season” could be approaching.

Chainlink (LINK) is leading the group of strong movers. The token gained 13% yesterday, wiping out its earlier losses, and has carried that momentum into today with a further 5% rise in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. This upward trend is not limited to Chainlink, as other major altcoins are also posting notable gains.

BNB, the token of the BNB Chain, has been one of the strongest performers. Since the start of the month, it has risen steadily, reaching a new record of $882 on Wednesday, according to CoinMarketCap. It has since eased to around $862, yet the token remains more than 3% higher in the last 24 hours. The new milestone highlights the strength of demand for BNB compared to the rest of the market.

Ethereum has also moved higher after recovering from a brief drop. The token advanced 7% to $4,350, reversing the decline it saw the day before. Over the past 24 hours, it is still up more than 3%, continuing its rebound. Market analyst Michaël van de Poppe described the move as a strong recovery and noted it signals the possibility of another test of previous highs.

Other altcoins have joined the rise. Solana has gained more than 4%, Cardano has added 2.5%, and Aave is up more than 4%. Together, these moves underline how altcoins are currently outpacing Bitcoin.

In contrast, Bitcoin's gains remain modest. Over the past 24 hours, the largest cryptocurrency has added just 0.2% and is around $113,800. When compared to sharper rises seen in several altcoins, Bitcoin's performance looks muted.

A report from CryptoQuant suggests that demand for Bitcoin has slowed sharply. So, what are the data saying?

This cooling demand has been reflected in Bitcoin's share of the overall market. Its dominance is now close to a six-month low. At the same time, altcoins have been gaining traction, showing that investors are increasingly willing to direct capital away from Bitcoin and toward alternative assets.

While altcoins are outperforming, analysts suggest this period may not resemble previous cycles. ByteTree analysts Shehriyar Ali and Charlie Morris have pointed out that the next phase, if it develops into a full altcoin season, is unlikely to deliver the same broad surges seen in earlier years. Instead, they expect selective growth, where coins with strong fundamentals and proven utility are rewarded, while weaker tokens without solid backing may struggle to advance.

The Altcoin Index, currently at 41, reinforces this view. The measure shows that altcoins are holding up strongly against Bitcoin, and the current positioning leaves room for further upside if investor momentum continues to shift toward these assets.

      Bitcoin has finally broken into the mainstream after years as the noisy rebel of the financial system. Now, the Trump administration's crypto push could do the same for altcoins—at least some of them.


     
      For years, the world of cryptocurrencies operated as a financial Wild West, characterized by unchecked speculation, regulatory ambiguity, and occasionally spectacular downfalls. Now, just about three years after the collapse of exchange FTX shattered confidence in the sector, lawmakers are actively engaging in shaping rules to govern cryptos, classifying them as either commodities or securities. That, in turn, will remove the ambiguity and overlap over regulation, making investing less of a risk.


     
      “It adds more certainty that [cryptocurrency] is here to stay,"" Jamie Hopkins, CEO of Bryn Mawr Trust Advisors told Barron's.


     
      For years, it has been unclear just where crypto fits in to the world of financial assets. Despite their name, cryptocurrencies aren't regulated as currencies and there have been legal cases over whether certain tokens should be considered commodities or securities. That ambiguity has had impact on their supervision and regulatory overlap between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission. The lack of a regulatory framework left investors in limbo, while the many attempted cases of litigation and government enforcement have discouraged people wanting to enter the industry.


     
      “It creates a cautionary principle where you don't go to the edge of the cliff,"" Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan tells Barron's. “You have to stop a hundred yards from the edge of the cliff because you don't know where the cliff is.""


     
      A multiyear legal battle between Ripple Labs and the SEC served as a cautionary tale. The regulator charged Ripple in 2020 for selling XRP, which it considered an unregistered security. Ripple denied the accusations, arguing that XRP didn't act like a security and therefore shouldn't be subject to securities control.


     
      A district judge issued a split ruling in 2023 stating that retail XRP sales on public exchanges didn't qualify as securities transactions, however, some institutional sales did. After over four years, Ripple and the SEC finally settled and Ripple agreed to pay a fine of $125 million. In August this year, they jointly filed for dismissal of the case.


     
      The Clarity Act could be key to finally giving the industry the rules and predictability it has craved. It lays out a framework to distinguish whether digital assets are classified as commodities, overseen by the CFTC, or securities, under the jurisdiction of the SEC. Stablecoins, or coins typically pegged to the dollar that act like a crypto version of a money-market fund, have their own category and would fall under joint oversight of the SEC and the CFTC.


     
      The Act's backers say it gives the sector just that, while critics argue it doesn't do enough to ensure effective ways to enforce its rules and provide enough protection.


     
      The act still needs to pass through the Senate, which has published its own discussion draft market structure bill that would likely put most cryptos under SEC jurisdiction, although with exemptions from many aspects of securities laws.


     
      The House bill, would define a commodity as an asset with its value intrinsically linked to the use of a blockchain—that has a decentralized record of transactions maintained across computers. Furthermore that blockchain must be one that isn't controlled by any one person or group. Coins with a central issuer or controlling entity would fall under the SEC as a security. Most will want to avoid the latter, Hougan says. True value, he suggests, lies in the trust and characteristics of a truly decentralized ownership and governance structure. If a coin is too centralized to be classified as a commodity, it's little more than a “a bad database.""


     
      Law firm McMillan suggests a reconciliation process is expected that will converge both bills into a final text for passage.


     
      So far Bitcoin and Ether have typically been considered commodities by regulators due to their distinct decentralized nature of a broad ownership and governance structure, but most other coins remain largely undefined. Comparing them to Bitcoin or Ether would be like comparing the world's most valuable company, Nvidia, to a penny stock, Hougan says.


     
      For Bitcoin and Ether, regulatory advancements will be “strictly positive,"" he adds. It could reduce their notorious volatility as well as remove the reputational risk that surrounds cryptos. Other coins, however, face a potential divide.


     
      The total cryptocurrency market has a value of nearly $4 trillion—around the same as Microsoft—with Bitcoin accounting for about two thirds of that. The rest is altcoins, or alternative coins, of which there are thousands. About 80 tokens have a market capitalization of more than $1 billion, according to CoinDesk data.


     
      The new law could give cryptos tied to a blockchain a leg up on their competitors, according to Professor Sarit Markovich at Kellogg School of Management. She sees cryptos tied to a blockchain like Ether, Solana, and Ripple's XRP as “two-sided markets""—operating systems with app developers on one side and users on the other. Regulatory clarity and legitimacy would bring more users to these ecosystems, increasing their value and the price of the tokens tied to them, she says.


     
      In contrast, the long-term prospects for meme coins such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or $TRUMP, despite potential short-term price bumps, appear more challenging. Meme coins don't typically have their own blockchain but are built on top of other blockchains.


     
      While financial advisors are coming round to making a place for cryptos in portfolios, they are divided on coins besides Bitcoin. Hopkins says he recommends clients interested in cryptos invest between 1% and 3% in via spot ETFs such as those by Fidelity, BlackRock, and Bitwise, leaning toward the lower end of that range, as opposed to investing in the coins themselves.


     
      BlackRock offers the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF and the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF. Similarly, investors can buy the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund or the Fidelity Ethereum Fund.


     
      Bitwise also offers funds tracking the price of a basket of coins like the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund, which is heavily overweight on Bitcoin but also includes 1% or more of Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano, as well as minor holdings of Chainlink, Sui, Avalanche, Litecoin, and Polkadot.


     
      If passed, the legislation would remove a key impediment to investing in crypto by providing much-needed regulatory clarity. The Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund may be a good place to start.


     
      While many still oppose cryptos altogether, that battle appears to have been fought and lost. Digital assets are here to stay—maybe it's time to embrace them.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Is MAGACOIN FINANCE the Next Big Altcoin?","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/magacoin-finance-rising-star-altcoins-2025","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 12:28:28 GMT","

With the ever-changing landscape of cryptocurrencies, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing attention from investors searching for lucrative returns. In this article, we will examine MAGACOIN FINANCE's potential and its place beside well-known tokens like Ether and Chainlink. We will also touch on how to handle volatility and the possible risks of investing in new altcoins while considering the effect of regulatory shifts on altcoin acceptance. Join me as we explore this intriguing market and unveil exciting investment possibilities.

MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most popular Ethereum-based presales of 2025. Its viral branding, dedicated community engagement, and limited presale availability have cemented it as a candidate for potential speculative gain. Experts point to whale accumulation and early presale demand as positive indicators, forecasting returns of up to 35x as the next market cycle evolves.

What sets MAGACOIN apart from ordinary meme launches is the political and cultural narrative that fuels online buzz while also attracting serious interest from retail investors and larger smart-money wallets. This fusion of hype, scarcity, and genuine adoption metrics has led analysts to position MAGACOIN alongside Ethereum's heavyweights, suggesting it could be among the top investment choices of 2025.

While established tokens like Ether (ETH) and Chainlink (LINK) provide consistent utility and stability, MAGACOIN FINANCE brings forth a speculative opportunity with enormous upside potential. This may resonate with those willing to take on more risk. ETH remains critical for running decentralized applications, paying gas fees, and securing the broader network, while LINK powers decentralized oracles that bridge smart contracts with real-world data across different blockchains.

When weighed against these established tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE presents a question of risk versus reward. Established tokens like ETH and LINK may offer a steadier investment with a proven history. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE may appeal to those attracted by the potential for significant gains, albeit with increased volatility and risks.

There are several strategies investors can use to mitigate volatility in their crypto portfolios, including new players like MAGACOIN FINANCE. These strategies encompass diversification, dollar-cost averaging (DCA), staking, proactive management, and stringent security practices.

Diversification: Distributing investments across established cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) and promising altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE lessens the impact of any asset's volatility on the entire portfolio.

Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Regularly investing a fixed amount regardless of price volatility can help smooth out the purchase price over time and minimize emotionally driven trading. Extending this approach to MAGACOIN FINANCE may also yield long-term benefits.

Staking: Earning rewards by locking tokens in proof-of-stake networks helps offset losses during market downturns and can lead to an increase in holdings over time. This method can generate passive income while maintaining portfolio viability during turbulent times.

Proactive Management: Employing momentum trading in favorable market conditions or tactical strategies during market corrections enables adaptability. This style of management can also include dynamic rebalancing to bolster performance against volatility.

Volatility Risk Tools: Utilizing technical indicators such as Bollinger Bands and stop-loss orders allows for better monitoring of market movements and helps mitigate downside risks.

Security Measures: Protecting investments through secure wallets and multi-factor authentication, especially essential for new projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE that may still be solidifying their market presence.

Investing in new altcoins, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, is inherently risky compared to established tokens like Ether and Chainlink, despite the potential for much higher returns.

Greater Volatility and Speculative Nature: MAGACOIN FINANCE is characterized as a community-driven token, with price surges propelled by social media buzz and whale activity, resulting in extreme price fluctuations and a risk of rapid losses if momentum diminishes.

Unproven Track Record: Unlike Ether and Chainlink, which boast established adoption and institutional backing, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its infancy. Its long-term viability is contingent on sustained community support, broader exchange listings, and successful execution of its roadmap.

Regulatory and Security Vulnerabilities: Although MAGACOIN FINANCE has undergone audits and aims for regulatory compliance, new tokens inherently face greater risks from potential vulnerabilities, scams, or regulatory changes that could affect their valuation.

Market Liquidity and Exit Challenges: Smaller-cap altcoins tend to have lower liquidity, complicating the sale of large positions without impacting prices. Early investors may encounter additional challenges when exiting if the token fails to gain traction.

Recent regulatory developments in Asia and Europe are significantly influencing altcoin adoption among fintech startups and SMEs. Countries like Hong Kong and Singapore are leading in providing regulatory clarity, attracting investment, and enabling cross-border operations, providing a clear landscape for fintech startups.

The EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation offers passporting rights, allowing authorized crypto service providers to operate across all EU member states. This simplifies licensing but raises compliance expectations, posing challenges for SMEs.

Clear regulations enhance trust in digital assets, which is essential for cross-border payments and remittances. However, compliance risks remain a concern for startups, necessitating adaptation to remain competitive.

The growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) is poised to reshape traditional banking and crypto payroll solutions by minimizing the need for intermediaries, cutting costs, increasing transparency, and expediting peer-to-peer financial services. DeFi poses a challenge to traditional banks by offering decentralized alternatives for lending, payments, savings, and asset trading, often accompanied by lower fees and higher returns.

In terms of crypto payroll solutions, the influence of DeFi may manifest in:

Direct Crypto Payments: Payroll systems may pay employees directly in cryptocurrencies without intermediaries, expediting payments and cutting fees.

Smart Contract Automation: Payroll processes can be automated via smart contracts for timely and transparent disbursements.

Global Accessibility: DeFi payroll solutions enhance cross-border payments without traditional banking obstacles, benefiting remote and international workforces.

Integration Opportunities: Traditional payroll providers and banks may incorporate DeFi tools to create hybrid solutions that merge fiat payments with regulatory compliance and crypto payments.

The Ethereum ecosystem is filled with innovative projects, but seven tokens stand out as potential portfolio leaders for 2025: MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ether, Chainlink, Uniswap, Arbitrum, Aave, and Polygon. MAGACOIN FINANCE is the new entry, with its presale scarcity and predictions of 35x ROI making it a prime candidate for attention.

Meanwhile, Ethereum's established tokens — ETH, LINK, UNI, ARB, AAVE, and MATIC — continue to demonstrate their resilience through adoption and utility. As smart money shifts into Ethereum gems, the combination of established tokens and high-potential newcomers presents an enticing opportunity for investors looking to build positions ahead of the next major market movement.

To summarize, managing volatility effectively involves diversification, disciplined entry strategies like DCA, income generation through staking, active portfolio adjustments, and strong security—all tailored to include both established coins and promising new entrants like MAGACOIN FINANCE.

 Current age verification drives users to VPNs and sketchy sites. Blockchain can prove you're over 18 without exposing your identity to data breaches. 

Opinion by: Boris Bohrer-Bilowitzki, CEO of Concordium

The recent push to protect minors when it comes to adult content has been much needed. Having now taken effect in the UK, this ongoing movement is not slowing down, with other European markets and the US facing the same restrictions. 

As websites have instituted age verification software, however, problems have arisen. To avoid age verification, users either try to avoid the process or look for a less compliant provider. In either case, people are not adopting this new process, meaning minors are still at risk.

Existing protocols for identity verification are not up to standard. Adult users need to feel reassured that their identity is protected, while minors are prevented from having access. Processes like photo uploads or credit card checks are too outdated to work. Instead, there needs to be an approach that combines anonymity with a legitimate identity.

Recognizing the importance of laws like the Online Safety Act is essential. The reliance on the internet means inappropriate content is easily accessible to minors. With over 50% of children seeing harmful content online, governments must protect minors.

The challenge has come with implementation. The age verification in place has only led to users trying to circumvent the process. The 1,800% spike in VPN downloads only demonstrates that users of all ages are trying to avoid the verification process.

Related: ZKPs can prove I'm old enough without telling you my age

This helps no one. Websites can't guarantee minors aren't accessing their content, undermining online safety legislation. Meanwhile, as users avoid age verification through compliant sites, they are more likely to drift to less reputable providers, creating significant security and legal risk. 

Why are users avoiding verification software even if they are of the legal age? Fundamentally, it comes down to privacy. Adults will want to feel assured that their identity is protected. While existing age verification methods promise anonymity, the need for photos or credit card information can be a cause for concern.

Existing age verification processes are far too exposed to hacks, blackmail and scandal. Whether it's large retail chains or mobile phone providers, even the most robust systems can be at risk. With identity verification, adult content sites are now a massive target for cyberattacks. Even with the best protocols in place, it's only a matter of time until a site fails to stop an attack.

Here, the Web3 space can be the missing piece of the puzzle. There needs to be the right balance between privacy and identity verification to work. A blockchain system needs to maintain gated access without compromising user privacy. 

Achieving this requires users to verify their identity through a certified identity provider. That verified status is then cryptographically linked to their blockchain address — instead of the person's name or photo — via zero-knowledge proofs. This enables identity verification for multiple services without requiring third parties to access the data. 

Users can prove they're over 18 without revealing their identity to the site they're using. This approach goes beyond adult content and has a wide range of uses — from gambling to trade finance. Users are not sharing their personal data externally because the person's identity verification exists outside the blockchain. Identity verification is streamlined while reassuring users that their personal information is safe.

If needed, there are still protocols that can be in place to ensure that user identity is accessible. Should law enforcement need to, processes can be in place that can map the blockchain account back to the verified identity. This ensures that bad actors can be brought to justice in extreme cases. Using identity verification via a blockchain can strike a balance between privacy for the law-abiding and accountability for the malicious. 

Undoubtedly, age verification is needed in an age where ungated content is rife. Getting people to accept this new process will be challenging if it relies on outdated methods. Using the blockchain isn't about circumventing age verification or disagreeing with the broader issue of online safety. Instead, it's about establishing a better method that makes it easier for users to embrace this new requirement. 

If the current wave of regulation teaches us anything, digital anonymity and safety don't have to contradict each other. Maintaining both requires rethinking how identity works online, not as a surveillance tool, but as a selective, user-controlled signal. 

Achieving a better internet experience will require governments and businesses to move beyond checkbox compliance and start designing systems that reflect how people want to engage online: securely, privately and with agency.

- SWIFT tests XRP and HBAR for blockchain-based cross-border payments to boost efficiency and interoperability.

- XRP offers fast, low-energy transactions, while HBAR supports high throughput with strong governance.

- Trials align with ISO 20022 standards, signaling institutional blockchain adoption without replacing existing systems.

- Potential increased demand for these altcoins could reshape financial messaging and asset transfers.

SWIFT has initiated blockchain-based trials that integrate XRP and HBAR into its global financial messaging system, signaling a strategic move toward enhancing cross-border payment efficiency and digital asset interoperability. The trials aim to align blockchain technology with traditional financial infrastructure, particularly through the adoption of ISO 20022 standards, which are essential for modernizing financial messaging [1]. With over $150 trillion in annual transactions managed through its network, even a small shift toward blockchain could significantly increase demand for these altcoins [2].

XRP and HBAR are being evaluated for their ability to facilitate fast, scalable, and energy-efficient cross-border payments. XRP, known for its near-instant settlement times and strong banking sector support, processes approximately 1,500 transactions per second while consuming minimal energy [2]. Meanwhile, HBAR leverages a hashgraph consensus mechanism, enabling over 10,000 transactions per second with similarly low energy consumption and strong corporate governance [1]. Both assets are being tested for their potential to streamline asset transfers and support tokenization in a global financial context.

The trials represent a broader institutional acceptance of blockchain's role in financial systems. Unlike speculative narratives surrounding digital assets, SWIFT's approach emphasizes interoperability and incremental integration rather than outright replacement of existing infrastructure [1]. Analysts have noted that the trials could provide a framework for how blockchain-based solutions might complement traditional financial systems, particularly in terms of speed, governance, and standardization [2].

While SWIFT has not yet committed to long-term adoption of any specific blockchain technology, its active testing of multiple platforms reflects a recognition of the sector's evolution and the need for flexibility [1]. The potential adoption of ISO 20022 standards in the digital asset space could set new benchmarks for global interoperability, with XRP and HBAR serving as key indicators of how blockchain might reshape financial messaging and asset transfers.

The timing of these trials coincides with broader regulatory interest in digital currencies, such as Hong Kong's stablecoin sandbox and China's exploration of yuan-backed stablecoins [3]. However, these regional initiatives remain in early stages compared to SWIFT's more advanced, institutional-level testing.

SWIFT's blockchain trials underscore a cautious yet significant step toward bridging traditional finance with next-generation digital infrastructure. As the trials continue, the market will be watching closely for signs of long-term strategy, with XRP and HBAR positioned to benefit from increased institutional validation and standardization efforts [2].

Blockchain has long been criticised for its energy-intensive processes, particularly proof-of-work systems such as Bitcoin according to PwC.

But Algorand, a decentralised, open-source blockchain founded by MIT professor Silvio Micali, is challenging this narrative. 

Designed with scalability, security and decentralisation in mind, Algorand uses a unique consensus protocol called Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS). 

This approach delivers high performance while attempting to keep environmental impact low.

At the heart of Algorand's sustainability is its lottery-style Pure Proof-of-Stake mechanism. 

Unlike other proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains that require multiple blocks to confirm a transaction, Algorand finalises transactions with just one block. 

This efficiency is achieved through a Verifiable Random Function (VRF), which randomly selects validators for each block. 

The result is reduced energy use compared to networks like Ethereum or Solana, where validators must expend more computing power to achieve consensus.

Because Algorand's consensus relies on lightweight cryptographic sortition, validators do not compete constantly for block creation. 

""We're committed to an open, secure and inclusive blockchain ecosystem - and that requires clear, consistent policy,"" says Staci Warden, CEO of the Algorand Foundation.

""As the industry matures, it's more important than ever to ensure that policymakers understand the real-world impact of blockchain technology, from financial inclusion to decentralized identity.""

Running a node requires minimal hardware, reducing both computing demand and energy consumption. 

This ensures that decentralisation is not compromised in the pursuit of sustainability. 

Unlike delegated proof-of-stake systems such as EOS or Tron, which concentrate power among a small number of validators, Algorand aims to maintain a level playing field.

Algorand achieves instant finality, meaning transactions are confirmed and irreversible as soon as they are added to the blockchain. 

Its two-step filtering process, first rejecting invalid transactions and then rejecting invalid blocks, prevents wasted effort on transactions, ultimately minimising wasted energy consumption. 

In contrast, many PoS blockchains can rely on probabilistic validation that can lead to soft forks, resulting in wasted computational energy. 

Algorand ensures that every unit of energy contributes directly to useful work.

Scalability is often the missing piece in blockchain sustainability. 

A network may be energy efficient at low transaction volumes but struggle under higher demand. 

Algorand avoids this problem with its consensus system consuming only small amounts of energy even as throughput increases. 

This enables the platform to deliver high-speed finality, 100% uptime and strong performance without compromising its environmental commitments.

Beyond minimising its direct energy use, Algorand offsets its remaining emissions. 

Through partnerships with ClimateTrade, the Algorand Foundation has invested in projects ranging from thermal reduction in the United States to forest conservation initiatives in Brazil.

These efforts ensure the blockchain operates with a neutral carbon footprint, with all offsets recorded transparently on-chain.

Algorand's sustainability credentials extend beyond energy efficiency. 

The platform enables secure and scalable solutions for supply chain traceability.

Platforms such as Wholechain, built on Algorand, provide near real-time tracking of goods, verification of authenticity and compliance assurance. 

Other solutions within the Algorand ecosystem focus on carbon asset management (123Carbon) and global trade transparency (LW3 Pvt. Ltd.). 

These innovations help businesses reduce waste, combat fraud and strengthen accountability across complex supply chains.

By Isabella Flores

Key Takeaways:

Toyota, the world's largest automaker with over 10.8 million vehicle sales in 2024, is expanding its blockchain footprint. Through its R&D arm, Toyota Blockchain Lab, the company unveiled a new framework: Mobility Orchestration Network (MON), aimed at creating a trust-first digital layer for global mobility systems.



The mobility business is evolving at a tremendous rate. Electric vehicles (EVs), automated drivers and increasing costs are driving an industry rethink of how value is captured and shared, between car makers, insurers and regulators. The motive behind Toyota using blockchain is to bind what was once a shattered ecosystem together by using the lacking blockchain fabric of trust.

At the announcement date August 20, 2025, the prototype MON is conceptualized to mediate relations that support mobility ownership of vehicles, compliance with insurance, taxation, proof of safety audits, and operational data. Rather than treating cars as isolated objects, MON frames mobility as a network of verifiable relationships among multiple stakeholders.

This system is not just experimental. Toyota emphasizes MON as a response to three structural challenges in mobility:

Aiming to automate the interaction of vehicles and services, Toyota is targeting to digitalize the relationships through the implementation use of blockchain-ledger-based “Trust Chains: that minimize the use of paper-based procedures and unseen databases.



Toyota chose Avalanche (AVAX) as a blockchain, under which its “MON” will be built due to its low-latency consensus, multi-chain structure and in-built interoperability solutions. In contrast to the single-chain congestion model of Ethereum, Avalanche allows the creation of Layer-1 (L1) networks specific to use case needs.

For MON's prototype, Toyota outlined four interconnected L1s:

The design makes financial flows, operative data and regulatory proofs to be synchronized modular. These networks are connected via Interchain Messaging Protocol (ICM) created by Avalanche and allow secure, cross-chain messages and also atomic Delivery-vs-Payment (DvP) settlement.

Fundamentally, MON digitalizes the trust within the cars in three provable areas of proofs:

The aggregation of these proofs in a so-called Mobility Oriented Account (MOA). MON creates a vehicular identity that is native to a blockchain

To liberate finance, MON employs a “Fungibility Ladder”:

What this transformation means is that capital costs can be reduced by securitizing fleets of electric vehicles, robo-taxis, or logistics vehicles and then trading them in a straightforward and transparent way.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- Pudgy Penguins, once a leading NFT project, transformed into a multifaceted ecosystem after loyal holders acquired it for 750 ETH in 2021.

- The brand expanded globally via 3,000 Walmart stores in 2023, becoming the first NFT project to mass-produce physical toys linked to digital ownership.

- Its $1.4B airdrop of $PENGU token attracted 850,000 holders, marking the largest Solana-based token distribution and shifting its model to community-driven participation.

- Strategic partnerships with NASCAR, PEZ, and ETF campaigns, plus regulatory milestones like a 19b-4 ETF filing, solidified its mainstream cultural and financial influence.

Pudgy Penguins, the NFT project that once dominated the early 2021 NFT scene, has undergone a significant transformation, evolving from a digital collectible into a multifaceted ecosystem with physical products, social media influence, and a new digital token. In 2021, the project gained global attention, even securing a feature on the front page of the New York Times. However, it faced a decline in momentum due to internal issues and a broader market slowdown. A group of loyal holders, including CEO Luca Netz, acquired the project for 750 ETH in an effort to revitalize it [1]. Their strategy centered on the ""Penguin Proliferation Thesis,"" emphasizing the importance of character awareness and brand presence in mainstream culture. 

The project's resurgence began in October 2023 with the launch of Pudgy Toys in 3,000 Walmart stores, marking one of the largest retail activations for any consumer brand. This initiative was groundbreaking, as it was the first time physical products were created and licensed directly from NFT holders. Each toy included a QR code that unlocked access to Pudgy World, a digital experience for NFT creation and collection [1]. Following the Walmart launch, the toys expanded to over 10,000 retailers globally, including Target, Walgreens, and GameStop. The move into physical retail helped shift the brand from a niche NFT project to a mainstream consumer phenomenon.

Pudgy Penguins' expansion has extended beyond toys into entertainment, social content, and finance. A key development was the launch of $PENGU, the project's first social currency and token. Aimed at lowering the barrier to entry for new participants, $PENGU has attracted over 850,000 holders on decentralized exchanges and has been distributed through an airdrop worth $1.4 billion to over 6 million people. This airdrop is recognized as the eighth-largest in crypto history and the largest on the Solana blockchain [1]. The token is now listed on over 120 exchanges, including major platforms like Coinbase, Robinhood, and UpBit, transforming Pudgy Penguins from a brand-and-consumer model to a brand-and-participant model.

Pudgy Penguins has also made significant strides in social media and brand partnerships. The project has surpassed 5 million followers across all platforms and has exceeded 200 billion views for $PENGU on GIFs and social channels. Collaborations with major brands such as NASCAR and PEZ have further cemented its presence in mainstream culture. The project has also made headlines for its appearances in ETF commercials for VanEck and Bitwise. In addition, Pudgy Penguins became the second memecoin, after DOGE, to file a 19b-4 ETF with the SEC, a significant regulatory milestone [1].

The project has also expanded geographically, with notable ""takeover"" campaigns in Korea, Malaysia, and other Asian markets. These efforts highlight Pudgy Penguins' growing influence in international markets and its ability to adapt to diverse consumer bases. The project has also been at the forefront of government advisory initiatives, promoting the non-financial use cases of crypto [1]. As Pudgy Penguins continues to evolve, it aims to become the mascot for finance, a global franchise, and the top memecoin in the industry.

The Home Office could be banned from unlawfully using computer algorithms to recommend whether migrants should be deported.

Privacy International has filed a complaint to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) over the Home Office's collection and processing of information in immigration enforcement operations.

The move follows a successful complaint by the campaign group over the Home Office's use of GPS tagging to monitor asylum seekers.

The complaint filed on 18 August focuses on two algorithmic tools used for processing migrants' personal data, known as Identify and Prioritise Immigration Cases (IPIC) and Electronic Monitoring Review Tool (EMRT).

The campaign group claims in a 94-page legal submission that the Home Office is using the tools in a way that limits human involvement in decision-making, and that “design nudges” encourage case workers to accept the tool's recommendations with little scrutiny.

The complaint comes as public sector organisations adopt more automated tools to assist or replace human decision-making. Although such tools have the potential to improve accuracy and reduce costs, they are being routinely developed and operated behind closed doors with minimum transparency and safeguards, said Privacy International.

It said the IPIC and EMRT tools are “highly intrusive” and could be used to process sensitive data provided to the Home Office relating to an individual's health, family and other relationships, and potentially data obtained from GPS tracking. “Individuals are denied any meaningful information about how their data is used,” it said in the complaint.

The Identify and Prioritise Immigration Case (IPIC) tool is used for individuals who could be liable for detention or deportation from the UK. The tool prioritises casework for immigrant enforcement and makes automatic recommendations. IPIC uses various “business rules” to make recommendations related to decisions on whether to detain and remove migrants without immigration status or to deny them access to services and benefits.

The Electronic Monitoring Review Tool (EMRT) generates recommendations that relate to the use of GPS ankle tracking as a condition of immigration bail. The tool is used by the Home Office during quarterly Electronic Monitoring (EM) reviews to decide whether GPS tracking remains appropriate. The EMRT uses an automated “harm score” to determine the minimum period an individual will remain subject to a GPS ankle tag. The tool generates automatic recommendations on whether a person should remain on an ankle bracelet or be transitioned to a non-fitted device, which requires people to submit biometric information several times a day.

Source: Privacy International complaint

According to Home Office figures, the EMRT tool was used to conduct more than 1,700 quarterly Electronic Monitoring (EM) reviews over an 80-day period in 2023. It is likely that both tools have been used to make recommendations on tens of thousands of data subjects, according to estimates by Privacy International.

“The potential harms arising from tools used across the immigration system at such scale include the potential for vulnerable individuals to be subjected to life-changing decisions. This may include detention or removal from the UK based on profiling and automated decision-making,” it said.

This means there is no way to verify the lawfulness and accuracy of processing or to challenge decisions, Privacy International claimed, arguing that the Home Office's use of the algorithms breaches the UK General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018.

“Individuals lack any meaningful information about how their data is used, and where information is provided, it is inconsistent and contradictory,” Privacy International said in a statement.

“No coherent and comprehensive information is provided to migrants concerning what information the tools process and how it is used, including what consequences their deployment could have on decisions that may impact their lives,” it added.

Privacy International has asked the information commissioner to issue an enforcement notice to prevent the Home Office from collecting and processing personal data using the IPIC and EMRT tools in immigrant enforcement operations.

“These tools appear to have been deployed without sufficient safeguards to protect those subject to them, raising concerns as to whether the Home Office is adequately complying with laws regulating the processing of personal data in the UK,” it said.

A previous complaint by the group prompted the ICO to issue a formal warning to the Home Office over its use of GPS ankle tags to monitor the location and movement of asylum seekers who arrive in the UK on small boats and other unauthorised routes.

The ICO found the Home Office had failed to assess the intrusive impact of continuously collecting people's location data and its potential impact on people who may be vulnerable because of their asylum status, their inability to speak English, or because they had faced difficult conditions travelling to the UK.

The Home Office has been approached for comment.

- Remittix (RTX) ICO nears $21M as Solana whales and institutional investors drive fundraising momentum.

- Project offers cross-border remittances in 30+ countries, with CertiK-audited infrastructure and Q3 beta wallet launch planned.

- 611M tokens sold and BitMart listing boost visibility, though 1,000% price projections remain speculative.

- Whale activity and low gas fees on Solana ($180.74) sustain interest despite recent 10.49% price drop.

The crypto market is witnessing a surge of interest in the Remittix (RTX) initial coin offering (ICO) as Solana whales and institutional investors continue to pour capital into the project. With the presale nearing $21 million raised, the project is gaining traction for its payments-focused model and real-world utility in cross-border remittances. At a price of $0.0969 per token, Remittix is positioning itself as one of the most promising presales of 2025, drawing comparisons with top-performing altcoins [1].

The project is set to launch its beta wallet in Q3, a key step toward establishing itself in the global payments sector. The wallet will include real-time foreign exchange conversions and is expected to enhance the token's appeal to everyday users. Additionally, the platform has already been audited by CertiK, a move that bolsters trust and transparency in the project's infrastructure [1].

One of the most notable aspects of Remittix is its ability to facilitate crypto-to-fiat transfers in over 30 countries, making it a compelling solution for international money transfers. This utility, combined with the low gas fees and high scalability of the Solana blockchain, has made RTX an attractive investment for those seeking exposure to a project with tangible use cases [1].

The momentum behind the ICO has also been driven by the project's fundraising progress. With over 611 million tokens sold and a $250,000 ongoing giveaway to incentivize community participation, the project has demonstrated strong early-stage adoption. The first centralized exchange listing on BitMart has further contributed to the project's visibility and liquidity [1].

Despite the enthusiasm, it is important to note that the projected 1,000% price increase is not a formal forecast by any analyst but rather speculative commentary based on the speed of fundraising and whale activity. The actual token's performance will depend on post-ICO adoption, regulatory developments, and broader market conditions [1].

As the project moves closer to its next fundraising milestone of $22 million, the anticipation for the next listing announcement continues to build. Solana's current market position—trading at $180.74 with a 10.49% drop in the last 24 hours—has not dampened interest in new projects like Remittix, which are seen as potential breakout candidates in 2025 [1].

China has been expanding use of digital currencies as it promotes wider use of its yuan, or renminbi, to reflect its status as the world's second-largest economy

BANGKOK -- China has been expanding use of digital currencies as it promotes wider use of its yuan, or renminbi, to reflect its status as the world's second-largest economy and challenge the overwhelming sway of the U.S. dollar in international trade and finance. 

However, restrictions on access to Chinese financial markets and limits on convertibility of the yuan, or “people's money,” are big obstacles blocking its global use. 

Still, Hong Kong already has stablecoin regulations and some Chinese experts are pushing for regulations to prepare for a possible stablecoin pegged to the yuan. 

Officials at the People's Bank of China and State Council Information Office in Beijing did not immediately respond to requests for comment on a Reuters report that the State Council, or Cabinet, is preparing to issue a plan for internationalizing the yuan that might include a yuan stablecoin. 

In the U.S., President Donald Trump has made cryptofriendly policies a priority for his administration. He signed a law, the GENIUS Act, last month regulating stablecoins. 

Stablecoins are digital currencies whose value is linked to a specific currency such as the U.S. dollar. They can be used as a substitute in situations where currency transactions might be difficult or costly. They are different from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in that their only purpose is to be a means of payment, not an investment meant to be traded to gain value. 

Dollar stablecoins are typically bought and sold for $1 each. They are based on a reserve equal to their value, but are issued by private institutions, not central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve. 

Stablecoins are not Digital Central Bank Currencies, which are digital versions of currencies issued by central banks. They are based on blockchain-based distributed ledgers. They are “stable” in the sense that their value is anchored to the currency they are based on. 

Critics of stablecoins say that since they are essentially a proxy for ordinary currencies that can bypass banking systems and safeguards set up to manage traditional financial transactions they may be most useful for illegal purposes. 

China launched its own digital yuan, the e-CNY issued by its central bank, on a trial basis in 2019, and McDonalds was an early participant in that project. Chinese regulators have banned mining, trading and other dealings in private, decentralized digital currencies like Bitcoin, while encouraging use of the digital yuan. 

The nearly universal use of electronic payments has facilitated use of the e-CNY in the Chinese mainland, with some cities using it to pay wages of civil servants. State media reported that as of July 2024, there were 7.3 trillion yuan worth of transactions using the currency in areas where it is being used on a trial basis. 

China has also been promoting use of e-CNY in Africa, as it expands business dealings on the continent. 

But e-CNY are not stablecoins. Experts say regulations are needed to safely manage use of stablecoins and to ensure they could be used smoothly with bank accounts and payment systems. 

Hong Kong, a former British colony that has its own financial markets, currency and partly autonomous legal system, enacted a stablecoin law that took effect on Aug. 1. 

Aimed at attracting wealthy investors who want to use digital currencies and other financial products, it requires that a stablecoin linked to the Hong Kong dollar must be equal to the Hong Kong dollar reserves for that digital currency.

As a global duty-free port and financial hub, Hong Kong has often served as a base for trying out paths toward liberalizing Chinese financial markets. But new regulations specifically governing yuan stablecoin would be needed if such a digital currency were issued for use in Hong Kong, Liu Xiaochun, deputy director of the Shanghai Institute of New Finance, recently wrote in a report on the Chinese financial website Yicai.com. 

China's currency is not freely convertible in world financial markets and its stringent controls on foreign exchange are the biggest hindrance toward making the yuan a global currency, experts say. 

According to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, as of June, the yuan was the sixth most active currency for global payments by value, with a share of 2.88%. Its use peaked in July 2024 at about 4.7%.

It's used more often in trade financing, where it accounts for nearly 6% of such dealings, according to that report. 

The lion's share of yuan transactions take place in Hong Kong. 

The U.S. dollar's share as a global payment currency was over 47% as of June, followed by the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Japanese yen, the report said.

MetaMask USD, or mUSD, is being rolled out in conjunction with Stripe-owned stablecoin issuance platform Bridge, Stripe's stablecoin division, and M0, a decentralized stablecoin infrastructure and liquidity platform, according to a Thursday (Aug. 21) press release.

“Issuing a custom stablecoin used to take more than a year of complex integrations,” Bridge co-founder and CEO Zach Abrams said in the release. “With our issuance technology, we've reduced that timeline to a matter of weeks, which means platforms like MetaMask can realize benefits more rapidly and efficiently than ever before.”

MetaMask USD will be integrated into MetaMask's wallet, letting users hold, spend and transact stablecoins in Web3, with the M0 liquidity network allowing for composable cross-chain use, the release said.

“We want to empower the builders of great crypto products to truly control the digital dollar stack they utilize in order to deliver the best end-user experience,” M0 co-founder and CEO Luca Prosperi said in the release. “The current incarnation of stablecoin technology isn't fit for that purpose. Products such as MetaMask benefit from being able to customize the stablecoin technology, from having choice over their issuance options, and from optimizing for interoperability and liquidity.”

The launch puts MetaMask in the company of several other firms launching their own stablecoins as the digital currency grows more popular in the United States, especially in the wake of new legislation governing its use.

These digital tokens, pegged to national currencies like the U.S. dollar, have evolved rapidly since their early use in crypto trading. They now command a sizable global market and have become, in some regions, crucial to cross-border remittances and B2B payments. However, domestic retail adoption has been limited, especially when it comes to retail use cases.

“The crypto market cap is $3 trillion, and the stablecoin market cap is $250 billion, meaning it's less than 10%,” Mesh CEO and co-founder Bam Azizi told PYMNTS earlier this summer. “If you want to build a payments network, you need to solve the divide so shoppers can walk in and pay with their assets, while merchants receive the payment as stablecoin.”

This week, PYMNTS examined the compliance question surrounding stablecoins, which are challenged to balance privacy, compliance and speed.

- SWIFT tests XRP and HBAR for blockchain-based cross-border payments to boost efficiency and interoperability.

- XRP offers fast, low-energy transactions, while HBAR supports high throughput with strong governance.

- Trials align with ISO 20022 standards, signaling institutional blockchain adoption without replacing existing systems.

- Potential increased demand for these altcoins could reshape financial messaging and asset transfers.

SWIFT has initiated blockchain-based trials that integrate XRP and HBAR into its global financial messaging system, signaling a strategic move toward enhancing cross-border payment efficiency and digital asset interoperability. The trials aim to align blockchain technology with traditional financial infrastructure, particularly through the adoption of ISO 20022 standards, which are essential for modernizing financial messaging [1]. With over $150 trillion in annual transactions managed through its network, even a small shift toward blockchain could significantly increase demand for these altcoins [2].

XRP and HBAR are being evaluated for their ability to facilitate fast, scalable, and energy-efficient cross-border payments. XRP, known for its near-instant settlement times and strong banking sector support, processes approximately 1,500 transactions per second while consuming minimal energy [2]. Meanwhile, HBAR leverages a hashgraph consensus mechanism, enabling over 10,000 transactions per second with similarly low energy consumption and strong corporate governance [1]. Both assets are being tested for their potential to streamline asset transfers and support tokenization in a global financial context.

The trials represent a broader institutional acceptance of blockchain's role in financial systems. Unlike speculative narratives surrounding digital assets, SWIFT's approach emphasizes interoperability and incremental integration rather than outright replacement of existing infrastructure [1]. Analysts have noted that the trials could provide a framework for how blockchain-based solutions might complement traditional financial systems, particularly in terms of speed, governance, and standardization [2].

While SWIFT has not yet committed to long-term adoption of any specific blockchain technology, its active testing of multiple platforms reflects a recognition of the sector's evolution and the need for flexibility [1]. The potential adoption of ISO 20022 standards in the digital asset space could set new benchmarks for global interoperability, with XRP and HBAR serving as key indicators of how blockchain might reshape financial messaging and asset transfers.

The timing of these trials coincides with broader regulatory interest in digital currencies, such as Hong Kong's stablecoin sandbox and China's exploration of yuan-backed stablecoins [3]. However, these regional initiatives remain in early stages compared to SWIFT's more advanced, institutional-level testing.

SWIFT's blockchain trials underscore a cautious yet significant step toward bridging traditional finance with next-generation digital infrastructure.

The Federal Reserve has begun “technical research” on financial technology, including tokenization and AI in payments, said Christopher Waller, a Fed member and reportedly a candidate for chairman.

The Federal Reserve could benefit from deeper engagement with payments industry “innovators” to better understand new trends and technologies, especially as the use of digital assets grows, Fed Gov. Christopher Waller said Wednesday.

The Fed is conducting “technical research” to explore innovations that include tokenization, smart contracts, and artificial intelligence in payments, he said in a speech at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium.

“It is my belief that the Federal Reserve could benefit from further engagement with innovators in industry, particularly as there is increased convergence between the traditional financial sector and the digital asset ecosystem,” Waller said. “We are working on ways to further that engagement, so stay tuned.”

The Fed must understand “whether emerging technologies could provide opportunities to improve our existing platforms and services,” he said in the speech, titled “Technological Advancements in Payments.”

The Federal Reserve is deeply involved in the payments industry, operating the FedNow real-time payments service since July 2023, with about 1,400 participating financial institutions and $2.7 billion in daily transactions, according to a FedNow fact sheet from last month. 

It also manages the Fedwire Funds Service and its regional bank system acts as an operator, along with The Clearing House, for ACH payments.

President Donald Trump nominated Waller, a former research director for the St. Louis Fed, for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 2020 during Trump's first term. Waller has emerged among Trump advisers as the leading candidate to be the next Fed chairman, Bloomberg News reported Aug. 7, citing people familiar with the discussions. 

Waller said the payments industry is undergoing a “technology-driven revolution,” citing instant payments settled continuously, digital wallets, mobile payment apps, stablecoins and other digital assets, alongside artificial intelligence advances.

“While there has been a lot of excitement, and admittedly sometimes hype, around the possibilities of these new technologies, there have also been some who have been fearful or skeptical of innovation in this space,” he said. “But we only have to look to history to see that the evolution of the payment system has long been a story of technological advancement.”

Waller also noted the significance of stablecoins, and the enactment last month of the U.S. Genius Act, to provide a regulatory framework for that cryptocurrency. The law “could help stablecoins reach their full potential,” he said.

Stablecoins provide a way to access and store U.S. dollars, he noted. “In fact, I believe that stablecoins have the potential to maintain and extend the role of the dollar internationally,” Waller said, also noting their potential role in retail and cross-border payments. 

Despite Trump's general support for stablecoins and cryptocurrencies, he signed a financial technology executive order in January that specifically precludes the Fed, or any part of the federal government, from issuing a central bank digital currency. During the Biden administration, the Fed produced a 2022 report on the possibility of issuing a CBDC, prompting a flood of feedback.

At the Fed, Waller has taken a keen interest in payments, benefiting from his experience as an academic, including as the chair of the economics department at the University of Notre Dame as well as the chair of the macroeconomics and monetary economics department at the University of Kentucky. In addition, he was a research fellow at the University of Bonn in Germany.

Trump has repeatedly denigrated Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in recent months over the Fed's decision not to cut interest rates, and has suggested he could dismiss Powell before the chair's current term ends in May. 

At the Fed's last meeting July 30, Waller and Fed Gov. Michelle Bowman, who was appointed by Trump in 2018, dissented when the Fed opted not to cut its target range for rates.

WEATHER ALERT

FLAGLER COUNTY, Fla. – The Flagler County Sheriff's Office Cybercrimes Unit has made history.

For the first time, the unit recovered thousands of dollars in stolen cryptocurrency for fraud victims.

Crypto is notoriously difficult to recover because the transactions move quickly and often involve international exchanges.

[EXCLUSIVE: Become a News 6 Insider (it's FREE) | PINIT! Share your photos]

This breakthrough marks a significant step forward in the fight against crypto scams, which have often left victims without recourse.

Victims like Cindy Burns, from Orange County, who lost $15,000 after a bank impersonator convinced her to convert funds to crypto. 

She said she felt “completely violated.”

Elizabeth Bahmann who lives in Ormond Beach told News 6 losing $90,000 took an emotional toll on her. “I was close to taking my life,” she said.

Brandon Paige of Orlando lost nearly $600,000 when his crypto hardware wallet was hacked.

“It's stressful to know that you took a blow like that,” he said. “It's very significant.”

None of these victims have recovered their money.

Detective John Hill leads the Flagler County Sheriff's Office cyber-crimes unit.

Hill explained how the department used a program called T-R-M to trace cryptocurrency transactions through the blockchain, allowing them to follow the money to its destination.

Few Central Florida law enforcement agencies have the technology.

“A lot of times previously we'd have to say, ‘I'm so sorry for your losses',” Hill said when telling victims in the past they couldn't do much about crypto scams.

With this new technology, the department was able to recover $15,000 in one case and $4,000 in another.

Hill called it “a great feeling” and “a little bit of justice for the victims.”

When Hill located the account where his victim's money landed, after securing a subpoena, he recovered the funds. 

The victims lost $19,000, but there was nearly $50,000 in the account.

“All of that money is considered ‘dirty' money,” Hill said. “I'm not going to give a scammer his money back.”

With the remaining cash, Hill is looking for other victims who may be connected to his two cases, so he can return their money to them, even if they are in other jurisdictions.

Hill emphasized that T-R-M is a game changer, giving law enforcement the tools needed to advance investigations into cryptocurrency fraud.

If you have been the victim of a crypto scam and think your case could be connected, contact the Flagler County Sheriff's Office.

If you fall victim, keep any wallet addresses you have and report it immediately.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","New Crypto Advocacy Group Launches in Wyoming","https://www.blockchain-council.org/cryptocurrency/new-crypto-advocacy-group-launches-in-wyoming/","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 12:07:05 GMT","

A new nonprofit called the American Innovation Project (AIP) has launched in Wyoming. Its purpose is simple: to educate U.S. lawmakers about blockchain, digital assets, and artificial intelligence while encouraging bipartisan cooperation. The group was introduced at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium in Jackson Hole, a major gathering point for both policymakers and industry leaders.

The launch of AIP reflects a broader trend. Crypto is no longer just about technology and markets. It is about regulation, education, and shaping policy. For anyone looking to build expertise in how this industry interacts with governance, a Crypto certification can help bridge that gap between innovation and policymaking.

AIP is set up as a nonpartisan 501(c)(3). This gives it the ability to focus on education without being tied to party politics. Its board includes respected figures from across the industry. Leaders from the Solana Policy Institute, Blockchain Association, Paradigm, Digital Currency Group, and Coinbase are all involved in guiding its mission.

Funding support comes from some of the largest names in crypto and venture capital. Digital Currency Group pledged $1 million to the project. Other key backers include Andreessen Horowitz, Kraken, Uniswap Labs, and Stand With Crypto, alongside the Cedar Innovation Foundation.

The main goal of AIP is to create a forum where lawmakers can learn about blockchain and related technologies without the usual political divides. By giving Congress and regulators access to expertise, the group hopes to improve how policies are written and reduce misunderstandings that often slow down innovation.

This move also shows that the industry wants to play a proactive role in shaping rules. Instead of waiting for regulations and then reacting, groups like AIP are trying to build long-term dialogue between developers, investors, and policymakers.

AIP was introduced at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium in Jackson Hole. The event was designed to bring together voices from both finance and technology. It also coincided with the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, the Federal Reserve's major annual policy event.

The launch included private discussions and off-the-record summits. These allowed industry figures to meet directly with lawmakers and regulators in an environment focused on collaboration.

Lawmakers were active participants. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott discussed an upcoming bill focused on crypto market structure. Former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins spoke about new ways to regulate digital tokens without stifling innovation.

The American Innovation Project is not the only group working in this space. It joins other advocacy efforts that have gained traction since pro-crypto lawmakers won more seats in 2024. These include:

Together, these groups show a coordinated push from the industry to make sure that U.S. policies reflect the realities of blockchain development and adoption.

By setting up in Wyoming, AIP also highlights the state's role as a hub for blockchain innovation. Wyoming has already passed more than 45 crypto-related laws and was the first state to approve a state-issued stablecoin. Hosting the launch here reinforces the state's reputation as a leader in forward-looking regulation.

For the industry, AIP's debut shows that education is now seen as critical. Policymakers are often unfamiliar with the details of blockchain. By providing accessible resources, the group could help shape rules that balance innovation with consumer protection.

The creation of AIP reflects the growing understanding that crypto cannot succeed on technology alone. Without regulatory clarity, businesses face uncertainty. By building educational resources and encouraging collaboration, AIP may help speed up the process of creating fair and workable rules.

If you are working in blockchain, finance, or policy, AIP's work could affect how projects operate in the U.S. It may change compliance requirements, create new opportunities, or influence where companies decide to set up.

For analysts and developers, understanding the policy environment is just as important as knowing the technology. A Data Science Certification can give you tools to measure how regulatory shifts affect adoption and markets.

For business leaders, being able to position products in a landscape shaped by both innovation and regulation is key. A Marketing and Business Certification can prepare you to guide teams through these changes.

The launch of the American Innovation Project in Wyoming marks a new stage in how the crypto industry engages with the government. By focusing on education and bipartisan cooperation, the group aims to shape rules that encourage innovation while addressing policymakers' concerns.

As crypto matures, groups like AIP will play a central role in how the industry is understood and regulated. For professionals and businesses, this signals the importance of not just following the technology but also paying close attention to the policies that will define its future.

Markets are quickly recalibrating previously lofty odds of an imminent rate cut as the jets touch down in Jackson Hole for the Kansas City Fed's Economic Symposium.

The current data does not make the case for a September ease, said Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, speaking with Yahoo News in Wyoming.

""We have inflation that's too high and has been trending upwards over the past year,"" she said. ""If the meeting was tomorrow, I would not see a case for reducing interest rates.""

She further argued that inflation numbers are only beginning to show the impact of tariffs and that the full effect wouldn't be seen until next year.

Hammack's comments are notable, showing Fed Chair Jerome Powell continues to have plenty of support in his hawkish stance despite two dissident dovish votes at the last central bank policy meeting and President Trump's continuing campaign for lower rates.

Her remarks also come after a series of potential Powell replacements appeared on the airwaves in recent days to argue for sharply lower interest rates. The latest this morning was former St. Louis Fed boss Jim Bullard, who argued for policy rates 100 basis points below the current level.

Just one week ago, bitcoin touched a record high above $124,000 alongside a nearly 100% expectation that the Fed would trim rates next month. Seven days later, those odds have slipped back to 71%, according to CME FedWatch and bitcoin BTC$112,323.17 has plunged nearly 10% to the current $112,800.

Markets will get to hear from Powell himself at his keynote address on Friday morning and at this point it's nearly certain he'll not turn dove. Instead, he's likely to emphasize that inflation continues to remain too hot and thus the need to take a wait and see approach towards adjusting monetary policy.

Bank of America's (BAC) rates strategy team said the U.S. Treasury market is increasingly shaped by two emerging forces: stablecoin demand for T-bills and the tokenization of government debt-related assets. 

BofA views stablecoins as less of a game-changer for Treasuries than for money market mutual funds (MMFs), where their higher-yield potential represents a competitive challenge, the Wall Street bank said in a report Monday.

The bank's analysts expects stablecoin demand for Treasury bills to grow gradually, in the order of $25 billion to $75 billion over the next 12 months, but not enough to meaningfully shift bill market dynamics.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold. They play a major role in cryptocurrency markets, providing among other things a payment infrastructure, and are also used to transfer money internationally.

According to BofA, some MMF clients are showing increased interest in tokenization, viewing it as a defensive move against stablecoins. 

The report noted that in July, BNY Mellon (BK), alongside Goldman Sachs (GS), rolled out blockchain-based technology to maintain records of ownership in select MMF shares. 

The effort, spurred in part by stablecoin growth and the GENIUS Act, marked the first rollover of tokenized MMF shares.

With stablecoins currently restricted from paying yield, money market funds see a narrow window to tokenize and offer competitive rates before regulatory changes or workarounds erode that advantage, the report added.

 Several well-known traders have bought the newly launched token promoted by rapper Kanye West, which pumped to over $3 billion but has since fallen back. 

Rapper Kanye West's newly launched YZY token on Solana rocketed up to $3 billion in value just 40 minutes after its launch, but concerns over insider sales dented a large portion of the gains. 

In a Thursday X post, West, who officially goes by Ye, shared the contract address along with the website for Yeezy Money, which he describes as “A NEW ECONOMY, BUILT ON CHAIN.”

The website describes YZY as a currency to power transactions within “YZY MONEY,” a ”financial system built on crypto rails.”  

In a later post, West was seen saying, “the official YZY token just dropped.”

Within 40 minutes, the YZY token hit a market capitalization of $3 billion, but it fell to about $1.05 billion at the time of writing, according to data analytics platform Nansen.

In the website's fine print, it is mentioned that the token is not available to entities in restricted jurisdictions. It also warns users about the risks associated with digital assets, including a “potential for complete loss.”

One user shared a screenshot where West had warned users in February that he was asked to promote a fake currency for $2 million, which would have involved him faking his account being hacked after promoting the token.

At the time of writing, West's net worth was estimated at $400 million, according to Forbes.

The Yeezy Money website said that it deployed 25 contract addresses for the YZY token, with one selected at random to be the official token in order to discourage token snipers. 

Still, the YZY token launch has raised suspicions over insider trading, similar to other celebrity memecoins.

Onchain analytics platform Lookonchain said that only YZY tokens were added to the liquidity pool, which meant that the developers could sell the tokens at any time they liked by modifying the liquidity of the pool.

Conor Grogan, a director at Coinbase, pointed out that at least 94% of the token supply was held by insiders, with one single multisig wallet holding 87% of the supply before it was distributed to multiple wallets.

One user who allegedly had insider knowledge mistakenly bought the wrong token, which caused them to lose $710,000; however, they recovered their losses by later purchasing the correct token, Lookonchain said.

Another user profited $3.4 million, paying $24,000 in priority fees to the Solana network to ensure the transaction was processed as fast as possible.

Onchain Lens noted that an entity that bought the token early on sat at a profit of $6 million when the token peaked.

Despite the concerns, several well-known crypto traders said they bought the token. 

Leverage trader James Wynn said that whales would likely be attracted to the token due to its liquidity and volume.

Wynn said that it is a short-term play, and that he is looking to double or quadruple the amount he has poured into the token. The trader cited President Donald Trump's eponymous memecoin that quadrupled in 28 hours as his reason behind the investment.

“Aped $YZY on a 60% pull back. $TRUMP ran from $4bn to $15bn in 28 hours. 4x” Wynn mentioned.

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes also appears to have bought the token.

Celebrity mememcoins got a lot of attention this year, with Argentina's President Javier Milei's support of the LIBRA token seen as one of the more controversial.

In February, the Argentine president shared the LIBRA token on X, which caused the token to soar to a market capitalization of $4 billion; however, he deleted the post hours after facing backlash from the community, which brought the token price crashing down.

The incident caused outrage, with many calling for strict restrictions to be placed on memecoins promoted by politicians.

Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump launched the TRUMP memecoin ahead of his presidential inauguration.

 The Trump family DeFi project minted $205 million USD1, pushing its treasury holdings and the stablecoin supply to record highs. 

The Trump family's decentralized finance project, World Liberty Financial, minted more than $200 million worth of its stablecoin hours after a speech by Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, praising stablecoins. 

World Liberty posted to X on Thursday that it minted $205 million worth of the platform's stablecoin, USD1, for its treasury, boosting its supply to a record high of $2.4 billion in the token's first significant increase since late April.

Since it was launched in early April, the Trump family-backed stablecoin has become the world's sixth-largest in terms of market capitalization, led by Tether's $167 billion-strong Tether (USDT) with a 60% market share, followed by Circle Internet Group's $67.4 billion USDC (USDC) with a 24% share.

The USD1 mint came just hours after the Fed's Waller made a pro-crypto speech that specifically touted stablecoins. 

“I believe that stablecoins have the potential to maintain and extend the role of the dollar internationally,” Waller said on Wednesday at a blockchain conference in Wyoming.

“Stablecoins also have the potential to improve retail and cross-border payments,” he added.

Waller said the stablecoin-regulating GENIUS Act signed into law last month was “an important step for the payment stablecoin market and could help stablecoins reach their full potential.”  

It echoed comments from Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins, who said on Aug. 19 that the bill is a “seminal step for the US Congress and government.”

The recent USD1 mint has boosted the WLFI treasury holdings to a record $548 million, according to Nansen.

The stablecoin is now World Liberty's largest crypto holding at $212 million and 39% of its total portfolio. Aave Ethereum USDT (AETHUSDT) is the project's next biggest investment at $85 million, along with an equal value share of Ether (ETH), as the project holds 19,650 ETH. 

Earlier this month, it was reported that World Liberty Financial was exploring the creation of a publicly traded company to hold its WLFI tokens, with a fundraising target of around $1.5 billion.

Always give your crustaceans a once-over with your handy Geiger counter.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Finding radiation in human food can be a pretty natural phenomenon. Bananas, for example, is technically radioactive, as it contains the naturally occurring isotope potassium-40. Luckily, this radiation is not cumulative, and the isotope is typically excreted to maintain the body's homeostasis. In fact, this is such a well-known source of agriculture radiation that scientists have informally labeled safe radiation levels as “banana equivalent dose” (or BED) for decades.

Other times, however, radiation can enter the food supply in ways that are less than natural. 

Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an alert that frozen shrimp originating from Indonesia—specifically from a company operating under PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati, or BMS Foods—tested positive for unsafe levels of the radioactive isotope cesium-137. This is the most common isotope of cesium, and is used in a variety of industrial gauges, Geiger-Muller counters, and radiation therapy devices. But it's also a byproduct of nuclear fission, and traces of the isotope remain in the environment due to past nuclear weapons testing. The 1986 Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster, for instance, caused widespread distribution of cesium-137 throughout Europe. 

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that the isotope is so common that people are actually exposed to it every day at safe levels. However, if you were to ingest a particular package of shrimp sold at Walmart in several (mostly southern) U.S. states—including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, and West Virginia—you'd likely exceed those safe levels after repeated exposure. The FDA is advising customers to throw away any Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp with the expiration date of 3/15/2027. 

Although there's been no confirmation of radiation risk in food purchased at Walmart stores, the FDA said that it has detected unsafe levels of cesium-137 contamination at four U.S. ports. This contamination likely suggests that the shrimp was packaged in unsanitary conditions. 

“FDA has not detected Cs-137 in any product above the current derived intervention levels for Cs-137 (1200 Bq/kg),” the agency wrote. “However, FDA has concluded that the level detected in the breaded shrimp sample could represent a potential health concern for those exposed to this level of Cs-137 from consumption of the shrimp over an extended period of time combined with radiation that exists in the environment and from other sources such as medical procedures.”

Exposure to large amounts of cesium-137 can cause severe burns, radiation sickness, and even death. While exposure to low-level radiation isn't nearly as dire, it's not an experience you want to repeat over a long period of time. According to the CDC, the ingestion or inhalation of cesium-137 can distribute the radioactive material to soft tissues, such as muscles. This exposes them to both beta and gamma radiation that can increase cancer risk.

In other words, a bit bigger deal than eating a banana.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Scientists Think the Weird Physics of Blood Could Crack Murder Cases Wide Open","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a65821542/bloodstain-physics/","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

The ways that a bloodstain behaves could point out the speed and angle at which blood splattered onto a fabric, a helpful tool for forensic investigators.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In film, a splotch of crimson blood hitting a white square of cotton is often visual shorthand for “this is not good.” Obviously, in real life, bloodstains aren't usually positive omens either, but it turns out that they may at least be helpful. 

In a new study published in the journal Forensic Science International, a team of North Carolina State University researchers analyzed the dynamics of blood droplets falling on three different types of cotton fabrics. The goal was to work backwards from a bloodstain to the splatter of blood that created it, all by better understanding how the blood behaves when it hits fabric. The hope is that the work could be helpful in forensic investigations.

“When blood strikes fabric, it leaves a stain,” Tiegang Fang, one of the authors of the study, said in a statement. “But it can be difficult to accurately assess things like how quickly blood was traveling when it struck the fabric. Was it going fast? Slow? Did someone just brush up against the blood? It's hard to tell, because once the blood comes into contact with the fabric, it wicks across the surface of the fibers in the fabric, spreading out.” 

Five fabric surfaces were analyzed throughout the study—plain-woven cotton (which has the same surface characteristics on both the front and back), the front and back of cotton twill, and the front and back of jersey knit. Once the fabrics had been selected, the team applied pig blood (treated to ensure consistent behavior across testing) to the materials at 12 different velocities. High-speed cameras—using a rate of four frames per millisecond—captured the blood strikes and documented how the blood traveled across the fabrics after making contact. By analyzing the images, the team identified patterns in the bloodstains correlating to the velocity of the blood splatter.

“One key finding relates to the ‘fingers' of the blood stain,” Fang said. “When you look at a bloodstain on fabric, you will sometimes see thin tendrils that spread out from the center of the stain. Those tendrils are referred to as fingers. We found that the more fingers a bloodstain has, the faster the blood was moving when it struck the fabric. However, over time, these fingers may spread out and run together.” 

Additionally, the faster the blood was traveling when it hit the fabric, the more likely it was that there would be additional tiny stains—known as satellite droplets—surrounding a central stain. 

The study text noted that when blood drops hit a fabric, they spread and form rims. Then, the rim breaks up and retracts, allowing the blood to enter the inter-yarn spaces in the fabric structure and stop acting like an independent droplet. From there, blood starts spreading within the fabric and begins wicking across the surface.

But not every fabric behaved the same. Researchers concluded that plain-woven cotton provided the most clues regarding estimated velocity, largely because the stains were the biggest. Conversely, twill was the trickiest to understand, and knit offered the smallest stains up for analysis. 

Fang called the results of the study “promising,” and plans additional research with a wider variety of fabrics, weaves, and yarns. “It's clear,” he said, “that the specific structures of each surface play a critical role in how these bloodstains form and what we can learn from them.”

An international team of scientists, led by Northwestern University astrophysicists, has detected a never-before-seen type of exploding star, or supernova, that is rich with silicon, sulfur and argon.

When massive stars explode, astrophysicists typically find strong signatures of light elements, such as hydrogen and helium. But the newly discovered supernova, dubbed SN2021yfj, displayed a startling different chemical signature.

Astronomers long have theorized that massive stars have a layered structure, similar to an onion. The outermost layers predominantly comprise the lightest elements. As the layers move inward, the elements become heavier and heavier until reaching the innermost iron core.

The observations of SN2021yfj suggest the massive star somehow lost its outer hydrogen, helium and carbon layers -- exposing the inner silicon and sulfur-rich layers -- before exploding. This finding offers direct evidence of the long-theorized inner layered structure of stellar giants and provides an unprecedented glimpse inside a massive star's deep interior -- moments before its explosive death.

The study was published on Aug. 20 in the journal Nature.

""This is the first time we have seen a star that was essentially stripped to the bone,"" said Northwestern's Steve Schulze, who led the study. ""It shows us how stars are structured and proves that stars can lose a lot of material before they explode. Not only can they lose their outermost layers, but they can be completely stripped all the way down and still produce a brilliant explosion that we can observe from very, very far distances.""

""This event quite literally looks like nothing anyone has ever seen before,"" added Northwestern's Adam Miller, a senior author on the study. ""It was almost so weird that we thought maybe we didn't observe the correct object. This star is telling us that our ideas and theories for how stars evolve are too narrow. It's not that our textbooks are incorrect, but they clearly do not fully capture everything produced in nature. There must be more exotic pathways for a massive star to end its life that we hadn't considered.""

An expert on astronomy's most extreme transient objects, Schulze is a research associate at Northwestern's Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA). Miller is an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and a leading member of CIERA and the NSF-Simons AI Institute for the Sky.

A hot, burning onion

Weighing in at 10 to 100 times heavier than our sun, massive stars are powered by nuclear fusion. In that process, intense pressure and extreme heat in the stellar core cause lighter elements to fuse together, generating heavier elements. When the temperature and density increase in the core, burning begins in the outer layers. As the star evolves over time, successively heavier elements are burned in the core, while lighter elements are burned in a series of shells surrounding the core. This process continues, eventually leading to a core of iron. When the iron core collapses, it triggers a supernova or forms a black hole.

Although massive stars typically shed layers before exploding, SN2021yfj ejected far more material than scientists had ever previously detected. Other observations of ""stripped stars"" have revealed layers of helium or carbon and oxygen -- exposed after the outer hydrogen envelope was lost. But astrophysicists had never glimpsed anything deeper than that -- hinting that something extremely violent and extraordinary must be at play.

Chasing down a cosmic oddity

Schulze and their team discovered SN2021yfj in September 2021, using Northwestern's access to the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Located just east of San Diego, ZTF uses a wide-field camera to scan the entire visible night sky. Since its launch, ZTF has become the world's primary discovery engine for astronomical transients -- fleeting phenomena like supernovae that flare up suddenly and then quickly fade.

After looking through ZTF data, Schulze spotted an extremely luminous object in a star-forming region located 2.2 billion light-years from Earth.

To gain more information about the mysterious object, the team wanted to obtain its spectrum, which breaks down dispersed light into component colors. Each color represents a different element. So, by analyzing a supernova's spectrum, scientists can uncover which elements are present in the explosion.

Although Schulze immediately leapt into action, their spectrum search hit multiple dead ends. Telescopes around the globe were either unavailable or could not see through the clouds to obtain a clear image. Luckily, the team received a surprise from an astronomy colleague, who gathered a spectrum using instruments at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawai'i.

""We thought we had fully lost our opportunity to obtain these observations,"" said Miller. ""So, we went to bed disappointed. But the next morning, a colleague at UC Berkeley unexpectedly provided a spectrum. Without that spectrum we may have never realized that this was a strange and unusual explosion.""

""We saw an interesting explosion, but we had no idea what it was,"" Schulze said of SN2021yfj. ""Almost instantly, we realized it was something we had never seen before, so we needed to study it with all available resources.""

'Something very violent must have happened'

Instead of typical helium, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen -- found in other stripped supernovae -- the spectrum was dominated by strong signals of silicon, sulfur and argon. Nuclear fusion produces these heavier elements within a massive star's deep interior during its final stages of life.

""This star lost most of the material that it produced throughout its lifetime,"" Schulze said. ""So, we could only see the material formed during the months right before its explosion. Something very violent must have happened to cause that.""

While the precise cause of this phenomenon remains an open question, Schulze and Miller propose a rare and powerful process was at play. They are exploring multiple scenarios, including interactions with a potential companion star, a massive pre-supernova eruption or even unusually strong stellar winds.

But, most likely, the team posits this mysterious supernova is the result of a massive star literally tearing itself apart. As the star's core squeezes inward under its own gravity, it becomes even hotter and denser. The extreme heat and density then reignite nuclear fusion with such incredible intensity that it causes a powerful burst of energy that pushes away the star's outer layers. Each time the star undergoes a new pair-instability episode, the corresponding pulse sheds more material.

""One of the most recent shell ejections collided with a pre-existing shell, which produced the brilliant emission that we saw as SN2021yfj,"" Schulze said.

""While we have a theory for how nature created this particular explosion,"" Miller said, ""I wouldn't bet my life that it's correct, because we still only have one discovered example. This star really underscores the need to uncover more of these rare supernovae to better understand their nature and how they form.""

The study, ""Extremely stripped supernova reveals a silicon and sulphur formation site,"" was supported by the National Science Foundation. Support from CIERA provided access to ZTF telescope data.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This is where tree planting has the biggest climate impact","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250820000810.htm","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 04:37:01 GMT","

More trees will cool the climate and suppress fires, but mainly if planted in the tropics, according to a new UC Riverside study.

The study, published in npj Climate and Atmospheric Science, found that tree planting is generally a net positive for the climate because it helps pull warming carbon out of the atmosphere. However, local effects on temperature not related to carbon varied significantly by region. At higher latitudes, trees could have a slight heating effect, while the opposite is true in the tropics.

""Our study found more cooling from planting in warm, wet regions, where trees grow year-round. Tropical trees not only pull carbon dioxide from the air, they also cool while releasing water vapor,"" said study first author and UCR graduate student James Gomez. ""It's not that planting elsewhere doesn't help - it does - but the tropics offer the strongest returns per tree.""

These findings mirror the results of an earlier UCR study that shows planting trees could cool the surface of the planet even more than previously expected. While that study factored in the chemical effects of trees interacting with the atmosphere, this study places more emphasis on understanding the physical effects of tree planting.

These effects include ""tree sweating,"" or evapotranspiration. Tree roots pull water from the soil, which then travels up through the trunk and into the leaves. When pores in the leaves open up so the tree can take in carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, some of the water in the leaves evaporates into the air. This process cools the air on Earth's surface and cools the tree, too.

""It's just like the way sweating cools your body,"" Gomez said. ""In the tropics, there is constantly water available for trees, and that increases transpiration.""

Trees can also reduce the amount of sunlight that reaches the planet's surface. As they give off water vapor, the air can become more humid. More humidity can mean more clouds, and water vapor itself can soak up some sun. Both of these effects reduce the amount of sun that reaches the ground, giving a cooling effect.

The physical effects of the added trees yield weak global mean cooling of 0.01° F, although this cooling does become significant in the tropics at about 0.1° F, with some tropical regions like central Africa experiencing cooling up to 0.8° F.

Accounting for the carbon sequestration of the added trees, which here are approximated offline, is expected to amplify these cooling effects by about 0.15° F globally. The researchers note that better estimates of the carbon sequestration effects will be explored in a future study, where both the physical and carbon cycle effects of establishing new forests are interactively simulated.

""Though the non-CO2 effects are small, it is good news that they are not warming, which prior studies have indicated is likely,"" Gomez said.

For this study, the researchers also used a relatively realistic scenario, planting trees in places where they have been removed, avoiding deforestation, and limiting new trees to places where they would not displace peopleor too much agricultural land. In addition, the experiment used data from 12 climate models commonly used for international policy analysis, so the results would be more reliable than relying on a single model.

The researchers also found that, in some cases, trees can have a fire suppression effect. ""In tropical savannahs, and in other places around the world, trees are much more fire resistant than grasses,"" Gomez said.

However, the study found that in parts of Canada and the northeastern U.S. trees would likely cause more fires and reduce cooling by absorbing too much sun.

""This is not an invitation to get rid of the trees growing there! They provide multiple benefits for ecosystems and diversity, reducing CO2 and cooling the surrounding areas,"" Gomez said.

""What we need is a Goldilocks zone of trees in each region. Just the right amount to have the strongest and most positive climate effects.""

Southwest Research Institute led a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) survey, discovering a previously unknown tiny moon orbiting Uranus. A team led by SwRI's Dr. Maryame El Moutamid discovered the small object in a series of images taken on Feb. 2, 2025, bringing Uranus' total moon count to 29.

""As part of JWST's guest observer program, we found a previously unknown satellite of the ice giant, which has been provisionally designated S/2025 U 1,"" said El Moutamid, a lead scientist in SwRI's Solar System Science and Exploration Division in Boulder, Colorado. ""This object, by far the smallest object discovered to date, was detected in a series of 10 long exposures obtained by the Near-Infrared Camera.""

Located in the outer solar system, Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Known as ""the sideways planet"" for its extreme axial tilt, the cyan-colored ice giant has a deep atmosphere composed of hydrogen, helium and methane. Scientists think Uranus' larger moons are roughly equal parts water ice and silicate rock.

""Assuming that the new moon has an albedo comparable to other nearby satellites, this object is probably around six miles (10 km) in diameter,"" El Moutamid said. ""It is well below the detection threshold for the Voyager 2 cameras.""

Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to visit Uranus so far, coming within 50,000 miles of its cloud tops on Jan. 24, 1986. The spacecraft collected thousands of images, discovering rings and small satellites, including 10 of its named moons.

Uranus' 28 moons include five major moons -- Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel and Miranda -- discovered between 1787 and 1948. Known as ""the literary moons,"" Uranus satellites are named for characters in Shakespeare and the works of Alexander Pope.

The new moon is at the edge of Uranus' inner rings. It is located about 35,000 miles (56,250 km) from its center in the planet's equatorial plane, between the orbits of Ophelia and Bianca. Ophelia is about 13 miles (43 km) in diameter, while Bianca is an elongated object around 40 by 29 miles (64 by 46 km) in dimension.

""With so many of Uranus' moons named for Shakespearean characters, our team is getting a lot of culture trying to figure out what to name our new discovery,"" El Moutamid said.

Astronomers from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, have discovered a vast and expanding bubble of gas and dust surrounding a red supergiant star - the largest structure of its kind ever seen in the Milky Way. The bubble, which contains as much mass as the Sun, was blown out in a mysterious stellar eruption around 4000 years ago. Why the star survived such a powerful event is a puzzle, the scientists say.

The new results are published in the scientific journal Astronomy and Astrophysics, and the team was led by Mark Siebert, Chalmers, Sweden. Using the ALMA radio telescope in Chile, the researchers observed the star DFK 52 - a red supergiant similar to the well-known star Betelgeuse.

""We got a big surprise when we saw what ALMA was showing us. The star is more or less a twin of Betelgeuse, but it's surrounded by a vast, messy bubble of material,"" says Mark Siebert at Chalmers.

The bubble, a complex of clouds of gas and dust, weighs as much as the Sun, and extends out 1.4 light years from the star. That's thousands of times wider than our own solar system.

If the star was as close to us as Betelgeuse is, the bubble would appear to span a third of the full Moon's width in the sky.

ALMA's radio observations let astronomers measure the motion of molecules in the cloud, revealing that the bubble is expanding. They believe it was formed when the star suddenly ejected part of its outer layers in a powerful explosion just a few thousand years ago.

""The bubble is made of material that used to be part of the star. It must have been ejected in a dramatic event, an explosion, that happened about four thousand years ago. In cosmic terms, that's just a moment ago,"" says Elvire De Beck, astronomer at Chalmers.

The galaxy's next supernova?

Why DFK 52 shed so much mass without exploding as a supernova is still unclear. One possibility is that the star has a hidden companion that helped it cast off its outer layers.

""To us, it's a mystery as to how the star managed to expel so much material in such a short timeframe. Maybe, like Betelgeuse seems to, it has a companion star that's still to be discovered,"" says Mark Siebert.

Red supergiants like DFK 52 are nearing the ends of their lives and are expected to eventually explode as supernovae. Could this star be next?

""We're planning more observations to understand what's happening - and to find out whether this might be the Milky Way's next supernova. If this is a typical red supergiant, it could explode sometime in the next million years,"" says Elvire De Beck.

More about the research:

The research is presented in the paper ""Stephenson 2 DFK 52: Discovery of an exotic red supergiant in the massive stellar cluster RSGC2,"" published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. The image has been featured as ESO's Picture of the Week.

The researchers involved in the study are Mark Siebert, Elvire De Beck and Wouter Vlemmings from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, and Guillermo Quintana Lacaci from Instituto de Fisica Fundamental, Spain.

Red supergiants are some of the rarest, brightest stars in the sky. They are the final stage of evolution of stars born much more massive than the Sun (more than eight times the Sun's mass). For astronomers, they are keys to understanding the life stories of all stars and planets. The most massive stars create and spread newly-formed elements throughout interstellar space, energising gas and dust, and helping new generations of stars to form.

The closest red supergiants in our galaxy, the Milky Way, are easily visible for anyone with a clear view of a dark night sky. Betelgeuse, in the constellation Orion, and Antares, in Scorpius, are both well-known examples of red supergiant stars.

More about the ALMA telescope:

The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), an international astronomy facility in Chile, is a partnership of ESO, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) of Japan in cooperation with the Republic of Chile.

In Sweden, Onsala Space Observatory at Chalmers University of Technology, has been involved in ALMA since its inception; receivers for the telescope are one of many contributions. Onsala Space Observatory is host to the Nordic ALMA Regional Centre, which provides technical expertise to the ALMA project and supports astronomers in the Nordic countries in using ALMA.

Researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have found that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in children. The study, published on August 14 in BMC Environmental Health, is the first to apply the rigorous Navigation Guide methodology to systematically evaluate the rigor and quality of the scientific literature.

Acetaminophen (often sold under the brand name Tylenol®, and known as paracetamol outside the United States and Canada) is the most commonly used over-the-counter pain and fever medication during pregnancy and is used by more than half of pregnant women worldwide. Until now, acetaminophen has been considered the safest option for managing headache, fever, and other pain. Analysis by the Mount Sinai-led team of 46 studies incorporating data from more than 100,000 participants across multiple countries challenges this perception and underscores the need for both caution and further study.

The Navigation Guide Systematic Review methodology is a gold-standard framework for synthesizing and evaluating environmental health data. This approach allows researchers to assess and rate each study's risk of bias, such as selective reporting of the outcomes or incomplete data, as well as the strength of the evidence and the quality of the studies individually and collectively.

""Our findings show that higher-quality studies are more likely to show a link between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and increased risks of autism and ADHD,"" said Diddier Prada, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Population Health Science and Policy, and Environmental Medicine and Climate Science, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. ""Given the widespread use of this medication, even a small increase in risk could have major public health implications.""

The paper also explores biological mechanisms that could explain the association between acetaminophen use and these disorders. Acetaminophen is known to cross the placental barrier and may trigger oxidative stress, disrupt hormones, and cause epigenetic changes that interfere with fetal brain development.

While the study does not show that acetaminophen directly causes neurodevelopmental disorders, the research team's findings strengthen the evidence for a connection and raise concerns about current clinical practices.

The researchers call for cautious, time-limited use of acetaminophen during pregnancy under medical supervision; updated clinical guidelines to better balance the benefits and risks; and further research to confirm these findings and identify safer alternatives for managing pain and fever in expectant mothers.

""Pregnant women should not stop taking medication without consulting their doctors,"" Dr. Prada emphasized. ""Untreated pain or fever can also harm the baby. Our study highlights the importance of discussing the safest approach with health care providers and considering non-drug options whenever possible.""

With diagnoses of autism and ADHD increasing worldwide, these findings have significant implications for public health policy, clinical guidelines, and patient education. The study also highlights the urgent need for pharmaceutical innovation to provide safer alternatives for pregnant women.

The study was conducted in collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles; University of Massachusetts Lowell; and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

Funding for this study was provided by the National Cancer Institute (U54CA267776), the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (R35ES031688), and the National Institute on Aging (U01AG088684).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","How hidden cosmic highways feed the Universe's biggest stars","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250821004232.htm","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 05:46:01 GMT","

The size of our universe and the bodies within it is incomprehensible for us lowly humans. The sun has a mass that is more than 330,000 that of our Earth, and yet there are stars in the universe that completely dwarf our sun.

Stars with masses more than eight times that of the sun are considered high mass stars. These form rapidly in a process that gives off stellar wind and radiation, which could not result in stars of such high mass without somehow overcoming this loss of mass, or feedback. Something is feeding these stars, but how exactly they can accumulate so much mass so quickly has remained a mystery.

Observations of enormous disk-like structures that form around a star -- accretion disks -- had been proposed as the chief way of rapidly feeding young stars. However, a team of researchers from several institutions including Kyoto University and the University of Tokyo, has discovered another possibility.

""Our work seems to show that these structures are being fed by streamers, which are flows of gas that bring matter from scales larger than a thousand astronomical units, essentially acting as massive gas highways,"" says corresponding author Fernando Olguin.

Following on previous research, the team required a higher angular resolution to observe this system in detail, since regions forming high-mass stars are more distant than those with lower mass. The researchers utilized the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, or ALMA, a powerful telescope in Chile composed of an array of antennae that can observe dust and molecular line emissions at millimeter wavelengths.

Their observations revealed a young star feeding from potentially two streamers. One such streamer was connected to the central region of the star, with a velocity gradient indicative of rotation and possibly infall. This suggests that the streamer carries enough matter at a high rate to quench feedback effects from the young star, eventually contributing to the overly dense region observed around the central massive star.

The research team expected to see a dust disk or torus of several hundreds astronomical units in size, but they did not expect the spiral arms to reach far closer to the central source.

""We found streamers feeding what at that time was thought to be a disk, but to our surprise, there is either no disk or it is extremely small,"" says Olguin.

These results suggest that, independent of the presence of a disk around the central star, streamers can transport large amounts of gas to feed star-forming regions, even in the presence of feedback from the central star.

Next, the team plans to expand their research by studying other regions to see if this is a common mode of accretion that results in the formation of massive stars. They also plan to explore the gas close to the star to determine whether they can confirm, or rule out, the presence of small disks.

The odds of high-severity wildfire were nearly one-and-a-half times higher on industrial private land than on publicly owned forests, a new study found. Forests managed by timber companies were more likely to exhibit the conditions that megafires love -- dense stands of regularly spaced trees with continuous vegetation connecting the understory to the canopy.

The research, led by the University of Utah, University of California, Berkeley, and the United States Forest Service, is the first to identify how extreme weather conditions and forest management practices jointly impact fire severity.Leveraging a unique lidar dataset, the authors created three-dimensional maps of public and private forests before five wildfires burned 1.1 million acres in the northern Sierra Nevada, California.

In periods of extreme weather, stem density -- the number of trees per acre -- became the most important predictor of a high-severity fire. Even in the face of accelerating climate change, how we manage the land will make a difference.

""That's a really hopeful finding because it means that we can adjust how we manage these landscapes to impact the way fires move through them,"" said Jacob Levine, postdoctoral researcher at the U and lead author of the study. ""Strategies that reduce density by thinning out both small and mature trees will make forests more robust and resilient to fire in the future.""

In a 2022 study, Levine and collaborators found that fire severity was typically higher on privately managed forests. They also discovered the risks extended to areas near to, but not owned by, private industry, threatening the wilderness, small landowners and urban areas in their shadow.This new study is the first to identify the underlying forest structures that make high-severity fires more likely in some areas than in others.

The study was published on Aug. 20, 2025, in the journal Global Change Biology.

Lidar unlocks forest structure secrets

Plumas National Forest, the study area in California's northern Sierra Nevada, is emblematic of the wider trend of wildfire occurrence and severity. The region's mixed conifer forests are adapted to periodic, low- to medium-severity fires that cleared vegetation, creating large spaces between clumps of trees. Efforts to increase timber resources led the U.S. government to implement fire suppression policies in the 1800s, including a ban on controlled burns that Indigenous People practiced for millennia. In the absence of natural fire cycles and Indigenous burning, modern forests have more fodder to fuel high-severity fires, defined as a fire that kills more than 95% of overstory trees.

Plumas National Forest is a mosaic of private industrial and public ownership, and 70% of the study area was burned in five massive wildfires between 2019 and 2021, including the largest single fire in California's recorded history, the Dixie Fire. Serendipitously, a unique dataset had been collected a year before the region burned.

In 2018, the U.S. Forest Service, Geological Survey and National Aeronautics and Space Administration surveyed the Plumas National Forest and surrounding private land using airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) flights. The lidar sensors shoot billions of lasers at the landscape below, which bounce off the grass, shrubs, saplings, tree canopies and other structures in the forest with high precision.

""We have a really detailed picture of what the forest looked like immediately before these massive fires. It's an unbelievably valuable thing to have,"" Levine said. ""Understanding the forest structures that lead to high-severity fire allows us to target mitigation strategies to get ahead of this massive fire problem while still producing enough timber to meet market demand.""

Private vs public management strategies

Timber companies are focused on maximizing profits and providing a sustainable source of wood, a valuable resource for society and economic engine for rural communities. Most practice plantation forestry -- clear-cutting an area and replanting the trees in a tightly packed grid. After 80 to 100 years, they do it all again, leaving a patchwork of dense stands of trees of similar age and size.

""You can think about stacking a bunch of matches together in a grid -- that's going to burn a lot better than if you have those matches dispersed as smaller clumps,"" Levine explained. ""A bigger fire can easily reach the canopy in dense forests. Then it's ripping through one tree after another, tossing out chunks of burning material miles in advance. It's a different story.""

The objectives of public lands are more varied, requiring management for grazing, recreation, restoration, timber production and wildlife corridors. They're also beholden to the public, which stymies their ability to do active management. Environmental organizations often sue to stop proposed projects that would remove trees to thin down density.

Although the study demonstrates that private industrial lands fare worse, both private and public agencies have much room for improvement to protect our nation's forests. Most Sierra Nevada trees lack adaptations to recover from high-severity fires, leading to more and more of our forests turning into shrub and grasslands.

""This has major implications for timber, but also for carbon sequestration, water quality, wildlife habitat and recreation,"" Levine said. ""Shrub and grasslands can be beautiful, but when we think of the Sierra Nevada we picture majestic forests. Without major changes in forest management, future generations could inherit a landscape that looks very different than the one we cherish today.""

Other authors include Brandon Collins of the U.S. Forest Service and University of California, Berkeley; Michelle Coppoletta of the U.S. Forest Service; and Scott Stephens of University of California, Berkeley.

The study, ""Extreme weather magnifies the effects of forest structure on wildfire, driving increased severity in industrial forests,"" was published on Aug. 20, 2025, in the journal Global Change Biology.

The brain's map of the body in the primary somatosensory cortex remains unchanged after amputation.Credit: Zephyr/Science Photo Library

A brain-imaging study of people with amputated arms has upended a long-standing belief: that the brain's map of the body reorganizes itself to compensate for missing body parts.

Previous research1 had suggested that neurons in the brain region holding this internal map, called the primary somatosensory cortex, would grow into the neighbouring area of the cortex that previously sensed the limb. 

But the latest findings, published in Nature Neuroscience on 21 August2, reveal that the primary somatosensory cortex stays remarkably constant even years after arm amputation. The study refutes foundational knowledge in the field of neuroscience that losing a limb results in a drastic reorganization of this region, the authors say.

“Pretty much every neuroscientist has learnt through their textbook that the brain has the capacity for reorganization, and this is demonstrated through studies on amputees,” says study senior author Tamar Makin, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge, UK. But “textbooks can be wrong”, she adds. “We shouldn't take anything for granted, especially when it comes to brain research.”

The discovery could lead to the development of better prosthetic devices, or improved treatments for pain in ‘phantom limbs' — when people continue to sense the amputated limb. It could also help scientists working to restore sensation in people who have had amputations.

Study first author Hunter Schone, a neuroscientist at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, says that previous reports from some people with amputations had led him and his colleagues to doubt the idea that the brain's map of the body is reorganized after amputation. These maps are responsible for processing sensory information, such as touch or temperature, at specific body regions. “They would say: ‘I can still feel the limb, I can still move individual fingers of a hand I haven't had for decades,'” Schone says.

To investigate this contradiction, the researchers followed three people who were due to undergo amputation of one of their arms. The team used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the cortical representations of the body before the surgery, and then after the amputation for up to five years. It is the first study to do this.

Before their amputations, participants performed various movements, such as tapping their fingers, pursing their lips and flexing their toes while inside an fMRI scanner that measured the activity in different parts of the brain. This allowed the researchers to create a cortical ‘map' showing which regions sensed the hand. To test the idea that neighbouring neurons redistribute in the cortex after amputation, they also made maps of the adjacent cortical area — in this case, the part that processes sensations from the lips. The participants repeated this exercise several times after their amputation, tapping “with their phantom fingers”, says Schone.

The analysis revealed that the brain's representation of the body was consistent after the arm was amputated. Even five years after surgery, the cortical map of the missing hand was still activated in the same way as before amputation. There was also no evidence that the cortical representation of the lips had shifted into the hand region following amputation — which is what previous studies suggested would happen.

Makin says their study is “the most decisive direct evidence” that the brain's in-built body map remains stable after the loss of a limb. “It just goes against the foundational knowledge of the field,” she says.

The adult brain's capacity for cortical reorganization remains debated. Using longitudinal neuroimaging in three adults, followed before and up to 5 years after arm amputation, we compared cortical activity elicited by movement of the hand (before amputation) versus phantom hand (after amputation) and lips (before and after amputation). We observed stable cortical representations of both hand and lips in primary sensorimotor regions. By directly quantifying activity changes across amputation, we demonstrate that amputation does not trigger large-scale cortical reorganization.

What happens to the brain's map of the body when a part of the body is removed? Over the last five decades, this question has captivated neuroscientists and clinicians, driving research into the brain's capacity to reorganize itself. Primary somatosensory cortex (S1), known for its highly detailed body map, has historically been the definitive region for studying cortical reorganization1,2. For example, foundational research in monkeys reported that, after an amputation or deafferentation, the affected region within the S1 body map suddenly responds to inputs from cortically neighboring body parts (for example, the face)3,4. Additional neuroimaging studies in human amputees supported the theory that amputation of an arm triggers large-scale cortical reorganization of the S1 body map5,6,7, with a dramatic redistribution of cortical resources, hijacking the deprived territory1.

Recent studies have challenged this view by harnessing human amputees' reports of experiencing vivid sensations of the missing (phantom) limb. First, human neuroimaging studies demonstrated that voluntary movements of phantom fingers engage neural patterns resembling those of able-bodied individuals8,9,10. Second, phantom sensations are evoked by cortical11 or peripheral12,13 nerve stimulation, suggesting an intact neural representation of the amputated limb, despite its physical absence. Third, neuroimaging studies using both tactile stimulation and movement paradigms reported no changes in face or lip activity within the deprived cortex of adult amputee participants compared to able-bodied controls14,15 (although remapping has been observed in children)16.

This debate—whether or not amputation triggers large-scale reorganization—remains unresolved17,18, with some suggesting that the two views are not conceptually exclusive, that is, preservation and reorganization can coexist5,19,20. However, a fundamental issue with the evidence on both sides of this debate is a methodological reliance on cross-sectional designs (that is, comparisons between participants). While offering valuable proofs of concept, these studies cannot determine whether the maps of the phantom hand or face are truly preserved or changed relative to their pre-amputation state. To directly track the evolution of cortical representations before and after amputation, we implemented a longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach to track the cortical representations of the hand and face (lips) in three adult participants up to 5 years after arm amputation (Supplementary Video 1), compared with able-bodied control participants (Ctrl) (Fig. 1a). Avoiding the confounding effects of cross-sectional designs21, we directly quantified the impact of arm amputation on S1 (re)organization.

a, Experimental timeline. Scans before and after amputation were conducted across 4–5 time points: twice before, and at 3 months, 6 months and 1.5 (P1)/5 years (P2) after amputation. b, Illustration depicting the three participants 6 months after amputation, including their subjective description of their phantom limb position. c, Phantom movements are not imaginary. Univariate activity (z-scored) contrast map displaying a participant's attempts to open and close the phantom hand versus imagining movement, 6 months after amputation. d, Participant's hand (red) and lip (blue) cortical activation maps (contrasted against feet movements) in the affected hand hemisphere across 4–5 sessions. All maps were minimally thresholded at 33% the maximum z-statistic and used a common color scale (the participant's maximum z-statistic > 4.5). Participants agreed to have their image reproduced. Brain illustrations in a were created in BioRender.

We studied three adult participants (case studies P1, P2 and P3) undergoing arm amputation (demographics in Extended Data Table 1) across 4–5 time points, and 16 able-bodied Ctrls at four time points over 6 months (Fig. 1a). Before amputation, all participants could move all fingers to varying ranges (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Video 2). After amputation, all participants reported vivid phantom limb sensations (Fig. 1b), including volitional phantom finger movement (Extended Data Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1). Motor control over the phantom hand was further confirmed by residual limb muscle contractions during phantom movements (Supplementary Video 2), and selective activation in primary sensorimotor cortex for attempted, but not imagined, phantom movements (Fig. 1c). The critical question is to what degree S1 phantom activity reflects the pre-existing hand.

During scanning, participants performed visually cued movements involving tapping individual fingers, pursing lips and flexing toes. Case study participants demonstrated strikingly consistent hand and lip cortical maps before and after amputation (Fig. 1d). Projecting hand and individual finger activity profiles across S1 revealed stable activity before and after amputation, with phantom activity resembling the amplitude and spatial activity spread before amputation (Fig. 2a). A center of gravity (COG) analysis of these profiles revealed spatially consistent hand and individual finger activity in our case studies, with similar pre- and post-amputation session differences over 6 months as Ctrls (six Crawford t-tests per participant; P1: 0.14 ≤ Puncorr ≤ 0.58; P2: 0.06 ≤ Puncorr ≤ 0.81; P3: 0.10 ≤ Puncorr ≤ 0.91). Notably, this stability could not be attributed to a pre-existing baseline difference as hand activity before amputation was normal relative to Ctrls (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Similar pre- and post-amputation stability was observed in the motor cortex (M1) (Extended Data Fig. 3a) and for the intact (unaffected) hand (Extended Data Fig. 4a).

a, Longitudinal hand and individual finger activity (versus rest) projected across the S1 (BA3b) region of interest (ROI) segmented into 49 segments of similar height. The affected hand's activity over five sessions (indicated in the legend) for each of the case study participants who underwent an amputation is shown; the bottom row shows the finger COG shifts before and after amputation. The black lines reflect the activity before amputation, the yellow, orange and red lines after amputation. The COG shifts of the case study participants (red) for the hand and individual fingers fell within the distribution of Ctrls (gray; six comparisons per participant; two-tailed Crawford t-test: P1 (6 months): 0.14 ≤ Puncorr ≤ 0.58; P2 (6 months): 0.06 ≤ Puncorr ≤ 0.81; P3 (6 months): 0.10 ≤ Puncorr ≤ 0.91). Positive values indicate medial shifts (toward the feet); negative values indicate lateral shifts (toward the lips) in S1. Ctrl 95% percentile interval data are shown as gray violin plots. P1 data are shown as a red triangle. P2 data are shown as a red square. P3 data are shown as a red star. For simplicity, the Ctrl values are all for the left (nondominant) hand. b, Before and after amputation single-finger multivoxel correlations: for each finger of the case study participants, voxelwise activity correlations before and at the final scan after amputation are shown. All other correlations are comprehensively reported in Extended Data Fig. 5. The before to after amputation correlations for all participants were statistically significant (five two-tailed Pearson correlations per participant; P1 (6 months): 0.68 ≤ r ≤ 0.90, Puncorr < 0.001; P2 (6 months): 0.80 ≤ r ≤ 0.85, Puncorr < 0.001; P3 (6 months): 0.88 ≤ r ≤ 0.91, Puncorr < 0.001). c, Finger selectivity maps before and after amputation. Each contrast map reflects the selective activity for each finger (versus all others), masked to the hand ROI. Each mask was minimally thresholded at 33% the maximum z-statistic and binarized. Color codes are indicated on the right. To visualize the multi-finger activity at a single voxel, a 70% opacity filter was applied to all finger maps. d, Left, Graphic illustration of multivoxel analyses using a linear SVM decoder. Right, Longitudinal classifier performance. The line colors denote training-testing cross-validation session pairs, respectively, as indicated in the legend. The gray-shaded area reflects the data of able-bodied Ctrls before and after (6 months) (95% percentile interval). Training the classifier on the pre-amputation data and testing it on the post-amputation data (and vice versa) revealed significantly above chance classification accuracies for all case study participants at all post-amputation sessions (two-tailed, one-sample t-test: P1: before 1.5 years: 89%; P < 0.001; P2: before 5 years: 67%; P < 0.001; P3: before 6 months: 88%; P < 0.001). All other annotations are depicted in Fig. 1.

Next, we investigated the stability of S1 finger representation in greater detail using a multivoxel pattern analysis (Fig. 2b and Methods). Multivoxel activity patterns for the pre-amputated versus phantom fingers were significantly correlated at 6 months (five Pearson correlations per participant; P1: 0.68 ≤ r ≤ 0.90, Puncorr < 0.001; P2: 0.80 ≤ r ≤ 0.85, Puncorr < 0.001; P3: 0.88 ≤ r ≤ 0.91, Puncorr < 0.001). Correlation coefficients at 6 months fell within the typical distribution seen in Ctrls (see Extended Data Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 1 for the Ctrl values). Similar stability was observed in M1 (Extended Data Fig. 3b) and for the intact hand (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Combined, this confirmed that activity was largely stable before and after amputation at the single-voxel level.

We next considered finger selectivity, that is, the activity profiles for each finger versus the other fingers. Qualitative finger-mapping revealed preserved somatotopy before and after amputation (Fig. 2c). We applied a multivoxel pattern analysis using a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier (Fig. 2d) to explore whether a pre-amputation-trained classifier could decode phantom finger movements (and vice versa). This analysis revealed significantly above chance classification for all case study participants across all post-amputation sessions (Fig. 2d; 2–3 one-sample t-tests per participant: P1 (before/1.5 years): 90%; t(9) = 10.5, Puncorr < 0.001; P2 (before/5 years): 67%; t(9) = 4.85, Puncorr < 0.001; P3 (before/6 months): 89%; t(9) = 11.0, Puncorr < 0.001), with similar evidence in M1 (Extended Data Fig. 3c).

We next investigated whether amputation reduces finger-selective information, as suggested by previous cross-sectional studies22. Assessing for abnormalities in the pre-amputation data, we noted that one of the case study participants, P2, exhibited lower classification for the pre-amputation hand relative to Ctrls (Extended Data Fig. 1), probably because of P2's impaired motor control before amputation (Supplementary Video 2). Our key question remains whether this information degrades further after amputation. When comparing selectivity differences over 6 months relative to Ctrls, none of the case study participants showed significant reductions in average finger selectivity (Crawford t-test: P1: t(15) = −0.34, P = 0.73; P2: t(15) = −0.24, P = 0.80; P3: t(15) = −1.0, P = 0.33; Extended Data Fig. 6c). While finger selectivity was reduced at P2's and P3's final scan relative to their baseline (Fig. 2d; three Wilcoxon rank-sum tests per participant: P1 (1.5 years): W = 3.0, Puncorr = 0.11; P2 (5 years): W = 2.0, Puncorr = 0.005; P3 (6 months): W = 1.0, Puncorr = 0.01), these reductions could be attributed to the much greater longitudinal variability between training and testing classifier samples23. To further explore this, we directly compared the finger selectivity of the affected hand versus the unaffected hand. For two of three of our participants, at the 6-month time point, we observed decreased finger-selective information in the affected hand relative to the unaffected hand, compared with Ctrls (dominant hand versus non-dominant hand; two Crawford t-tests per participant; before 6 months: P1: Puncorr = 0.03; P2: Puncorr = 0.03; P3: Puncorr = 0.10; Supplementary Fig. 1). Collectively across analyses, the decoding results suggested slight (uncorrected) reductions in finger selectivity or increased finger selectivity for the intact hand.

We also performed a complementary representational similarity analysis (RSA) using Mahalanobis distances (a continuous measure of finger selectivity), cross-validated across sessions. Like the decoding, RSA confirmed that finger-selective information was significantly consistent across amputation for all case study participants at all post-amputation time points (2–3 one-sample t-tests per participant: Puncorr < 0.0001; Extended Data Fig. 6a,b), with similar evidence in M1 (Supplementary Fig. 3c). We noted a few temporary, idiosyncratic (uncorrected) instances of reduced finger selectivity relative to Ctrls (Extended Data Fig. 6c). Using the RSA distances, we also tested the typicality of the inter-finger representational structure, an additional feature of hand representation. Correlating each participant's inter-finger pattern to a canonical pattern revealed no deterioration in typicality scores 6 months after amputation compared to Ctrls, with P3 even showing higher typicality than the Ctrl group (Crawford t-test: P1: t(15) = −0.9, P = 0.38; P2: t(15) = −0.9, P = 0.38; P3: t(15) = −3.5, P = 0.003; Extended Data Fig. 6d). Therefore, despite idiosyncratic reductions in finger selectivity, the representational structure was preserved after amputation.

Finally, we examined changes in lip representation, previously implicated with reorganization after arm amputation4,7. Projecting hand and lip univariate activity onto the S1 segments revealed no evidence of lip activity shifting into the hand region after amputation (Fig. 3a). All case study participants showed typical longitudinal variability at their 6-month scan, relative to Ctrls, for lip COG (Fig. 3b; Crawford t-test: P1: t(15) = 0.25, P = 0.80; P2: t(15) = −0.89, P = 0.38; P3: t(15) = −0.9, P = 0.37). Furthermore, lip activity in the S1 hand region at the final scan was typical (Fig. 3c; P1 (1.5 years): t(15) = 0.8, P = 0.20; P2 (5 years): t(15) = −0.5, P = 0.71; P3 (6 months): t(15) = 1.2, P = 0.10). Also, when visualizing the lip map boundaries within S1 for all sessions, using a common minimum threshold, there was no evidence for an extension of the lip map (Fig. 3d). Examining the multivariate lip representational content, P2 showed an increased lip-to-thumb multivariate distance at their 6-month scan, relative to Ctrls (Fig. 3e; Crawford t-test: P1: t(15) = 0.69, P = 0.25; P2: t(15) = 3.1, P = 0.003; P3: t(15) = 0.74, P = 0.23; intact hand and feet data are included in Extended Data Fig. 7) However, it returned to the typical range of Ctrls when assessed at their 5-year time point. Similar stability was found in M1 (Extended Data Fig. 3) and the unaffected hemisphere (Extended Data Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that amputation does not affect lip topography or representational content in S1.

a, The lip activity (versus rest) of each case study participant for their sessions projected across the S1 ROI. The black lines reflect pre-amputation activity, with the yellow (3 months), orange (6 months) and red (1.5/5 years) lines reflecting activity after amputation. The gray region depicts the approximated coverage of the hand portion in the S1. b, All case study participants showed typical longitudinal variability at their 6-month scan, relative to Ctrls, for the lip COG. Positive values reflect medial shifts (toward the hand). c, All case study participants showed typical lip activity in the S1 hand region at the final scan. The right corner depicts representative Ctrl participant activity for the lips (versus the feet) minimally thresholded at 33% the maximum z-statistic. d, All case study participants exhibited no expansion of the lip map boundaries toward the hand region. Maps were masked to the S1 ROI and were minimally thresholded (z > 4.5). e, All case study participants showed stable thumb-to-lip multivariate Mahalanobis distances cross-validated at their final scan, relative to Ctrls. f, Comparing the case study participants to a chronic amputee dataset (n = 26). Left, Chronic amputee's group-level cortical activation maps of the phantom hand and lips (versus rest) projected onto a single hemisphere (minimally thresholded at z > 3.1). Opacity was applied to activity outside the S1 ROI. Group univariate activity was plotted as a line (group mean ± s.e.) for the phantom hand (red) and lips (blue) across the S1 ROI. Middle, All case study participants, relative to chronic amputees, showed a typical COG for both the phantom hand (top) and lips (bottom). Right, All case study participants exhibited typical lip activity in the S1 hand region during their final session, which is consistent with chronic amputees. The magnitude of lip activity (95% percentile interval) in the S1 hand region for a secondary able-bodied Ctrl group (n = 18) is shown in gray. Chronic amputees are shown in light red and the last session data for the case study participants are shown in dark red. All other annotations are the same as described in Fig. 2.

To complement our longitudinal findings, we compared our case studies to a cohort of 26 chronic upper-limb amputee participants, on average 23.5 years after amputation (Fig. 3f; individual hand and lip cortical maps shown in Extended Data Fig. 8). The topographical features of our case studies were comparable to chronic amputees for both the phantom hand [Crawford t-test: P1 (1.5 years): t(15) = 0.28, P = 0.77; P2 (5 years): t(15) = 0.29, P = 0.77; P = 0.77; P3 (6 months): t(15) = 0.28, P = 0.22; P = 0.82] and lips [P1 (1.5 years: t(15) = 0.53, P = 0.59; P2 (5 years): t(15) = 0.01, P = 0.98; P3 (6 months): t(15) = 0.37, P = 0.71]. Average lip activity within the S1 hand region was slightly (although not significantly) higher for a few of our case studies relative to chronic amputees [Crawford t-test: P1 (1.5 years): t(15) = 1.6, P = 0.10; P2 (5 years): t(15) = 0.24, P = 0.81; P3 (6 months): t(15) = 1.8, P = 0.065], reflecting that lip activity does not steadily increase in the years after amputation. Collectively, these results provide long-term evidence for the stability of hand and lip representations despite amputation.

Beyond the stability of lip representation across amputation, our findings reveal highly consistent hand activity despite amputation. This unchanged hand representation challenges the foundational assumption that S1 activity is primarily tied to its peripheral inputs, suggesting S1 is not a passive relay of its peripheral input, but an active supporter of a resilient ‘model' of the body, even after amputation. Therefore, we conclude that, in the adult brain, S1 representation can be maintained by top-down (for example, efferent) inputs. This interpretation sheds new light on previous studies showing similar S1 topographical patterns activated by touch24, and executed25 and planned movement26.

Because of the limitations of nonhuman models that cannot communicate phantom sensations, it is not surprising that the persistent representation of a body part, despite amputation, has been neglected in previous studies. Without access to this subjective dimension, researchers may have missed the profound resilience of cortical representations. Instead, previous studies determined S1 topography by applying a ‘winner-takes-all' strategy, probing responses to remaining (intact) body parts and noting the most responsive body parts in the input-deprived cortex. Ignoring phantom representations in these analyses leads to severe biases in the interpretation of the area's inputs (as demonstrated in Extended Data Fig. 9). Combined with cross-sectional designs, this has incorrectly led to the impression of large-scale reorganization of the lip representation after amputation. Our longitudinal approach reveals no signs of topographic reorganization in S1, not even subtle upregulation from homeostasis, further reinforcing the notion that S1 is not governed by deprivation-driven plasticity.

For brain–computer interfaces, our findings demonstrate a highly detailed and stable representation of the amputated limb for long-term applications27. For phantom limb pain treatments, our study indicates that targeted muscle reinnervation and regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces do not ‘reverse' reorganization or alter the cortical hand representation22,28. Finally, our findings affirm the unaltered nature of adult sensory body maps after amputation, suggesting that Hebbian and homeostatic deprivation-driven plasticity is even more marginal than considered by even the field's strongest opponents of large-scale reorganization17,29.

Our key methodology involved longitudinal comparisons across amputation. This approach was designed to overcome known limitations in cross-sectional designs, where inter-participant variability could spuriously influence group comparisons, particularly when considering small group sample sizes or small effects. An important additional consideration regarding reorganization research in amputees is the difficulty to interpret whether sensorimotor activity for the missing (phantom) hand reflects preserved representation (that is, whether it reflects the same representational attributes as the physical hand before amputation), or an altered hand representation, which exhibits canonical hand representation features, albeit distinct from the pre-amputation hand. The main limitation of longitudinal designs is the contribution of any time-related effects, for example, because of changes in magnetic resonance scanning hardware30 or participants' experience (for example, familiarity with the study environment31), which are not directly related to the amputation. To account for nonrelated variables, we also scanned our case studies and Ctrl participants over a similar time frame. For two of our case studies, we had an opportunity to follow up on our procedures after an extended period (1.5/5 years after amputation). As this was not planned in the original design, we were unable to obtain related time points in our Ctrls. Therefore, all comparisons to the Ctrl cohort are focused on the 6-month post-amputation time point.

Over a 7-year period and across multiple NHS sites in the UK, we recruited 18 potential participants preparing to undergo hand amputations. Because of many factors (for example, MRI safety contraindications, no hand motor control, age outside the ethics range, high level of disability), we could only perform pre-amputation testing on six volunteers. Because of additional factors (complications during surgery, general health, retractions), we successfully completed our full testing procedure on three participants (for participant demographics, see Extended Data Table 1).

Pre-amputation scans for P1 and P2 were collected 24 h apart and within 2 weeks of their amputations. P3 had a 2.5-year gap between the pre-amputation scans due to coronavirus disease-related delays in testing and in scheduling uncertainty related to their amputation surgery. Their amputation surgery took place 3 months after their second pre-amputation scan.

There are noteworthy differences in the amputation surgeries of the three case study participants. P1 underwent an amputation to combat a rapidly developing arteriovenous malformation in the upper arm. Before amputation, they had a relatively high level of motor control in the pre-amputation hand. Additionally, P1's amputation included more advanced surgical techniques, involving a combination of targeted muscle reinnervation32 and regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces33. In these approaches, rather than simply cutting the residual nerve, the remaining nerves were sutured to a new muscle (targeted muscle reinnervation) or implanted with a nerve graft (regenerative peripheral nerve interface) (in P1's case, the technique varied depending on the muscle; Supplementary Fig. 2). P2 underwent a traditional amputation procedure to remove a sarcoma tumor that had been slowly progressing since 1995. Multiple surgeries of the arm, before the amputation, left them with restricted motor control of the fingers, although still able to move them (Supplementary Video 2). Similarly, P3 was diagnosed with Severell–Martorell syndrome, which had led to their left arm having multiple chronic bone fractures. They underwent a traditional amputation procedure, where the major nerves were left to naturally retract. It is important to note that the diversity of conditions, procedures and postoperative states across our case studies strengthen the universality of our results, which were consistent across case studies.

In addition to the case study participants who underwent an amputation, we tested a Ctrl group that included 16 older able-bodied participants (nine females; mean age ± s.d. = 53.1 ± 6.37; all right-handed). The Ctrl group also completed four functional MRI (fMRI) sessions at the same timescale as the participants who underwent an amputation and were age-matched to P2 and P3. Four additional Ctrls were recruited for this group; however, we did not complete their testing because of dropout and incidental findings captured during the MRI sessions.

Ethical approval for all longitudinal study participants was granted by the NHS National Research Ethics Committee (no. 18/LO/0474) and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (v.2013). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before the study for their participation, and for data storage and dissemination.

From three previous studies (one unpublished study and refs. 14,34), we pooled two cross-sectional fMRI datasets: (1) a group of chronic amputees (n = 26) and (2) a secondary group of able-bodied Ctrls (n = 18). The chronic amputee group included 26 upper-limb amputee participants (four females; mean age ± s.d. = 51.1 ± 10.6; 13 missing the left upper-limb; level of amputation: 17 transradial, eight transhumeral and one at the wrist; mean years since amputation ± s.d. = 23.5 ± 13.5). The secondary able-bodied Ctrl group included 18 able-bodied participants (seven females; mean age ± s.d. = 43.1 ± 14.62; 11 right-handed). For more information on these datasets, see the Supplementary Methods (https://osf.io/s9hc2/).

P1 is younger than the longitudinal Ctrl group. As such, we reanalyzed a previously collected dataset including 22 able-bodied Ctrls of a similar age to P1 (mean ± s.d. = 23.2 ± 3.8); each were scanned twice, 1 week apart on the same fMRI task and scanner35.

Because of a restricted time window for performing the tests before amputation, and the participants' high level of physical discomfort and emotional distress, we were highly limited in the number of assessments we could perform. As such, we primarily focused on the functional neuroimaging tasks. However, in addition, we collected data on multiple questionnaires and had participants perform a functional ecological task.

Kinesthetic vividness was quantified for each finger before and after the amputation (When moving this finger, how vivid does the movement feel? Please rate between 0 (I feel no finger movement) to 100 (I feel the finger movement as vividly as I can feel my other hand finger moving)).

Perceived finger movement difficulty was quantified for each finger before and after amputation (When moving this finger, how difficult is it to perform the movement? Please rate between 100 (I found it as easy as moving the homologous finger in the unimpaired hand) to 0 (the most difficult thing imaginable)).

Before and after amputation, case study participants were asked to rate the frequency of their pre-amputation limb pain or post-amputation phantom limb pain, respectively, as experienced in the last year, as well as the intensity of the worst pain experienced during the last week (or in a typical week involving pain; Extended Data Table 1). Chronic pain was calculated by dividing the worst pain intensity (scale 0–100: ranging from no pain to worst pain imaginable) by pain frequency (1, all the time; 2, daily; 3, weekly; 4, several times per month; and 5, once or less per month). This approach reflects the chronic aspect of pain because it combines both frequency and intensity36,37. A similar measure was obtained for painless phantom sensation vividness and stump pain. Participants also filled out the painDETECT questionnaire38. Additionally, before and after amputation, participants reported intensity values for different words describing different aspects of pain, quantified using an adapted version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire39. For each word, participants were asked to describe the intensity between 0 (nonexisting) to 100 (excruciating pain) as it related to each word. We used a larger response scale than standard to allow participants to articulate even small differences in their pain experience (Extended Data Fig. 1).

Before and after amputation, case study participants were asked to rate their difficulty at performing a variety of functional activities because of their upper-limb problem, quantified using the Upper Extremity Functional Index40.

To characterize habitual compensatory behavior, participants completed a task involving wrapping a present (based on ref. 41). Task performance was video-recorded but is not reported in this paper.

To qualitatively capture how participants moved when cued to perform individual finger movements, at each session, we asked participants to perform a finger movement task where we cued them to move a single finger. Case study participants were cued to perform unilateral movements of the phantom fingers and intact fingers, and then mirrored the movements of the intact and phantom fingers simultaneously. Task performance was video-recorded and is shown in Supplementary Video 2.

To test whether the intact fingers were being moved simultaneously during phantom finger movements, we invited two of the three case study participants back for a separate session to assess the kinematics of the intact fingers. The task setup and data are shown in Supplementary Fig. 4.

Each MRI session for the longitudinal cohort consisted of a structural scan, four fMRI finger-mapping scans and two body localizer scans, which we report in this article. The additional cross-sectional datasets are detailed in the Supplementary Methods.

The fMRI design was the same as a previous study from our laboratory35, although specific adaptations were made to account for the phantom experience of the case study participants who underwent an amputation (described below). Considering that S1 topography is similarly activated by both passive touch and active movement24, participants were instructed to perform visually cued movements of individual fingers, bilateral toe curling, lips pursing or resting (13 conditions in total). This was performed using PsychoPy (v.2021.1.1). The different movement conditions and rest (fixation) cue were presented in 9-s blocks, each repeated four times in each scan. Additionally, each task started with 7 s of rest (fixation) and ended with 9 s of rest.

To simulate a phantom-like tactile experience for the participants before amputation, the affected hand was physically slightly elevated during scanning such that affected finger-tapping-like movements were performed in the air. Alternatively, for the unaffected hand (before and after amputation), the individual finger movements were performed as button presses on an MRI-compatible button box (four buttons per box) secured on the participant's thigh. The movement of the thumb was performed by tapping it against the wall of the button box. For the Ctrl participants, half of the participants had the right hand elevated, performing the finger movements in the air, and the other half had the left hand elevated.

Instructions were delivered via a visual display projected into the scanner bore. Ten vertical bars, representing the fingers, flashed individually in green at a frequency of 1 Hz, instructing movements of a specific finger at that rate. Foot and lip movements were cued by flashing the words ‘Feet' or ‘Lips' at the same rate. Each condition was repeated four times in each run in a semi-counterbalanced order. Participants performed four scan runs of this task. One Ctrl participant was only able to complete three runs of the task for one of the sessions.

In each of the two body localizer scans, participants were visually cued to move each hand, imagine moving the affected (case study participants) or nondominant hand (Ctrls), in addition to actual lip, toe (on the affected side only) and arm (on the affected side only) movements. The different movement conditions and a rest (fixation) cue were presented in 10-s blocks and repeated four times in each scan.

MRI images were obtained using a 3T Prisma scanner (Siemens) with a 32-channel head coil. Anatomical data were acquired using a T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2.53 s, echo time (TE) = 3.34 ms, field of view (FOV) = 256 mm, flip angle = 7 degrees and voxel size = 1-mm isotropic resolution. Functional data based on the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent signal were acquired using a multiband gradient echo-planar T2*-weighted pulse sequence42 with the following parameters: TR = 1.5 s, TE = 35 ms, flip angle = 70 degrees, multiband acceleration factor = 4, FOV = 212 mm, matrix size of 106 × 106 and voxel size = 2-mm isotropic resolution. Seventy-two slices, with a slice thickness of 2 mm and no slice gap, were oriented parallel to the anterior commissure–posterior commissure, covering the whole cortex, with partial coverage of the cerebellum. Each of the four functional runs comprising the main task consisted of 335 volumes (8 min 22 s). Additionally, there were 204 volumes for the two imagery control scans (5 min 10 s). For all functional scans, the first dummy volume of every run was saved and later used as a reference for coregistration.

fMRI data processing was carried out using the FMRIB Expert Analysis Tool (FEAT v.6.0), part of FSL (the FMRIB Software Library, www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl), in combination with custom bash, Python (v.3) and MATLAB scripts (R2019b, v.9.7, MathWorks, including an RSA toolbox)43,44. Cortical surface reconstructions were produced using FreeSurfer v.7.1.1 (refs. 45,46) and the Connectome Workbench (https://humanconnectome.org/) software. Decoding analyses were carried out using scikit-learn v.1.2.2.

The following prestatistical processing was applied: motion correction using MCFLIRT47, non-brain removal using BET48, spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of full width at half maximum FWHM of 3 mm for the functional task data, grand-mean intensity normalization of the entire four-dimensional dataset by a single multiplicative factor and high-pass temporal filtering (Gaussian-weighted least-squares straight line fitting, with σ = 90 s). Time series statistical analysis was carried out using FILM with local autocorrelation correction49. The time series model included trial onsets convolved with a double gamma hemodynamic response function; six motion parameters were added as confound regressors. Indicator functions were added to model out single volumes identified to have excessive motion (>0.9 mm). A separate regressor was used for each high-motion volume (deviating more than 0.9 mm from the mean position). For the finger-mapping scans, the average number of outlier volumes for an individual scan, across all participants, was 1.5 volumes.

To ensure that all longitudinal sessions (Pre1, Pre2, 3 months, 6 months, 1.5/5 years) were well aligned for each participant, we calculated a structural mid-space between the structural images from each session, that is, the average space in which the images were minimally reorientated50. The functional data for each individual scan run in a session were then registered to this structural mid-space using FLIRT47,51.

We applied a general linear model (GLM) using FEAT to each functional run. For the primary task, the movement of each finger or body part (ten fingers, lips and feet, total of 12 conditions) was modeled against rest (fixation). To capture finger selectivity, the activity for each finger was also modeled as a contrast against the average activity of all other fingers of the same hand.

We performed the same GLM analysis on the six conditions of the imagery scans. To capture the selectivity of actual attempted phantom movements versus imagine phantom hand movements, the activity of the attempted hand movement was also modeled as a contrast against the imagined hand movement.

For each participant, parameter estimates of each of the different conditions (versus rest) and GLM residuals of all voxels were extracted from each run's first-level analysis. All analyses were performed with the functional data aligned to the structural mid-space.

We were specifically interested in testing changes in topography within (and around) Brodmann area 3b (BA3b). First, the structural mid-space T1 image were used to reconstruct the pial and white–gray matter surfaces using FreeSurfer's recon-all. Surface coregistration across hemispheres and participants was conducted using spherical alignment. Participant surfaces were nonlinearly fitted to a template surface, first in terms of the sulcal depth map and then in terms of the local curvature, resulting in an overlap of the fundus of the central sulcus across participants52.

The BA3b ROI was defined in the fsaverage template space using probabilistic cytotectonic maps52 by selecting all surface nodes with at least 25% probability of being part of the gray matter of BA3b53. Furthermore, for the multivoxel pattern analyses, we restricted the BA3b ROI to just the area roughly representing the hand. This was done by isolating all surface nodes 2.5 cm proximal or distal of the anatomical hand knob54. An important consideration is that this ROI may not precisely reflect BA3b for each participant and may contain relevant activity from neighboring S1 areas because of the nature of our data (3T fMRI, smoothing full width at half maximum 3 mm) and the probabilistic nature of the atlas. As such, we considered this as a definitive localizer of S1 and an indicative localizer of BA3b. Surface ROIs were then mapped to the participant's volumetric high-resolution anatomy.

To segment the BA3b into 49 segments, we loaded the fsaverage flattened cortical surface with the boundaries of the BA3b ROI, as defined by the Glasser atlas55. We rotated the map so that the central sulcus was perpendicular to the axis. We overlayed a box with 49 segments of equal height on this ROI. By masking the box to the ROI, we constructed the 49 segments of the BA3b ROI. Because this masking approach requires drawing boundary lines using the vertices on the cortical flat map, we could optimally only get 49 segments (maximum) without issues with the boundary drawing approach. These ROIs were then mapped onto the participant's volumetric high-resolution anatomy and further to the participant's cortical surfaces.

The approach for defining the motor cortex ROI was the same as described above, with the sole exception of selecting the Brodmann area 4 region.

Using the cortical surfaces generated using recon-all, fMRI maps were projected to the surface using the workbench command's volume-to-surface mapping function, which included a ribbon-constrained mapping method. The cross-sectional datasets were the only exception, where we projected all maps onto a standard cortical surface (Supplementary Methods).

To visualize the contrast maps for attempted versus imagine phantom hand movements, estimates from the two imagery control scan runs for the participant's post-amputation (6-month) session were averaged in a voxelwise manner using a fixed-effects model with a cluster-forming z-threshold of 3.1 and family-wise error-corrected cluster significance threshold of P < 0.05. Maps were then projected onto each participant's cortical surface. These contrast maps are visualized in Fig. 1c with a minimum z-threshold in both directions of 3.1.

To visualize the contrast maps for the hand and lip movements, estimates from the four finger-mapping scan runs for each session were averaged in a voxelwise manner using a fixed-effects model with a cluster-forming z-threshold of 3.1 and family-wise error-corrected cluster significance threshold of P < 0.05. Maps were then projected onto the participant's cortical surface. These contrast maps (hand in red and lips in blue) are visualized in Fig. 1d with a minimum z-threshold of 33% the maximum participant-specific z-statistic.

For completion, the boundaries of the lip maps, for all participants who underwent an amputation across all sessions, are visualized in Fig. 3d. All maps were minimally thresholded at z > 4.5 to provide a complementary thresholding approach relative to Fig. 1d.

Using the 49 segments of the BA3b (described above), we projected the neural activity for the hand (versus rest) for each hemisphere (contralateral to the hand being moved), session and participant. The average activity across all voxels in each segment was averaged to extract a single value per segment.

To quantify changes in the hand, finger or lip topography, we computed the COG of activity (for a single body part) across the 49 BA3b segments. To do this, we first computed the weighted activity (βw) across the segments. To do this each segment number was multiplied by the average activity in the segment:

To compute the COG, we then divided the sum of the weighted activity (Σβw) by the sum of the activity (Σβ).

When comparing changes in the COG for the hand or a finger, the COG for each post-session was subtracted from the average COG of the pre-sessions (for example, 3-month COG–pre. avg COG). A value greater than zero reflects the COG moving more medially in the post-session compared to the pre-session. A value less than zero reflects the post-session COG being more lateral compared to the pre-session COG.

To visualize the selectivity maps, estimates from the four finger-mapping scan runs for each session were averaged in a voxelwise manner using a fixed-effects model. When visualizing the clusters, we minimally thresholded each z-statistic at 33% the maximum z-statistic. We stacked the images such that the smallest cluster was the highest overlay (for example, the pinkie finger) and the largest cluster was the underlay. Finally, we applied a 70% opacity to the visualizations to capture multi-finger activity at each voxel.

To provide an example visualization of the activity for each of the body parts shown in Fig. 3c, estimates from the four finger-mapping scan runs for each session were averaged in a voxelwise manner using a fixed-effects model, with a cluster-forming z-threshold of 3.1 and family-wise error-corrected cluster significance threshold of P < 0.05. We then visualized the z-statistic map for the contrast of lips > feet and all left fingers > feet on an inflated cortical surface and applied a threshold to each body part (z > 3.1).

To test whether there was an increase in lip activity in the BA3b hand region, the average activity for all voxels (non-thresholded) in the ROI was computed for each session and each run. Activity was averaged across runs to compute a session estimate. When testing for a difference between the after and before amputation sessions, the activity for the two pre-amputation sessions was averaged for a pre-amputation average estimate. The activity in each post-amputation session (3 months, 6 months, 1.5/5 years) was then subtracted to the activity of the pre-amputation average.

As a qualitative demonstration of our findings been compatible with previous studies investigating cortical reorganization that used a winner-takes-all approach, we applied a winner-takes-all analysis to S1 functional activity of the case study participants who underwent an amputation. Using each participant's final post-amputation session data, we performed two variations of the analysis including the following conditions: (1) lips, hand and feet; or (2) lips and feet (excluding the hand). Each voxel was assigned exclusively to the condition with the highest activity. The resulting images were mapped to the participant's cortical surface and are visualized in Extended Data Fig. 9.

We performed several multivoxel pattern analyses that can be broadly categorized into three themes: intra-finger; inter-finger; and inter-body part. In these measures, we were interested in capturing differences within a session and differences between sessions. For all these analyses, we only included voxels in the BA3b hand region.

We first wanted to quantify changes in the pattern of activation for single fingers (intra-finger). We performed Pearson correlations on the beta weights for each finger using data from runs from different sessions (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 5). For between-session correlations, the beta weights (in our instance, contrast of parameter estimates) for each finger in the four scan runs were separated into partitions, each with two runs, and each set from different sessions. The activity in each two-run set was averaged at every voxel. A Pearson correlation was then performed between the averaged activity in each of the splits. We performed all unique two-run combinations between sessions (36 total combinations) and averaged these correlation coefficients to get a single value per finger. Between-session correlations were performed for all six unique session comparisons: Pre1 to Pre2, Pre1 to 3 months, Pre1 to 6 months, Pre2 to 3 months, Pre2 to 6 months and 3 months to 6 months. Additionally, for P1 and P2, correlations were performed for Pre1 to 1.5/5 years and Pre2 to 1.5/5 years. All correlation coefficients were then averaged and plotted in Extended Data Fig. 5. For a simpler visualization, we plotted just the first combination for each participant's final scan relative to the pre-amputation average in Fig. 2b.

We next wanted to quantify changes in the pattern of activation between finger pairs (inter-finger) using a decoding approach (Fig. 2d) and cross-validated Mahalanobis distances (Extended Data Fig. 6). Both approaches capture slightly different aspects of the representational structure56, which we elaborate on below.

For these two analyses, the beta weights from the first-level GLM for each participant were extracted and spatially pre-whitened using a multivariate noise normalization procedure (as described in ref. 56). This was done for each scan using the residuals from the GLM. We then used these noise-normalized beta weights for the next analyses.

First, we performed a decoding analysis. A strength of this approach is that it provides an estimate for chance performance (50%), that is, it is a classification accuracy significantly greater than chance. For the case study participants who underwent an amputation, the decoding approach can tell us whether a decoder trained on pre-amputated finger pairs can correctly decode the same information on a phantom hand.

We used a linear SVM classifier (scikit-learn v.1.2.2; sklearn.svm, LinearSVC) to quantify the between-session decoding for each finger pair. Default parameters were used for the classifier. Classification accuracy above chance (50%) denotes that there is some amount of shared information between the training and testing datasets.

We trained the classifier on the noise-normalized beta weights for each finger pair (ten in total). The training and testing splits were performed using data from different sessions, such that the classifier was trained on each unique two-run combination from one session and tested on all unique two-run combinations in a separate session (36 combinations for each finger pair). We performed the same classification approach in the reverse direction (72 combinations in total) because the forward and reverse directions provide unique values. The accuracies for each finger pair for each two-run combination for each training and testing direction were then averaged. Between-session accuracies are shown in Fig. 1d.

Because our decoding analysis was performed at ceiling (close to 100%), we also performed a RSA using cross-validated Mahalanobis distances. The strength of this approach is that it computes a distance measure (continuous) rather than a binary decoding measure. As such, it is arguably more sensitive for capturing the inter-finger representational structure. Larger distances reflect more dissimilar (distinct) activity patterns and smaller distances reflect more similar patterns.

We performed this analysis using data from different sessions to compute between-session distances (our desired measure for representational stability over time). A distance cross-validated between sessions captures the stability of the information content.

We calculated the squared cross-validated Mahalanobis distance between activity patterns as:

where \({\left({x}_{y}-{x}_{z}\right)}_{A}\) corresponds to the difference between the activity patterns of conditions y (for example, thumb) and z (for example, index finger) in partition A, and Σ refers to the voxelwise noise covariance matrix. We performed this procedure over all possible two-run cross-validation folds and then averaged the resulting distances across folds. There were 36 unique cross-validation folds between sessions. Note that the cross-validated distance gives you the same distance value regardless of whether it is assigned partition A or partition B. Between-session distances are shown in Extended Data Fig. 6.

To quantify a measure that represents the degree of ‘normality' of the hand representation, we computed a representational typicality measure10. For each participant's nondominant left hand, we extracted the ten crossnobis distances for the Pre-3 month and Pre-6 month comparisons. We then averaged these vectors across all able-bodied participants to get an average typical hand pattern. We then performed a Spearman rho correlation between the cross-validated Mahalanobis finger-pair distances for each participant's affected or nondominant (left) hand and the average typical hand pattern. When comparing a Ctrl participant to the Ctrl mean, the respective participant was left out from the estimation of the Ctrl mean distances. These values are depicted in Extended Data Fig. 6.

Finally, we wanted to quantify changes in the pattern of activation between the thumb, lips and feet in the S1 hand region. We computed the cross-validated Mahalanobis distances between these body parts in the same manner as the inter-finger analysis. The thumb to lips distances are plotted Fig. 3. The distances between all conditions are plotted in Extended Data Fig. 7.

All statistical analyses were performed either with Python scripts using scipy.stats and statsmodels.stats.multitest or JASP (v.0.17.2.1). Normality was ascertained using a Shapiro–Wilk test. For most of the analyses, to test whether a case study participant was significantly different from the Ctrl group, we used Crawford & Howell's method, which provides a point estimate of the abnormality of the distance of each case from a Ctrl sample57. For all Crawford tests, we report uncorrected, two-tailed P values. When comparing estimates to zero or chance decoding (50%), we used a two-tailed, one-sample t-test. When testing for a decrease in measures within-participant, we used a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. When further testing for differences between hands within-participant, we performed a Wilcoxon signed-rank test on the classification accuracy values and a paired samples t-test on the Mahalanobis distances. The resulting P values were z-transformed and are plotted in Supplementary Fig. 1. Additionally for the correlation analyses, Pearson correlations were used for the intra-finger multivoxel pattern analysis and Spearman correlations were used for the typicality analysis.

Across all our previous studies, we operationally defined amputees' intact hand as their de facto dominant hand, and as such have always compared the nondominant hand of Ctrls to the missing hand of amputees (for example, see refs. 9,14,37,41,58,59,60). Therefore, across all case study to Ctrl comparison analyses, we statistically compared (and plotted) the left (nondominant) hand side of Ctrls to the case study participants missing hand side.

(a) Affected hand sensations before and after amputation. Finger vividness and motor control for the phantom fingers, relative to the pre-amputated fingers. Kinesthetic vividness rated on a scale from 0 (no sensation) to 100 (as vivid as the unaffected hand) with color intensity indicating level. Movement difficulty rated from 100 (as easy as the unimpaired hand) to 0 (extremely difficult). Finger colors: red=D1, yellow=D2, green=D3, blue=D4, purple=D5 (palm excluded). (b) Before and after amputation, participants reported intensity values for each pain descriptive word, broadly categorized into sensations that are mechanical, temperature-related and other. For each word, participants were asked to describe the intensity between 0 (non-existing) to 100 (excruciating pain) as it relates to that particular word. A value of 100 (Max) is the largest radii on the polar plot. 3 M=3months post-amputation; 6 M=6months post-amputation. 1.5/5 yrs=1.5 or 5 years post-amputation.

Across all panels, we only report statistics when significant. Case-study participants showed similar responses to able-bodied controls in the baseline (pre-amputation) S1 center of gravity for the (a) hand and (b) lips. (c) All case-study participants had similar average intra-finger correlations between the two pre-sessions as controls. For baseline average inter-finger (d) classification accuracy and (e) distances. One case-study participant exhibited lower values for their affected hand only, relative to controls [Crawford t-test: decoding and distances: P2: p < 0.001] (f) All case-study participants had similar hand typicality between the two pre-sessions as controls. All other annotations the same as described in Figs. 2 and 3.

(a) Hand and finger univariate activity across M1 before and after amputation. When testing the stability of the whole hand condition across sessions, all case-studies fell within the distribution of controls at all timepoints. (b) When correlating voxel wise finger activity across sessions, all case-studies exhibiting similar correlation coefficients as controls, for all fingers. Please refer to the Extended Data Fig. 5 caption for a more detailed understanding of the correlation analysis. (c) Inter-finger representational structure across sessions, measured using cross-nobis distances (left) and decoding accuracies (right). First, when assessing for atypicality in our case-studies pre-amputation compared to controls, only case-study P2 exhibited reduced average finger selectivity pre-amputation based on the RSA (Crawford t-test: t(15) = -3.15, p = 0.007) and decoding (t(15) = −3.9, p = 0.001; similar to what was observed in S1). Next, when testing for reductions in average finger selectivity at the 6-month timepoint, relative to baseline, only case-study P1 exhibited a significant reduction compared to controls [cross-nobis distances: 3 comparisons; t(15) = 2.33; puncorr=0.02); decoding: 3 comparisons; t(15) = 2.32; puncorr=0.03]. However, it returned to the typical range when later assessed at the 1.5 year timepoint (for both measures). We also noted that case-study P3 showed a significant reduction at the 6-month timepoint, relative to controls, in the decoding (3 comparisons; t(15) = 2.18, puncorr=0.046), but not the cross-nobis. (d) Lips univariate activity plotted across M1 before and after amputation. (e) All case studies showed typical session to session variability as controls in (left side) the lips center of gravity across M1 and (right side) lips activity in the M1 hand region. All annotations are the same as described in the captions of the Figs. 2–3 and Extended Data Fig. 5. Across all panels, we only report statistics when significant.

(a) Intact hand and finger univariate activity across S1 before and after amputation. When testing the stability of the whole hand condition across sessions, all case-studies fell within the distribution of controls at all timepoints. (b) Unaffected (intact) hand between-session differences in inter-finger values. Difference values are depicted for the (left) cross-validated distances and (right) decoding accuracies. Classification/distance differences before and after amputation are visualized for each finger pair [Pre1-Pre2] minus [Pre Avg. – Post1 (3 m)] minus, [Pre1-Pre2] minus [Pre Avg. – Post2 (6 m)] and [Pre1-Pre2] minus [Pre Avg. – Post3 (1.55/y)]. Each violin plot reflects an individual finger pair (same order of finger-pairs as detailed in Fig. 2d). For consistency, the control values are all for the left-hand. When computing the session-to-session differences relative to controls, all case-study participants showed typical session-to-session variability in finger selectivity at the 6-month timepoint, relative to controls. (c) Longitudinal lips univariate in the unaffected hemisphere (contralateral to intact hand) across S1 before and after amputation. (d) All case study participants showed typical changes in the lips center of gravity (CoG) in the unaffected S1 hemisphere across scans, relative to controls. (e) When testing for changes in lip activity (in the unaffected hand region), one case-study, P1, exhibited a significant atypical increase in lip activity relative to controls at the 6-month timepoint (Crawford t-test: t(15) = 2.75, puncorr=0.01). However, the activity returned into the distribution of controls when tested at the 1.5 year timepoint (t(15) = 0, puncorr=0.99). All other annotations are the same as described in Figs. 2 and 3. We only report statistics when significant.

(a) Visualization depicting the inter-session Pearson correlations of individual fingers within the BA3b hand region. (b) Inter-session correlations for the left (top row) and right hands (bottom) in the contralateral hand ROI. Line colors indicate session pairings (indicated in the legend). For case-study participants, dashed line denotes the affected hand; solid line unaffected hand. Violin plots reflect able-bodied control's Pre – Post (6 m) values. (c) Between-session differences in finger correlation coefficients. Difference values are depicted for the (left) missing or non-dominant hand of controls and (right) intact or dominant hand of controls. The difference values are ordered to reflect the increasing gap between sessions: [Pre1-Pre2] minus [Pre Avg. – Post1 (3 m)] minus, [Pre1-Pre2] minus [Pre Avg. – Post2 (6 m)] and [Pre1-Pre2] minus [Pre Avg. – Post3 (1.55/y)]. Each violin plot reflects an individual finger. When testing whether the case-study participants showed a unique reduction in the average correlation, across fingers, relative to controls, for the missing hand, only P3, at the 3-month timepoint, for the missing hand (not intact), showed a significant pre-post reduction in the average correlation coefficient, relative to controls (t(15) = −2.59, puncorr=0.02). However, this difference returned to the typical range of controls when later tested at the 6-month timepoint (t(15) = −1.23, puncorr=0.23). All other annotations are as in Fig. 2. We only report statistics when significant.

(a) Graphic illustration of multivoxel pattern analyses. (b) Inter-finger multivariate analysis using cross-validated Mahalanobis (cross-nobis) distances. Line colors denote train-test/cross validation session pairs, respectively as indicated in the legend. The gray shaded area reflects able-bodied control's Pre – Post (6 m) data (95% percentile interval). (c) Classification/distance differences before and after amputation are visualized for each finger pair [Pre1-Pre2] minus [Pre Avg. – Post1 (3 m)] minus, [Pre1-Pre2] minus [Pre Avg. – Post2 (6 m)] and [Pre1-Pre2] minus [Pre Avg. – Post3 (1.55/y)]. Each violin plot reflects an individual finger pair (same order of finger-pairs as detailed in b). When comparing differences relative to controls, we observed some temporary, idiosyncratic reductions in average finger selectivity, relative to controls. First for the cross-nobis results, P1 showed a temporary reduction in average finger selectivity at 6 months (3 comparisons; t(15) = −2.79, puncorr=0.01), though later offset to the typical range at their follow-up 1.5-year scan. P2 only exhibited reduced selectivity only at the 5-year timepoint, though reduction seen in the intact hand as well (Extended Data Fig. 4). Finally, P3 exhibited reduced selectivity at 6 months relative to controls (2 comparisons; t(15) = −2.36, puncorr=0.03). For the decoding results, P2 seemed to show significantly reduced selectivity at the 5-year timepoint, though also reduced for the intact hand (Extended Data Fig. 4). (d) The representational typicality of the hand structure was estimated by correlating each session's cross-validated Mahalanobis distances for each participant to a canonical inter-finger structure (controls average). All case-study participant's typicality values fell within the distribution of controls. All other annotations are as in Fig. 2. We only report statistics when significant.

(a) Multivariate distances between the thumb, lip and feet cross-validated across sessions depicted for the right (top row) and left hemisphere (bottom) of the case-study participants that underwent an amputation and controls, contralateral to the thumb side being moved. Distances appear in the following order: (1) thumb-lips, (2) thumb-feet, (3) lips-feet. Line colors indicate session pairings (indicated in the legend). For case-study participants, dashed line denotes the affected hemisphere; solid line unaffected hemisphere. Grey shaded area reflect able-bodied control's Pre – Post (6 m) values. For the affected hemisphere of the case-study participants, all distances fell within the typical range of the able-bodied controls. (b) We also tested whether changes occurred in the multivariate hand-lip distance when performed within each of the 49 S1 segments/ All case-study participants showed similar distances across sessions, before and after amputation. All other annotations are the same as described in Fig. 2.

Participant hand and lip cortical maps – registered to a standard cortical surface – are visualized for the chronic amputee participants (top row; n = 26) and secondary able-bodied control participants who underwent the same procedures as the chronic amputees (n = 18; bottom row). Hand maps for the amputees reflect moving their phantom hand, while for controls reflect moving their non-dominant hand (in the contralateral hemisphere). All maps are contrasted against rest, minimally thresholded at 50% the maximum z-statistic and masked to Brodmann regions: 1, 2, 3a, 3b, and 4. Amputee maps are ranked by the numbers of years since amputation at the time of the scan and control maps are ranked by the participants age at the time of the scan.

Using the data from the last session of each participant, each voxel was awarded to the body-part with the highest response. Left column – we show the winner-takes-all analysis when performed on 3 body-parts: hand (red), lips (blue) and feet (green) versus (Right column) when excluding the physically absent hand. This comparison reveals supposed large-scale expansions of the lips or feet into the deprived hand region (black outline) post-amputation. We've also depicted the center of gravity (CoG) of the winner-takes-all lip cluster (white circles) to further demonstrate this. When excluding the hand activity, the CoG of the lips ‘shifts' towards the hand area. Thus, ignoring the primary body part – depending on your analysis choices – can substantially bias the results61,62. Combined with the use of cross-sectional designs, this analysis approach has led to the impression of cortical remapping and even large-scale reorganization of the lip representation following amputation. Crucially, the newly assigned winner in the hand area [left panel] has rarely been directly compared against the persistent representation of the missing hand, and indeed, indicative evidence show that this recorded activity in the hand area is weak (we extensively discuss this in our recent review ref. 17).

Requests for unnecessary citations can be coercive, suggests analysis. Credit: iStock/Getty

Reviewers are more likely to approve a manuscript if their own work is cited in subsequent versions than reviewers who are not cited, according to an analysis of 18,400 articles from four open access publications. The study, which is yet to be peer reviewed, was posted online as a preprint earlier this month.

The study was inspired by anecdotes from authors who cited articles only because reviewers asked them to, says study author Adrian Barnett, who researches peer review and metaresearch at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia. Sometimes, these requests are fine, he says. But if reviewers ask for too many citations or the reason to cite their work is not justified, the peer-review process can become transactional, says Barnett. Citations increase a researcher's h-index, a metric reflecting the impact of their publications.

These are the most-cited research papers of all time

These are the most-cited research papers of all time

Requesting unnecessary or unjustified requests for citations, sometimes called coercive citation, is generally considered poor practice. Balazs Aczel, a psychologist who studies metascience at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, says that the latest work isn't the first to investigate reviewers asking for citations, but that the number of peer reviews included and level of analysis is novel. A barrier to studying the practice is a lack of data sharing from publishers, he says.

The preprint considered articles from four publishing platforms — F1000Research, Wellcome Open Research, Gates Open Research and Open Research Europe — that make all versions of their articles publicly available, as well as reviewer comments. The publishers ask reviewers to approve articles, reject or approve them with reservations. Reviewers are also asked to explain why they ask authors to cite their own work. Of 37,000 reviews — at least two people reviewed each article — 54% of reviewers approved articles with no changes and rejected 8%. Almost 5,000 reviewed articles cited a reviewer and roughly 2,300 reviews requested a citation from a reviewer.

The analysis found that reviewers who were cited were more likely to approve the article after the first review than reviewers who were not cited. 

But reviewers who suggested that their own research be cited were about half as likely to approve the article than reject it or express reservations. In more than 400 reviews in which the reviewer was not cited in version 1 of the article and requested a citation in their review, 92% of reviewers who were cited in version 2 recommended approval compared with 76% for reviewers who were not cited.

When a reviewer rejects a paper, they and the authors know that the reviewer is probably going to evaluate any revised versions of the article, says Barnett, so authors might opt for the path of least resistance and include the citation to get their paper accepted.

Barnett also analysed 2,700 reviewer comments and identified the 100 most frequently used words. He found that reviewers who requested citation were more likely to use words such as ‘need' or ‘please' in their comments when they rejected an article, which he says suggests that coercive language was used.

Jan Feld, a metascience researcher at the Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, is not convinced that such language is a sign of coercion. “That seems like a bit of a stretch,” he says. There are other explanations for reviewers rejecting an article than the author refusing to cite their work. He doesn't doubt that reviewers request citations that are not warranted, but they can recommend citations, including of their own work, to address issues they've identified. But even after those recommendations, “if the paper has not improved or I still have concerns, I cannot recommend publication”, he adds.

From Algeria on the Mediterranean coast to landlocked Zambia in the south, countries across Africa have been importing significantly more solar panels from China this year than in the past, which analysts say could be the start of a massive effort to help meet the continent's power demands with renewable energy instead of fossil fuels.

In May 2025, African countries imported a combined 1.57 Gigawatts of solar panels from China, an all time high. (Think of it as adding three-fourths of the capacity of the Hoover Dam in one month.) Dave Jones, chief analyst at the global energy think tank Ember, notes that the spike didn't come from relatively affluent African countries like South Africa, but rather from nearly two dozen smaller nations.

Jones tracks the value of Chinese solar panels exported to different countries using Chinese customs data. In the first five months of 2025, he found at least 22 African countries imported more solar panels than they did during the same period last year, with most of them doubling the amount. One of the most striking examples is Algeria, which imported 0.76 GW of solar panels in the first half of 2025, a 6,300 percent increase from the year before.

Less developed countries, such as Chad, have imported enough solar panels to replace their country's entire current power generation capacity. “The magnitude of these numbers is just huge in context of what the current electricity grid demand is,” Jones tells WIRED.

China has dominated global solar panel manufacturing over the past decade. More than 80 percent of the world's panels are made in China, according to the International Energy Agency, thanks to government subsidies, economies of scale, and technological improvements implemented by local companies. But until recently, the bulk of these panels flowed to Europe, North America, and other Asian countries.

While overall sales to African countries are still small compared to these traditional export markets, the Global South appears to be at a turning point in how it thinks about energy. For decades, energy-starved countries largely had one default option when they wanted to add new power supply: import coal and gas. Now, for the first time, solar energy is emerging as the cheaper and greener way forward, so there's no need to sacrifice the environment for development.

What's happening in Africa right now might sound familiar, especially if you know anything about the global green energy industry. We've seen several versions of this story before, most notably in Pakistan last year.

In 2024, Pakistan installed about 15 Gigawatts of solar panels; for context, the country's total peak electricity demand is about 30 Gigawatts. Households put so many panels on their rooftops that Pakistani cities now look visibly different on satellite maps. The trend is threatening the future of Pakistan's national grid because people are using their own panels to generate power, reducing the need to buy electricity from the grid. And almost all of this happened because the country was mass-importing solar panels from its neighbor and ally, China.

A similar trend happened in South Africa in 2023. The utility infrastructure in both countries is not resilient enough to meet peak demand, causing consistent blackouts that pushed consumers to look for alternative energy sources. The government introduced policies that made solar especially attractive, like tax breaks for buying panels or paying people for transmitting excess energy to the grid.

But across the board, the main thing driving the popularity of solar is simple: the cost to purchase and install Chinese panels has gotten so low that the world has reached an inflection point. Even if a country isn't particularly worried about climate change, it simply makes economic sense to generate energy from solar, says Anika Patel, China analyst at Carbon Brief, a climate policy publication.

“A lot of African nations right now just need more electricity. And the fact that there is this option to install solar plants at a fraction of the cost of building a new coal or gas plant is attractive,” she says.

Price is an especially important factor for African countries, because it's harder to get a loan to fund a solar power plant project there than in developed countries, says Léo Echard, policy officer at the Global Solar Council and the author of a report on Africa's solar market. Since Chinese solar companies have significant price advantages over manufacturers in other countries, they are always the go-to option for supplying Africa's solar demand.

There are two types of demand driving the solar boom in African countries, Echard says. In North Africa, countries like Algeria and Egypt are building massive utility-scale solar power plants that require large numbers of panels. But in Sub-Sahara Africa, the panels are being imported by more rural communities in places that traditionally haven't been connected to the grid at all.

Just like in Pakistan, this network of distributed rooftop solar panels is transforming the energy landscape. People are getting access to energy, and that access isn't dependent on government spending or foreign loans. Instead, it spreads organically, household by household, as long as the panels are cheap enough.

Yike Fu, the climate program manager at Development Reimagined, a consultancy that specializes in tracking Africa–China climate collaborations, has witnessed this kind of off-grid adoption firsthand. When she visited Kenya's Maasai Mara National Reserve in 2023, she was surprised to see a Chinese-made solar panel in a village whose main economic activity was charging tourists entrance fees to pass through the village.

The village leader had one solar panel, smaller than the size of a TV, donated by a company from Shanghai. Other than that, the community wasn't connected to the grid at all. “The local community definitely wants to use electricity, but sometimes it's very hard or quite expensive to get to the national grid, so solar provides one solution,” she says.

Fu manages Development Reimagined's China Africa Climate Action Tracker, which compiles data on Chinese investment in African renewable energy projects. But she says her team still sometimes misses things because of how rapidly the scene is changing on the ground. When her colleagues traveled to Zambia and Botswana, Fu says they found many Chinese companies already setting up local business operations and making profits, but few people outside the region usually hear about it.

The world has reacted in two drastically different ways to Chinese-made, low-cost solar panels. Some countries, led by the United States, are using tariffs to deter the influx of Chinese panels and encourage domestic production; others, like Pakistan, are welcoming them with open arms.

For now, African countries are mostly in the second camp. For governments that struggle every day with energy shortages, the calculus is simple: cheap energy is good energy.

Some nations, however, are considering implementing policies that would help foster local assembly or small-scale manufacturing of solar panels in the hopes of ensuring that their own local manufacturing industries also benefit from the green energy transition. (Nigeria, for example, proposed and then quickly backtracked, a plan to ban solar panel imports.)

The problem is that there's almost no local solar manufacturing industry in Africa, says Elena Kiryakova, a research fellow at the ODI Global think tank who studies China's climate investment in Africa. What does exist is mostly only the assembling of individual solar cells into panels, the last step in the solar supply chain and also the one with least added value.

“From some of the conversations we had in Kenya, I think the view at the moment is that it's more beneficial to rely on cheap imports, rather than to potentially delay any meaningful action by trying to develop local industries,” Kiryakova says. “It's definitely an ongoing debate. But in practice, this reliance on Chinese solar panel imports is likely to stay.”

I asked my editors if I could go work at a tech startup. It was an unusual request. But I wanted to learn to vibe-code. My need to know felt urgent. I wanted to survive the future.

The pitch process was surprisingly easy: First my editors said yes, and then the tech startup I lobbed my wild idea to, Notion, agreed to let me embed with them. Why? It's hard to say. Possibly because Notion's own workforce has fully embraced vibe coding—“vibe” here being a euphemism for “AI-assisted.” Some tech companies have estimated that around 30 to 40 percent of their code is now written by AI.

Notion is a 1,000-person, venture-backed San Francisco startup with a $10 billion valuation. It makes the ultimate to-do and note-taking app, consisting of so many templates and tables and ways to format tasks that figuring out how to use Notion is a task in itself. On YouTube, productivity gurus attempt to make sense of Notion using the well-worn vernacular of personal optimization. One such video is titled “How to Get Started in Notion Without Losing Your Mind.” It has 3.4 million views.

I was scheduled to start at Notion as a vibe-coding engineer on a Thursday in mid-July. The night before, I found myself panic-watching these YouTube videos. Surely I would need to be a power user of the app if Notion was allowing me—an English major!—to fiddle with its code base. In an earlier onboarding call, a new coworker had encouraged me to download the AI coding platform Cursor and play around with it. I did. No real code emerged from this homework.

My desk on my first day at Notion.

Fortunately, I would be pair-programming at Notion, which meant that I'd be working alongside experienced (human) coders. Upon my arrival, Sarah Sachs, an AI engineering lead at Notion, set me up at a desk. A company tote bag and notebook awaited me. Sachs informed me that the following day, I would be presenting my work to the staff at a weekly demo meeting. Was I good with that? I said yes. We were all committed to the bit.

Sitting a few feet away was Simon Last, one of Notion's three cofounders. He is gangly and shy, an engineer who has relinquished management responsibilities to focus on being a “super IC”—an individual contributor. He stood to shake my hand, and I awkwardly thanked him for letting me vibe-code. Simon returned to his laptop, where he was monitoring an AI as it coded for him. Later, he would tell me that using AI coding apps was like managing a bunch of interns.

Since 2022, the Notion app has had an AI assistant to help users draft their notes. Now the company is refashioning this as an “agent,” a type of AI that will work autonomously in the background on your behalf while you tackle other tasks. To pull this off, human engineers need to write lots of code.

They open up Cursor and select which of several AI models they'd like to tap into. Most engineers I chatted with during my visit preferred Claude, or they used the Claude Code app directly. After choosing their fighter, the engineers ask their AI to draft code to build a new thing or fix a feature. The human programmer then debugs and tests the output as needed—though the AIs help with this too—before moving the code to production.

At its foundational core, generative AI is enormously expensive. The theoretical savings come in the currency of time, which is to say, if AI helped Notion's cofounder and CEO Ivan Zhao finish his tasks earlier than expected, he could mosey down to the jazz club on the ground floor of his Market Street office building and bliss out for a while. Ivan likes jazz music. In reality, he fills the time by working more. The fantasy of the four-day workweek will remain just that.

My workweek at Notion was just two days, the ultimate code sprint. (In exchange for full access to their lair, I agreed to identify rank-and-file engineers by first name only.) My first assignment was to fix the way a chart called a mermaid diagram appears in the Notion app. Two engineers, Quinn and Modi, told me that these diagrams exist as SVG files in Notion and, despite being called scalable vector graphics, can't be scaled up or zoomed into like a JPEG file. As a result, the text within mermaid diagrams on Notion is often unreadable.

Quinn slid his laptop toward me. He had the Cursor app open and at the ready, running Claude. For funsies, he scrolled through part of Notion's code base. “So, the Notion code base? Has a lot of files. You probably, even as an engineer, wouldn't even know where to go,” he said, politely referring to me as an engineer. “But we're going to ignore all that. We're just going to ask the AI on the sidebar to do that.”

His vibe-coding strategy, Quinn explained, was often to ask the AI: Hey, why is this thing the way it is? The question forces the AI to do a bit of its own research first, and the answer helps inform the prompt that we, the human engineers, would write. After “thinking,” Cursor informed us, via streaming lines of text, that Notion's mermaid diagrams are static images that, among other things, lack click handlers and aren't integrated with a full-screen infrastructure. Sure.

Using Claude's notes, I wrote up the request and pasted some notes from the engineering team into Cursor, like this:

Ticket: Add Full Screen / Zoom to mermaid diagrams. Clicking on the diagram should zoom it in full screen.

Notes from slack: ""mermaid diagrams should be zoom / fullscreenable like uploaded images. they're just svgs right, so we can probably svg -> dataurl -> image component if we want to zoom""

We waited. Time is inverted in the land of vibes. Projects that used to take your whole career are now done in days, while commands you expect to see executed in seconds take endless minutes. One hundred lines of AI-generated code later, mermaid diagrams were expandable.

Except, not really. They were still too small, some parts were transparent, and the margins around them needed padding; also, would this work in the app in both light mode and dark mode? I spent the next half hour iterating on these changes, with Quinn and Modi talking me through it. Thirty minutes later, we had an expandable, readable mermaid diagram.

Next I worked alongside an engineer named Lucy, who told me that instead of typing prompts into Cursor we would be using an agent from Codegen, another AI engineering tool. The assignment was simple. We would create a new skill in Notion called Alphabetize, so that when someone uses Notion AI to draft a list or table of popular dog breeds, the user can alphabetize the content with one click.

Clockwise: I'm learning the ropes with Lucy, Andy, and Brooks.

Just then, Anthropic's Claude—which was powering Codegen—suffered an outage. Sarah Sachs, who was in the room with us, received a page on her phone, like an ER doctor. She hurried out of the room. Vibe coding and alphabetizing were temporarily put on pause. Bulldogs would come before beagles until Claude was back online.

The next assignment was as open-ended as Lucy's was specific: to build whatever I wanted. The freedom was unnerving, a Rorschach test for vibe coders. What did I see when I looked at the blinking cursor? I decided that there should be a way for Notion users to draft an “intelligent” to-do list in one step. They would be able to flick open the app and type “to do reorder pet food” and Notion AI would know what they meant. I also wanted this feature to avoid duplicate items from other recent to-do lists.

I was crushing it. I was a responsible babysitter for code, watching it cascade in front of my eyes and then toddle its way into the world. Except, my logic was wrong. My to-do list hack was somehow allowing for endless duplicates instead of avoiding them. Who was to blame: me or the AI?

A product designer named Brian talked me through it. “Pretend you're talking to a smart intern,” he said. Again with the interns.

I reversed my logic and tried again, typing in more detail around how I envisioned the widget working. “That's a great idea,” Claude responded, ever the sycophant, and then got to work. Forty minutes later, the three of us had prototyped a version of my dinky little—no, I mean killer—feature. We had spent $7 to build it, according to the token counter in Claude Code. I was told other engineering projects cost much more than that, especially if coders let the AI run for hours. It was still light out when I wrapped up the first day.

On Friday morning, I showed up for the demo session. Cheese platters, in honor of a Swiss employee's birthday, awaited us in the conference room. Coders grabbed their coffees, their Celsius cans, their cups of flavored water dispensed by a Bevi machine in the kitchen.

One of the first demos was of a Notion AI agent that had been given a memory, so it could adopt a learned writing style. For kicks, another engineer had coded an app that kept track of the flavored syrups in the staff's beloved Bevi. At the end of each presentation, I was told, someone usually takes a small mallet to a xylophone. They made me the keeper of the xylophone that day. The mood was light.

When it was my turn to present, I tried to succinctly describe the few features I had vibe-coded (with credit doled out to my pair programmers). One of the managers asked a follow-up question: How long had it taken to code the changes to the mermaid diagrams, end to end?

I looked at Quinn and Modi. We tallied that our working session had been about 30 minutes, plus some 15 minutes of preliminary work Quinn had done.

“Wow,” someone in the room said.

“I dare to imagine the general public learning how to write code,” the programmer and author Ellen Ullman wrote in a 2016 essay titled “Programming for the Millions.”

The prevailing sentiment of the 2010s, of course, was that everyone could stand to learn a little code. We should throw open the doors and invade the closed society where code gets written, Ullman wrote. This was our best hope for loosening the strangle of the code that surrounds us as a society. As part of her reporting process, Ullman enrolled in three massive open online courses, or MOOCs, that promised to teach normies how to program. (I dare to imagine her eyebrow arched as she enrolled.)

“Stick a needle into the shiny bubble of the technical world's received wisdom,” Ullman urged would-be coders. “Burst it.”

Expanding a mermaid diagram or alphabetizing a list of dog breeds hardly seemed like sticking it to the coding man. But during my time at Notion I did feel as though a trapdoor in my brain had opened. I had gotten a shimmery glimpse of what it's like to be an anonymous logical god, pulling levers. I also felt capable of learning something new—and had the freedom to be bad at something new—in a semi-private space.

Both vibe coding and journalism are an exercise in prodding, and in procurement: Can you say more about this? Can you elaborate on that? Can you show me the documents? With our fellow humans, we can tolerate a bit of imprecision in our conversations. If my stint as a vibe coder underscored anything, it's that the AIs coding for us demand that we articulate exactly what we want.

During lunch on one of my days at Notion, an engineer asked me if I ever use ChatGPT to write my articles for me. It's a question I've heard more than once this summer. “Never,” I told her, and her eyes widened. I tried to explain why—that it's a matter of principle and not a statement on whether an AI can cobble together passable writing. I decided not to get into how changes to search engines, and those little AI summaries dotting the information landscape, have tanked the web traffic going to news sites. Almost everyone I know is worried about their jobs.

One engineer at Notion compared the economic panic of this AI era to when the compiler was first introduced. The idea that one person will suddenly do the work of 100 programmers should be inverted, he said; instead, every programmer will be 100 times as productive. His manager agreed: “Yeah, as a manager I would say, like—everybody's just doing more,” she said. Another engineer told me that solving huge problems still demands collaboration, interrogation, and planning. Vibe coding, he asserted, mostly comes in handy when people are rapidly prototyping new features.

These engineers seemed reasonably assured that humans will remain in the loop, even as they drew caricatures of the future coder (“100 times as productive”). I tend to believe this, too, and that people with incredibly specialized skills or subject-matter expertise will still be in demand in a lot of workplaces. I want it to be true, anyway.

Ullman's 2017 essay concludes with some disillusionment. She rightly determined the MOOCs she observed to be a mixed bag, rife with boyish men and unsupportive professors. A class on algorithm design was, she observed, autograded by primitive tools, which meant students were “trying to learn algorithms graded by faulty algorithms.” The “learn to code” movement now seems quaint. Few people could have known that in just under a decade, computers would be writing the code for them.

Ullman still found beauty in writing code, though. That's the thing. That's the thing with making anything. If you persevere, if you slog through the trough of disillusionment, “a certain fascination gets through,” she wrote. “It can be like those times you hear someone playing the piano beautifully or a sax wailing through jazz improvisations, and the sound ignites a longing in you, a desire to take up the difficulties and learn how to play that music.”

Vibe coding didn't ignite this longing in me. Instead, I saw more clearly that we're entering a dizzying age of duality in AI. Is AI going to kill our jobs or create more jobs? Yes. Did I technically build a feature in an app that has since been pushed to a hundred million users, or did I cheat my way through an assignment by leaning heavily on AI and other humans? Yes. Do I need deep foundational knowledge of software programming to be a successful coder, or can I skate by without even knowing the name of the programming language I'm using? Also yes.

In my final hours at Notion, I admitted this to Ivan Zhao, Notion's CEO. “I'm realizing that, this whole time, I didn't even ask what language we're coding in,” I said.

Ivan looked amused. “It's TypeScript. It's like a fancier version of JavaScript.” He paused. “But what language you're using doesn't matter. You express your intent on the human-language, English level, and now the machines can translate it. That's what language models are fundamentally doing.”

For Ivan, this vibe-coding moment is especially exciting. When he and Simon Last first teamed up in the early 2010s (a third cofounder, Akshay Kothari, joined later), they envisioned their product as a “no code/low code” app, to help people build things with minimal software development. They would take no code/low code mainstream.

There was just one problem: “Nobody cared,” Ivan said. “Nobody was waking up and saying, ‘I want to think about building software now.' Most people cared about ‘I just need to finish this spreadsheet for my boss.'” A few years later, they pivoted to what became Notion.

In October 2022, the founders took the entire company—then less than a few hundred employees—to an off-site in Mexico. Ivan recalled bookending the retreat with little speeches: opening remarks, then a few words at dinner on the last night. Otherwise, he and Simon were locked away in their hotel rooms, sucking down bottled water and building prototypes with this new thing they had early access to, ChatGPT. They saw what it could generate. They understood it was about to change things. On some level, they knew that their original idea for Notion had come full circle, all thanks to generative AI.

I'm pair programming with Brian, a Notion product designer who regularly vibe-codes.

Ivan, who was born in China and studied cognitive science and art during college in Canada, has an affinity for quality products. He wears a luxury watch (a gift from his wife), is obsessed with well-made furniture, and more than once remarked to me that people who excel at their jobs often have good taste. His love of good design extends to tools that help us communicate; Douglas Engelbart, the inventor of the mouse, is a hero of his.

So I had to ask: How does he feel about the quality of all this AI-generated code? Does vibe coding put more bad software into the world?

Ivan replied that code is either correct or incorrect; there's no subjective determination of whether it's high or low. The way he sees it, if I write sentences poorly then I might be considered a bad writer, but if a coder writes code poorly, the program simply won't run. AI-generated code sometimes goes off the rails, I said, pushing back. When someone's futzing around, building a website, it's low stakes; if they're vibe-coding software for actual trains, then the consequences of errors are greater.

Ivan conceded that some coders, especially younger coders, might gain a false sense of competency from vibe coding. That's where pair programming comes in, he said. Matching up less-seasoned coders with ones who learned to code before AI. “Senior-level folks—they have taste, right?” he said.

For his part, Simon says he's actually holding AI coding apps to higher standards than he does human engineers. It's why he dislikes the phrase “vibe coding.” To him, the term diminishes what these coding agents, and the humans using them, are now able to do. Simon is one of the most prolific vibe coders at Notion. He believes this is the future. At one point he was using three different AI coding tools simultaneously. He found it stressful; it was like being a manager all over again. Now he usually leans on one tool at a time.

How is he thinking about engineering jobs, then? He sighed. “I mean, at least right now, we're still super actively hiring engineers. But we do want to hire engineers that are really bullish on coding tools.” The “right now” was doing a lot of work.

These changes—this invasion of AI code—has all happened within the past four to six months. Notion even has an AI engineer assigned to its enterprise sales team now, teaching software salespeople how to use AI in their own work. And it's not just at Notion. It's everywhere. My vibe-coding experiment, while solipsistically insightful, was already behind the curve.

“The world is heating up in many ways, and the sense I have is not ‘I freed up more time' but that there's more urgency than ever to use these tools,” Simon said.

The shift both exhilarates him and makes him anxious. He told me he looks back fondly on the not-too-distant past when he was simply coding and building stuff, “when there wasn't, like, a crazy societal tidal wave happening. I think it would be crazy not to be a bit scared.”

Only after I'd left the Notion office on Friday evening did my journalistic instincts return. I had forgotten to ask: Scared of what?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Meet Wukong, the AI Chatbot China Has Installed on Its Space Station","https://www.wired.com/story/meet-wukong-chinas-first-ai-chatbot-on-a-space-station/","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 11:33:10 GMT","

The latest addition to China's Tiangong space station is an AI chatbot with expertise in navigation and tactical planning. Named Wukong AI—after the protagonist of the “Monkey King” legend in Chinese mythology, Sun Wukong—the chatbot was introduced on the space station in mid-July, and has already completed its first mission: supporting three taikonauts during a spacewalk.

Information about Wukong AI remains limited. Chinese authorities have said that they developed it from a domestic open-source AI model; according to Xinhua, China's state-run news agency, engineers designed it to meet the requirements of manned space missions, and focused its knowledge-base on aerospace flight data.

“This system can provide rapid and effective information support for complex operations and fault handling by crew members, improving work efficiency, in-orbit psychological support, and coordination between space and ground teams,” Zou Pengfei of the taikonaut training center, told Xinhua.

Technicians connected the AI to Tiangong on July 15. It began providing support a month later, this being the first time that China's space station has used a large language model (LLM) during in-orbit missions. Wukong AI assisted the crew on a six-and-a-half-hour mission, which involved taikonauts installing space debris protection devices during a spacewalk and performing a routine inspection of the station.

The taikonauts claim that their new assistant “offers very comprehensive content.” Chinese media describe Wukong AI as a classic question-and-answer system divided into two modules: one installed on the station, and one on Earth. The ground module performs in-depth analysis, while the module accompanying the crew solves immediate challenges. The combination of the two creates an advanced assistant capable of adapting to each mission.

Wukong is neither the first AI system in space nor the first on a station. The International Space Station already has Astrobee, a robot that assists astronauts with routine tasks, and CIMON, a conversational psychological support system. The particularity of Wukong AI is that it combines the functions of an intelligent assistant—like those used on Earth—with a total focus on space navigation.

The Tiangong station is the core of China's strategy to consolidate its position as a space power over the next 30 years. The station currently serves as a microgravity laboratory for experiments that would be impossible on Earth. In the future, China plans to expand it and turn it into an intermediate logistics and training platform between the moon and the Earth's surface.

And the reason for the AI's name? Sun Wukong is a mythical person who appears in the classic novel Journey to the West. In China, he symbolizes cunning, adaptability, endurance, and the pursuit of knowledge.

Good design involves technical ability, industrial know-how, creativity, innovation, adaptability, and a generous helping of luck to pull the strands together. Getting it right the first time almost never happens. Converse came close with the Chuck Taylor All-Star, of course, first launched in 1922 and barely altered since. Then there's the Sharpie marker pen, which hasn't changed since 1964.

In London, in 1975, a Cambridge engineering graduate, Andrew Ritchie, came up with a ludicrous concept for a folding bike that is now sold in 47 countries and remains fundamentally unchanged since the patent was filed. This patent, number EP 0 026 800 B1, was filed in 1979 and has long since expired.

Turning 50 this year, a Brompton looks and performs unlike any other bicycle. Its one-size-fits-all uniquely practical folding mechanism and surprisingly agile handling has amassed legions of fans, from practical parents and commuters to urban hipsters and, increasingly, the affluent Asian market, which prizes utilitarian luxury and small-space transportation.

The concept, described by Ritchie as “a magic carpet you can keep in your pocket” is a bike that folds in three stages (the current world record to fold it is 5.19 seconds), with the rear wheel swinging underneath the frame using a clever hinge and suspension block, while the front wheel folds back alongside it.

Then the handlebars and seat post collapse down, locking everything into position. To stop the chain from flopping about when the bike is folded, Brompton developed a chain tensioner that keeps it taut at all times. This unique derailleur is the keystone to its success.

It's an ingeniously compact and highly transportable cycling solution—the latest T Line titanium bike weighs 16.4 pounds (7.45 kg)—all of which are made in the UK. Located in Ealing, northwest London, the Brompton factory currently employs around 800 people and churns out 2,000 bikes a week, which are then sold in 47 countries around the world. Eighty percent of the bikes are currently exported, with Asia taking 46 percent.

On a tour of the 86,000-square-foot facility (about the size of one and a half American football fields), WIRED watched as the Brompton steel frames were hand-brazed together. This metal joining technique—requiring 18 months of in-house training, and a feature on every variety of Brompton since 1975—uses melted brass to glue the steel together, rather than melting the steel in traditional welding.

Hand-brazed Brompton frames ready for assembly.

“It requires a lower, safer working temperature,” explains manufacturing engineer Alex Watkins. “It's more durable and not only allows a little more spring in the duct—handy on pot-holed roads—it means we can work to the tight tolerances needed for the folding mechanism.” Brazing joints are also smoother, neater and prettier.

Watching the 50th Anniversary C Line Brompton production line, Watkins explains that, “with 19 stations taking one minute and 38 seconds each, we can build a Brompton in 30.2 minutes, or 313 per day.” In contrast, it took Andrew Ritchie almost 10 years to turn his initial idea—inspired by a clunky bike from the OG folding-bike brand Bickerton—into a commercially viable vehicle.

An early Brompton prototype is on display in the factory, and the fold mechanism and derailleur, while rough and ready, are already there. But it's the first production model from 1986 that's most striking. Aside from a different folding clip and a marginally more acute bend in the frame, it looks every bit the modern Brompton.

Which brings us neatly to the challenge WIRED has set the engineers at Brompton. Gathering dust in the back of this writer's shed is his wedding gift to his wife. A Brompton. Bought secondhand 15 years ago as a “project,” dogs and a family soon scuppered that idea. Given how fundamentally unchanged the design is since conception, could the boffins at Brompton salvage this bike, or even bring it up to date?

WIRED's 30-year-old Brompton bike ready for its facelift.

A quick check of the serial number reveals that the wedding Brompton actually left the factory in August 1995. That's 30 years ago, and just 9 years after the brand's first full production run. Despite its being one of the first 12,000 made, Valentino Pala, prototyping engineer, is optimistic. “It's in excellent condition for such an old bike, and since we've not altered the specific dimensions of the frame, we should be able to simply swap out old components for new.”

And that's precisely what happens. A quick blowtorch to the back frame loosens the bolts, and Pala is able to swap the original part for a state-of-the-art titanium rear triangle in just a few minutes. Instead of the original hefty old Sturmy-Archer three-speed gearing, Brompton has developed its own new 12-speed system, which has a mini four-speed cassette on the outside, and three in the internal hub.

“Because the dimensions are the same, we're going to be able to strip the bike back completely,” enthuses Pala. “We're then going to rebuild it around the main frame and fork.”

Now, while WIRED appreciates this is going to be a Brompton stowed safely on the Ship of Theseus, it remains an impressive, decade-spanning example of good design, and the importance of considered, rather than reactionary upgrades.

Before…

… after.

This sort of advanced-level repairability is par for the course for Brompton, and if you have your own tired old folding bike, every nut, bolt, bracket, and accessory is available to order. If bike maintenance isn't something you're comfortable with, there's a detailed list of all Brompton stores and authorized dealers on the company's website, with around 150 across the USA. In the UK, especially around London, there's plenty of scope for repairs, and Brompton offers a complete service at one of its dealerships for £295 (less than $400.)

It's this familiarity of design and attention to detail that has transformed the bicycle company into something of a global luxury brand. It's a bike for people who wouldn't necessarily call themselves cyclists, with a uniform in some countries that's more Lacroix than lycra.

“We're very globally spread out,” says Will Carleysmith, Brompton's chief design and engineering officer. “The UK is our most commuter-focused audience, but it represents just 16 percent of our business—the rest of what we make goes overseas, with China taking 40 percent of our sales, interestingly with a 50-50 male/female split.”

In Asia, the Brompton is viewed quite differently than in the UK, where it's typically seen as a practical tool for urban commuting. “It's a super social, highly desirable tool that's much more about self-expression,” claims Carleysmith. Collaborations are helping to underline this “style” narrative, too, with the likes of Barbour, Palace Skateboarding, Liberty London, Tour de France, LINE Friends, and art collaborations with Crew Nation and cultural luminaries including Radiohead, Phoebe Bridgers, and LCD Soundsystem.

But like any good 50th birthday, there have been both happy and sad tears. In 2022, Brompton sold its 1 millionth bike. During Covid lockdown, demand increased five-fold, but as a result of supply chain and shipping bottlenecks, rising costs, and heavy investment in new designs, pretax profits plunged by 99 percent to just $6,335 (£4,602, or roughly the cost of a single Brompton T-Line One Speed) for the year ending March 31, 2024.

It's not the only cycling brand faced with post-Covid cash flow issues, but rather than being stuck with excess stock, its financial woes have been thanks to a global drop in demand and heavy investment, first with the Brompton Electric range and the bigger, 20-inch all-terrain G Line, which WIRED tested at launch.

Brompton folding bikes are now sold in 47 countries, yet the design remains practically unchanged since the original patent was filed in 1979, one that has long since expired.

This multifunctional bike, deliberately designed to tempt the small (10 percent) but growing US audience, offers compact convenience that can finally escape the city. “With the G Line, you can genuinely ride it off-road,” says Carleysmith. “We purposely made it look bigger and more capable, too, but still with the Brompton fundamentals.”

It's clear that Brompton doesn't have it all its own way and is adapting to keep pace with aggressive competition. Tern offers a range of electric, cargo, and folding bikes, including the impressively compact 20-inch BYB (from $1,849). LA-based Dahon, which manufactures in China, claims the title as the world's largest folding-bike brand. Its latest design is the K-Feather, a 26-pound folding ebike with built-in battery that costs just $1,199.

Hand-built in Oregon, Bike Friday has 12 distinctly different folding designs, including a tandem. And then there's the influx of Chinese brands such as Fiido, HIMO (by Xiaomi), and Engwe all offering folding electric options at low pricing.

The most notable aspect of the list above is the number of electric folding bikes, something evident on WIRED's tour of Brompton's R&D facilities. “Electric is the future for most markets, and it's not a case of if, but when they will adopt it,” says Carleysmith. “Germans bought 2.1 million ebikes last year. Germany is an electric market now.” Indeed, ebikes now outsell regular models in Germany. In contrast, the entire US bought 1.7 million ebikes, and the UK, just 140,000 last year.

Good for another 30 years? More than likely.

But being Brompton, and being well versed in doing things differently, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, its R&D budget is being spent on developing its own proprietary electric bike platform, bringing together technical improvements, connectivity, batteries, and motors, so they can continue to innovate around their original folding mechanism.

As for the new 30-year-old Brompton, the titanium parts have stripped away excess weight, it folds as smoothly as any new design we've tested, and despite having 12 gears, it's easy enough to carry on public transport, and impressively nippy to ride.

The big question for this writer is whether he will be able to get another upgrade in time for his ruby wedding anniversary.

Not long before he decided to leave NASA, Steve Rader, an engineer who spent 36 years at the Johnson Space Center, held a retreat for leaders in his department at his home in downtown Houston. It had been a trying few months for Rader and his team. “I will say, I don't cry a lot,” he tells me in a recent phone call. That changed after Trump took office. “You can ask my wife, from the first few months I cried.”

After decades working on projects like the Space Shuttle and International Space Station, Rader had, since 2021, been leading an office on open innovation, tasked with bringing outside ideas and talent into NASA. But in the early days of Elon Musk's Department of Government Affairs (DOGE), the atmosphere inside the agency was heavy with sadness and paranoia. Everyone was thinking of leaving, afraid they were going to be fired, or both. “It was crazy,” Rader says. “Every day, some new person would be like, ‘Oh, just message me on Signal.' It became the de facto way people talked.”

By the time Rader met with his leaders last winter, an email had already gone out offering more than 2 million federal employees, including those at NASA, the option to resign while still getting paid through September. Rumors were swirling that the president was planning to impose huge cuts to NASA spending. At the same time, no one was really talking at work about their own plans. “I think leaders especially didn't want to influence other people into leaving,” Rader said.

That's what made what happened next so shocking. There were 10 people at Rader's apartment. They were, in his description, “the hardcore NASA people”—the kind of ultra-qualified, hyper-driven leaders who could work anywhere, for just about any salary, but still chose the federal government. Right at the start of the meeting, half of them announced they were leaving. Some of them, like Rader, were near retirement. Others were much younger, members of what should have been the next generation of NASA leadership. “One of them, her and her family are moving to Costa Rica,” Rader says. “That's how scared she is of what's going on.”

As the winter bore on, more and more top officials walked out the door. “A lot of them tried to hang on for a long time, but most of them are gone,” Rader said. Eventually, Rader himself decided to pull the plug. He retired from NASA in February. He'd already been thinking about stepping away sometime in the next couple of years. But the changes at Trump's new NASA accelerated his timeline. “I've gotten to know people all around the agency throughout the years,” he says. “And I just started hearing these reports, and it was like, I don't want to be a part of this.”

This isn't politics, Rader says, not for him, not for the vast majority of his colleagues. If you work at NASA long enough, you get used to swings of ideology and priorities as different administrations come and go. This is something bigger, something unprecedented. “It was NASA's being deconstructed,” Rader says. The American space agency—the one that put humans on the moon, that landed robots on Mars, that sent a probe past Jupiter into the Kuiper Belt and beyond—was being taken apart.

“It's just very sad, and it's kind of pointless,” Rader says. “And I think they're going to look back at it in a couple of years, maybe less, and go, ‘Oh my gosh, what did we do?'”

No one I spoke to for this piece thinks NASA is literally going away. For one thing, Congress is pushing back on the changes, though the administration seems determined to ram them through one way or another. Instead, what they imagine is a kind of rump agency. “The sense that I got was, it was a very real possibility that NASA could be reduced to something just kind of in name only,” Rader says. “Almost maybe a version of the FAA (the Federal Aviation Administration), but for space.”

“It's like witnessing a death of an ideal.”

What's being undercut isn't just NASA's technical ability to carry out missions, although that would be bad enough. It is America's—and the world's—capacity to wonder, to believe, to know. “It's almost like a diminution of our own vision and ambition to say we're literally, I mean, again, not figuratively, literally, closing our eyes to the cosmos and turning inwards,” says Casey Dreier, the space policy chief at the nonprofit Planetary Society. “It's like witnessing a death of an ideal.”

That death is already underway. Around 4,000 NASA staffers are scheduled to leave the agency this year, either through what the Trump administration calls “deferred resignation”—a kind of delayed, voluntary layoff—or what NASA is branding “normal attrition,” which includes people like Rader who are leaving of their own accord. That represents about a quarter of the agency's total staff and includes more than 2,000 senior leaders, according to a report in Politico.

(In a statement, Cheryl Warner, NASA's news chief, said safety “remains a top priority for our agency as we balance the need to become a more streamlined and more efficient organization and work to ensure we remain fully capable of pursuing a Golden Era of exploration and innovation, including to the moon and Mars.”)

The administration, meanwhile, has proposed a 2026 NASA budget that would slash overall agency spending by 24 percent and science spending specifically by almost half. “This is the largest single-year cut as a percentage ever proposed to NASA,” Dreier says. “It would bring NASA's overall resources, adjusted for inflation, down to a level not seen since before the first humans went into space in 1961.”

The Trump proposal projects a frozen NASA budget until at least 2030 even as the administration touts a new “golden age of innovation and exploration.” To cap it off, NASA has been without a full-time administrator—the agency's top official—since January. Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary and a former champion lumberjack and Real World cast member, has been doing double duty in the role on an interim basis since July.

Much has been written about what the proposed budget cuts and job losses will do to NASA. To begin with, they would mean the end of 41 planned or current missions, according to the Planetary Society. Those include an audacious, and long-underway plan to gather pristine soil samples on Mars and return them to earth, a probe exploring the solar system beyond Pluto, and a lander set to catch and study a giant asteroid that will barely miss the earth in 2029. They would also force NASA to essentially get out of the business of tracking climate change.

In a statement to WIRED, Duffy said, in part, that NASA “remains committed to (its) mission” and that the agency “retains a strong bench of talent … capable of executing upon my directives safely and in a timely manner.”

But few of his employees seem to believe that's true. In July, more than 300 NASA staffers signed a public letter of dissent addressed to Duffy. Titled “The Voyager Declaration,” the missive decried the “rapid and wasteful” changes of the past six months, that have “undermined (NASA's) mission and caused catastrophic impacts on NASA's workforce.”

I've been writing about Trump since the Iowa Caucuses in 2016. I've become used to the idea of bad news—of cruelty, incompetence and needless suffering. I know NASA cuts are not the worst thing happening under his administration. (Foreign aid cuts could resurrect the AIDS epidemic; children are being locked up in immigration jails; Medicaid is now at risk for millions.) But slashing NASA seems to represent something different and more ethereal to me. It's less an accretion of new bad, perhaps, than an absence not just of good but of the possibility of good.

What depresses me most, as a non-American, is what seems like the end of the American desire to look outward, just to look. One of the great pleasures of my life since the late days of the pandemic has been to lose myself in the images captured by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. Like so many others, I was living what felt like a tiny life back then. Everything was enclosed. Everything felt fractured. The highlight of my days, day after day, was a walk, by myself, through empty streets. James Webb, launched at the end of 2021, seemed like such a deliberate act of reaching out. It had an unabashed, unqualified bigness. It was proof that together we could still do incredible things.

I'm not a science journalist. I'm not even a committed space guy. (I've always been a different kind of nerd, more novels and tote bags than slide rules and telescopes.) But I have found something deeply, gloriously human about the images I've seen from Webb. Every time a new batch gets released, I find myself staring at them with something near spiritual awe. Sombrero Galaxy. Phoenix Cluster. Cat's Paw Nebula. They all exist in these infinite, depthless swirls—beautiful proof that if we want to we can look and look forever and always find something new to see.

That looking is what has allowed NASA to build itself as a brand in the global imagination. “Not to do too much play on the Make America Great logo,” Rader tells me. “But it is indisputable that one of the things that makes America great in many, many people's minds all around the world is that we have and pay for NASA.” I, a Canadian, have a NASA Mars rover bumper sticker on my car. (Sorry Canadian Space Agency). Sixty-seven percent of Americans, meanwhile, viewed NASA favourably in 2024, according to Pew Research, including 62 percent of Republicans. That ranks behind only National Parks and the Postal Service in terms of bipartisan approval.

I bought that bumper sticker after watching—along with, to date, more than 17 million others—NASA's Perseverance rover land on Mars in February 2021. Perseverance has been roaming the landscape of the Jezero Crater ever since, extracting soil samples aimed at finding proof of extraterrestrial life. The Trump administration, as part of a wholesale abandonment of Mars Sample Return, wants to strand those samples where they are. “The value of these, I think, is inescapable, and they are sitting there in tubes,” Harry “Hap” McSween, who has spent decades working with NASA on Martian exploration, tells me. “I'm trying not to be depressed about it, but it's hard to see something that you've worked so hard for put on the back burner, at least, if not not to be done at all.”

The worry is that the damage being caused now, not just to the brand, but to the actual agency, is permanent. NASA is already losing its reputation as a place brilliant people can go, not to make the most money or get the best stock options, but to work on things no one else has done. Rader spent years helping perfect the software required to transfer data seamlessly between NASA teams on the ground and in space. He spent some of his final days at NASA complying with one of Trump's executive orders. “I had to go into my employees' job descriptions and delete the words “diversity” and “inclusion,” he says.

By and large, the scientists and senior leaders fleeing NASA now—voluntarily and not—won't come back. They'll go to the private sector. They'll go to other countries. They'll take what's left of America's dwindling capacity to inspire with them. “We had built something, have built something, as a nation so unique in the course of history,” Dreier says. “It's kind of astonishing, when you think about it, the level of not just ambition, but willingness to say, we're going to go and figure out what the universe looked like within years of its existence. Or we're going to land a car-sized rover on Mars. Or we're going to go to the furthest outreaches of the solar system and then some. And why? Not for domination, not for glory, but for this joint collective desire to know our cosmos better.”

One of my favorite images from the James Webb Space telescope is of the Southern Ring Nebula. Released in the summer of 2022, the picture seems almost contained at first. It's an ocean-blue egg surrounded by halos of orange dust and gas. But zoom in and entire galaxies appear: infinite pinpricks of light set off against a kind of colossal orange cloud. I see in that picture the best of what NASA was and the opposite of what it risks becoming. It is an ambition at once humble and endless, rooted in the idea that we can learn anything, see anything, but we will never know everything. There's too much of it. It is too vast.

The laptop you bring to college is important. Not only is it the device you'll be using through some of the most formative years of your life, but it's also often the one that you'll take to your first job, too. The problem is that the internet is full of laptops that aren't worth the money, especially if you're scrolling through lists of laptops on Amazon or Best Buy.

Good news! I've tested each of the following laptops and can wholeheartedly recommend them. More than that, I've been digging through the deals to find the best prices on the best laptops you can buy for back-to-school season. Below, you'll find lots of good cheap laptops as well as some great Chromebooks and gaming laptops that'll do just as well for schoolwork. You can even find some deals on laptop accessories.

Updated August 21, 2025: We've added the M1 MacBook Air and added a FAQ section.

Apple

Amazon (13-inch)

Amazon (15-inch)

Best Buy

Apple

If there is a quintessential college laptop, it's the MacBook Air M4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). It's been that way for many years. And even as Apple Silicon has transformed the MacBook Air into something far more capable, Apple has kept prices low enough to still make it the go-to choice. Right now, the starting configuration at Amazon is cheaper than it was on Prime Day at $800. That's even cheaper than the student discount offered by Apple.

What makes the MacBook Air such a perfect college laptop is its long battery life and portability. It's still one of the thinnest laptops you can buy, at 0.44 inches thick, and it weighs just 2.7 pounds. It's the kind of device that can go with you across campus and last well into the evening of studying all on a single charge. You can choose between the 13- and 15-inch models, both of which are nearly identical, except the latter has more screen real estate and better speakers.

Dell

Dell

Amazon (258V)

When I initially tested the Dell 14 Plus (6/10, WIRED Review), I gave it a hard time because of the $1,100 MSRP. But over the past month or so, Dell has kept a pretty generous discount intact. Right now, the starting configuration costs $750, which might not sound that cheap at face value, but when you consider what you're getting, you realize just how good a deal this is.

First off, that $750 gets you a whopping 1 terabyte of storage and a higher-resolution display (2560 x 1600), matching the MacBook Air in sharpness. It can even match the MacBook Air's battery life claims. And no, while it's not as thin or sleek as the MacBook Air, in exchange, you get extra storage and more ports, making this my go-to pick for back-to-school season this year.

Asus

Amazon

Asus

Best Buy

The Asus Vivobook 14 (6/10, WIRED Review) has been my favorite budget laptop to come out this year, namely because it solves one of the main problems with laptops in this price range: battery life. It runs on Qualcomm's Snapdragon X chips, bringing fantastic efficiency to devices as affordable as the Vivobook 14.

It's not a perfect laptop. The display isn't too bright, and the colors look off on it. I also wish the touchpad were a bit more precise. But at this price, you won't find a better Windows laptop, especially since it comes with 512 GB of storage. If you can afford the extra cash for the Dell 14 Plus listed above, it's worth it for the improved display and bump in storage.

Microsoft

Amazon

Microsoft

2-in-1 laptops (otherwise known as detachables) are a great option for college. They're the lightest devices you can carry around that still give you access to a full version of Windows. The 2025 12-inch model of the Surface Pro makes this benefit even stronger, shrinking the screen down, but without losing performance or battery life. Due to its size, the Surface Pro 12 (6/10, WIRED Review) is a pure joy to use.

When it came out, it was too expensive compared to the larger 13-inch model, but on sale, it makes for an ideal college companion for note-taking in class and studying on the go. Just remember: You'll need to buy the keyboard, as it doesn't come bundled in.

Razer

Razer

The Razer Blade 16 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite gaming laptop, and it'd be a fantastic pick for college students if only it weren't so incredibly expensive. Normally, it starts at $2,400 for the RTX 5060 model, but Razer has a $400 back-to-school discount, meaning you can pick one up for as low as $2,000. I know that's not cheap, especially for this graphics card, but for a Razer Blade, it's a rare discount. This is certainly the lowest price I've seen since the 2025 model came out. The 5070 GPU model is also on sale.

The draw to something like the Razer Blade 16 is that it can function as both your laptop for college work and a gaming device with your friends in the dorm. While you could buy just about any gaming laptop and pretend it's a school device, lugging that thing to class will be a nuisance, and once you get there, the design might be a distraction. The latest Razer Blade 16 is just 0.58 inches thick, making it surprisingly portable for a 16-inch gaming laptop. Outside of the Razer logo on the lid, you might not guess that it's even a gaming laptop. It goes without saying that because it has a discrete GPU, it'll serve as a good option for STEM students who need more performance.

Samsung

Best Buy

Samsung

Now, if you want a more elevated Chromebook experience, you'll have to pay a little more. But as the price of the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus (8/10, WIRED Recommends) proves, there are plenty of great deals to be found. The Galaxy Chromebook Plus has a superb OLED screen, something that's not common in Chromebooks, even those with the “Chromebook Plus” designation.

The Galaxy Chromebook Plus not only has a bright, 15.6-inch OLED display, but also the kind of high-end specs you'll most likely need for college. That includes 256 GB of storage, 8 GB of RAM, and an Intel Core 3 processor. Perhaps its most attractive quality, however, is its portability. It's the thinnest Chromebook you can buy at 0.46 inches thick—only a hair thicker than the MacBook Air.

Apple

Walmart

Amazon (Renewed)

You've always been able to buy cheap, old MacBooks, but not good ones. And not ones that are still new, as in, not refurbished. But for years now, Walmart has been selling new versions of the 2020 MacBook Air M1, a nearly five-year-old laptop that has held up surprisingly well. While it uses an older design and has some outdated elements, this laptop is still solid in the places that matter most, such as the display, performance, and battery life. The M1 was a game changer when it launched, and while the later chips have made significant improvements, the original M1 greatly extended the battery life of the MacBook Air.

I should note that rumors have pointed to a cheaper MacBook coming out later this year or early 2026, targeting a similar price. That will likely be a better option when they launch, so if you can wait a few months, you should. But if you need something for school now, I don't think you'll regret picking up one of these ultra-cheap MacBooks.

Asus

Best Buy (RTX 4060)

If you want the sleek and minimalist design of the Razer Blade at a lower price, take a look at the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). It's just as gorgeous and thin and doubles every bit as well as a study laptop. The RTX 4060 configuration is what's cheap, which, admittedly, isn't the most impressive gaming GPU at the moment. Alternatively, you can also pick up a slightly older Intel model that comes with a more powerful RTX 4070 for the same price.

Either way, what you're getting is an extremely capable laptop with some extra performance behind it for those who need it. And yeah, it's also a killer gaming laptop in your downtime.

Microsoft

Amazon

Microsoft

Best Buy (13.8-inch)

Best Buy (15-inch)

This was my favorite new laptop of 2024, and almost a year later, it's still without a doubt one of the best laptops you could bring to school. The Surface Laptop 7th Edition (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is light and portable, has a fantastic screen, and an excellent touchpad. My favorite feature is the 3:2 aspect ratio display, which means it has a taller shape, giving you more vertical screen space to work with than most other laptops.

The cheapest version you can buy is over on Amazon, where you can pick up the 1-TB model. It's $999 right now, and it will get you great performance with the Snapdragon X Elite chipset and all-day battery life.

Is Now a Good Time to Buy a Laptop?

Yes. Retailers and laptop manufacturers know that parents and students alike are shopping for new, affordable laptops during August, which is why we see so many significant discounts right now. There are a few big sale seasons each year for laptops, including Prime Day and Black Friday, and back-to-school season is certainly counted among them.

Many laptops launch earlier in the year and have now been out for a number of months, which is often when the deepest discounts come. The M4 MacBook Air, included here, is a great example. It launched at $999, and we saw that price drop to around $899 shortly after. It was then moved to $849 for Prime Day in July, and now it's reached its rock bottom price of $799.

What Is the Most Reliable Place to Buy a Laptop?

When it comes to reliability and customer service, it's always good to stick with first-party retailers. They often give you the broadest range of customization and configuration, and also offer direct warranties with the company. That's true, whether we're talking about Dell, Lenovo, or Apple.

Buying a laptop through a third-party retailer like Amazon or Best Buy can provide you with better deals, but you need to be more careful. You'll need to read through the tech specs diligently, ensuring that you're getting exactly what you pay for. Similarly, you'll want to inspect the product you receive carefully too. The last thing you want to do is pay for something you didn't actually get.

What Are the Best Laptop Brands?

Right now, Lenovo is the top laptop brand in the world. That's true in terms of market share, but also in terms of the scale and quality of laptops the company produces. We're big fans of the company's approach to both consistency and experimental innovation in laptop design.

Asus is a favorite laptop brand of ours too, known for both high-value laptops and experimentation. The company is always putting out interesting models that either challenge their competitors in terms of price or innovate on being the first to market for advanced technology.

Dell and HP are the two other major players to mention, both of which also make reliable laptops for a wide variety of prices. But remember, all these Windows-based laptop companies make a large percentage of their PC sales in the enterprise world. When it comes to the consumer market, Apple's MacBooks have the biggest piece of the pie. MacBooks are known for being incredibly reliable and well built, with long software support directly from Apple.

Are Chromebooks Worth It?

Absolutely. In fact, if you're shopping under $500, it's highly recommended. You can find some decent Windows laptops at $600 or $700, but once you get below the $500 mark, the Windows laptops tend to make considerable compromises that result in a very poor experience. That's especially true when you get down to $200 or $300.

Chromebooks, on the other hand, specialize in being ultra-cheap laptops that don't feel quite as junky. There are a number of laptops under $300 that will get you through school just fine without too many problems. There are also more premium options under the ""Chromebook Plus"" banner that have nicer screens and better specs, some of which we recommend here.

You might be wondering if Chromebooks will be compatible with all the software you'll need for school, and in most cases, the answer is yes. Unless you need to run industry-specific applications, most educational software will run in web apps just fine, especially since Chromebooks have become so common in schools.

How Much RAM Should a Laptop Have?

Many Windows laptops (and MacBooks) have moved to 16 GB as the new standard. Even entry-level laptops have begun to start at 16 GB, which is a great change. If you're looking at a slightly older laptop that only has 8 GB, I wouldn't necessarily write it off. Just know that the trend toward 16 GB in the past year or so has often come without a price increase, meaning that opting for an 8-GB laptop at this point needs to be appropriately cheap. A good example is in Chromebooks, where 8 GB is considered enough.

The only reason to upgrade to 32 GB or more is if you're going into a STEM field and need the extra memory to run certain applications. If you're a hardcore gamer, 32 GB could be useful as well. Everyone else should be just fine with 16 GB. For more information on what important specs to consider, take a look at our deep dive on How to Choose the Right Laptop.

REDMOND, Wash. — Eighteen people were arrested on the Microsoft campus Wednesday afternoon, including some current and former employees, as protesters continued to escalate their campaign against the company over its role in providing technology to Israel. 

It was the second straight day of protests by members of the group No Azure for Apartheid. The group is calling on Microsoft to cut all ties to the Israeli military and government, alleging that the company's technology is being used in the surveillance, starvation and killing of Palestinians in Gaza.

Redmond police said they were dispatched around 12:15 p.m. to the plaza of Microsoft's East Campus. Protesters poured red paint on the large Microsoft sign, symbolizing blood. They also used tables and chairs to form a barrier on a nearby pedestrian bridge, according to police.

In contrast with a protest Tuesday, when the group dismantled their encampment after police warned them of imminent arrest, members of the group refused to leave, resisted and “became aggressive,” police said in a statement. 

There was a large law enforcement presence, as Redmond police were joined by Washington State Patrol, Bellevue Police, and Kirkland Police. The arrests were for charges including trespassing, malicious mischief, resisting arrest and obstruction. Police said no injuries were reported.

One of those arrested was Hossam Nasr, a leader of the group who was fired from Microsoft last year after an earlier protest on the Redmond campus, for what the company described as violations of its policies designed to prevent workplace disruption.

Abdo Mohamed, an organizer of the group who was also fired by Microsoft last year, said after the protest Wednesday that the “escalations will continue” as long as Microsoft is “embedded in the Israeli economy of genocide and apartheid” against Palestinians in Gaza. 

He said Microsoft seemed to be showing more outrage over red paint and relocated chairs than over its technology's alleged role in the killing and starvation of Palestinians in Gaza.

In a statement, Microsoft said the group “engaged in vandalism and property damage” after returning to campus for a second day. The company accused protesters of disrupting and harassing local small businesses at a lunchtime farmer's market for employees, and taking their tables and tents. 

“Microsoft will continue to do the hard work needed to uphold its human rights standards in the Middle East, while supporting and taking clear steps to address unlawful actions that damage property, disrupt business or that threaten and harm others,” the company said.

The company reiterated its commitment to its human rights standards and noted it is “pursuing a thorough and independent review of new allegations” regarding the use of its Azure platform in the surveillance of Palestinians in Gaza.

Microsoft announced Aug. 15 that it had hired the law firm Covington & Burling LLP to lead the review after reports in The Guardian and other outlets alleged Israeli forces used Microsoft servers as part of the mass surveillance of Palestinians. The company said the report contained “additional and precise allegations that merit a full and urgent review,” and noted that it would publicly release the findings. 

In past statements, Microsoft has said it complies with its human rights commitments, and that its contracts with Israel's Ministry of Defense are standard commercial agreements, governed by its terms of service and AI Code of Conduct. 

Earlier this year, Microsoft said internal and external reviews found no violations. However, the company at the time also acknowledged its limited visibility into how its technology is deployed on private or on-premises systems.

Sustainability: News about the rapidly growing climate tech sector and other areas of innovation to protect our planet. SEE MORE

More than three months after announcing layoffs and issuing a public letter asking for money, General Fusion today shared that it has raised $22 million and added board members. 

In a message titled “A New Day for General Fusion,” General Fusion CEO Greg Twinney said the company “has secured new funding to return to growth and continue to progress toward commercial fusion energy.”  

General Fusion aims to produce clean energy by generating plasma and smashing together light atoms — replicating the reactions that power the sun and stars. The pursuit has become increasingly urgent as artificial intelligence and increased electrification of the economy drives up demand for clean power.

The British Columbia-based company has been chasing fusion for 23 years and recently began operating a demonstration reactor called the Lawson Machine 26. The LM26 device is located in Richmond, B.C., and is half the size of the company's planned commercial reactor. Twinney reports that the machine is generating plasmas, which are super hot, ionized gases needed for fusion.

One year ago, General Fusion shared news of $15 million in new funding. But in early May, its CEO disclosed that the effort was at “one of the most challenging financial moments in our history.” 

The Globe and Mail reported at the time that a quarter of the company's workforce was let go and the company needed $125 million to continue its work. Prior to the layoffs, the business employed roughly 140 people.   

Including the new funding, General Fusion has raised about $366 million through government grants and investments. The company is backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and this spring added Bob Smith, former CEO of Bezos' Blue Origin space venture, as a strategic adviser.

Bezos was not listed as an investor in this latest round, which included Segra Capital, PenderFund, Chrysalix Venture Capital, Milfam, Jimco, Gaingels, Thistledown Capital, Presight Capital and Hatch. 

Adam Rodman of Segra Capital and Kelly Edmison of the PenderFund are joining the company's board of directors. 

General Fusion previously set a goal of reaching 100 million degrees Celsius with LM26 by this year, and had aimed by 2026 to hit an energy-producing target of “scientific breakeven equivalent.” That milestone is an intermediate benchmark towards commercial energy production and was first reached by the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 2022.

None of the commercial efforts have accomplished this goal, though many have set and missed the milestone. General Fusion originally aimed to hit scientific breakeven in 2006.

Washington state's Helion Energy has the most ambitious timeline for commercialization, aiming to start producing fusion energy in 2028 at a reactor being built on the Columbia River. The Eastern Washington project — which is supposed to serve Microsoft data centers — broke ground in July.

Other Pacific Northwest fusion efforts include Avalanche Energy, Zap Energy, Kyoto Fusioneering, Altrusion and ExoFusion. 

General Fusion said in a release issued today that it plans to deliver fusion power to the grid by the mid-2030s. 

“Innovation doesn't go in a straight line; it demands resilience and collaboration,” Twinney said. “We're grateful to all who stood with us. Together, we will energize the world.”

In-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant's hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.

Your next used car purchase could be a former rental car that you find on Amazon.

Hertz Car Sales is now selling its pre-owned vehicles on Amazon Autos, the marketplace launched by the tech giant last year, allowing shoppers to browse inventory and purchase a car online before picking it up at a Hertz location.

Seattle is among the initial locations for such a transaction, along with Dallas, Houston and Los Angeles, Hertz announced this week.

Hertz becomes the first such fleet dealer on the platform, which expands Amazon's inventory beyond its launch partnership with Hyundai dealerships. Hertz is offering pre-owned models from Nissan, Toyota, Chevrolet, Volvo and others. 

A search of the Hertz offerings on Amazon on Thursday showed approximately 100 vehicles within 75 miles of my location in Seattle. A 2024 Volkswagen Jetta, for instance, with 14,900 miles, is priced at $18,000. Hertz says vehicles are offered at competitive prices, often below Kelley Blue Book suggested retail value.

Known primarily as a rental car company, Hertz sells thousands of vehicles each year through its dozens of used car dealerships across the U.S. and Canada. The company plans to expand the Amazon offering to 45 locations nationwide.

Hertz, which went bankrupt during the pandemic, called the move a significant step in its broader transformation strategy, “which includes forging innovative technology partnerships to provide a more seamless customer experience.”

Vehicle shopping and purchases within the Amazon store come with some of the familiar features that Amazon shoppers are used to, such as customer reviews, seller (dealership) reviews, add to cart, and Amazon's familiar checkout process.

Seattle's Allen Institute will play a key role in a groundbreaking space mission this weekend. 

The Allen Institute for Cell Science is providing stem cells that will launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket late Saturday night. These stem cells are part of the first-ever effort to grow heart and brain organoids in space. 

The project is led by Cedars-Sinai investigators in Los Angeles, who hope to improve our understanding and treatment of diseases such as ALS, Parkinson's, and cardiovascular disease.

Organoids are tiny, 3D clusters of cells that mimic real organs. They help scientists to model disease and test treatment. On Earth, gravity limits how they develop. Researchers hope that space's microgravity environment means organoids will grow in new ways, potentially forming blood vessels or more complex structures.

The Allen Institute supplied the frozen stem cells that will make the cosmic journey. Once aboard the International Space Station (ISS), astronauts will nurture and document the samples inside a specialized “plate habitat,” created by BioServe Space Technologies in Colorado. After about a month in orbit, the organoids will return to Cedars-Sinai for analysis. 

RELATED: Allen Institute takes on a supporting role in experiment to grow stem cells in space

Founded by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, the Allen Institute is a non-profit research center whose key mission is to understand the fundamental principles of life and improve human health. The Institute is known for open-access biological data and large-scale research projects, and its contribution to the launch highlights Seattle's growing role in space-based biomedical science.

The experiment rides on NASA's 33rd SpaceX resupply flight to the ISS. It will be Cedars-Sinai's sixth space mission, following earlier efforts that introduced DNA into stem cells and produced stem cells in orbit.

The Falcon 9 is scheduled to launch at 11:45 pm Pacific Time on Aug. 23 from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla. There will be a livestream available on SpaceX and NASA channels. 

If successful, the work could pave the way to bioprinting tissues or even entire organs in space. “A dream of mine is to have a lab in space that is parallel with the labs that we have here on Earth,” said Arun Sharma, PhD, of Cedars-Sinai, in a statement.

Meta has frozen hiring in its AI organization after restructuring the unit earlier this week, reports The Wall Street Journal. The hiring freeze follows weeks of poaching more than 50 AI researchers and engineers from competitors.  

The freeze went into effect last week, and it's not clear how long it will last. Meta is still likely working through its reorg, which split its AI unit, Meta Superintelligence Labs, into four new groups: TBD Labs, run by former Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang, and three groups focused on research, product integration, and infrastructure, respectively. 

Meta confirmed the hiring freeze with The Journal, saying it was “basic organizational planning…after bringing people on board and undertaking yearly budgeting and planning exercises.”

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's push to get ahead in the AI race has sparked serious talent wars. He's personally called top researchers and engineers to offer them pay packages worth nine figures, and acquired either other startups or their leadership. Analysts have warned that the rise of stock-based compensation costs could threaten shareholder returns.

Nvidia is among a group of new investors to back Nuro — which develops self-driving software for delivery and ride-hailing services —  in a funding round that has reached $203 million.

The Silicon Valley startup announced Thursday that several investors, including existing backer Baillie Gifford, added another $97 million to its Series E round. New investors include Icehouse Ventures, Kindred Ventures, Nvidia, and Pledge Ventures. Uber, which last month said it would make a “multi-hundred-million dollar” investment in Nuro as part of a broader deal with the electric car maker Lucid, also participated. 

Nvidia's investment follows years of technical collaboration with Nuro. The startup uses Nvidia GPUs for its large-scale data processing and model training, and its latest compute model is built on the Nvidia Drive AGX Thor platform.

The first $106 million tranche of Series E funding was announced in April. Investment accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Fidelity Management & Research Company, Tiger Global Management, Greylock Partners, and XN participated in that first block. 

Nuro has raised $2.3 billion to date. Its Series E post-money valuation is $6 billion. That's a 30% drop from its $8.6 billion valuation in 2021 when Nuro raised $600 million in a Series D round. 

Much has changed in the past four years for Nuro and the broader autonomous vehicle industry. Like most startups in the nascent autonomous vehicle technology sector, Nuro was forced to examine its business model after economic conditions shut off the once-free-flowing tap of capital and ushered in a period of consolidation.

Nuro went through several rounds of layoffs in 2022 and 2023 before overhauling its business strategy. In 2024, Nuro scrapped plans to own and operate a fleet of low-speed, on-road delivery bots, and instead focused its efforts on licensing its technology to automakers and mobility providers, like ride-hail and delivery companies. 

The pivot has appeared to gain some traction — notably in July when Uber announced plans to launch a robotaxi service using all-electric Lucid Gravity SUVs equipped with Nuro's self-driving tech. Under the deal, Uber invested $300 million in Lucid and agreed to buy “at least” 20,000 of the EV maker's Gravity SUVs over the next six years. 

Uber also said it would invest an undisclosed “multi-hundred-million dollar” amount into Nuro. One source familiar with the agreement told TechCrunch the amount is more than Uber's investment in Lucid. 

A portion of Uber's investment has gone toward the Series E round. The remaining investment will be parceled out to Nuro as the company hits certain milestones. 

Nuro co-founder and president Dave Ferguson said in a statement that the company is well-positioned to continue its next phase of growth with the new capital. He added that the company, which employs about 700 people, will focus on delivering new commercial partnerships to realize autonomy at global scale.

Earlier this year, two hackers broke into a computer and soon realized the significance of what this machine was. As it turned out, they had landed on the computer of a hacker who allegedly works for the North Korean government. 

The two hackers decided to keep digging and found evidence that they say linked the hacker to cyberespionage operations carried out by North Korea, exploits and hacking tools, and infrastructure used in those operations. 

Saber, one of the hackers involved, told TechCrunch that they had access to the North Korean government worker's computer for around four months, but as soon as they understood what data they got access to, they realized they eventually had to leak it and expose what they had discovered.

“These nation-state hackers are hacking for all the wrong reasons. I hope more of them will get exposed; they deserve to be,” said Saber, who spoke to TechCrunch after he and cyb0rg published an article in the legendary hacking e-zine Phrack, disclosing details of their findings. 

There are countless cybersecurity companies and researchers who closely track anything the North Korean government and its many hacking groups are up to, which includes espionage operations, as well as increasingly large crypto heists and wide-ranging operations where North Koreans pose as remote IT workers to fund the regime's nuclear weapons program.

In this case, Saber and cyb0rg went one step further and actually hacked the hackers, an operation that can give more, or at least different, insights into how these government-backed groups work, as well as “what they are doing on a daily basis and so on,” as Saber put it. 

The hackers want to be known only by their handles, Saber and cyb0rg, because they may face retaliation from the North Korean government, and possibly others. Saber said that they consider themselves hacktivists, and he name-dropped legendary hacktivist Phineas Fisher, responsible for hacking spyware makers FinFisher and Hacking Team, as an inspiration. 

At the same time, the hackers also understand that what they did is illegal, but they thought it was nonetheless important to publicize it. 

“Keeping it for us wouldn't have been really helpful,” said Saber. “By leaking it all to the public, hopefully we can give researchers some more ways to detect them.”

“Hopefully this will also lead to many of their current victims being discovered and so to [the North Korean hackers] losing access,” he said.

“Illegal or not, this action has brought concrete artifacts to the community; this is more important,” said cyb0rg in a message sent through Saber.

Saber said they are convinced that while the hacker — who they call “Kim” — works for North Korea's regime, they may actually be Chinese and work for both governments, based on their findings that Kim did not work during holidays in China, suggesting that the hacker may be based there. 

Also, according to Saber, at times Kim translated some Korean documents into simplified Chinese using Google Translate. 

Saber said that he never tried to contact Kim. “I don't think he would even listen; all he does is empower his leaders, the same leaders who enslave his own people,” he said. “I'd probably tell him to use his knowledge in a way that helps people, not hurt them. But he lives in constant propaganda and likely since birth so this is all meaningless to him.” He's referring to the strict information vacuum that North Koreans live in, as they are largely cut off from the outside world.

Saber declined to disclose how he and cyb0rg got access to Kim's computer, given that the two believe they can use the same techniques to “obtain more access to some other of their systems the same way.” 

During their operation, Saber and cyb0rg found evidence of active hacks carried out by Kim, against South Korean and Taiwanese companies, which they say they contacted and alerted. 

North Korean hackers have a history of targeting people who work in the cybersecurity industry as well. That's why Saber said he is aware of that risk, but “not really worried.” 

“Not much can be done about this, definitely being more careful though :),” said Saber.

It's the most transparent estimate yet from one of the big AI companies, and a long-awaited peek behind the curtain for researchers.

Google has just released a technical report detailing how much energy its Gemini apps use for each query. In total, the median prompt—one that falls in the middle of the range of energy demand—consumes 0.24 watt-hours of electricity, the equivalent of running a standard microwave for about one second. The company also provided average estimates for the water consumption and carbon emissions associated with a text prompt to Gemini.

It's the most transparent estimate yet from a Big Tech company with a popular AI product, and the report includes detailed information about how the company calculated its final estimate. As AI has become more widely adopted, there's been a growing effort to understand its energy use. But public efforts attempting to directly measure the energy used by AI have been hampered by a lack of full access to the operations of a major tech company. 

Earlier this year, MIT Technology Review published a comprehensive series on AI and energy, at which time none of the major AI companies would reveal their per-prompt energy usage. Google's new publication, at last, allows for a peek behind the curtain that researchers and analysts have long hoped for.

The study focuses on a broad look at energy demand, including not only the power used by the AI chips that run models but also by all the other infrastructure needed to support that hardware. 

“We wanted to be quite comprehensive in all the things we included,” said Jeff Dean, Google's chief scientist, in an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review about the new report.

That's significant, because in this measurement, the AI chips—in this case, Google's custom TPUs, the company's proprietary equivalent of GPUs—account for just 58% of the total electricity demand of 0.24 watt-hours. 

Another large portion of the energy is used by equipment needed to support AI-specific hardware: The host machine's CPU and memory account for another 25% of the total energy used. There's also backup equipment needed in case something fails—these idle machines account for 10% of the total. The final 8% is from overhead associated with running a data center, including cooling and power conversion. 

This sort of report shows the value of industry input to energy and AI research, says Mosharaf Chowdhury, a professor at the University of Michigan and one of the heads of the ML.Energy leaderboard, which tracks energy consumption of AI models. 

Estimates like Google's are generally something that only companies can produce, because they run at a larger scale than researchers are able to and have access to behind-the-scenes information. “I think this will be a keystone piece in the AI energy field,” says Jae-Won Chung, a PhD candidate at the University of Michigan and another leader of the ML.Energy effort. “It's the most comprehensive analysis so far.”

Google's figure, however, is not representative of all queries submitted to Gemini: The company handles a huge variety of requests, and this estimate is calculated from a median energy demand, one that falls in the middle of the range of possible queries.

Here's how MIT Technology Review waded through a mess of data and hidden variables to calculate the individual and collective energy demand from AI.

So some Gemini prompts use much more energy than this: Dean gives the example of feeding dozens of books into Gemini and asking it to produce a detailed synopsis of their content. “That's the kind of thing that will probably take more energy than the median prompt,” Dean says. Using a reasoning model could also have a higher associated energy demand because these models take more steps before producing an answer.

This report was also strictly limited to text prompts, so it doesn't represent what's needed to generate an image or a video. (Other analyses, including one in MIT Technology Review's Power Hungry series earlier this year, show that these tasks can require much more energy.)

The report also finds that the total energy used to field a Gemini query has fallen dramatically over time. The median Gemini prompt used 33 times more energy in May 2024 than it did in May 2025, according to Google. The company points to advancements in its models and other software optimizations for the improvements.  

Google also estimates the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the median prompt, which they put at 0.03 grams of carbon dioxide. To get to this number, the company multiplied the total energy used to respond to a prompt by the average emissions per unit of electricity.

Rather than using an emissions estimate based on the US grid average, or the average of the grids where Google operates, the company instead uses a market-based estimate, which takes into account electricity purchases that the company makes from clean energy projects. The company has signed agreements to buy over 22 gigawatts of power from sources including solar, wind, geothermal, and advanced nuclear projects since 2010. Because of those purchases, Google's emissions per unit of electricity on paper are roughly one-third of those on the average grid where it operates.

AI data centers also consume water for cooling, and Google estimates that each prompt consumes 0.26 milliliters of water, or about five drops. 

The goal of this work was to provide users a window into the energy use of their interactions with AI, Dean says. 

“People are using [AI tools] for all kinds of things, and they shouldn't have major concerns about the energy usage or the water usage of Gemini models, because in our actual measurements, what we were able to show was that it's actually equivalent to things you do without even thinking about it on a daily basis,” he says, “like watching a few seconds of TV or consuming five drops of water.”

The publication greatly expands what's known about AI's resource usage. It follows recent increasing pressure on companies to release more information about the energy toll of the technology. “I'm really happy that they put this out,” says Sasha Luccioni, an AI and climate researcher at Hugging Face. “People want to know what the cost is.”

This estimate and the supporting report contain more public information than has been available before, and it's helpful to get more information about AI use in real life, at scale, by a major company, Luccioni adds. However, there are still details that the company isn't sharing in this report. One major question mark is the total number of queries that Gemini gets each day, which would allow estimates of the AI tool's total energy demand. 

And ultimately, it's still the company deciding what details to share, and when and how. “We've been trying to push for a standardized AI energy score,” Luccioni says, a standard for AI similar to the Energy Star rating for appliances. “This is not a replacement or proxy for standardized comparisons.”

Plastic production is a massive source of greenhouse-gas emissions.

I remember using a princess toothbrush when I was little. The handle was purple, teal, and sparkly. Like most of the other pieces of plastic that have ever been made, it's probably still out there somewhere, languishing in a landfill. (I just hope it's not in the ocean.)

I've been thinking about that toothbrush again this week after UN talks about a plastic treaty broke down on Friday. Nations had gotten together to try and write a binding treaty to address plastic waste, but negotiators left without a deal.

Plastic is widely recognized as a huge source of environmental pollution—again, I'm wondering where that toothbrush is—but the material is also a contributor to climate change. Let's dig into why talks fell apart and how we might address emissions from plastic.

I've defended plastic before in this newsletter (sort of). It's a wildly useful material, integral in everything from glasses lenses to IV bags.

But the pace at which we're producing and using plastic is absolutely bonkers. Plastic production has increased at an average rate of 9% every year since 1950. Production hit 460 million metric tons in 2019. And an estimated 52 million metric tons are dumped into the environment or burned each year.

Plastic is cheap to make and shockingly profitable. It's everywhere. And we're all paying the price.

So, in March 2022, the UN Environment Assembly set out to develop an international treaty to address plastic pollution. Pretty much everyone should agree that a bunch of plastic waste floating in the ocean is a bad thing. But as we've learned over the past few years, as these talks developed, opinions diverge on what to do about it and how any interventions should happen.

One phrase that's become quite contentious is the “full life cycle” of plastic. Basically, some groups are hoping to go beyond efforts to address just the end of the plastic life cycle (collecting and recycling it) by pushing for limits on plastic production. There was even talk at the Assembly of a ban on single-use plastic.

Petroleum-producing nations strongly opposed production limits in the talks. Representatives from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait told the Guardian that they considered limits to plastic production outside the scope of talks. The US reportedly also slowed down talks and proposed to strike a treaty article that references the full life cycle of plastics.

Petrostates have a vested interest because oil, natural gas, and coal are all burned for energy used to make plastic, and they're also used as raw materials. This stat surprised me: 12% of global oil demand and over 8% of natural gas demand is for plastic production.  

That translates into a lot of greenhouse gas emissions. One report from Lawrence Berkeley National Lab found that plastics production accounted for 2.24 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2019—that's roughly 5% of the global total.  

And looking into the future, emissions from plastics are only set to grow. Another estimate, from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, projects that emissions from plastics could swell from about 2 billion metric tons to 4 billion metric tons by 2060.

This chart is what really strikes me and makes the conclusion of the plastic treaty talks such a disappointment.

Recycling is a great tool, and new methods could make it possible to recycle more plastics and make it easier to do so. (I'm particularly interested in efforts to recycle a mix of plastics, cutting down on the slow and costly sorting process.)

But just addressing plastic at its end of life won't be enough to address the climate impacts of the material. Most emissions from plastic come from making it. So we need new ways to make plastic, using different ingredients and fuels to take oil and gas out of the equation. And we need to be smarter about the volume of plastic we produce.  

One positive note here: The plastic treaty isn't dead, just on hold for the moment. Officials say that there's going to be an effort to revive the talks.

Less than 10% of plastic that's ever been produced has been recycled. Whether it's a water bottle, a polyester shirt you wore a few times, or a princess toothbrush from when you were a kid, it's still out there somewhere in a landfill or in the environment. Maybe you already knew that. But also consider this: The greenhouse gases emitted to make the plastic are still in the atmosphere, too, contributing to climate change.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","On the ground in Ukraine's largest Starlink repair shop","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/21/1122035/ukraines-largest-starlink-repair-shop/","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Elon Musk's satellite internet service has been absolutely critical to the country's defense. But staying connected through war relies on innovation and rehab work from “The People's Starlink.”

Oleh Kovalskyy thinks that Starlink terminals are built as if someone assembled them with their feet. Or perhaps with their hands behind their back. 

To demonstrate this last image, Kovalskyy—a large, 47-year-old Ukrainian, clad in sweatpants and with tattoos stretching from his wrists up to his neck—leans over to wiggle his fingers in the air behind him, laughing as he does. Components often detach, he says through bleached-white teeth, and they're sensitive to dust and moisture. “It's terrible quality. Very terrible.” 

But even if he's not particularly impressed by the production quality, he won't dispute how important the satellite internet service has been to his country's defense. 

Starlink is absolutely critical to Ukraine's ability to continue in the fight against Russia: It's how troops in battle zones stay connected with faraway HQs; it's how many of the drones essential to Ukraine's survival hit their targets; it's even how soldiers stay in touch with spouses and children back home. 

At the time of my visit to Kovalskyy in March 2025, however, it had begun to seem like this vital support system may suddenly disappear. Reuters had just broken news that suggested Musk, who was then still deeply enmeshed in Trump world, would remove Ukraine's access to the service should its government fail to toe the line in US-led peace negotiations. Musk denied the allegations shortly afterward, but given Trump's fickle foreign policy and inconsistent support of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, the uncertainty of the technology's future had become—and remains—impossible to ignore.  

Kovalskyy's unofficial Starlink repair shop may be the biggest of its kind in the world. Ordered chaos is the best way to describe it.

The stakes couldn't be higher: Another Reuters report in late July revealed that Musk had ordered the restriction of Starlink in parts of Ukraine during a critical counteroffensive back in 2022. “Ukrainian troops suddenly faced a communications blackout,” the story explains. “Soldiers panicked, drones surveilling Russian forces went dark, and long-range artillery units, reliant on Starlink to aim their fire, struggled to hit targets.”

None of this is lost on Kovalskyy—and for now Starlink access largely comes down to the unofficial community of users and engineers of which Kovalskyy is just one part: Narodnyi Starlink.

The group, whose name translates to “The People's Starlink,” was created back in March 2022 by a tech-savvy veteran of the previous battles against Russia-backed militias in Ukraine's east. It started as a Facebook group for the country's infant yet burgeoning community of Starlink users—a forum to share guidance and swap tips—but it very quickly emerged as a major support system for the new war effort. Today, it has grown to almost 20,000 members, including the unofficial expert “Dr. Starlink”—famous for his creative ways of customizing the systems—and other volunteer engineers like Kovalskyy and his men. It's a prime example of the many informal, yet highly effective, volunteer networks that have kept Ukraine in the fight, both on and off the front line.

Kovalskyy and his crew of eight volunteers have repaired or customized more than 15,000 terminals since the war began in February 2022. Here, they test repaired units in a nearby parking lot.

Kovalskyy gave MIT Technology Review exclusive access to his unofficial Starlink repair workshop in the city of Lviv, about 300 miles west of Kyiv. Ordered chaos is the best way to describe it: Spread across a few small rooms in a nondescript two-story building behind a tile shop, sagging cardboard boxes filled with mud-splattered Starlink casings form alleyways among the rubble of spare parts. Like flying buttresses, green circuit boards seem to prop up the walls, and coils of cable sprout from every crevice.

Those acquainted with the workshop refer to it as the biggest of its kind in Ukraine—and, by extension, maybe the world. Official and unofficial estimates suggest that anywhere from 42,000 to 160,000 Starlink terminals operate in the country. Kovalskyy says he and his crew of eight volunteers have repaired or customized more than 15,000 terminals since the war began.

Despite the pressure, the chance that they may lose access to Starlink was not worrying volunteers like Kovalskyy at the time of my visit; in our conversations, it was clear they had more pressing concerns than the whims of a foreign tech mogul. Russia continues to launch frequent aerial bombardments of Ukrainian cities, sometimes sending more than 500 drones in a single night. The threat of involuntary mobilization to the front line looms on every street corner. How can one plan for a hypothetical future crisis when crisis defines every minute of one's day?

Almost every inch of every axis of the battlefield in Ukraine is enabled by Starlink. It connects pilots near the trenches with reconnaissance drones soaring kilometers above them. It relays the video feeds from those drones to command centers in rear positions. And it even connects soldiers, via encrypted messaging services, with their family and friends living far from the front.  

Although some soldiers and volunteers, including members of Narodnyi Starlink, refer to Starlink as a luxury, the reality is that it's an essential utility; without it, Ukrainian forces would need to rely on other, often less effective means of communication. These include wired-line networks, mobile internet, and older geostationary satellite technology—all of which provide connectivity that is either slower, more vulnerable to interference, or more difficult for untrained soldiers to set up. 

“If not for Starlink, we would already be counting rubles in Kyiv,” Kovalskyy says.

The workshop's crew has learned to perform adjustments to terminals, especially in adapting them for battlefield conditions. At right, a volunteer engineer shows the fragments of shrapnel he has extracted from the terminals.

Despite being designed primarily for commercial use, Starlink provides a fantastic battlefield solution. The low-latency, high-bandwidth connection its terminals establish with its constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites can transmit large streams of data while remaining very difficult for the enemy to jam—in part because the satellites, unlike geostationary ones, are in constant motion. 

It's also fairly easy to use, so that soldiers with little or no technical knowledge can connect in minutes. And the system costs much less than other military technology; while the US and Polish governments pay business rates for many of Ukraine's Starlink systems, individual soldiers or military units can purchase the hardware at the private rate of about $500, and subscribe for just $50 per month.

No alternatives match Starlink for cost, ease of use, or coverage—and none will in the near future. Its constellation of 8,000 satellites dwarfs that of its main competitor, a service called OneWeb sold by the French satellite operator Eutelsat, which has only 630 satellites. OneWeb's hardware costs about 20 times more, and a subscription can run significantly higher, since OneWeb targets business customers. Amazon's Project Kuiper, the most likely future competitor, started putting satellites in space only this year. 

Volodymyr Stepanets, a 51-year-old Ukrainian self-described “geek,” had been living in Krakow, Poland, with his family when Russia invaded in 2022. But before that, he had volunteered for several years on the front lines of the war against Russian-supported paramilitaries that began in 2014. 

He recalls, in those early months in eastern Ukraine, witnessing troops coordinating an air strike with rulers and a calculator; the whole process took them between 30 and 40 minutes. “All these calculations can be done in one minute,” he says he told them. “All we need is a very stupid computer and very easy software.” (The Ukrainian military declined to comment on this issue.)

Stepanets subsequently committed to helping this brigade, the 72nd, integrate modern technology into its operations. He says that within one year, he had taught them how to use modern communication platforms, positioning devices, and older satellite communication systems that predate Starlink. 

So after Russian tanks rolled across the border, Stepanets was quick to see how Starlink's service could provide an advantage to Ukraine's armed forces. He also recognized that these units, as well as civilian users, would need support in utilizing the new technology. And that's how he came up with the idea for Narodnyi Starlink, an open Facebook group he launched on March 21, just a few weeks after the full invasion began and the Ukrainian government requested the activation of Starlink.

Over the past few years, the Narodnyi Starlink digital community has grown to include volunteer engineers, resellers, and military service members interested in the satellite comms service. The group's members post roughly three times per day, often sharing or asking for advice about adaptations, or seeking volunteers to fix broken equipment. A user called Igor Semenyak recently asked, for example, whether anyone knew how to mask his system from infrared cameras. “How do you protect yourself from heat radiation?” he wrote, to which someone suggested throwing special heat-proof fabric over the terminal.

Its most famous member is probably a man widely considered the brains of the group: Oleg Kutkov, a 36-year-old software engineer otherwise known to some members as “Dr. Starlink.” Kutkov had been privately studying Starlink technology from his home in Kyiv since 2021, having purchased a system to tinker with when service was still unavailable in the country; he believes that he may have been the country's first Starlink user. Like Stepanets, he saw the immense potential for Starlink after Russia broke traditional communication lines ahead of its attack.

“Our infrastructure was very vulnerable because we did not have a lot of air defense,” says Kutkov, who still works full time as an engineer at the US networking company Ubiquiti's R&D center in Kyiv. “Starlink quickly became a crucial part of our survival.”

Stepanets contacted Kutkov after coming across his popular Twitter feed and blog, which had been attracting a lot of attention as early Starlink users sought help. Kutkov still publishes the results of his own research there—experiments he performs in his spare time, sometimes staying up until 3 a.m. to complete them. In May, for example, he published a blog post explaining how users can physically move a user account from one terminal to another when the printed circuit board in one is “so severely damaged that repair is impossible or impractical.” 

“Oleg Kutkov is the coolest engineer I've met in my entire life,” Kovalskyy says.

When the fighting is at its worst, the workshop may receive 500 terminals to repair every month. The crew lives and sometimes even sleeps there.

Supported by Kutkov's technical expertise and Stepanets's organizational prowess, Kovalskyy's warehouse became the major repair hub (though other volunteers also make repairs elsewhere). Over time, Kovalskyy—who co-owned a regional internet service provider before the war—and his crew have learned to perform adjustments to Starlink terminals, especially to adapt them for battlefield conditions. For example, they modified them to receive charge at the right voltage directly from vehicles, years before Starlink released a proprietary car adapter. They've also switched out Starlink's proprietary SPX plugs—which Kovalskyy criticized as vulnerable to moisture and temperature changes—with standard ethernet ports. 

Together, the three civilians—Kutkov, Stepanets, and Kovalskyy—effectively lead Narodnyi Starlink. Along with several other members who wished to remain anonymous, they hold meetings every Monday over Zoom to discuss their activities, including recent Starlink-related developments on the battlefield, as well as information security. 

While the public group served as a suitable means of disseminating information in the early stages of the war when speed was critical, they have had to move a lot of their communications to private channels after discovering Russian surveillance; Stepanets says that at least as early as 2024, Russians had translated a 300-page educational document they had produced and shared online. Now, as administrators of the Facebook group, the three men block the publication of any posts deemed to reveal information that might be useful to Russian forces. 

Stepanets believes the threat extends beyond the group's intel to its members' physical safety. When we talked, he brought up the attempted assassination of the Ukrainian activist and volunteer Serhii Sternenko in May this year. Although Sternenko was unaffiliated with Narodnyi Starlink, the event served as a clear reminder of the risks even civilian volunteers undertake in wartime Ukraine. “The Russian FSB and other [security] services still understand the importance of participation in initiatives like [Narodnyi Starlink],” Stepanets says. He stresses that the group is not an organization with a centralized chain of command, but a community that would continue operating if any of its members were no longer able to perform their roles. 

The informal, accessible nature of this community has been critical to its success. Operating outside official structures has allowed Narodnyi Starlink to function much more efficiently than state channels. Yuri Krylach, a military communications officer who was inspired by Kovalskyy to set up his own repair workshop as part of Ukraine's armed forces, says that official processes can be slower than private ones by a factor of 10; his own team's work is often interrupted by other tasks that commanders deem more urgent, whereas members of the Narodnyi Starlink community can respond to requests quickly and directly. (The military declined to comment on this issue, or on any military connections with Narodnyi Starlink.)

Most of the Narodnyi Starlink members I spoke to, including active-duty soldiers, were unconcerned about the report that Musk might withdraw access to the service in Ukraine. They pointed out that doing so would involve terminating state contracts, including those with the US Department of Defense and Poland's Ministry of Digitalization. Losing contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars (the Polish government claims to pay $50 million per year in subscription fees), on top of the private subscriptions, would cost the company a significant amount of revenue. “I don't really think that Musk would cut this money supply,” Kutkov says. “It would be quite stupid.” Oleksandr Dolynyak, an officer in the 103rd Separate Territorial Defense Brigade and a Narodnyi Starlink member since 2022, says: “As long as it is profitable for him, Starlink will work for us.”

Stepanets does believe, however, that Musk's threats exposed an overreliance on the technology that few had properly considered. “Starlink has really become one of the powerful tools of defense of Ukraine,” he wrote in a March Facebook post entitled “Irreversible Starlink hegemony,” accompanied by an image of the evil Darth Sidious from Star Wars. “Now, the issue of the country's dependence on the decisions of certain eccentric individuals … has reached [a] melting point.”

Since Russia's invasion, Serhii “Flash” Beskrestnov has become an influential, if sometimes controversial, force—sharing expert advice and intel on the ever-evolving technology that's taken over the skies. His work may determine the future of Ukraine, and wars far beyond it.

Even if telecommunications experts both inside and outside the military agree that Starlink has no direct substitute, Stepanets believes that Ukraine needs to diversify its portfolio of satellite communication tools anyway, integrating additional high-speed satellite communication services like OneWeb. This would relieve some of the pressure caused by Musk's erratic, unpredictable personality and, he believes, give Ukraine some sense of control over its wartime communications. (SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.) 

The Ukrainian military seems to agree with this notion. In late March, at a closed-door event in Kyiv, the country's then-deputy minister of defense Kateryna Chernohorenko announced the formation of a special Space Policy Directorate “to consolidate internal and external capabilities to advance Ukraine's military space sector.” The announcement referred to the creation of a domestic “satellite constellation,” which suggests that reliance on foreign services like Starlink had been a catalyst. “Ukraine needs to transition from the role of consumer to that of a full-fledged player in the space sector,” a government blog post stated. (Chernohorenko did not respond to a request for comment.)

Ukraine isn't alone in this quandary. Recent discussions about a potential Starlink deal with the Italian government, for example, have stalled as a result of Musk's behavior. And as Juliana Süss, an associate fellow at the UK's Royal United Services Institute, points out, Taiwan chose SpaceX's competitor Eutelsat when it sought a satellite communications partner in 2023.

“I think we always knew that SpaceX is not always the most reliable partner,” says Süss, who also hosts RUSI's War in Space podcast, citing Musk's controversial comments about the country's status. “The Taiwan problems are a good example for how the rest of the world might be feeling about this.”

Nevertheless, Ukraine is about to become even more deeply enmeshed with Starlink; the country's leading mobile operator Kyivstar announced in July that Ukraine will soon become the first European nation to offer Starlink direct-to-mobile services. Süss is cautious about placing too much emphasis on this development though. “This step does increase dependency,” she says. “But that dependency is already there.” Adding an additional channel of communications as a possible backup is otherwise a logical action for a country at war, she says.

These issues can feel far away for the many Ukrainians who are just trying to make it through to the next day. Despite its location in the far west of Ukraine, Lviv, home to Kovalskyy's shop, is still frequently hit by Russian kamikaze drones, and local military-affiliated sites are popular targets. 

Still, during our time together, Kovalskyy was far more worried by the prospect of his team's possible mobilization. In March, the Ministry of Defense had removed the special status that had otherwise protected his people from involuntary conscription given the nature of their volunteer activities. They're now at risk of being essentially picked up off the street by Ukraine's dreaded military recruitment teams, known as the TCK, whenever they leave the house.

This is true even though there's so much demand for the workshop's services that during my visit, Kovalskyy expressed frustration at the vast amount of time they've had to dedicate solely to basic repairs. “We have extremely professional engineers who are extremely intelligent,” he told me. “Repairing Starlink terminals for them is like shooting ducks with HIMARS [a vehicle-borne GPS-guided rocket launcher].” 

At least the situation seemed to have become better on the front over the winter, Kovalskyy added, handing me a Starlink antenna whose flat, white surface had been ripped open by shrapnel. When the fighting is at its worst, the team might receive 500 terminals to repair every month, and the crew lives in the workshop, sometimes even sleeping there. But at that moment in time, it was receiving only a couple of hundred.

We ended our morning at the workshop by browsing its vast collection of varied military patches, pinned to the wall on large pieces of Velcro. Each had been given as a gift by a different unit as thanks for the services of Kovalskyy and his team, an indication of the diversity and size of Ukraine's military: almost 1 million soldiers protecting a 600-mile front line. At the same time, it's a physical reminder that they almost all rely on a single technology with just a few production factories located on another continent nearly 6,000 miles away.

“We sometimes perform miracles with Starlinks,” Kovalskyy says. 

He and his crew can only hope that they will still be able to for the foreseeable future—or, better yet, that they won't need to at all.

Apple just reintroduced a blood-oxygen reading feature to some Apple Watches last week, but a new lawsuit could force the company to turn it off again.

The health tech company Masimo sued U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Wednesday over an agency decision that allowed Apple to restore the feature. Masimo had previously sued Apple, claiming that the company had infringed on its patents.

The timing of the lawsuit comes as Apple has been pushing deeper into medical devices, while also cozying up to the Trump Administration in what some have speculated is an effort to secure favorable tariff policies.

Masimo says CBP unlawfully allowed Apple to reactivate blood-oxygen tracking on its Watches, even though the feature allegedly rips off Masimo's tech.

In a lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court, the medical-device maker argued CBP overstepped its authority with an August 1 ruling that reversed its own January decision.

“It has now come to light that CBP thereafter reversed itself without any meaningful justification, without any material change in circumstances, and without any notice to Masimo, let alone an opportunity for Masimo to be heard,” the complaint reads.

Masimo says it only learned about the reversal when Apple announced on August 14 that it was bringing the feature back, “enabled by a recent U.S. Customs ruling.” This time, though, the Blood Oxygen app will offload the sensor data to the paired iPhone for processing instead of crunching the numbers on the Watch itself.

Masimo is now seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to block CBP's decision and reinstate the original ruling, which had required Apple to fully disable the feature before selling its Watches in the U.S.

The ban on the watch feature has been in place since October 2023, when the U.S. International Trade Commission found Apple was infringing two Masimo patents. Apple kept selling Watches with the hardware intact, but turned off the feature with a software update. Its appeal of the ITC ban is still pending.

The lawsuit also points to the timing of Apple's big domestic investment pledges. After announcing more than $500 billion in U.S. investments earlier this year, Apple unveiled another $100 billion outlay during the August 6 Oval Office meeting with President Donald Trump.

The new lawsuit also comes as Apple has increasingly been rolling out health features on its devices.

Last year, Apple added a scientifically validated hearing test and a clinical-grade hearing aid mode to its AirPods Pro 2, letting them make “personalized dynamic adjustments” to amplify sounds in real time. The company has also rolled out a new sleep apnea feature for its Watches—an algorithm that can detect signs of moderate to severe sleep apnea by analyzing breathing disturbances.

The reigning king of controversy has just found himself saddled with one more expensive problem.

A U.S. District Court judge in Texas has ordered Elon Musk to continue a lawsuit filed by voters who gave up personal information in exchange for winning a $1 million daily cash prize from Musk's PAC, Reuters reports.

The case says the contest constitutes a form of illegal lottery or sweepstakes, which is prohibited under federal and state law, and misled people into sharing personal information through a fraudulent campaign.

Arizona resident Jacqueline McAferty is a defendant in the case and alleges that Musk and the PAC promised voters across seven key swing states a $1 million prize, and that those voters were then required to share their phone numbers, email addresses, physical addresses and names.

Musk's legal defense says that petition signers did not suffer tangible harm from providing personal details.

Musk created America PAC during the 2024 election cycle, saying he wanted it to help support the U.S. Constitution, Reuters reports. He says those $1 million payments were incentives for voters to “earn” money and become spokespeople for the PAC.

Judge Robert Pitman in Austin disagreed with that position and ruled this week that the allegations by McAferty are plausible enough to take the case to trial. Pittman pointed to conflicting statements about whether any money was “awarded” and that voters could “win” the money through a sweepstakes-like plan.

In October 2024, a Philadelphia judge refused to end Musk's giveaway, saying that city's top prosecutor failed to show it was an illegal lottery. At the time, defendant Larry Krasner's attorney John Summers brought up a Musk tweet on X that dubbed Judge Angelo Foglietta a “leftist judge,” shamed Musk for not attending the hearing, and called him “cowardly and irresponsible.”

Musk's broader controversial engagement in political campaigns and his high-ranking role in the second Trump administration has made him a lightning rod for criticism.

The case also highlights how the use of social media and digital platforms in political fundraising and public outreach actually work and whether or not they are safe for consumers, the Washington Post reports. That opaque approach could mean little accountability and the use of potentially deceptive tactics to influence public opinion during key electoral moments.

Lawyers for America PAC and Musk did respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit was filed on Election Day, Nov. 5, 2024.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wants to buy planes for Immigration and Customs Enforcement that would be dedicated to deporting as many migrants as possible, according to a new report from NBC News. And it seems extremely likely that she'll get them, given the fact that recent legislation allocated billions in new funding for ICE.

Historically, ICE has used planes owned by private companies for deportation flights, chartering 8-14 planes at a time during President Joe Biden's time in office, according to NBC News. Biden was deporting about 15,000 immigrants per month, less than half of the Trump regime's rough goal.

The Trump regime deported somewhere between 100,000 to 150,000 people in the first six months of Trump's new term, but that seems to include people who “self-deported,” according to NBC News. It's difficult to get accurate figures, and ICE didn't respond to questions emailed on Wednesday. News of the possibility that Noem could procure planes for ICE comes as Wired has revealed phone searches at the U.S. border by CBP have soared to a record high.

The so-called Big Beautiful Bill was signed into law last month and includes $170 billion for immigration enforcement, including an additional $75 billion just for ICE. That money is allowing ICE to open up new detention facilities and hire new officers, many of whom are terrorizing communities across the U.S. right now. That also will hypothetically allow ICE to buy planes, which could cost anywhere from $80 million to $400 million each, depending on which airliners the agency chooses.

If ICE chooses to buy its own planes, the agency will be responsible for maintaining them, which will add additional costs. But Noem probably isn't too worried about that, now that Republicans have given her what CBS News dubbed an “unprecedented level of funding.” The new ICE budget rivals the budgets of major militaries around the world.

Chartering planes was already expensive for ICE, at a cost of roughly $25,000 per hour, according to NBC, which covers the cost of things like pilots, flight attendants, security, and medical staff. But it will theoretically be even more expensive if ICE chooses to buy its own dedicated planes.

In another era, it was considered highly unusual for domestic law enforcement agencies to own their own planes. In fact, it was a major scandal when the FBI bought its first planes in the 1970s. The FBI bought two Lockheed YO-3As in 1974, which had been used as spy planes during the Vietnam War. And people were outraged, insisting the FBI didn't need its own air force.

But we are well past an era when overreach by law enforcement was something that might get major pushback in the U.S. We live in a country that's been taken over by literal fascists, and they are going to remake the nation in their image. The guardrails are gone, and sadistic punishment from far-right ideologues is the order of the day.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:tomshardware.com","South Korea says there are no plans for the U.S. to acquire Samsung shares — denial comes amid talks about Washington acquiring a 10% equity stake in Intel for CHIPS Act funds","https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/south-korea-says-there-are-no-plans-for-the-u-s-to-acquire-samsung-shares-denial-comes-amid-talks-about-washington-acquiring-a-10-percent-equity-stake-in-intel-for-chips-act-funds","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 13:20:42 GMT","

South Korea's political and business scenes are being shaken up by the thought of a U.S. stake in Samsung.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


South Korea's presidential office has denied that the U.S. government is looking to purchase Samsung stocks, with the Blue House saying that these are unfounded rumors. According to Digitimes, the speculation started after U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed in a live interview that the White House is in talks with Intel to get a 10% stake in the company in exchange for the billions it received in CHIPS Act funding. There were also reports that Lutnick wanted to expand that deal to other CHIPS Act recipients, which include Samsung.

The South Korean conglomerate was set to receive more than $6 billion in CHIPS Act funding, which was designed to support the construction and expansion of its Taylor, Texas, fab. Although this is a much smaller amount than what Intel received, in both absolute terms and in relation to its market capitalization of more than $300 billion, the fact that there's even talk of a foreign government taking a stake in South Korea's crown jewel will stir trouble within its political and business realms.

A few experts suggest that the U.S. acquiring shares in Samsung would be beneficial for all involved, as it would make it easier for the company to access the U.S. market and might even help it avoid import taxes. It could even serve as a bridge between the two governments easing the tension brought about by the 25% tariff that President Donald Trump has put on its goods entering U.S. shores.

Still, the Blue House's initial reaction from this news shows how protective it is of this conglomerate. Some estimates suggest that the company's revenue makes up around 20% of South Korea's GDP. So, despite the numerous domestic political scandals the company has been involved in in recent years, its government still wants to ensure that it remains an independent Korean company with no foreign influence, even if it's coming from its own ally.

There will be a long and arduous negotiation if ever the U.S. pushes through with this idea and asks for equity in exchange for the money it has granted the company. All the parties involved would have to agree on what partial U.S. ownership would look like. Would it include seats on the board, or a say in how the company is run? Or would the U.S. simply let the company run and take any dividends it can get from its investment? And what would happen when the administration — in South Korea and the U.S. — changes its mind and wants to be more involved?

This isn't the first time that a national government has had a stake in a semiconductor company. For example, TSMC is also partially owned by Taiwan and the Singapore wealth fund. However, these are questions that must be answered before Samsung and South Korea will even agree to any deal.

Jiushark's JF15K features double-wide towers and fans that provide airflow over RAM DIMMs, but it doesn't deliver a significant advantage over traditional air coolers.

Innovative design looks like no other air cooler

Good performance with AMD CPUs

Louder than most air coolers

Doesn't perform as well on Intel systems


Why you can trust Tom's Hardware




Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.


While Jiushark isn't a well-known brand in U.S. enthusiast and PC building circles, we've covered the company in the past, highlighting some of its unique products like the Jiushark M.2 Three SSD cooler the JF800 dual-tower air cooler, which performed extremely well.

Next up from the company is another unique product, the JF15K, an air cooler that's very different than traditional designs. It features heatsinks almost twice as wide as traditional coolers, with a length of 179mm, and is cooled by four 100 mm fans instead of one or two larger fans.



Will Jiushark's latest make our list of best CPU coolers on the market? Let's look at its features and our test results first. But even if you love the JF15K, it's not available in the U.S. You'll have to import it from Asia through a site like Taobao if you want one for your PC!

Included in the box are the following:

▶ Double-wide dual-tower air cooler

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.



This cooler is unlike any other on the market, incorporating two double-wide heatsinks to dissipate heat.



▶ It isn't as big as it looks!



It might appear to be similar in size to a 240mm AIO, but it's not quite that long. Most 240mm liquid coolers have a length of approximately 277 mm, while the Jiushark's JF15K is “only” 179 mm long.



▶ Six copper heatpipes

The cooler uses six copper heatpipes to move heat away from the CPU into the fins of the heatsinks. Its CPU coldplate, however, looks like it might benefit from being a bit beefier.



▶ ARGB lighting strips

The tops of the cooler incorporate large ARGB light strips to help it stand out even in the dark. For those who don't like illumination, a non-ARGB version of this cooler is also available – or you could just leave the ARGB cable disconnected.



▶ Four fans – yes, four



Because the JF15K incorporates two double-wide heatsinks, it follows that it would use four fans. But these aren't your typical 120 or 140 mm fans, they're a bit smaller than normal. Jiushark lists these fans as being 100 mm, but they appear to be 90mm based on the 179mm width of the heatsinks.

The unique design of this air cooler has two fans above RAM slots, providing airflow, which may be useful to those looking to overclock their memory for the fastest performance possible.

1. You'll first need to apply the included backplate if you're using an Intel CPU. AMD users will remove the default mounting mechanism.

2. Next, you'll need to install the standoffs.



3. Take the mounting bars and apply them to the standoffs, then secure them with the included screws.



4. Apply the included thermal paste to your CPU. If you have any questions on how to do this properly, please refer to our handy how to apply thermal paste guide.

5. Remove the middle fans from the cooler, then set the coldplate against the CPU and secure it with a screwdriver.



6. Reinsert the middle fans.



7. Finally, connect the PWM and ARGB cables to the corresponding motherboard headers and you're done.



My testing emphasizes results that are comparable to real-world use. This means I test CPU coolers inside a closed desktop case, which increases cooling difficulty compared to other testing methods. Many will test CPU coolers outside of a case, on an open test bench. Open benches have lowered ambient temperatures, which in turn makes weak coolers appear stronger than they actually are. And some publications have used generic thermal plates to test cooling solutions.

I reject both of these methods because they don't accurately reflect the real-world conditions where a CPU cooler is used.

There are many factors other than the CPU cooler that can influence your cooling performance, including the case you use and the fans installed in it. A system's motherboard can also influence this, especially if it suffers from bending, which results in poor cooler contact with the CPU.

In order to prevent socket bending from impacting our cooling results, we've installed Thermalright's LGA 1700 contact frame into our testing rig. If your motherboard is affected by bending, your thermal results will be worse than those shown below. Not all motherboards are affected equally by this issue. I tested Raptor Lake CPUs in two motherboards. And while one of them showed significant thermal improvements after installing Thermalright's LGA1700 contact frame, the other motherboard showed no difference in temperatures whatsoever! Check out our review of the contact frame for more information.

We've recently added testing of AMD's flagship sixteen-core Ryzen 9 9950X3D. This is one beast of a CPU, providing the best gaming and multithreaded performance on the market – it can also prove quite challenging thermally when PBO is enabled for overclocking.

Advanced shader delivery will cut initial game loading time by as much as 85%.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Microsoft has announced a new feature that will reduce initial load times called advanced shader delivery. According to the DirectX Developer Blog, this will move shader compilation from the device to the cloud, allowing you to download the necessary files directly to your device for caching. Aside from allowing you to get into your game much faster, with the company reporting an observed 85% reduction in loading times for Avowed, it also claims to save your battery and processing power, as Microsoft handles the heavy lifting on its end.



Shader compilation is traditionally done on-device, as it must be compiled specifically for your game, GPU, and driver version. This means that shader compilation performance will vary based on your software and hardware — and with the nearly infinite number of variations out there, it was next to impossible for developers to pre-compile shaders for every device. However, Microsoft changed this by creating a new standard format called State Object Database (SODB).

The company collects the shader data from the game and packages it into an SODB. The DirectX developers then worked with GPU manufacturers to separate the shader compiler from the graphics driver, allowing the team to merge it with the SODB and create a Precompiled Shader Database (PSDB). When you download a game through the Xbox PC App, it will detect your system configuration and include the proper PSDB for your system. So, when you launch a game for the first time, it will detect the pre-loaded shaders and skip the lengthy compilation process.

It allegedly also works even if you update your driver or even upgrade your GPU, as the Xbox PC app should be able to notice any changes to your device and download the necessary PSDB for your game. But, in case your system is unique, and Microsoft doesn't have a PSDB for it yet (say, you're running beta drivers), your computer is still capable of compiling shaders on its own.

This feature will be first available on the Asus ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X, set to launch on October 16, but Microsoft hints that it will have wider availability in the future. It also doesn't require additional work from game developers at the moment, meaning all the compilation work is done on Xbox's servers. Still, the company says that it plans to collaborate with the wider gaming industry to integrate advanced shader delivery directly into game engines, saving gamers from long loading times, but also making us more dependent on Xbox's online services.

The cause of the incident could be intentional or accidental

Something weird happened with the Great Firewall of China (GFW), which the Chinese government uses to control internet access within the country, on August 20.

A site dedicated to monitoring China's internet censorship systems called GFW Report claimed the Great Firewall ""exhibited anomalous behavior by unconditionally injecting forged TCP RST+ACK packets to disrupt all connections on TCP port 443"" for approximately 74 minutes before resuming its normal processes. (Or ""normal,"" I guess.)

A quick aside: TCP port 443 is typically used for HTTPS — the more Secure version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol that makes it more difficult for someone to spy on or tamper with the connection between devices — but the port and protocol aren't inextricably linked. Systems can be configured to manage HTTPS via different ports.

The behavior reported by GFW Report differs from China's previous efforts to censor encrypted communications in that it specifically targeted port 443, with the report saying ""the unconditional RST+ACK injections was on TCP port 443, but not on other common ports like 22, 80, 8443."" (Often used for SSH, HTTP, and as an alternative for HTTPS, respectively.)

Contrast that with this from GFW Report in August 2020 detailing the GFW's efforts to block ""one of the foundational features of TLS 1.3 and HTTPS."" In that case, the Chinese government was specifically targeting the TLS 1.3 and HTTPS protocols across every port (1-65535) rather than limiting its disruptions to a single port.

That alone isn't necessarily unusual. ""The [GFW] is not a single entity but a complex system composed of various network devices that perform censorship,"" GFW Report said, and it doesn't rely on a single method of disrupting traffic. Bypassing the GFW isn't a problem that only needs to be solved once; it's an ongoing concern.

The bigger mystery is whether or not the behavior seen on August 20 was intended.

""The responsible device does not match the fingerprints of any known GFW devices,"" GFW Report said, ""suggesting that the incident was caused by either a new GFW device or a known device operating in a novel or misconfigured state."" But the group's investigation into this blip was hindered by its short duration.

Studying the GFW is vital because of its humanitarian impact, of course, but it's also fairly unique in that the Chinese government is effectively trying to have its cake and eat it too. Blocking connections to the rest of the world would be economically devastating, so China can't pull a North Korea by cutting off access to the broader internet. But it doesn't want to provide unfettered access to information, either.

In a sense it would be easier to copy other authoritarian regimes in simply cutting off internet access—at least temporarily—in times of crisis. (See: Turkey, Kazakhstan, Sudan, Egypt, etc.) Instead the GFW is a weird compromise between open internet access and no internet access.

Ahead of Apple, it seems.

This week, Google introduced its Pixel 10 smartphone running its G5 application processor. The new smartphone offers higher performance, bigger batteries with faster charging, magnetic wireless charging, and seven years of software support. However, the most interesting part of the announcement is that Google switched the contract manufacturer of the processor from Samsung to TSMC. From that, what's perhaps more noteworthy is that Google allegedly switched to TSMC ahead of Apple, TSMC's alpha customer.

Both Pixel 9 and Pixel 10 handsets maintain a nearly identical look to their predecessors, with new finishes in Moonstone, Obsidian, Porcelain, and Jade. The flagship Pixel 10 Pro features a 6.3-inch LTPO OLED at a 1280×2856 resolution, while the beyond-flagship XL grows to 6.8 inches at 1344×2992.

The Tensor G5 is the central change in the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL. It is the first Pixel processor manufactured by TSMC, moving away from Samsung's fabrication, which historically lagged in efficiency. This switch is expected to bring both higher performance and better power management.

In terms of raw numbers, Google says the CPU inside the Tensor G5 delivers a 34% speed increase compared to the Tensor G4. For AI-driven tasks, the improvements are even more substantial, with a 60% boost in performance. However, it's worth noting that this claim comes from Google, and there's no information provided about the data formats used.

It appears the chip uses TSMC's N3P (a performance-enhanced 3nm-class process technology) fabrication process, the most advanced foundry technology that currently exists. The motivation for Google's move may be that TSMC has consistently delivered stronger yields and more refined transistor designs at 3nm-class, enabling higher performance at lower power.

TSMC's N3P manufacturing process is an optical shrink of the N3E platform, offering tangible gains in performance, efficiency, and density while retaining full design compatibility, which is not the case for Google's IP.

In terms of performance, N3P provides about a 5% boost in speed at the same power levels, or alternatively a 5–10% reduction in energy use when maintaining the same clock rates. This balance gives designers a lot of flexibility in terms of either pushing for higher performance or optimizing for longer battery life and reduced thermal output, depending on product goals, which was perhaps Google's goal. The chip designer has likely achieved success, as the G5 powering the Pixel 10 is now in mass production.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 5% of the world's adult population lives with depression — a mental health condition that can have a profound impact on a person's overall health. 

Past research shows that people can help lower their risk for depression by following healthy lifestyle guidelines, such as getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and following a healthy diet. 

Certain foods have also been linked to decreased depression risk, such as fatty fish, leafy greens, berries, and foods rich in probiotics like yogurt and sauerkraut. 

“Mental health disorders, including depression, impose a major global burden, and current treatments — such as pharmacotherapy — often have limitations and side effects,” Minkook Son, MD, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Physiology in the College of Medicine at Dong-A University in the Republic of Korea, told Medical News Today

“Diet is a modifiable factor that can be targeted for prevention and adjunctive treatment. Understanding how specific dietary components influence mental health could provide low-risk, widely accessible strategies to reduce disease burden and improve overall well-being,” explained Son.

He is the corresponding author of a new study recently published in the journal Nutrients that has identified specific minerals — including potassium and zinc — that may also help in reducing a person's depression risk. 

For this study, researchers conducted a cross-sectional analysis using health data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in Korea (KNHANES) and the United States (NHANES), encompassing more than 22,000 study participants. 

Scientists focused specifically on seven minerals — sodium, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, zinc, and calcium — to examine their impact on depression risk. 

“These seven minerals are consistently measured in both the KNHANES and the NHANES, enabling a standardized cross-national analysis,” Son explained. “They are also biologically relevant to brain function, neurotransmission, and neuroinflammation, processes implicated in the pathophysiology of depression.”

Upon analysis, researchers found that both participants from South Korea and the U.S. who had higher levels of potassium had the lowest risk for depression. 

“Potassium emerged as a common protective factor against depression in both populations, despite differences in dietary habits,” Son said.

“This consistent association suggests potassium intake may play a fundamental role in mental health, supporting public health strategies to encourage potassium-rich diets as part of depression prevention efforts.”

– Minkook Son, MD, PhD

In addition to potassium, when examining just Korean participants, researchers discovered that higher sodium levels were correlated to a reduced depression risk. Among U.S. participants, higher levels of zinc was another mineral linked to lower odds of developing depression. 

“Cultural dietary patterns, primary food sources of each mineral, and differences in bioavailability likely contribute to these discrepancies,” Son explained. “For instance, in Korea, sodium intake is high due to fermented and broth-based dishes, potentially interacting with other nutrients to influence mood.” 

“In the U.S., zinc intake from animal protein sources may play a more prominent role in neurochemical pathways relevant to depression,” he continued. “These variations underscore the importance of considering population-specific nutritional contexts when evaluating mental health risk factors.”

“Because our study is cross-sectional, it cannot establish causality,” Son added. “Future work will include longitudinal cohort studies and intervention trials to clarify causal relationships, as well as mechanistic research to understand how mineral intake influences depression risk at the biological level.”

MNT had the opportunity to speak with Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, about this study, in which she was not involved.

Richard commented she was not surprised by the results. “Potassium balances cellular fluid levels, assists in muscle contraction, and transmits nerve signals in the brain,” she told us.

“Minerals such as potassium, magnesium, and selenium work with vitamins like D, C, and E to support functions throughout the body, as well as numerous enzymatic reactions, and act as electrolytes to support fluid balance. We thrive when we have sufficient levels of all these working together in the highly complex factory of the human body,” Richard detailed.

The dietitian also pointed out that potassium is often an underconsumed nutrient in the American diet, correlating with deficient intake of daily fruit and vegetable servings. 

“Recommendations range from 2,600–3,400 mg [milligrams] or more a day, depending on gender, health conditions, activity level, and hydration. Keep in mind it is not about one nutrient, but a combination of how they all work together to support physical and mental health. If a variety of potassium and nutrient-rich foods are incorporated throughout the day it can be fairly simple to meet daily recommended needs.” 

– Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN

Richard gave this example as a high potassium daily menu: 

Richard also suggested focusing on what fruits and vegetables are currently in season and trying to incorporate varied produce and items throughout the day of these additional foods naturally rich in potassium:

Even though diet is not the only important factor when it comes to mental health, the recent study adds to the evidence that opting for healthy foods can help regulate mood.

“Across continents and age groups, mineral depleted diets raise red flags for depression — and a bevy of other health concerns — so hydrating and mineral-rich foods aren't just healthy, they might be healing,” said Richard. 

Accoeding to her: “Potassium helps keep your heart happy and brain healthy. Together, that's a recipe for mood stabilization.”

Healthy older adults who received aspirin experienced no significant long-term benefits against major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE); the rates of major hemorrhage were higher among users of aspirin than among users of placebo.

“Other research suggests that certain subgroups might benefit from aspirin for primary prevention. However, established bleeding risks and also the possible absence of long-term MACE benefit need to be considered in clinical decision-making,” the researchers reported.

This study was led by Rory Wolfe, PhD, of Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. It was published online on August 12, 2025, in the European Heart Journal.

The researchers could only ascertain the use of aspirin at the annual visits, which prevented precise tracking of changes between visits. The post-trial comparison was not randomized, which may have influenced the assessment of risks.

This study received grants from the National Institute on Aging and National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health in the USA, the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, Monash University, and the Victorian Cancer Agency. Aspirin and placebo were provided by Bayer AG. Several authors reported receiving research support or honoraria and having other financial ties with various sources, including Bayer.

A 2-year telephone-based intervention providing nurse-led support calls and short message service (SMS) to mothers was associated with a reduced BMI in children aged up to 5 years, with the greatest benefit seen in those from lower-income families.

“Our study demonstrates the potential for telehealth in a preventive framework to improve obesity risk outcomes of preschool-aged children, particularly low-income children,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Li Ming Wen, Population Health Research & Evaluation Hub, Sydney Local Health District, Camperdown, Australia. It was published online in the International Journal of Obesity.

The generalizability of the findings was limited by the study location and participant demographics. Due to the COVID pandemic, the trial intervention and data collection were conducted pragmatically rather than ideally, which may have affected outcomes. Additionally, secondary outcomes were limited by mothers' self-reporting.

This study was funded by a National Health and Medical Research Council Partnership grant. The authors declared having no competing interests.

Adults from low-income populations who used a smartphone application that delivered tailored, real-time content quit smoking at much higher rates after about 6 months than those who received standard digital support; they also used the application more frequently and found it more helpful.

“These findings suggest that the Smart-T intervention shows promise as a low-cost, accessible tool for smoking cessation among adults with low SES [socioeconomic status] and may help overcome barriers limiting traditional cessation programs,” the authors of the study wrote. “Given the ubiquity of smartphones, interventions like Smart-T could play a key role in reducing smoking-related health disparities and improving public health,” they added.

This study was led by Emily T. Hébert, DrPH, of the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences in Oklahoma City. It was published online on August 14, 2025, in JAMA Network Open.

Participants were required to set a quit date exactly 7 days after enrollment, limiting generalizability to those less prepared to quit smoking. Smart-T was only available on Android devices during the trial. Recruitment through digital platforms and a cessation program may have limited participation from individuals with lower digital literacy or those not actively seeking to quit.

This study received support from the NCI and used resources partially funded by NCI. Additional funding came from the Oklahoma Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust and the Oklahoma Shared Clinical and Translational Resources through an Institutional Development Award from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. One author reported receiving royalties from the Insight Mobile Health Platform (used for data management in this study) and personal fees from Qnovia. Two other authors reported owning patents with royalties paid from the Insight Platform, while another author reported having a patent application for a device to verify recent smoking status.

Lisocabtagene maraleucel demonstrated superior efficacy, with a median event-free survival of 29.5 months compared to 2.4 months for standard of care in second-line large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). The 36-month overall survival rate reached 63% for lisocabtagene maraleucel vs 52% for standard care, with progression-free survival rates of 51% vs 26.5%, respectively.

“These results provide long-term evidence to support liso-cel [lisocabtagene maraleucel] as an effective second-line treatment with curative potential for patients with primary refractory/early relapsed LBCL,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Manali Kamdar, MD, MBBS, University of Colorado Cancer Center in Aurora, Colorado. It was published online in Journal of Clinical Oncology.

When interpreting overall survival data, the crossover design of the study needs to be considered. Additionally, the study was not powered to evaluate statistical differences in overall survival between treatment arms due to limited number of events in both groups.

In 2023, Spain recorded 320,656 births, of which 21,322 were premature, according to the National Statistics Institute. That figure represents 6.6% of all births, meaning that 1 in every 15 newborns is premature and requires specialized care, with nutrition playing a critical role.

Human milk banks (HMBs) have become the cornerstone of neonatal care in Spain. The first facility opened in 2001 in Palma de Mallorca, followed by a second in 2007 at the 12 de Octubre University Hospital in Madrid, Spain.

The network has since expanded to 22 centers across Spain, operating within blood and tissue banks, neonatology departments, and personalized nutrition units.

A 2023 report from the Spanish Association of Human Milk Banks reported record growth in Spain, with several key measures, including the highest number of donors to date. A total of 2657 donors were accepted, the highest number since the establishment of the HMB network.

Catalonia registered 737 donors, followed by Madrid with 335 donors and the Valencian Community in Spain with 224 donors.

In total, 13,745 liters of milk were donated, with 11,781 liters pasteurized and 9949 liters distributed to hospitals, providing nutritional support for 4290 infants in 83 centers in Spain.

The activities of HMBs in Spain have shown continuous and sustained growth since 2009. The number of accepted donors increased from 175 in 2009 to 2657 in 2023, reflecting a progressive increase in public awareness and participation in this type of altruistic donation.

The volume of donated milk has also increased from 1144 liters in 2009 to 13,745 liters in 2023.

The volume of milk distributed grew more than 10-fold over this period, rising from 774 liters in 2009 to 9949 liters, reflecting the expansion of HMBs' processing and distribution capacity.

Consequently, the number of infant recipients grew from 333 in 2009 to 4290 in 2023. This increase underscores the vital and expanding clinical role of donor human milk, particularly in premature infants and those with specific medical needs.

For premature infants or those with medical conditions, the World Health Organization, United Nations Children's Fund, Spanish Society of Neonatology, and Spanish Association of Pediatrics recommend donor human milk when the mother's milk is unavailable. 

Donor human milk provides protection against serious or potentially fatal illnesses and supports healthy growth and development.

“Human milk is now regarded as a true medicine,” said Carmen Pallás-Alonso, MD, PhD, head of Neonatology at Hospital 12 de Octubre University Hospital, and the director of the milk bank. Scientific evidence has shown that it reduces the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, infection, and digestive disorders. Its benefits extend over the long term, supporting neurodevelopment and lowering cardiovascular risk in adulthood, including its positive effects on blood pressure and lipid profiles.

Donors are healthy lactating women who breastfeed their own children and altruistically choose to donate excess milk to help sick or premature infants. Selection involves a personal interview to assess health and lifestyle, as well as serologic testing for HIV, syphilis, human T-lymphotropic virus, hepatitis B and C, and Chagas disease.

Although donation can begin at any stage of lactation, it is recommended to wait 3-8 weeks postpartum to ensure that breastfeeding is well-established.

At HMBs, milk donated by selected mothers is received, processed, analyzed, stored, and distributed to hospitals to feed newborns who cannot receive their mothers' milk. The collected milk undergoes rigorous safety and quality control.

First, microbiological analysis detects any contamination, followed by macronutrient testing, including energy, fat, protein, and lactose, allowing healthcare professionals to match the nutritional content of milk to the requirements of each infant.

Milk is then pasteurized using the Holder method (62.5 °C for 30 minutes) to eliminate pathogens, before being cooled, frozen, and stored until distribution.

Although uncommon in Spain, commercial online markets for human milk exist in countries such as the US and Canada.

The Spanish Association of Pediatrics warns that this practice carries serious health risks because donor screening and processing cannot be verified.

A study published in Pediatrics found that approximately 11% of human milk samples purchased online were contaminated with cow's milk.

Laboratory analysis indicated that, in most cases, the level of contamination was sufficiently high to suggest deliberate adulteration rather than accidental exposure.

Associations such as the Spanish Association of Human Milk Banks, established in 2008 in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, and the European Milk Bank Association (EMBA), founded in Milan, Italy, in 2010, have been key to promoting safe and effective HMB operations through standardized protocols.

These organizations foster international collaboration and help establish standardized protocols to ensure the quality, traceability, and safety of donated milk.

The online market for human donor milk has expanded. This practice presents documented health risks because it operates without standard controls for donor screening, handling milk, or storage. These risks highlight the importance of stringent regulatory standards for milk distribution.

The EMBA's Consensus Statement outlines over 100 evidence-based recommendations for milk banking, from donor selection to distribution, highlighting the importance of rigorous oversight of donor selection, heat treatment, storage, and distribution.

These protocols not only safeguard vulnerable newborns but also preserve the beneficial properties of breast milk under controlled conditions, reinforcing its role as a therapeutic tool in hospitals.

Breast milk is essential for newborns; however, recent studies have suggested that it may also help detect breast cancer in mothers months before routine diagnosis.

In 2024, the Maimonides Institute of Biomedical Research of Córdoba (IMIBIC) in Córdoba, Spain, launched the Hera Project, led by Juan de la Haba-Rodríguez, MD, a medical oncologist and researcher at IMIBIC and Reina Sofía University Hospital, and Silvia Guil-Luna, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher affiliated with IMIBIC, Reina Sofía Hospital, and the University of Córdoba in Córdoba, Spain.

The study identified postpartum breast cancer cases using biomarkers in breast milk. The results were presented at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago.

Researchers at the Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology, part of the Vall d'Hebron Campus in Barcelona, Spain, have found that breast milk from patients diagnosed with breast cancer during pregnancy or postpartum contains circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). This ctDNA can be detected through liquid biopsy of breast milk and could become a new tool for the early diagnosis of breast cancer in the postpartum period.

The results of this study were published in Cancer Discovery, which reported the first detection of cell-free tumor DNA in breast milk from patients with breast cancer.

Using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction, researchers detected tumor variants in 87% of breast milk samples, whereas 92% of matched blood plasma samples showed no variants.

This indicated that breast milk may be a more effective medium for tumor DNA analysis.

Next-generation sequencing confirmed these results, showing 71.4% sensitivity and 100% specificity. In two cases, tumor DNA was detected in breast milk collected 18 and 6 months before routine clinical diagnosis, highlighting its potential for earlier breast cancer detection.

Emerging insights into the gut-lung axis continue to open new possibilities for managing chronic respiratory diseases, from cystic fibrosis (CF) in the youngest patients to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in older adults. Despite growing evidence linking gut health to respiratory disease pathogenesis, these findings are not yet ready for routine clinical application. Still, they underscore the value of discussing diet and nutrition with patients as part of broader strategies to optimize overall health.

“For most lung diseases, the majority of the literature on gut health that changes lung disease pathogenesis is from research studies,” explained Rachel Scheraga, MD, pulmonologist and critical care physician at Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland. Although studies have explored gut metabolites and lung microbiome changes associated with gut dysbiosis, they cannot yet lead to evidence-based dietary interventions for patients without further clinical trials in humans.

But there are some practical gut-lung connections that currently impact practice. For instance, when gut dysfunction is suspected, pulmonologists at Cleveland Clinic refer patients to gastroenterology to rule out other contributing conditions such as reflux. This is an especially important step for patients with end-stage lung disease awaiting transplant, given the link between poor gut health and an increased risk for transplant rejection.

“The main gap is for the pulmonologist to determine what context the gut may be contributing to either the acute or chronic disease and the proper time to screen for gut dysfunction,” Scheraga said. “I believe it is important to start with translational research to determine the cause and effect of the contribution of gut dysfunction to lung disease. Once it is determined what specifically the gut is doing to cause lung disease progression, then clinical research can be performed to modify this factor and see if the lung disease improves.”

At the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth in Hanover, New Hampshire, George A. O'Toole, PhD, is exploring the association between the gut microbiome and CF.

“Linking the gut to the lung is a complex process that requires a team of researchers in the clinic and at the bench,” he shared. “Bench scientists need to understand the clinical issues, and clinicians can help translate observations from patient care into laboratory studies to better define these connections. This area of research must be collaborative — and pulmonologists play a key role.”

While many studies have documented associations between gut dysbiosis and chronic lung disease, the mechanisms remain poorly defined. O'Toole points to several key questions:

O'Toole's work in CF in pediatric populations has validated links between gut pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infections in infants and children. This work has been done in close collaboration with Juliette Madan, MD, MS, and Julie Sanville, DO, physician-scientists at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire.

“In our CF model, we established the link between gut and airway, and we know this link is driven by propionate,” he said. “I'm excited to understand how propionate tunes the airway response. We are also developing probiotic strategies that I think could have great potential.”

“Understanding this connection lets us develop new means to help address airway disease. We have the opportunity to improve patient outcomes.”

As diet and nutritional status are recognized as modulators of lung health through the gut-lung axis, personalized nutrition has the potential to be as complementary to pharmacologic therapy, said Inês Brandão, PhD, Head of Research at Centro de Apoio Tecnológico Agro Alimentar, Castelo Branco, Portugal, a Portugal-based research and innovation center focused on the agri-food sector.

Adequate protein intake, anti-inflammatory, fiber-rich diets, and the use of probiotics, prebiotics, or symbiotics can help support asthma, COPD, and other respiratory diseases, she said, adding the need for well-designed clinical trials, validated biomarkers, and multidisciplinary care teams.

“Encouraging patients to adopt anti-inflammatory, fiber-rich diets and consider probiotic or prebiotic supplementation may support gut microbiota health and reduce lung inflammation,” she said. “This represents, beyond any doubt, low-risk and cost-effective strategies.”

“Moving forward,” Brandão said, “building a shared understanding through collaboration between researchers, clinicians, and nutrition experts will be essential to provide clear, practical guidance for pulmonologists.”

Brandão, O'Toole, and Scheraga reported having no relevant financial relationships.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended the combination of enfortumab vedotin (Padcev, Astellas) with pembrolizumab (Keytruda, MSD) as a first-line option for adults with unresectable or metastatic urothelial cancer who are eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy.

More than 1200 people in England are expected to benefit each year. Clinical experts described the combination therapy as a ""step change"" in bladder cancer management. Until now, treatment options for this patient group have seen little meaningful progress since the 1980s.

Enfortumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate consisting of an antibody targeting nectin-4, a protein highly expressed in urothelial carcinoma cells. After binding, it causes the cells to release monomethyl auristatin E, resulting in cell death. Pembrolizumab, its combination partner, is a PD-1 inhibitor. 

Urothelial cancer accounts for around 90% of bladder cancers, affecting more than 18,000 people annually in England. Prognosis is poor, with only 10% of patients with stage 4 disease surviving for 5 years or more. 

Current standard treatments include platinum-based chemotherapy ( cisplatin or carboplatin with gemcitabine) followed by avelumab maintenance therapy if the cancer has not progressed. However, only about 12% of patients see improvement with chemotherapy, underscoring the need for better options.

Patient experts described living with metastatic urothelial cancer as ""intensely challenging and emotionally exhausting,” affecting work, travel, and physical activity. Action Bladder Cancer UK called the announcement a “very welcome, and significant, step forward for this hard-to-treat cancer.”

The recommendation in final draft guidance was supported by results from the phase 3 EV-302 trial, which enrolled 886 adults with untreated, unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic urothelial cancer. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either enfortumab vedotin-pembrolizumab or standard chemotherapy.

Enfortumab vedotin-pembrolizumab nearly doubled the median time to disease progression or death to 12.5 months, compared with 6.3 months for chemotherapy. Median overall survival was also improved, at 33.8 months vs 15.9 months with chemotherapy. 

Helen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at NICE, said the drug combination is “highly promising and effective,” adding that these clinical trial results highlight the “tremendous difference” it could make to the length and quality of people's lives.

Enfortumab vedotin is listed at £578 per 20 mg vial or £867 per 30 mg vial. Pembrolizumab costs £2630 per 100 mg vial, excluding VAT.

The drugs will be supplied through confidential commercial arrangements with the NHS. NICE's appraisal committee applied a severity modifier, reflecting the high disease burden, and concluded that the therapy met acceptable cost-effectiveness thresholds.

The treatment will be available immediately across the NHS in England, with funding required within 90 days of final publication of the guidance.

A novel cancer vaccine that stimulates T-cell activity in KRAS-driven pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) has shown promise in early testing.

The investigational vaccine, ELI-002, developed by Elicio Therapeutics, is designed to train the immune system to recognize and attack tumor cells harboring mutant KRAS, which is present in roughly 93% of PDAC and 50% of CRC.

While only in phase 1 testing, the vaccine elicited strong T-cell responses in more than 80% of patients with minimal residual mutant KRAS disease following standard locoregional treatment. This strong response correlated with longer recurrence-free and overall survival, the investigators, led by Zev Wainberg, MD, with University of California, Los Angeles, reported online earlier this month in Nature Medicine.

It's “extremely promising to have a vaccine that seems to stimulate T-cell activity in KRAS-driven tumors,” Magnus Dillon, PhD, clinician scientist at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, England, said in a statement from the UK nonprofit Science Media Center. “These are generally ‘immune cold,' so therapies which stimulate immune responses in this group of patients are much needed.”

But Dillon and other experts not involved in the research cautioned that the data are preliminary, the study was not powered for efficacy, and no firm conclusions about clinical value can be drawn.

While there is “some interesting science in this study,” said Richard Sullivan, PhD, director, Institute of Cancer Policy, King's College London, London, England, “this is a long way from proving any sort of clinical utility.”

“We've been here before with this sort of approach and not have it translate into tangible efficacy,” Sullivan added.

In the phase 1 AMPLIFY-201 study, 20 patients with PDAC and five with CRC who had minimal residual disease following surgery and chemotherapy received the peptide-based ELI-002 vaccine. Doses included 0.1 mg, 0.5 mg, 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg. The researchers identified a T-cell response threshold — a 9.17-fold increase over baseline — that best differentiated patients with better (n = 17, 68%) and worse (n = 8, 32%) outcomes.

Overall, 21 of 25 patients (84%) developed mutant KRAS-specific T-cell responses, including all six patients treated at the two highest doses as well as responses in both CD4+ and CD8+ in 71% of patients. The induction of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells significantly correlated with overall tumor biomarker response.

Tumor biomarker responses occurred in 21 patients (84%), with complete clearance in six (three PDAC and three CRC), as determined by tumor-informed ctDNA analysis.

With follow-up extended to a median of 19.7 months, median relapse-free survival was 16.3 months and overall survival was 28.9 months.

Median overall survival was not reached in above the threshold responders vs 15.98 months in those below (hazard ratio [HR], 0.23; P = .0099). Median radiographic relapse-free survival was also not reached in above the threshold responders vs 3.02 months in those below (HR, 0.12; P = .0002).

Overall, 11 of 17 patients with T-cell response above the threshold remained free from radiographic progression, whereas all eight patients below the threshold had radiographic progression, seven of whom died.

In addition, in 67% of patients, the immune system expanded its attack to other tumor-specific antigens not included in the vaccine, potentially broadening protection.

No dose-limiting toxicities or severe treatment-related side effects were reported.

Elicio Therapeutics is now testing a 7-peptide formulation of ELI-002 (ELI-002 7P) in 135 patients with mutant KRAS-driven PDAC, with interim data on disease-free survival expected later this year.

The findings are promising but preliminary.

“Many patients have these KRAS mutations, so an off-the-shelf vaccine could benefit lots of people — it saves the cost and time required to make a personalized vaccine,” Dillon commented.

“However, it's a bit early to definitively tell whether this will work to prevent cancer relapse in this group of patients who have had all disease removed at surgery — larger studies will be needed,” Dillon said.

Sullivan noted that “all this paper really says is that the vaccine generates polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell immunity to mutant KRAS.”

Khurum Khan, MBBS, consultant medical oncologist, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, England, agreed that, while the immune and clinical signals observed in this phase 1 study are “promising and hypothesis-generating” and “the scientific data presented are robust,” the findings do not yet establish efficacy.

“We cannot assume these findings will translate to benefit in larger phase 2 or phase 3 trials,” Khan said.

This study was sponsored and funded by Elicio Therapeutics. Wainberg reported receiving consultant/advisory fees from Alligator Bioscience, Bayer, Lilly Oncology, AstraZeneca, Merck, Merck KGaA, Daiichi Sankyo, MacroGenics, Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Astellas, Ipsen, Arcus, Novartis, PureTech, Roche, Seagen, and Pfizer, and reported receiving research funding (institutional) from Elicio Therapeutics, Five Prime Therapeutics, Arcus, Pfizer, Plexxikon, Novartis, and Merck.

DISCLOSURES August 21, 2025  

A 67-year-old man with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% presents to his primary care provider for a routine physical examination. His vital signs and blood pressure are normal, but he has an irregular pulse.

The correct diagnosis is sinus rhythm, PVCs, and echo beats (Figure 2).

The rhythm is irregular with a repeating grouped beating pattern, with three QRS complexes and a pause. Therefore, the rhythm is regularly irregular. The average rate is 42 beats/min. 

The first of three QRS complexes has a normal duration (0.08 sec) and morphology. The axis is physiologically leftward between 0° and -30° (positive QRS complex in leads I and II and negative in lead aVF). This QRS complex is preceded by a P wave (+), which is positive in leads I, II, aVF, and V4-V6. The PR interval is constant (0.16 sec). Therefore, this is a sinus complex. The QT/QTc intervals are normal (420/350 msec). 

The second QRS complex (^) is wide (0.14 sec), and it has an unusual morphology not typical for either a left or right bundle branch block. There is positive concordance from V1-V5, although there is an S wave in V6. This QRS complex is not preceded by a P wave. Therefore, this is a PVC. 

The third QRS complex is identical to the first and is therefore supraventricular. This QRS complex is preceded by a P wave (*) that is negative in leads II and aVF, and positive in aVR. Therefore, this is not a sinus P wave. Because it is negative in lead aVF, it originates from either the atrioventricular (AV) node (ie, retrograde) or the low part of the atrium. There is a fixed relationship between the PVC and the negative P wave, so it is likely a retrograde P wave resulting from ventriculoatrial (VA) conduction from the PVC. The supraventricular complex that follows the PVC is therefore termed an echo complex. 

An echo complex occurs with a preceding QRS complex that is not preceded by a P wave (junctional, ventricular, or paced complex) and is associated with intact VA conduction. Intact VA conduction may lead to retrograde activation of the atrium (retrograde P wave). Given the right timing, this retrograde atrial impulse can then enter the AV node and His-Purkinje system to restimulate the ventricles in an antegrade direction (ie, it echoes back to the ventricles).

Philip Podrid, MD, is an electrophysiologist, a professor of medicine and pharmacology at Boston University School of Medicine, and a lecturer in medicine at Harvard Medical School. Although retired from clinical practice, he continues to teach clinical cardiology and especially ECGs to medical students, house staff, and cardiology fellows at many major teaching hospitals in Massachusetts. In his limited free time, he enjoys photography, music, and reading. ","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Higher leukocyte counts, predominantly within the normal range, independently predicted new-onset diabetes in individuals with HIV infection, potentially identifying an increased risk for diabetes up to 10 years before diagnosis.

“Knowledge that high leukocytes, mostly within the normal range, increase DM [diabetes] risk 10 years in advance and by more than twice in 20% of people with HIV (ie, those in the top leukocyte quintile) may motivate clinicians to place even more emphasis on the optimization of DM risk factors (weight, nutrition, physical activity) and, perhaps, ART [antiretroviral therapy] selection in such persons,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Sophia C. Meyer and Zoe Klein, University Center for Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases Service, Kantonsspital Baselland, Bruderholz, Switzerland. It was published online on August 01, 2025, in HIV Medicine.

The study population predominantly consisted of men, White individuals, and relatively young individuals, potentially limiting generalizability. Nutrition, differential leukocyte counts, inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and interleukin 6 are not routinely measured in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, nor is A1c, which may have led to the underestimation of diabetes cases in the present study.

This study was funded by the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, the Swiss HIV Cohort Study Research Foundation, and the Swiss National Science Foundation.

The way cardiovascular care is delivered in the US is changing rapidly. Procedures once limited to hospitals are now increasingly performed in outpatient clinics such as ambulatory surgery centers and office-based laboratories (OBLs). In 2022, 65% of outpatient peripheral vascular interventions in Medicare beneficiaries were performed in OBLs. The volume of procedures done in ASCs is projected to rise by 21% by 2034, according to a recent analysis published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

“Cardiovascular procedures that were traditionally thought of as only being able to be performed in the hospital setting are increasingly performed in a safer manner such that their conduct in facilities outside of hospitals is not only possible but being encouraged in many ways,” said Robert Yeh, MD, a cardiologist at Harvard Medical School, Boston.

For the study, Yeh and his colleagues examined the regulatory and financial drivers behind the shift in procedural geography.

They found that much of the growth in outpatient clinics has been driven by financial consideration. Federal policy and payer incentives have fueled much of the move toward outpatient cardiovascular care. Starting in the mid-2000s, Medicare expanded the list of procedures reimbursed in ambulatory settings, including device implantation and peripheral vascular interventions. In 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services also began covering coronary stenting in ASCs, projecting $20 million in savings if just 5% of cases shifted out of hospitals.

Third-party payers often follow Medicare's lead, Yeh said, “so there's an incentive to promote that care.”

Physicians themselves also have an incentive to perform procedures in outpatient clinics. ASCs and OBLs are often physician-owned and so provide a way to reclaim some financial autonomy at a time when physician-owned practices are in decline and hospital employment is becoming more common. Private equity groups and even hospitals themselves are increasingly investing as partners in outpatient clinics, seeing them as a growing revenue stream, Yeh said.

The shift to outpatient clinics has clear benefits for patients as well.

“Patients' journey through healthcare has never been easy. Many hate having to go to the hospital, dealing with parking and a big, confusing building,” said Mustafa Husaini, MD, chair of the American College of Cardiology Cardiovascular Management Council.

They much prefer having procedures done at ASCs and OBLs, which are faster, more efficient, and often closer to home, he said. And OBLs in particular can enhance access to care for underserved communities, said Yeh, with those undergoing peripheral vascular intervention in OBLs more likely to be Black individuals and of lower socio-economic status than those treated in hospitals.

“If we can increase access to high-end procedures that's an inherent good,” Yeh said. “There's an opportunity to meet patients where they are.”

While advances in technology have made cardiovascular procedures safer outside the hospital, gaps remain in ensuring consistent standards of care. Few data exist on complication rates and adverse events in ASCs and OBLs, or on what the outcome of those complications are — whether they are dealt with at the clinic or require hospital support, for example.

“In the hospital-based world we have a robust network of quality registries which ensure a very high level of care and help identify where gaps exist,” Yeh said. “In the ASC or OBL setting we don't have that same rigorous data collection system to understand how patients are doing in these settings.”

Yeh and his colleagues suggest developing that system is an important step in ensuring that the right patients are treated at outpatient clinics.

“We need better guidelines, so we don't leave it up to patients and physicians,” he said. “We need more data and collaborative action to develop and adopt those guidelines.”

Yeh and Husaini reported no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

DISCLOSURES August 21, 2025  



This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Let's talk about student loan debt. Most of us in medicine are carrying six-figure debt, and honestly, it can feel really paralyzing. Here are a few tips to get ahead. 

First, know your loan type — federal vs private — because repayment options can differ. 

Second, if you're working at a nonprofit hospital, look into public service loan forgiveness, PSLF, because it can actually wipe out your remaining balance after 10 years of qualifying payments.

Third, consider enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan during residency. Keep these payments low and sustainable, and start paying into these qualifying months. 

Last, use tools or websites that help you create a budget, or even consider consulting a student loan advisor. 

Honestly, as scary as they are, ignoring your loans makes them even scarier.Having a plan gives you a little bit of control.

5-Fluorouracil 4% cream achieved total clearance in 54.5% and partial clearance in 24.2% of hyperkeratotic actinic keratosis (AK) lesions at 3 months, demonstrating a good safety profile with high patient tolerability.

""This study adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the effectiveness of 5-FU [5-fluorouracil] 4% cream in the treatment of AKs. Although data on its efficacy in treating hyperkeratotic lesions remains limited, these initial findings highlight its potential as a valuable addition to the currently poor therapeutic options for hyperkeratotic AKs,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Federica Li Pomi, Department of Precision Medicine in Medical, Surgical and Critical Care, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy. It was published online on August 16, 2025, in Dermatology and Therapy.

This study was limited by the absence of a control group, which prevented direct comparisons with other treatment modalities; the small sample size, which limited statistical power; and a short follow-up, which did not allow the assessment of long-term efficacy or recurrence rates. Additionally, the lack of histopathologic confirmation of lesion clearance may have led to an overestimation of treatment success rates.

This study did not receive any specific funding. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

An analysis of a real-world US practice revealed that a substantial proportion of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) who initiated dupilumab remained adherent at 12 months. Among those who discontinued therapy, over 40% resumed treatment within a short timeframe.

“Future studies examining discontinuation reasons and persistence patterns across type 2 comorbidity and AERD [aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease] subgroups would enhance our understanding of dupilumab use in CRSwNP patients,” the authors of the study wrote.

Zhixiao Wang, PhD, with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, New York, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on August 15 in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global.

Reasons for dupilumab discontinuation could not be determined, dispensing for comorbid asthma or atopic dermatitis was not captured, and the 1-year continuous enrollment requirement may have introduced selection bias. In addition, the study findings may not be generalizable to other publicly insured or uninsured patients, and reliance on a subjective gap definition in claims data may have resulted in imprecise records of discontinuation timing.

A new review reveals how everyday foods and hidden exposures to formaldehyde may fuel insulin resistance and chip away at memory, but also points to dietary patterns and emerging therapies that could help reduce the risk.



Study: Dietary formaldehyde: a silent aggravator of diabetes and cognitive impairments. Image Credit: Lightspring  / Shutterstock

In a recent review published in the journal Nutrition & Diabetes, researchers synthesized evidence linking diet-derived formaldehyde (FA) with insulin resistance (IR), diabetes mellitus (DM), and cognitive impairment, and outlined practical risk-reduction strategies.

ALDH2 enzyme deficiency – caused by common genetic mutations – dramatically impairs the body's ability to clear formaldehyde, allowing it to accumulate in tissues and accelerate diabetic complications..

One in ten adults worldwide lives with DM, and millions hover on the edge with impaired glucose control. Daily choices like packaged snacks, sugary beverages, quick-fry meats, and certain seafoods shape long-term risk.

Less obvious is a dietary passenger: FA, a small reactive molecule found naturally in foods (e.g., 1–98 mg/kg in fish, 5.7–20 mg/kg in meat), released from packaging, and generated from precursors like fructose, choline, and creatine. 

At physiological levels (0.01–0.08 mM), FA acts as a neuromodulator supporting memory, but excess FA can worsen insulin resistance and nudge cognition off course. 

With urbanization, ultra-processed foods, occupational exposures, and indoor air pollution rising, exposures may accumulate over meals and workplaces. Further research is needed to define dose-response thresholds, vulnerable groups, and practical strategies to limit harm.

FA is a reactive carbonyl present in everyday life. It occurs naturally in fish, meat, milk, fruits, and vegetables, can form during cooking and processing, and may leach from melamine-FA kitchenware.

Typical diets deliver 1.5–14 mg daily, but exposure is uneven: seafood and processed meats tend to carry more, and frequent ultra-processed foods add additional sources.

Small repeated inputs matter because they stack on top of endogenous generation from nutrients, potentially aggravating IR and cognition, issues that already touch families coping with DM, aging parents at risk of memory decline, and busy workers who rely on convenience foods.

Several common nutrients become FA precursors. Fructose degrades into reactive carbonyls, including FA, 4.6–271× more readily than glucose.

Choline and carnitine in red meat and some fish are converted by the gut microbiota to trimethylamine, then oxidized in the liver to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO); demethylation of TMAO can release FA and has been linked to pancreatic beta-cell stress. 

Creatine in meat enters cells through creatine transporter-1 (CrT1) and is handled by creatine kinase (CK), producing sarcosine that feeds mitochondrial sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH), a source of endogenous FA. 

Additionally, semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) generates FA from methanol or methylamines. Add in occasional leaching from food-contact materials, and dietary patterns can tip FA balance toward excess.

SSAO enzyme activity spikes in diabetic patients, acting like a factory overdrive that churns out extra formaldehyde from everyday compounds like methylamines.

Animal studies show that formalin injections acutely raise blood glucose. Human data indicate that circulating FA is higher in people with DM.

Mechanistically, high extracellular glucose induces intracellular calcium ion (Ca²⁺) influx and activates mitochondrial SARDH, and upregulates SSAO, which increases FA formation. FA, in turn, promotes glycogen breakdown to glucose and chemically modifies insulin so it binds its receptor less effectively.

The result is a feed-forward loop: hyperglycemia generates FA; FA worsens hyperglycemia; continued elevation stresses tissues central to metabolic control. This loop helps explain why glucose lowering alone may not normalize metabolic and cognitive outcomes when FA burden remains high.

IR reflects reduced cellular responsiveness to insulin, while FA can impair the system at multiple levels. At pre-receptor, FA forms adducts with arginine, lysine, and tyrosine on insulin, changing conformation and lowering affinity for the insulin receptor (I-R). At the receptor, similar chemistry and oxidative stress may alter I-R structure or decrease expression, reducing signal initiation.

Post-receptor: FA-triggered inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress blunt insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) signaling and downstream glucose transport. Together, these hits compromise everyday physiology, such as post-meal glucose disposal in muscle and suppression of hepatic glucose output, making ordinary meals more likely to produce prolonged hyperglycemia.

Pumpkin seed oil extract demonstrated protective effects in rodent studies, significantly reducing formaldehyde-induced damage to organs like the liver and kidneys.

FA activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) in macrophages, upregulating lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).

The consequence is more lactate and nitric oxide (NO) and a pro-inflammatory milieu that interferes with insulin action. FA elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and suppresses antioxidant systems such as thioredoxin, while chronic hyperglycemia generates hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) as part of normal signaling, increasing redox load. 

Mitochondria struggle under this pressure: membrane potential falls, respiratory enzymes are inhibited, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production falters. These redox and bioenergetic stresses converge on tissues that set the tone for fasting glucose and lipid handling.

At trace levels, FA acts as a gaseous neuromodulator; at higher concentrations it becomes neurotoxic. FA can cross-link cysteine and lysine on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B, weakening synaptic plasticity essential for learning.

In mice, loss of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), a key FA-degrading enzyme, raises FA, worsens spatial memory, and aggravates hyperglycemia, whereas ALDH2 overexpression improves both memory and glycemia.

In people with DM, brain IR and vascular change already threaten cognition; excess FA adds another nudge in the wrong direction. 

For families, this means that the same exposures that derail glucose may also chip away at attention and memory over time.

Creatine supplements – often used by athletes – temporarily elevate hippocampal formaldehyde levels in mice, suggesting a direct diet-brain pathway.

Exposure mixtures can be improved, as a Mediterranean-style pattern, characterized by vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and fish in moderation, is associated with lower DM risk and fewer additives. Limiting high-fructose products and processed meats reduces FA precursors.

Experimental data suggest FA-buffering options: pumpkin constituents blunt FA-induced oxidative injury; the alkaloid trigonelline from fenugreek curbs microbial conversion of choline; tea polyphenols and phytic acid can inhibit TMAO demethylase in fish products. 

Beyond diet, better kitchen ventilation, careful heat management, avoiding occupational FA sources, and avoiding damaged melamine-based ware may help reduce non-dietary inputs at home and work.

Glycemic control, nutrition, activity, and medicines remain core, yet FA biology opens adjunct avenues. Some agents decrease FA or enhance clearance in preclinical models: omega-3 fatty acids, silymarin, and hydrogen sulfide donors improve cognition or metabolic readouts; metformin may bind FA directly, hinting at dual benefit.

Most FA scavengers lack brain specificity or blood-brain barrier penetration; long-term safety is uncertain; and the precise molecular ties among FA, the insulin receptor, and epigenetic regulation need clarification. 

Priorities include brain-targeted scavengers, combination strategies with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, and biomarkers to monitor FA burden and treatment response.

This review proposes that diet-derived FA is a plausible, modifiable contributor to IR, hyperglycemia, and diabetes-related cognitive impairment. Mechanistic data show that FA can be generated from fructose, choline, carnitine, creatine, and SSAO pathways, can inactivate insulin, stress the I-R, and NMDA receptor function.

Observational and experimental findings together outline a feed-forward loop between FA and high glucose. 

Clinically, pairing glucose control with exposure reduction, improving dietary patterns, limiting processed meats and high-fructose foods, mitigating occupational risks, and optimizing home air may help. 

Future trials should test brain-penetrant FA scavengers and integrated lifestyle-pharmacologic approaches.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Greener neighborhoods linked to lower depression in older adults during the pandemic","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250820/Greener-neighborhoods-linked-to-lower-depression-in-older-adults-during-the-pandemic.aspx","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 02:32:00 GMT","

A new national study led by researchers from Carleton University and the University of Toronto reveals that older adults living in greener neighborhoods were less likely to experience depression during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Using data from over 13,000 urban-dwelling participants in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), researchers found that access to nearby green spaces - from public parks and playing fields to tree canopy cover and private gardens along neighbourhood streets - may act as a mental health buffer, especially for those without a prior history of depression, those with fewer economic resources and those with mobility limitations.

The study uncovered four main findings.

Urban areas with more vegetation were associated with lower rates of depression during the Pandemic. People who were not depressed before COVID-19 but lived in greener neighborhoods were significantly less likely to develop depression.

""Urban greenery wasn't just a backdrop - it played a protective mental health role in one of the most stressful global events in recent history,"" said Dr. Paul J. Villeneuve, lead author and Professor in the Department of Neuroscience, Carleton University, Canada.

Living in green neighborhoods was especially protective for lower-income Canadians. The mental health benefits of residential greenness, which was determined by satellite data, were more pronounced among people with lower wealth - especially those who were not previously depressed.

""Our findings suggest that green spaces may have played a modest, yet meaningful, role in supporting the mental well-being of lower-income Canadians during the pandemic, offering some relief amid deepening socio-economic inequities,"" said co-author Susanna Abraham Cottagiri, doctoral candidate at the School of Medicine at Queen's University.

People with mobility challenges gained more from living in greener neighbourhoods. Among individuals without pre-existing depression, those with mobility issues saw stronger benefits from greenness - possibly because their access to more distant green spaces were restricted.

""When mobility is limited, the greenery right outside your door may play a particularly important role in supporting mental health and well-being,"" said co-author Dr. Ying Jiang, Senior Epidemiologist at the Public Health Agency of Canada.

People who, prior to the pandemic, had rarely visited places in their neighbourhood outside their own yard saw a greater protective effect from living in greener neighbourhoods during the pandemic. The less one ventured out prior to the pandemic, the more the presence of greenery and green spaces in their neighbourhood positively impacted their mental health during the pandemic.

""It appears that the psychological value of green space may increase when social connections are restricted,"" said Dr. Margaret de Groh, study co-author.

The authors suggest that the findings call for a rethinking of urban planning and mental health policy in Canada.

""There is a need to expand equitable access to green space, particularly in lower-income neighborhoods, to protect and preserve local greenery, even during public health emergencies, and to integrate green infrastructure into mental health resilience strategies,"" said co-author Professor Esme Fuller-Thomson at the University of Toronto's Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work and director of the Institute for Life Course & Aging. 

This study is one of the few longitudinal analyses of mental health and green space during the pandemic. The researchers drew on satellite data to assess greenness and determine its link to validated depression measures across two time points: pre-pandemic and six months into the pandemic.

The study also sheds light on under-explored issues, such as how socioeconomic status, mobility limitations, and social behavior influence the mental health benefits of greenery. However, the authors caution that some of the most vulnerable Canadians - such as those in long-term care - were not represented in their sample.

A new publication highlights the success of an international partnership working to strengthen nursing and midwifery in the Caribbean. ""Fostering International Collaborations to Inform Nursing and Midwifery Policy: A Caribbean Initiative,"" appears in the International Nursing Review. It was led by Penn Nursing's Eileen T. Lake, PhD, RN, FAAN, the Edith Clemmer Steinbright Professor in Gerontology, with Carmen Alvarez, PhD, CRNP, CNM, FAAN, Associate Professor of Nursing, serving as co-author.

The initiative was created to support the strategic goals of the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) for nursing and midwifery workforce development in the Caribbean region. The Caribbean faces significant challenges in this area, including high rates of migration and critical workforce shortages. Together, the CC collaborative streamlined the process for collecting comprehensive (i.e., (education, practice, and policy), region-wide data and reduced the burden on survey respondents.

The publication details the development, implementation, and impact of the initiative. Key structures, displayed in the colorful Figure 2, included the Pan American Collaborating Centers for Nursing and Midwifery (PANMCC) network, formal leadership, and support from PAHO. The process involved regular communication, stakeholder engagement, and a collaborative approach to survey design.

The collaboration led to the successful creation and implementation of a comprehensive survey to 20 Caribbean countries, which resulted in a 100% response rate from the country Chief Nursing Officers and a 60% response rate from directors of higher education. Unexpected benefits of the initiative included the strengthening of the PANMCC network and the creation of new opportunities for collaboration.

""The paper's findings demonstrate the potential for coordinated efforts to inform nursing and midwifery human resources for health policy and practice in regions with limited resources,"" said Lake, who also serves as Associate Director of Penn Nursing's Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research.

Lake and Alvarez represent Penn Nursing's Collaborating Center (CC) for Nursing and Midwifery, which is designated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to fulfill activities to address WHO priorities. Lake spearheaded this initiative that included six other Pan American CCs and staff of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), comprising a total of 15 co-authors who collaborated over 18 months.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Biology-aware machine learning enables efficient cell culture media optimization","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250820/Biology-aware-machine-learning-enables-efficient-cell-culture-media-optimization.aspx","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 02:37:00 GMT","

Cell culture is a foundational technology widely used across fields such as pharmaceutical production, regenerative medicine, food science, and materials engineering. A critical component of successful cell culture is the culture medium-a solution containing essential nutrients that support cell growth. Therefore, optimizing the culture medium for specific applications is vital. Recently, machine learning has become a powerful tool for efficient media optimization. However, the experimental data used to train such models often exhibit biological variability caused by fluctuations in cell behavior and noise from experimental procedures or equipment. This variability can significantly reduce the predictive accuracy of machine learning models.

In this study, researchers developed a machine learning model that explicitly accounts for biological variability and applied it to identify optimal formulations for serum-free culture media. CHO-K1 cells (derived from Chinese hamster ovary) were cultured in various media, and cell concentrations were measured to quantify biological variability. The researchers integrated data on medium composition, biological variability, and cell density into a machine learning framework that combined multiple algorithms. They further employed active learning-an iterative cycle of model training and experimental validation.

As a result, they successfully developed a serum-free culture medium that achieved approximately 1.6-fold higher cell density compared to commercially available products. Since the medium was specifically optimized for CHO-K1 cells, the study demonstrated the model's ability to capture the unique nutritional needs of individual cell types. These findings are expected to aid in the development of more efficient culture media for pharmaceutical manufacturing and regenerative medicine. Given that biological variability is inherent to biological experiments, the proposed approach holds broad applicability across diverse areas of biological research.

UCSF scientists caught cancer cells in the act of breaking into fat cells and releasing their fat. The energy heist seems to be critical for the growth of deadly breast cancer. 

When triple-negative breast cancer grows, the fat cells around it seem to shrink.

UCSF researchers have discovered that the cells of these tumors, which are among the deadliest types of breast cancer, build molecular tunnels, called gap junctions, into nearby fat cells. The tumor cells then send instructions that trigger the fat cells to release stores of energy that could feed the cancer.

Blocking the gap junctions stopped tumors from growing.

Cancers thrive by hijacking the body's energy sources and we've identified how this works in triple negative breast cancer.""

Andrei Goga, PhD, professor of cell and tissue biology at UCSF, co-leader of the Breast Oncology Program in the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, and senior author of the paper

The study, which appears in Nature Communications on Aug. 20, was funded by the Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health. 

Goga and his team made their discovery by analyzing fat and tumor cells from breast cancer patients, as well as laboratory models of breast cancer. 

The findings have immediate clinical implications. Although no one is yet testing drugs that block gap junctions for breast cancer, there are ongoing clinical trials using these drugs for brain cancer.

""This is a golden opportunity for us to develop effective strategies to treat the most aggressive forms of breast cancer.""

People want to stay healthy and active for as long as possible. But how young and resilient is our body actually? Researchers at ETH Zurich, Empa, Caltech and the University Hospital Basel now want to make our biological age precise and easy to measure. The newly launched AGE RESIST project is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) and aims to determine new biomarkers in sweat using wearable sensors.

Aging is a lifelong process that affects us all. And yet it is still a poorly understood biological phenomenon. It is clear that fitness and susceptibility to certain diseases change over the course of a lifetime and that medical treatments must be adapted to the body's actual condition. But how old is a person really? As old as they feel? Or as old as it says on the ID?

As chronological age, measured in years of lifetime, only tells us a limited amount about a person's physical condition, research has long been trying to determine a person's actual biological age. For example, various blood parameters, so-called molecular biomarkers, which have to be analyzed in the laboratory, are an - albeit complex - method of determining our biological age.

A research team led by Noé Brasier (ETH Zurich) with the participation of Empa, Caltech (California Institute of Technology) and the University Hospital Basel is now working on a simpler yet precise measurement method for new biomarkers in sweat in order to track down biological age and thus better understand the process of ageing, longevity and resilience.

The recently launched project AGE clock for RESIlience in SweaT, or AGE RESIST for short, funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), brings together researchers from the clinical, medical research and sensor technology sectors to develop a convenient portable sensor for sweat analysis. New molecular biomarkers in sweat are measured and combined with other physiological parameters.

Thanks to the high precision of the sensors on the skin, we continuously obtain reliable data on the physiological state of the body.""

Simon Annaheim from Empa's Biomimetic Membranes and Textiles laboratory in St. Gallen

Such an age clock could therefore provide important information about a person's physical resilience and resistance to stress. In this way, the age clock also helps to adapt medical treatments in a personalized - and therefore more effective - way to the respective condition of patients. Side effects and risks could thus be reduced, and therapies could be used in a more targeted and effective manner.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Australian researchers identify GATOR1 complex as key to preventing lymphoma","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250821/Australian-researchers-identify-GATOR1-complex-as-key-to-preventing-lymphoma.aspx","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 13:15:00 GMT","

Australian researchers have used an innovative genome-wide screening approach to identify genes, and their encoded proteins, that play critical roles in the prevention of lymphoma development, revealing new potential treatment targets for these blood cancers. 

The study, published in Nature Communications today, has identified a group of proteins known as the GATOR1 complex as essential tumor suppressors. 

The GATOR1 complex normally functions as a 'brake' on cellular growth by regulating pathways that control cell growth and metabolism. When GATOR1 components are lost or defective, this protective mechanism fails, allowing cells to grow uncontrollably. 

The research is a collaboration between the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute (ONJCRI), WEHI, and the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. 

The team utilized sophisticated pre-clinical models of aggressive lymphoma to systematically test the function of all known genes in this complex. Their comprehensive screening approach revealed that when any of the GATOR1 genes are lacking, lymphoma development is dramatically accelerated, identifying the GATOR1 complex as a crucial suppressor of blood cancer development. 

Co-lead author Dr Margaret Potts said: ""The best thing about performing a well-designed CRISPR screen is that you will always find something. 

""Our unbiased screening approach looked at all genes, rather than just a subset of them. By not limiting our investigation to known pathways, we found expected as well as unexpected tumor suppressor genes and pathways, such as GATOR1."" 

Strikingly, existing drugs that target the same cellular pathways that GATOR1 typically controls were highly effective at slowing the growth of lymphomas in GATOR1-deficient pre-clinical models. 

These drugs have previously had limited success in cancer treatment, and this may be because researchers have not been able to identify which patients would respond well to these therapeutics. 

""Our paper begins the exploration into this precision medicine opportunity,"" shared Dr Potts. 

Prof Marco Herold, CEO of ONJCRI, Head of the La Trobe School of Cancer Medicine and senior author of the Nature Communications paper, said: 

""Our pre-clinical lymphoma model is driven by high levels of the oncogene MYC, an abnormality that can be found in ~70% of all human cancers. When GATOR1 is lacking, it removes a critical brake that normally slows MYC-driven malignancy. 

This exciting discovery provides a new insight into the development and sustained expansion of cancer, which we hope will underpin the development of more effective, targeted treatments for cancer."" 

According to the Global Cancer Observatory, there were over 630,000 new cases of lymphoma worldwide in 2022, highlighting the urgent need for better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive this disease.

The research was led by Dr Margaret Potts, Dr Shinsuke Mizutani, and Dr Yexuan Deng, under the supervision of Prof Marco Herold, Prof Andreas Strasser (WEHI), and A/Prof Kristin Brown (Peter Mac).

The European Food Information Council (EUFIC) has released the final research reports of its survey exploring how nutrition professionals in Spain and Portugal view plant-based dairy alternatives (PBDAs) such as soy, oat, almond, rice, and coconut-based drinks and yoghurts.

The survey reveals broad professional support: 88% of nutrition professionals in Spain and 93% in Portugal agree that PBDAs can be part of a healthy diet.

The findings come at a time of evolving dietary habits, growing interest in plant-based foods, and continued debate on how such foods should be reflected in public health guidance and sustainability policies.

Strong support: 88% of Spanish and 93% of Portuguese professionals recognise PBDAs as part of a healthy diet.

Dietary guidelines: 78% in Spain and 76% in Portugal support including PBDAs in national dietary guidelines.

Fortification: 81% in Spain and 96% in Portugal believe PBDAs should be fortified with vitamins and/or minerals.

Top reasons for recommending PBDAs: lactose intolerance, vegan/plant-based diets, and dietary diversity.

Awareness gaps: Differences remain in professionals' perceptions of nutritional value, processing, environmental impact, and fortification—highlighting the importance of clearer guidance and communication to support informed recommendations.

The newly released report goes beyond headline figures to provide:

Detailed statistics, charts, and comparisons with previous research

Insights into professionals' familiarity, exposure, and consumption patterns

Qualitative responses illustrating reasoning and justifications

Implications for nutrition research, practice, and policy

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Syosset's Loradana Paletta is 14 and has an NIL deal, USWNT experience and big soccer goals","https://www.newsday.com/sports/soccer/loradana-paletta-syosset-nil-uswnt-k6zq9xc6","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:59:39 GMT","

Terms such as “pioneer” and “trailblazer” often are mentioned too loosely in sports, but with an athlete like Loradana Paletta, it's difficult to argue those descriptors.

Paletta, a 14-year-old soccer player from Syosset, became the first girl to play on the boys NYCFC MLS Next team. MLS Next is an elite youth league operated by Major League Soccer, with teams beginning at age 13.

This summer, Paletta, a midfielder, played on the United States U-17 Women's National Team in the 4 Nations Tournament in Mexico City, competing against Canada, Mexico and Costa Rica. Paletta started the majority of games, despite being three years younger than some of her teammates. USA won the tournament.

Before leaving for Mexico City, Paletta became one of the youngest athletes in American sports history to sign a Name, Image and Likeness deal. The young soccer star signed the NIL deal with Lotto, an Italian sports brand, in July, becoming Lotto's first U.S. Amateur NIL partner.

All this before her first day of attending Syosset High School, which is September 2.

“I've always dreamed of being in the spot I'm in right now. I never really thought it was going to happen,” Paletta said. “But through all my hard work and pushing and training and early mornings, I feel like I deserve this. I'm humble about it, and I'm just going to keep going.”

Paletta has decided not to play soccer for Syosset High School this year.

Her lofty goals  include playing  professionally for a major club in Europe and winning Olympic gold medals and World Cups for Team USA.

“It's definitely going to take a lot of work,” Paletta said. “I'm definitely going to need to keep pushing. I'm going to have to improve on the little things, but when I perfect them, I know I'm going to be a better player and I'm going to strive to win the World Cup.”

Chris Wingert, who was born in Babylon and attended St. John the Baptist High School before playing 14 seasons in the MLS, became a FIFA-licensed soccer agent after his playing career. Through family, he heard of Paletta and offered guidance. Wingert, who represents professional athletes, later took on Paletta and represented her in the deal with Lotto.

“I saw her play with NYCFC boys and I thought she was a boy with long hair,” Wingert recalls of seeing Paletta play a few years ago. “I didn't realize she was a female. She was unbelievable.”

As a former top men's soccer player, Wingert was shocked to hear Paletta was able to excel against the boys as a teenager. But after seeing her play, he understood how she does it. Wingert was impressed with her quickness, technique and tactical skill, but another aspect garnered his attention the most.

“I don't mean to sound dramatic, but I don't think I've been around a teenager who has this mindset,” Wingert said. “It's completely unique to anything I've ever seen before … I truly think in 10 years from now if we're talking about her as one of the best players in the world, it's going to be her mentality.”

Paletta has played and trained with the U15 and U-16 Women's National Teams throughout her young career. She'll be with the U-17 Women's National Team again as it plays friendlies in Spain from Aug. 22 through Sept. 1 as the final training camp and matches before the U-17 Women's World Cup in Morocco this fall. Paletta hopes to make the U-17 Women's World Cup roster.

Paletta said she was surprised by the initial U-17 team call-up, but she also felt confident she could play with the older girls.

“It felt intimidating, but at the same time, I know being called up three years that they are going to be bigger and stronger,” Paletta said. “But I know I have my ways to get around. And me just being myself when I get there, I knew I'd do well.”

A lot of those lessons come from playing with the boys. Paletta, who has two older brothers, has played on boys team ever since she began playing soccer at age 4. The only time she shares the field with girls is with national teams, and she hopes to play with the boys as long as she physically can.

“It's their time with growth spurts, so they are definitely going to be bigger and taller than me and more physical,” Paletta said. “But that's my time to shine where I have to show that I belong there and keep my place.”

Wingert said Paletta had offers from multiple companies to sign an NIL deal this summer, but they felt Lotto would give her a chance to be a featured athlete. Wingert didn't disclose any financial arrangements between Paletta and Lotto, but Paletta is eligible to receive financial payment without losing collegiate or high school eligibility.

The New York State Public High School Athletic Association (NYSPHSAA) permits NIL deals while allowing student-athletes to retain amateur status and eligibility, as long as the endorsement deal isn't affiliated or showcased with their school, section or NYSPHSAA. Paletta's NIL deal does not conflict with the NYSPHSAA Amateur Rule since she did not receive her NIL through Syosset High School or any county or state means.

Paletta said she's “really proud” of earning an NIL deal at a young age, and feels a strong partnership at Lotto.

“I love rocking their gear, they really make me feel comfortable,” Paletta said. “I love the gear they send me, the matching sets, the cleats, it just makes me feel like such a professional, even though I'm just 14.”

Sometimes, even she can't believe all she's already achieved at 14 years old.

“It's really mind-blowing,” Paletta said, “but I've worked hard to be in this position.”

And Wingert wouldn't doubt any of Paletta's goals, or her potential impact on U.S. women's soccer.

“I don't think there's anything outside the realm of what's realistic for her,” Wingert said. “Her ability and where she's at right now is truly different from anything I've seen. And I think U.S. Soccer, the way they've handled things, I think would tell you she's absolutely an outlier and they see the potential for some groundbreaking stuff to happen.”

Former Cincinnati, Miami & Seattle Right Back Added to 2025 RSL Roster Ahead of Saturday's Minnesota Match; Two-Time U.S. World Cup Defender Also Played in Europe w/ Tottenham, Sunderland, Newcastle, Galatasaray

HERRIMAN, Utah (Thursday, August 21, 2025) – Real Salt Lake today acquired Major League Soccer veteran DeAndre Yedlin from FC Cincinnati in exchange for $304,700 in 2025 General Allocation Money (GAM). Yedlin will immediately be added to RSL's 2025 roster, the 32-year-old U.S. Men's National Team star training with Head Coach Pablo Mastroeni's side Thursday and Friday, eligible to compete in this weekend's Claret-and-Cobalt match at home against Minnesota United FC (7:30p MT, America First Field / www.RSL.com/tickets).

“RSL is an historic club in MLS, with an amazing reputation around the League,” said Yedlin from the airport on Wednesday night, prior to his arrival at Salt Lake City International Airport. “I've played with two of the Club's iconic people, Nick Rimando and Kyle Beckerman, and I was coached by Jason Kreis in Miami. I've known Kurt Schmid since my Seattle days, (Director of Recruitment) Jon Spencer is a family friend. Pablo Mastroeni's reputation is excellent with his track record of success on and off the pitch. The culture they've built there is outstanding.”

“As a visitor, I always hated to travel there – it's a tough place to play, at altitude, against a high-energy team. You know you're gonna get a tough game, against a team that plays good football and is fun to watch. RSL has always had what it takes to compete. It was exciting to hear of their interest in me becoming part of the setup at RSL, and something my family and I needed to explore.”

A veteran of 218 career MLS matches with Seattle (2013/14), Inter Miami (2022-24) and Cincinnati (2024/25), Yedlin has scored four career goals in the North American top-flight from his right back position. The three-time MLS All-Star (2013, 2014, 2022) also served as club Captain for Inter Miami's 2023 Leagues Cup championship team, ceding the honor to Lionel Messi upon his late-season arrival. As a second-year professional, Yedlin also raised the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup with Seattle in 2014.

Yedlin also scored four times while playing 187 games of European football from early 2015 to January 2022. Yedlin's European totals include 151 games in England with Newcastle – whom he helped gain promotion in the 2016/17 campaign – as well as Sunderland and Tottenham, prior to a 36-game career with Turkish power Galatasaray in 2021/22.

Yedlin continues: “From one homegrown to another, it has been great to see how Justen Glad has done there, building a career at his boyhood club; Diego Luna is a guy who has blown up on the scene by being anextremely hard worker and willingness to work on both sides of the ball; when your attacking guys and technically proficient players buy in, as Diego has, with some grit and a chip on his shoulder, it inspires the whole group to do the defensive work and never stop fighting.”

“My family is excited for the move, looking forward to living in the mountains, which will be a whole different world with the nature there,” added Yedlin, who is a voracious reader off the field, also exploring his artistic side with clothing design and pursuing environmental endeavors through his recyclable/vegan Sokito brand football boots. “I'm excited to get back to the West, as I've always felt at home in the mountains, my grandfather and I used to go hiking a lot when I was a child. I find them very calming and relaxing. My wife is from The Bronx, and she cannot wait.”

Born on July 9, 1993 as DeAndre Roselle Yedlin in Seattle, Wash., becoming Seattle Sounders FC's first-ever homegrown signing, returning to his hometown after attending the University of Akron for two seasons(2011/12). Yedlin is a two-time FIFA World Cup selection (2014 & 2022), boasting 81 caps with the U.S. Men's National Team over a decade-long span from 2014 to 2023.

“We are absolutely thrilled to welcome DeAndre to our club,” said RSL Chief Soccer Officer  Kurt Schmid, whose team boasts five of the remaining eight reg. season matches at home. “He is a player of tremendous quality whose experience at the highest levels of the game will be invaluable to our team. Beyond his skill on the field, his leadership and professionalism will strengthen our locker room and help set the tone. We believe DeAndre's impact will be felt immediately, and we're excited about the role he will play in driving our success now and into the future.

Yedlin, who will wear jersey No. 2 for RSL this season, joins nine other RSL players to own FIFA World Cup appearances on their career resume, with Eddie Pope (2006), Robbie Findley (2010), Nick Rimando (2014) and Kyle Beckerman (2014) also representing the United States. Former RSL midfielder Andy Williams(Jamaica, 1998), Douglas Sequiera (Costa Rica, 2006), Alvaro Saborio (Costa Rica, 2010/14), Carlos Salcedo (Mexico, 2018) and Bryan Oviedo (Costa Rica, 2018, 2022) also competed for their home nations in the globe's largest event. Pope, Findley, Rimando, Beckerman and Oviedo each participated in the quadrennial event while an active member of RSL.

Only eight players in Real Salt Lake history have played more games in Europe than Yedlin – Alfredo Ortuño (511), Nedum Onuoha (354), fellow 2025 addition Johnny Russell (334), Damir Kreilach (277), Giuseppe Rossi (268), Bobby Wood (230), new teammate Diogo Gonçalves (220) and Everton Luiz (204).

Real Salt Lake (9-13-4, 31 points, 10th West / 20th Shield) returns this week to America First Field in Sandy with Saturday's 7:30p MT Major League Soccer regular-season match against Minnesota United FC (13-6-8, 47 points, 2nd West / 6thShield).

Iconic RSL voice David James and former MLS goalkeeper Jay Nolly will call the game for KSL Sports Radio (1160 AM / 97.5 FM), with Nelson Moran in his 21st season as RSL's Spanish radio home on both 102.3 KDUT FM / 106.3 FM KBMG.

RSL returns home to play five of its next six contests on Utah soil from Saturday through early October, before ending the 2025 reg. season campaign away at Seattle on Oct. 11 in a rescheduled match and at St. Louis for MLS “Decision Day” on Oct. 18. RSL returns home – where it boasts five wins and two draws against just one loss since June 1 – looking to rebound from a pair of chaotic and controversial one-goal losses each of the last two weekends away at Charlotte FC and New York Red Bulls.

RSL now puts its 7-6-3 (W-L-T) home mark on the Wasatch Front thus far this year in MLS, Champions Cup and Leagues Cup matches on the line against Minnesota on Saturday. A year ago, RSL amassed a 12-3-4 (W-L-T) record at home, where the Club has traditionally enjoyed a fortress-like record of success, winning nearly 70% of games and averaging just under two points per game in parts of 17 seasons across all competitions in Sandy.

Mauricio Pedroza and Janusz Michallik discuss Ricardo Pepi's future at PSV. (2:43)

The opening weeks of the European club season have seen some auspicious starts. Norwich City's Josh Sargent continues to bang in the goals, with his tally against Portsmouth already giving him three on the young season. Chris Richards and Crystal Palace secured an impressive road shutout at Chelsea, and Sergiño Dest continued his fine form for PSV Eindhoven.

The most notable performances of the weekend came from players in Christian Pulisic and Johnny Cardoso who have had some attention around them -- not all of it positive.

Throughout the season, ESPN will be monitoring the progress of the U.S. men's national team player pool, delivering insights into those whose form or fitness has made them particularly intriguing. We call it the USMNT's Countdown to the men's World Cup.

ESPN will count down to June 11 every week so that way, when the U.S. team is announced for this highly anticipated World Cup on home soil, no names on that 26-man roster will come as a surprise.

Welcome to the USMNT's Countdown to the World Cup. Only 295 days to go.

2025-26 minutes: 66
2025-26 FotMob rating: 8.6

Pulisic's summer of discontent -- complete with deciding to skip the Gold Cup, some subtle sniping with U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino, and then a not-so-subtle war-of-words with former USMNT players over his decision -- finally got back to focusing on his actual performances. And after shaking off an ankle injury, Pulisic delivered for his club, scoring Milan's second goal from a sharp reception and finish on the turn in what was a 2-0 win over Bari in the Coppa Italia.

The 66-minute performance reinforced a truism about Pulisic and his USMNT teammates: If he plays well, he'll be praised. If he doesn't, he'll be criticized. Might some of that criticism be over the top? Possibly. But like it or not, this is what he signed up for, and using his docuseries as a platform to complain about said criticism won't change that. With next summer's World Cup now only 10 months away, the scrutiny on Pulisic and his play is only bound to increase. His start to the season is nonetheless encouraging.

There has been plenty of head-scratching when it comes to Cardoso and the USMNT. Namely, why doesn't he replicate his club form at international level? Cardoso's debut for Atléti on Sunday against Espanyol elicited a very different type of question. Why was he subbed out at halftime by manager Diego Simeone?

It's a decision made all the more puzzling given how Cardoso performed. He completed 87.5% of his passes and won 71.4% of his duels. Atlético were up 1-0 when he departed, only to lose the match 3-2 when Espanyol rallied for two goals. Simeone even praised Cardoso for his play and acknowledged he needed to reexamine his decisions.

""I think I learned a lesson,"" he told reporters afterward. ""I'll take something away from that. There's a lesson for me.""

Given that Cardoso earned compliments, it's a start that bodes well for continued playing time on a very competitive squad. Now the challenge for Pochettino is to find a way to get the best out of Cardoso when he dons a different red, white and blue jersey.

There's always a danger in reading too much into preseason. There are youngsters to try out, fitness levels to manage, and in the case of Juventus, there's recovery from a packed summer that included the FIFA Club World Cup. All of that said, when it comes to McKennie, how big of a role will he end up playing for Juve this season? It seems to be an annual query.

Last season, McKennie was ever-present, making a total of 48 league and cup appearances. But if the past three friendlies are anything to go by, the U.S. midfielder will be hard-pressed to repeat that level of activity. As the Serie A opener against Genoa nears this weekend, and with manager Igor Tudor opting for a 3-4-3 formation, McKennie has seen his playing time steadily decrease, with him entering last weekend's friendly against Atalanta in second-half stoppage time. There have also been reports he might be headed to AS Roma.

If McKennie remains with Juve as a squad player, the team's presence in the UEFA Champions League figures to result in plenty of player rotation, but it's a less-than-ideal scenario for McKennie and the USMNT; it also might open the door for a fringe player or two. Middlesbrough's Aidan Morris has impressed in the opening weeks of the season.

If the World Cup started tomorrow, who would make up Pochettino's starting XI? Each week we take our best attempt to name a starting lineup based on form and fitness, which means there's no room for injured players.

Even as Dest returns to health, a competition is brewing for the remaining outside back slots. Antonee Robinson, when healthy, is the presumed starter at left back, but he has yet to even make the gameday roster in recent weeks for Fulham as he continues to recover from offseason knee surgery. One possible option on the left side, Watford's Caleb Wiley, is in a similar situation with a back injury.

The hope is that both players return to the field soon, but in the meantime, Pochettino has plenty of options in an attempt to fill the void. Joe Scally has played on either flank for both club and country, and has been a steady presence on the backline for Borussia Mönchengladbach, making more than 30 appearances in each of the past four seasons. However, Pochettino has shown a clear preference for outside backs who can contribute to the attack, whereas Scally's strengths lie more on the defensive end of the field. Last season, in 32 league appearances, he had no goals or assists, and created only 11 chances.

That has led Pochettino to look at other options. Both Max Arfsten of the Columbus Crew and Orlando City SC's Alex Freeman logged the majority of minutes available at outside back during the Gold Cup. Arfsten showed some vulnerabilities in his defending, but improved as the tournament progressed and chipped in with a goal in the quarterfinal win against Costa Rica. Holstein Kiel's John Tolkin got time in the Gold Cup as well, and started the club season in dream fashion, scoring Kiel's opener in the 2-0 victory over Homburg in the DFB-Pokal. The sequence showed off Tolkin's passing, mobility and finishing ability. His edge in defending means he cracks this week's in-form XI.

That is by no means the extent of Pochettino's options when it comes to outside backs. Tim Weah's debut for Marseille last weekend came as a wing back, and Yunus Musah's early days under new Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri have seen him play in a similar role. Weah has shown flexibility in the past at club level in terms of playing on either flank, although for the USMNT, his value lies farther upfield given his ability to stretch and get behind defenses. The September window should reveal plenty.

Matt Turner, goalkeeper, New England Revolution: 180 minutes in 2025; 7.4 FotMob rating in 2025.

Matt Freese, goalkeeper, New York City FC: 2,250 minutes in 2025; 7.2 FotMob rating in 2025.

Zack Steffen, goalkeeper, Colorado Rapids: 1,800 minutes in 2025; 7.1 FotMob rating in 2025.

Turner might get the nod in the in-form XI, but Steffen is doing all he can to push for more consideration from Pochettino. Steffen's goals prevented mark of 6.33 is the third highest in MLS, showing a level of consistency that was absent last season. The big challenge for Steffen is simply staying healthy. If he does, he should get a chance to battle for the starting goalkeeping spot.

Patrick Schulte, goalkeeper, Columbus Crew: 1,980 minutes in 2025; 6.7 FotMob rating in 2025.

Chris Richards, center back, Crystal Palace: 180 minutes in 2025-26; 7.0 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Tim Ream, center back, Charlotte FC: 1,802 minutes in 2025; 6.6 FotMob rating in 2025.

Mark McKenzie, center back, Toulouse: 90 minutes in 2025-26; 7.5 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

McKenzie remains the leading contender to push for Ream's spot in the center of the USMNT defense, and he delivered a composed performance in Toulouse's season-opening 1-0 win over Nice, completing 93% of his passes and winning 67% of his duels. Consistency with the USMNT has been an issue, but he's off to the right kind of start with his club.

Chris Richards speaks after Crystal Palace's penalty shootout win over Liverpool in the Community Shield.

Cameron Carter-Vickers, center back, Celtic: 180 minutes in 2025-26; 7.7 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Miles Robinson, center back, FC Cincinnati: 2,258 minutes in 2025; 6.9 FotMob rating in 2025.

Johnny Cardoso, midfielder, Atlético Madrid: 45 minutes in 2025-26; 6.7 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Luca de la Torre, midfielder, San Diego FC: 1,995 minutes in 2025; 6.8 FotMob rating in 2025.

Tanner Tessmann, midfielder, Lyon: 90 minutes in 2025-26; 7.6 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Yunus Musah, midfielder, AC Milan: 24 minutes in 2025-26; 6.8 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Sebastian Berhalter, midfielder, Vancouver Whitecaps: 2,470 minutes in 2025; 7.4 FotMob rating in 2025.

Christian Pulisic, attacker, AC Milan: 66 minutes in 2025-26; 8.6 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Tim Weah, attacker, Marseille: 45 minutes in 2025-26; 6.9 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Malik Tillman, attacker, Bayer Leverkusen: 0 minutes in 2025-26; 0.0 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Diego Luna, attacker, Real Salt Lake: 2,005 minutes in 2025; 7.2 FotMob rating in 2025.

Luna sat out last weekend's 1-0 defeat to Charlotte as he was suspended because of a red card he picked up against the New York Red Bulls. Luna now has seven yellow cards and two ejections on the season. He's obviously getting more attention from opponents, but he'll need to find a way to keep his composure as well as the edge with which he plays. Not at all easy, but a trait he'll need to refine.

Alejandro Zendejas, attacker, América: 380 minutes in 2025-26; 7.1 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Zendejas looks to be cooling off a bit ... or is he? During the two tournaments that comprised the 2024-25 Liga MX season, Zendejas had 11 goals from 7.07 xG across 40 matches. So far this season, Zendejas has one goal from 1.36 xG in five matches. So his goals/game are down, but his xG/game is up. Still early days yet, but if Zendejas continues to get chances, his goal scoring should round into form.

Giovanni Reyna, attacker, Borussia Dortmund: 0 minutes in 2025-26; 0.0 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Folarin Balogun, forward, AS Monaco: 0 minutes in 2025-26; 0.0 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Ricardo Pepi, forward, PSV Eindhoven: 28 minutes in 2025-26; 6.0 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Josh Sargent, forward, Norwich City: 227 minutes in 2025-26; 7.4 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

Patrick Agyemang, forward, Derby County: 0 minutes in 2025-26; 0.0 FotMob rating in 2025-26.

The American winger is set to be coming back to MLS

Since turning pro in 2020, Paxten Aaronson has been one of the more intriguing prospects in the USMNT player pool. After breaking through with the Philadelphia Union, Aaronson started gaining the attention of clubs in Europe and ultimately moved to Eintracht Frankfurt in 2023.

The German club elected to loan out Aaronson and he's played for Vitesse and Utrecht in Holland. He had been the subject of further loan rumors in Europe, but it appears his next stop will be back in the United States. According to reports, Aaronson is set to join the Colorado Rapids on an $8 million transfer fee so he can be closer to family and have stability.

Aaronson is just 21 years-old and the move will make him a central part of Colorado's lineup. Currently, the team is sitting in 7th place in the Western Conference and is looking for a boost to push for a playoff spot. The Rapids have 36 goals on the season, ranking 8th out of 15 clubs in the conference, and a creative and versatile attacker brings a greater goal threat as they compete for a post-season run.

Summer Transfer

Window

LIVE

3m ago

Borussia Monchengladbach are in talks over a deal to sign USMNT international Gio Reyna from Borussia Dortmund.

The 22-year-old's contract at Dortmund is set to expire next summer, with the feeling at the club being that a long-term extension would not make sense for either party. Clubs in Spain and Portugal have looked at the attacking midfielder, while Parma in Italy had also previously expressed an interest.

Reyna is thought to be open to the move as he looks for more regular first-team football ahead of next year's World Cup, which the United States will host alongside Canada and Mexico.

A move to Gladbach would see him join up with USMNT team-mate Joe Scally. The pair are close friends after coming through the ranks together at NYCFC.

Reyna was not included in Mauricio Pochettino's 2025 Gold Cup squad this summer as Dortmund wanted him to be part of the squad that travelled to the U.S. for the Club World Cup. Dortmund reached the quarter-finals of the competition, though Reyna only played one game, coming off the bench in a 1-0 group-stage win over Ulsan HD.

Reyna's Dortmund career has been heavily disrupted by injuries since he joined as a 16-year-old in July 2019. He made 26 appearances last season but only five of those were starts. Reyna was sidelined for two and a half months, missing 19 games for club and country, after picking up a groin issue in early September.

He has only started 14 Bundesliga games since the beginning of the 2021-22 season. He spent the second half of the 2023-24 campaign on loan at Premier League side Nottingham Forest, playing in 10 games.

Reyna has featured 147 times for Dortmund, scoring 19 goals and providing 18 assists. He became the youngest player to make 50 Bundesliga appearances aged 18 years and 14 days, a record that has since been broken by Florian Wirtz, who joined Liverpool this summer.

Reyna received his first USMNT call-up in November 2020 and has been capped 32 times, scoring eight goals and representing the nation at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

The end for Reyna at Dortmund has been coming for a while. It's been several years since he was a consistent member of the first team: he started three Bundesliga games last season and just one the year before.

The need for a career reset is self-evident and perhaps Gladbach, who remain a big club, albeit one some way down from its historic peaks in the 1970s, can be an ideal venue to rediscover some momentum.

Talent was not the problem in Dortmund. Instead, it was availability, and Reyna's struggle to avoid the small muscular issues that have so often derailed his progress and prevented him from establishing a rhythm at the Westfalenstadion. Ultimately, that is why the club have allowed his contract to run down and now, with a year left until its end, are happy to allow him to leave.

Can Reyna regain his status in the game? Within his camp, there's hope that the right club and the faith of the right coach could elevate him back in the European perception. For now, though, the aim is simpler: he must find somewhere to play consistently. At just 22, there's plenty of time yet.

World Cup

In the months since Christian Pulisic riled American soccer, as he and his father sparred with former players, after he skipped the Gold Cup and controversy swirled, his former U.S. men's national team coaches heard noise, lots of noise, that they didn't understand.

They listened to fans and pundits questioning Pulisic's commitment to the USMNT. They saw a “Captain America” and face of the program become a polarizing figure, certainly more polarizing than ever before.

And in interviews with The Athletic last week, they pushed back.

“I really think it's nonsense, some of the stuff that was said this summer,” Gregg Berhalter, who coached the national team from 2019 to 2024, said. “Because I know him, and I know how much he cares for it. I know that he would never ask for a break unless he absolutely needed it.”

Jurgen Klinsmann, Pulisic's first USMNT coach, also said he understood the player's desire to rest and recharge, with the 2026 World Cup looming.

“A lot of American media were negative about it, but they didn't look at the bigger picture,” Klinsmann said. “And the interesting discussion, obviously, was that former players and pundits were very critical, but they did exactly the same thing in their careers.”

Bruce Arena, who succeeded Klinsmann, made a similar point. In 2017, he selected his Gold Cup squad almost entirely from MLS and Liga MX, giving every European-based USMNT regular that summer off.

“They're making this big stink about (Pulisic) not coming in,” Arena said of the 2025 discourse. “We kept the entire group of European players away, because they were fatigued, and they needed a break. … So, for Christian to take a beating on that, I think, was unfair.

“This whole thing, I kinda find to be a little bit comical.”

It was comical but fierce, and it got to Pulisic.

Prior to 2025, his patriotic zeal had been a cornerstone of his personal brand. “I feel like I've given so much to this team and, truly, no one wants it more than me,” Pulisic said last June. “I promise you that.”

So he was taken aback by the storm that erupted this spring. When he opted out of the Gold Cup, a biennial regional tournament, he was miffed that supporters, including USMNT legends he once idolized, led a wave of blowback.

“To question my commitment, especially towards the national team, in my opinion, that's way out of line,” Pulisic said on a CBS Sports podcast. He bemoaned those who “forget real fast the successes that you've had.”

What he might have miscalculated, though, was that his new USMNT coach had nothing to forget or remember.

Pulisic built equity with Klinsmann, Arena, Berhalter and their assistants. When Mauricio Pochettino took charge last fall, he did not fly to Italy to meet with Pulisic, nor call the AC Milan star to chat about leadership. He wanted to give all American players equal opportunity to impress him. “What I like,” Pochettino said in October, “is to discover.” He spoke about needing to “feel” his new players, and “what we want to feel from them is their commitment, their personality, their character, their capacity to adapt to a new era, a new way to approach the games,” he said.

Previous coaches felt that from Pulisic. It's unclear whether Pochettino has. Their public back-and-forth in June — Pulisic said he “didn't understand” Pochettino's rejection of his request to play in the two pre-Gold Cup friendlies; Pochettino responded: “I am not a mannequin” — raised questions about Pulisic's once-ironclad place in the USMNT.

And it left a fanbase conflicted, feeding on the drama, debating Pulisic like never before.

Pulisic heard the discourse, and, in a recent episode of his “Pulisic” docuseries, countered: “Everyone has had their opinion on me and, in my opinion, disrespected me in a lot of ways, and just completely forgotten about what I've done for this national team for 10 years.”

There's a narrative that emerged amid the USMNT's 2024-25 malaise that the so-called golden generation didn't earn it; that the group of players ushered into the national team after their elders failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup won opportunities with reputation and potential, rather than on the field. As a result, critics say, they're too entitled.

Pulisic, though, did earn it. At 17, he jetted from his German club Borussia Dortmund to Columbus, Ohio, into a national team of hardened vets such as Clint Dempsey and Michael Bradley. And “you quickly, quickly realized: ‘OK, yeah, this kid has something,'” says Matt Besler, a defender on that team.

Off the field, his former teammates and coaches say, Pulisic was “quiet” and “respectful,” wide-eyed and observant. On the field, midfielder Kyle Beckerman recalls, he was “fearless.” In training, he would skin defenders nearly twice his size and age. They had tuned out the hype attached to his name — “when you come into the national team camp, none of that really matters,” Besler explains — but “it didn't take very long for people to understand: ‘Hey, you've gotta give this guy the respect he deserves on the field,'” Besler says.

By the fall of 2016, soon after turning 18, Pulisic had become a USMNT regular. Arena, after replacing Klinsmann at the helm, flew to Germany to meet him. Dave Sarachan, a longtime Arena assistant, remembers Pulisic being “very Landon [Donovan]-like” in their first training sessions of 2017. “His technical ability, and quickness, and pace,” Sarachan says, “immediately struck you that he belongs here.”

What Arena and Sarachan remember most vividly, however, are the tears that gushed from Pulisic after the USMNT lost in Couva, Trinidad. He had scored the lone U.S. goal of a decisive World Cup qualifier, and “he was the best player on the field for us,” Arena says. “If we had other players that stepped up like Christian did at his age, we would not have lost that game.” But they did lose it, 2-1, and fell short of reaching that 2018 World Cup in Russia. “It crushed him,” Arena recalls. In the locker room afterward, Pulisic “was in a state of shock,” Sarachan says. “He was kinda uncontrollable.”

“So,” Arena continues, “when I hear ‘his lack of commitment,' and all of that — I don't buy into that. I think it's misinterpreted.”

Sarachan's reading of the memory, and of Pulisic's anguish, was and is: “This really meant something for him.”

When Sarachan took charge of the USMNT after Arena resigned post-Couva, he, too, flew to Germany for a Dortmund game and dinner with Pulisic. At that table, they sketched out the rest of the 2017-18 calendar and spoke about which national-team camps Pulisic would attend. He stayed in Dortmund, far away from friendlies against Portugal and Paraguay, in November and the following March. “I love coming into national-team camps,” a 19-year-old Pulisic later said, “but … I have to make the right decisions, and keep myself fresh.”

When Pulisic did finally grace a Sarachan camp, “he put club first,” Sarachan recalls. He was the last of 22 players to arrive (after fulfilling obligations to Dortmund and sponsors elsewhere). He was among the first to depart (before two U.S. friendlies in Europe). His performance in a friendly against Bolivia, Pulisic's only USMNT game between October 2017 and November 2018, “was a little bit of a token appearance,” Sarachan recalls. At halftime, the interim coach approached Pulisic and said: “It would be nice if you were sweating.” Pulisic, Sarachan recalls, half-smiled.

Sarachan, though, didn't blame Pulisic for prioritizing himself. For the national team, “that was a dead year, in many ways,” he says.

Instead, he sensed the same thing he senses now. “We know Christian. And I know his love for his country and his team,” Sarachan says. “And he'll be there when it counts. He'll be there when it counts.”

Berhalter sensed something similar when he, too, flew to Germany and sat down with Pulisic shortly after getting the USMNT job in December 2018. They dined at an Italian restaurant, and Pulisic, Berhalter recalls, was initially “guarded” and “skeptical.”

But “what I gathered most from the conversation,” Berhalter says, “and that led to be true throughout my tenure, is how much he cares, and how much he wants to be successful with the national team.”

Advertisement

His caring took many forms. And in the early days, his relationship with Berhalter “wasn't always smooth sailing,” the coach recalls. “There were definitely some rocky moments.” On Oct. 15, 2019, in Toronto, Berhalter subbed him out of a 0-0 game against Canada. Pulisic complained and expressed frustration. Berhalter approached his star in the locker room after and explained: “We weren't happy with his performance. … We made this decision based on what we thought was best for the team.”

Pulisic, Berhalter recalls, “was really upset.” But he grew to appreciate a coach who challenged him and delivered honest feedback. After scoring his first goal under Berhalter, then hurting his right thigh in a March 2019 friendly against Chile, Pulisic went to a nearby hospital for scans. When he returned late at night, Berhalter called him down to an office and broached a possible reason for the spate of niggling injuries: “Look, maybe you need to train harder. You need to train more like you play.”

Pulisic's initial thought was: “Who's this guy to tell me this?”

But, Pulisic recalled in 2023, “that's a moment that stuck with me for a long time.”

He began to train with game-like intensity. And by 2022, his injury troubles abated. They'd been the primary source of his inconsistency, a reason for “discrepancies with his performance,” as Berhalter says. Once he learned to preempt them, he became the USMNT's most reliable player.

“We could count on at least an 8-out-of-10 performance from him every game,” Berhalter says. “It got to a point where people knew: ‘OK, this guy's gonna show up.'”

He showed up that winter in Qatar, at his first World Cup. He scored arguably the most important USMNT goal of the past decade, and injured his pelvis in the process.

He also showed up when the spotlights dimmed and most of America forgot about him.

“I'm amazed by Christian,” interim coach Anthony Hudson said after a March 2023 win in Grenada. “Not only is he a talented player but, I can assure you, he just absolutely loves playing for his country. … [He's] such a big player, playing at a big club, a huge value on him, and we go to places like this, and he has no problem giving absolutely everything he has. He is an inspiration for the rest of the group.”

From that point forward, under interim coaches and Berhalter, Pulisic was the captain. There was never a formal declaration, but in every game he started, except one, he wore the armband. He was the player coaches turned to for pregame wisdom. He had become, in Berhalter's words, “an authentic leader.” When he spoke, teammate Tyler Adams said last year, “people look at him, people listen. And people want to follow him.”

So, when Berhalter was fired and Pochettino hired, a journalist asked the new boss: “How much will you lean on leaders in the squad like a Christian Pulisic as you start your first camp?” 

Effectively: What will the leadership structure be?

In his two-minute answer, Pochettino never named Pulisic, nor any other individual.

“I am a coach, and we are a coaching staff, who love to give the possibility to everyone,” Pochettino said. “… Different coaching staffs have different experiences with the player. And for me, the most important thing is to live the experience with them, see them, and see how they behave and how they act.”

Pochettino has since praised Pulisic individually. Last October, he called him a “fantastic player” and “one of the best offensive players in the world.” But his last two experiences with the AC Milan star this spring were, first, a March loss to Canada in which Pulisic appeared to wave away a substitution; and then a May call during which the player explained his desire to skip the Gold Cup.

Pochettino, speaking publicly in May, called it “the best decision” for everyone, keeping in mind that “the principal objective is the World Cup.” But he didn't seem particularly happy about it.

Then, after Pulisic's podcast appearance, he pushed back on the idea that a player could choose when to appear for their national team. He also challenged the premise that Pulisic is the USMNT's top talent. “You say he's the best player. Yes, he's a good player, of course. But he needs to perform,” Pochettino said on the eve of the Gold Cup. “Because I'm going to judge him like [any other player].”

That, Pochettino and players have said, has been a theme ever since the Argentine coach arrived. His message, defender Walker Zimmerman said in June, has been: “I don't care where you play, I care what you do. It's when you show up here, how you perform, and I'm going to evaluate you on that.”

Pulisic showed up for three games in the fall. But he struggled in two and has missed eight so far this year. His absence, and every subsequent comment, stoked a saga that will return to the fore next week when Pochettino names his roster for September's home friendlies against South Korea and Japan.

The force of the backlash likely “surprised” Pulisic, Sarachan says. Pulisic himself, speaking in his docuseries about the criticism from former players, was more blunt: “It sucks.”

He also reiterated a point he'll hope to back up over the next 11 months. “Come after my performance, whatever you want to say, but to talk about my commitment, the commitment that I've given to this game, that I've given to my national team for 10 years — that's the only thing that starts to get on my nerves,” Pulisic said. “But to be honest, it just fuels me to get back on the field, and shut everyone up, and show everyone what I'm about.”

Hello! Can Christian Pulisic and the USMNT fraternity kiss and make up? We're digging into his psyche today. On the way…

🧠 What makes Pulisic tick?

🤯 Miami's crazy quarter-final

🔀 Arsenal ambush Tottenham

🧤 Keeper's last-gasp equaliser

Mauricio Pochettino's next USMNT squad is nigh, and it is odds-on on Christian Pulisic will be in it. The summer is done. Milan and Pulisic start their Serie A season on Saturday. Last weekend, in the first round of the Coppa Italia, the forward was back to scoring goals.

Advertisement

For the best part of a decade, international call-ups for Pulisic have been taken as read, or worthy of very little analysis. He's Captain America, the USMNT's top boy and the asset every U.S. head coach would want to keep sweet. Or every U.S. head coach until now.

Don't get me wrong: deep down, Pochettino must know on which side his bread is buttered. He has few players as capable as Pulisic at his fingertips, but the fallout from the recent Concacaf Gold Cup — Pulisic backing out of it, Pochettino's terse reaction to that, the running verbal battle between today's superstar and USMNT alumni — has dragged the 26-year-old into disrepute and the realms of reputational management.

Driven by this, The Athletic's Henry Bushnell tracked down a few of Pulisic's former USMNT coaches — Bruce Arena, Dave Sarachan and Gregg Berhalter — to ask what the forward is really like. And by ‘really like', we're talking his levels of commitment to the U.S. cause, because after his Gold Cup absence, that's what is under the microscope.

You can gauge as much from the extent to which Pulisic's former managers speak about his devotion to international football. It's the underlying theme of Henry's article.

Arena's response to criticism of the forward is to say: “I don't buy it.” Sarachan was aware of Pulisic prioritising club football in certain moments, but you only have to look at the sheer amount of minutes demanded of him by Milan last season to appreciate why. “I know his love for his country,” Sarachan says. “He'll be there when it counts.” Berhalter calls the current furore “nonsense”.

Pulisic has been central to the plot of the USMNT for so long that it's easy to mistake him for a man in his 30s. In fact, he turns 27 in a month, which isn't exactly old in footballing years. He's the constant prime focus of attention for a country which, to be brutally honest, aspires to achievements in men's soccer beyond its current capabilities.

That's not to say better days won't come, but the U.S. men routinely fall short of shaking up the international scene. The past 18 months in particular — comprising Copa America, Concacaf Nations League and Gold Cup failures — have driven patience and tempers to the edge.

Which, in reality, is why pressure on players such as Pulisic is mounting — and why U.S. Soccer's substantial investment in Pochettino has to work. There's no time like the present for the Argentine coach. The 2026 World Cup, largely on United States soil, is coming his way… fast. He clearly didn't appreciate Pulisic missing the Gold Cup, but Pulisic sounded like a man who was ready for a rest, physically and emotionally.

Next up for the U.S. are home friendlies against South Korea and Japan, scheduled for the second week of September. We should get Pochettino's roster for those games next week and this time, there's no reason for Pulisic to be missing. The cycle of Captain America being asked to carry the nation's hopes and dreams starts again. Perhaps, in the grand scheme, it's sometimes asking too much.

If Pulisic doesn't count as old — for a footballer at least — the cap fits USMNT colleague Tim Ream. He's 38 in October but ploughing on for club and country, cut from the cloth of hardened players who only give in to retirement when their legs have well and truly ‘gone'.

Adam Crafton met up with him to review Ream's many years of service. This is a defender, don't forget, who Pep Guardiola once said he'd love to sign… if only Ream hadn't been 34 at the time. There's a funny story in Adam's piece about him man-marking Yaya Toure, the ex-Manchester City midfielder, to the point of distraction. “Would you just play football?” Toure begged of him.

Ream doesn't hold back in assessing the state of the USMNT. He admits openly that at various points recently, they have been “pushovers”. “That's something we had to rebuild and rectify,” he said. Honesty like that is why at next year's World Cup, Pochettino needs Ream's voice in the camp — and, most likely, his aging legs on the pitch.

Great fun down in the UK's capital city, where the north London derby kicked off early. Tottenham Hotspur don't go to the Emirates until November, but already, it's looking like 1-0 to the Arsenal.

On Wednesday morning, Spurs thought they were closing in on Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze. They were just about there in agreeing terms, with both Palace and the England midfielder. Then, without warning, David Ornstein appeared through the mist (the guy's forever doing that) to break the news that Arsenal were steaming in with a rival offer.

Their blindside bid was prompted by a knee injury to forward Kai Havertz, who looks like being absent for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately for Spurs, Eze is a boyhood Arsenal fan and was once in their youth system. He didn't need to think twice about who he was picking. A high-calibre attacker with some trolling of your arch-rivals thrown into the bargain? You'd have to call it Arsenal's perfect signing.



TAFC reader Rachel Searcy got in touch to rap our knuckles for failing to reference the 99th-minute equaliser scored by Chicago Stars' Alyssa Naeher in the NWSL on Monday night.

And our hands are up, because goals from goalkeepers only materialise once in an eternity. This, above, was the first of Naeher's career on her 200th NWSL outing, pilfering a 3-3 draw (from three down, on the road) against Seattle Reign.

The flip side of the coin? She scrambled the ball in just as her Seattle counterpart, Claudia Dickey, was about to write home about the best save she'd ever made. He giveth, he taketh away.

This article is part of our My Game In My Words 2025 series, an exclusive set of interviews with USMNT players where they talk us through how they do what they do on a soccer pitch.

Tim Ream turns 38 in October but remains an integral part of the United States men's national team. He played every minute across all six matches, and captained his country to the final, at the Concacaf Gold Cup this summer.

Ream, now at Charlotte FC in MLS after 12 years in England's Premier League and second-tier Championship with Bolton Wanderers and Fulham, says he does not play any differently when wearing the armband. “I'm not rah-rah-rah, lighting a fire under people,” he says of his captaincy style. “It's more a calmness, leading by example.”

He smiles wryly when asked if the Gold Cup felt enjoyable, given the high-profile absentees from the United States squad and criticism by former USMNT players.

“People can talk about the other ‘stuff,'” says Ream. “But we had a job to do. It was my most enjoyable Gold Cup, because of what the group stood for and what we built; supporting each other, becoming closer than any of us expected, really showing every single player cared, wanted to be there and had something to prove.”

Now they must replicate the spirit when bigger names return as next year's World Cup, co-hosted with Canada and Mexico but with the bulk of the matches on U.S. soil, edges closer.

“Whoever comes in, no matter who they are, what we did on the field, especially in that Costa Rica game (in the Gold Cup quarterfinals, drawing 2-2 before winning on penalties), that has to be the minimum. We can't go back to being pushovers.”

Pushovers is a strong term, no? “But we were in a lot of moments; in Copa América, in Nations League,” says Ream. “That's something we had to rebuild and rectify. The Gold Cup is different opponents, but you have to start somewhere and carry it on.”

And what about that World Cup next June and July? Has U.S. head coach Mauricio Pochettino talked to Ream about his plans for him in 2026?

“No,” the defender says. “I'm going to keep pushing and be ready for any role; starting, coming off the bench, or being the old guy in the corner with the orange slices and team talks. I continue to push because I care and want to be there. That's not solely down to me. You can do all those things and still not be picked. It's a huge honor whenever you get the call to come in. It's not one I'll be turning down.”

For a sense of Ream's longevity, consider his primary experiences in English football.

His first start after joining Bolton? Lining up against Harry Kane, when England's future record goalscorer and captain was a teenager on loan from Tottenham Hotspur to Millwall in the second tier. In Ream's first three months in England, he came up against forwards including Didier Drogba, Bobby Zamora, Yakubu, Emmanuel Adebayor, Emile Heskey and Peter Crouch; names now from a different era.

In his second Premier League game, his task was unforgiving: playing out of position in central midfield away to title-bound Manchester City, and man-marking their talisman, Yaya Touré.

“I got told to run around and chase Yaya,” he laughs. “That was not my finest moment. I remember him saying, ‘Would you just play football instead of following me around?' I said: ‘This is just what I got told to do. It's not my idea of fun either.'”

Ream clocked up almost 400 games in English football, and has played 75 senior internationals for his country. In the fall of 2022, a period the St. Louis native considers the finest of his career, he was approached by Pep Guardiola in the tunnel after a game. The City manager told Ream he had been so impressed by his performance that, had he been 24 years old rather than 34, he would want to sign him.

Sadly, The Athletic's back catalogue does not extend to his first Premier League experiences over 12 years ago, but there were no shortage of clips demonstrating the qualities that impressed Guardiola and continue to convince Pochettino to pick him at age 37.

This is Tim Ream's My Game in My Words.

“It's such an eye test now,” Ream muses. “When clubs think about center-backs, stats and data do not translate. If you are top for tackles, you are either doing something else wrong or someone in front of you is doing something wrong. How do you quantify a center-back being in the right position?”

In central defence, it's positioning, timing and anticipation that are key. So too are communication and awareness. Ream started out as a left-winger before also being played in central midfield and at left-back. He still remembers how it felt to receive the ball in different scenarios. He factors this in when weighting passes to teammates.

As a child with a local team in the Midwestern state of Missouri, Ream often trained inside “warehouses on concrete floors in the winter.”

He says: “We played with regular size-four and size-five balls. You had to understand technique to keep them on the ground. It was too cold and wet (to use ordinary fields). We used tennis courts. The older I've gotten, the more I think it was intentional, in terms of working small spaces — the lines were drawn out on tennis courts.”

This developed Ream's passing, and he worked to improve his weaker right foot. How? “By using it,” he shrugs.

“You unbalance opponents when you play off both feet. It frustrates me when players do not do that, because I can put them in a better position if I can play to either foot. I've not heard a player say: ‘I can't do it,' but I've heard them say: ‘I won't.'”

He sought improvement.

“I never felt I was one of the better players on my teams. It kept my feet on the ground. I knew I was good with the ball. I had conversations with university coaches (Ream went to Saint Louis University) about one-v-one defending, body position and understanding when you have to be more clever than physical.”

As an American child in the 1990s, TV access to global soccer was rare. Ream had few heroes to emulate. His first exposure to the sport's elite was via VHS tapes played by his teams' coaches on bus trips to away games, often recordings of matches from past World Cups.

Defensive instincts developed.

Take this moment from Fulham's Premier League home game against Luton Town in September 2023, where he steps into midfield to anticipate danger and break up a potential counter-attack.

In the first image below, Ream is not in view (he is just beyond the end of the white arrow in the centre circle) but can see a threat developing as Fulham's two midfielders (highlighted in blue) are at risk of being taken out by a clipped pass from their right side.



Ream takes up the story: “The Luton player takes a touch. The only place I think is dangerous is the little clipped ball. I'm looking at the player on the ball, but not at the ball. I'm looking at where our guys are set up and the Luton central midfielder running forward by himself. He (the man in possession) puts his head down before passing it, which means he's going to clip it in there. Then it's just a matter of reading the flight and getting there first. It's anticipation.”





A similar example is seen in a 3-0 victory for Fulham at Crystal Palace the previous December.

On this occasion, the ball runs loose in midfield and Ream needs to make an instant decision on whether to step up and try to win a challenge or drop off into defence. Wilfried Zaha, one of Palace's two onrushing forwards, chooses to run beyond the Fulham defence, hoping team-mate Jordan Ayew gets there before Ream and pokes a pass through to him.





“I am not favorite (to get the ball),” Ream says. “But ‘Jedi' (Fulham's USMNT left-back Antonee Robinson) is covering, and he's got pace to burn, (fellow center-back) Issa Diop is on his way back. Here I have to block-tackle, because I am in big trouble if I lunge. If my legs are open, Ayew can do a nutmeg through to Zaha.

“Jedi and I have played together for so long for club and country. With our communication and understanding, and knowing his physical attributes, it helps my decision-making.”



“Those are the millisecond decisions you have to make. Jedi gives me a security blanket to do what I did. Stuart Gray was a coach at Fulham. He told me you should come off the field and feel mentally more exhausted than physically, if not equally. We talked constantly about being switched on and tuned in.”

During that victory at Selhurst Park, Ream also scored his first Premier League goal. But doing so was not the highlight of his day. Instead, that came in the 68th minute, when Palace were on the counter-attack and Michael Olise, now of Bayern Munich, was bearing down on him.

What goes through Ream's mind here? “I know he wants to come inside,” he says. “I know he's left-footed, and I also know he can definitely outpace me. But actually, you will see I am not even looking at him. I'm looking backwards, at where my help is, to inform my decisions.”



Ream knows he needs to hold Olise up until more white Fulham shirts can get back to offer defensive support.

“As we drop towards our goal, I'm no longer running straight backwards. My footwork changes. Now it is crossover steps. I plant here and come back at an angle because I am saying: ‘OK, I'm not going to let you cut inside until my help fully arrives.'



“But now we are getting into the box. Dangerous territory. If you lunge, you risk taking him down.”



He pauses: “In all honesty, this is the most calm I've been in the entire game — and the most excited. My steps have changed again. I want him to go down the line but know he's good enough to still come inside. But I know my help is much closer. So he's going to have to put it through a really tight area.

“Top attackers have this thing in the box where if they think they get a half a step, they're not taking another touch. They're going to open themselves up and hit it first time. But he's left enough of the ball there in front of him so I know if I lunge or reach, I'm not going to take him down.”

Ream ends up getting in the way of Olise's attempt at goal: “I was more excited about blocking the shot than scoring because I read the situation, which was key at 1-0 up.”



For Ream, soccer remains a fusion of the psychological and the physical.

Two separate clips, from 12 years apart, demonstrate Ream's reading of the game and his ability to put his body on the line.

While playing for New York Red Bulls against LA Galaxy in May 2011 before ever moving to England, Ream responded superbly to a ball clipped over the top by David Beckham for Landon Donovan, scrambling all the way back to his goal line to hook it clear.



“I knew it wasn't an easy ball to control,” Ream says. “I know the ball is played with backspin, so it's going to check back, which gives me a chance. The 'keeper is coming out, so Landon can't go straight to goal. He's right-footed but the ball is bouncing away onto his left. If he plays this with his left foot, then I don't make it. End of story. Before games, I always check which foot my opponents prefer.

“The next thing which helps me is his connection with the outside of his foot is very poor. I go up a gear as soon as he touches it. It helps because the way he's hit it, it's bouncing, but I have to get around it and scoop it.”

In his years with Fulham and still with the USMNT, it is not only Ream's composure that stands out to fans. It is also commitment, exemplified by a clip here where he loses possession but immediately battles to win it back.

“Why give up?” he says. “‘OK, I've slipped. I need to react.' Sport is still about that. Who's hungry? Who wants it more? Who's going to fall down and get up again? That is non-negotiable.”

Ream needed all that spirit after he slipped a disc in his back in 2018, just after he entered his 30s.

“At 30, you think: ‘Is this the beginning of the end?' I had no feeling in my right leg for a few days. I had to have an injection and put everything right. I had to relearn to walk, or I wasn't walking correctly, because I couldn't feel anything. I had to strengthen everything: quad, glutes, calf, ankle. I re-learned to jump, hop and stabilize everything. It took me probably nine to 10 weeks.

“Even now, gym sessions are difficult. I can't load much onto my back; it is free weights and dumbbells, but I can't be doing heavy lifting anymore. I got into pilates.”

He recovered sufficiently to play in the 2022 World Cup, and early the following year he was providing goal-line stops once more, this time against Chelsea. When David Fofana breaks clear and goalkeeper Bernd Leno is exposed, Ream needs to make a decision. Rather than follow Fofana, he heads for the Fulham penalty area.



“His touch is going on the outside,” Ream says. “Now, I know Issa well enough that he's going to fully commit, even though he doesn't have to.”



Diop slides across, but Fofana is by now past Leno and cuts inside Ream's fellow defender: “I slow down, just as he gets in the space.



“I've arced my run and said: ‘OK, I dare you to put it on the ground and beat me at the near post.' I've thought: ‘If he chips it, well done.' But I'm going to try to bait him into putting it there.”

It works, Ream makes the clearance and Fulham go on to secure a 0-0 away draw.

Even at almost 38, Ream's ambition is undimmed. He continues to learn, saying he can improve his aerial duels. He says the Championship taught him “mentally how to grind out an entire season” and the Premier League “how to reduce my mistakes, limit space, and be a really good teammate.”

Ream describes walking out to play in that 2022 World Cup as the “culmination” of his career's efforts.

He may do it all over again next summer.

Welcome back to World Cup Countdown—The Ringer's monthly column previewing the 2026 World Cup hosted in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Each month, we'll be covering everything shaping the tournament, from the U.S. men's national team to the stars and story lines abroad that will define qualifying and the buildup to the opening match. Here's where we stand 294 days before kickoff. 

Over the past weekend, three of Europe's top five leagues (the Premier League, La Liga, and Ligue 1) kicked off their 2025-26 seasons. Here's what we have our eyes on as club football returns.

France manager Didier Deschamps often likes to stick with the players he trusts the most. He persisted with Olivier Giroud at striker and N'Golo Kanté as a defensive midfielder even after both were past their primes. He also usually defaults toward more defensive setups at tournaments, limiting the number of attacking personnel on the pitch. The reasoning makes sense: Pragmatism can win you matches in unpredictable tournament play. But the sheer volume of attacking talent in a potential France squad right now is genuinely bonkers.As if the firepower of Kylian Mbappé, Ousmane Dembélé, and Michael Olise wasn't enough, France has emerging superstars in Liverpool forward Hugo Ekitiké and Manchester City midfielder Rayan Cherki. Both scored in their Premier League debuts last weekend following breakout seasons last year at Eintracht Frankfurt and Lyon, respectively. Then there's Désiré Doué, who was man of the match in May's Champions League final. Deschamps's best talent skews toward the attacking end of the pitch, but his tactics do not. This dichotomy will be fascinating to watch because I'm expecting huge seasons from Cherki and Ekitiké at the club level, yet I'm not confident at all that Deschamps will be willing to turn the keys over to the next generation. The retirement of Antoine Griezmann last fall may end up forcing his hand, though. 

Cole Palmer has been one of the main story lines for two summers in a row now, for vastly different reasons. At Euro 2024, no one understood why Gareth Southgate couldn't shoehorn him into the starting lineup despite England's goal-scoring issues. Palmer didn't start a single match at that tournament, and many felt his talents were wasted—especially after he scored an equalizing goal in the final, which England went on to lose to Spain. Palmer followed the Euros with a great overall season at Chelsea, but it was an uneven campaign. He scored and assisted at a torrid pace in the first half, then struggled for goal contributions in the second half. Then, this summer, Palmer took off like a rocket and led Chelsea to a Club World Cup title. 

The England midfield remains crowded, with Jude Bellingham, Palmer, and Phil Foden all occupying similar spaces on the pitch. Add in how Harry Kane likes to drop deep and contribute to the buildup, and you have a lot of tactical dilemmas for Thomas Tuchel to solve right now. England shouldn't have issues qualifying, but Palmer's domestic form feels very important to him cementing his place in England's starting XI next summer. His lackluster showing in the opening match against Crystal Palace last weekend won't help his case. 

Since winning the Euros in 2021 and squeezing the last bit of production out of Ciro Immobile and Lorenzo Insigne, the Italian national team has really struggled to field consistent goal scorers. The ongoing battle for the starting striker position is between Al Qadsiah's Mateo Retegui and Fiorentina's Moise Kean. Based on age profiles (26 and 25, respectively), both should be in their primes right now, but neither has excelled for Italy. That means the door is open, and a 20-year-old could be the one to barge right through it. 

Francesco Pio Esposito scored 19 goals on loan at Spezia in Serie B last season. Now he's rejoined Inter and will compete for minutes with Marcus Thuram and Lautaro Martínez. After losing Romelu Lukaku to an injury last week, Napoli offered 45 million euros (roughly $53 million) for the striker, but Inter rejected the bid. It's clear that Inter believes in him, and he's a potential star in the making who could just solve the Italian national team's goal-scoring problem. 

The Biggest Question Facing Every 2025-26 Premier League Team

The Biggest Question Facing Every 2025-26 Premier League Team

The Biggest Question Facing Every 2025-26 Premier League Team

Belgium's plans of qualifying for the World Cup and succeeding in the tournament run through aging stars Romelu Lukaku and Kevin De Bruyne. The Belgium national team has talented, young attacking players like Malick Fofana (Lyon), Charles De Ketelaere (Atalanta), and Jérémy Doku (Manchester City), but it's still a Lukaku and De Bruyne operation first. Belgium fans had to be excited to see that the pair were teaming up under Antonio Conte at Napoli, but Lukaku's quad injury, which will leave him sidelined for three months, now leaves Belgium shorthanded. When you consider that De Bruyne made just 34 starts in the last two Premier League seasons combined, you have to wonder what the odds are that both will be healthy and in form next summer. 

Belgium plays Kazakhstan and Liechtenstein in the September qualifying matches and shouldn't have many issues there, but this injury to Lukaku raises an orange flag for them in the longer term. 

At the moment, it feels like Portugal is one of the most unsettled attacking groups of the 2026 World Cup favorites due to the inconsistent playing time of Goncalo Ramos at PSG and the age of Cristiano Ronaldo—not to mention the shock of Diogo Jota's tragic and sudden death. Ramos wasn't a member of PSG's starting XI for its biggest matches last year once Dembelé became the main striker. Ronaldo started up top in the Nations League semifinal and final in June (which Portugal won), but we've also seen Portugal's overreliance on Ronaldo bite the team at Euro 2024, where he failed to score. Portugal has as much depth as anyone in its midfield and wide forward ranks thanks to Bruno Fernandes, Pedro Neto, Rafael Leão, Francisco Conceicao, Bernardo Silva, and more, but the striker position remains a big question mark. Roberto Martínez seems to prefer Ronaldo as his main striker, but it's not clear how many minutes the 40-year-old will have left in his legs next summer.

This section focuses on the United States men's national team as it prepares to host the World Cup. 

You can debate the fairness of Christian Pulisic's and Tim Weah's recent digs at former U.S. players who've been critical of this generation. It's a familiar sports cycle when ex-players knock the new era to elevate their own accomplishments. But it's clear the optics are bad. 

Just months after skipping this summer's Gold Cup—the last competitive tournament the U.S. will play in before the World Cup—Pulisic is publicly pushing back. The USMNT star man dismissed the commentary from the likes of Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey as a “cop-out,” while Weah accused former players of “chasing checks.”

The so-called “golden generation” of U.S. talent, once bursting with promise, has felt stale and stagnant since the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. That stagnation has opened the door for former players to question their passion and motivation. Instead of downplaying that criticism, Pulisic and Weah have only inflamed the tensions.

Pulisic, who spent most of his career shying away from the spotlight, is now in the hot seat. The pressure on “Captain America” has never been higher. Next month's friendlies against South Korea and Japan won't make or break anything, but strong performances could go a long way toward steadying the narrative.

In terms of the rest of the USMNT, it's been a bit of a busy summer in the transfer market:

USMNT Notable Summer Transfers:

Tim Weah from Juventus to Marseille Matt Turner from Nottingham Forest to Lyon and then loaned to New England RevolutionJohnny Cardoso from Real Betis to Atlético MadridPatrick Agyemang from Charlotte to Derby CountyMalik Tillman from PSV to Bayer Leverkusen

So far this summer, five players in serious contention to start and play for the USMNT next year have moved clubs. The main notable absence from this list is Dortmund midfielder Giovanni Reyna. He is reportedly closing in on a move to Serie A club Parma, but there's nothing definitive there yet. 

For Cardoso and Tillman, the arrow is pointing directly upward, as both are moving into important roles at bigger clubs. Cardoso is joining a rebuilt Atlético Madrid midfield that is replacing Rodrigo De Paul and likely phasing out 33-year-old Koke. Cardoso's defensive skills will be required and tested in Diego Simeone's counterattacking system. 

Tillman is stepping into a Leverkusen team with a new manager (Erik ten Hag) and a roster that lost most of its key contributors from last season. Tillman is filling the Florian Wirtz hole in the lineup, and Tillman does bring the pressing ability and out-of-possession energy that ten Hag loves. I'll be looking to see how his attacking production translates from the Eredivisie to the Bundesliga, as replacing Wirtz—who had 44 goal contributions in two Bundesliga seasons and moved to Liverpool for a record fee this summer—will be a difficult task. 

Weah moves from a mess of a Juventus squad to an intriguing Marseille one that has Champions League football on offer. Roberto De Zerbi may be a questionable man manager, but one thing he's certainly willing to do is play high-octane attacking football. His Brighton finished second in expected goals in 2022-23, and Marseille was second in goals scored last year in Ligue 1. 

Turner will finally get to play major minutes again, the lack of which likely contributed to the decline in his shot-stopping ability last year. If Turner wants to be the no. 1 goalkeeper next summer, he has to play, even if it's at a lower level in MLS. Agyemang is unlikely to be a starter for the USMNT next summer, but he certainly has a chance of making the squad. Making the leap from MLS to Derby County in the Championship will present more of a challenge to his technical abilities this season. 

You could argue that the biggest USMNT-related transfer news is actually the departure of Dutch forward Luuk de Jong from PSV, which opens the door for Ricardo Pepi to be the main striker in Eindhoven. And don't sleep on fellow forward Josh Sargent, who's started the Championship season with two goals in two matches at Norwich. Will that be enough to get him back into the USMNT mix? We'll see.

This section focuses on the shifting fortunes of players, managers, and nations who could play a significant role next summer. 

So there's less than a year until the World Cup, right?

That was Richarlison's Instagram caption after scoring twice in Tottenham's Premier League opener, including a scissor kick that will easily be a contender for goal of the season. It was part flex, part cheeky reminder not to forget who carried Brazil's attack in Qatar.

Richarlison will try for another run as Brazil's leading man. Carlo Ancelotti has inherited a Brazil side still looking for a dependable striker, and Richarlison remains the best blend of tireless pressing, energetic movement, and the ability to produce a wondergoal. He led Brazil in goals at the last World Cup (three) and, if he can stay fit, may be their best bet to do it again.

His Spurs career has been a roller coaster due to injuries, but when Richarlison is actually on the field, he has been a reliable producer, with 13 goals in his last 16 Premier League starts. With less than 10 months until kickoff in North America, he just might be timing his run to perfection.

What Has Changed for Tottenham This Season?

It's only one match into the new season, but Vini Jr.'s muted showing in Real Madrid's opener against Osasuna felt like a continuation of last spring's dip. One shot, one successful dribble out of five, and one foul drawn: hardly the numbers of a player who, just a year ago, nearly won the Ballon d'Or.

Back then, Vini Jr. was on the path to becoming maybe the best wide forward in the world. Now? He finished this past season with disappointing Champions League knockout performances, and the questions have only grown since. The most telling sign came not in Madrid but in Brazil, where Ancelotti, who knows him better than anyone, chose not to call him up for September qualifiers. Maybe it's just for rest. (Vincius is also suspended for the first game against Chile due to accumulating too many yellow cards.)  Or maybe it's a message.

Brazil desperately needs a world-class leader heading into 2026, and the two most obvious candidates are Neymar and Vinícius. At the moment, both feel uncertain. For Brazil, that's a problem. 

It almost feels unfair to say their stock is still rising, but Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams look determined to push it higher anyway. They reached superstar levels at Euro 2024 when they carried Spain to a continental title, and early investors in both have only seen their returns grow. 

Williams was the man of the match in Athletic Club's 3-2 win over Sevilla this past weekend, with a goal, an assist, and seven successful dribbles. Yamal received the same honor in Barcelona's 3-0 win over Mallorca, racking up four shots on target, six completed dribbles, a goal, and an assist.

Spain already knew it had a superstar duo. Now, it's just a question of how high their ceiling can go before the World Cup kicks off. 

The opening weekend of the Premier League featured one Swedish striker who was sorely missed and another who made a bad first impression at his new club. 

Newcastle's attack looked lost without the services of Alexander Isak, who has now publicly declared that he has “lost trust” in Newcastle and that the relationship between them “can't continue.” Numerous sources are reporting that Isak is desperate for a move to Liverpool. The Magpies, however, don't want to sell their best player, so the two sides could be entering a game of chicken as the transfer deadline nears. Isak probably won't feature for Newcastle prior to the international break at the end of August, which could be costly since Sweden faces must-win road games at Kosovo and Slovenia in September, and Isak could be lacking match fitness at that point. 

🚨⚠️ BREAKING! Alexander Isak releases statement: “When promises are broken and trust is lost, the relationship can't continue”.“I'm proud to be recognised by my fellow professionals with a place in the PFA Premier League Team of the Season for 2024/25.First and foremost I… pic.twitter.com/hLr9xGUsLk

Meanwhile, Viktor Gyokeres's debut for Arsenal went about as poorly as possible in the Gunners' 1-0 win against Manchester United. Gyokeres finished with no shots and just three box touches, and he looked ineffective in duels. Drawing conclusions from one match would be silly, but it was a concerning debut. Sweden relies heavily on those two forwards and the currently injured midfielder Dejan Kulusevski for goals. If they aren't fit and firing, that could make qualifying even more difficult.

Each month, the World Cup Countdown selection committee (me) will highlight some of the best, worst, and strangest moments in the sport.

The brevity was the point. In just 10 words and three questions—“Can you tell us how he died, where, and why?”—Mo Salah managed to highlight exactly what UEFA's “tribute” to Palestinian player Suleiman Obeid left unsaid. Salah's post cut straight through the silence and forced everyone reading it to confront the omissions.

Can you tell us how he died, where, and why? https://t.co/W7HCyVVtBE

Obeid, nicknamed the “Palestinian Pelé,” was one of the greatest players in his nation's history. He was reportedly killed in Gaza by munitions dropped from an Israeli quadcopter while he was waiting in line for humanitarian aid. He was a father of five just trying to provide for his family.

UEFA later displayed a banner at the Super Cup between PSG and Spurs that read: “Stop killing children. Stop killing civilians.” But it was Salah's tweet that carried the most weight and reached tens of millions. 

New Zealand is famous for its vibrant wines, but none are aging more gracefully than the national team's 33-year-old striker.

On our preseason preview podcast, I pointed out how often Nottingham Forest went up 1-0 early in matches last season, how Wood massively overperformed his expected goals, and how both were bound to regress. Naturally, five minutes into the new season, Wood scored to put Forest up 1-0 on Brentford, and they cruised to a 3-1 win.

New Zealand isn't likely to escape its World Cup group next summer, but Wood's game still feels tailor-made for the international stage. His holdup play, aerial presence, clever runs in behind, and efficiency in transition are perpetually underrated. He's enjoying the finest form of his career, and if he can bottle this version of himself, he could be the key to New Zealand pulling off a shock or two in North America.

We're just a few weeks away from the first international break of the new club season, and that means World Cup qualifying will continue across four of the six confederations beginning on September 4. Here are three main storylines I'm following in the upcoming window. 

On paper, Senegal, Nigeria, and Cameroon are three of the best teams in Africa. All three were the top-seeded team in their respective qualifying groups, yet none are currently in first place with four matches to play. In Africa's unforgiving format, only the nine group winners punch a direct ticket to the World Cup, leaving anyone who slips to second facing a brutal playoff path.

In Group B, Senegal trail DR Congo by a single point ahead of their September 9 road trip. Senegal is currently unbeaten, but with just eight goals—four of which came in a match against South Sudan—in six matches, their attack has sputtered. They managed only a 1-1 draw at home against DR Congo in the first meeting, and the rematch now looms as the group's inflection point, with the winner heavily favored to finish on top. 

Cameroon find themselves in a nearly identical spot, one point back of surprise leaders Cape Verde. Fresh off an AFCON quarterfinal run that included a win over Ghana, Cape Verde now hosts Cameroon on September 9. Whoever comes out on top will seize control of the group.

Nigeria's path is considerably more precarious. The Super Eagles have just one win in six matches, sit in fourth place, and trail leaders South Africa by six points. Nigeria plays second-place Rwanda on September 6 and then visits South Africa on September 9. Anything less than two wins could leave Nigeria's World Cup hopes on life support.

CONMEBOL will be the second confederation, after tiny Oceania, to complete its qualifying process next month. Ecuador, Brazil, and Argentina have already clinched their spots, and Uruguay and Paraguay are near certain to qualify as they each need just one more point from two matches.

With Chile already eliminated and Peru's chances at almost zero, three teams are left fighting for the final 1.5 spots. Sixth place qualifies directly, while seventh heads to the intercontinental playoff. Right now, Colombia sits sixth and Venezuela seventh, with Bolivia just behind. And because Colombia plays both of their direct rivals in the final window, there could be plenty of drama on September 4 and September 9.

Here are the remaining fixtures:

Colombia—Bolivia (H), Venezuela (A)Venezuela—Argentina (A), Colombia (H)Bolivia—Colombia (A), Brazil (H)

Colombia should be able to take care of business against Bolivia, who struggles away from home. But if the Colombians drop points, their World Cup qualifying status could come down to a difficult away trip to Venezuela on the final day.  

Because Spain, Germany, France, and Portugal were in the Nations League semifinals and finals in June, none have begun their World Cup qualifying campaigns yet. Europe has a quick qualifying process for these top teams, who will only need to play six total matches across the next three windows.

Here are the highest-profile matches in September to mark your calendars

September 4—Slovakia vs. GermanySeptember 5—Ukraine vs. FranceSeptember 7—Turkey vs. SpainSeptember 9—Hungary vs. PortugalSeptember 9—Serbia vs. England 

All four of the European giants who start their qualifying campaigns in September begin play with the second-best team in their group away from home. Securing a win in that match would leave them as overwhelming favorites to qualify.

ExplainSpeaking: How Trump's tariffs are hurting the US economy

The President of the United States, regularly referred to by the acronym POTUS, is often called the most powerful person in the world. And the present resident of the White House is also one of the richest. But does that explain Donald Trump possessing a trophy that neither he, nor any American sportsperson or team, has won?

When the White House recently posted a picture of Trump with some other world leaders at his official residence, some sharp football fans noticed something they didn't expect to find at the Oval Office – the FIFA Club World Cup trophy.



Premier League outfit Chelsea clinched the silverware last month, beating UEFA Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain in the final in New Jersey. But there it was, occupying pride of place at the office of the US president.

When asked about it, Trump said he had been told he could keep it, in recognition of the United States hosting the month-long tournament. It was Trump who handed over the trophy to the tournament winners at the post-match ceremony, and remained on the podium for some time afterwards before being asked to step backstage by FIFA president Giovanni Infantino.

“I said, ‘When are you going to pick up the trophy?' [They said] ‘We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office, we're making a new one',” Trump was quoted as saying in an interview with DAZN.

“And they actually made a new one. So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval [Office] right now.”

But football's world governing body cleared the air on any confusion, informing that there are in fact three Club World Club trophies in existence.

The original engraved version resides at the FIFA headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. All original trophies – including the FIFA World Cup – stay there.

Winners of every FIFA tournament get a replica to keep and showcase. Chelsea paraded their trophy during their pre-season friendly against AC Milan.

There's a third version that resides at the Oval Office of the White House, in “recognition of the 2025 tournament's exceptional hosts”, FIFA was quoted as saying by BBC Sport.

The Club World Cup was held across 11 cities in the United States, but there was criticism over low attendances, high temperatures and poor quality of playing surfaces.

It was considered a sort of dress rehearsal for next year's 48-team FIFA World Cup which the US will co-host along with Canada and Mexico.

Why ‘Chelsea's Trophy' is in the US President's Office

Football fans pride themselves on spotting details others may miss. So when the White House shared a photograph this week of President Donald Trump meeting with world leaders in the Oval Office, eagle-eyed supporters quickly noticed something unusual. Among the flags, portraits, and presidential papers stood a glittering piece of silverware: the FIFA Club World Cup trophy.

The sight raised eyebrows across social media. Why was a trophy Chelsea won just weeks ago at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium sitting in the most powerful office in the world? Was the president borrowing it for decoration? Or had Chelsea forgotten to pick it up? The answer, as it turns out, is more complicated—and more symbolic—than it first appears.

The Trophy That Caught the World's Attention

In July, Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final, a game that crowned them the best club team in world football. Supporters celebrated, Enzo Maresca's men lifted the trophy, and it seemed the silverware would return to Stamford Bridge alongside the club's other European honour's.

But soon after, football fans noticed the trophy reappearing in an unexpected setting—on the president's desk in Washington D.C. The curiosity quickly went viral, sparking a mix of amusement, outrage, and intrigue among Chelsea supporters and neutrals alike.

Trump's Version of Events

President Trump himself explained the situation in an interview with DAZN. According to him, organisers of the tournament told him he could keep the trophy permanently in recognition of the United States hosting the month-long competition.

“I said, ‘When are you going to pick up the trophy?'” Trump recalled. “They said, ‘We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office, we're making a new one.' And they actually made a new one. So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval right now.”

His words suggested that Chelsea might have been left without their hard-won prize. But FIFA was quick to set the record straight.

FIFA Clarifies: Three Trophies, Three Stories

In reality, there are three versions of the Club World Cup trophy, each with its own story and home:

Football, Politics, and Symbolism

While the clarification clears up the confusion, the image of the Club World Cup trophy in the Oval Office has taken on symbolic weight. For one, it reflects the United States' growing role in world football. With the country set to co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup alongside Canada and Mexico, and having just staged the 2025 Club World Cup, America is becoming an increasingly central stage for the sport.

Keeping a version of the trophy in the Oval Office signals not only appreciation for hosting duties but also recognition of football's expanding influence in U.S. culture. For years, the sport trailed behind American football, basketball, and baseball. But with the influx of international stars in Major League Soccer and high-profile tournaments held on U.S. soil, the game's profile has never been higher.

Politically, the trophy also serves as a prop for Trump, whose image often thrives on spectacle and symbolism. Displaying global football's silverware on his desk presents the United States as not just a political superpower but a sporting one too.

The Fans' Reaction

Chelsea fans, unsurprisingly, reacted with a mix of pride and frustration. On the one hand, the presence of “their” trophy in the Oval Office highlights the club's global stature. On the other, many supporters feared the confusion might overshadow Chelsea's achievement.

Social media brimmed with memes and jokes, with one fan tweeting: “We waited all season for this, and Trump just nicked it for decoration!” Another quipped: “So Chelsea win the Club World Cup and somehow Trump wins the trophy—sounds about right.”

But FIFA's clarification that Chelsea owns its replica helped ease concerns. The version in the White House is not a replacement but rather a symbolic gesture tied to the host nation.

What It Means Going Forward

The saga of the Oval Office trophy highlights the sometimes murky relationship between sport, politics, and symbolism. Trophies are not just pieces of silverware; they carry narratives of triumph, identity, and pride. For Chelsea, the 2025 Club World Cup win will always belong to them, regardless of where other versions of the trophy reside.

For the United States, however, the Oval Office trophy underscores the nation's ambitions in global football. With major tournaments lined up and growing fan interest, the country is poised to play an even larger role in shaping the sport's future.

And for FIFA, the decision to create multiple versions of the trophy ensures that both winners and hosts share in the legacy of the competition.

Final Thoughts

The Oval Office trophy tale may have started as a quirky observation by football fans, but it quickly revealed deeper layers about sport, symbolism, and global influence. Chelsea's triumph is secure in history, their replica trophy proudly in London, yet the presence of another version in Washington speaks to football's growing power in the United States.

As the U.S. positions itself as a central hub for major tournaments, the image of the Club World Cup trophy beside the president's desk is more than decoration—it's a sign of football's expanding reach and its ability to transcend sport, weaving itself into politics, culture, and identity on the world stage.

Would you like me to keep the final thoughts short and punchy (almost like a takeaway line for readers), or slightly longer and reflective, tying back to Chelsea's win as well?

Conclusion

What began as a curious sighting in a White House photograph quickly evolved into a story about symbolism, identity, and football's global reach. Chelsea fans need not worry—their hard-earned Club World Cup trophy is safe in London. The version in the Oval Office is a separate token of recognition, honouring the United States as an exceptional host nation.

Ultimately, the image of the trophy in the president's office serves as a reminder of football's growing influence in America and its ability to connect politics, culture, and sport in surprising ways. In the end, “Chelsea's trophy” may not belong to Donald Trump—but it does tell a bigger story about where the beautiful game is headed.

The Club World Cup trophy verges on iconic. No, not the one handed to Chelsea in New Jersey after they beat Paris Saint-Germain in last month's final. The other one, sitting in the Oval Office, making memes every time it pops up during a major US presidential announcement or high-level meeting.

Just this week it cameoed in an urgent audience with Volodymyr Zelensky, this time flanked by several European allies, seeking an end to Russia's war in Ukraine. There it was, the extravagant Tiffany & Co collaboration inspired by NASA's missions into space, in the background of the most important gathering since Trump “made no deal until there's a deal” with Vladimir Putin in Alaska a few days ago.

The 24-carat gold-plated silverware, with its rotating discs and periodic table and astronomical maps, was hand-delivered to the White House in March by FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who created it and had his name engraved on it – twice. It is, according to FIFA, one of three existing trophies, along with the original version at FIFA headquarters in Zurich and the one now belonging to Chelsea.

Trump said he was told he could keep his, and the juxtaposition of a global crisis and a football trophy – along with a winner's medal, possibly meant for Noni Madueke (The Art of the Steal) – in the same room gives such Big Trump Energy it has fast become a source of comic relief. That's to go with last month's vainglorious pantomime at MetLife Stadium, where Trump presented Chelsea's trophy to Reece James then proceeded to remain on stage with the players for the traditional trophy lift as Infantino awkwardly attempted to manoeuvre him out of the limelight. Man of the match Cole Palmer admitted to being “a bit confused”.

It all makes it kind of difficult to take seriously the notion that this Disneyland of a reconstituted tournament could reportedly, after 2029, take place every two years instead of every four and feature 48 teams.

The relentlessly expansionist Infantino has been playing Honey, I Blew Up The Kid since the start of his tenure, and the 2026 men's World Cup and 2031 Women's World Cup will both involve 48 teams for the first time. His transformation of this year's Club World Cup to 32 teams – from the long-running and largely ignored seven-team format contested by six continental champions plus one host club – is keeping with this model, and the next step appears inevitable.

Staged as 63 games across 11 American cities, it was divisive. For the sparse crowds in cavernous NFL stadiums (over a million empty seats defied Infantino's prediction of “63 Super Bowls in one month”). For the extreme weather, the quality of pitches, the manufactured hype. The Saudi money. Player welfare concerns.

On the latter, Infantino has been the subject of intense hostility from domestic leagues and players' unions, to the point FIFA has been fighting legal fires over the world governing body's alleged “abuse of dominance” and lack of consultation when adding to an insanely congested international calendar.

This is understandable. A Europe-based player who participates in Euro 2024, the 2025 Club World Cup and the 2026 World Cup will effectively have zero rest for three straight off-seasons. There is no room to move, and how the Club World Cup affects the domestic season of Chelsea and PSG et al may yet be revealing. Then back into the oppressive North American summer heat they will go for a World Cup across three countries in the US, Canada, and Mexico. There's nothing like watching an injured player doing his best work.

“FIFA was put on earth really to regulate the global game and to run international football, and the Club World Cup is a move into club football,” Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said earlier this month. FIFPro president Sergio Marchi, meanwhile, labelled it “nothing more than a fiction created by FIFA” and its “grandiloquent staging inevitably reminiscent of the ‘bread and circuses' of Nero's Rome”.

There are so many more voices in this debate, but for the sake of brevity, let's stick with former Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp, who called it “the worst idea ever implemented in football in this regard”. Arsene Wenger, a vocal critic of fixture congestion throughout his previous role overseeing Arsenal, has now taken a “fantastic competition” view in his current capacity as FIFA's chief of global football development. “A real Club World Cup was needed,” said Wenger, who recently campaigned for a World Cup every two years.

He added that every club involved would favour this format moving forward – and of course they would when the prize fund is $US1 billion. Chelsea received an estimated $US114.6 million; it is little surprise other big European clubs would like a piece of the pie. Real Madrid's reported push for a biennial cycle is apparently supported by other clubs who failed to qualify for this year's tournament, including Barcelona, Manchester United, Liverpool and Napoli. The proposal for 48 teams fits that agenda given that, unless FIFA lifts its cap of 12 European entrants and two from each country, expansion is the only way to ensure more European clubs (notwithstanding other cross-continental quirks in the qualifying criteria).

But this tells us what the Club World Cup is not. It is not a bucket-list trophy like the World Cup or continental championships. The value is not in the prestige of the title. Had Inter Miami (demolished by PSG in the round of 16) won, Lionel Messi would not have retired any more contented for the privilege (he already has three of the old Club World Cups with Barcelona). There is no way he would have picked this space-age trophy over the World Cup he finally added to his otherwise complete CV in 2022.

That is not to say the football was bad. Despite the naf, corporate anti-culture, the actual football was quite good, headlined by novelty rivalries and upsets galore. Al Hilal knocked out Manchester City and Auckland City held Boca Juniors to a draw. Then there was the standout quality and colour of Brazilian sides Flamengo (beat Chelsea), Botafogo (beat PSG), Fluminense (beat Inter Milan and made the semi-finals) and Palmeiras (topped their group and made the quarters).

In this sense, the organisers were savvy, offering an extended hand to the peripheral or uninitiated football fan, and to America's diaspora who comprised a portion of these numbers (not that this was intended given the Trump administration's stance on diversity and immigration). It offered hope for the future of such an event, if treated more modestly.

But FIFA is nothing if not bloated, and the money speaks for itself: the revenue averaged out at $US33 million per match. At that rate, why not add even more games? The problem here is that the world governing body is failing to recognise the law of diminishing returns that are less tangible than cold, hard cash. All that money has cheapened the global football ecosystem, in a surreal sort of inflation that disrupts its delicate balance without actually distributing wealth in a more equitable way. Diluting the game's meaning without addressing the yawning gap between rich and poor.

BFFs: Gianni Infantino and Donald Trump with their wives at the Club World Cup final in New Jersey.Credit: AP

Infantino, presumably the Nero in Marchi's metaphor, nevertheless hailed his pet project as “a huge, huge, huge success” on the eve of the final. He did so from New York's Trump Tower, where FIFA has set up a base and where he refused to answer any questions regarding anything unrelated to the Club World Cup (like Saudi Arabia being awarded hosting rights to the 2034 World Cup) and even some things related to the Club World Cup (like Saudi's Surj Sports Investments largely bankrolling the tournament).

And so, once again, propaganda wins the day. Soft power and influence and sportswashing remain the modus operandi, and Trump's trophy will keep playing its geopolitical part from the Oval Office.

Infantino is somewhere up in space, mapping the approximate positions of planets at the time of FIFA's foundation in 1904 and the Club World Cup's opening match in 2025. Orbiting the earth in pursuit of celestial symbols to engrave on his trophy, just to give others the chance to “hold the world of club football in their hands”.

We can exclusively reveal that the Scotland 2026 away shirt will feature a never-seen-before main color: ‘Trace Scarlet', a coral-like shade that mixes red and orange.

If Scotland qualify, Scotland's new 2026 away kit will be worn at the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the USA, Mexico, and Canada. The Tartan Army last appeared at a World Cup back in 1998 in France.

Check out the colors of Adidas' Scotland 2026 away football shirt below.

The Adidas Scotland 2026 away football shirt will be predominantly Trace Scarlet, marking the first time in history that the Scottish national team adopts a coral-inspired tone as their main away color.

The closest precedent dates back to the 1999 Umbro away shirt, which also featured a similarly vibrant tone, though not as coral-like as the 2026 design.

The Adidas Originals Adventure T-shirt in the primary 'Trace Scarlet' color evokes the tone of Scotland's 2026 away kit.

Currently, there is no confirmation about the accent colors of the Adidas Scotland 2026 away jersey. Possible options include navy, Scotland's traditional home color, or white, which would also pair well with the coral base.

The Adidas Scotland 2026 away jersey will feature the Adidas Trefoil logo instead of the standard Adidas Performance branding, following Adidas' 2026 Trefoil away shirt strategy.

Welcome back to World Cup Countdown—The Ringer's monthly column previewing the 2026 World Cup hosted in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Each month, we'll be covering everything shaping the tournament, from the U.S. men's national team to the stars and story lines abroad that will define qualifying and the buildup to the opening match. Here's where we stand 294 days before kickoff. 

Over the past weekend, three of Europe's top five leagues (the Premier League, La Liga, and Ligue 1) kicked off their 2025-26 seasons. Here's what we have our eyes on as club football returns.

France manager Didier Deschamps often likes to stick with the players he trusts the most. He persisted with Olivier Giroud at striker and N'Golo Kanté as a defensive midfielder even after both were past their primes. He also usually defaults toward more defensive setups at tournaments, limiting the number of attacking personnel on the pitch. The reasoning makes sense: Pragmatism can win you matches in unpredictable tournament play. But the sheer volume of attacking talent in a potential France squad right now is genuinely bonkers.As if the firepower of Kylian Mbappé, Ousmane Dembélé, and Michael Olise wasn't enough, France has emerging superstars in Liverpool forward Hugo Ekitiké and Manchester City midfielder Rayan Cherki. Both scored in their Premier League debuts last weekend following breakout seasons last year at Eintracht Frankfurt and Lyon, respectively. Then there's Désiré Doué, who was man of the match in May's Champions League final. Deschamps's best talent skews toward the attacking end of the pitch, but his tactics do not. This dichotomy will be fascinating to watch because I'm expecting huge seasons from Cherki and Ekitiké at the club level, yet I'm not confident at all that Deschamps will be willing to turn the keys over to the next generation. The retirement of Antoine Griezmann last fall may end up forcing his hand, though. 

Cole Palmer has been one of the main story lines for two summers in a row now, for vastly different reasons. At Euro 2024, no one understood why Gareth Southgate couldn't shoehorn him into the starting lineup despite England's goal-scoring issues. Palmer didn't start a single match at that tournament, and many felt his talents were wasted—especially after he scored an equalizing goal in the final, which England went on to lose to Spain. Palmer followed the Euros with a great overall season at Chelsea, but it was an uneven campaign. He scored and assisted at a torrid pace in the first half, then struggled for goal contributions in the second half. Then, this summer, Palmer took off like a rocket and led Chelsea to a Club World Cup title. 

The England midfield remains crowded, with Jude Bellingham, Palmer, and Phil Foden all occupying similar spaces on the pitch. Add in how Harry Kane likes to drop deep and contribute to the buildup, and you have a lot of tactical dilemmas for Thomas Tuchel to solve right now. England shouldn't have issues qualifying, but Palmer's domestic form feels very important to him cementing his place in England's starting XI next summer. His lackluster showing in the opening match against Crystal Palace last weekend won't help his case. 

Since winning the Euros in 2021 and squeezing the last bit of production out of Ciro Immobile and Lorenzo Insigne, the Italian national team has really struggled to field consistent goal scorers. The ongoing battle for the starting striker position is between Al Qadsiah's Mateo Retegui and Fiorentina's Moise Kean. Based on age profiles (26 and 25, respectively), both should be in their primes right now, but neither has excelled for Italy. That means the door is open, and a 20-year-old could be the one to barge right through it. 

Francesco Pio Esposito scored 19 goals on loan at Spezia in Serie B last season. Now he's rejoined Inter and will compete for minutes with Marcus Thuram and Lautaro Martínez. After losing Romelu Lukaku to an injury last week, Napoli offered 45 million euros (roughly $53 million) for the striker, but Inter rejected the bid. It's clear that Inter believes in him, and he's a potential star in the making who could just solve the Italian national team's goal-scoring problem.

The Biggest Question Facing Every 2025-26 Premier League Team

Belgium's plans of qualifying for the World Cup and succeeding in the tournament run through aging stars Romelu Lukaku and Kevin De Bruyne. The Belgium national team has talented, young attacking players like Malick Fofana (Lyon), Charles De Ketelaere (Atalanta), and Jérémy Doku (Manchester City), but it's still a Lukaku and De Bruyne operation first. Belgium fans had to be excited to see that the pair were teaming up under Antonio Conte at Napoli, but Lukaku's quad injury, which will leave him sidelined for three months, now leaves Belgium shorthanded. When you consider that De Bruyne made just 34 starts in the last two Premier League seasons combined, you have to wonder what the odds are that both will be healthy and in form next summer. 

Belgium plays Kazakhstan and Liechtenstein in the September qualifying matches and shouldn't have many issues there, but this injury to Lukaku raises an orange flag for them in the longer term. 

At the moment, it feels like Portugal is one of the most unsettled attacking groups of the 2026 World Cup favorites due to the inconsistent playing time of Goncalo Ramos at PSG and the age of Cristiano Ronaldo—not to mention the shock of Diogo Jota's tragic and sudden death. Ramos wasn't a member of PSG's starting XI for its biggest matches last year once Dembelé became the main striker. Ronaldo started up top in the Nations League semifinal and final in June (which Portugal won), but we've also seen Portugal's overreliance on Ronaldo bite the team at Euro 2024, where he failed to score. Portugal has as much depth as anyone in its midfield and wide forward ranks thanks to Bruno Fernandes, Pedro Neto, Rafael Leão, Francisco Conceicao, Bernardo Silva, and more, but the striker position remains a big question mark. Roberto Martínez seems to prefer Ronaldo as his main striker, but it's not clear how many minutes the 40-year-old will have left in his legs next summer.

This section focuses on the United States men's national team as it prepares to host the World Cup. 

You can debate the fairness of Christian Pulisic's and Tim Weah's recent digs at former U.S. players who've been critical of this generation. It's a familiar sports cycle when ex-players knock the new era to elevate their own accomplishments. But it's clear the optics are bad. 

Just months after skipping this summer's Gold Cup—the last competitive tournament the U.S. will play in before the World Cup—Pulisic is publicly pushing back. The USMNT star man dismissed the commentary from the likes of Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey as a “cop-out,” while Weah accused former players of “chasing checks.”

The so-called “golden generation” of U.S. talent, once bursting with promise, has felt stale and stagnant since the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. That stagnation has opened the door for former players to question their passion and motivation. Instead of downplaying that criticism, Pulisic and Weah have only inflamed the tensions.

Pulisic, who spent most of his career shying away from the spotlight, is now in the hot seat. The pressure on “Captain America” has never been higher. Next month's friendlies against South Korea and Japan won't make or break anything, but strong performances could go a long way toward steadying the narrative.

In terms of the rest of the USMNT, it's been a bit of a busy summer in the transfer market:

USMNT Notable Summer Transfers:

Tim Weah from Juventus to Marseille Matt Turner from Nottingham Forest to Lyon and then loaned to New England RevolutionJohnny Cardoso from Real Betis to Atlético MadridPatrick Agyemang from Charlotte to Derby CountyMalik Tillman from PSV to Bayer Leverkusen

So far this summer, five players in serious contention to start and play for the USMNT next year have moved clubs. The main notable absence from this list is Dortmund midfielder Giovanni Reyna. He is reportedly closing in on a move to Serie A club Parma, but there's nothing definitive there yet. 

For Cardoso and Tillman, the arrow is pointing directly upward, as both are moving into important roles at bigger clubs. Cardoso is joining a rebuilt Atlético Madrid midfield that is replacing Rodrigo De Paul and likely phasing out 33-year-old Koke. Cardoso's defensive skills will be required and tested in Diego Simeone's counterattacking system. 

Tillman is stepping into a Leverkusen team with a new manager (Erik ten Hag) and a roster that lost most of its key contributors from last season. Tillman is filling the Florian Wirtz hole in the lineup, and Tillman does bring the pressing ability and out-of-possession energy that ten Hag loves. I'll be looking to see how his attacking production translates from the Eredivisie to the Bundesliga, as replacing Wirtz—who had 44 goal contributions in two Bundesliga seasons and moved to Liverpool for a record fee this summer—will be a difficult task. 

Weah moves from a mess of a Juventus squad to an intriguing Marseille one that has Champions League football on offer. Roberto De Zerbi may be a questionable man manager, but one thing he's certainly willing to do is play high-octane attacking football. His Brighton finished second in expected goals in 2022-23, and Marseille was second in goals scored last year in Ligue 1. 

Turner will finally get to play major minutes again, the lack of which likely contributed to the decline in his shot-stopping ability last year. If Turner wants to be the no. 1 goalkeeper next summer, he has to play, even if it's at a lower level in MLS. Agyemang is unlikely to be a starter for the USMNT next summer, but he certainly has a chance of making the squad. Making the leap from MLS to Derby County in the Championship will present more of a challenge to his technical abilities this season. 

You could argue that the biggest USMNT-related transfer news is actually the departure of Dutch forward Luuk de Jong from PSV, which opens the door for Ricardo Pepi to be the main striker in Eindhoven. And don't sleep on fellow forward Josh Sargent, who's started the Championship season with two goals in two matches at Norwich. Will that be enough to get him back into the USMNT mix? We'll see.

This section focuses on the shifting fortunes of players, managers, and nations who could play a significant role next summer. 

So there's less than a year until the World Cup, right?

That was Richarlison's Instagram caption after scoring twice in Tottenham's Premier League opener, including a scissor kick that will easily be a contender for goal of the season. It was part flex, part cheeky reminder not to forget who carried Brazil's attack in Qatar.

Richarlison will try for another run as Brazil's leading man. Carlo Ancelotti has inherited a Brazil side still looking for a dependable striker, and Richarlison remains the best blend of tireless pressing, energetic movement, and the ability to produce a wondergoal. He led Brazil in goals at the last World Cup (three) and, if he can stay fit, may be their best bet to do it again.

His Spurs career has been a roller coaster due to injuries, but when Richarlison is actually on the field, he has been a reliable producer, with 13 goals in his last 16 Premier League starts. With less than 10 months until kickoff in North America, he just might be timing his run to perfection.

What Has Changed for Tottenham This Season?

What Has Changed for Tottenham This Season?

It's only one match into the new season, but Vini Jr.'s muted showing in Real Madrid's opener against Osasuna felt like a continuation of last spring's dip. One shot, one successful dribble out of five, and one foul drawn: hardly the numbers of a player who, just a year ago, nearly won the Ballon d'Or.

Back then, Vini Jr. was on the path to becoming maybe the best wide forward in the world. Now? He finished this past season with disappointing Champions League knockout performances, and the questions have only grown since. The most telling sign came not in Madrid but in Brazil, where Ancelotti, who knows him better than anyone, chose not to call him up for September qualifiers. Maybe it's just for rest. (Vincius is also suspended for the first game against Chile due to accumulating too many yellow cards.)  Or maybe it's a message.

Brazil desperately needs a world-class leader heading into 2026, and the two most obvious candidates are Neymar and Vinícius. At the moment, both feel uncertain. For Brazil, that's a problem. 

It almost feels unfair to say their stock is still rising, but Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams look determined to push it higher anyway. They reached superstar levels at Euro 2024 when they carried Spain to a continental title, and early investors in both have only seen their returns grow. 

Williams was the man of the match in Athletic Club's 3-2 win over Sevilla this past weekend, with a goal, an assist, and seven successful dribbles. Yamal received the same honor in Barcelona's 3-0 win over Mallorca, racking up four shots on target, six completed dribbles, a goal, and an assist.

Spain already knew it had a superstar duo. Now, it's just a question of how high their ceiling can go before the World Cup kicks off. 

The opening weekend of the Premier League featured one Swedish striker who was sorely missed and another who made a bad first impression at his new club. 

Newcastle's attack looked lost without the services of Alexander Isak, who has now publicly declared that he has “lost trust” in Newcastle and that the relationship between them “can't continue.” Numerous sources are reporting that Isak is desperate for a move to Liverpool. The Magpies, however, don't want to sell their best player, so the two sides could be entering a game of chicken as the transfer deadline nears. Isak probably won't feature for Newcastle prior to the international break at the end of August, which could be costly since Sweden faces must-win road games at Kosovo and Slovenia in September, and Isak could be lacking match fitness at that point. 

🚨⚠️ BREAKING! Alexander Isak releases statement: “When promises are broken and trust is lost, the relationship can't continue”.“I'm proud to be recognised by my fellow professionals with a place in the PFA Premier League Team of the Season for 2024/25.First and foremost I… pic.twitter.com/hLr9xGUsLk

Meanwhile, Viktor Gyokeres's debut for Arsenal went about as poorly as possible in the Gunners' 1-0 win against Manchester United. Gyokeres finished with no shots and just three box touches, and he looked ineffective in duels. Drawing conclusions from one match would be silly, but it was a concerning debut. Sweden relies heavily on those two forwards and the currently injured midfielder Dejan Kulusevski for goals. If they aren't fit and firing, that could make qualifying even more difficult.

Each month, the World Cup Countdown selection committee (me) will highlight some of the best, worst, and strangest moments in the sport.

The brevity was the point. In just 10 words and three questions—“Can you tell us how he died, where, and why?”—Mo Salah managed to highlight exactly what UEFA's “tribute” to Palestinian player Suleiman Obeid left unsaid. Salah's post cut straight through the silence and forced everyone reading it to confront the omissions.

Can you tell us how he died, where, and why? https://t.co/W7HCyVVtBE

Obeid, nicknamed the “Palestinian Pelé,” was one of the greatest players in his nation's history. He was reportedly killed in Gaza by munitions dropped from an Israeli quadcopter while he was waiting in line for humanitarian aid. He was a father of five just trying to provide for his family.

UEFA later displayed a banner at the Super Cup between PSG and Spurs that read: “Stop killing children. Stop killing civilians.” But it was Salah's tweet that carried the most weight and reached tens of millions. 

New Zealand is famous for its vibrant wines, but none are aging more gracefully than the national team's 33-year-old striker.

On our preseason preview podcast, I pointed out how often Nottingham Forest went up 1-0 early in matches last season, how Wood massively overperformed his expected goals, and how both were bound to regress. Naturally, five minutes into the new season, Wood scored to put Forest up 1-0 on Brentford, and they cruised to a 3-1 win.

New Zealand isn't likely to escape its World Cup group next summer, but Wood's game still feels tailor-made for the international stage. His holdup play, aerial presence, clever runs in behind, and efficiency in transition are perpetually underrated. He's enjoying the finest form of his career, and if he can bottle this version of himself, he could be the key to New Zealand pulling off a shock or two in North America.

We're just a few weeks away from the first international break of the new club season, and that means World Cup qualifying will continue across four of the six confederations beginning on September 4. Here are three main storylines I'm following in the upcoming window. 

On paper, Senegal, Nigeria, and Cameroon are three of the best teams in Africa. All three were the top-seeded team in their respective qualifying groups, yet none are currently in first place with four matches to play. In Africa's unforgiving format, only the nine group winners punch a direct ticket to the World Cup, leaving anyone who slips to second facing a brutal playoff path.

In Group B, Senegal trail DR Congo by a single point ahead of their September 9 road trip. Senegal is currently unbeaten, but with just eight goals—four of which came in a match against South Sudan—in six matches, their attack has sputtered. They managed only a 1-1 draw at home against DR Congo in the first meeting, and the rematch now looms as the group's inflection point, with the winner heavily favored to finish on top. 

Cameroon find themselves in a nearly identical spot, one point back of surprise leaders Cape Verde. Fresh off an AFCON quarterfinal run that included a win over Ghana, Cape Verde now hosts Cameroon on September 9. Whoever comes out on top will seize control of the group.

Nigeria's path is considerably more precarious. The Super Eagles have just one win in six matches, sit in fourth place, and trail leaders South Africa by six points. Nigeria plays second-place Rwanda on September 6 and then visits South Africa on September 9. Anything less than two wins could leave Nigeria's World Cup hopes on life support.

CONMEBOL will be the second confederation, after tiny Oceania, to complete its qualifying process next month. Ecuador, Brazil, and Argentina have already clinched their spots, and Uruguay and Paraguay are near certain to qualify as they each need just one more point from two matches.

With Chile already eliminated and Peru's chances at almost zero, three teams are left fighting for the final 1.5 spots. Sixth place qualifies directly, while seventh heads to the intercontinental playoff. Right now, Colombia sits sixth and Venezuela seventh, with Bolivia just behind. And because Colombia plays both of their direct rivals in the final window, there could be plenty of drama on September 4 and September 9.

Here are the remaining fixtures:

Colombia—Bolivia (H), Venezuela (A)Venezuela—Argentina (A), Colombia (H)Bolivia—Colombia (A), Brazil (H)

Colombia should be able to take care of business against Bolivia, who struggles away from home. But if the Colombians drop points, their World Cup qualifying status could come down to a difficult away trip to Venezuela on the final day.  

Because Spain, Germany, France, and Portugal were in the Nations League semifinals and finals in June, none have begun their World Cup qualifying campaigns yet. Europe has a quick qualifying process for these top teams, who will only need to play six total matches across the next three windows.

Here are the highest-profile matches in September to mark your calendars

September 4—Slovakia vs. GermanySeptember 5—Ukraine vs. FranceSeptember 7—Turkey vs. SpainSeptember 9—Hungary vs. PortugalSeptember 9—Serbia vs. England 

All four of the European giants who start their qualifying campaigns in September begin play with the second-best team in their group away from home. Securing a win in that match would leave them as overwhelming favorites to qualify.

IF JAMAICA'S Reggae Girlz are to make it to their third FIFA Women's World Cup in a row, they will have to navigate Group B of the first round of the Concacaf W Qualifiers.

Jamaica, who have been to the last two World Cups in 2019 and in 2023, were drawn in the second of six groups during a Concacaf ceremony yesterday, and will have to contend with Guyana, Nicaragua, Dominica, and Antigua and Barbuda.

Only the group winners from the six groups, labelled A-F, will qualify for the Concacaf Women's Championship.

In Group A, Mexico, Puerto Rico, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and the US Virgin Islands will square off.

Group C is made up of Costa Rica, Guatemala, Bermuda, Grenada, and Cayman Islands.

Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Suriname, Belize, and Anguilla find themselves in Group D.

Group E includes Panama, Cuba, St Kitts and Nevis, Curacao, and Aruba, while Group F is made up of Trinidad and Tobago, El Salvador, Honduras, and Barbados.

The Concacaf W Qualifiers excludes the region's two highest-ranked nations, the United States and Canada, and will be played during the FIFA women's international match windows in November, and in February and April of 2026.

At the conclusion of the Concacaf W Qualifiers, the six group winners will join the United States and Canada in the eight-team Concacaf W Championship.

The competition will begin with the quarter-finals, followed by a play-in, semi-finals, third-place match, and final. To determine the quarter-final pairings and each team's path to the final, Concacaf will rank teams 1-8 based on the FIFA Women's Rankings, with the highest-ranked team facing the lowest-ranked team.   

At the conclusion of the quarter-finals, the four matchup winners will qualify for the semi-finals and guarantee their place in the FIFA Women's World Cup Brazil 2027, while the four losers will progress to a play-in, from where the two winning teams will each battle for a spot in the FIFA Women's World Cup Intercontinental Play-Off.  

The W Championship finalists will also secure a berth to the 2028 LA Summer Olympics Games Women's Football Tournament. Should the United States finish as one of the two W Championship finalists, then Concacaf's second berth will be awarded to the competition's third-place winner (based on the precedent of host nations' automatic qualification for previous editions of the Olympic Football Tournament at the Summer Olympic Games). 

The United States are the current champions of the Concacaf W Championship, having secured the 2022 title with a 1–0 win over Canada in the final held in Monterrey, Mexico. The tournament also served as the regional qualifier for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Canada, Costa Rica, Jamaica, Panama, and Haiti joined the United States in the global event, marking the first time six nations from the Confederation qualified for a FIFA Women's World Cup.

KIRO 7 Now



TACOMA, Wash. — In 295 days, the migration of 750,000 soccer fans to the Puget Sound will begin as the first World Cup matches begin. But who's counting? 

Community leaders in Pierce County are, as Pierce Transit got more than 100 of them together Wednesday to figure out how to collaborate and plan for the region's showcase on the world stage. 

A large showcase at that, according to Seattle FIFA Senior Vice President of External Affairs Dylan Ordoñez. Ordoñez put in perspective for leaders: The Super Bowl gets around 150 million global viewers. The least watched World Cup game brings in 200 million people tuning in world wide. He estimates, the six games in Seattle and seven games in Vancouver will bring 2 Billion eyeballs to the region. 

“It's going to take everybody to make sure this is a success,” Ordoñez said. 

Locally, the games will be accompanied by nine fan zones, from Bellingham, the Tri-Cities and Tacoma. 

“It's inclusion for people that can't necessarily get up to the games or can't make that kind of trek, they can still have a taste of the World Cup,” Mary Anderson, the Board President of the North Tacoma Soccer Club. 

The North Tacoma Soccer Club has seen the number of kids in their program double since 2020, Anderson points to the popularity of soccer in Western Washington as part of the reason. Still, she thinks the sport has room to grow. 

“Kids who might have been on the fence about how far they wanted to go in soccer might take that lead,” Anderson said. 

Anderson does worry about getting around with essentially the population of Seattle spread across the sound over the five weeks of matches. 

Ryan Mello, the Pierce County Executive who is also on the Sound Transit and Pierce Transit Boards says agencies are looking at “surge” levels for light rail trains, busses, and the Sounder commuter train. 

“This is a once in a lifetime opportunity,” Mello said, “I have every confidence in the world that Pierce Transit is going to figure out how to move our staffing around to accommodate this opportunity we have to help host the world here.”

Mello also mentioned new payment programs, like a multi-day Orca pass to make using transit easier for those visiting from around the world. While the location of the Fan Zone has not been determined, Mello says it will need to have transit in mind. 

“We need a fan zone that can safely accommodate folks and accommodate transit options. Those are key features,” Mellos said.

TOPICS:

PIERCE COUNTY, Wash. — Pierce Transit held a summit on Wednesday, featuring local leaders and Pierce County officials to explain how they're preparing for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in Seattle.

Pierce County officials expect their county and Tacoma to be one of the focal areas where the estimated 750,000 visitors for the quadrennial tournament will spill into for lodging.

Six games will be held at Seattle's Lumen Field, including one group stage game for the U.S Men's National Team, as well as two knockout games in the Round of 16 and Round of 32.

For those who aren't able to or willing to pay the hefty price tag of a ticket, there will be nine Fan Zones throughout Washington, including one in Tacoma. The official location has yet to be announced, but Pierce County Executive Ryan Mello said it will happen before the end of the year, likely within the next few months.



Fan Zones include Live match screenings, food festivals, local art and music showcases, and interactive soccer clinics. It's for this reason that Pierce Transit is laser-focused on creating solutions to the high traffic volumes they'll be faced with.

""Unless we want freeways and roads, jam and no parking, these people will be taking transit,” explained Pierce Transit CEO Mike Griffus.

Mello, who is also an acting member of the Pierce and Sound Transit boards, explains that Pierce Transit will be increasing its number of bus routes, while also looking to up the frequency of those routes to help fans get around the Puget Sound. One area they'll be focused on is the Link Light Rail expansion coming to Federal Way, which is expected to open in December 2025.

“Because of the capacity that we're going to have to serve, this is what we call [a] surge,"" explained Mello. ""It does make sense to run a lot of bus routes to light rail stations and then figure out how to run more light rail trains more frequently to deal with the number of people that we are serving.""

Mello also said that with such a major increase in ridership, with many international visitors being non-English speakers, they are exploring a new payment method, called ""Open Payment"" for their buses.

""We're working on Open Payment, so folks can just use the credit card or their debit card in their wallet to tap and pay and get to where they want to go in a much more seamless way.""



Mello said they hope to have that system running by early 2026. He and others at Wednesday's Summit expressed the excitement over the challenge and the opportunity for their local economy to benefit.

""They're not just coming to the games, they're coming to explore everything we have to offer, the beautiful region we live in, and get to restaurants and parks and Mount Rainier,"" said Mello.

Pierce Transit said it is still developing its plan to use state funds towards its World Cup preparations. They have until Dec. 1 to give the state a plan on how they would spend their portion of the funding.

A spokesperson explained that in this year's budget, the legislature set aside $9 million for transit agencies, which breaks down like this:

Therefore Pierce Transit will get a chunk of the 40% and 20% allocations of the $9 million.","{'href': 'https://komonews.com', 'title': 'KOMO'}","soccer"

The England international was set to join Thomas Frank's rebuild, but will instead link up with Mikel Arteta at the Emirates Stadium

At the age of 27, Eberechi Eze will finally play for a 'big six' club. He is set to swap south London for north, but not for the half that many had been expecting.

Tottenham had seemingly sewn up a deal with Crystal Palace, and the player himself was keen on becoming the new face of Thomas Frank's project. Alas, he will become an Arsenal player instead, returning to his boyhood club after first being released by the Gunners at the age of 13.

It's another memorable chapter for Arsenal in their long history of making Tottenham's life a little bit more miserable. From winning the league twice at White Hart Lane to pinching Sol Campbell off them for nothing, there's nothing Gooners like more than giving their little brother at the other end of Seven Sisters Road a wedgie.

However, as much as Eze's decision to choose red over lilywhite is personal and a lifelong dream in the making, he should be wary of the pitfalls of heading to a place where he will be just another player rather than the star.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The chaos that followed last Friday's dismal defeat at Rennes is likely to lead to two players leaving the club 

Fights between team-mates are more frequent than most fans think. Footballers are, by their very nature, competitive characters and emotions regularly run high at the very highest level, especially when under-pressure players are competing for major honours - and starting spots.

It's not uncommon, then, for arguments to break out on the training pitch or in the dressing room. In the past, we've even famously seen colleagues come to blows on the pitch, with Kieron Dyer versus Lee Bowyer probably the most famous example in Premier League history.

Of course, such spats can sometimes be a good thing for a squad, as they have the capacity to clear the air by allowing for a release of tension in a struggling team. It would be difficult, though, to portray Marseille's post-match meltdown on Friday as anything other than a very troubling development for Roberto De Zerbi and his players.

Indeed, the incident is being taken so seriously by the French club that Adrien Rabiot and Jonathan Rowe are both expected to be sold for their respective role in the dressing-room row in Rennes, while legitimate questions are also now being asked over the coach's ability to restore order at Marseille...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The Herons managed to secure the upset, but Mascherano's actions could result in further consequences

Lionel Messi missed Inter Miami's quarterfinal match against Liga MX's Tigres, but there was plenty of drama as the Herons edged La U de Nuevo León in a 2-1 thriller on Wednesday night.

Luis Suarez came through with two ice-cold spot kicks as a result of not one, but two handball calls on Tigres' Javier Aquino. Despite being underdogs without their eight-time Ballon D'Or winner Messi, Inter Miami got off to an inspired start. They held an advantage on possession and were more incisive than their Liga MX opponents - who currently sit sixth in the Apertura with a game in hand.

A shot by Suarez hit the bottom of Aquino's arm. After a VAR review, Suarez was awarded the penalty, which he calmly finished. Tempers flared after that play, as several players confronted each other. Reminiscent of his playing days as Liverpool and Barcelona's enforcer, Inter Miami manager Javier Mascherano also got into the mix - yelling at referees and players.

As he walked back on the pitch he was immediately show a red card and had to leave, but the controversy did not end there. Tigres took advantage of the chaos to seize momentum in the second half. 

Angel Correa, an international teammate of Messi and Rodrigo De Paul, took advantage of a poor loss of possession from Gonzalo Lujan and weaved past two defenders to score on Oscar Ustari - a shot that could have been saved had the goalkeeper been better positioned.

Mascherano, sitting just 20 feet away from the coach's bench in the stands, was seen using his phone to yell instructions. Cameras caught Lucas Rodriguez Pagano, his assistant coach, answering on the phone's loudspeaker.

Luck remained on Miami's side. Another penalty was awarded following a more obvious handball by Aquino. Suarez easily converted, shooting in the same direction to ice Miami's win.

First-year results show AI tool scanned 3.1m digital posts in drive to protect to tennis players from harmful content.

Top men's tennis players were shielded from more than 162,000 social media comments containing “severe” abuse during the first year of the artificial intelligence-powered ATP Safe Sport initiative, the sport's governing body has announced.

The abusive messages, which targeted 245 players, were found and then hidden in real time as the system scanned more than 3.1 million comments for harmful digital content following its launch in July 2024.

“Safe Sport creates a healthier online environment, free from hateful comments and negative messages,” said Serb Dusan Lajovic, the ATP Player Advisory Council member said on Thursday.

“This way, my social media presence is defined by who I am, not by my performance on the court.”

Tennis players, like many athletes, often have to deal with the wrath of anonymous abusers online. A study conducted by the governing bodies of the sport showed last year that many of the offenders were found to be angry gamblers.

Former world number three Elina Svitolina said this month, following her defeat by Naomi Osaka in Montreal, that she had been flooded with abuse and death threats, and blamed the “shameful” behaviour on disgruntled bettors.

Men's players are equally prone to abuse, and ATP Director of Safeguarding Andrew Azzopardi said that Safe Sport fundamentally changed how his organisation protected athletes online over the last year.

“More than one in 10 comments on players' posts were abusive – rising to 50 percent in extreme cases. While it won't eliminate abuse overnight, it's our first line of defence,” Azzopardi said.

“Safeguarding player wellbeing is a long-term commitment.”

During the first year of Safe Sport, officials escalated more than 3,300 comments while they identified 68 perpetrators and initiated 28 law enforcement referrals.

Beyond social media, the initiative, which currently covers the top 250 singles and top 50 doubles players, will also support athletes facing email threats, impersonation, deepfakes, as well as scams.

The ATP – which governs the men's professional game in tennis – added that it will enhance incident response protocols, broaden protections and advocate for greater accountability from social media platforms in the future.

LONDON -- The ATP Tour said Thursday its Safe Sport initiative has flagged more than 162,000 abusive social media comments directed at players in its first year.

The tour said more than 3.1 million comments were scanned, with the ones classified as most severe hidden from the 245 players who were targeted.

Safe Sport uses real-time AI to detect and hide social media comments from players' accounts. It launched in July 2024 and is available to the top 250 players in singles and the top 50 in doubles.

Andrew Azzopardi, the ATP's director of safeguarding, said the initiative has ""fundamentally changed how we protect our athletes online.""

The initiative was made available to male players in the world's top 250

The world's leading men's tennis players were shielded from more than 162,000 social media posts containing ""severe"" abuse in a year under a new system powered by artificial intelligence, according to the ATP.

An AI-driven safety tool scanned more than 3.1 million messages sent to the world's top 245 male players over a 12-month period and hid the abusive comments in real time. 

The ATP - which governs men's professional tennis - found through its Safe Sport Initiative that one in 10 comments to the male players contained abuse, while the ratio was as high as 50% on certain players' pages. 

""Safe Sport creates a healthier online environment, free from hateful comments and negative messages,"" said Dusan Lajovic, an ATP player advisory council member.

The ATP said more than 3,300 comments had been escalated for action to be taken in response since it started the initiative in July 2024 - making it available to the world's top 250 men's singles players and the top 50 in doubles.

It identified 68 people who sent abuse - with 28 referrals made to the police.

While a significant amount of abuse was discovered, Safe Sport was unable to detect every instant of abuse. 

Online abuse has been rife within the women's game for a number of years.

British number two Katie Boulter shared the scale of the online abuse she suffers on a regular basis with BBC Sport in June.

The 29-year-old said the abuse increased around Grand Slams and after defeats.

""At the very start of my career, it's probably something I took very personally... getting comments about the way you look,"" said Boulter.

""It becomes more apparent every single time you go on your phone.

""I think it increases in number and it also increases in the level of things that people say. I don't think there's anything off the cards now.""

Former world number three Elina Svitolina was targeted with death threats following her defeat by Naomi Osaka at the Canadian Open earlier this month.

Last Word On Tennis

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

It promises to be a superb day of ATP Winston-Salem quarterfinal action. Sebastian Korda leads American hopes, while the huge serving Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard will face Hamad Medjedovic. We here at LWOT give our predictions and analysis in this article, but which players do you expect to reach the semifinal?

Head-to-head: Fucsovics 1-0 Munar

Munar reached this stage after recovering from losing the first set against the defending champion Lorenzo Sonego, who ran out of steam after a long match in the previous round. Fucsovics defeated Roberto Bautista Agut in straight sets. Although Munar hits with more spin than Bautista Agut, neither of the Spaniards hits with overwhelming power. Fucsovics thrived with some time on his shots against Bautista Agut, and I think that could happen again.

Prediction: Fucsovics in 3

Head-to-head: Medjedovic 1-0 Mpetshi Perricard

Medjedovic's win against Mpetshi Perricard earlier this season was on clay in Barcelona. Although the Frenchman is dangerous on all surfaces, facing Medjedovic on a medium-speed hard court should suit him slightly more. It allows the 22-year-old a better opportunity to hold serve and swing freely in return games. The Serban ran Mpetshi Perricard ragged in the rallies in Barcelona, but I feel the changed conditions will allow the huge server to prevail narrowly.

Prediction: Mpetshi Perricard in 3

Embed from Getty Images

Head-to-head: First meeting

Bu's consistency has been relentless in his last two matches against Stefanos Tsitsipas and Mariano Navone. Van de Zandschulp lost the opening set 0-6 against Sebastian Baez before staging a dramatic recovery. Bu probably would not let the Dutchman off the hook like that if he started slowly again. The Chinese player seems entirely locked in right now, and I do not trust the inconsistent van de Zandschulp to match him.

Prediction: Bu in 2

Head-to-head: Korda 1-1 Kecmanovic

Playing his first tournament in almost three months, Korda won in three sets without being broken against Kamil Majchrzak. Although his game outside the serve has been rusty, the American has done well to get two wins after being out injured for so long. Kecmanovic's return is superior to Majchrzak's, posing a threat to Korda. However, I trust the No. 11 seed to successfully put enough pressure on Kecmanovic's average serve throughout the match.

Prediction: Korda in 2

NEW YORK — OK, sure, maybe it wouldn't be rational to say there's no point in actually holding the full US Open and instead just fast-forwarding to the inevitable matchup for the men's championship between Jannik Sinner — assuming he's healthy — and Carlos Alcaraz on Sept. 7.

Seems reasonable, though.

“We know,” Novak Djokovic acknowledged, “they're the dominant force right now.”

When singles action begins Sunday at Flushing Meadows, a change from the usual Monday start, there are cases to be made for various players to make their way to the women's final. The top three in the rankings — No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, No. 2 Iga Swiatek and No. 3 Coco Gauff — have won the past three US Open titles, for example. Other past major champions such as Naomi Osaka or Elena Rybakina have performed well lately; maybe a new face will emerge.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have won the last 7 Grand Slam titles

When it comes to the men, there really is just one name that matters in this post-Big Three era, and that name is “Sincaraz,” the silly, made-up, “Fedal”-style mashup of the guys who are ranked No. 1 (Sinner) and No. 2 (Alcaraz) and have claimed seven Grand Slam trophies in a row and nine of the last 12.

Djokovic took the other three in that span.

There is nothing quite like it in the women's game at the moment. The past five Slams were won by five players: Swiatek (Wimbledon in July), Gauff (French Open in June), Madison Keys (Australian Open in January), Sabalenka (last year's US Open) and Barbora Krejcikova (last year's Wimbledon).

‘Sincaraz' is a cut above as the US Open starts

“Sinner and Alcaraz,” said Marcos Giron, an American who has been ranked 37th and faced both, ""are bringing a ridiculous level, week in and week out.""

Look at the ATP rankings, which either could lead after the US Open. Look at the titles. Look at the past two Grand Slam finals, with Alcaraz erasing a two-set deficit and saving three championship points to win the French Open in June, before Sinner won in four sets at Wimbledon in July. Look at the most recent Masters 1000 tournament, the Cincinnati Open, where Sinner didn't drop a set en route to Monday's final but quit because he was feeling ill, ceding the trophy to Alcaraz.

That ended Sinner's 26-match winning streak on hard courts; Alcaraz was responsible for the previous defeat, too. Alcaraz collected his tour-leading sixth trophy this season and has won 39 of his most recent 41 contests.

Since Sinner returned in May from a three-month doping ban, Cincinnati was the fourth event both entered — and they met to decide the title in all four.

What makes No. 1 Sinner and No. 2 Alcaraz so good?

They hit the ball as hard as anyone. Sinner's returns rival Djokovic's for best in the game. Alcaraz's drop shots are unrivaled. The athleticism displayed by both is remarkable. Alcaraz might be the fastest guy around. Sinner's long limbs reach everything.

What sets them apart from others?

“Their confidence. Their ball-striking. Their movement is basically perfect,” said Sam Querrey, a former player who made it to Wimbledon's semifinals and the US Open's quarterfinals. “It seems like they hit the ball with just a little extra force when they need to.”

It leaves other elite players such as Ben Shelton, the 22-year-old American who is ranked No. 6, so-close-yet-so-far at majors.

Shelton's 2025 Grand Slam resume includes losses to Sinner at the Australian Open, to Alcaraz at the French Open and to Sinner at Wimbledon.

“Frustrating,” Shelton said. “Two very different players and challenges.”

How big a deal is the Alcaraz vs. Sinner rivalry heading to the US Open?

The sample size is, admittedly, small, but these two are producing the sort of riveting points and thrill-a-minute matches that Roger Federer vs. Rafael Nadal, or Nadal vs. Djokovic, used to.

“The rivalry is real. It's there,” said Darren Cahill, one of Sinner's two coaches. “And hopefully it's going to be there and real for the next 10 or 12 years.”

Not sure? Head to YouTube and check out Alcaraz vs. Sinner, whether at Roland-Garros this year or at the US Open in 2022 or pretty much any of their 14 showdowns ( Alcaraz leads 9-5 ).

“You have to earn every point, every game. He makes you suffer (from) the first point of the match until the last ball,” said Alcaraz, a 22-year-old from Spain. “It's really tough to find holes in his game.”

Sinner's take?

“We try,” the 24-year-old from Italy said of their matchups, “to push ourselves to the limits.""

Spanish tennis has always produced standout players, especially on clay courts. The pioneers were Manuel Santana, Andres Gimeno, and Manuel Orantes. Later, between the 1990s and 2000s, stars such as Carlos Moya, Juan Carlos Ferrero, and David Ferrer carried the torch. This era also marked the beginning of Rafael Nadal's legendary career, and today, Carlos Alcaraz is the sport's central figure in Spain.

However, during the 1970s and 80s, there was one player who stood out: Jose Higueras. A former top 10 player, he captured 16 ATP singles titles and reached the doubles final at Roland Garros.

In the 1960s and 70s, Spanish men's tennis was dominated by three central figures: Gimeno, Santana, and Orantes. Higueras emerged in the next generation, a young talent from Andalusia who came ready to challenge the top players of the era, including Guillermo Vilas, Yannick Noah, Jimmy Connors, and Ivan Lendl, among others.

Jose Higueras was born in 1953 and turned professional by 1973. His playing style was notoriously challenging for opponents of his era. Known for his incredible stamina, Higueras was a master at wearing down rivals, relying on consistent, low-risk shots that often forced errors from his opponents.

Many of the top players of the 1970s and 80s preferred to avoid facing him, knowing they could be in for a long, grueling match—especially on clay, his favorite surface.

Higueras' career spanned from 1973 to 1986. During that time, he claimed 16 ATP singles titles—15 on clay and one on hard court—and reached a career-high world ranking of No. 6 in 1983. In doubles, he won three titles and reached the 1978 Roland Garros final alongside Manuel Orantes, ultimately falling to Americans Gene Mayer and Hank Pfister.

After retiring from professional tennis, Higueras turned his focus to coaching, guiding some of the biggest names in the sport. Among his pupils were Pete Sampras, Jim Courier, Michael Chang, Carlos Moya, Guillermo Coria, and Sergi Bruguera. In 2008, he also worked with none other than Roger Federer, though their partnership was relatively short-lived.

By 2008, Roger Federer was already the world's top player, well on his way to becoming a legend. Ahead of the European clay-court season and with the goal of winning Roland Garros for the first time—a tough task at the time with Rafael Nadal in the mix—Federer brought in Jose Higueras to assist him during that part of the year.

Higueras helped Federer capture the title in Estoril, reach the final in Monte Carlo, and suffer a surprising first-round loss in Rome. Despite some uncertainty in their relationship, they continued working together. At Roland Garros, Federer ultimately fell in the final to Nadal.

Their partnership lasted only a short time, as Higueras was soon approached by the USTA (United States Tennis Association). In a 2024 interview with Punto de Break, he recalled: “When Federer won the 2008 US Open, the USTA guaranteed me an 8–10 year period to develop the plan I wanted, so I stopped working with Federer”.

When asked why he made that choice, Higueras explained: “Up to that point, I love tennis, ha. I thought that in that role I could impact a lot more people, especially kids and coaches, and that's why I did it. That lasted about 6–7 years, which is when a whole new generation of players came through. Two years ago I finished with them”.

When Patrick McEnroe took the reins at the USTA, he offered Jose Higueras a key role, even though Higueras was already working with the organization independently.

“When I was working with Federer in 2008, Patrick McEnroe called me and explained that he had been given the director position. He then offered me responsibility for the development program. At first, I said no. I knew perfectly well how the USTA works—I had been cooperating with them since 1989, but always independently,” Higueras said.

After stepping down from his USTA role, Higueras shared with Punto de Break what he is currently focused on and what he hopes for the future. “The only thing I would like to continue doing, as much as I can, is fighting to make tennis increasingly accessible to more people, especially children, creating more opportunities for those who dream of this sport,” he explained.

“At the peak of my program, we reached more than 45,000 kids. Tommy Paul, Frances Tiafoe, Taylor Fritz… they all came through the program at age 12. We would go to California, spot a kid who was playing well, contact their coach, and start working with them. This is the part of tennis I enjoy the most,” the Spanish coach concluded.

Petra Kvitova has opened up about the terrifying knife attack she suffered which put her career in doubt, admitting she was left 'crying on the court' and 'having nightmares'. 

The Czech Republic tennis star, now 35, is playing her final tournament this month at the US Open after announcing her retirement from the sport earlier this summer.

She shot onto the scene more than 14 years ago when she won Wimbledon in 2011, becoming the first player born in the 1990s to secure a Grand Slam title.

That first major was followed by a host of tournament victories worldwide, making Kvitova one of the most recognised names in women's tennis. 

But in 2016 she suffered a huge setback in her career after being the victim of a horrific knife attack when an intruder entered her home.

The criminal, 33-year-old Radim Kondra, told the sportswoman he was at the house to inspect a boiler before grabbing her from behind and holding a knife to her throat.

As she tried to free herself, Kvitova, then aged 26, suffered severe wounds to her left hand, leaving her fearing her career could be over. 

Before undergoing surgery, doctors gave her just a 10 per cent chance of taking to the professional court again - but Kvitova made a miraculous return just six months later. She too went on to win a further 12 titles on her way to a career high of world No 2. 

Now, ahead of her retirement, the tennis star has reflected on the petrifying ordeal.

'I knew I was a big fighter on the court but at that time I realised how I am an even bigger fighter in a totally different version of myself,' she told The Guardian this week. 

'That was great, even though it was very tough to play tennis. I cried on the court, I had really bad flashbacks, I was having nightmares. 

'So it wasn't easy, it took a while but it's all good now. There was a question mark, can I play tennis or not? And I could. It was my second career. It was amazing.'

Speaking about her retirement this month, the tennis star admitted she has 'no regrets' about her career. 

'You still remember how you played before, how everything was smooth and I was hitting winners and suddenly it's not there,' she added. 

'I'm totally ready [to retire]. I'm not regretting anything. I still love tennis but everything else, waiting for the practices, waiting for the car, waiting for a match, it's just tiring. 

'And having a son, it's a totally different life. I just want to spend more time with him as well.

Kvitova welcomed her son, named Petr, with her tennis coach husband in July 2024.

She goes into her final ever tournament in New York this week seeded 14th - and will no-doubt be hoping to end her career triumphantly. ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","tennis"

There was a familiar winner of the US Open mixed doubles title, with Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori retaining their title after the controversial revamp. Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud were their opponents in the final, with the runners-up having beaten Jessica Pegula and British No.1 Jack Draper in the last four.

While debates will rumble on about the validity of the new format, attention now switches towards the main draw, which is set to get underway on Sunday. Jannik Sinner is the defending men's champion, but fears about the Italian's fitness have grown in recent days, after he pulled out of Sunday's Cincinnati Open final.

Players at the US Open have been warned about 'sex-crazed bugs' which are expected to wreak havoc at Flushing Meadows.

That's according to the Daily Mail, who say players have been urged to stomp the insects to death.

The spotted lanternfly is reportedly expected to swarm New York during the tournament.

It will take place in the middle of their mating season, leading to a potential problem for organisers.

Emma Raducanu and Jack Draper will face qualifiers or lucky losers in their opening matches at the US Open.

Raducanu could meet Elena Rybakina in round three, while Jannik Sinner may await Draper in the quarter-finals.

Katie Boulter will play Marta Kostyuk in her opening match while Sonay Kartal will go up against Beatriz Haddad Maia.

Cameron Norrie was also handed a tricky draw, with the 29-year-old set to face Sebastian Korda in the first round.

Jacob Fearnley, meanwhile, will begin his campaign against Spanish veteran Roberto Bautista Agut.

The likes of Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic have also learned their fate after today's draw.



It's almost time for the US Open singles draw, when the world's top players will discover their path to glory.

The likes of Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic will be hoping for a kind draw as they go in search of Grand Slam success.

There is also plenty of British interest with Jack Draper and Emma Raducanu the main flagbearers in the singles events.

Nick Kyrgios has pulled out of the US Open singles draw for the third successive year.

The controversial Aussie has dealt with a string of injury problems in recent seasons.

He has only played five singles matches this year, winning one and losing the other four.

Here's what Jannik Sinner said about his early withdrawal.

Speaking after Monday's disappointing showing, he said: “Didn't feel great from yesterday. Also during the night, I thought I would recover a bit better, but it was not the case. And I just tried to go out for the fans, trying to give a match.

“That's the reason why I went on the court, but it was not meant to be for me today. So, you know, it happens. And, but another way, I don't want to take anything away from Carlos. He had a great week, great, great tournament again. And now the main focus, obviously, is for the US Open. And yeah, now recovery is the most important. And then we see.”

Rick Macci has praised Coco Gauff for partnering with biomechanical expert Gavin MacMillan.

Writing on X, he said: “Cori Gauff just made the best decision in his life for Coco. By hiring Gavin MacMillan this can be solved real quick and make her serve click. What she hears will be 100% different than anything in the past. He knows the issue and understands joint angles and soft tissue.

“This is not only a game changer for Coco hiring Gavin MacMillan but a Major League career changer. I saw the modifications biomechanically he did with Sabalenka on her serve and he rewired everything from start to finish. A biomechanical expert knows exactly the real culprit not a symptom others say and see.”



Darren Cahill has confirmed he expects Jannik Sinner to be okay for the US Open.

He said: “Jannik suffered from a virus that forced him to retire against Alcaraz on Monday.

“I spoke with him briefly last night. He's feeling a bit better now, he will rest today [Wednesday], that is the plan and hopefully Thursday he can get out on the court and start hitting some balls. We are confident he's going to be fine.”



Jessica Pegula has revealed she isn't expecting to be followed back by Jack Draper on Instagram.

She said: ""I followed you on Instagram... I realised you follow like five people or something. So, I don't think I'm getting that follow. But it's fine.""



Andrea Vavassori has spoken of his pride after he and partner Sara Errani won the US Open mixed doubles event.

He said: “We showed today that doubles is a great product. I think in the future we need more marketing and visibility.

""I think this product is something that can also work in the future. It was amazing to play on this court with so many people. I have to say thanks from the bottom of my heart for the atmosphere.”



Jack Draper has admitted he warmed to the mixed doubles event at the US Open.

Speaking at the tournament in the States, he said: ""If I wasn't playing the mixed here, I'd be training. I prefer playing on a big court in front of people. It gets your eye in quicker.""

Having previously called the event an exhibition, he went back on his original verdict, adding: ""[On Tuesday] there were times where it felt a little bit more that way from our opponents.

""Whereas tonight we were in the changing rooms, you're seeing Iga and Casper, they're like fully dialled in. It was intense.""



Carlos Alcaraz has been trolled by tennis star Danielle Collins.

Alcaraz partnered Emma Raducanu at the recent US Open mixed doubles event.

The pair were beaten in the round of 16, with Raducanu sharing pictures from the event on social media.

Collins replied to Raducanu's Instagram post, saying: ""Way to carry the team em!!!""

A joke that Raducanu was carrying the five-time Grand Slam winner on her back!



Sara Errani didn't hold back after securing the mixed doubles title with partner Andrea Vavassori at the US Open.

The Italian duo defended their crown, but Errani sent a pointed message the way of the tournament organisers following the win.

It comes after a controversial format change to allow the big-hitters of the ATP and WTA Tours to compete.

Speaking afterwards, Errani said: ""I think this one is for all the doubles players that couldn't play this tournament. I think this one is also for them.""



It was a bright and early start (or late night!) for those who stayed up to catch the end of the US Open mixed doubles action.

With that out of the way, attention is turning towards the main draw.

That gets underway in a couple of days, but will Jannik Sinner be involved?

The reigning champion is a fitness concern after pulling out of the weekend final in Cincinnati.

 Aug 21 - Amanda Anisimova, who has made an inspiring return to tennis since taking a mental health break in 2023, may have been on the wrong side of a lopsided Wimbledon final last month but expects that will only make her stronger for the U.S. Open. 

 The American made waves on the WTA Tour as a teenage prodigy but in 2023 took an eight-month break from the sport to focus on her mental health, a stretch during which she went months without picking up a racket. 

 Anisimova returned to action in 2024 and failed to make the main draw at Wimbledon but a year later the 23-year-old enjoyed a magical run to the final at the All England Club where she was brushed aside 6-0 6-0 by Iga Swiatek in 57 minutes. 

 ""When I got back to the locker room, I kind of had that switch in my mind of, 'You know what, this is probably going to make you stronger in the end and to not really dig myself down or put myself down after today and just try and focus on how I can come out stronger after this',"" said Anisimova. 

 ""It's honestly, like, a fork in the road. It's whatever direction you want to go in. I'm going to choose the path of working towards my goals and to try and keep improving."" 

 Anisimova's next chance at Grand Slam glory will come at the U.S. Open where the main draw begins on Sunday and where she lost in the first round last year and enjoyed her best result in 2020 when she reached the third round. 

 Despite having never reached the second week in New York, world number eight Anisimova has more reasons to be confident in her ability going into the year's final Grand Slam. In addition to her Wimbledon run, Anisimova won the first WTA 1000 title of her career in February, a triumph that saw her crack the top 20 for the first time in her career. 

 Anisimova, who was ranked as low as 359th in 2023 when she took a break, admitted her Wimbledon loss was ""tough to digest"" and knows she has improvements to make but takes comfort in finally having a Grand Slam final under her belt. 

 ""To be able to last two weeks in a Grand Slam is definitely something that you need to work a lot on. It's not an easy feat,"" said Anisimova. 

 ""Yeah, there's a lot of room for improvement, I think. If anything, I think it's more experience for me on how to handle nerves. It's my first slam final, so at least I have that experience now.""

The 2025 US Open is off to a great start, with the newly reimagined mixed doubles event proving to be a success. 

Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori clinched the title in the revamped tournament after defeating Casper Ruud and Iga Swiatek in front of a packed Arthur Ashe Stadium. 

With the conclusion of ‘Fan Week', the singles tournaments are now set to get underway at Flushing Meadows following the men's and women's draws.

As defending champions, Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka look to go back-to-back in New York, the fourth and final Grand Slam of the year marks the end of the road for one WTA star. 

Earlier this summer, two-time Grand Slam champion Petra Kvitova announced her retirement from professional tennis, stating the US Open would be her last tour-level event. 

Speaking to the Guardian ahead of the tournament, Kvitova said: “You still remember how you played before, how everything was smooth, and I was hitting winners, and suddenly it's not there.

“I'm totally ready [to retire]. I'm not regretting anything. I still love tennis, but everything else, waiting for the practices, waiting for the car, waiting for a match, it's just tiring.

“And having a son, it's a totally different life. I just want to spend more time with him as well.”

On regrets, the Czech star said: “I think I could [have won more]. But what can I do? I played in the final of the Australian Open [in 2019], I lost to Naomi Osaka when she played incredibly in the third set.

“There are always a few question marks in the number of grand slams. Being world No 1, that's what I'm missing.

“Probably that's the thing I would love to have. But if it's not happened, it's not happened. It would not give me a better life or make me happier.”

During her career on the WTA Tour, Kvitova won 31 titles, two of which came on the biggest stage in tennis. 

After bowing out in the semifinals the year before, Kvitova won the Wimbledon title for the first time in 2011, defeating Maria Sharapova in the final to hoist the trophy.

Three years later, she completed the feat again, overcoming recently retired Eugenie Bouchard in dominant fashion to secure her second crown at the All England Club.

Outside of her heroics in South West London, Kvitova won the 2011 WTA Finals and earned an Olympic bronze medal at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

U.S. Open

Defending champions Sara Errani/Andrea Vavassori won a dramatic 2025 U.S. Open mixed doubles final at Flushing Meadows.

The Italian pair and only recognized mixed doubles team in the tournament, beat third seeds Iga Świątek/Casper Ruud 6-3, 5-7 (10-6) on Arthur Ashe to claim the top prize of $1 million.

They defended their 2024 Grand Slam title in a shortened two-day format that included selected pairings dominated by top-ranked singles players.

In the day's earlier semifinals, Świątek/Ruud beat top seeds Jessica Pegula/Jack Draper 3-5, 5-3, 7-6 (8) in a thriller, before Errani/Vavassori overpowered Danielle Collins/Christian Harrison 4-2, 4-2.

Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori retain U.S. Open mixed doubles by outclassing singles stars

Did the sparks fly for you? It was certainly a novel idea — and plenty of fun was had along the way.

The final probably didn't need to be extended to six-game sets, but maybe without that it would have felt even less of a Grand Slam championship?

From here, I just hope the singles players involved are still fresh enough to perform at their best in the coming two weeks of the U.S. Open.

And lastly, I'm delighted the mixed doubles specialists took home the silverware and that MASSIVE check. Good for them and everyone they did it for.

Hopefully next time — if indeed there is a next time — a few more doubles players get to take part.

While the rain in Queens didn't affect the mixed doubles, U.S. Open qualifying during Wednesday did prove to be a bit of a washout.  

The persistent rain meant all qualifying matches scheduled had to be postponed.

The draw for the U.S. Open singles will be made at noon ET on Thursday (which is now today in NYC!).

Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori receive the championship trophy, with the fireworks behind them. They also get the winner's check worth $1 million. 

Errani thanked the passionate player box, led by Jasmine Paolini, and praised her doubles partner, Andrea Vavassori. 

“We are sharing these moments that are unforgettable,” Errani said. “I'm really happy to share them with you.”

Errani took a moment to appreciate the doubles players who couldn't play this tournament because of the singles pairings. 

“This one is also for the doubles players who couldn't play this tournament,” Errani added. “This one is for them.”

“We saw today that doubles is a great product,” Vavassori said.

A slightly awkward speech from Iga Świątek there, I thought. She almost wasn't quite sure how to frame what she had just taken part in and what had happened.

It's remarkable to think that she was playing in the Cincinnati Open at the start of this week — and now at midnight on Wednesday, she needs to start thinking about the U.S. Open singles that start on Sunday. 

Iga Świątek and Casper Ruud receive the finalist trophy for the U.S. Open mixed doubles title. Świątek and Ruud praised Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori for their win, recognizing how great they are at mixed doubles.

“You proved that mixed doubles players are smarter technically than singles players,” Świątek said.

Świątek also thanked the crowd and fans for their support.

“This event is to make you entertained and we did the best job possible.” 

With the lights dimmed inside Arthur Ashe Stadium, it's time for the trophy ceremony. 

The 2016 Rio Olympics gold medalists in mixed doubles are on hand to present the trophies: Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Jack Sock.

Here is more from that magic moment as Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori won the U.S. Open mixed doubles — not just for themselves, but probably for every doubles player in the world.   

One of the great traditions in Grand Slam finals is that the players go into the crowd and celebrate with their team in the player's box. 

Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, with the lights dimmed at Arthur Ashe Stadium, ventured into the crowd and shared an embrace with their respective teams. Errani hugged Jasmine Paolini, who was her doubles partner this year at Roland Garros en route to the women's doubles title. 

A heartwarming moment! 

FINAL: Errani/Vavassori 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 (6) Świątek/Ruud 

It's over! The Italians, Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, win the U.S. Open mixed doubles title. They defeat Iga Świątek and Casper Ruud in a thrilling three-set battle 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 (6) in one hour and 32 minutes.  

It is Errani and Vavassori's third mixed doubles title as a pair. They won last year's U.S. Open. They captured the French Open mixed doubles title this year. 

Now, they can add another U.S. Open mixed doubles victory to their trophy case. It didn't matter the new format ... this pair was going to find a way to repeat. 

Errani/Vavassori 6-3, 5-7, *8-4 Świątek/Ruud

Iga Świątek records her fourth double fault as they switch ends. If you recall, this is what happened in Świątek/Ruud's semifinal match against Pegula/Draper. 

It's 8-4 Errani/Vavassori. The Italians are two games from the title. Can they hold on? 

Errani/Vavassori 6-3, 5-7, *4-2 Świątek/Ruud

The teams change ends with Errani/Vavassori leading 4-2. After the Italians won the first two points, Świątek/Ruud have secured the last two.

This third seed doesn't go away.

Excellent start for Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori. Three quick points to put the Italians up a mini break in the third set. 

Errani/Vavassori 6-3, 5-7 Świątek/Ruud 

UNBELIEVABLE! This match is going to a third-set tiebreak to decide the U.S. Open mixed doubles championship.

Iga Świątek and Casper Ruud broke Andrea Vavassori to stay alive in the set. Then, they punished Sara Errani's slow serve to break and take the second set. 

A dramatic turn of events. Now, the teams will play a 10-point super tiebreak.

Buckle up! 

Errani/Vavassori 6-3, *5-6 Świątek/Ruud 

Five minutes ago, it appeared that Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori were going to be crowned mixed doubles champions. Now, Errani has to serve to stay alive in the second set. 

Incredible resilience from Iga Świątek, who serves her way out of trouble to hold. The third seed is one game away from forcing a third-set tiebreak. 

Wild turn of events at Arthur Ashe Stadium. 

Errani/Vavassori 6-3, 5-5* Świątek/Ruud 

What a game for Casper Ruud. The Norwegian delivers his best return game of the night. Just blazing groundstrokes, punishing Andrea Vavassori's serve.

Świątek/Ruud get the break to stay alive in the match. This set is deadlocked at five apiece. The crowd gets an injection of energy! 

Errani/Vavassori 6-3, *5-4 Świątek/Ruud

Here we go, folks! Andrea Vavassori will serve for the U.S. Open mixed doubles title up 5-4. 

Do Iga Świątek and Casper Ruud have one last comeback effort in them?

Errani/Vavassori 6-3, 5-3* Świątek/Ruud

Wow did Iga Świątek and Casper Ruud struggle with Sara Errani's slow serve in that game. After being up 0-30, Świątek/Ruud lost four consecutive points due to unforced errors. 

Now, Errani/Vavassori are one game away from the U.S. Open mixed doubles title. 

Errani/Vavassori 6-3, *4-3 Świątek/Ruud

It's just glorious to watch Sara Errani at the net. On break point, she takes the angle away from Casper Ruud, by hitting a smash volley that the Norwegian couldn't handle.

That was a dominant game from the Italian pair. Errani/Vavassori are two games away from the U.S. Open mixed doubles title. 

I think the one mistake they made was doing six-game sets in the finals. The four-game sets had developed a rhythm and everyone had seemed to be going with it. Now the six-game sets at the end of a long night become a bit of a slog.","{'href': 'https://www.nytimes.com', 'title': 'The New York Times'}","tennis"

Sachia Vickery is making her way through U.S. Open qualifiers this week, and fans looking to get to know her better will have to fork over $12.99 a month.

The American and 559th-ranked player divulged that she's also an adult content creator on OnlyFans and the experience has been life-changing.

“I'm very open-minded and I don't care what people think of me,” Vickery said during an Instagram Q&A this week. “It's also the easiest money I've ever made and I enjoy doing it.”

On her Instagram — where she counts over 40,000 followers — Vickery promises “spicy” OnlyFans content that includes her “longest shower vid,” a “late night stretch” and “boat twerking.”

Those who like what they see best be prepared if they want to take things to the next level.

“'I no longer date for free due to the behavior of men I now require a pre-date deposit send me $1,000 and we can make it happen,” Vickery wrote.

The 30-year-old has made a reported $2 million in 14 years of pro tennis and ranked as high as No. 73 in 2018, but has been wowed by the response to her racy account since she set it up in January.

“I will never talk s–t about girls on OnlyFans ever again for the rest of my life,” Vickery said in her Instagram Q&A. “Because the amount I made on there in my first two days, I am overwhelmed. I am just shook really.”

She's not the only tennis star to join the OnlyFans platform; Nick Kyrgios signed up in 2023.

For Vickey, it's always been about “pushing boundaries.”

“I've always been outspoken about racial hate I get online, body-shaming,” she said on the “Black Spin Global” podcast in June. “I'm very open about a lot of stuff. I'm still playing tennis. My career is still going, but I also want to do things outside of tennis. I'm starting to explore more opportunities on social media.”

“Being a tennis player definitely helped my marketing,” she added. “I'm at a stage where I don't do the absolute most on there but I'm comfortable as I need to be. I'm doing really well.”

That's been the case on the court, as well: Vickery kicked off a potential U.S. Open run with a victory over Anastasiya Soboleva on Tuesday, earning her a matchup against No. 21 Ella Seidel on Thursday.

Tennis pro Sachia Vickery isn't exactly a household name in the sport.

The 30-year-old Florida native is ranked No. 559 in the world as she looks to qualify for the 2025 U.S. Open. She's earned just over $2.1 million in her career so far as she's won three titles in the International Tennis Federation circuit. But any individual athlete, whether it's tennis or golf, will say earning sponsorship money is extremely difficult.

Because of that, Vickery turned to OnlyFans to supplement her career. She defended her decision to be active on the platform.

""I'm very open-minded and I don't care what people think of me,"" she said in a Q&A on her Instagram. ""It's also the easiest money I've ever made and I enjoy doing it.""

Fans who want the behind-the-scenes look at Vickery's private life will have to pay $12.99 for her content. If they want a more personal touch, that will be extra.

""I no longer date for free due to the behavior of men I now require a pre-date deposit send me $1,000 and we can make it happen,"" Vickery added.

She is far from the only women's tennis player, or female athlete, who has turned to OnlyFans for an extra payday. Arina Rodionova and Sofya Zhuk were among those who turned to the platform.

""I will never talk s--- about girls on OnlyFans ever again for the rest of my life. Because the amount I made on there in my first two days, I am overwhelmed. I am just shook really,"" Vickery added.

A rep for Vickery told People that what the tennis player does on that platform shouldn't be considered ""sex work"" and there is no ""nudity or sexual acts performed."" The rep added that she pursued OnlyFans while she was out for six months due to injury.

Coco Gauff is once again the home favourite while this is Aryna Sabalenka's last chance to win a grand slam this year

Aryna Sabalenka Is 2025 just not the world No 1's year? Finishing as runner-up in Melbourne and Paris and falling in the semi-finals at Wimbledon, Sabalenka has failed to get over the line at slams this season despite being a constant favourite. But with her powerful game and a devastating serve – especially on hard courts – she has the tools to make a deep run as the defending champion in New York. The Belarusian has racked up a total of 52 weeks as the world No 1, surpassing her compatriot Victoria Azarenka's 51 for the 13th-most weeks atop the WTA rankings since they began in 1975. Perhaps, like Roger Federer in 2008, the 27-year-old can triumph in the final slam of the year after making two finals and a semi.

Coco Gauff The love the 2023 winner receives at Flushing Meadows is palpable and it seems to elevate her game. Gauff stunned with a French Open win this summer, but the American's grass season was a struggle, culminating in a first-round exit at Wimbledon. The 21-year-old's weak serve, in particular, has been a point of discussion. “I am disappointed in myself when it comes to that part of my game,” she has said. “Serving well in practice, I would like to transfer it to the matches. I am winning, having one part of my game on a crutch. So if I can stand on both feet, then I can only imagine it is going to be a lot more straightforward.” Her 23 double faults in a win against Danielle Collins in Montreal were the most in a WTA level match since 2011.

Iga Swiatek After a stunning Wimbledon victory that included a historic double bagel in the final, the Pole enters the US Open as a favourite after a difficult start to the year. The 2022 champion appears to be back to her most dominant form and with a formidable head-to-head record against most of the field, the 24-year-old may have a significant mental edge over other contenders. Since the start of the 2020 season, she has claimed the most wins at the WTA level over grand slam champions with 44.

Jessica Pegula This year the American has won three singles titles, in Bad Homburg, Charleston and Austin, and reached finals in Miami and Adelaide, but has failed to go further than the fourth round in a slam. She is coming off a third-round upset to Magda Linette in Cincinnati, where her slow movement hindered her game. At 31, her chance to win a grand slam is getting slimmer, but she has a strong record on hard courts and in New York, finishing as runner-up last year.

Mirra Andreeva Though she has yet to win a grand slam, the 18-year-old is quickly becoming a serious contender. She has an aggressive baseline game, but her ability to keep focus when things fail to go her way needs improving. The Russian's 36-12 record in 2025 gives her two more wins than her previous best of 34 last year, and her run to the Wimbledon quarter-finals made her the youngest player to reach the top five since Maria Sharapova.

Madison Keys It is a good time for American tennis. Outside Gauff and Pegula, Keys will be another name that is expected to impress in New York. Her breakthrough grand slam win came this year in Australia, where she defeated Sabalenka in the final and, though she has not maintained that form, she remains a dangerous opponent. Emma Navarro, ranked No 11, will also hope to better her semi-final appearance last year.

Emma Raducanu The British No 1 is playing with a newfound freedom, saying she has never felt more confident heading to Flushing Meadows since she won the tournament. Since winning 10 matches to win the 2021 edition as a qualifier, Raducanu has not had a single victory in New York, suffering first-round losses in 2022 and 2024 and missing the 2023 tournament due to surgery. This will be her first grand slam with her new coach, Francisco Roig, who was part of Rafael Nadal's team from 2005 until 2022. It will also be interesting to watch Sonay Kartal in her main draw debut in New York. The Brighton native had an exciting Wimbledon run but lost in the first round in Cincinnati and lacks hard-court experience.

Venus Williams A legend of the sport and a former world No 1, Williams has received a wildcard into the main draw, an obvious decision given the much-beloved former champion will draw massive crowds. However, she has only three wins from 14 since January 2023 and last won a US Open match in 2019. While her love for the game is undeniable, an early exit seems probable.

Victoria Mboko The 18-year-old arrives brimming with confidence after winning her maiden WTA title at her home Canadian Open, defeating four grand slam champions along the way. Mboko started the season ranked outside the top 300. Seven months later she is the world No 24 and for the first time anywhere will be seeded. “The US Open, it's been one of my favourite tournaments ever since I was really little. It is very special for me.” Mboko said. “I don't really have many expectations for myself. I just want to have as much fun as possible.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"

The US Open is reportedly braced for an invasion of sex-crazed bugs, with authorities warning tennis stars, including Emma Raducanu and Jack Draper, to stomp them to death.

Researchers have warned the spotted lanternfly is expected to swarm New York, after making a comeback following a population plunge last year.

The bugs have reportedly been spotted in 29 of New York State's 62 counties during the summer.

Spotted lanternflies are an invasive planthopper, which are known for feeding on a wide range of plants.

The pests tend to be spotted more in late August, during their mating season.

With Flushing Meadows boasting the fourth-largest public park in the state, there are concerns players may have to tackle the bugs over the next two weeks.

Brian Eshenaur, an invasive species expert at Cornell University, told the Sun: ‘When somebody sees an insect, we ask them to take a picture first. And then stomp on it.'

The state's own Department of Agriculture has warned that the pest can impact the enjoyment of the outdoors, as they campaign for people to stamp on the bugs.

‘Spotted Lanternfly is a serious invasive pest with a healthy appetite for our plants and it can be a signiﬁcant nuisance, affecting the quality of life and enjoyment of the outdoors,' the department state.

‘The spotted lanternfly uses its piercing-sucking mouthpart to feed on sap from over 70 different plant species.

‘It has a strong preference for economically important plants and the feeding damage signiﬁcantly stresses the plants which can lead to decreased health and potentially death.'

Players already have an example to look to should they encounter a spotted lanternfly on court.

In a match at the Washington Open in July, a ballboy was spotted stomping on a bug that had been saved by tennis star Maria Sakkari.

British hopes at the US Open will be led by Draper and Raducanu, who will be eagerly anticipating the draw later on Thursday.

Draper made the semi-finals of the men's singles event last year, while Raducanu famously won the women's title as a qualifier back in 2021.

Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka are the defending champions. ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","tennis"

Officials with Wimbledon, the Australian Open and the French Open likely “have been watching … with intrigue” how the revamped mixed doubles tournament at the U.S. Open was received, but the other three Grand Slam events “are thought unlikely to follow suit in the near future,” according to Jonathan Jurejko of BBC.com. Tennis Australia is “equally as bold” as the USTA, but it does not have the “same financial clout to offer the mountain of prize money and sweetening appearance fees.” The same holds true for Wimbledon and the French Open, as well as the fact those tourneys are “generally more reluctant to deviate from time-honoured traditions” (BBC.com, 8/21). ESPN's Patrick McEnroe said he would be “shocked if the Australian Open doesn't do it in the beginning of next year.” However, he does not feel the same about the All-England Club instituting such a change. He said, “I'd also be shocked if Wimbledon does it because we know how Wimbledon works. They're a lot about the tradition” (Newark STAR-LEDGER, 8/21). McEnroe added, “For the most part, [mixed doubles] doesn't sell any tickets. It doesn't generate any revenue. Now you've got an event that absolutely does generate revenue.” McEnroe: “You can't argue with the fan interest. ... We're in the entertainment business. We're competing not just with other sports but entertainment vehicles. I think it's been -- I'd call it a home run if I was in baseball, but I'll call it ‘four aces in a row' for the U.S. Open and for tennis in general” (Rob Schaefer, SBJ).

U.S. OPEN SEEN AS A SUCCESS: Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, the only true doubles team in the draw, last night defeated Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud to claim the mixed doubles championship. At the conclusion of the match, McEnroe noted the atmosphere around the event was a “lot different this year with the almost sold-out crowd here inside Arthur Ashe Stadium.” He noted there was a “lot of hoopla about this new event” and claimed that it was “certainly a big success for the USTA and for tennis in general.” ESPN's Mary Joe Fernandez said, “I loved every minute of it. I loved seeing the top singles players out on the court on the doubles” (“2025 U.S. Open,” ESPN2, 8/20). Tennis journalist Ben Rothenberg writes the U.S. Open “stuck the landing on its U.S. Open mixed doubles extravaganza, packing the massive Arthur Ashe Stadium full of fans for a night session of an event that had consistently drawn paltry crowds for decades prior.” The USTA essentially made “something out of nothing by revamping the format completely to showcase star players who can fill arenas” (BENROTHENBERG.com, 8/21).","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","Mats Wilander Explains Why He Picked Jannik Sinner as Favorite for US Open and Not Carlos Alcaraz","https://www.yardbarker.com/tennis/articles/mats_wilander_explains_why_he_picked_jannik_sinner_as_favorite_for_us_open_and_not_carlos_alcaraz/s1_17325_42619157","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:15:57 GMT","

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz will enter the US Open as the heavy favorites to win. They have not only won the first three Majors but have denied other players the success since the 2024 Australian Open.

Novak Djokovic is the last player other than them to win a Major (beat Daniil Medvedev at the 2023 US Open). This season, Sinner beat Alexander Zverev in straight sets in the Australian Open final, lost the French Open by the smallest of margin against Alcaraz, who couldn't repeat the same when they met in the Wimbledon final. He was denied a three-peat at SW19 by the World No.1, who became the first player from Italy to win the grass-court Major.

Next is the US Open. Sinner will enter the tournament as the defending champion. Last year, he stopped Taylor Fritz from ending the American men's title drought in the home Slam with a straight-set win.

Alcaraz, although he suffered a shocking second-round exit in New York last year, beat Casper Ruud in the final in 2022. The tennis world has already started its prediction for the last Major of the season, and Mats Wilander picked the four-time Grand Slam champion to win his fifth Major. He told TNT Sports:

If I had to pick a favourite, I would pick Jannik Sinner, because I think that there's less of a chance that he loses early in the tournament than it is for Carlos Alcaraz.

Alcaraz has improved his head-to-head lead over the 24-year-old to 9-5 after their match in the Cincinnati Masters final. Sinner was forced to withdraw in the first set as he was suffering from flu.

And I know that (Alcaraz has) been in every final that he's literally played in, in the last few months. So, he doesn't really lose to players that are lower rank.

After failing to win his Cincinnati title, Sinner withdrew from the revamped mixed doubles event at the US Open. But Alcaraz, in less than 24 hours after his Cincinnati match, played his first mixed doubles match alongside Emma Raducanu. The pair lost to the first seeds Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper in the first set.

During his fourth-round match at the Australian Open this year against Holger Rune, Jannik Sinner suffered from a sickness and even sparked controversy by taking an 11-minute medical timeout. Last year in the Wimbledon quarterfinal, Sinner battled sickness and eventually lost to Daniil Medvedev in five sets.

After his withdrawal from the Cincinnati Masters due to sickness, Italian tennis commentator Guido Monaco observed one thing when Sinner is sick. Monaco thinks Sinner struggles in certain conditions, and he also pointed out the South Tyrol native often touches his upper stomach when he deals with some kind of sickness.

Sinner might be more fragile than others and suffers more in certain conditions. I'm fine with that, it makes him more human.

Sinner will now hope to recover completely before the US Open singles main draw, which starts on August 24th. If he fails to defend the title, he could lose his No.1 ranking to Carlos Alcaraz if the five-time champion adds the US Open to his trophy cabinet.

The 22-year-old has so far played eight finals this season, lifting six titles, including at the French Open. The two titles he failed to win were the Barcelona Open and the Wimbledon Championships. Sinner has so far reached five championship matches and lifted titles at the Australian Open and at Wimbledon and lost the matches at the Italian Open, French Open, and Cincinnati Masters, all to Alcaraz.

Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori retained their US Open mixed doubles title on Wednesday, beating Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud 6-3, 5-7, 10-6 in the final of a controversial new-look competition that kicked off action at the last Grand Slam of the year.

The Italians pocketed the increased $1 million first prize after two days of intense work in the 16-team event held for the first time outside the dates of the main tournament, in which singles action begins on Sunday.

The compact format and beefed-up prize money drew a slew of singles stars like six-time Grand Slam winner Swiatek, but also fierce criticism from some, most notably Errani and Vavassori.

Errani and Vavassori described the changes before the tournament as a “profound injustice”, though they were given a wildcard to defend their title.

In victory, they offered some thinly-veiled remarks that appeared to be aimed at the changes.

“This is for all the doubles players who couldn't play this tournament,” Errani said.

Vavassori added: “We have been on a mission.”

Doubles legend Kristina Mladenovic said it was “embarrassing” to hear the way players would say they are “going to have fun” playing the event as preparation for the singles draw. 

“A grand slam is neither preparation nor fun,” she told Eurosport. “It's years of sacrifice. When you're young, you dream of winning one, even in doubles.”

Wimbledon and Australian Open mixed doubles champion Jan Zielinski said before the event that there had been “no communication with players” about the change.

Meanwhile, Swiatek, the world number three from Poland, battled through a two-hour tussle with Jasmine Paolini to win the Cincinnati Open on Monday then hot-footed it to New York to team up with Norway's Ruud in the revamped mixed doubles competition.





Carlos Alcaraz, men's champion in Cincinnati, also turned out but he and British playing partner Emma Raducanu were eliminated on Tuesday, as was superstar Novak Djokovic, who teamed with fellow Serb Olga Danilovic.

The chemistry between Italians Errani and Vavassori, cultivated over a two-year on-court partnership that also saw them win the French Open mixed doubles title this year, proved decisive.

They roared to a 4-1 lead in the opening set of the championship match and after Swiatek and Ruud regained one break closed it on a confident hold from Vavassori.

Down a break at 4-5 in the second, Swiatek and Ruud won three straight games to force the 10-point match tiebreaker in which Errani and Vavassori grabbed a 4-0 lead and held on to triumph.

The first three rounds -- including the semi-finals on Wednesday night -- were played with short sets to four games with no-advantage scoring and a 10-point match tiebreak in lieu of a third set, before the final reverted to traditional sets with a 10-point match tiebreak.

Swiatek and Ruud clawed their way past top seeds Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper with a 3-5, 5-3, 10-8 semi-final victory.

Errani and Vavassori romped past the American duo Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison 4-2, 4-2 to reach the final.

Vavassori admitted he and Errani were on a “mission” to prove themselves against the singles stars.

Errani said after their 44-minute semi-final triumph that playing in front of a packed house under the lights on the massive Arthur Ashe Stadium Court was “amazing.” 

“It's the court where I feel goosebumps every time here,” she said.","{'href': 'https://www.foxsports.com.au', 'title': 'Fox Sports'}","tennis"

 Read more US Open insights and memories from ATP Tour stars in our ‘My US Open' series. 



You've played the US Open three times already. What is your first memory of the US Open?
I was there for qualies after I'd won an [ITF World Tennis Tour event]. I just remember walking in the locker room and seeing Novak [Djokovic] there preparing. They're not obviously there for qualies, but they are there early, just preparing. They're not playing Winston-Salem or any events that week. Just walking in and seeing those guys there is unbelievable. The past week I was playing in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and then I was here in New York. It was a surreal moment walking in and just seeing that many big names. 

Walking and seeing the wall, walking through the halls, looking at all the vintage US Open posters. It's just an amazing moment and [it was great] getting to play on Court 17, which I believe is actually the biggest court that I've played on all the times I've played there. I played Ernesto Escobedo on Court 17. It was just an unbelievable match, walking off the court and having full-body cramps. 

That's one of the only matches I had really walked off the court in my career where my legs were completely cramping, even when I was stretching, just full cramping. I have amazing memories there and I am looking to build up some more. 

How about when you were younger? Are there any particular matches or anything else that stand out as your first memories of the event? 
The first memory I have of the tournament is when DelPo [Juan Martin del Potro] won it [in 2009]. I was three or four years old, so I think it's probably the first memory I actually have of the Open and just watching and it wasn't Roger, Rafa, or Novak. Looking back now, looking at the wall, you see Roger for five years. You see Novak for however many years. It's nice seeing something different. 

What was it like when you got to the venue for the first time? 
I was like, ‘Oh, my gosh, this is huge'. Playing at night, night practices, everything. I remember actually hitting with Brad Stine at night, my first ever hit there. I just got there and ate Los Tacos No. 1, which is one of my favourite restaurants in New York to go to, but it was on site. Then he and I hit as if it was just another day at the club in Fresno, California. 

 Throughout my entire career, Brad and I hit thousands of times on Court 1 at Fig Garden Swim & Racquet Club. And then for my first ever US Open hit, it was he and I, just on Court 12 or something like that. It was an unbelievable moment. I think we took a picture afterwards, but it's going from a 12-year-old kid in Fresno to being at the US Open with your coach that started with you, and you're young. It is an amazing memory and moment for all of us that we cherished. 

What do you get at Los Tacos No. 1? 
The Adobada, for sure. There's pineapple, cilantro and onion on it. And then they do a fried quesadilla as well, it's unbelievable. So many calories, but it's so good. 

What's the best US Open match you've watched? 
That's a hard question. Maybe when Ben and Foe played, that was a pretty electric match. Carlos and Jannik, it was in the quarters. That five-set match there. I'd say those are some of my favourites. Nights at the US Open are something I'd love to be able to play and be a part of this year. 

Do you have a favourite court at the tournament? 
I think Court 5, especially when it's the middle of the afternoon, like 2 p.m., and all the courts are going, and especially if it's an American playing. It's an amazing atmosphere. Last year, I played qualies on there. I saw Spizzirri and Fonseca in the third round of qualies playing there and it was an unbelievable atmosphere for a qualifying match. The US Open does such a good job of getting people out there for the qualies. Some of the other tournaments and Slams, they don't do quite as good a job as that. So it's nice getting that many American fans out there. 

What about the city itself? You mentioned your favourite taco spot, but what do you like about New York? 
I love the restaurant scene. There's so many good places to eat. There's a tonne of shops and stuff to go to. I like going over to the Diamond District too, and just looking at all the watches. It's something that's just interesting, seeing how many different pieces there are and maybe getting one of them at some point in my life. Just wandering around New York, there's always something to do, something to look at.

Do you prefer to be on site most of the day? Do you like just exploring a little bit? 
I don't like being on site really long at all at any tournament. We try and do a good job of getting in, getting out, and getting what we need to do done. It gets really repetitive when you're there all day long. And so, when you're able to get away from it, go to a coffee shop, go to some store, it breaks it up, makes it not feel quite as much like a job, but really just something that you're enjoying.

When you might think of Wimbledon, you might think of strawberries and cream. What do you think of the US Open food? 
The Honey Deuces and Los Tacos No. 1. 

When did you first go? 
First qualies year. It was an eight-minute, 10-minute walk from the Intercontinental. We walk through Grand Central Station. I had never been through there, and then Los Tacos was right there. We went probably four nights because I was there for so long. I had doubles that year too. Qualies to main draw, doubles second round, is just a long, long time in New York. Fourteen days. That's a good problem to have, but you have to really figure out what you're going to do each day.

What's your big US Open dream? 
I haven't really thought about it. Just living in the moment, competing each day, getting as many matches as I can there. I think that's the thing that I'm looking forward to most. It's not every day that you get to be a 21-year-old playing at the US Open. I know a lot of my family and friends are going to be coming this year, which sometimes is a little bit of pressure when you're playing in front of people that you love and care about so much. But just going out there and being proud of the product that I put on court and just competing my a** off. 

 It's something that I always dreamed of, just playing in the US Open. I never really thought more of winning the US Open or making quarter-finals of the US Open. I try and stay away from picking outcome goals and I think it's more of, if I'm able to make sure I check off the box with each performance goal, then the outcome is going to come, and I'm going to just enjoy my time there.

 Gael Monfils is a fans' favourite wherever he competes, and the US Open is no exception. 

 The 38-year-old Frenchman holds a 33-16 record at the hard-court major, a tally that includes a semi-final run in 2016. Back this year for his 17th main-draw appearance in New York, ATPTour.com spoke to Monfils about his favourite US Open memories. 

 Read more US Open insights and memories from ATP Tour stars in our ‘My US Open' series. 



What is your first memory of watching the US Open?
It's a good question. I don't have much memory of watching the US Open. When I was young, I was at the French Federation sometimes and it was the middle of the night [in France], so there was no chance to watch tennis.

What about your first memories of playing the US Open, either as a junior or as a pro?
I played in ‘03 my first US Open in juniors and I lost to Brian Baker in the second round.

What were your thoughts about the venue the first time you went to the US Open?
I loved it. I loved the energy, it was crazy good. Straight away I felt like it was a tournament I wanted to do well at.

As somebody who likes to entertain the crowd, is there a special vibe at the US Open with fans going crazy?
It's unbelievable, now it's like a second home for me. I really feel great there. The crowd is amazing and the energy is unbelievable. I always look forward to going to New York.

A post shared by Gael Monfils (@iamgaelmonfils)





What is the most memorable match you've played there?
Many matches, to be honest. I don't have one special because I've had many great matches, great memories there. Even tough battles that I lost — I remember I lost a tough one, a five-setter against Juan Carlos Ferrero [in 2011].

Do you have a favourite court other than Arthur Ashe Stadium?
No, Arthur Ashe is my idol as well, so for me it's always special to play on that court. That is my favourite.

What about the city itself? Did you enjoy it the first time you went?
For me, it was amazing. My first time there was my second time in America, so for me it was unbelievable. It was exactly what I saw in the NBA, because I was watching more NBA than tennis. I could see a different energy and a different culture. When I came for the first time, I was amazed and I knew I would love this country.

If you could plan a perfect non-tennis day in New York City, what would that look like?
It's different now because you grow up in age. Right now it would be different than when I was young. I can't really tell you now exactly, because it's my second year that I will bring my daughter. It's completely different from when you are 18 or 25. A perfect day is to chill, see around, have great shows. Easy.

Have you ever ridden the subway?
Of course, you have to take the subway. For sure as a French guy, you've [been on] many subways.

What about your favourite food in the city? Would you eat at some of the street vendors?
Sometimes, yes. Then I have some great restaurants that I like to go back to every year.

Have you spent any time at Central Park?
Of course. I used to practise there actually in between matches. I was staying in the city, so I was practising at Central Park during the day off.

The inaugural star-driven mixed doubles event at the U.S. Open ended with Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori outlasting Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud in a match tiebreak.

Back before the US Open mixed doubles tournament became a singles-dominant event, Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori took the title a year ago.

This year, with so many top singles players in the draw, the Italian team was something of an afterthought. And why not?

In Thursday night's final, it was the unseeded wild-card team of Errani and Vavassori up against the No. 3 seeds Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud, ranked No.2 and No. 12 in singles.

For the record, Errani came into the match ranked No. 291 singles among Hologic WTA Tour players and Vavassori was the ATP Tour's No. 306, having split two matches this year and compiling a career record of 10-13 for his career.

No contest, right?

Wrong. The doubles players, playing the game to which they're accustomed, prevailed 6-3, 5-7 [10-6] in a match-tiebreak.

“I guess doubles players are better tactically than singles players,” Swiatek said afterward.

The 38-year-old Errani and Vavassori defended their title in front of an enthusiastic, sold-out Arthur Ashe Stadium and collected a cool $1 million, which they will split.

“Thanks to my partner,” Vavassori told the crowd. “Thanks for the energy, it's unbelievable for me to play with you. We've shown today that doubles is a great product.”

With the mixed title at Roland Garros this spring, they have now won three of the past five Grand Slam mixed titles.

Both sides converted three break points, but Errani and Vavassori were more efficient, stroking 25 winners, against only 12 unforced errors.

“I loved every minute of it,” ESPN analyst Mary Joe Fernandez said. “These two, Vavassori and Errani, they know each other's style, they know each other so well.  I think in a year we'll see better meshing from the singles players.”

The final came only after both semifinals were decided earlier Wednesday. Here's how the path to the championship match unfolded.

No. 3 Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud def. No. 1 Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper 3-5, 5-3 [10-8]

After 12 straight mixed doubles matches that ended in straight sets, this one went the distance. But when Swiatek double-faulted, she and Ruud found themselves down 8-4 in the match-tiebreak. Somehow, they found a way to win the last six points. The final stroke was a winner from Swiatek who called it the “most important volley of my life.”

Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori def. Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison 4-2, 4-2

The winners took 18 of their 21 first-serve points and five of 11 second-serve points. “Goose bumps,” Errani said afterward. Vavassori and Errani were far more efficient, hitting 20 winners and only six unforced errors.

To win the title, they would need to topple Swiatek and Ruud, who first bonded over the clay-court swing when Ruud expressed his support for the former world No. 1 after a disappointing defeat at the Mutua Madrid Open. Competing together for the first time in Flushing Meadows, they shrugged off Swiatek's quick turnaround from winning the Cincinnati Open to beat both Madison Keys-Frances Tiafoe and Caty McNally-Lorenzo Musetti in straight sets. In the semifinals, they rallied from a set down and won the match tiebreak from 4-8 down to book their first mixed doubles major final.""It's been an honor and really fun to share the court with Iga and other players,"" Ruud said. ""It's the first time they're doing this. I know it's created a lot of reaction, somewhat bold to do it. You can't argue that it's not great for fans because you have full packed Arthur Ashe at midnight on a Wednesday of the quallie week.

But just as the Italians looked to have the match sewn up, Swiatek and Ruud scored a crucial break as Vavassori served for the match, breaking Errani to force another Sudden Death.With the title on the line, Errani and Vavassori stepped up once more, showing superior net play to take a 9-5 lead on the Polish-Norwegian team, converting their second championship point when Swiatek netted a final volley.

We show that you have to think, be smart. On doubles there are more things than hitting the ball. Sara Errani

""In doubles is not just serving good, hitting good, returning good,"" said Errani, herself a former top tier singles player. ""There are many other things that are not easy. I think the doubles players improve that things a lot to see, to cross, many other thing that is not only hitting the ball.""We show that you have to think, be smart. On doubles there are more things than hitting the ball. Singles has other things and doubles has another things. We show that we are good on doubles, you know, to change the game, to know what to do.""While Errani and Vavassori will look to make a clean sweep when they enter their respective doubles events next week, Swiatek and Ruud will both feature in the singles. Swiatek will be the No. 2 seed after winning her sixth Grand Slam title at Wimbledon earlier this summer. Ruud, a former US Open finalist, is projected to be the No. 12 seed in the men's singles tournament.

NEW YORK—Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper have come a long way from the “four words” they claim to have exchanged prior to their US Open mixed doubles partnership.But despite an impressive run to the semifinals, Pegula doubts she's getting that follow-back on IG.“I followed you on Instagram,” Pegula told Draper during their post-match press conference. “I realized you follow like five people or something. So, I don't think I'm getting that follow. But it's fine.”It turns out Draper, who has 479,000 followers, actually follows seven accounts on his official Instagram page: a mix of brands, sponsors, and two Alzheimer research and charity accounts—the latter to raise awareness of the disease following his grandmother's 2015 diagnosis.

“I don't really go on it too much,” replied a sheepish Draper, who learned from the on-court announcer that Pegula hailed from Buffalo, New York.The pair tried to keep things loose despite the intensity of the moment, Draper singing along with the Arthur Ashe Stadium DJ in the midst of their clash with Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud.“I was like, Oh, a Goo Goo Dolls fan?” teased Pegula. “He actually sang [Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls] at one point on the changeover, which was pretty funny,” said Pegula.Though the duo ultimately lost, 3-5, 5-3, 10-8 in the match tiebreaker, Draper enjoyed his first US Open night session in front of a full Fan Week crowd.

“It's such a good feeling to get the energy from the crowd,” said Draper, who will likely be the No. 5 seed in the men's singles draw.“It was a lot of fun.

Grill the Grid 2025 | Episode 3: Spot the mistake

Valtteri Bottas has been linked with a seat at new team Cadillac in recent weeks – and his current boss Toto Wolff would support such a move.

Mercedes boss Toto Wolff believes that Valtteri Bottas is fully deserving of a Formula 1 comeback, amid the Finn's links to the Cadillac F1 Team ahead of their debut 2026 season.

Bottas dropped off the F1 grid at the end of 2024, having lost a race seat at Kick Sauber, which led to him rejoining Mercedes in a reserve role alongside regular drivers George Russell and Kimi Antonelli.

Although he has not been racing, Bottas is still playing a key role at the Silver Arrows – a team he previously raced with from 2017 to 2021 – through simulator work and his presence at the track.

With the aforementioned Cadillac team set to arrive on the grid next year, and 10-time Grand Prix winner Bottas one of the names being tipped for a drive, Wolff has shown his support.

“Valtteri has been part of the Mercedes family for a long, long time,” began Wolff, talking in a mid-season review video for his team's social media channels.

“He is a driver that, if some of our guys would have fish poisoning, you put him in the car and he's going to be absolutely on [the] pace. That's great to know, that your reserve and third driver is as quick as it gets.

“But obviously, with Valtteri, he deserves a race seat. Hopefully that door is going to open. Watch this space.”

Bottas himself has described Cadillac's project as “very interesting” – the operation being backed by TWG Motorsports and General Motors, and led by former Virgin Racing/Marussia chief Graeme Lowdon.

“[It's] something new to F1, an American team with maybe a different view to the sport,” he told F1's Beyond The Grid podcast earlier this year. “If I would be there as a driver, it would be actually very interesting because you can start from scratch.

“The team starts from zero. You could actually make a big influence on certain things, which direction to go, and that would be very motivating and rewarding when the success comes.

“I think the rule change is always a good point to jump in because you just never know, if you suddenly get it right you might actually be doing really well from the get-go.”

Along with Bottas, another experienced pair of hands in former Red Bull driver – and six-time Grand Prix winner – Sergio Perez has been linked to Cadillac, who are yet to confirm either of their two drivers for 2026.

Grill the Grid 2025 | Episode 3: Spot the mistake

The F1 ACADEMY grid are preparing for Round 5 in Zandvoort, with Esmee Kosterman set to make her debut as the Wild Card entry.

Esmee Kosterman will make her F1 ACADEMY debut on home soil as the Wild Card entry for Round 5 of the 2025 campaign, with the Dutch driver representing TeamViewer, the global leader in remote connectivity and digital workplace solutions.

The 20-year-old will race at the Circuit Zandvoort in a special edition livery that highlights innovators and changemakers driving progress – on and off the track.

Kosterman began racing cars in 2021, competing in the Ford Fiesta Sprint Cup Benelux. She became the first woman to win in the series two years later before going on to finish second in the Junior Cup and third in the overall Standings.

Moving into single-seaters last season, Kosterman scored points on her Indian F4 debut, whilst this year has seen her race in British F4, with appearances at Zandvoort and the non-Championship round during the British Grand Prix.

In celebration of TeamViewer's Visibility Drives Change campaign, which encourages women to see themselves as the leaders of tomorrow, the faces of women inspiring change will feature on Kosterman's #86 F1 ACADEMY car. The livery will feature over 200 women on the car, with these role models inspiring women across a range of industries, in workplaces, in paddocks and in their personal lives.

In addition to the specially designed livery, Kosterman's race number recognises the power of female role models, with findings from TeamViewer's Women in Sport Tech report, produced in collaboration with Loughborough University London, indicating that 86% of women believe that having visible female leaders is key to gender equality in the workplace.

Karin Fink, Head of Commercial Operations, F1 ACADEMY said: “Our sport has the power to inspire change, and we are incredibly proud to be championing women both on and off track. We know that creating female role models in motorsport is already helping to improve participation at the junior level of racing, and working with TeamViewer, we are excited to take this further and inspire the next generation of women in STEM.

""Together our mission is to empower the next generation of female leaders and send a clear message: your presence matters, you are driving change.”

Faith Wheller, VP of Brand, Integrated Marketing and Sports Partnerships, TeamViewer added: “It is our ambition to drive meaningful change both on and off the track. The opportunity to support Esmee in her F1 ACADEMY debut while driving a car featuring role models is the next step in achieving this.

""Our research found that not being able to see someone like you in a senior role made it harder to see a career in your chosen field. This is why it was so important to showcase so many role models on the car. Working with the F1 ACADEMY to see this come to life has been a highlight of the partnership so far. We look forward to supporting Esmee in person at her home race.”

Grill the Grid 2025 | Episode 3: Spot the mistake

Formula 1 fashion has moved from grid glamour to everyday style. Lando Norris leads the charge, carving out his own distinctive look on and off the track. Here's how his style has evolved since his debut in 2019...

Fashion has become as much a part of the Formula 1 spectacle as the racing itself. The paddock has become a runway, with the drivers setting the tone. Among the new generation on the grid, 2025 title-challenger Lando Norris has carved out a distinct off-grid fashion identity.

Since his rookie season in 2019, Lando's style has evolved from the familiarity and simplicity of his papaya McLaren team kit to a playful mix of casual comfort and polished luxury. Whilst the young Brit is making his mark on-track, his aesthetic style has become a central part of his journey in the sport.

""I don't think of myself as stylish,"" the McLaren man told Vogue with typical self-awareness. ""But people want to see who we are, not just our helmets"".

That sums up this shift – F1 style today is about personality, identity and the way drivers choose to express themselves, both on and off the track.

Lando's style story starts in pure easy comfort. Early in his paddock days during 2019 and 2020, his uniform was simple: hoodie, sweats, sneakers, and the team kit. The McLaren driver's early look epitomised a British teenager whose life revolved around racing. That stripped-back yet slightly personal touch resonated with younger fans, who saw in him a version of themselves; casual, relatable, and more interested in being comfortable than conforming to old-school style codes.

Still, there were always hints of personality, whether it was an unexpected pop of colour, a playful accessory, or a casual twist to the kit that suggested his style instincts were there from the start, just waiting to surface.

During 2020, Lando began turning that identity into something bigger with the launch of Quadrant. His own lifestyle brand reflected exactly who he was at the time with a range of hoodies and graphic tees; bright, playful, youthful and firmly Gen Z.

For Lando, the goal was for the brand to feel authentic – not just another piece of F1 merchandise. ""It's where I can represent the casual side of me, the normal side of me, not the Formula 1 racing driver side,"" he explained to GQ Sports. ""So, I think that's what makes it a lot better.""

Lando's style works because it fluctuates. In the paddock, he can also lean into sharper, more polished looks that show how far he's come from hoodies and sweats. That versatility hasn't gone unnoticed, as fashion houses have tapped him to front several campaigns – such as Dior, Ralph Lauren and Tumi – a sign that the industry sees his appeal beyond racing.

Yet away from the spotlight, he's back in hoodies, sneakers and candid fits that mirror the side fans know from behind the scenes on social media. That balance of luxury when it matters, casual when it doesn't, is what makes his aesthetic click. It feels lived-in, not curated.

That balance is his signature. ""It's where I can represent the casual side of me, the normal side of me, not the Formula 1 racing driver side,"" he explained to GQ Sports. ""So, I think that's what makes it a lot better.""

Even as his wardrobe evolves, he stays grounded, blending everyday hoodies with the occasional designer look.

Lando's style doesn't follow the familiar F1 script of sharp tailoring and high-gloss appearances that so many other drivers have adhered to over the years. Instead, it reflects the broader mood of his generation – fluid, playful, and unbothered by the idea of being ‘fashion perfect'. For Lando, clothes aren't about projecting status as much as projecting self.

That outlook is what makes his aesthetic resonate with fans. He's less concerned with trends than with expressing his personality, whether that's through a designer campaign or a quick TikTok fit-check. His appeal lies in the consistency: comfort, authenticity, and a refusal to treat fashion as something separate from everyday life.

As he told Vogue: “I just wear what I like and what feels comfortable. If people think it looks good, then great.” It's a sentiment that could easily sit on any Gen Z mood board, and explains why his style has become part of his public identity outside of his performances.

In an era where drivers are as much cultural figures as athletes, Lando embodies how fashion can be approachable without losing relevance. He shows that you don't have to be a couture obsessive to make an impact – you just have to be real.

Part of what makes Lando's style resonate with so many is the way it's experienced. Unlike earlier eras of F1, where fans only saw drivers in curated magazine shoots or sponsor appearances, Lando's fashion lives in the immediacy of Twitch streams, TikTok edits, Instagram posts, and candid paddock walk clips. His outfits don't exist in isolation – they circulate, get memed, clipped, and reinterpreted by fans online.

That dynamic has shaped how his aesthetic is perceived. A hoodie or a football jersey isn't just clothing – it becomes part of a shared culture between Lando and his fanbase, one that blurs the line between athlete, streamer, and fashion figure. His style doesn't demand attention through extravagance; instead, it gathers momentum through relatability, repeatability, and the viral loops of a digital fandom.

In a sport where image has always been paramount, Lando shows how fashion can thrive in the era of content; not as a polished billboard, but as an ongoing, interactive story.

Grill the Grid 2025 | Episode 3: Spot the mistake

With Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri proving a formidable pair for McLaren, the duo are emulating the achievements of strong driver line-ups from the team's past.

The first half of the 2025 season has seen McLaren not only carry forward their championship-winning form from last year but build on it even further, with Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri leading a seemingly two-horse race for the title whilst also giving the squad a huge lead in the Teams' Standings.

Both Norris and Piastri have earned praise for their commanding performances along the way, making them a driver pairing that looks set to follow in the footsteps of other impressive duos to have raced for the Woking-based outfit over the years. As such, we've been taking a look back at eight of McLaren's strongest line-ups from seasons gone by…

Should Norris and Piastri seal the Teams' Championship for McLaren this season, they will be emulating the achievements of Niki Lauda and Alain Prost, the first drivers to take back-to-back titles for the squad back in the 1980s.

Prost had won a number of races with Renault when he arrived at McLaren in 1984 to partner the then two-time World Champion Lauda. It was Prost who triumphed at the season-opening race in Brazil, kicking off a campaign that would see the outfit claim victory in 12 out of 16 Grands Prix.

While Prost won on seven occasions in comparison to Lauda's five, the latter ultimately took the title by just half a point from his team mate. But the French driver did not have to wait long to achieve the feat himself, beating Lauda to the championship in 1985 before the Austrian walked away from the sport at the end of the season.

One pairing who just missed out on claiming consecutive Teams' titles – despite succeeding in the Drivers' Championship – were Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard, who raced alongside each other at McLaren between 1996 and 2001.

During those six years, the partnership scored 30 wins between them including 13 1-2 finishes, as well as 33 pole positions. However, while the duo were a strong force, it was Ferrari's Michael Schumacher who ultimately became Hakkinen's main opponent for the title in 1998.

The Finn triumphed, McLaren taking both championships that season, while he went on to narrowly beat the Scuderia's Eddie Irvine to a second Drivers' crown in 1999. Though Hakkinen and Coulthard did not bring home another title in the years that followed – as Ferrari's period of dominance started to take hold – they ensured that McLaren remained the Italian outfit's closest challenger.

After Hakkinen opted to leave Formula 1 at the end of 2001, another ‘flying Finn' joined the team in the form of Kimi Raikkonen. But with McLaren struggling in comparison to the high-flying Ferrari – dropping back to fifth place in 2004 – title success again eluded the squad.

However, amid the introduction of new technical regulations, the team looked to be in resurgent form in 2005, a season in which they also welcomed race winner Juan Pablo Montoya as Raikkonen's team mate following Coulthard's switch to Red Bull.

The pair notched up 10 victories between them, two more than rivals Renault in a championship fight that saw them only just lose out to the French manufacturer. Things proved more challenging in 2006, a year in which Montoya exited midway through the campaign while Raikkonen went on to sign with Ferrari for 2007 – more on which in the next entry…

Following the end of the Raikkonen and Montoya era, McLaren made a bold move for 2007, recruiting reigning World Champion Fernando Alonso from Renault to be paired with a rookie by the name of Lewis Hamilton.

What came next was a memorable season in which both drivers fought for the World Championship alongside the Ferrari of Raikkonen, with an increasingly tense intra-team rivalry brewing along the way at the Woking-based outfit.

Alonso and Hamilton both lost out on the title to Raikkonen by one point and the partnership between them came to an end after just one season, with Alonso making an early exit from the team to rejoin Renault for 2008 – a year in which Hamilton would become a champion for the first time.

In terms of delivering championship success, the pairing of Emerson Fittipaldi and Denny Hulme – both proven World Champions – was an inspired move for McLaren in 1974.

Hulme opened the campaign with victory in Argentina – a win that would ultimately to be his last in Formula 1 – while Fittipaldi triumphed in front of his home crowd at the next event in Brazil. After standing on the top step twice more that year, Fittipaldi became a champion for the second time.

It was a first for McLaren, however, and the Brazilian racer's partnership with Hulme also brought home the squad's debut Teams' Championship. The outfit have gone on to clinch a total of nine in the time since, with their longest consecutive run of titles being kicked off by perhaps their most famous line-up…

Prost's second appearance in this list is of course alongside Ayrton Senna, a line-up that became perhaps the team's most famous. Following the exit of Lauda, Prost was partnered with Keke Rosberg and Stefan Johansson in 1986 and 1987 respectively before McLaren brought in rising star Senna for 1988.

The combination of Prost – by that stage a two-time champion – alongside the proven race winner Senna and the remarkable MP4/4 car led to a dominant campaign for the squad, with McLaren taking victory in all but one race while Senna beat his team mate to the title by just three points.

Tensions between the two drivers boiled over in 1989, culminating in a controversial collision in Japan that saw Prost seal a third championship. The Frenchman departed for Ferrari at the end of the campaign but the rivalry remained, while McLaren backed up the two Teams' titles won by Senna and Prost with another two in 1990 and 1991, marking their most successful championship-winning streak.

Another driver to make a repeat appearance in this rundown is Hamilton. Following two seasons racing alongside Heikki Kovalainen after Alonso's departure, the Briton welcomed a new team mate in 2010 in the form of Jenson Button.

With Button having just won the World Championship for Brawn GP, the all-star line-up paired the two most recent Drivers' title winners together and, during the three years that followed, the duo brought home a total of 19 victories for McLaren.

Title success ultimately eluded the team during this era, with Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull embarking on a run of consecutive championships. Hamilton started a new chapter with Mercedes in 2013, while Button remained with the squad and later went on to pair with another champion – a returning Alonso – in 2015 and 2016.

Unfortunately for Alonso, his comeback to McLaren coincided with one of the toughest phases in the team's history. A seemingly romantic reunion with Honda in 2015 – the squad's engine partner during the Prost/Senna years – quickly turned sour, leading to some challenging seasons for the outfit.

Following signs of progress amid a switch to Renault, the team went on to welcome a brand-new driver line-up in 2019 when Carlos Sainz joined with rookie Lando Norris. The duo's amiable relationship off the track made them a hit with fans, while their form on the circuit started to reap results.

After a P6 finish for McLaren in 2018, Sainz and Norris helped to elevate them to P4 one year on before going one step better to finish third in 2020, marking the squad's most successful championship placing in 10 years. And while the professional partnership ended when Sainz moved to Ferrari for 2021, the ‘Carlando' bromance appears to live on.

In a Sarajevo master class, the star passed on a question about Donald Trump, but discussed his collaborations with Martin Scorsese and others, and how he “did nothing” to prepare for ‘Wild at Heart.'


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


Willem Dafoe told a jam-packed master class at the 31st Sarajevo Film Festival on Thursday about his work with the likes of David Lynch, Martin Scorsese and Oliver Stone, among other things.


	The star, meanwhile, dodged a question about U.S. President Donald Trump. In an interview with Larry King at the dawning of the first Trump administration, Dafoe had shared that the country was “not going in the right direction.” Asked Thursday if he still felt that way, he simply replied: “If you know anything about me and you do, that's not a real question.”

	There were many other topics to discuss. ”I don't have that personality,” Dafoe said when asked if he could one day become a film director. “I like doing things. I like someone to say what they see, and then I like to try to embody it. I like doing things and embodying characters.… It challenges your perceptions, your prejudices.” As an actor, “you can act pretty mysteriously, even irresponsibly sometimes,” he added. “It's a beautiful way to play with testing your limitations.”

	Asked about playing the famous death scene in Oliver Stone's Platoon, Dafoe said “it is a moving scene,” lauding the music, editing and other collaborative work behind the scenes. “The way it was constructed was very simple. It wasn't really rehearsed,” Dafoe recalled. “I had a very simple task: run for my life.… And also I'm detonating bullet hits on me. So it's a pure technical task. It's like an athlete running from here to there. I'm not thinking about interpreting anything. I'm not thinking about the effect. I'm just trying to as gracefully and as clearly and as directly do this action.”

	











	Discussing starring in Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ, “I thought it was strange,” he recalled. As he learned more about its inspirations and focus, he agreed to take on the role.


	“This is a beautiful role, because [it's about] the human part of Jesus, and it's a guy that kind of rejects this responsibility given to him, and that was an interesting place to be, and it's one of my favorite roles, I guess, because it was so demanding, because I was almost in every shot, believe it or not, it was a very low-budget movie.” But that worked to the film's advantage, he argued. “There's a grace in its simplicity,” Dafoe said.


	“You are not THE Jesus Christ. You are one Jesus Christ,” he emphasized in explaining his approach to the role. The biggest challenge was “to free myself of any images and expectation” of and for Jesus Christ.


	Dafoe also said he was “shocked” about the backlash to the movie. “Jesus rejects his job and lives as a normal man. He has children, he has sex. That was too scandalous for people, so even without seeing the movie, there were huge protests against it,” the star recalled. “And then it morphed into a very strange thing about Jews in Hollywood. It became an antisemitic thing, and it snowballed. And the perception is that it was the Catholic Church. It really wasn't the Catholic Church. It was the fundamental right in America that started this, and then it spread to various places.”


	His reaction? “I was shocked, because in an age of super-violent movies and porn and all kinds of movies, this is a movie that was trying to address itself to the nature of faith,” Dafoe highlighted. “Yeah, it was a drag, because it was a movie that I was very invested in, in my mind. So it really did keep it from being widely distributed.”

	











	Marvel never has issues with distribution. “The original Spider-Man was a lot of fun because within a scene it could switch from very dramatic to very comic, which is very difficult to do,” Dafoe recalled. “It's got a great sense of humor, but it's not light.” 


	He also shared that he enjoys “doing the action stuff.” For the original Spider-Man, “you were still using wires,” Dafoe said. “There was less CGI, and it was fun because it's athletic.”


	The star is in the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina to receive the Honorary Heart of Sarajevo, “in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the art of film, and screen The Birthday Party. Stellan Skarsgard and Ray Winstone have also received the honor at the fest this year.


	Dafoe, who next has two films at Venice (Kent Jones' Late Fame and Gastón Solnicki's The Souffleur) and one at Toronto (The Man in My Basement, the feature debut of Nadia Latif), was greeted with a rousing ovation and excited waves from the master class crowd.


	Dafoe last was at the Sarajevo fest in 2000 with Steve Buscemi's Animal Factory. “I knew him when he was a fireman before he was an actor,” the star said about Buscemi. Also at the fest, he spent time with Mike Leigh, “who is a very charming guy once you get to know him,” Dafoe said to laughs.


	A financial question also came up. Money “is always a consideration,” but “I never remember what I get paid” and never “chase” money, the actor emphasized when asked about the role of money.

	











	Dafoe on Thursday also shared an anecdote about his father. “I liked him a lot, but he was quite conservative,” and he once told Dafoe: “I like that movie where you play the rapist,” meaning David Lynch's Wild at Heart. “That's probably funny, because my sweet father, you know, gets a kick out of me playing a really brutal criminal.”


	How was working with Lynch? “He wanted me to go to a dentist and get dentures” because his character Bobby Peru has rotten teeth, Dafoe recalled. “Actors do put limitations on themselves. I thought they would just color them, but no, he wanted me to go to the dentist and get dentures, dentures that went over my teeth. I went and got them, and the second I put them in my mouth, I couldn't close my mouth.… You feel different.”


	But Dafoe allowed that to impact the way he portrayed the character. “That became a trigger,” he explained. “That was such a lesson. Sometimes, an external thing really opens up something in your imagination that completes the character. And that was the beautiful thing between the writing and…the situation. All those things came together, and I was there to receive it. And I don't want to sound too spooky about it, but…that's a beautiful example of sometimes when you need to do research or a lot of work to prepare, you do. But for Bobby Peru, I did nothing, and it was just all the externals that kind of sent me on the way.”


	The film was the only collaboration with the legendary director who died earlier this year. ”David Lynch was very unconventional. He was an artist,” Dafoe shared. “He would not direct you conventionally. Very easy! Sometimes he'd say very abstract things, like, ‘Willem, you know, when you start this, you're kind of like green, and then you become brown.' I was good with that.”

	











	Having made over 150 films in his career, “Willem Dafoe is internationally respected for bringing versatility, boldness, and dare to some of the most iconic films of our time,” Sarajevo organizers said when unveiling him as a recipient of the honor.


	Jovan Marjanović, director of the Sarajevo fest, lauded Dafoe in recently unveiling his honor. “His body of work is something to which every actor aspires. Every time he steps in front of the camera, he demonstrates that he is a true master of his craft,” he said. “Whether starring in a Hollywood blockbuster or a low-budget independent film, his characters are always complex, emotional and unforgettable.”


	Dafoe has received four Academy Award nominations and won two Independent Spirit Awards, the Venice Film Festival Volpi Cup and a Berlinale Honorary Golden Bear for Lifetime Achievement.


	The 31st Sarajevo Film Festival runs through Friday, Aug. 22.

The actor who stars as Frank Reynolds on the FX comedy also shares his thoughts on the prospect of the show coming to an end after one more season: ""It would be hard to let go.""


							By 

	Brande Victorian



[This story contains spoilers from the season 17 finale of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.]


	In the Golden Bachelor spoof finale episode of season 17 of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Frank (Danny DeVito) steps outside of his customarily creepy character when he picks Sam, a seasoned contestant on the parodied reality dating show played by DeVito's former Taxi co-star Carol Kane, over 20-year-old Cock Chewa — a caricature of Haliey Welch, the originator of the viral “Hawk Tuah” street interview catchphrase — with whom he's been sleeping with on OnlyFans.

	The episode ends with Frank professing his love for Sam and offering her his gold rose, which she accepts, before the pair shares a passionate kiss in the rain. But according to It's Always Sunny star and executive producer Charlie Day, there could be more to the story.


	“I am sure we will write [Kane] into next season as well,” Day tells The Hollywood Reporter. “She seemed to have a lot of fun, so I would assume she would come back and do it, which would be great.”


	DeVito feels the same way about the prospect of Frank having an actual love life in the already renewed season 18 of the FX comedy. “I am way down with that,” the 80-year-old actor tells THR. “I mean, you get up there in age, it's nice to have a steady girlfriend.”

	











	Below, DeVito shares more thoughts on the future of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, which Day previously told THR could likely come to an end soon, the one storyline he (sort of) said no to since joining the show in its second season and partying with Michael Jackson in the ‘80s.


	***


In episode two this season, “Frank's in a Coma,” the Paddy's Pub crew thinks your character is in the hospital dying, but it turns out his body is really a cake. How do think that ranks among Frank's many fake-outs over the years?


	I don't know if I could speak to how it ranks… I look at the shows and I say, “Well, this is what we're doing in this season,” and just dive in. I don't compare 'em, but sometimes I watch things more than once — I had to see myself come out of the couch naked a few times — just because you can't believe you did it. (Laughs.)


In a 2019 interview on The Jonathan Show, you said there's pretty much nothing you'll say no to on It's Always Sunny. Has that held true? Can you recall anything that you've said no to over the years?


	We had one incident that was kind of a faux situation because — I didn't know it — but it was April 1st, and we were going to start shooting an episode that week. We were ready to go, and the morning of, I got a phone call and somebody said to me, “They're going to change up the first show, but they want you to read it before you come in.” They had all this planned, of course — the nut jobs I work with, who I love dearly — so I started reading [the script] and it was really, really bad. I was abused in this show to the point of, I can't even tell you. Midway through, I said, “I'm not going to do this. There's no way I can do this. This is really crazy.” 

	











	Long story short, the last line in the script, there are cops all around me with nightsticks, and they're all going to have their way with me in a jail. I say, “I'm leaving,” and the cop says, “You're not going to leave without saying goodbye, are you Frank?” And they all get their nightsticks in their hand, I get thrown down on the ground and I'm on my stomach and the guy leans down into my ear, and he says, “April Fools motherfucker,” (laughs) and I realized at that time that they had me totally wrapped around their little finger. I seriously was going to call my lawyer [and say], “Lawsuit, no way!”


Good thing it was just a prank.


	I got ‘em back. We all went to some Upfront thing in Washington, and it was a big hotel packed with TV people. I got there early, and we all had rooms that FX had given us on our own, so I talked to the manager, and I said, “Look, don't give them their rooms. Give me a small room with one bedroom and get me a bunch of cots and tell them that the place is filled.” The guy did it and he played it to the hilt. They were all in the room, and I was in a closet with a bottle of tequila and glasses watching them react to the fact that this guy is telling them there's no room in this hotel and this is the room that FX booked for them and they all had to sleep together on cots. Rob [Mac] got on the phone. He was going to call the big shots, and then I came out of the closet. I had 'em good.


They deserved it.


	They did deserve it.

	











What was your reaction to the season 17 script, including your Golden Bachelor storyline?


	Oh, I loved it. I loved everything. It's something that you don't want to miss, as an actor, the chance to do. And then we have incredible fans who constantly tattoo me on their butt and whatever, so I love it. It's been a hell of a ride.


How do you feel about the prospect of It's Always Sunny ending after one more season?


	Well, as long as we have a good ending — I don't know what the ending could be, they probably have one already figured out in their head. It would be hard to let go, but if it's right and the audience is happy with it, then I think it's a good thing to do. I had an experience like this with Taxi. We were canceled after four seasons by ABC, and Grant Tinker and Brandon Tartikoff [at NBC] picked us up for the fifth season [in 1982]. We did 22 shows that year, but prior to that, we didn't know. In fact, we'd all won Golden Globes and Emmys. I was in New York, all set to do Saturday Night Live, and we got the call. [Co-creator] Jim Brooks called us up, and we were devastated. We all got together and got drunk. I brought everybody on the show. Lorne Michaels was nice enough to let us on, but what I was getting at was we knew that that was going to be the last season [when we got picked up], so we all had it in our bones that we were doing the last episode. 


	But we were party animals anyway. Every Friday night we had a big party. It was really wild. For five years on Taxi, we worked from Monday to Friday. We did the show on Friday night, and then we had a party and everybody came to that party, from people who were on the sets of all the other shows, like Laverne & Shirley, Happy days — Henry Winkler used to come. We had people like John Belushi play at our wrap party. Michael Jackson was there. Michael loved our show. He used to come and watch in the booth up in the top where the technicians were. Robin [Williams] was there all the time, and we visited him too. But what I was getting at is, when Sunny comes to an end, we'll know it and we'll all embrace it. We really dig each other and we'll always work together.

From 'Hoop Dreams' to 'Bring It On,' 'Raging Bull' to 'Bull Durham' and beyond, THR's critics pick their all-time champs.



		By Daniel Fienberg, Jon Frosch, Angie Han, David Rooney, Leslie Felperin, Jordan Mintzer 

	August 21, 2025	




	It's rare that a sports movie is just a sports movie. 


	Through the prism of athletics, sports movies are love stories and tales of the underdog, opportunities to process war and addiction and immigration and euthanasia and economic inequality. They're showcases for our biggest stars, our pluckiest protagonists, our most virtuoso directors, and even the occasional golden retriever allowed on the court by a rule-book loophole. They reflect our complicated past and predict our dystopian future. They speak a language understood around the globe.


	For the purposes of this list, a panel of six THR critics started with an initial field of roughly 100 movies, whittling that number to 25 and then ranking them. Like sports themselves, the process provoked much passion and a bit of heartbreak. 


Baseball is our most represented sport, landing six spots on the list. Boxing and basketball had good showings, with five and four entries, respectively. Track, tennis, hockey, cheerleading, pool, cycling and skateboarding feature in our selections, too. A lone auteur, Ron Shelton, scored two slots — not entirely surprising given that he's a former minor-league infielder.


	As for the wealth of quality sports programming made for television — the likes of Pitch, Friday Night Lights and Welcome to Wrexham will have to wait for a list of their own.


	No less capable a filmmaker than Richard Linklater proved, with his lifeless 2005 remake, what an unlikely feat of alchemy this not-for-kids “kids movie” — about a Little League team of outcasts and misfits — truly was. The coach (Walter Matthau, masterfully callous and disheveled) is an alcoholic. The players flirt with racism, antisemitism and tobacco use. The lessons, though eventually warm and fuzzy, are buried in a subversive storyline. Director Michael Ritchie's confidence with the tricky tone is impeccable, and the casting, especially of the young actors (including Tatum O'Neal and Jackie Earle Haley), is top-notch. Plus, The Bad News Bears has an absolutely perfect ending — one of the best ever for a sports movie without reality to rely on. 


	By definition, sports are physical. Still, it's rare to see one as exhilarating in its physicality as this drama about the years-long bond among three elite tennis players, portrayed with playful sex appeal by Zendaya, Josh O'Connor and Mike Faist. Director Luca Guadagnino delights in the sight of bodies in motion: sweating, straining, brushing up against each other or pointedly not doing just that, as in a literally steamy sauna scene. In fact, it takes a beat to notice that the romantic scenes aren't actually that explicit; instead, Justin Kuritzkes' script draws the connection between the primal drives of sport and those of love and lust. “It's a relationship,” Zendaya's Tashi says of a recent match. “It's like we were in love, or like we didn't exist. We went somewhere really beautiful together.” Challengers gets you there without asking you to leave your seat. 


	Clint Eastwood's magisterial melodrama about a boxing trainer, his right-hand man and the female fighter they mentor coaxes sports movie conventions into something that feels miraculously one of a kind. Working from Paul Haggis' script based on a collection of stories by F.X. Toole, Eastwood nimbly jabs at themes of faith, mortality, guilt, poverty and salvation. But Million Dollar Baby is really about love — the unexpected bonds that tether us, what it means to care about someone, the counterintuitive forms that care can assume. The film lures you with the ticklish pleasure of watching an underdog's rise, then takes a swerve into darkness that would feel cheap if it weren't seen through with such shattering tenderness. Tom Stern's chiaroscuro cinematography and the wistful ache of Eastwood's score are indelible, but it's the performances that give this best picture Oscar winner its wounding force and purity. Hilary Swank locates a piercing sadness beneath her spunk, while Eastwood and Freeman pick at each other in a duet of sublimely cranky devotion. It's a movie about people with nothing to lose, made by an artist with nothing to prove. 


	Not every aspect of writer Nancy Dowd and director George Roy Hill's hockey comedy holds up under a 2025 gaze, particularly if you take the main characters' sexism and homophobia to represent the film's perspective. That would be a mistake. Slap Shot is a story of arrested development, of boorish antiheroes whose desperate desire to remain part of a disreputable game is embodied by a rarely better Paul Newman. When you have a star as boundlessly charismatic as Newman, you can push boundaries, and Slap Shot is uncouth by any standard. It's also exuberantly affectionate toward its central sport and its athletes, who are fighting — literally — to save their minor league team in their dying Rust Belt town. Because of its speed, brutality and regional specificity, hockey is one of the harder sports to bring to the screen, but Slap Shot reverberates with authenticity.


	In an era when pro sports teams have become the playthings of finance fat cats, Bennett Miller's film offers a thrilling true story of how one crafty baseball manager used the stats to take on the big guys. Based on Michael Lewis' best-selling account of Oakland A's frontman Billy Beane, who hired a young economist to turn his squad's shoestring budget into a stockpile of talent, the razor-sharp movie is less about heroics on the field than the guts and glory of the back office — about sports entering the Information Age. In one of his most vulnerable turns, Brad Pitt portrays Beane as an iconoclast with a gaping hole in his private life, while Jonah Hill winningly plays a polite number-cruncher who became the A's one-man brain trust. Together, their characters changed baseball history: for the better, in that teams with less money could finally compete with billion-dollar franchises; and for the worse, as algorithms have come to dominate America's favorite pastime. 


	The unsung champ of boxing movies, John Huston's downbeat fight flick follows an aging pugilist (Stacy Keach) trying to stage a comeback in Stockton, California. Adapting Leonard Gardner's unflinchingly realistic novel, Huston never shies away from the uglier sides of pro fighting, whether it's the way boxers old and young (the latter embodied by Jeff Bridges as a talented upstart) are constantly exploited or how the violence they dish out between the ropes often extends to their home lives. There are no winners in Fat City, even when someone knocks out their opponent. At best, there's the camaraderie of working-class warriors trying to stay afloat in the lower depths of America. 


Chinatown screenwriter Robert Towne made his directing debut with this drama, a way-ahead-of-its-time exploration of the price that sometimes must be paid to achieve athletic greatness. The relationship between track stars played by Mariel Hemingway (heartbreakingly innocent) and Patrice Donnelly (effectively unstudied) is handled with far more nuance than most LGBTQ+ storylines of the period, and Scott Glenn is creepily excellent as the demanding coach who comes between the two. But really setting the film apart is Towne and cinematographer Michael Chapman's eye — simultaneously prurient and reverential — for physicality. The movie is a symphony of twitching muscles and torquing limbs, an obsessed examination of the mechanics of excellence. 


	Before Caitlin Clark or Angel Reese, there was Monica Wright, played with graceful strength and disarming vulnerability by Sanaa Lathan. Like many films on this list, Gina Prince-Bythewood's drama is an impassioned portrait of athletic ambition. Like very few, it's a specifically Black and female spin on that theme, rooted in honesty about the challenges of making it as a female baller in a world that can seem awfully skeptical of them. It's also a top-notch romance, charting the long, rocky, magnetic connection between Monica and equally sports-obsessed boy next door Quincy (Omar Epps), and culminating in the sexiest one-on-one b-ball game ever put to film. Notably, Prince-Bythewood declines to make Monica sacrifice one of her great loves for the other. In her film, our heroine can have it all.


	Writer Angelo Pizzo and director David Anspaugh may not have created most of the archetypes that drive this story of a small-town Indiana high school basketball team's run to the state championship, but their film feels like the genre's ultimate blueprint. Gruff, demanding head coaches get no gruffer or more demanding than Gene Hackman's Norman Dale. Fragile, damaged wild cards get no more fragile and damaged than Dennis Hopper's Shooter. From Fred Murphy's location photography to the rousing score by Jerry Goldsmith, this is a gloriously earnest celebration of the overlooked human spirit — and a weaponized 105-minute countdown to a final five minutes guaranteed to make you cheer and cry. It works beautifully no matter how many times you've seen it or how many imitators you've sat through.


An intimate doc with the rippling textures of an epic narrative, this chronicle of the lives of three young Americans — one of whom is director Bing Liu — draws on more than a decade of footage. United by their love of skateboarding as an escape from their abusive homes in Rockford, Illinois, the friends forge paths to adulthood that all involve a painful reckoning with the past in a community where violence can become a generational legacy. The balletic shots of the trio on their boards performing ollies, heelflips and tailslides with effortless grace provide the background for an extraordinarily moving reflection on masculinity, class, race and economic disadvantage in 21st century America. Observed with rigorous emotional honesty, the film won the U.S. documentary special jury award for breakthrough filmmaking at Sundance in 2018 and was nominated for best documentary at the Oscars the next year. 


	When Paul Newman was offered the starring role in Robert Rossen's masterful pool-hall drama, he turned it down because of scheduling conflicts. Luckily Newman's other project fell apart, allowing him to deliver arguably the best performance of his career. As hotheaded “Fast Eddie” Nelson, the actor not only exuded a coolness worthy of Marlon Brando or James Dean, he plumbed the emotional depths of a solitary young man experiencing love and loss for the first time. Rossen lensed his movie in real New York City billiards joints and populated it with down-and-dirty pool sharks — including Jackie Gleason of The Honeymooners, who executed his own shots as legendary Minnesota Fats. But it's Piper Laurie who moves us the most, playing a lonely alcoholic holding herself together long enough to give Eddie the confidence he needs.


Jafar Panahi's tour de force comedy-drama takes place at a Tehran stadium, where Iran is playing Bahrain in a qualifying soccer match to decide which country goes to the 2006 World Cup. There's barely a glimpse of a ball or player, yet this may be one of the best films ever about fan passion and how love of the game can triumph over everything — perhaps, if only momentarily, even the repressions of patriarchy. We meet a gaggle of young women, all dressed as men, who've wrangled their way in to watch but have been arrested by soldiers and are being held in a makeshift pen at the back of the park. The comic tone mitigates the threat of the impending trip to the police station, and the stakes don't feel as high as they would years later when the anti-hijab protests broke out. Still, the bravery of these women, and filmmakers, is painfully palpable and inspiring to this day. 


	Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck's exquisitely sensitive portrait of a Dominican pitcher (Algenis Perez Soto) struggling to make the leap to the majors from a minor-league club in Iowa is a corrective to all the glory-drunk narratives of athletic success out there. Examining the cold, hard realities that await most aspirants to the top tier of U.S. baseball, it's also a great immigration film, capturing the lonely disorientation of pursuing such dreams when everything from diner menus to local church culture seems indecipherable. The baseball scenes are tense, though it's off the field that the story's meaning blossoms. An undertow of anxious melancholy intensifies, culminating in an NYC-set chapter at once crushing and restorative as it observes the protagonist trying to find purpose away from the diamond. You've heard Leonard Cohen's “Hallelujah” in movies and shows before, but never as stirringly as it's used here — a gorgeous Spanish cover by Chilean artist GEPE — in the penultimate moments of this stealthy stunner.


	The hard-knocks playgrounds of Venice Beach and other parts of L.A. are the setting for Ron Shelton's streetball classic in which Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes play trash-talking hustlers who team up to make fast money. The actors trained under NBA Hall of Famer Bob Lanier, and their b-ball skills are on display in a movie that captures the gritty feel of real pickup games. But this isn't just a supremely entertaining sports flick — it's a tragicomic bromance filled with catchy one-liners and tête-à-têtes, with Rosie Perez memorably playing a girlfriend who turns out to be more of a hustler than anyone. The film bristles with racial tensions defused via humorous ribbing and riffing, while the story goes on to illustrate that all men truly are created equal once they step on the court. 


	As the oft-repeated quote goes, “There's no crying in baseball.” But even the most seasoned fan might find it hard not to get a little choked up watching Penny Marshall's fierce, funny, moving classic about the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, a short-lived midcentury relic best known today through this very film. While Tom Hanks and Geena Davis anchor the cast as the cantankerous manager and the composed star catcher, respectively, it's the entire ensemble (Lori Petty! Rosie O'Donnell! Freaking Madonna!) that gives this movie its irresistible heart. Together, they deliver an unforgettably charming celebration of the transportive and transformative potential of sports: the thrill of playing and watching them; the lifelong connections made within them; and the possibilities they can open for people.


	The Brits have a saying, “It's grim up North,” which would perfectly sum up Tony Richardson's kitchen-sink classic if the film weren't also so deeply infused with humor and cheeky defiance. Tom Courtenay, endearingly surly and callow, stars as Colin, a kid from a Nottingham council estate who's sentenced to a juvenile hall for thievery. The governor (Michael Redgrave) spots Colin's talent for running, honed over years of high-tailing it from the law, and thinks the boy could win a race against some posh kids — or even become an Olympian. What's so memorably great here — apart from the acting, cutting dialogue by Alan Sillitoe (adapting his own short story) and playful New Wave-inflected editing — is the film's profoundly antiheroic spirit; it's a very English two-finger salute to the establishment.


	We may get some flak for ranking this classic teen-com about competitive cheerleading so high. But the delightful Kirsten Dunst vehicle stands up remarkably well; it even seems prescient in the respect it pays to cheerleading, a hot topic ever since Netflix's docuseries Cheer threw a spotlight on how hard squad members train. Part of the delicious joke here is that the competition-topping high school squad Dunst's Torrance leads is way more talented than the oafish football players they're supporting. That said, Torrance's Toros don't have the style of the Compton Clovers (led by a luminous Gabrielle Union), whose hip-hop-inflected routines the Toros have been ripping off for years. Like the best femme-skewed teen films of this vintage, Bring It On strikes just the right balance between earnestness and snark, especially in the slam poetry of the cheers themselves. The movie also makes sharp points about cultural appropriation and white fragility without even using those phrases. 


	Eyes rolled when John G. Avildsen's inspirational boxing drama won the best picture Oscar over the likes of Taxi Driver, All the President's Men and Network. But the vehicle that made Sylvester Stallone a superstar — launching a string of sequels as well as a franchise of Creed spinoffs — has earned its enduring place in the pop-culture lexicon. Rocky Balboa, blinded by swollen eyelids at the end of a punishing fight, yelling “Adrian!” to his shy sweetheart in the crowd (beautifully played by Talia Shire) is as famous as Stanley Kowalski yelling “Stella!” in A Streetcar Named Desire. And there are few more iconic images of the underdog spirit than Rocky jogging up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art in a training montage. As crowd-pleasers go, this rags-to-riches American dream story is as formulaic as they make 'em, but also as moving. Ask anyone to identify the opening bars of Bill Conti's theme music; you won't get many wrong answers.


	One of the greatest of all baseball films, John Sayles' superb adaptation of Eliot Asinof's 1963 book about the scandal surrounding the 1919 Chicago White Sox culls from a story so rich and sweeping it could easily fill an eight-part limited series. The movie brilliantly captures the friction of a sport at the tipping point between youthful idealism and corporatized commodification, delivering a pragmatic examination of the players' motivations as well as a beautiful evocation of the post-Great War historical moment. Sayles, who's also perfectly cast as sports journalist Ring Lardner, assembled one of his finest casts, with standouts including D.B. Sweeney as a guileless “Shoeless” Joe Jackson, David Strathairn as weary hurler Eddie Cicotte and John Cusack and Charlie Sheen as other members of that notorious team. 


	Playwright, novelist and screenwriter Steve Tesich saw six of his scripts become major films before his death in 1996, including an adaptation of The World According to Garp, a John Irving novel widely considered unfilmable. But Tesich's Oscar-winning debut screenplay was his best, a deeply felt coming-of-age comedy-drama inspired by the writer's time on a college cycling team in Bloomington, Indiana. A small-scale production with no marquee names (Dennis Quaid was still a newcomer, while Daniel Stern was making his screen debut), Peter Yates' feature told a resonant story of blue-collar townies belittled by affluent frat-boy jocks. Dennis Christopher goes from insouciant humor to heartbreaking disillusionment as Dave Stohler, a former stonecutter's son obsessed with Italian bicycle racing until he's rudely awakened by firsthand experience of his idols' tactics. In true uplifting, triumph-over-adversity sports film fashion, he bounces back in this funny, unpretentious and poignant jewel of a film, further elevated by wonderful turns from Barbara Barrie and Paul Dooley as Dave's parents. 


	Although Ezra Edelman's dazzlingly rich five-part doc about the rise and fall of O.J. Simpson was produced for TV under ESPN's 30 for 30 banner, it took the unconventional path of carving out a theatrical release in order to be nominated for, and eventually win, both Emmys and an Oscar. That's a function of strange eligibility wrinkles, but also of the utter excellence of the project, perhaps the definitive examination of the intersection of race, sports and celebrity in 20th century America. Edelman's treatment of Simpson's high-profile murder trial is terrific, but it's ultimately just a small part of a tapestry of tragedy that the director ties to the Great Migration, the history of policing in Los Angeles, the rise of football as our most lucrative sport and much, much more.


	A relic from a time when Hollywood made sexy movies for grown-ups, Ron Shelton's romantic comedy might be the only entry on this list that's as much about a sports groupie as the sport itself. Emanating magnetism that ought to be illegal, Susan Sarandon stars as Annie Savoy, a self-appointed spiritual guru to North Carolina's Durham Bulls, opposite Kevin Costner as “Crash” Davis, a seasoned player brought in as a catcher to instill control in the team's hotshot rookie pitcher. That would be “Nuke” Laloosh, played by Tim Robbins with a hilarious mix of naivete and cockiness. Annie chooses him as her lover and recipient of her wisdom. But as Nuke acquires maturity on the field through Crash's prickly mentorship, the attraction between the catcher and Annie becomes impossible to ignore. Sure, Nuke has a “million-dollar arm,” but can he dexterously unsnap a garter belt, paint a woman's toenails or cause the furniture to rattle during sex? The movie's love for America's national pastime is matched by its insightfulness about relationships.


	A case could be made that if you truly value the sports in sports movies, then nothing beats documentaries: That's where you really see the talent, skills and grace that make great athletes worth watching; actors (with assists from editing and direction) can only approximate. When We Were Kings proves the point. There can be no substitute for the footage of the historic 1974 fight in Zaire, the so-called Rumble in the Jungle, where two titans — then-undefeated George Foreman and Muhammad Ali, a former champ still called The Greatest but considered past his prime — slugged it out on live TV. Director Leon Gast's doc, 22 years in the making, is a celebration of these boxers' prowess. Interviewed eyewitnesses include Norman Mailer and George Plimpton, who analyze the men's strengths and strategies with expertise you don't often hear outside sports commentary. But this face-off was about so much else: politics on macro and micro levels, the discourse around race in 1974 (which Spike Lee perspicaciously dissects), idealism and capitalism. The material is phenomenal, so it's a good thing the filmmaking is up to the task — especially the editing, which adds a sizzle as succulent as a steak on a George Foreman grill.


	When Steve James' incomparable three-hour basketball documentary hit theaters in 1994, it was something of a bombshell. Not only did the movie offer up a rare inside look at two young inner-city ballers struggling to make it at a moment when NBA players were turning into global superstars; it did so over the course of four years, meticulously chronicling the teens through the ups and downs they faced on and off the court — especially as kids hailing from Chicago's notoriously rough Cabrini-Green projects. At once compassionate and unwavering in its depiction of raw talent and dashed hopes, Hoop Dreams set the tone for the kind of sociological sports docs (Last Chance U, etc.) now popular on streaming. It also revealed a truth so many aspiring hoopers must face: Not everyone can be the next Michael Jordan. In fact, some of the very best will never make it to the pros. 


	Martin Scorsese's boxing masterpiece is many things: a knockout drama of raw violence and shattered dreams; a midcentury chronicle that takes us from the Bronx to Miami and back again; a real-life tale of family bonds torn apart by money, corruption and testosterone; and a redemption story in which redemption never arrives. After trying his hand at a musical (New York, New York), a rock doc (The Last Waltz), a small-time gangster flick (Mean Streets), a heartland drama (Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore) and a portrait of urban psychosis (Taxi Driver), Scorsese landed on the perfect genre to make his very best movie — one that brilliantly shifts between lyricism and realism to tell a story of athletic greatness marred by deep inner anguish. 


	Ironically, this wasn't even a film the director wanted to shoot. He turned down the project — brought to him by Robert De Niro, who had the rights to Jake LaMotta's biography — several times, convinced he couldn't pull off a boxing movie. But after his own fall from grace, including surviving a drug overdose, Scorsese saw a part of himself in LaMotta's tragic life, while De Niro sensed the role could be one of his greatest, which it was. All the titles on our list are more than just great sports flicks, but this one is personal filmmaking at its most glorious.

The teaser for the upcoming, in-production episodes, premiering in January, confirms the return of Katherine LaNasa's charge nurse Dana and Patrick Ball's Dr. Langdon.


							By 

	Hilary Lewis


Deputy Editor, East Coast


HBO Max has released the first footage from The Pitt season two via a teaser trailer showing some of the emergencies and characters treating them that viewers can expect on the Max original's July 4th weekend-set second installment.


	The preview confirms the return of Katherine LaNasa's charge nurse Dana Evans, shown sharing a look with Noah Wyle‘s Dr. Michael “Robby” Robinavitch, after she said at the end of a grueling 15-hour day in season one that she was quitting. Fellow beleagured character Dr. Langdon (Patrick Ball), who Robby kicked out of the emergency room in season one after he discovered the physician was hiding that he had been using drugs, is also shown returning and looking around the hospital.

	The preview also features a quick glimpse of new emergency attending physician Dr. Al-Hashimi, played by Sepideh Moafi, anxiously watching a procedure with Robby, and returning castmembers Supriya Ganesh (Dr. Mohan), Fiona Dourif (Dr. McKay), Taylor Dearden (Dr. King), Isa Briones (Dr. Santos), Gerran Howell (Whitaker) and Shabana Azeez (Javadi). 


	In addition to Moafi, it was previously announced that Charles Baker, Irene Choi, Laetitia Holland and Lucas Iverson will appear in season two in recurring roles.


	The clip begins with Robby walking into the ER, footage that seems reminiscent of the first-look photo released when production on season two began earlier this summer.

	











	Another character at the desk, with Dana, says “the prodigal son returns.”


	After brief glimpses of traumas, a patient struggling with restraints in an ambulance and a voiceover announcing a “tier one trauma ETA six minutes,” Robby is shown saying, “And so it begins.”


	The compilation of rapid-fire clips also features police officers running through the halls, a baby squirming and a cast being cut off.


	It ends on a lighter note as a nurse wonders aloud to Dr. Santos if they “do this every day.”


	“If we're lucky,” she says.


	Though there's no specific release date for season two, which appears to still be in production, HBO Max says it will return in January.


	It was previously revealed that season two of The Pitt would take place 10 months after season one, over the July 4 weekend, giving Robby and the other characters some time to deal with the issues that emerged from the mass shooting and other incidents that took place in season one.


	“When we come back a lot of story has transpired between our characters, and so we get a chance to catch up, whereas if we'd done the next day, everyone would still just be dealing with their PTSD and the grief about it, so we wouldn't have as much story to tell,” creator and showrunner R. Scott Gemmill previously told The Hollywood Reporter. “And this just seemed like the best way to re-engage the audience and let them play a little bit of catch-up as they probably see some new faces.”

	











	Beyond that, Gemmill teased of the July 4 time period, “There's a holiday; there's lots going on in the city, a lot of unique things to summertime that bring you into the ER, so we can tap into those with whatever we decide to do.”


	And the summer setting was also born out of a practical concern, Gemmill said, since the series' exterior filming happens in September.


	Though LaNasa's future on the show was up in the air at the end of season one, Wyle was jokingly noncommital and highlighted her importance to the series.


	“Fan favorite Katherine LaNasa not come back? Come on now,” he told THR the week The Pitt‘s season one finale aired in April. “But, yeah, it happens. Who knows? Who knows?”


	And he said that Robby also doesn't want to “entertain a universe where she doesn't come back.”


	After Robby suffers a meltdown near the end of season one, Wyle and Gemmill have teased that the second season will feature him seeking treatment for his own trauma as well as a larger “journey of healing,” as Gemmill put it.


	“I think the best thing that could have happened to his character was the meltdown, because until then, he wasn't dealing with it,” Gemmill said. “If no one had seen the meltdown, he could probably go back to his own ways, which is again, denial and avoidance. But because Whitaker saw him, and then ultimately we learned that somebody else saw him, so that even Langdon knows about it, so at that point, Robby knows his secret is out and realizes that he has to come to terms and deal with this and part of this second season will be about seeing Robby and what steps he's taking to deal with his past trauma, and even the most recent, the mass shooting, but part of it is his journey of healing.”

	











	Wyle added, “So it's really a question for season two: problem identified, season two treatment. Whether or not he buys into it, what mode he would buy into, what effect it would take — doctors don't make the best patients. They're really better at diagnosing problems. And we're going to have a couple of doctors coming back and having to grapple with not only — Robby's got [his mentor Dr.] Adamson [who died five years earlier during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic], but now everybody's got Pitt Fest, so to a degree, everybody's got an Adamson that they're gonna have to contend with. So how he goes about getting help, how we depict a physician seeking or accepting treatment, how the rest of our practitioners, who've now been through this crazy experience, digest it and synthesize it in their own lives and careers, is going to be a big focus of season two.”


The Pitt, which racked up 13 Emmy nominations for its first season, is executive produced by Gemmill, Wyle, John Wells, Michael Hissrich, Erin Jontow and Simran Baidwan.

Fox is launching a new streaming service Thursday that it hopes does not cannibalize its cable numbers, but reaches other sports and news fans. 


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


	Fox is launching a new streaming service, while also trying not to cannibalize its large cable audience.


	The company is launching Fox One Thursday, which will bring the company's live news programming, sports and entertainment together in one streaming app. In October, it will also offer Fox One consumers the option to bundle with ESPN's new direct-to-consumer app, which also launches Thursday. 




	Fox One is launching at a price of $19.99 a month, or $39.99 for the bundle with the new ESPN streaming app, which will launch Oct. 2. Cable and pay TV subscribers can also authenticate into the app. Subscribers can also add in Fox Nation, Fox's existing streaming service that includes original shows from Fox News hosts, docuseries and more, and documentary-style programs featuring Fox News personalities for an extra fee.

					Fox Ad Revenue Rises, Driven by Tubi and Fox News		
			









	But as for exactly how big that non-cable audience is for Fox's new streamer? They're not sure yet. 


	“We know there's an appetite out there for cord cutters and cord nevers for our news products,” Pete Distad, CEO of Fox One, said in a media presentation last week, pointing to the high viewership of news content on YouTube and elsewhere. 


	“We've got a bunch of hypotheses on what the overlap will be with all the bundling that's occurring out there in the market,” Distad said of sports fans, adding they don't know the exact numbers the streamer will hit. 


	Distad did point to Fox's CEO Lachlan Murdoch's goal of reaching single to mid-single digit millions on the streaming service over the next few years, adding that he's hopeful Fox One will hit those numbers more quickly. The greater focus, however, will be on making the streamer profitable and leveraging the content they already have. 

	











	“We're not going to go out and spend billions of dollars on digital programming specifically for this platform. We already spend billions of dollars on programming for our ecosystem which includes cable, broadcast, digital. We're just extending that now,” Distad said. 


	To better cater to whatever audience it does draw, Fox One is launching with personalized homepages that display the type of content the subscriber is most interested in, after an on-boarding process and interactions with the platform. For sports fans, that includes live scores on the home page and the option to catch up on important games with highlights up to that point, or to rewatch the full game, a condensed version of the game or a quick recap. 


	Live content, which is the main focus of the streamer, will be front and center on the homepage and sorted based on the interest of the subscriber.


	On mobile, the app is also leaning into short-form content and running all of its content through a video content intelligence layer to create shorts across all genres.


	The streamer will also have podcasts at launch. Fox is working with Red Seat Ventures, the podcasting studio it acquired in February, to identify specific shows to feature. 


	The launch of the streaming platform comes after the failed launch of Venu, the sports-focused streaming service founded by Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox that dissolved in January after legal threats from competitors. 


	With whatever upside it brings, Murdoch noted at an investor conference in March, the goal is not to eat into the company's cable revenue. 

	











	“We think the traditional cable bundle has been the greatest value and service to consumers in this country, and it continues to be a critical and important part of our revenue makeup and how we distribute, how we get our content in front of all of our viewers,” Murdoch said. “Having said that, as you know, more and more people are outside of the bundle.”


	Disney has been walking a similar line with the launch of its new ESPN app, which is also aimed at its non-cable audience. The company is also pushing consumers toward a bundled option with Hulu and Disney+ and offering the option to view content within Disney+ or on the separate app. 


	“If they choose to be reached through the ESPN app, great. If they choose to be reached through the Disney+ Hulu app, great. If they choose to be reached through cable, great,” Hugh Johnston, Disney's CFO said about consumers in the company's recent earnings call.

	The TV series that debuted in Nov. 1995 telling the story of the Fab Four in their own words and through archival footage and performances has been restored, remastered and expanded with a new ninth episode featuring previously unseen, behind-the-scenes footage of Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr coming together in 1994-1995 (minus the late John Lennon) to work on the project, as well as reflecting on their lives in the band.

	The Anthology music collection will also be restored and expanded to four volumes spread across 12 vinyl LPs and eight CDs. The collection originally curated by “fifth Beatle” longtime producer/arranger George Martin — and remastered by his son, producer Giles Martin — will add Anthology 4, which includes 13 previously unreleased demos and session recordings and other rarities overseen by Giles. In addition, it will add new mixes of the Anthology-related “new” singles “Free As a Bird” and “Real Love,” refreshed by original producer ELO's Jeff Lynne using “de-mixed” Lennon vocals.


	Both new mixes will appear alongside the band's 2023 Grammy-winning U.K. No. 1 single “Now and Then,” which has been described as the last-ever Beatles song. The full Anthology project, due out Nov. 21, will feature 191 songs available for digital purchase and streaming, as well as in physical formats. Both physical box sets will include the original sleeve notes for Anthology 1, 2 and 3, with Anthology 4 featuring track notes by BBC producer and author Kevin Howlett and an introduction compiled from 1996 interviews recorded with Beatles close friend and advisor Derek Taylor.


	In addition, the “Free As a Bird” music video has been restored as part of the effort (watch it here).


	There will also be a 25th anniversary edition of the 368-page The Beatles Anthology book. Due out on Oct. 14 through Apple Corps. Ltd. and Chronicle Books, it will feature “honest, intimate and revelatory” recollections from John, Paul, George and Ringo, as well as insights from close friends and colleagues Neil Aspinall, Martin, Taylor and others. The book features more than 1,300 photos, documents, artwork and other memorabilia from the band's archives.

A new chapter begins at the HYBE-owned label.


													By
												

	Billboard Korea



ADOR, the HYBE-owned label behind K-pop powerhouse NewJeans, has appointed Lee Do-kyung as its new CEO.


	The appointment comes just a year after Kim Ju-young, formerly HYBE's chief personnel officer, took over as ADOR CEO following the departure of Min Hee-jin in August last year.


	ADOR's board stated that under Kim Ju-young's leadership, the company successfully stabilized its organizational and management structure. With that milestone reached, the board appointed a new CEO to transition into a more agile operating model — one designed to better support artist activities and accelerate business initiatives.


	Lee Do-kyung, ADOR's newly appointed CEO, joined the company in 2019, when HYBE was still operating under its former name, Big Hit Entertainment. Since then, she has spearheaded a range of new business ventures and most recently served as Vice President of the IPX Business Division, which oversees artist IP-driven projects such as merchandise and pop-up stores.


	The leadership change comes amid ongoing tensions between ADOR and NewJeans regarding their exclusive contract. With a second round of mediation set for early September, industry observers are closely watching to see whether the appointment of a new CEO could help bridge the gap between the two sides. Reflecting the heightened public interest, nearly 100 domestic media outlets reported on the CEO transition within 24 hours of ADOR's press release on August 20.

	Meanwhile, ADOR has also announced plans to launch a new boy group and is currently holding auditions.

	The Modfather had been a client of Harris and Trotter LLP for more than 30 years until he was notified that they could no longer act for him because they were “offended” by his publicly expressed views of Israel committing genocide in Gaza, according to a statement from Hodge Jones & Allen, which is representing Weller.

	Weller has instructed the law firm to take action against the accountancy specialists and business advisors for “discrimination” against him over his “protected philosophical beliefs” concerning the rights of the Palestinian people.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The case will be a test of the UK's Equality Act 2010, which applies to discrimination in the provision of any services, the result of which could have “wider implications that move beyond the music industry,” reads a message from Hodge Jones & Allen.




	“I've always spoken out against injustice, whether it's apartheid, ethnic cleansing, or genocide. What's happening to the Palestinian people in Gaza is a humanitarian catastrophe,” Weller explains.


	“I believe they have the right to self-determination, dignity, and protection under international law, and I believe Israel is committing genocide against them. That must be called out. Silencing those who speak this truth is not just censorship – it's complicity.


	“I'm taking legal action not just for myself, but to help ensure that others are not similarly punished for expressing their beliefs about the rights of the Palestinian people. No one should face discrimination for speaking out against the atrocities that the people of Gaza are being subjected to.”


	Weller's pre-action letter to his former accountants requests details of other cases in which they have terminated or refused to take on clients for similar reasons.


	The former Jam and Style Council frontman was reportedly sent a WhatsApp message in March, in which his accountants resigned with immediate effect. Hodge Jones & Allen shared some of that note. “Everyone is entitled to their own views,” it reads, “but you are alleging such anti-Israel views that we as a firm with Jewish roots and many Jewish partners are not prepared to work with someone who holds these views.”


	Weller's “treatment reflects a wider pattern of attempts to silence artists and public figures who speak out in support of Palestinian rights,” comments Cormac McDonough, a civil liberties partner at Hodge Jones & Allen. “Within the music industry especially, we are seeing increasing efforts to marginalize those who express solidarity with the people of Gaza. The Equality Act was designed to protect individuals from discrimination, including based on philosophical belief, and it is essential that those protections are upheld in practice.”

	











	Weller was a signatory to a public letter defending the Irish rap outfit Kneecap, which faced calls for criminal charges for shouting “Free Palestine” and “‘F— Keir Starmer” during its politically-charged set at 2025 Glastonbury Festival.


	Also, the former Jam and Style Council frontman has top billing for the sold-out Gig for Gaza, to be staged October 17th at Troxy in London.


	The legal situation emerges just weeks after the release of Weller's Find El Dorado, a 15-track collection of covers, including songs originally recorded by the Bee Gees, The Kinks, Richie Havens, Christy Moore, The Flying Burrito Brothers, and more. The LP is one of Weller's 29 solo Top 40 appearances on the Official UK Albums Chart, a tally that includes six leaders. 


	Weller has pledged to donate any damages awarded or received in settlement of his claim to humanitarian relief efforts in Gaza. H&T, winners of Accounting Firm of the Year at the 2023 Music Week Awards, has yet to respond to Weller's lawsuit.

The Dallas native teams with Luke Combs, Jelly Roll, Shaboozey & more on the album that arrives Friday.

	Gail Mitchell



	When BigXthaPlug took Billboard out for barbecue in Los Angeles, the rapper — and self-confessed “ribs guy” — opted for the smoked links at Max City BBQ. While sampling those links (and a surprise addition of ribs from the establishment), the Dallas native talked about how solitary confinement during a jail stint helped spark his career.

	











	Imprisoned after violating probation, the then-20-year-old was locked up on his son's 1st birthday. “It took a toll on me,” BigX recalls, “and made me very emotional. So they [jail officials] had to confine me by myself. And in that confinement, I felt like I was losing myself mentally.”


	Asking fellow inmates how they maintained their mental health, BigX parlayed one suggestion to write poetry into writing rap verses, which he did on medical forms since regular sheets of paper weren't available. After completing the jail term, he says, “I wasn't planning to be a rapper.” But in pledging to his autistic son Amar that “you'll never not be with me ever again,” he began thinking about what he could do “to still be here for your child and still provide.”


	Fast-forward to 2025. In the aftermath of several platinum and gold-certified hit singles, including “Texas,” “Mmhmm” and “The Largest” — plus the 2023 gold album Amar and 2024's platinum Take Care — BigXthaPlug is busy promoting his third album, I Hope You're Happy. Ahead of its release, the rapper — and now father as well to toddler daughter Leilani — received the Innovator Award at Billboard's Country Power Players 2025.












	Arriving Friday, the anticipated UnitedMasters release finds the rapper delving into his love of country music. In addition to the Hot 100 (No. 4) and Hot Country Songs (No. 1) hit “All the Way” with Bailey Zimmerman, the 11-track album features notable pairings with, among others, Jelly Roll (“Box Me Up”), Shaboozey (“Home”), Luke Combs (“Pray Hard”), Ella Langley (“Hell at Night) and Ink (“24/7”), the latter of whom co-wrote “Texas Hold ‘Em” and “American Requiem” for Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter.


	Watch the latest installment of Billboard's Takes Us Out series with BigXthaPlug, as he talks more about the album (whose emotional themes stemmed from a breakup), his collaborators  — including those who didn't make the album — plus the joy of being a dad and his prediction for the 2025-26 football season.

	Apple TV+ is hiking the monthly price of its service to $12.99 from $9.99 effective today for new customers. Existing subscribers will be topped off in their next renewal.


	The streamer, home to original series The Morning Show, Ted Lasso, Slow Horses and Severance – the latter recently nabbing an impressive 23 Emmy nominations — is the only major service to eschew an advertising-supported option. 


	Its annual rate of $99.99 is unchanged. 


	This is the first price hike for Apple TV+ since a previous $3 increase in October of 2023.

Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company was thrilled with F1 and with a record 81 Emmy noms overall, saying on a recent call with Wall Streeters that “It's amazing to see how this and other Apple shows have captured the popular imagination.”


	The company doesn't provide subscribers numbers for Apple TV+, which sits within Apple's giant Services division that includes the App Store, Apple Pay, music, gaming, health and subscription platforms, to name a few. Cook cited “very positive trends” in the June quarter saying Apple TV+ was up “strong double digits” on the strength of its original content.

Nobody outside of LA and NY even watches Apple. Which is a shame because they are putting out great content. But this price hike is absurd. They're already the lowest viewed streamer.

Netflix did this bit by bit and now it's 17.99 a month. Shameless

I bhope they finally put on some ecent comedies other than Ted Lasso.

I'm old enough to remember when it was 4.99. five years ago.

Game of Thrones star Kristian Nairn has been forced to withdraw from Strictly Come Dancing before the BBC dance show has even got underway.


	Nairn, who played Hodor in HBO's fantasy franchise, has had to quit the UK's version of Dancing With The Stars for medical reasons. His casting was only announced last week.


	In a statement, the actor said: “With a heavy heart, I have to step back from this season of Strictly Come Dancing due to unexpected medical reasons. I was truly looking forward to the journey, and I'm deeply sorry to disappoint anyone who was looking forward to seeing me on the dance floor. Thank you all for your support, and I will be back on my feet very soon, in every sense.”

	











Strictly executive producer Sarah James said: “We've absolutely loved getting to know Kristian in this short time, and he has all the makings of a brilliant Strictly Come Dancing contestant. We're incredibly sorry to lose him from this year's series and we all wish him a speedy recovery.”

	Nairn's other roles include playing Wee John Feeney in two seasons of the HBO comedy Our Flag Means Death. He is also a house DJ, having worked alongside Steve Aoki, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Fatboy Slim, and Danny Howard.

EXCLUSIVE: Spawn of the Living Dead, written by John A. Russo, co-creator of the seminal horror classic Night Of The Living Dead, is moving ahead with attached cast including Casper Van Dien (Stormship Troopers), Bill Moseley (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2), Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes), Kane Hodder (Friday 13th franchise), along with 70's Bond girl Trina Parks (Diamonds Are Forever).


	Producer Nuala Quinn-Barton, Mania Entertainment and The Film Co-Operative have signed musician, actor and director Ani Kyd Wolf to helm this movie and another genre feature: Organism 46-B The Unseen, written by author Ted Lazaris.

	Quinn-Barton is aiming to shoot both low-budget films in early 2026 at Lumostage Studios in Vancouver with the same lineup of actors also attached for Organism 46-B The Unseen. Quinn-Barton is independently financing the projects through equity connections, she told us.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Also working on both will be veteran makeup and FX designer Todd Masters (True Bloods), who will design the zombies in Spawn of the Living Dead and craft the Antarctic creature at the heart of Organism 46-B.


Spawn of the Living Dead kicks off with the following premise: “The 1968 zombie plague is ending. The living dead, eaters of human flesh who are lurking in the Evans City Cemetery, are being gunned down and burned by an armed posse led by Sheriff Ken Johnson and Deputy Jeff Sanders. Dr. Harold Ormsby is also on the scene with a team of white-coated laboratory assistants, collecting zombie specimens by shooting them with immobilizing darts, the same way wild animals are captured for zoos. Their mission is to carry out experiments on the undead in hopes of finding out what caused the plague and how it can be cured.”


	The synopsis for Organism 46-B reads: “Trapped beneath four kilometers of Antarctic ice, scientists awaken an ancient predator, a shape-shifting horror who mimics its prey and controls the mind. Paranoia sets in, survival is now not just about escape…but knowing who to trust”.

	











	“With the landscape of uncertainty in the film world, I feel that the future is made for indie filmmakers. We are working with brilliant horror legends in two different styled films, shooting them back-to-back. I am excited for this challenge,” said director Ani Kyd Wolf.


	“I am delighted to be a part of bringing these films to life alongside director Ani Kyd Wolf and some of the most wonderful creatives in the horror genre. It is especially exciting to be able to shoot in Canada, with their attractive tax incentives, and utilize the state-of-the-art facilities at the celebrated Lumostage Studios in Vancouver,” added Nuala Quinn-Barton.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Golden Bachelor Frank Reynolds takes over Sunny's (relatively) tender season finale","https://www.avclub.com/its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia-season-17-finale-recap","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 02:30:00 GMT","

The finale of the 17th season of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia does something subversively funny: While spoofing ABC's The Golden Bachelor, it stages a reunion that would appeal most to the age demo of actual contestants from the show. For those of us old enough to remember classic comedies, seeing Danny DeVito and Carol Kane together again on TV allows for flashbacks to the wonderful Taxi, in which the two first appeared together way back in 1980. Apparently, the Taxi crew has stayed in touch in the four-decades-plus since that appearance, even assembling via Zoom during COVID, and Kane told People she was still “very close” with DeVito. It's tempting to ask what took so long to get these legends back together on Sunny, but it works so well here that it feels worth the wait. Somehow their friendship comes through in the show, sliding back into the comic chemistry they honed so many years ago. 

Kane plays Samantha, a contestant on The Golden Bachelor, starring Frank Reynolds. Last week's “The Gang Gets Ready For Primetime” saw the Paddy's crew miserably preparing for the hometown dates that would bring Jesse Palmer and ABC cameras to Philly, only to discover that Frank hired actors to play his family instead. 

“The Golden Bachelor Live” opens with a very-game Palmer commenting on how Frank Reynolds may have been more “eccentric” than any previous contestant in Bachelor history but that he “won our hearts.” How did he pull that off? With amazing bon mots like “I can't wait to find a grade-A prime cut piece of ass…to love.”

Cut to the classic Bachelor premiere sequence of arrivals at the mansion, for which Frank “dropped a couple bluies” to make sure he's ready. Of course, horndog Frank misunderstood the concept of the dating show, presuming he wouldn't have to date sexagenarians. He passes on Lisa (67), Kathryn (62), and Judy (69) before they can even say a word, uttering some crude material about crackling body parts that would never make it on ABC. Perpetually horny Frank threatens to leave if the producers don't contact TikTok superstar Cock Chewa (Audrey Corsa) to be the one who gets his rose and his current STDs. Her catchphrase? “Chew on that thang,” followed by a sound that can only be called upsetting given the context of, well, that thang.

The Hawk Tuah riff gets a little tired, but writers Charlie Day and Rob Mac counter that influencer comedy with the wonderful Carol Kane, who joins The Golden Bachelor as Sam, a 65-year-old who sees through Frank's shit. The comic chemistry between DeVito and Kane is instant, bringing out a side of Frank that we don't normally see while also staying true to the character's gross personality. Frank doesn't fall instantly for Sam, but it's the moments between them—the dinner date, Sam's confession about her name, the closing scene—that are the best in this episode by far (and some of the best of the season).

Of course, there's a ton of goofy shit in between the Taxi flashbacks. From Frank trying to do a promo spot for Prime Video to Cock Chewa making faces on a livestream in response to emojis left by fans, “The Golden Bachelor Live” is well-paced, cramming as many jokes as possible into its runtime. 

After doing an OnlyFans livestream with Cock Chewa and having an awkward date with Sam, it's time for the real hometown dates. It's a good idea to get the rest of the ensemble into the season finale instead of stranding Frank on a spoof of a show that a lot of Sunny fans have probably never seen. Proving that the focus groups from last week did almost nothing, the Paddy's Gang is hysterically awkward, especially Charlie, who gets my favorite line of the episode: “I too am feeling things!”

The quartet splits as Dennis and Dee interrogate Sam and Charlie and Mac go to work on the viral sex star. The siblings don't want anyone to get their inheritance; Charlie just doesn't want someone else sleeping on his couch. It's funny to note again, 17 seasons in, how terrified these people are of change. Whenever anything, even a potentially positive one, threatens their stasis, they freak out and destroy it. What's also been consistent is that Frank usually skates through their screwups, finding his own forms of happiness. He may look for get-rich-quick schemes or love on national TV, but he's just as happy sleeping on the couch and banging Charlie's mom.

Speaking of Charlie's mom, Bonnie Kelly is back! Brought in by the crew as someone they can control, she becomes a surprise third finalist in The Golden Bachelor—just in time for the Fantasy Suites. Rather than choosing the order, Frank tries to talk Jesse into a foursome, perhaps even a fivesome if he wants to join as long as he doesn't make eye contact. 

And then DeVito and Kane get one of their best scenes. Kane plays it totally straight as she tells Frank about how she shortened her name from Samantha to Sam to satisfy strangers so they wouldn't have to use as many syllables. She's spent too much of her life pleasing other people while Frank has lived his life exactly as he wanted. “It's never too late to find your heart and your voice and your name,” she says. It's moving

Of course, Frank dumps her with a note that says “Dunzo.”

After a rushed bit about the group setting off an “Elephant Toothpaste Bomb” in the mansion that ends up in them turning into green goblins when Charlie puts Nair in the concoction, Frank is basically left to make his final choice alone. Should he go with his slutty history with Bonnie or the hot young chewer? 

Neither! Frank jumps into the limo and reaches Sam at the bus station while Willie Nelson's great cover of “Always On My Mind” plays in the background. He was afraid. “Would you accept this rose and be my wife?” he asks. And the two kiss. And unlike pretty much every other time we've seen Frank make contact with a female, it's not gross. 

It's a tender in-universe moment followed by a moving tribute to Lynne Marie Stewart, who played Bonnie Kelly. Stewart passed in February, and it's worth noting that her episodes of Sunny were just a part of her legacy. She was a member of The Groundlings in the '70s, working with both Paul Reubens and Phil Hartman there. And, of course, she played Miss Yvonne on Pee-wee's Playhouse. 

Goodbye to “the Most Beautiful Woman in Puppetland.” You will be missed.

David Mackenzie spent the first half of his filmmaking career making uneasy and compelling British dramas filled with off-kilter psychology and actors like Ewan McGregor or Jamie Bell skulking around Scottish canals and rooftops. After knighting Jack O'Connell as a leading man of unique intensity in the prison drama Starred Up, Mackenzie's projects have shown an interest in reflecting the fraught construction of modern America through unambiguous genre stories. If one conveniently ignores Outlaw King, his unfortunate Robert The Bruce biopic for Netflix (nothing more Hollywood than a Californian thinking they can do a Scottish accent), there's a clear throughline between the Texan heist drama Hell Or High Water, Mackenzie's work on the LDS true-crime series Under The Banner Of Heaven, and his new tri-state paranoia thriller Relay.

In both this Michael Clayton-inflected film and his Oscar-nominated Western, Mackenzie applies a workmanlike craft to stories that are too sensationalized to be mistaken for serious drama, yet build suspense on top of real social tension, a disillusionment with power, and a desire to protect oneself (and maybe others) with noble criminality and fine-print loopholes. But where Hell or High Water was finely engineered, a void of personality makes Relay simply mechanical.

Relay stars Riz Ahmed as Ash, a broker who anonymously protects vulnerable people who possess incriminating evidence of corporate malfeasance and secures big payoffs from companies eager to keep their crimes from public view. In the opening scene, the mild-mannered Hoffman (Matthew Maher) goes into a handoff with tetchy executive (Victor Garber) in a nondescript, noir-friendly diner. Unbeknownst to either party, Ash watches from the other side of the restaurant, dressed as a construction worker. It's not the only municipal worker disguise that Ash dons during Relay, a costuming choice that bluntly mirrors his thematically-loaded preferred channel of communication: the Tri-State Relay Service, a telecommunication service where a random operator relays the caller's typed messages to the person they've dialed.

The relay service is primarily intended for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, but operates here as a gold mine for screenwriter Justin Piasecki's paranoid thriller. Throughout the film, different relay service employees blankly read off Ash's messages to his new client, Sarah Grant (Lily James), who stole a damning report from her biotech company. Crucially, Ash's clients have no whistleblower ambitions—they employ him to make the heat go away, preferably with a chunk of cash, without making front-page news or being summoned to high-profile depositions.

Relay makes a lot of savvy, satisfying dramatic choices. There's a pleasing sense of precarity to Sarah's situation—she spends the bulk of the film at arm's length from not just her protector, but the menacing enforcers led by Dawson (the increasingly dependable Sam Worthington) after her valuable intel. Piasecki's screenplay finds many blind spots of public service—not just relay services, but also TSA and the post office—that Ash uses to delay the henchmen from crushing his operation, and Mackenzie engineers extended bouts of tension from asset drops and stakeouts as Ash's control starts to waver. 

In airport lounges, twilight New York streets, and busy tourist spots, Sarah is watched by voyeurs who are also trying to spot each other, but while Ahmed's tense, still expressions effectively channel Relay's wired, weary tone (it's tiring being so paranoid all the time), Relay finds no emotional heft in its ensemble, filling out its characters with weightless shorthand and undermining itself with a late-game twist that betrays any investment in the thriller's David-vs.-Goliath angle. A dead giveaway of the script's shallow emotional reach is Ash's defining backstory: He's a recovering alcoholic, with a neatly explained backstory that drove him away from the assimilation of white, white-collar New York. An AA meeting monologue as character psychology exposition is Grade A hackwork—a handwavey dramatic choice that signals transformation and atonement without proving either.

Likewise, Mackenzie's competent camerawork lacks the precision or alienation needed to evoke the melancholy and anxiety of a '70s paranoid thriller (Klute is a big reference point, as Relay inches towards a wounded, impossible intimacy between Ash and Sarah). Relay is shot like television—loose, unmotivated coverage; muted editing—with a pervading sense of functionality to move to the next plot or character beat rather than creating a mood. As the film veers towards a climax that mirrors the shootout ending of Kiyoshi Kurosawa's recent Cloud but with none of that film's humorous perversion, Relay loses its edge. The film's playful use of communication systems and powerless characters betrays its political indifference to political insight; it is a series of dramatic games linked together with the occasional, unconvincing assurance that there are real people inside these grinding thriller gears.

Mackenzie's robust Hell Or High Water fused its thematic concerns cleanly and ably with its thriller mechanics; Relay attempts the same gambit, but lacks Sheridan's blunt, eccentric personalities to help cover the seams. The resulting film is full of dead air. Rather than discovering anything novel or liberating about the hostile, modern battleground of America, Relay‘s compelling set-up becomes overly dependent on typical rug-pulls and action beats.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Willem Dafoe was shocked by ""fundamental right"" backlash to The Last Temptation of Christ","https://www.avclub.com/the-last-temptation-of-christ-backlash-willem-dafoe","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 14:35:00 GMT","

People were so upset in the lead-up to The Last Temptation Of Christ that it's somewhat surprising they didn't try to crucify Martin Scorsese himself. The 1988 film, which depicted Jesus as a conflicted man struggling with his faith, inspired widespread protests, a request to Universal to destroy all existing prints, and blanket bans at multiple theater chains. (If you're curious, PBS has a good look back at the controversy here.) 

While any faith-based film has the potential to upset certain groups, Willem Dafoe, who portrayed this questioning Jesus, was “shocked” by the fervent backlash. Dafoe reflected on the experience in a recent talk at the Sarajevo Film Festival, during which he claimed that the campaign to get the movie banned was “driven by the religious right who needed something to energize their cause,” per Variety. “They complained about the idea of the movie,” he continued. “They hadn't seen it.”

“Then it morphed into a strange thing about Jews in Hollywood and became an antisemitic thing,” he recalled. “It snowballed. The perception is that it was the Catholic Church, and it wasn't the Catholic Church; it was the fundamental right in America that started [it]. I was shocked because in an age of super-violent movies and porn, this is a movie that was trying to address the nature of faith. It was a sincere attempt.”

Despite everything that arose around it, Dafoe still considers his work in the film a “beautiful role.” In fact, it was one of the veteran actor's “favorite roles because it was so demanding.” “You're in every shot,” he shared. “We had very little resources, we shot very fast, no money, but that was the way to shoot it because we didn't get distracted by the spectacle. We could only do what we do. There was a beauty, a grace, and simplicity to it.”

If nothing else, the film gave Dafoe a pretty solid plan B if the whole acting thing ever takes a nosedive. When asked if he enjoyed being crucified for the film, the actor responded that it was “an experience.” “I put any of you up on a cross and you'll have an experience,” he went on. “In fact, if all of this goes to hell, I can find a patch of land and make it an experience.” Dafoe is currently booked and busy, so he probably won't have time for that any time soon, but if he does, we'll see how the same groups that tried to cast The Last Temptation Of Christ out of Hollywood react.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Star Trek: Strange New Worlds breaks format with a documentary episode","https://www.avclub.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-recap-season-3-episode-7","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 13:02:16 GMT","

Huh. After a season of Strange New Worlds that's mostly focused on action, comedy, romance, and horror, I've been craving something more intellectual from the series, one of those classic Trek episodes that really makes you think rather than just providing easy good guys and bad guys. And, at first, “What Is Starfleet?” seems to have all the hallmarks of such an episode: a complex war; a giant, scientifically exploited space creature; an outsider's perspective courtesy of Ortegas' little brother Beto and his probing documentary. 

The first half of the episode lays out the pieces for what could be a complicated morality play like Deep Space Nine's “In The Pale Moonlight” or at least last season's “Ad Astra Per Aspera.” Only then it just…ends—to the point where I checked my screener to make sure I hadn't accidentally missed a scene. Instead of starting simple and growing more complex, “What Is Starfleet?” starts with a bunch of complicated, thorny ideas only to winnow them down to a celebration of how great Starfleet is. And that makes it an odd watch, even if it's relatively engaging on a scene-to-scene basis. 

That starts with another patented Strange New Worlds high-concept premise: This entire episode is framed as Beto's documentary, complete with talking head interviews, declassified security footage, and artistically composed shots from a budding filmmaker. It's another example of Strange New Worlds' tendency to conflate episodic TV with high-concept gimmicks, although in this case I don't mind the switch-up. We're used to seeing our Enterprise crew from one “objective” point of view, so it's interesting to look at them from a different lens for once. 

It turns out Beto's aim isn't just to document Starfleet procedure, but to raise questions about whether the Federation's space exploration/defense arm might actually be an imperial power in disguise. As he puts it, “Both colonize. Both impose their laws and doctrines on others. Are they explorers as they claim or soldiers as they appear? They call their vessels starships. What distinguishes them from warships?” 

It's all a bit melodramatic (intentionally so, I think). But the idea of an episode all about morality and values rather than interpersonal drama is an exciting addition to the season. Beto particularly zeroes in on how much combat and violence are part of the Starfleet experience. This week, for instance, the Enterprise is called in to help with a brutal war between Lutani VII and its sister planet Kasar. The Kasar's goal is to lay claim to the Lutani system and its resources. So far there have been nine million Lutani war casualties and only 119,000 on the Kasar side. 

My initial thought upon seeing those numbers was that Strange New Worlds was about to weigh in on the current war in Gaza, which would've been both a bold choice and perfectly in keeping with Star Trek's original ethos of timely socio-political commentary. But the episode soon pivots to a different conflict instead. The Enterprise has been tasked with transporting classified cargo to Lutani VII. And part of that cargo is a giant space moth called a Jikaru, which the Lutani claim they're going to use in their rebuilding efforts but which they've actually modified to be a massive weapon.

It's a thorny dilemma: The Lutani are a non-Federation world who have attacked Starfleet in the past. (Ortegas suggests they're aligned with the Klingons.) But they're now being decimated by the Kasar on a horrifying scale. And their only hope of winning the war is to subjugate a giant sentient being. How will the Enterprise deal with that impossible moral dilemma? By ignoring half of it, of course! 

In the end, “What Is Starfleet?” winds up glossing over the war to become an episode about whether it's okay to mistreat a giant, beautiful, sympathetic space creature. And while it's sweet to watch Uhura advocate for communicating with the Jikaru to see what it wants, that shift in focus feels like such a cop-out. Instead of an episode about the morality of global interventionism, we get one about how animals have feelings too. And the fact that the Jikaru was modified by Lutani scientists rather than Federation ones means we don't even really get any kind of critique of Starfleet in the end, either. For an episode about how hard it is to follow orders, none of the orders our crew have to follow this week seem particularly tough. 

That's because the arc of “What Is Starfleet?” doesn't actually belong to any of our central heroes. Instead, it belongs to Beto, who comes to realize he entered this project with a bias against Starfleet. Apparently, he's been harboring resentment towards the organization ever since it took his sister away and especially after Ortegas' recent Gorn injury. It takes Uhura to help him see that. But it's hard to care about her warm advice that he can still mend things with his sister when I had no idea until that scene that there was anything between them that needed mending. As far as I can remember, the only tension between Ortegas and Beto during his intro in “Wedding Bell Blues” is that she didn't want her lovable kid brother flirting with her co-worker. 

That speaks to an overall structural weirdness with this season of Strange New Worlds. When the series began, it made the clever choice to deliver old-fashioned episodic television with serialized character arcs. But this season has really dropped the ball on the second half of that equation. The reason to introduce Beto so early in the season would be to establish an emotional arc that gets paid off here. But as with Ortegas' PTSD, Gamble's death, the La'An/Spock relationship, the Pike/M'Benga friendship, and Marie's Gorn treatment, the big emotional drivers of the season are totally stop-and-go depending on what each individual episode calls for. 

I think that's a big part of what's making the show's third season feel kind of listless, even though there have been moments I've enjoyed in every episode so far. If anything, I'm probably underselling how much “What Is Starfleet?” works on a scene-to-scene basis. Its strongest moments are the talking head interviews about violence. M'Benga contrasting his role as a doctor with his history in the Klingon War is a compelling use of Babs Olusanmokun's quiet intensity. Uhura learning on-camera that her Starfleet Academy roommate died on the Cayuga is haunting. And I liked the frustration Anson Mount channels as Pike pushes back on how flippantly Beto asks about death. 

There's just a disconnect between the small-scale stuff that's working and the big-picture ideas that are floundering. There's poignancy to the way the Jikaru asks Pike to protect her children as she flies into a sun to sacrifice herself. But why make the Lutani death toll so extreme if the episode doesn't want to grapple with that? Why make the Kasars a colonizing force if the episode doesn't want to tie that into Beto's critique of Federation imperialism? Why end this episode with such an upbeat montage about how Starfleet is the best rather than at least allowing some shades of grey to remain? Shouldn't Starfleet policing how a non-Federation people fight back against their oppressors aid Beto's critique, not refute it?

This episode really only works if you don't think about it too hard and let its vibes wash over you. But then why use the probing format of a documentary to tell this particular story? It's a genre about digging in and thinking deeply. And that makes it an odd fit for an episode that wants to end with a feel-good montage about how Starfleet has given Ortegas a family, Uhura a purpose, and Spock a place to explore his human half—sweet as those ideas may be.  

So far, the most memorable episodes of the season have either been the ones where the gimmick is strong enough to make up for the weaker writing (“A Space Adventure Hour”) or where the writing is strong enough to make up for a weaker gimmick (“The Sehlat Who Ate Its Tail”). But, ideally, form and function should be working as one. For a while, it feels like they are in “What Is Starfleet?” But a tacked-on happy ending winds up undercutting too much of what came before.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Netflix's Hostage feels like The Diplomat lite","https://www.avclub.com/hostage-review-netflix-tv-miniseries","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 00:01:00 GMT","

With echoes of Emmy nominees like The Diplomat and Bodyguard, the latest Netflix U.K. import about the intersection of political crises and personal dilemmas sounds promising enough on paper, with the makings of a miniseries that could be gripping and gobbled up over a late-August weekend. But sadly, Hostage is the kind of show you'll forget by Labor Day. 

The five-episode thriller centers on a meeting between the British Prime Minister and the French President in the shadow of growing crises, including a deadly pharmaceutical shortage that's threatening to tear England apart. While she's facing pressures to deal with a country that has increasingly less confidence in her, PM Abigail Dalton (Suranne Jones) is also raising her daughter Sylvie (Isobel Akuwudike) and caring for her father Max (James Cosmo). 

Her political opposite, the conservative French leader Vivienne Toussaint (Julie Delpy), has arrived in London for a summit about the drug shortage and what her country can do to stop it. One of the more interesting early elements of Hostage is that Toussaint and Dalton clearly don't particularly like each other and not just on a political level, which allows creator Matt Charman to play with the differences between not just British and French leadership but the personalities and priorities of the countries. Sadly, it's one of several avenues left largely unexplored in the three episodes screened for critics, as the writing is forced to eschew any serious sociopolitical commentary once the plot kicks in. Instead, almost every scene in the show involves characters saying exactly what they're thinking and/or need to do to get what they want.

The real drama starts when Dalton's husband, Dr. Alex Anderson (Ashley Thomas), is kidnapped in French Guiana. The kidnappers send the P.M. a video insisting that she must step down by a certain time or her partner will be executed. Given French control over the South American region, Toussaint is in a position to come to the rescue of her G7 frenemy, and she seems willing to do so until the kidnappers play with her political future too, blackmailing her into standing down. It leads to an amazing amount of dialogue like “a choice between this job and my family”—you know, the kind of thing that no one actually says.

And speaking of family, the way it's used here feels like it edges on misogyny. It doesn't seem an accident that both leaders are female, and so the choice to make their partners and children into Achilles' heels for enemies to exploit almost comes off as a commentary. It's no fault of the talented young actor who portrays her, but Sylvie, Abigail's daughter, is a plot device in human clothes, a character designed purely to put maternal pressure on a protagonist in a way that feels pretty gross. And a scene in which Sylvie just happens to walk into a room to see something terrifying comes off like one of the more ridiculous dramatic TV choices of the year. Add the shallow Sylvie/Abigail dynamic to the fact that Vivienne's decision-making becomes driven by a secret related to her stepson, and you have a show that too often feels like it's playing into disgusting, prehistoric tropes about the flaws of female leadership.



If the writing was more consistently entertaining, it might be easier to excuse the arguable sexism of Hostage as accidental. But too many of the scenes play out with people who don't act or speak like actual human beings, coming off like cogs in an over-oiled plot machine. The daughter is the most egregious example of this, a character who exists only to repeatedly say things like, “If you get my dad killed, I'll never forgive you.” Where shows like The Diplomat take the time to truly humanize world leaders, this one is happy to keep them two-dimensional as often as possible in order to serve the plot. It's a thriller that feels manufactured instead of driven by the behavior or relatable human beings, and it's not even gripping enough for that to be forgivable on the level of a guilty pleasure.

Luckily, this isn't the case all the time. There is one great scene in the second episode in which Jones and Delpy are allowed to shine as their characters go through the motions of a political PR moment about electronic vehicles as they discuss far more serious issues in a lower register. The always-good Delpy particularly excels at finding that strained smile for the cameras, the one that politicians master at a young age if they want to get the support of their people. (It also sells how much Toussaint knows that the real important stuff is happening away from the waves given to TV audiences.) This is a beat that doesn't feel as overwritten, one driven by character and even political commentary more than just dull plotting.

Unfortunately, these moments are few and far between. Perhaps Chapman and his team will find a satisfying way to bring the personal and political drama of Vivienne Toussaint and Abigail Dalton together in the last two hours in a manner that makes the shallow nature of these three episodes feel like table-setting. It's possible, but the cheap cliffhanger to end the third hour makes it seem even less likely that viewers are going to get a satisfying, meaty payoff. 

Hostage premieres August 21 on Netflix

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Scream 7 directors new and old weigh in on franchise's messy, sudden shift","https://www.avclub.com/scream-7-directors-christopher-landon-kevin-williamson","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 02:18:00 GMT","

Two years after the situation surrounding Scream 7—or, at least, its first incarnation—fell apart, personal reactions regarding the general clusterfuck that erupted when star Melissa Barrera was fired from the series have finally begun to emerge. Co-star Jenna Ortega opened up about her own departure a few months back, for instance, noting that Barrera being fired (over social media statements in support of Palestine, and which production company Spyglass labeled as “hate speech”) was essentially the last straw in a general sense that their little rebooted sub-franchise was “falling apart.” Director Christopher Landon—who'd come to the series after directing the Happy Death Day movies, and was taking over for fifth and sixth movie directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett—has talked about receiving death threats against both himself, and his family, harsh enough to catch the attention of the FBI. Now, new excerpts from an upcoming book on the series, Your Favorite Scary Movie, has seen Landon go into even more detail about how the whole thing collapsed.

This is per Entertainment Weekly, one of several outlets publishing excerpts from Ashley Cullins' new book, which examines the whole history of the franchise. That includes the Scream 7 debacle, with Landon noting that he formally told Spyglass he was bailing on the project about a week after Barrera's firing was announced. (Which means, among other things, that people were largely screaming at him online over a job he'd already quit: “They were all screaming at someone who wasn't even on the movie anymore,” Landon says in a quote. “There were a lot of people who thought I was some sort of villain. That really got in my head. It was painful, and it was painful to lose a dream job in such a sudden and bizarre way.”)

Landon also makes it clear that the writing was on the wall pretty much from the minute Barrera's firing was revealed to him, and that Scream 7, as he'd conceived it, simply couldn't happen without her and her character: “There was no movie anymore. The whole script was about her. I didn't sign on to make ‘a Scream movie.' I signed on to make that movie. When that movie no longer existed, I moved on.”

Of course, Landon isn't the only person—or even the only Scream 7 director—interviewed for Cullins' book. Excerpts featuring long-time franchise writer Kevin Williamson (who's stepping into the director's chair with Scream 7, now with original star Neve Campbell in tow) have also popped up on Bloody Disgusting, and paint a much rosier, if unsurprisingly backwards-looking, portrait of the franchise's future: “Neve wants to go back to the first one and find the suspense and really concentrate on scary and not bloody,” Williamson asserts. “She was smart. She goes, ‘This is the time to do it because we're moving away from New York. We're going back to Sidney's life. This is the time to reset a little bit. And I'm like, ‘Yup, let's do it.'” Certainly, it sounds like Spyglass was willing to toss out whatever work Ortega, Barrera, Bettinelli-Olpin, and Gillett had been building together—often quite lucratively—on the new version of Screamin order to get back to perceived basics; whether fans will agree that the new film hits those “suspense” notes and lands at “scary” instead of “bloody” will become a lot clearer once Scream 7‘s February 2026 release date arrives.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","PHOTOS: ‘Bold & the Beautiful' Makes History as ‘New Era' Begins","https://entertainmentnow.com/soap-operas/bold-the-beautiful-new-studio-photos/","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 00:47:26 GMT","

It's the dawn of a new era for The Bold and the Beautiful as the soap officially settles into its brand-new studio.

On Tuesday, August 19, the cast and crew marked their first day of taping at Sunset Las Palmas Studios. The move was first announced in June, when it was revealed that the CBS daytime drama would relocate to the historic production lot after 38 years at Television City, per Deadline.

Now, filming is officially underway on the newly built sets, signaling a fresh chapter for the long-running series.

A post shared by The Bold and The Beautiful (@boldandbeautifulcbs)

“The Bold and the Beautiful” OG cast member John McCook, who has played Eric Forrester since day one, shares his thoughts on the show's fresh start in its new studio.

“38 years playing Eric Forrester and we're beginning again at Sunset Las Palmas Studio,” the veteran actor wrote on Instagram. “ It's never too late to try something new. Keep letting me know what you like and what you don't like. We're a family.”

Another longest-running cast member, Katherine Kelly Lang (Brooke Logan), admits to having mixed emotions about the historic move. The actress also gave fans a glimpse of her new dressing room on the set.

She wrote in part, “There's something magical about stepping into new studios after 38 years… a mix of excitement, fresh beginnings, and the chance to create a whole new chapter of memories and stories.”

Don Diamont, who plays Bill Spencer, also showed off “The Bold and the Beautiful's” new home, while Annika Noelle (Hope Logan) is thankful for the new chapter in their “new home away from home.”

To commemorate the historic day, “The Bold and the Beautiful” Executive Producer and Head Writer Bradley Bell leads the symbolic ribbon-cutting ceremony, alongside CEO and Chairman of Hudson Pacific, Victor Coleman.

“This is a place where history is made, and today, history is being made,” Coleman announces before Bell proceeds to cut the ribbon.

Also in attendance are the cast members, including John McCook, Katherine Kelly Lang, Don Diamont, Kimberlin Brown, and more. Check out the behind-the-scenes photos below.

When it's time for bed, pop star and past “The Voice” coach Nick Jonas takes the task very seriously. 

On August 18, 2025, Jonas shared a jaw-dropping confession on the social media Q&A series “Are You Okay?” He was asked to name his “beige flag,” a term used to describe a romantic partner's bizarre but not breakup-worthy habits, per The New York Times, and his answer has prompted a hilarious debate among fans. 

Jonas confessed that his beige flag is refusing to do anything in bed other than sleep — and that he even pulls up a chair next to his wife, actress Priyanka Chopra, to watch TV. His explanation led “Are You Okay” host Bri Morales to declare his habits “crazy,” but not everyone agrees.

Explaining his “beige flag,” Jonas told Morales, “I think beds are for sleeping only. I don't sit on the bed, I don't eat on the bed, I don't read a book on the bed or watch TV. I can't do it.”

Morales quipped, “You are robbing yourself of one of the greatest pleasures in life.”

But Jonas countered, “I just don't like it to get warm. I run hot, it's a whole thing.”

When Morales asked if Jonas and Chopra have a TV in their bedroom, he confirmed that they do, explaining, “My wife watches it. I'll pull up a seat up and sit next to the bed.” 

That prompted Morales to laugh, “That is crazy!” 

Many fans have expressed shock over Jonas being so particular about his bed, while others have defended the singer, admitting that they are totally on board with it. 

One shocked comment on Instagram — which generated over 5,000 likes — said, “Noooo it's giving NOT OKAY 😭 wdym he sits on a chair next to the bed to watch tv????”

Someone else quipped, “I need to ask Priyanka some questions cuz Nick is def NOT OKAY 😂”

Another person on TikTok wrote, “He really is an old man stuck in a millennial's body I can't 😩

But some found the singer's admission endearing, including one who hilariously wrote on Instagram, “[Expletive], i'm in love with him”

Someone else commented, “Does nobody understand proper sleep hygiene?!? I stand in solidarity with you @nickjonas”

Another person quick to defend Jonas wrote, “Fully agree with the bed take! No tv, no eating, no “hanging out”, just sleep. I am also a Virgo 🤪”

The Jonas Brothers released their newest album, “Greetings From Your Hometown,” on August 8 and are currently on a North American tour through mid-November.

After HGTV shocked fans by not renewing at least seven long-running shows during the summer of 2025, viewers have been eager to know what will air in place of series like “Farmhouse Fixer” and “Bargain Block.” 

They now have their answer. On August 21, the network announced a slate of new series set to premiere in late 2025 and early 2026, in addition to renewing several popular series. 

In a press release, HGTV said it has ordered over 100 episodes of fresh content, including 60 episodes of renewed shows from popular personalities including Ben and Erin Napier, Alison Victoria, and Jasmine Roth.  

A post shared by Paul Head CSA – Reality Casting (@paulheadcasting)

Howard Lee, who oversees HGTV as Chief Creative Officer for US Networks at Warner Bros. Discovery, said in a statement, “HGTV's passionate fans tune in for our signature home renovation, real estate and design expertise, and they also want content that's unfiltered, escapist and fun. The network's large order of new and returning series has something for everyone.” 

That will include two new series with eye-popping titles — “Cheap A$$ Beach Houses” and “Tropic Like It's Hot.” The first, produced by Bodega Pictures, will premiere in late 2025 to “humorously show viewers how to own a slice of affordable paradise,” per HGTV. The production company posted a casting notice in May, looking for homeowners and realtors searching for beach houses on a budget to be featured on a new show “for a major network.”

The second just-announced series, “Tropic Like It's Hot,” from Leopard USA, will “put alluring destinations and luxury living in the tropics center stage for buyers looking to turn up the heat in life and love.” The show is expected to debut in early 2026. 

HGTV previously announced that another new series starring “Queer Eye” alum Bobby Berk will debut in  late 2025, with a working title of “Junk or Jackpot.”

HGTV has also ordered a new holiday series with the working title “Hoarding for the Holidays,” produced by Exit Four Media, and said it will continue its “White House Christmas” tradition with a one-hour special, though this year's hosts have not been revealed. 

As previously reported, HGTV has renewed multiple series that will premiere new seasons in the fall, including “100 Day Dream Home” with Brian and Mika Kleinschmidt, “Help! I Wrecked My Home” with Jasmine Roth, Retta's “Scariest House in America,” and “Fixer to Fabulous” with Dave and Jenny Marrs. 

On August 21, HGTV also announced that it has renewed “The Flip Off” for a second season starring longtime HGTV stars Tarek and Heather Rae El Moussa and Christina Haack, and “Renovation Aloha” with Tristyn and Kamohai Kalama for a third season. 

Alison Victoria also returns with a spinoff of her show “Windy City Rehab” — the Las Vegas-based “Sin City Rehab,” premiering on September 17 at 9 p.m. Eastern time. 

In its announcement, HGTV also revealed that a “Home Town” spinoff called “Home Town: Inn This Together” will air in 2026, starring Erin and Ben Napier.

Hallmark Media, the division of Hallmark that oversees Hallmark Channel and its sister channels — Hallmark Mystery and Hallmark Drama, as well as streaming platform Hallmark+ — is the latest TV network to be hit by summer layoffs. 

On August 20, 2025, Deadline reported that Hallmark Media has eliminated 30 jobs and that the network's Los Angeles offices will soon move. The question on fans' minds, of course, is whether all those missing roles will impact the quality or quantity of the movies and shows they love. 

A post shared by Hynies Headquarters (@hynies_headquarters)

Hallmark didn't elaborate on the specific roles that were eliminated, but Deadline reported that one person swept up in the layoffs was Vice President of Production Jimmy Holcomb, who oversaw physical production of movies, series, and specials. 

A spokesperson for Hallmark Media told Deadline, “As the industry continues to traverse a significant period of transformation, Hallmark is taking steps to transition our workforce to meet the needs of the business today. This means an ongoing exploration of specific roles and functions.”

“While these decisions are never easy,” the Hallmark spokesperson continued, “we have eliminated 30 roles across multiple areas of the organization and have restructured parts of our business with the goal of investing in capabilities that will propel our business into the future.”

According to Deadline, Hallmark Media's Los Angeles-area offices will also move from Studio City and relocate to Burbank, which is known as the “Media Capital of the World,” serving as home base for over 1,000 entertainment companies including Walt Disney Studios, Netflix and Nickelodeon. 

A post shared by Michelle Vicary (@michellevicaryhc)

The announcement about Hallmark Media's layoffs was made less than three weeks after the company announced, on August 5, that former creative executive Michelle Vicary was returning to oversee all of Hallmark's programming, according to Variety.

Vicary was part of the cable channel's birth in 2001 and is well-loved by many Hallmark stars and staff. Before her departure in 2021, she served in multiple positions at the company, including as Executive VP of programming. 

According to Variety, Vicary launched the network's annual Countdown to Christmas programming and several beloved series, including “When Calls the Heart,” and the since-canceled “Good Witch,” and “Chesapeake Shores.” She also “expanded the company's commitment to diverse storytelling, including hiring multiple LGBTQ+ actors,” Variety reported. 

Many stars and fans have expressed excitement about Vicary's return, hoping that she'll bring renewed clarity about the future and may consider rebooting fan-favorite programs that were canceled during her time away, including “Chesapeake Shores,” “Good Witch,” and the talk show “Home & Family.” 

It's not clear yet how the new layoffs may impact Vicary's vision, but already-announced programming should move forward as planned during the last four months of 2025, including the 16th annual Countown to Christmas — a yearly tradition that she helped launch.

Pop star Meghan Trainor is no longer “All About That Bass,” happily showcasing her fit physique and impressive strength in a new social media video on August 21, 2025. But many fans say Trainor, a season 22 advisor on “American Idol” who was very vocal about wanting to be the show's next judge after Katy Perry's departure, is nearly unrecognizable in her new post. 

Less than an hour after Trainor's post, hundreds had already liked one Instagram comment that said, “Wait that's Megan trainor? 😮” while others defended the singer, flooding her with compliments over her new look. 

In March, Trainor opened up about her weight loss journey, which has included “huge lifestyle changes,” from intense workouts to using the weight loss tool Mounjaro, telling People, “I have never been more comfortable in my body.”

A post shared by Meghan Trainor (@meghantrainor)

Trainor's August 21 video featured her take on the viral Nicki Minaj Challenge trend, which dares people to defy gravity by balancing on one foot, in a seated position, on top of random objects, per Today.com. Trainor was filmed in a workout room, calmly balancing on top of two dumbbells that had been flipped on their sides and stacked on top of each other. 

The singer quipped in her caption, “never again #nickiminajchallenge”

Trainor's post was instantly flooded with comments from followers. But the majority of the comments weren't about her impressive balancing act but, rather, about her transformed physique and face. 

“I didn't recognize you,” one person wrote, and another comment — liked by hundreds of followers — said, “Wow why does she look like a different person. This is not her”

One fan noted that Trainor looked more like Ariana Grande than herself, and another complained, “You are starting to look like everything you were once singing against. So much for self lov”e and empowerment…”

But Trainor was deluged with compliments, too, including one that said, “MOTHERRRRR YOU LOOK GORGEOUS 🥹🔥”

Someone else deemed Trainor the “prettiest girl on planet,” while another fan declared, “mama you look AMAZING 😍😍”

The comments from fans won't likely faze Trainor, who's been an open book about the tools she's used to change her look in ways that boost her confidence. 

“No, I don't look like I did 10 years ago,” she wrote on Instagram in May. “I've been on a journey to be the healthiest, strongest version of myself for my kids and for me.”

Trainor, who shares two young sons with her husband Daryl Sabara, wrote after being honored at Billboard's Women in Music event, that “it's a little disheartening that so many of the questions (and comments) were focused on my body instead of my music, my passion, or the decade of hard work that got me here. This is what it's like to be a woman in the music industry.”

Trainor went on to say, “I've worked with a dietician, made huge lifestyle changes, started exercising with a trainer, and yes, I used science and support (shoutout to Mounjaro!) to help me after my 2nd pregnancy. And I'm so glad I did because I feel great.”

“Here's to celebrating talent, growth, and the power of putting yourself first,” she concluded. “Let's keep shifting the convo to what REALLY matters.”

Only John Waters could pull off emceeing a New York Film Festival double feature of Gaspar Noé's abrasive acid trip “Climax” and Pier Paolo Pasolini's harrowing art-meets-exploitation, anti-fascist epic “Saló, or the 120 Days of Sodom” — and at a pop-up drive-in at the Bronx Zoo, of all places, and in the height of COVID-20.

“When I grew up in the drive-in, you always honked when you saw breasts or gore. So I said, ‘Honk when you see art.' Every time there was an art shot, everybody honked,” the Pope of Trash told IndieWire during a recent phone interview.

 










So in the case of “Saló,” Pasolini's final film before the Italian filmmaker was murdered by a 17-year-old sex worker at a beach in Ostia, Rome, in 1975, that must have meant a lot of honking. Shot by cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli, it's one of the most visually beautiful films ever made. Galaxy-brained cinephiles and critics argue Pasolini was assassinated as part of a conspiracy against his own anti-fascist views; Waters has argued that the gay 53-year-old filmmaker simply had a bad night, a hook-up turned disastrous.

“Saló” premiered at the Paris Film Festival in November 1975, the same month as Pasolini's death, and it took two years for the film to arrive, uncut, on U.S. soil in limited release via Zebra Releasing Corporation. The word of mouth around town, especially where “Saló” played in New York City, was eruptive. 

Modeled after Dante's “Inferno” but inspired most directly by the Marquis de Sade's “120 Days of Sodom,” this grand and disturbing classic is set in a real Italian fascist puppet state in the early 1940s. There, Pasolini imagines four libertines who kidnap a group of teenagers — young men and women — and subject them to rape, torture, degradation, brainwashing, and, of course and most infamously, shit-eating. (“Saló” is also #2 on IndieWire's list of the Best Films of the 1970s.)

That shit, on Pasolini's set, was chocolate, but three years prior to “Saló,” Waters had Divine eat actual dog feces for his riotous and boundary-exploding dark comedy “Pink Flamingos,” a film as counterculturally influential as “Saló” would too become. In 2021, Waters released the spoken-word album “Prayer to Pasolini,” which features the director speaking in tongues and paying tribute to one of his cinematic idols — and it was recorded at the park outside the Roman airport where Pasolini was killed, a place that has now become a shrine to the director and a pilgrimage for film lovers. 

 










There, Pasolini was run over multiple times by the hustler who hijacked his car, allegedly crushing the filmmaker's testicles with a metal bar in the process.

“I was amazed because, if you go online, they say [the park is] locked, but it isn't locked. The lock is fake. You get there, and it's a beautiful park and really in the middle of nowhere, where he got killed. Who paid for that? Who did that? It's in the middle of nowhere. It was really a holy card for me to go there,” said Waters, who gathered twigs, pine cones, and “relics, as they used to call them in the Catholic church.”

He said, “In my stand-up show, I do a thing where I say I'll have to go back to being a puppeteer, where I started with children's birthday parties, but I want to do ‘Saló' with very mature children, rich kids.”

Most of the actors, such as the Mediterranean Italian Franco Merli, whom Pasolini first discovered for his 1974 film “Arabian Nights,” were unknown and nonprofessionals. Some were models, and the physical beauty of his cast was a feature, not a bug, of Pasolini's vision, as there's no denying the parade of lithe, naked twinks on display and gorgeous Italian men and women, almost like face powder over the hidden ugliness.

“I read an interview somewhere, I don't remember where, the Catholic kids were underage and naked, eating fake shit, and [one said], ‘We had the best time making “Saló.” Every time Pasolini yelled “cut,” we were laughing. The movie was always easy bait for censors because people go crazy when they watch it, and it is incredibly confrontational. Pasolini was dead serious about making that movie. He didn't do it as an exploitation film,” Waters said. “He didn't do it as anything but an art film, which all his films were.”

 










There is, though, inherent comedy in “Saló” despite the film being dead-serious, whether a Signora pantomiming a handjob on a mannequin. Or lines like, “Show the mass of this impertinent boy,” or one of the four libertines boasting about a young boy's “splendid anal regions.”

“It was very confrontational. The statements he's making about fascism and everything are very true, and I think people were just so blindsided by the whole movie. I always just thought it was a really, really good movie, and God knows it delivers,” Waters said. “I always said I made art films for exploitation theaters, and exploitation films for art theaters. In certain ways, this was the same thing. It had shock value elements, of course, that people were insane from, and it really was confrontational and like no other movie. To me, I was just jealous — I said that kind of jokingly — at the outrage it caused internationally.”

Pasolini was a wild contradiction as an artist, the sort that would not survive the black-and-white, ideological nonnegotiables of much of cultural discourse today. He was an atheist and a Catholic, a Communist, and a homosexual. He was pro-cops but anti-hippies because cops “were cuter,” according to Waters. “He liked trade, and I guess cops were more like trade than hippies. Especially, he liked boys with pimples,” he said. “I did a piece for a photo shoot called ‘Pasolini's Pimples,' and I went through all his movies and shot pimples and then cut them out into a collage of just pimples. He liked pimples.”

 










Retrospective considerations of the political timeliness of classic films can get didactic, but that Pasolini transplanted a book from the late 1700s into 1940s fascist Italy proves “Saló's” timelessness, and its chilling resonance now — especially when you think about QAnon, adrenochrome, and the conspiracy theorists who believe that supposed vampiric, wealthy pedophiles control the world order. Trade one oligarchy for another, and the 1940s Republic of Saló looks mighty familiar.

“Depending on your politics, there are many elements that would be the same as today right now, it would be even more relevant,” Waters said. “It remains a beautiful movie that Pasolini would be proud of, and it doesn't get any easier to digest in any way, maybe even harder today because of the things it touches on. It's a beautiful movie against fascism.”

IndieWire's ‘70s Week is presented by Bleecker Street's “RELAY.” Riz Ahmed plays a world class “fixer” who specializes in brokering lucrative payoffs between corrupt corporations and the individuals who threaten their ruin. IndieWire calls “RELAY” “sharp, fun, and smartly entertaining from its first scene to its final twist, ‘RELAY' is a modern paranoid thriller that harkens back to the genre's '70s heyday.” From director David Mackenzie (“Hell or High Water”) and also starring Lily James, in theaters August 22.

A new Kelly Reichardt movie is always cause for celebration, and this fall will see her return to the big screen with “The Mastermind.” The Josh O'Connor vehicle sees the famously deliberate director taking her talents to New England in the 1970s, with the actor starring as a carpenter who makes a regrettable career pivot into art theft.

An official synopsis for the film reads: “In a sedate corner of Massachusetts circa 1970, JB Mooney (Josh O'Connor), an unemployed carpenter turned amateur art thief, plans his first big heist. When things go haywire, his life unravels.”

 










“The Mastermind” premiered in competition at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, where critics praised Reichardt for branching out from her typical Pacific Northwest locations and subject matter while still keeping her distinct style intact.

“Shot on film with the grainy warmth that evokes a sleepy 1970 New England municipality as much as it does actual movies from the ‘70s, ‘The Mastermind' is Reichardt's version of a heist movie — meaning that the filmmaker hijacks conventions laid by filmmakers like Jean-Pierre Melville and Sidney Lumet for a spin that still retains her patient bent for long, luxuriating takes,” IndieWire's Ryan Lattanzio wrote in his Cannes review. “Here, Josh O'Connor plays J.B. Mooney (what a name!), an art thief who falls down a hole of his own digging, as a poorly hatched job to rip off a series of Arthur Dove abstract paintings from a fictional Massachusetts museum sends his private and family lives careening out of his grasp.”

 










“The Mastermind” is written and directed by Kelly Reichardt, who reunites with her frequent cinematographer Christopher Blauvelt. In addition to O'Connor, the film stars Alana Haim, Gaby Hoffman, John Magaro, Hope Davis, and Bill Camp. The film will next screen at the New York Film Festival alongside other Cannes, Venice, and Toronto favorites and premieres like Bradley Cooper's “Is This Thing On?”

The film is part of a big fall for O'Connor, who also stars alongside Paul Mescal in “The History of Sound” and in Rian Johnson's new “Knives Out” mystery “Wake Up Dead Man.” Next spring, he stars alongside Emily Blunt in Steven Spielberg's untitled UFO blockbuster.

A MUBI release, “The Mastermind” opens in select theaters on Friday, October 17. Watch the trailer below.

Queer punk filmmaker Bruce LaBruce is one of the best people to talk to about Pier Paolo Pasolini's shocking high-art-meets-exploitation classic “Saló, or the 120 Days of Sodom” because the Canadian director himself is one who has straddled pornography and art films. 

Those include his 2024 depraved family affair “The Visitor,” itself a quasi-remake of Pasolini's “Teorema,” starring the recently deceased Terence Stamp as a handsome stranger who upends the lives of an upper-class Milanese family by fucking them all, physically and spiritually. Pasolini's “Saló” too is filled with graphic sex acts — but packaged up in one of the most visually arresting movies of all time, with shots meticulously blocked and adorned like moving, gilded tableaux.

Coprophagy is also a factor in “The Visitor,” and is one of the many still-shocking elements of “Saló,” for which Pasolini's critique of World War II-era Italian fascism is most infamous. IndieWire polled LaBruce about “Saló” as the director has long been fascinated with Pasolini's contradictory nature — his atheism, his Catholicism, his homosexuality, and how that's all bound up in works that both embrace and detest the social order.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Pasolini was an iconoclast up until his death, which has inspired numerous conspiracy theories, LaBruce argues, because so many people wanted Pasolini dead for his art and his views. LaBruce — whose 2013 “Gerontophilia” explored a kind of reverse pederast relationship and is a film that would've fit comfortably into Pasolini's oeuvre — also thinks the nature of Pasolini's final moments and the viscerality of his murder is a little “fishy.” 

The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.

IndieWire: Pasolini was an artist of enormous contradictions. He was a gay Catholic who was also an atheist. He was also a communist. What do you make of that as an artist who has straddled art film and pornography?

Bruce LaBruce: He embraced both highbrow culture and lowbrow culture at the same time. He wasn't so interested in anything in between, the bourgeoisie and the petite bourgeoisie, but he liked the intellectual, philosophical class who are educated and are the philosophers and poets. Then, the people who are uneducated and his kind of Spinozan idea that the uneducated are closer to animals and God, really, because they're not spoiled by knowledge.

When did you first see the movie? I don't know the release or censorship there. It did make it to the U.S. censored.
 










It was banned in Canada. I grew up in Ontario, I went to school in Toronto, and we had a notoriously harsh censor board. A lot of ‘70s and ‘80s films were outright banned, like “Saló.” I think it was completely banned; they didn't even release it with cuts. There was a whole spate of movies they released with cuts, like “The Tin Drum” and Marco Bellocchio's “The Devil Is a Woman,” and Bertolucci's “Luna,” and “Sweet Movie.” All those great ‘70s horny classics that are perverse classics were all censored. I guess I saw “Saló” when I was still a film student, but probably just on a VHS or something.

The other day, I put on the Criterion Blu-ray of the movie, and it automatically played the English dub, which makes it somewhat funny in a way, with these kind of transatlantic accents overlapping the Italian. Wouldn't you say there's something funny about the movie, as horrific as it is?

I think there's a camp element in Pasolini's movie that is somewhat intentional, but camp is tricky that way. For example, Silvana Mangano in “Teorema,” after she fucks two boys in a ditch, and she's sitting in her car and just starts screaming in her car with her big hair and her makeup. It's camp. You can't avoid it. I think “Saló” is more intentionally camp, like the wedding sequence and especially those three older fascists who are in drag and are very over-the-top, theatrical, and perverse. It's not so much “funny haha,” it's “funny perverse.” Even the shit scene, you could find some kind of humor in that, but the overriding implications of the film, the critique of fascism and the decadence and moral bankruptcy of the ruling class, and the fascists, is unavoidably cringe.

 










It's obviously not a sexy movie, but there are naked twinks here. What are your thoughts on the implications of the movie's sexualizing gaze?

When I remade “Teorema” as “The Visitor,” or reimagined it, my idea was to make it extremely pornographic, because my theory is Pasolini was moving in a more pornographic direction with his final trilogy of films… “Saló” is kind of pornographic in a way, but in a double sense of the word, like something being pornographic meaning offensively grotesque, like when you say “that's real estate porn” or whatever; this is like high art porn or kind of fascist porn. I also made a film, “Skin Flick,” about neo-Nazi skinheads, which was a porn, and I was thinking of “Saló” at the same time. They're having explicit sex in the film, so it's kind of a jarring juxtaposition.

Do you feel “Saló” is prescient of our current times? The book was set in the 1700s; the movie is in 1940s fascist Italy. There are archetypes you can locate in people of power today.

Yeah, but it's also timeless, you could say. It's critiquing the corruption of the autocracies and the ruling classes that transcend time. They've been around since the Middle Ages and continue today.

Have you been to the murder site that's now a park memorializing Pasolini?
 










I haven't. My intimacy coordinator on “The Visitor” was born in Ostia. She knows a lot about Pasolini, his death, and the conspiracies. I learned about it from her, and I've seen the death photos, of course, but I haven't done the terror tourism.

Where do you land on the conspiracy of it all?

The thing about Pasolini is there were so many people who wanted him dead. The Catholic mafia wanted him dead. The business community was outraged over “Petrolio,” his last unfinished novel, in which the main character was an oil industry executive and it was partly a critique of the oil industry. He was threatening to make a movie about it as well. There were so many people who wanted to see him dead that it seemed like his death was a little bit too convenient, and also the fact that it happened right after his most controversial film before it was even released. That seems a little fishy. And the fact that he knew Ostia so well and had hundreds of experiences like that before, and it had never happened before. 

So who knows? Wasn't it suspicious he was run over so many times? It was such overkill and such a kind of weird spectacle, almost like sending a message.

IndieWire's ‘70s Week is presented by Bleecker Street's “RELAY.” Riz Ahmed plays a world class “fixer” who specializes in brokering lucrative payoffs between corrupt corporations and the individuals who threaten their ruin. IndieWire calls “RELAY” “sharp, fun, and smartly entertaining from its first scene to its final twist, ‘RELAY' is a modern paranoid thriller that harkens back to the genre's '70s heyday.” From director David Mackenzie (“Hell or High Water”) and also starring Lily James, in theaters August 22.

Coming off a roaring premiere at Sundance, Alex Russell celebrated the Los Angeles premiere of his directorial debut “Lurker” on Wednesday, August 20, just a couple days before the whirlwind thriller releases in theaters. The film takes a close look at the twisted, and often deranged, nature of celebrity in Los Angeles. Théodore Pellerin plays Matthew, a socially-obsessed videographer who becomes entangled with a rising pop star, Oliver (Archie Madekwe).

Russell, who comes from the TV world as a writer and producer on “The Bear,” as well as a producer on “Beef,” says he had a lot to learn coming over to the film side. “Well, the indie film world is like the Wild West,” he told IndieWire.

“Years go by, you don't know if it's going to get made, it falls apart, comes back together, you have a different cast, you have a different crew, you have a different script, and you go to a festival raw — it's a huge gamble. Everyone spent all this money. You don't know if anyone cares about this movie or if it's terrible, and then maybe you'll leave with distribution.” MUBI ended up purchasing the film out of the festival in a reported mid-seven-figure deal. 

 










The film features original music, produced with help from the likes of Kenny Beats, Dijon, and Rex Orange County. Though the latter was rumored to be an inspiration for the film's chart-topper, Russell prefers to keep any direct real-life inspiration mysterious. “It's anyone you think that would be on the playlist.”

“Dominic Fike was an inspiration, [but] not as a person, really, just as a figure,” Russell continued. “We really had to beat the allegations of this being about one person in particular, because that would have, I think, really shrunk the scope of it all. The more we worked on it with Archie, the more it just became well disguised, like an amalgam of all these different artists. It also made it unique enough where he could just be his own thing, but it took some time. In the script he was [originally] written as an American.”

Pellerin and Madekwe reunited here following both of them appearing in Ari Aster's “Beau Is Afraid” in 2023. However, they never met while filming that project. “We didn't, I'm there for one second,” Pellerin joked. Both actors jumped at the chance to work with Russell, praising the joys of being able to work with a first-time director. “The way that he directed us was very, very surprising, especially for a first-time director,” Pellerin said.

 










“I was very, very surprised by him,” he continued. “I loved how he directed us. He was never making us feel like we had to achieve one thing in particular. I know it kind of is a trope, a little bit, for actors to talk about freedom in acting, but it's really true that he was directing us in a way that felt like, ‘Now try this and now try that.' I think it was testament to how great of a writer he is, because I think he was rewriting the scenes as new elements [evolved], which is the reality of fiction coming into play, and I just loved it.”

“The biggest lesson I've learned from Alex is that you really have to go into something trusting your filmmaker, trusting your director,” Madekwe recalled. “Alex had never made a film before and this film could have been so many different things. It could have not worked in so many different ways, but I just had full faith in Alex as a filmmaker, as a person, as a human, as an artist, and I knew what he wanted to make. It paid off.” 

Zack Fox, long-time friend of Russell, plays Swett, a close friend in Oliver's entourage who often makes fun of Matthew. While the director was writing the film during the pandemic, he tapped Fox to see if he had an interest in playing a role in the feature. “The way he brought me into it was just like, ‘Hey, I'm writing this movie about the past 10 years of my life, in and around music and entertainment people, and I have this character that I think you would be perfect to play.' When he initially sent me the script, I felt attacked, because I was like, ‘Swett is a bully. ls this how you see me?' And he was just like, ‘No, but I trust you as an actor to bring this forth, because I had seen some of the real-life references.”

 










Earlier this year, Fox made a cameo in Doechii's music video for “Denial Is a River” as “the old dude from 2019.” 

“I have to give credit where credit is due,” he said about being pulled into that. “It was 100% made possible by Cam Hicks and Justin Grant, AKA Sushiboy Mexico, they brought me into the fold. My job as an actor is just to pull up and shoot the ball where you tell me to shoot it, so hopefully I knocked it out of the park.”

MUBI will release “Lurker” in theaters August 22. Check out the trailer here.

Brent Hinds, the former lead guitarist and co-vocalist of Mastodon, died in a motorcycle crash in Atlanta Wednesday night (August 21), local news outlets report. Hinds was riding a Harley Davidson when an SUV failed to yield at a turning, causing a fatal collision, according to Atlanta News First and an Atlanta police memo. Hinds was 51 years old.

William Brent Hinds grew up in Birmingham, Alabama, where he learned the banjo as a teenager and picked up the fret-tapping technique he would later bring to bear on the electric guitar. He was “a total hellion, straight outta hell, with red eyes and everythin',” he told The Guardian's Stevie Chick in 2009. “I was very dysfunctional at school, just a jackass. I'd take LSD and come to class still tripping. I was too creative, never doing my homework, just filling my notepad up with drawings of skulls.”

He moved to Atlanta in the mid 1990s, where he met future Mastodon bandmate Troy Sanders and joined his band Four Hour Fogger. After that group's dissolution, the duo sought to form another, eventually picking up drummer Brann Dailor and guitarist Bill Kelliher to form Mastodon at the dawn of the 2000s.

Their 2002 debut album, Remission, on which Hinds and Sanders traded lead vocals and songwriting duties over virtuosic, hardcore-infused metal, caused a sensation in heavy music circles. But it was the 2004 successor, the Moby Dick concept LP Leviathan, that elevated them to the upper echelons of metal, among both fans and critics. The studio follow-up, 2007's Blood Mountain, earned them a Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance. The band's inventive, progressive tendencies came to the fore on subsequent LPs, starting with 2009's Crack the Skye—which introduced Dailor to the band's suite of lead vocalists—and 2011's The Hunter, which was dedicated to Hinds' late brother. Their final studio albums with Hinds were 2014's relatively radio-friendly Once More 'Round the Sun, the course-correcting Emperor of Sand in 2017 (which won their first Grammy, for Best Metal Performance), and the 2021 double-album Hushed and Grim.

Hinds' unceremonious departure from the band was revealed this year. Though the band's own announcement was cordial, Hinds later said he was “kicked out” and called his former bandmates “horrible humans” in Instagram comments. He continued to perform live around Atlanta in bands such as Fiend Without a Face, West End Motel, and Dirty B & the Boys.

Soon after the news broke, Mastodon wrote a tribute to their former bandmate on social media:

We are in a state of unfathomable sadness and grief… last night Brent Hinds passed away as a result of a tragic accident. We are heartbroken, shocked, and still trying to process the loss of this creative force with whom we've shared so many triumphs, milestones, and the creation of music that has touched the hearts of so many. Our hearts are with Brent's family, friends, and fans. At this time, we please ask that you respect everyone's privacy during this difficult time.

RIP Brent

Despite how unlikely it may have seemed decades ago, when they were best known for their singer jumping on Korn's Ice Cube cover and their own Top 40 hit about shoving things, Deftones are now among the most respected and influential bands of the 1990s. When they debuted with Adrenaline in 1995, they weren't even the best rock band with an awkward rapper in the city of Sacramento; they were, like so many young men of their time, joined on stage and in the studio by a DJ.

Now, Hayley Williams is joining the band on stage to sing “Minerva”; we're a full decade past the days of Deafheaven and Nothing using their tricks on black metal and shoegaze; the nation's indie venues are lousy with bands playing drop-D punisher riffs while hoodied frontmen whisper about violent sex. Venture onto Reddit and find it clogged with people arguing about whether Deftones are nu-metal or shoegaze and the sociological implications of how you personally answer that question. Last summer, they mounted a nationwide arena tour despite their last album coming out before the Covid vaccines. The Los Angeles Times, reviewing the first of two sold-out shows in Inglewood, called them “Gen Z's favorite heavy rock band.” The oldest members of Gen Z are two years younger than Adrenaline.

Deftones' dramatic shift in reputation from nu-metal B-listers to avant-rock heroes has less to do with their artistic growth (considerable though it may be) than it does with the evolution of how people who like to think about rock music feel about heaviness, romance, the primacy of our emotional life, and having a body generally. You can theorize about that change if you want, but these are the conditions in which private music, the first Deftones album since 2020's excellent Ohms, exists. Green Day and the Foo Fighters might play to bigger crowds, Korn and System of a Down might have a greater nostalgic pull. But to find another artist from the 1990s whose influence has only grown and is still making records at a high level, you probably have to start thinking about Deftones as being in a category with Radiohead (who haven't made a record in a decade) and Björk (who, despite her continued popularity, is not doing multiple nights at the Forum). They are, against all odds, elite.

How did they get here, to arguably the height of their popularity, 25 years after the release of their best-selling album? private music—like A Moon Shaped Pool and Fossora—is unlikely to draw in unconvinced listeners, but like those records, it shows them fully in control of their instantly recognizable sound, able to effortlessly bend it around whatever structures they put in its place. Following an interlude that sounds like Tim Hecker sighing through a hurdy-gurdy, “cXz” has the kind of dreamy chorus that singer Chino Moreno can by now probably write in his literal dreams. Rather than let it soar cloudward on a thick rocket of sound, though, the band rattles into a momentum-shifting staccato led by drummer Abe Cunningham. It's a subtle little thing, but the tension makes the song feel itchy and impatient without sacrificing its beauty. The discomfiting comfort in Deftones' music often comes from its treatment of heaviness and prettiness—a great Deftones song can feel like an arduous hike to a stunning vista that reveals a violent storm on the horizon—but this pull in the song's textures makes it feel like it's urging you away from the payoff it promised to give you.

While much has been made of the supposed war of taste between Moreno (the heartthrob and aesthete! He loves Pantha du Prince and Tortoise!) and guitarist Stephen Carpenter (the metalhead! He wears cargo shorts in videos and seems like he'd rather be in Fear Factory!), they're both equally comfortable working anywhere between the two poles of their sound. Carpenter plays a riff in “locked club” that wants to grunt and groove, but it sounds like Carpenter is lightly flicking the string with his thumb, so that the riff feels both heavy and soft simultaneously. And Moreno is also more aggressive and pissy than he has been in decades, sounding at times like Joe Casey from Protomartyr or Kendrick Lamar doing his “squabble up” wise-guy sneer. In “cut hands,” an honest-to-god rap-metal song and honest-to-god highlight, he's swaggering around, commanding, a tetchy lounge singer jabbing his martini glass at the audience, taunting.

Like every Deftones record since their ludicrously expensive, self-titled album in 2003, private music sounds incredible, done up like the 4K sexy violence of a John Wick film. The gloss of the production allows the lean “milk of the madonna” to slide past with a luxurious efficiency, while it gives a sheen of heavenly valediction to the chorus of “infinite source” that amplifies the sense of benevolent finality at the song's center. Frank Delgado—the onetime DJ who now plays a role like Mission of Burma's Martin Swope, manipulating noise and painting chilly watercolors in the background of most of these songs—processes Carpenter's guitar to sound like a purring rotary phone dial in “departing the body,” the album's swaying closer. While Carpenter has made no secret of his love for Meshuggah, the sparkling detail of private music, the loving way the album lingers on thick, sustained chords for a beat longer than seems natural, like it's trying to tear itself away from a Rothko, means part of the album's pleasure comes from his pure devotion to tone, Sunn O))) with certified-platinum pop instincts.

Finding new ways of playing heavy music softly, transforming depression into beautiful aggression—these are fresh iterations of the odd inversions at the center of Deftones' artistic success. It can still be difficult to determine where they belong, and thus how to understand them: Are they the blushing romantics of the Family Values Tour? Are they humble heirs to the emotional grunge-gaze of Swervedriver and Hum with a few misguided raps buried in the back catalogue? What are you supposed to think about this music? A nu-metal band writing about darkness as a source of triumph is no more unique than—or all that different from—a shoegaze band locating the signal of angelic harmony in the midst of abyssal noise. Still, something unique happens when all of these sources of heaviness—musical and emotional—are plugged in and allowed to feed back into one another. What is it? Deftones have been trying to solve this riddle for thirty years, since the very first song on their very first album. They've never sounded more at ease with not knowing the answer.

With history's clock spinning backwards on so many civic fronts, the current market for retro-fetishism is, honestly, a bit disturbing. Yet there's an undeniable pleasure principle in what Miranda Lambert calls “Old Shit”—and the escape it promises from our pixilated lives feels more essential than ever.

There's plenty of precedent for Laufey Lín Bing Jónsdóttir's revivalist pre-rock pop. Linda Ronstadt's 1983 What's New and its sequels, orchestrated by Frank Sinatra wingman Nelson Riddle, signified similarly in the conservative-backlash Reagan years. Laufey's compatriot Björk cut the feral vocal-jazz gem Gling-Gló, predicting her big band-y 1995 solo breakout, “It's Oh So Quiet.” Amy Winehouse perfected her own retro-modernism prior to a Tony Bennett collab. Mitski, Mei Semones, and Lana Del Rey are all putting old styles to vital new uses.

What's most charming about Laufey, alongside her undeniable mastery of the Great American Songbook traditions she's steeped in, is the way she alternately indulges, interrogates, and goofs on them. This was clear straightway, her conservatory-kid bedroom indie-pop steez fully formed on a pandemic TikTok rollout that linked standards like “I Fall in Love Too Easily” to Billie Eilish's “My Future” and her own casually f-bombing originals. Starting with “Valentine” (“I've rejected affection/For years and years/Now I have it, and damn it/It's kind of weird”), her best songs play Gen-Z colloquial overshares off elegant music that would be mere craft without the frisson between words and couture—by turns comic, tragic, or both.

The best moments of the maximalist A Matter of Time dial that frisson up. The sleeve telegraphs it, too—a sly riff on the sexy cover of Julie London's 1960 LP Around Midnight that suggests Laufey's going harder than her beloved musky-voiced predecessor (her bare legs on the clock face suggest we're deep into the wee hours). On “Snow White,” a third-person “Jolene” narrative is set to sweeping orchestral strings that, in style and sentiment, might fit into any mid-century musical. What's new, in this context, is the raw self-awareness, the inescapability of shame despite the smart cultural critique we frame it with. “I don't think I'm pretty/It's not up for debate/A woman's best currency's her body, not her brain,” she sings, with vertiginous breathlessness. “The world is a sick place/At least for a girl.”

It's the record's most powerful moment, showcasing a depth of emotion her technically remarkable singing doesn't often access. But that's not always the goal. “Silver Lining,” sung exactingly and with delightful flourishes, could almost be an Amy Winehouse slow jam, but the unblemished perfection of the delivery seems part of the track's comic subversiveness. “I've been falling in bad habits, staring into the abyss/Drowning in red wine and sniffing cinnamon,” she sings, with just enough pause before “cinnamon” for the joke to land.

Humor's among Laufey's strong suits, and she's funniest when she's at her most cloying. Album opener “Clockwork” questions the wisdom of dating friends over a backdrop worthy of the Anita Kerr Singers, rhyming “said he's running late” with “he probably had to regurgitate.” The playfully fizzy “Lover Girl,” punctuated with chipper handclaps, is incongruously hard-spitting, and gets bonus points for the ramen-joint choreography in its video clip. “Tough Luck” is a toxic boyfriend brush-off that nods to Taylor and Gaga, with low-key burns that ratchet up deliciously. “I should congratulate thee for so nearly convincing me/I'm not quite as smart as I seem,” she tells her newly minted ex, waiting until the bridge to finally rhyme the title with “fuck.” Girl's a class act.

As in his work with Taylor Swift, Aaron Dessner helps Laufey change wardrobe (on “Castle in Hollywood” and “A Cautionary Tale”) to lean into less mannered storytelling. But formal dress suits her best, at least on this set, which is the fullest expression of the Cinemascope songcraft that's got her selling out arenas, ostensibly to a fan base that include Gen X parents as well as their kids; probably grandparents, too. And if A Matter of Time leaves you wanting a little more in the tortured poets department, well, there are enough signs here (e.g. the Bernard Herrmann meets George Crumb outbursts on “Sabotage”) that it isn't outside Laufey's wheelhouse.

To be a clown is to be vulnerable, innocent, foolish. “The clown falls so we don't have to,” a common adage goes; the clown performs our fears and our weaknesses so that we can laugh at them together. There's power in that naive outlook: by making themselves ridiculous through costuming and physicality, clowns allow us to embrace the awkward, the uncomfortable, the tragic—in other words, the daily routine for the average woman barreling into adulthood. On her debut album, Who's the Clown, Los Angeles-based writer and musician Audrey Hobert plays the fool, drawing out the minute details of her dating foibles and deepest insecurities. She falls so we don't have to.

Hobert first gained recognition from her work with her childhood best friend, Gracie Abrams, co-writing several songs for Abrams' 2024 album The Secret of Us, including its breakout hit, “That's so True.” She didn't set out to be a songwriter; she studied screenwriting in college and wrote on two seasons of her father's Nickelodeon show, The Really Loud House. But her work on Abrams' record landed her a publishing deal, so Hobert started working as a session songwriter for other artists. Soon, she realized she preferred the hyper-personal experience of writing for herself and her close friends. She partnered with producer Ricky Gourmet, who worked on Finneas' 2024 album For Cryin' Out Loud!, and began piecing together the songs that would become her debut album.

The songs on Who's the Clown fittingly sound like an extension of Abrams' world: verbose, conversational, unfiltered. Hobert sings like she's getting paid by the syllable, fitting mouthfuls like “Not that it matters/But I'm breaking patterns/And getting so good at pilates” on album single “Sue Me,” into shockingly few measures, matching the syncopated beat of the drum machine backing her. On the breezy, guitar-driven “Wet Hair,” she nearly loses grasp of the English language entirely as she manages to sing “over-thinker but it's OK” in under two seconds. It's instructive here, perhaps, to remember the pop music that Hobert and Abrams grew up with: “You were eating a burrito” pop, “You ask me why I change the color of my hair” pop. These women were chatty, slightly neurotic, girlish and goofy, backed by midi guitar and minimal percussion—fun and play were primary, sexiness or glamor hardly a concern.

But the album falters in its second half, where Hobert uses specificity as a crutch, struggling to transcend the biographical details of her own, quite exceptional, life. It's hard to feel sorry for her on “Chateau” as she complains about rubbing shoulders with industry insiders at the titular Hollywood landmark. And on “Phoebe,” she relates her own struggles with accepting her appearance to Lisa Kudrow's character in Friends, who is conspicuously single for much of the series. But if Hobert had finished the show, she'd know that Phoebe ended up with a thoughtful pianist named Mike, played by universal heartthrob Paul Rudd (in his vows, he even says how much he loves that she's “so wonderfully weird”!). It's an apt metaphor for the weaker moments on the record, confessions from someone who hasn't fully finished growing up yet.

As court jester, Hobert pokes fun at the desperation inherent in being human: “Sue me, I want to be wanted!” “I like to touch people!” She acts out so that we can nod and laugh in recognition, plainly stating the desires we've been socially conditioned to hold back. “So wrong to think everyone loves me/And they need to be around me all the time,” she sings on “Bowling Alley.” The unexpectedly catchy single about the classic internal debate between spending another night in or going to the big party finds the clown in extremes: She's not just staying in, she's in a nightgown and a sleeping cap; she's not just at the party, she's the life of the party, bowling strikes to cheers from the crowd. When she's able to escape the particulars of her world, Hobert has a knack for exploding small moments of anxiety or excitement into wonderfully playful, grotesque pop. Too often, though, she stops short, comfortable using personal details as shorthands for broad feelings. On Who's the Clown, Hobert mines her own life for laughs—she might just need to live a bit more of it first.

Jack White is a longtime critic of President Donald J. Trump and his administration, and the musician has even taken legal action against the politician and his campaign. The latest chapter in the saga of White vs. White House came earlier this week when the White Stripes rocker insulted Trump's redecoration of the Oval Office, saying that it now looks like “a vulgar, gold leafed and gaudy, professional wrestler's dressing room.” The barb elicited a response from Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, who told The Daily Beast that White is “a washed up, has-been loser posting drivel on social media because he clearly has ample time on his hands due to his stalled career.”

Cheung further defended his boss' aesthetic choices, telling the outlet: “It's apparent he's been masquerading as a real artist, because he fails to appreciate, and quite frankly disrespects, the splendor and significance of the Oval Office inside of ‘The People's House.'”

The war of words continued yesterday (August 20), with White sharing a lengthy statement against Trump and his administration on Instagram. White criticized Trump's “blatant fascist manipulation of government, his gestapo ICE tactics, his racist remarks about Latinos, Native Americans, etc. his ridiculous ‘wall' construction, his attacks on the disabled, his attempted coup and mob insurrection and destruction of the sacred halls of congress,” and plenty more. He went on to use Cheung's words against Trump, writing that the president “is masquerading as a human being,” and “masquerading as a christian, as a leader, as a person with actual empathy.”

Several artists—including Margo Price and Michigander's Jason Singer—have supported White in the comments on his post. “You hit a fuckin' nerve ‘cuz they don't put out statements this length for earthquakes and shootings,” Patton Oswalt wrote. “Keep going.” Cat Power's Chan Marshall added, “LOVE YOU JACK❤️‍🔥.”

Sydney Sweeney doesn't regret selling soap made from her used bathwater. In a new interview with The Wall Street Journal, the Euphoria actress said it was primarily women who had an issue with her decision. 


	“I think it's important to have a finger on the pulse of what people are saying, because everything is a conversation with the audience,” she said, adding, “It was mainly the girls making comments about it, which I thought was really interesting. They all loved the idea of Jacob Elordi's bathwater.”


	Earlier this year, the actress has teamed with Dr. Squatch, manufacturer of “natural manly soap,” for a new bar called Sydney's Bathwater Bliss. “We created a limited-edition soap infused with her ACTUAL bathwater,” the company said in a social media post. “Why? Because y'all wouldn't stop asking. And Sydney said, ‘Let's do it.'” It hit stores in June. 


	Sweeney confirmed to WSJ that Dr. Squatch since sold to Unilever for $1.5 billion, although she refused to confirm whether she had any equity in the company. But when asked if she was thinking strategically, she said, “Yes. Very.”

	During the interview, Sweeney refused to answer any questions about her recent controversy with American Eagle, attending the wedding of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez, or her personal life. She also wouldn't say if there's anyone in Hollywood she views as a mentor. “I've always said that I look up to the older version of myself,” she said. “So I'm hoping that whatever I'm doing now, 40-year-old Sydney will be proud of.” (She did note that her Euphoria character Cassie remains “crazy.”)

	











	Last month, American Eagle debuted a new denim ad featuring Sweeney with the tagline “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.” The decision to center the promos around the “jeans” and “genes” homophone has turned the campaign into a culture-war flashpoint. It was exacerbated by the fact that Sweeney was, through no fault of her own, already a culture-war flashpoint thanks to the weird, often creepy politicization of her body, especially by those on the right.

	Pairing Sweeney — who has blonde hair and blue eyes — with the tagline “has great jeans/genes” has led some on the left to accuse the campaign of subtly (or not-so-subtly) dog-whistling eugenics and white supremacy. Meanwhile, some on the right are celebrating the campaign for allegedly doing just that, calling the spots yet another harbinger of the death of woke.


	Sweeney previously addressed the way others have politicized her appearance, telling NME last year, “There's not anything I can do.” She added: “I think it's important to be aware of everything and then use that information however I may well. But I'm just being me, that's all.”

	All together now: the Beatles' classic Anthology documentary is finally getting a long-awaited new edition. The new Anthology is restored, remastered, and expanded—the full story of the Beatles, in the words of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr themselves. The original eight-episode series was a worldwide sensation when it premiered on TV in November 1995, as were all three companion albums. The lavish book arrived in 2000. The full Anthology phenomenon — on screen, on record, in print — is the most comprehensive version of the Beatles' tale ever told.


	The new nine-part Anthology will be streaming on Disney+, beginning November 26. It now has a brand-new Episode Nine, featuring unseen footage of the surviving three Beatles working on the original documentary in 1994 and 1995. The music has also been expanded with a new Anthology 4 album, out November 21. Pre-order Now 


	Apple has restored the documentary with Peter Jackson's Wingnut Films & Park Road Post teams, along with Giles Martin, who has done new mixes of the music. It's excellent news for fans, since they've spent years clamoring for a restored edition. The original doc was a bestseller on home video, but hasn't been available for streaming. The Beatles Anthology book will get a new 25th Anniversary Edition, out October 14. Pre-order Now












	Giles Martin has remastered the Anthology albums, but the bombshell is the new Anthology 4, with 36 tracks, including 13 previously unreleased outtakes and demos, on vinyl, CD, and digital audio. It includes never-heard versions of classics like “In My Life,” “Nowhere Man,” “If I Fell,” and “I've Just Seen a Face.” There's also an unreleased rehearsal for the BBC broadcast of “All You Need Is Love.” Pre-Save and pre-Order Now












	The Nineties Anthology albums had a classic introduction from Derek Taylor, the band's longtime friend, publicist, and confidant. He famously proclaimed the Beatles “the twentieth century's greatest romance.” Beautiful words — but he had no way of knowing that thirty years later, the world's romance with the Beatles would be more passionate than ever. Anthology is a key part of how that happened. It became a global event that blew up their popularity to new levels, firing up a whole generation of young fans.

Anthology was a radical approach to the story — no narrator, no talking heads, just the lads themselves, up close and personal, with loads of unseen footage that fans hadn't even imagined. It follows the whole epic Beatles saga, from their early days in Liverpool to their black-leather nights in Hamburg, through their years of innovation and experimentation, right up to the band's demise and John Lennon's death. The surviving Fabs speak their minds more candidly than ever before, as they recall living through the insane global explosion of Beatlemania and their U.S. invasion. As George says, “They used us as an excuse to go mad, the world did, and then blamed it on us.” 


Anthology was a turning point in the Beatles' afterlife. It proved once and for all that their ever-increasing popularity had nothing to do with nostalgia, but everything to do with how this music spoke to the current moment, as it does thirty years later. It's full of classic scenes that became a permanent part of Beatles lore, including the emotional moments where all three sit on the grass, strumming and singing together. In one much-loved scene, Paul responds to the long-running debate over whether the White Album was too long. He's really diplomatic about it. “It was great!” Paul replies. “It sold! It's the bloody Beatles' White Album! Shut up!” 


	But the albums were as crucial to the Anthology phenomenon as the film. Their legendary producer George Martin did the three double-CD packages, with his teenage son Giles as his apprentice. All three volumes were full of previously unreleased gems from the archives—outtakes, demos, live clips, studio chatter. (“Paul's broken a glass!”) It was the first time they'd ever opened up the vaults to share some of the treasures that had been sitting unheard all these years.

	Crazy as it seems now, nobody in 1995 was sure if the audience wanted to hear any of this. But the albums became blockbuster hits, shocking the music industry. It turned out people were hungry for more Beatles, far hungrier than the experts had realized — especially the young fans just discovering this band. The world was in the middle of the Nineties music revolution—modern rock, Britpop, electronica, hip-hop — with the Beatles more influential than ever. These albums began the series of ace archival projects over the past decade, starting with the pivotal deluxe editions of Sgt. Pepper and the White Album, as well as films like Eight Days A Week: The Touring Years, Beatles '64, and Peter Jackson's Get Back. 

	











	The Nineties Anthology included a pair of new songs, “Free as a Bird” and “Real Love,” based on John Lennon's 1970s demos, recorded at home in the Dakota. Paul, George, and Ringo completed them in the studio for Anthology. Both became international hits, despite the major technical limitations of John's original tapes. But both have been redone by original producer Jeff Lynne, using the “de-mixing” technology pioneered in Jackson's Get Back film and the final Beatles song, “Now and Then.” The “Free As a Bird” music video has been restored both visually and sonically. 


	The complete albums will be available as 12-LP box set on 180-gram vinyl, and an 8-CD box set, from Apple Corps Ltd./Capitol/UMG — 191 tracks in all. They'll also be released digitally, for both purchase and streaming. The Beatles Store has exclusive editions of both sets, including four 12-inch band-photo art cards in numbered envelopes. The boxes include the original sleeve notes as well as new notes from band scholar Kevin Howlett. 


	The Anthology book will be issued in a new softcover edition from Apple Corps Ltd./Chronicle Books. It has the massive size of a coffee-table book, but it's considerably more than that — it's a landmark of Fabs history in itself. It goes even deeper than the series, with in-depth commentary from all three that didn't fit into the screen version, as well as fresh interviews conducted specifically for the book. All three surviving Beatles granted access to their private archives, while the Lennon commentary and photos come from all over his public and private archives. The consulting editor was Derek Taylor, who worked on it until his death in 1997. He didn't live to see it, but he would have loved seeing how “the twentieth century's greatest romance” was about to get even hotter in the next century.


	In the Anthology book, Lennon talks about the childhood dream life that helped inspire “Free As a Bird.” “One recurrent dream, all through my life, was the flying bit,” he recalled in 1971. “I'd always fly in time of danger. I remember it as a child, flying around, like swimming in the air. I'd be swimming round where I lived or somewhere I knew very well usually. The other times in dreams I remember are nightmarish, where there'd be a giant horse or something and whenever it would get near to a danger point I would fly away.”


	Flight was always a fantasy for him. “Some of my most vivid dreams were about me being in a plane, flying over a certain part of Liverpool. It as when I was at school. The plane used to fly over time and time again, going higher and higher.” What John Lennon and his bandmates did with those dreams transformed the world. That's the flight they took together — and that's the story all four Beatles are telling in Anthology.

Donald Trump wants another criminal back on the streets.


	The president on Thursday morning called for Tina Peters — a convicted felon currently serving a nine-year sentence for crimes related to her effort to prove the 2020 election was fraudulent — to be released from prison, threatening “harsh measures” if the state of Colorado doesn't comply with his demand.


	“FREE TINA PETERS, a brave and innocent Patriot who has been tortured by Crooked Colorado politicians, including the big Mail-In Ballot supporting the governor of the State,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Let Tina Peters out of jail, RIGHT NOW. She did nothing wrong, except catching the Democrats cheat in the Election.” 


	“She is an old woman, and very sick,” the president added. “If she is not released, I am going to take harsh measures!!!”


	Peters, a former clerk in Mesa County, Colorado, was convicted last year on seven charges related to a plot to grant unauthorized individuals access to county voting machines, as part of efforts to prove an unfounded conspiracy theory that the 2020 election was rigged against Trump. Peters was also arrested in 2022 for attempting to kick a cop serving a search warrant in connection with allegations that she had illegally recorded a court hearing for one of her deputies involved in the election security breach.

	Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold responded to Trump's call for Peters to be released in a statement provided to Rolling Stone. “Donald Trump and Tina Peters are election-denying criminals who put their need for power ahead of the American people,” she wrote. “Trump's feeble attempts to put pressure on the justice system to re-write history is an embarrassment. While he keeps digging himself lower and lower to free a criminal convicted by a jury of her peers, I will continue to uphold the law and our free and fair elections.”

	











	Griswold supported the ultimately unsuccessful effort to keep Trump's name off Colorado election ballots, citing the 14th Amendment, which prohibits insurrectionists from holding office, and Trump's role in fomenting a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. (The conservative-dominated Supreme Court let Trump off the hook, while gutting the 14th Amendment.)

Rolling Stone reported last year that Griswold saw a 600-percent spike in threats in the wake of the state's lawsuit to keep Trump off the ballot, and that she even needed extra security as she gave birth later in the year.

	The president's call to release Peters comes as he works to tilt the scales of democracy ahead of the 2026 midterms. On Monday, he announced an unconstitutional effort to eliminate mail-in voting across America, and Wednesday night he celebrated the state of Texas gerrymandering its electoral map in order to give Republicans additional seats in the House of Representatives. “Big WIN for the Great State of Texas!!!” he wrote, adding that “more seats equals less Crime, a great Economy, and a STRONG SECOND AMENDMENT. It means Happiness and Peace.”


	Trump's concern for crime doesn't apply to his supporters, of course. One of his first acts as president was pardoning the rioters who stormed the Capitol to try to keep him in office — including those who assaulted law enforcement. Peters is a felon, but because, like the rioters, her crimes were committed in service of Trump's push to subvert the results of a democratic election, the president believes she is a “brave and innocent Patriot,” and is threatening retribution unless she is set free.

	Brent Hinds, the co-founder of Grammy-winning heavy metal group Mastodon who played with the group for 25 years before his departure earlier this year, died on Wednesday. He was 51.


	Brian Jost Reents, Deputy Chief Medical Examiner Investigator of the of the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office, confirmed Hinds' death to Rolling Stone. According to local news outlet Atlanta News First, Hinds was killed in a motorcycle accident in Atlanta when his Harley Davidson collided with a SUV.


	The Atlanta Police Department added that the accident occurred around 11:35 p.m. “Upon arrival, officers located an unresponsive male who was involved in the collision,” the report stated. “The male appeared to be operating a Harley Davidson during the time of collision. Medical personnel pronounced the male deceased.” A preliminary investigation concluded that the driver of the SUV “failed to yield while turning left and collided” into Hinds. “The investigation remains active at this time.”

	











	Hinds co-founded the Grammy-winning group in 2000 with bassist Troy Sanders, guitarist Bill Kelliher, and drummer Brann Dailor. In March, the band announced that they parted ways with the guitarist. “We're deeply proud of and beyond grateful for the music and history we've shared and we wish him nothing but success and happiness in his future endeavors,” the band wrote.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“We are in a state of unfathomable sadness and grief,” the band wrote on social media. “Last night Brent Hinds passed away as a result of a tragic accident. We are heartbroken, shocked, and still trying to process the loss of this creative force with whom we've shared so many triumphs, milestones, and the creation of music that has touched the hearts of so many. Our hearts are with Brent's family, friends, and fans. At this time, we please ask that you respect everyone's privacy during this difficult time.”

	











	The lineup of Hinds, Sanders, Dailor, and Kelliher recorded eight studio albums together over the past 25 years, including their 2002 debut Remission, 2009 mainstream breakthrough Crack the Skye, and their most recent LP, 2021's Hushed and Grim.

Leviathan, the band's critically acclaimed 2004 album, was named one of Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time, with single “Blood and Thunder” earning a spot on the 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Songs of All Time. 


	“Mastodon were like sailors as we drove around and played basements and clubs for years,” Tailor told Modern Drummer of Leviathan. “We were on a quest for something that might not even be there, and we were sacrificing a lot by leaving our families and friends behind. It was a mixture of Ahab's craziness and Ishmael's lust for life and adventure.”


	“The listener is buffeted by surging waves of guitars, guttural screams and relentless squalls of drum fills,” Rolling Stone wrote of the album. “Deeper tracks like the fully unhinged ‘Megalodon' and the slow-building opus ‘Hearts Alive' only drag us deeper into Mastodon's dark sound and vision.”


	They won their first Grammy in 2018 for Best Metal Performance for “Sultan's Curse.” The group earned six Grammy nominations total, including Best Rock Album for 2017's Emperor of Sand.

I
t happened earlier this month the same way it always happens. Jesse Welles was scrolling on his cell at home in northwest Arkansas — Siloam Springs, population 21,000 — when he came across a recruitment ad for the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE to most of us).


	“I thought, ‘Well, that sounds like a great use of my time,'” he says drolly. Putting down his phone, Welles mulled over the subject, opened a Google doc, and began tapping out lyrics written in the voice of a bottled-up ICE agent: “There's a hole in my soul that just rages/Well, the ladies turned me down/And told me I was a clown/Well, won't you look at me now/I'm putting folks in cages.”


	Welles grabbed one of his acoustic guitars, set his words to a plucky folk melody, and eventually made his way to a nearby city park. To ensure as little background noise as possible, he headed for his preferred spot on a hill where the wind doesn't blow so hard. Setting up his phone, pointed at himself, he began singing in a voice that evoked both Kurt Cobain's anguish and John Prine's wry mischievousness, his floor mop of hair bobbing back and forth to the beat. In no time, the new song “Join ICE” was on Welles' social feeds, eventually racking up more than 1 million views.

	











	Score another viral hit for Welles, and another step in the comeback of the protest song.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	With Donald Trump's return to the White House, the topical, off-the-news song has staged a minor comeback. Search long enough on TikTok or Instagram and you'll stumble across outraged songwriters addressing the disarrayed state of the nation in homemade videos. But few, if any, are doing it as frequently and with as much of a social media impact as Welles.

	











	Over the last year and a half, the 32-year-old has dashed off a barrage of outraged, barbed, or mocking songs about the mass casualties in Gaza (“War Isn't Murder”), the Biden-Trump debate (“The Olympics”), the sorry state of healthcare in America (“United Health,” “Cancer”), opioid addiction (“Fentanyl”), Russian citizens drafted into the invasion of Ukraine (“How Many Times”), and those mysterious Jeffrey Epstein files (“The List”). And that's just for starters. “It just helped me make sense of what was going on around me,” says Welles in a Zoom call from his home, displaying both his pronounced biceps and a mighty shag that makes him look like a hair-metal dude on a day off. “What you're listening to is me making sense of the news: ‘What is this fentanyl crisis? Let me break it down in terms I can deal with and I'll make it rhyme.'”

	In a world awash in content, few should have noticed. But in a shift that indicates a desire to hear someone, anyone, sing truth to power during the disruptive Trump 2.0 era, Welles turned out to be the right man at the right time. His songs — most  barely two minutes long, perfect for memes and viral moments — have accrued millions of views and largely supportive comments, as seen by the laudatory responses to “Join ICE.” Wrote one fan, “This is a dangerous song because conservatives don't understand irony.” Another: “Been waitin for this, didn't think it would be this fast. You're always spot on but honey, you nailed this.” And this: “Incisive and savage. Great response to the moronic rhetoric and brutal policies of this sick administration.”


	If that scenario sounds familiar, it should. Two years ago, a bearded Virginia troubadour named Oliver Anthony posted a raw-voiced tirade called “Rich Men North of Richmond,” also filmed in the woods and tapping into populist discontent. The song made Anthony a viral sensation, but he proved to be a one-rage wonder.


	So far, Welles has managed to avoid that fate. Unlike Anthony, Welles has been mostly embraced by the more left-leaning Americana and folk world. At last year's Farm Aid, Dave Matthews introduced Welles with, “I think he's one of the best songwriters I've ever heard in my life. … he gives me hope and he's unbelievable.” Both Sierra Ferrell and Billy Strings make appearances on Pilgrim, the insanely prolific Welles' second of three albums released this year.

	Nathaniel Rateliff also began waving the Welles flag. After meeting Welles at Farm Aid last year, the singer, who curated this year's Newport Folk Festival, invited him to join the lineup. “It's nice to hear somebody talk about anything that's going on and calling things out as he sees it,” says Rateliff. “I don't hear anybody in the media on TV talk about what's happening in Washington. So, it's nice for somebody to be literal about what's happening and do it in the form of a song. He's got a real Bernie Sanders approach to a song.”

	











	At Newport, the demand to see Welles was so strong that his set was moved from a smaller side stage to the main one. Thousands watched, in blistering heat, as he played his musical commentaries and some of his even stronger, less overtly political songs, like “Change Is in the Air” and “Horses.” “I think they certainly connected with the ‘young Bob Dylan' aspect of him being a protest songwriter,” Rateliff says. “People are hungry for that in some ways.”


	Every era needs its voice of the people, and through timing, luck, and talent, that person may be Welles. “There's a lot of people protesting different things in their own way, which is a beautiful thing about America, and something we can't forget — that we have the great gift to be able to sing these songs, and I don't have to worry about my life,” he says. “No one will come and kill me.” But like Dylan and others before him, will they look to him for answers?


	THE SIGHT OF WELLES STRUMMING AN ACOUSTIC GUITAR and knocking out ditties wasn't a surprise to Simon Martin. A decade or so ago, when they were friends in Arkansas, the drummer and Welles would hang out on Martin's porch in Fayetteville. “He'd bring a guitar and just play these same little simply folkie chord numbers and make stuff up,” Martin says. “We were sitting around smoking some grass, making jokes, and being stupid, so it's funny to see him out in the woods doing that. Of course, the lyrics are now much more meaningful.”


	The son of a mechanic and schoolteacher, Jesse Allen Breckenbridge Wells, as he was named at birth in 1992, grew up in Arkansas, watching PBS shows on a TV set with what he calls “rabbit ears” and tolerating his sister's love of ‘NSync and Backstreet Boys. He himself was drawn to vintage music — Gladys Knight and the Pips to the Guess Who, he says — by way of the local oldies radio station. In second grade he sang “Twist and Shout” in a talent contest and, by high school, was introduced to Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.


	By his early teens, Welles had discovered the guitar; in an early sign of his clever streak, he started a high school band named the Stimulus Package, after the Obama recession program. When he was about 20, he dubbed himself “Jeh Sea Wells” and began recording and posting his songs on services like SoundCloud. He attended local colleges, earning a degree in music theory, but was working at a local Waffle House when he put an ad on Craigslist looking for band members. Martin responded and, with a bassist, they formed Dead Indian, which reflected one of Welles' obsessions: Nirvana. “Which was already 20 years after the fact,” Welles says of the grunge pioneers. “But listen, if the middle of the country is behind the coasts, then the middle of Arkansas is behind 30 years.”

	











	Over the next few years, Dead Indian put out a few records of next-generation ravaged grunge and played around the area. Welles was already itching to move on. He and Martin started another band, Cosmic American, but a record executive who heard some of his music suggested Welles move to New York, L.A., or Nashville. He chose the latter, which wasn't as far away from Arkansas, and thus began his next group, Welles, adding an extra “e” to his surname.


	Welles' potential as a rocker was clear to Eddie Spears, the producer and engineer who worked with the band Welles and has continued to collaborate with the musician. “Jesse's real quiet and has a calm aura to him,” he says. “But when he got behind a microphone, he had that great raspy, loud angst, at least at that time. He really embodied an amazing anger, like what you imagine John Lennon was like when he was making Plastic Ono Band.”


	Looking back, Welles describes himself as “a 22-year-old whose only ambition from the time I was a teenager was to be signed to a record label.” But that dream didn't pan out. The band Welles scored a gig at Bonnaroo in 2017, released a few EPs and a full album in 2018, and toured a bunch, but the world wasn't especially interested in grunge-metal thrashings. The album went nowhere and Welles found himself back home in Arkansas. “I didn't know what to do,” he says. “I had been playing and touring for about four years, real steady, and Covid knocked everything off the road. All my friends and I, we didn't know what to do. So I said, ‘Well, I know something I can do. I can go back to the country, and I can live cheap out there and regroup.'”


	At first, returning to his home state was, he says, a downer: “I got back to Arkansas and thought, ‘Well, this is the end. I'm quitting.'” But when his father suffered a heart attack (he survived), Welles made a decision that would change his life. “I thought, ‘If he goes right now, I've barely had any time with him,'” he says. “At that point, I decided life was too short and I was just going to write music constantly and put it out with no gatekeepers. I was far enough away from any kind of music-industry thing to make me feel like there were no rules.”


	That summer of 2023, Welles encountered Anthony's “Rich Men North of Richmond” video and was duly inspired. “I saw Chris,” he says, referring to Anthony by his real name, “and I thought, ‘Oh, we can do that.' Good to know. You don't need anything. You can enact change on your own. I loved how green it was; it was pleasant to look at. And I thought, ‘This is the way to go.'”

	











	Two months after “Rich Men North of Richmond,” Welles ventured to that park near his home, pressed record on his phone, and began singing and strumming songs for the camera. At first he stuck with covers by the Beatles, Paul Simon, Nirvana, and Donovan, among many, but as he says, “I was tired of trying to remember the words to the classic-rock tunes, so I thought I would do my songs.”


	Beginning in March 2024, he ventured into his originals, starting with “The Olympics,” a take on the potential rematch between Trump and Joe Biden that captured how exasperated many were at the thought of two boomers duking it out again. (Name-checking “Hotel California,” he sings, “For giving us such amazing music we could almost forgive you for our situation this damn dire.”) “I was taking all my cues from a Guthrie standpoint,” Welles says. “I've always, from a young age, liked Woody Guthrie, but I didn't understand when I was a boy that it was subversive, like a truth vessel hidden in a fun song.”


	The song would eventually accrue more than 1.4 million views on TikTok and signaled a new era for Welles. That same month, his manager partnered with Q Prime, the high-power management firm whose various divisions rep everyone from Metallica and Greta Van Fleet to Eric Church and Ashley McBryde. “I still don't know what the big deal is,” Welles insists. “I just knew as soon as people liked ‘The Olympics,' I thought, ‘Well, you have to do better than that, and you have to do better than the next one, and you have to do better than the next one. You've got a lot of work to do, mister.' That's what I reckoned.”


	The way many people gravitated toward what he's called his “new iteration” does appear to have taken Welles by surprise. Last year, he attended an Arkansas show by Rateliff and the Night Sweats, and Rateliff learned more about Welles' background, the origin of his woodsy videos, and how Welles was adjusting to his new role. “He was like, ‘That's not really what I do, though — I was in all these, like, rock bands,'” Rateliff says. “He's got a young punk in there.”


	Still, the topical tunes — with melodies that recalled vintage Guthrie or Prine and videos that spelled out the lyrics in each — kept coming. Some, like “Cancer,” are scathing (“as lucrative a business as a war,” he sings). Others are sarcastic, as when he quips, “Hell, even Kushner agrees, it's good real estate,” in “War Isn't Murder.” “You have to give folks credit,” he says. “We'd like to believe our peers maybe aren't as smart as us, but people are smart, and I never write down to anybody.”

	











	Posted just days after the assassination of United Healthcare head Brian Thompson, “United Health” mostly avoided commentary on the shooting but spelled out the ways that insurance companies riled up their own customers. Welles doesn't feel he responded quickly enough to the incident, but the video has garnered more than 2.2 million views since it was posted. “I feel like I have finally put my foot down and decided what I needed to sound like and not tried to do anything anybody else really wanted of me,” he says. “I thought I needed to be a rock & roll player, but I just don't have that coolness in me. To be able to just be myself, it just makes everything feel a lot better.”


	Anna Canoni, Woody Guthrie's granddaughter and the head of Woody Guthrie Publications, heard Welles last year, when “Cancer” popped up on a social reel. “It really got me to stop and take pause,” she says. “I listened to a few more songs and thought, ‘This is interesting.' What made Woody stand out in his time was that he was singing songs about the Dust Bowl and the Depression to the people it was affecting. He was relating their story back to them in song. Jesse is doing the same thing. You go, ‘Who is this kid? Where has he been?'”


	IN CONVERSATION, WELLES ISN'T QUITE THE FIREBRAND HEARD in his songs. Pausing before responding to questions, he sometimes cocks his head and glances to the side, pondering the appropriate response. But one question — about whether he voted in the last presidential election — doesn't elicit an answer at all. Staring at his Zoom camera, Welles scratches his head and remains silent for 20 seconds. Finally, he says, “I just … I didn't know I'd be talking about that kind of thing,” and declines to respond.


	On last year's “Trump Trailers,” Welles envisioned the current president as a trailer-park resident who would “run for supervisor” and “lose the vote, not give a damn/Run over the ballot with his dad's Trans Am.” From songs like that (or “Signal Leak,” which pokes at Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's group chats), one may assume Welles leans a certain, liberal-minded way. “We didn't talk politics much,” says Martin about his days with Welles in Dead Indian. “But he was always welcoming of people who were different: trans folks, people who weren't white. He was especially kind to homeless folks. I remember he'd always sit down and give them a cigarette and have a quick talk with them if they were hanging around. I always figured he was on the left side of the spectrum.”

	











	Welles is aware of the questions Oliver Anthony faced — or avoided — after “Rich Men North of Richmond,” the way the media tried to dissect where he stood on the issues. “I suppose that is part of the endeavor,” Welles acknowledges of what Anthony encountered. “People want to know, and you may not yourself know just exactly what's happened or what's going on. Maybe no answer is good enough. I can't imagine that's an easy position to be in.”


	In general, Welles projects that he's not beholden to anyone. To maintain his independence, he's now releasing his music on his own, with no record company backing. “That is true freedom,” he says. “You're not going to find protest music with the Columbia Records stamp on it. It's certainly not playing on the radio or anything like that.”


	That philosophy also seems to extend to his political views. Unlike protest singers of the past, Welles doesn't point fingers at specific people; names like Trump, Biden, or Kamala Harris never come up. On his voter registration form in Arkansas, Welles didn't declare a party affiliation. Instead, he speaks in generalities, opting to be the voice of those who don't trust anyone or anything in the so-called system. “I think a lot of us are politically homeless,” he says. “We've been orphaned, and it's likely that we have been since before I was born. It seems very apparent now, in a way that maybe it didn't in the past, that nobody has your interests in mind. And now it feels like the first step in any kind of progress is unearthing the truth of the matter first, and we are arriving at that truth every day.”


	How is that approach reflected in the current White House? Again, Welles doesn't mention specific names, although he hints at Elon Musk. “How do they not care about the little man, the citizen?” he says. “It seems like eons ago, but I do believe there was a very prominent billionaire who was a very critical component of the government, for what seems now like just a blip in time. That was maybe one of the first times it was visible. If there is one takeaway, the American people can know, after decades and decades of war and coverup, that at the end of the day, we are not who they have in mind.”


	Events of the last month, like immigration crackdowns and military call-ups, also elicit more philosophical musings than lashings out. “It seems like a great, concerted, and obvious distraction,” he says. “At all times, from all directions, throwing everything at the wall to see what will stick with the public. And nothing is sticking.” What are they distracting us from? “I don't know what exactly, because none of us know what the truth is. But to distract any individual from the truth is the game plan, and has been for decades. But especially now.”

	











	When he does get a bit more specific, his responses can be unexpected. In another online song, “PBS,” Welles sang about being a “kiddo down in Arkansas” who watched Mr. Rogers and “a purple dinosaur.” But he doesn't seem as rattled as others in the music world by the collapse of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the way that may result in local public-radio stations being unable to play music on the air without CPB funding. “They'll be fine,” he says, then adds, referring to himself, “It's not the duty of National Public Radio to spin some loser's record from Arkansas. They're there to inform. The music has moved over to streaming. I don't know who's really relying on radio. Some of the biggest artists right now don't even have any radio play.” 


	Whether it's careful or calculated, Welles' strategy is savvy, since he wants to be known as more than just the guy spewing songs inspired by cable news. On his three latest albums, including this week's Devil's Den, he's made a concerted effort to include only one social-commentary song per record. That slot on Devil's Den goes to “The Great Caucasian God,” about, he says, “the evangelical lockstep with war in the Middle East, and kind of a radical notion of bringing about the end times by killing people.” With its starkly beautiful arrangements and moments of Mellencamp-reminiscent rock dynamics, the more generalized songs on Pilgrim tap into both the disorientation and frustration so many of us are feeling right now: The Great Plains sweep of “Change Is in the Air” gives way to the Cobain Americana of “GTFOH” (for “get the fuck out of here”).


	Where Welles goes from here has even relative veterans like Rateliff intrigued. “Creating a space for yourself that feels authentic is something he's done really well, but now that he's arrived somewhere, I'm curious to see how he navigates all that, in a positive way,” says Rateliff. “The way people first discover you is how they see you. So even if daily political songs aren't what Jesse is, it's what people see him as now, and people create their own narrative. How do you continue to change and grow and present yourself if people have an expectation of you?”


	After a return engagement at Farm Aid in late September, Welles will embark on a series of multi-night residencies in Chicago, Denver, L.A., San Francisco, and New York, all of which are sold out. He's likely to draw crowds similar to the ones who flocked to his tour early this year and sang along with every word of “Fentanyl” and another fan favorite, “Walmart” (“I don't wanna go to Walmart today/Or tomorrow/Or the day after that/It's a mirage in a desert of bullshit they created”). “There are certain musicians who hit the right chords at the right time, when people feel a lack of empowerment,” says Canoni. “The beauty of Woody's work is that music can bring people together, and that's what I'm hoping for Jesse's work. But,” she adds with a laugh, “no pressure.”

	At Newport, a hint of Welles' past, present, and future was there for all who attended to see.  He was invited onstage to join some of the festival's boldface names, including Margo Price, Prine's son Tommy, and Lukas Nelson. Welles played both solo and with a backup band. With Nelson, Welles brought out an electric guitar and joined in on a version of the Beatles' “Revolution.” In a moment that somewhat echoed Dylan's gone-electric moment 60 years ago that weekend, Welles ended by trashing and stomping on his guitar. Rateliff, who was standing nearby when it happened, thought the move was of a piece with Welles' attempts to not be relegated to one musical bag: “He's trying to let people know he's more than just the guy with the guitar in the field. He's Bob Dylan going electric every night.”


	“It was just a whim,” Welles says now of the smashup. “At the moment, I thought that was the perfect thing to do. And still feels like the perfect thing to do.” Told that it felt more rock & roll than something one would see at Newport, he smiles and makes a possible Dylan reference. “I contain multiple dudes,” he says.

Gavin Adcock is on quite a tear. Earlier this week, he called out Charley Crockett for the Dollar a Day singer's post about authenticity in country music, and also said he felt that Zach Bryan “puts on a big mask in his day-to-day,” during an interview on Rolling Stone's Nashville Now podcast. In that same interview, Adcock doubled down on his previous comments that Beyoncé and her Grammy-winning album Cowboy Carter aren't country music.


	When asked what exactly does meet the country criteria for him, he said it was about a “lifestyle” and echoed statements similar to those Luke Bryan made last October. “It's buying into what's been going on in that genre,” Adcock said, “and just embracing the town.”

	Adcock also questioned Beyoncé's commitment to country fans. “I don't think Beyoncé cares about country fans. I think she has brought over pop fans to make whatever music she wants to make,” he said.

	But what country fans did Adcock mean? When asked if there are two types of fans of the genre, he paused and said, “I don't know…. Everybody has an opinion… I don't fault you for your opinion. I'm just going to voice mine.”


	Adcock told Nashville Now that fans who don't share his opinions are welcome at his concerts — but that they'd better expect a rowdy experience. “I sell t-shirts that say, ‘I Survived a Gavin Adcock Concert,” he boasted.

An unidentified flying object reportedly crashed and exploded in a cornfield in eastern Poland early on Wednesday, according to the country's news agency PAP.

Local police received reports around 2 a.m., finding burned metal and plastic debris near Osiny village. The explosion shattered windows in some homes, though no injuries were reported.

Despite the incident, Poland's Armed Forces Operational Command stated on social media that no violations of Polish airspace from neighbouring Ukraine or Belarus were recorded overnight.

Officials initially said the explosion may have been caused by a part of an old engine with a propeller.

Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz later said the object was most likely a drone, adding that an analysis was underway to determine whether it was a military or smuggling one, PAP reported.

Lublin District Prosecutor Grzegorz Trusiewicz told reporters several investigators — both civilian and military — were examining the crash site.

“We have a lot of manpower, we have the army to help us. I hope that we will be able to finish the operation by the evening,"" Trusiewicz said.

An unidentified flying object (UFO) crashed and exploded in a cornfield in eastern Poland early Wednesday.

Local authorities reported receiving calls about the crash around 2 a.m., discovering charred metal and plastic debris near the village of Osiny. The explosion from the UFO resulted in broken windows in nearby homes, but no injuries were reported, local news reported.

Poland's Armed Forces Operational Command announced on social media that overnight, there were no recorded violations of Polish airspace by neighboring Ukraine or Belarus. Initially, officials suggested the explosion could have been caused by an old engine part with a propeller. It comes just days after NASA spotted a ""hostile"" object heading toward Earth at 135,000mph - and predicted the exact date of its arrival.

Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz later indicated the object was likely a drone, adding that an investigation was underway to determine if it was military or smuggling-related.

Lublin District Prosecutor Grzegorz Trusiewicz informed reporters that several investigators, both civilian and military, were examining the crash site.



""We have a lot of manpower, we have the army to help us. I hope that we will be able to finish the operation by the evening,"" Trusiewicz said.

Since Russia initiated a full-scale invasion of Ukraine over three years ago, there have been multiple intrusions into Polish airspace, causing concern in the European Union and NATO member state and serving as a stark reminder of the proximity of the war.

In November, the Pentagon's UFO report unveiled hundreds of new sightings of unexplained aerial phenomena, but none suggested an extraterrestrial source.

The review included hundreds of cases where balloons, birds, and satellites were misidentified, as well as some that defy simple explanation, like a near-collision between a commercial airliner and an unknown object off the coast of New York.

While it's unlikely to end any debates about the existence of extraterrestrial life, the report does reflect increased public interest in the subject and the government's attempts to provide some answers.

The report was released a day after House lawmakers demanded more government transparency during a hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) - the government's term for UFOs.

Federal efforts to study and identify UAPs have been centered on potential threats to national security or air safety, not their science fiction aspects.

Officials at the Pentagon office established in 2022 to track UAPs, known as the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), have stated there's no evidence any of the cases they investigated have otherworldly origins.

It comes after Stephen Hawking predicted the exact date of the apocalypse - and NASA issued a terrifying warning.

His story, though hotly disputed, has become one of the most influential accounts in UFO history. Here are five of his most shocking claims.

Few figures in modern UFO lore have generated as much controversy as Bob Lazar. In 1989, he came forward in an interview with journalist George Knapp, claiming he worked at a secret facility near Area 51 known as S-4. According to Lazar, he was recruited to help reverse-engineer alien technology hidden by the United States government. His story, though hotly disputed, has become one of the most influential accounts in UFO history. Here are five of his most shocking claims.

Lazar alleged that the US government was concealing nine alien spacecraft in underground hangars carved into a mountain near Groom Lake. He described being escorted to S-4, where he witnessed flying saucers that appeared undamaged and fully intact. He insisted these were not experimental human aircraft but genuine extraterrestrial technology. 

Perhaps Lazar's most famous claim concerned the fuel source of these crafts: Element 115. At the time, this element was unknown to science. Lazar said the alien technology relied on a stable isotope of 115 that enabled powerful energy generation and anti-gravity effects. Years later, scientists synthesised a new element, now called Moscovium (element 115), though only in unstable forms lasting fractions of a second. The coincidence keeps Lazar's account alive in UFO circles, despite scepticism. 

Lazar explained that the propulsion system did not rely on rockets or jets, but on the ability to manipulate gravity itself. He described a 'gravity drive' that bent space-time around the craft, allowing instantaneous changes in direction and extraordinary speeds. Such technology, he argued, made traditional aerodynamics irrelevant and explained why UFOs could perform manoeuvres impossible for human aircraft. 

Central to Lazar's testimony was his allegation of a massive government cover-up. He claimed that scientists at S-4 were kept isolated from one another, limiting their knowledge of the overall project. After he went public, Lazar said he faced harassment, threats, and attempts to discredit him. Supporters argue that this alleged intimidation only reinforces his credibility, suggesting authorities wanted to silence him. 

Sceptics have consistently questioned Lazar's background. Records of his supposed degrees from MIT and Caltech cannot be verified, and officials deny his employment at Los Alamos National Laboratory, though a 1982 phone directory did list his name there. These contradictions fuel doubt about his story. Yet, despite the criticism, Lazar's testimony has shaped the modern UFO narrative. References to S-4, gravity propulsion, and Element 115 are now staples of conspiracy discussions. 

Bob Lazar remains a divisive figure. To believers, he is a whistleblower who risked everything to reveal humanity's contact with alien technology. To critics, he is a fabricator whose story collapses under scrutiny. Either way, his claims continue to resonate, raising questions about what secrets might lie hidden in the Nevada desert.

American filmmaker Michael Chaves didn't just direct The Conjuring: Last Rites—he lived through a haunting of his own while making it. The 40-year-old filmmaker, in a recent interview, recalled how the project turned him into a believer in the supernatural.

“When talking about making these movies, the question that always comes up is ‘Did anything spooky ever happen on set?' And my answer now is ‘Yes,'” Chaves said. “My experiences on (the sets of) The Conjuring: Last Rites have made me a believer. That is because of two things, the first having talked extensively with the Smurls and the conviction they had in telling their story. They're totally honest, reasonable, smart people, and this was something that was really a wound that they dealt with. It was a jarring, traumatic event. It resonated with me incredibly,"" he added.

But it's the second thing, that is sure to send some shivers down the spine.

“While shooting in England, I swear to God I was living in a haunted house. It was called The Old Vicarage—one of those places that doesn't even have an address, just a name. It was in this lovely neighborhood. And though I usually would go for a small place, I had my family with me, so we wound up at The Old Vicarage. It was called that because vicars, when they came to town and were working at the church, would reside there. The place was probably a couple hundred years old,” Michael recalled. 

The director went on to describe chilling moments in the house, from his daughter's iPad photo that seemed to capture a shadowy priest to hearing two men's voices upstairs when he was home alone. “Now, I'm scared, but I keep going. I search from one room to the next… and there is no one in that house—and the voices suddenly stop,” Chaves said. 

“At first, I'm relieved, I think, ‘Well, at least I'm not getting robbed,' because I'd have no clue how to deal with that. Then I realized that, I swear to God, those voices were there, and I was convinced it was a haunting. I know that something was there. I'm a total believer, and I apologize for any other interview where I might have been dismissive or just tossed off an answer. It happened to me,” he added.

His personal encounter sets the stage for The Conjuring: Last Rites, the final chapter of the blockbuster horror franchise inspired by real events. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson return as Ed and Lorraine Warren, facing a case that threatens not just their faith but their family itself. The film introduces Mia Tomlinson as Judy Warren and Ben Hardy as her boyfriend, pulling the next generation into the terrifying orbit of the Warrens' legacy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=paranormal","Does The Portal To Hell In Concordia Cemetery Really Exist??","https://kisselpaso.com/concordia-cemetery-el-paso/","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 17:02:03 GMT","

Concordia Cemetery isn't just old. It's ancient. Established in 1856 and home to over 60,000 buried souls, this historic landmark in Central El Paso has been the focus of ghost tours, graveyard investigations, and urban legends for decades. But one rumor stands above the rest: that somewhere on these haunted grounds lies a literal gateway to Hell.

And if you're willing to part with 25 bucks, you can go find it yourself.

El Paso's Paso Del Norte Paranormal Society offers regular ghost tours of the cemetery, and every October they crank it up a notch with special “Haunted History” tours. The centerpiece of this spooky trek? A site known as “Hell's Gate,” a mysterious area near the old railroad tracks where visitors claim to feel a strange pull. In more scientific terms, it's a “paranormal vortex.” Some say it messes with your internal compass. Others say it's just a weird breeze.

If that wasn't enough, some visitors have reported hearing ghostly hoofbeats and children laughing in the dark. Which, let's be honest, are probably the two most terrifying sounds you could hear in a graveyard. Tour guides have claimed they've seen shadows darting between headstones and mysterious mists rising from the infant section of the cemetery. Is it paranormal activity or just El Paso's dust playing tricks again?

Two brave ghost-hunters once claimed to catch a full-on “shadow person” near a crib-shaped grave marker. Another photo taken near gunslinger John Selman's grave shows what appears to be a pair of disembodied ghost legs just hanging out. Even Reddit has a few choice stories from local teens and amateur ghostbusters describing everything from phantom footsteps to sudden shifts in temperature. And no, not the kind you blame on West Texas weather.

Basically, if you've got a shaky camera and enough belief, Concordia is your horror movie set waiting to happen.

Because it's not a proper haunted site without a little Satanic panic, some locals believe that the cemetery has been used for ritual purposes. Reports of candles, strange symbols, and late-night offerings have added fuel to the fire. There's no evidence anything truly sinister has ever happened. Just your standard mix of myth, mischief, and dramatic lighting.

Absolutely. For your wallet. You might not fall into a pit of flames or get chased by demonic children, but you will hear spooky stories, walk across some uneven ground, and maybe take home a blurry photo that looks just eerie enough to haunt your group chat.

The real magic of Concordia's “Hell's Gate” isn't whether it's paranormal. It's the way it combines legit history with a heavy dose of theatrical ghost lore and a tourism model that works. If you've got 25 dollars and a healthy skepticism, or a very unhealthy curiosity, it's worth the trip.

Bring your camera, your sarcasm, and maybe an extra pair of pants. Just in case the ghost kids really do show up.

If an extraterrestrial intelligence were looking for signs of human communications, when and where should they look? In a new study, researchers at Penn State and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California analyzed when and where human deep space transmissions would be most detectable by an observer outside our solar system and suggest that the patterns they see could be used to guide our own search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).

""Humans are predominantly communicating with the spacecraft and probes we have sent to study other planets like Mars,"" said Pinchen Fan, graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at the Penn State Eberly College of Science, science principal investigator of the NASA grant supporting this research and first author of the paper.

""But a planet like Mars does not block the entire transmission, so a distant spacecraft or planet positioned along the path of these interplanetary communications could potentially detect the spillover; that would occur when Earth and another solar system planet align from their perspective. This suggests that we should look for alignment of planets outside of our solar system when searching for extraterrestrial communications.""

A paper describing the research appears in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, and the authors presented their findings at the 2025 Penn State SETI Symposium, hosted by the Penn State Extraterrestrial Intelligence Center.

""SETI researchers often search the universe for signs of past or present technology, called technosignatures, as evidence of intelligent life,"" Fan said.

""Considering the direction and frequency of our most common signals gives insights into where we should be looking to improve our chances of detecting alien technosignatures.""

The researchers analyzed logs from NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN), a system of ground-based facilities that permits two-way radio communications with human-made objects in space, acting as a relay to send commands to spacecraft and receive information they send back.

The research team carefully matched up DSN logs with information about spacecraft locations to determine the timing and directionality of radio communications from Earth. Although several countries have their own deep-space networks, the researchers said that the NASA-run DSN should be representative of the types of communications coming from Earth, in part because NASA has led most deep-space missions to date.

""NASA's Deep Space Network provides the crucial link between Earth and its interplanetary missions like the New Horizons spacecraft, which is now outbound from the solar system, and the James Webb Space Telescope,"" said Joseph Lazio, project scientist at JPL and an author of the paper.

""It sends some of humanity's strongest and most persistent radio signals into space, and the public logs of its transmissions allowed our team to establish the temporal and spatial patterns of those transmissions for the past 20 years.""

For this study, the researchers focused on transmissions to deep space, including transmissions to telescopes in space as well as interplanetary spacecraft, instead of transmissions intended for spacecraft or satellites in low-Earth orbit, which are relatively low power and would be difficult to detect from a distance.

The researchers found that deep space radio signals were predominantly directed toward spacecraft near Mars. Other common transmissions were directed toward other planets and to telescopes at sun-Earth Lagrange points—points in space where the gravity of the sun and Earth keep the telescopes in a relatively fixed position as viewed from Earth.

""Based on data from the last 20 years, we found that if an extraterrestrial intelligence were in a location that could observe the alignment of Earth and Mars, there's a 77% chance that they would be in the path of one of our transmissions—orders of magnitude more likely than being in a random position at a random time,"" Fan said.

""If they could view an alignment with another solar-system planet, there is a 12% chance they would be in the path of our transmissions. When not observing a planet alignment, however, these chances are minuscule.""

To improve our own search for technosignatures, the researchers said, humans should look for alignment of exoplanets—planets outside our solar system—or at least when exoplanets align with their host star.

Astronomers frequently study exoplanets during alignment with their host star. In fact, most of the currently known exoplanets were detected by looking for the darkening of a star when a planet crosses in front of, or transits, its host star from Earth's line of sight.

""However, because we are only starting to detect a lot of exoplanets in the last decade or two, we do not know many systems with two or more transiting exoplanets,"" Fan said.

""With the upcoming launch of NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, we expect to detect a hundred thousand previously undetected exoplanets, so our potential search area should increase greatly.""

Because our solar system is fairly flat with most planets orbiting on the same plane, the majority of DSN transmissions occurred within 5 degrees of Earth's orbital plane, the researchers explained. If the solar system were a dinner plate with all the planets and objects sitting on that plate, human transmissions tended to follow along the plate's surface, rather than shooting out into space at a stark angle.

The research team also calculated that an average DSN transmission could be detected about 23 light-years away using telescopes like ours. Focusing efforts, they said, on solar systems that are within 23 light-years and especially whose plane is oriented with its edge toward Earth could improve our search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The team now plans to identify these systems and quantify how frequently they could have received signals coming from Earth.

The DSN transmission patterns found could also be applied to searches for laser transmissions from exoplanets, the researchers said, though they noted that lasers would have much less spillover than radio transmission.

NASA is testing its interplanetary laser communication system, and extraterrestrial civilizations may opt to use lasers instead of radio waves.

""Humans are pretty early in our spacefaring journey, and as we reach further into our solar system, our transmissions to other planets will only increase,"" said Jason Wright, professor of astronomy and astrophysics in the Penn State Eberly College of Science, director of the Penn State Extraterrestrial Intelligence Center, and an author of the paper.

""Using our own deep space communications as a baseline, we quantified how future searchers for extraterrestrial intelligence could be improved by focusing on systems with particular orientations and planet alignments.""

Computations for this research were performed on the Penn State Institute for Computational and Data Sciences Roar supercomputer.

A new study on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) has proposed the best places to search for a signal from alien intelligences, suggesting it could significantly improve our chances of making such a detection.

As well as searching for potentially habitable exoplanets, and searching the skies for signs of alien megastructures, scientists looking for alien life have focused on searching for electromagnetic transmissions. These could be intermittent but intentionally directed signals (aliens saying ""howdy"") or simply leakage of persistent signals.

We are a little short on data on alien civilizations, given that we have found a grand total of zero in our century of searching. As such, researchers have attempted to look at our own signatures of intelligence and how they propagate across the cosmos. 

""Previous studies have proposed various kinds of radio technosignatures emitted by humankind, assessed their detectability, and have often described the search for these technosignatures as searching for 'Earth-level civilizations',"" the team explains in their new paper, adding that studies have found that the most detectable of our signals come from intermittent, celestially targeted radio transmissions, and persistent, celestially targeted radio transmissions.

""Intermittent, celestially targeted radio transmissions include intentional transmissions such as the Arecibo message (NAIC Staff 1975) or planetary radar. However, these transmissions are highly sporadic in timing and directionality. By contrast, persistent, celestially targeted radio transmissions include much more frequent transmissions between ground stations and deep-space spacecraft, such as those from the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).""

It is NASA's Deep Space Network that is the focus of the new study. This is a network of antennas used to communicate with spacecraft, including the furthest spacecraft from Earth, currently over 25 million kilometers (15.5 million miles) away. According to the team, if aliens use similar methods to communicate with their own probes in their solar systems, this could significantly improve our chances of detecting a stray alien signal, because it gives us some precise places to look.

“Humans are predominantly communicating with the spacecraft and probes we have sent to study other planets like Mars,” Pinchen Fan, graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at the Penn State Eberly College of Science, and first author of the paper, explained in a statement.

“But a planet like Mars does not block the entire transmission, so a distant spacecraft or planet positioned along the path of these interplanetary communications could potentially detect the spillover; that would occur when Earth and another solar system planet align from their perspective. This suggests that we should look for alignment of planets outside of our solar system when searching for extraterrestrial communications.”

The idea is similar to another proposal, which suggests that during supernova events, aliens may choose to direct their own signal at the star, knowing that others may want to take a closer look. Then anyone looking at the supernova from behind it could pick up the signal. But in this case, we might not have to wait for a supernova event, and should instead try and observe exoplanets around other stars when they are nicely aligned with Earth's telescopes.

  

The team analyzed data from NASA's DSN communications over the past two decades, as well as the position in the Solar System of the spacecraft they were communicating with. 

“NASA's Deep Space Network provides the crucial link between Earth and its interplanetary missions like the New Horizons spacecraft, which is now outbound from the Solar System, and the James Webb Space Telescope,” Joseph Lazio, project scientist at JPL and an author of the paper, added. “It sends some of humanity's strongest and most persistent radio signals into space, and the public logs of its transmissions allowed our team to establish the temporal and spatial patterns of those transmissions for the past 20 years.”

Focusing on the most powerful communications – rather than low-power communication with satellites orbiting the Earth – the team found that the signals were predominantly directed at Mars, with some going to further out spacecraft, for example, placed at the Sun-Earth Lagrange points convenient for parking our space telescopes.

”Based on data from the last 20 years, we found that if an extraterrestrial intelligence were in a location that could observe the alignment of Earth and Mars, there's a 77% chance that they would be in the path of one of our transmissions — orders of magnitude more likely than being in a random position at a random time,"" Fan explained. 

“If they could view an alignment with another solar system planet, there is a 12% chance they would be in the path of our transmissions. When not observing a planet alignment, however, these chances are minuscule.”

In this instance, the universe (or gravitational interactions) does appear to be giving us a little help. With a few oddball exceptions, planets in mature systems tend to orbit within a fairly narrow plane around their host stars, making alignment much more probable than if they were to orbit in random orientations. The team suggests that by looking for planetary alignments around other stars, we could significantly increase our chances of detecting stray alien signals. 

 

According to the team's work, the signals from the DSN could be detected from about 23 light-years away using telescopes similar to ours. The team is now planning to identify exoplanet systems that are ""edge on"" to our own Solar System's plane, and figure out how frequently they could have received signals as we communicate with our spacecraft. 

“Because we are only starting to detect a lot of exoplanets in the last decade or two, we do not know many systems with two or more transiting exoplanets,” Fan added. “With the upcoming launch of NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, we expect to detect a hundred thousand previously undetected exoplanets, so our potential search area should increase greatly.”

If any aliens have had this same idea, there's a (still very slim) chance that they could have detected us already. However, there is another problem with the idea, which could make the detection of aliens unlikely. NASA and others are already experimenting with potential laser transmissions. If aliens do the same and are successful, these are much less prone to ""spilling"" their signal out for all behind the target to see. It could be that communication using radio waves is only very brief on astronomical timescales, if aliens use it to communicate with their own spacecraft at all.

But, with no obvious signs of life out there in a vast galaxy, this could certainly be a way of narrowing down where to look.

The study is published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

Elizabeth Klarer wtih a bust of her intergalactic lover, Akon.

As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas - the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth - it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved.

An American couple, Betty and Barney Hill, went to their deathbeds convinced they were abducted and probed by aliens and had their memories of the 1961 encounter erased.

Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959.

These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas - bigger than Mount Everest - hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as ""not natural"".

This image from NASA shows the fast-moving interstellar object that has got many to wonder about alien encounters that have been reported over the years.

The object is moving at a speed of 209 000 kph, and has no tail, a telltale sign astronomers say distinguishes it from a comet.

It was first picked up by a telescope in Chile and then photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope a few weeks ago.

This visitor is bigger, faster and behaves differently from the two previous visitors to our galaxy -  Oumuamua and Borisov - and is shielded behind the sun as it hurtles in our general direction.

Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University thinks the visitor is unlikely to be a natural object and believes governments around the world should formulate a treaty so they know how to handle a possible hostile alien invasion.

Klarer had no such negative thoughts. For her, it was all about peace, love and understanding - things she tried to convey from her lover from the planet Meton in the Alpha Centauri System, according to earlier reports by ""Independent Media"".

Klarer, who was a meteorologist, claimed to have had the most intimate encounter with extraterrestrials, writing in her book ""Beyond the Light Barrier"", published in 1980, that she bore a son with her alien lover, Akon.

Klarer claimed her sightings at what became known as Flying Saucer Hill were witnessed by a Zulu manager, Ladam, as well as her sister, May, on the family farm in Rosetta.

Various articles in the ""Sunday Tribune"" over the years reported that on April 7, 1956, she visited the hilltop again after further reports from her family that Zulu workers had seen the ""lightning bird"" appear there again. 

This time, Akon took her aboard his scout ship, a craft some 18 m in diameter, before transporting her to the cigar-shaped mother ship.

During the encounter, kisses were exchanged, and he told Klarer that she was a reincarnated Venusian and a long-lost soulmate. 

He further explained that they occasionally took women from Earth as partners, as the offspring strengthened their race. He also claimed that several Venusians were living among us. She was returned to the hilltop thereafter.

In 1959, Klarer claimed she visited Meton with Akon, orbiting Proxima Centauri, where she gave birth to their son, Ayling, before returning to Earth because the planet's vibrations played havoc with her heart.

Klarer's main thrust throughout her life, and in the pages of her book, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilisation.

Klarer often commemorated the April 7 anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill, sometimes aided by others as she grew frail.

Her interstellar love story inspired a stage production, and Jimmy Neversink even penned a tune on the unexplained affair across the Universe.

When this reporter covered Klarer's funeral in Pietermaritzburg in February 1994, her sisters expressed profound loss, but were also at peace now that her battle against scepticism had come to an end. 

One, however, twirled her index finger about her head, indicating that her youngest sibling may have had a mental health issue.

Betty and Barney Hill claimed they were abducted by aliens in 1961 while returning home from a visit to Niagara Falls.

In the case of the Hills, hypnosis was used to try to make sense of what had happened to the New Hampshire couple on September 19, 1961. 

They were on their way home from a trip to Niagara Falls when they saw a string of bright lights in the sky. The couple claimed that they were rendered unconscious by a group of humanoids who approached them when Barney got out of the family car, armed with his pistol, soon after a craft, measuring 12 meters across, blocked their path.

What they did recall was waking up not far from the car. Betty's smart court shoes had been badly scuffed on the toes, as though she had been dragged there. Both their watches had stopped and never ticked again.

After the troubling incident, Betty drew a star map which closely resembles actual star placements which were only discovered by astronomers a decade later, indicating that their alleged abductors had come from Zeta Reticuli.

Media coverage turned the Hills into celebrities, spawning a 1975 made-for-television film starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons.

Betty's subsequent dreams showed a strong correlation with details Barney shared under hypnosis.

However, in both cases, there was never enough evidence to conclusively prove their abduction story, nor to disprove it as a mere fiction.

Klarer's main thrust throughout her life, and in the pages of her book, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilisation.

Klarer often commemorated the April 7 anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill, sometimes aided by others as she grew frail.

Her interstellar love story inspired a stage production, and Jimmy Neversink even penned a tune on the unexplained affair across the Universe.

When this reporter covered Klarer's funeral in Pietermaritzburg in February 1994, her sisters expressed profound loss, but were also at peace now that her battle against scepticism had come to an end. 

One, however, twirled her index finger about her head, indicating that her youngest sibling may have had a mental health issue.

Betty and Barney Hill claimed they were abducted by aliens in 1961 while returning home from a visit to Niagara Falls.

In the case of the Hills, hypnosis was used to try to make sense of what had happened to the New Hampshire couple on September 19, 1961. 

They were on their way home from a trip to Niagara Falls when they saw a string of bright lights in the sky. The couple claimed that they were rendered unconscious by a group of humanoids who approached them when Barney got out of the family car, armed with his pistol, soon after a craft, measuring 12 meters across, blocked their path.

What they did recall was waking up not far from the car. Betty's smart court shoes had been badly scuffed on the toes, as though she had been dragged there. Both their watches had stopped and never ticked again.

After the troubling incident, Betty drew a star map which closely resembles actual star placements which were only discovered by astronomers a decade later, indicating that their alleged abductors had come from Zeta Reticuli.

Media coverage turned the Hills into celebrities, spawning a 1975 made-for-television film starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons.

Betty's subsequent dreams showed a strong correlation with details Barney shared under hypnosis.

However, in both cases, there was never enough evidence to conclusively prove their abduction story, nor to disprove it as a mere fiction.

ISRAEL AT WAR - DAY 685

JTA — A speechwriter who joined the US Department of Homeland Security in March has in the past promoted the “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory that is widely considered antisemitic and compared conservatives in the United States to Jews in Nazi Germany.

The baseless theory alleges that a shadowy cabal is working to replace white people with non-white immigrants; in the original version of the theory, which is frequently repeated, the cabal is Jewish. The theory has inspired multiple extremist attacks, including the 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and a shooting at a Buffalo, New York, grocery store in 2022.

Several months after the Buffalo shooting, which killed 10, Eric Lendrum endorsed the theory on his podcast “The Right Take” — not for the first time. He said it was “real” and “already being put into effect in some European cities.”

In a previous episode, titled “Is White Replacement a Myth?,” he accused Democrats of “systematically replacing Americans” to gain political power.

On that episode, which aired in April 2021, he argued that the theory was not antisemitic, saying, “Literally no one blames this on Jews.”

Lendrum's past comments — made on podcasts, in columns and on social media — were first reported this week by Notus, an independent news outlet covering the government. The site noted that while Lendrum's digital output was vast, his audience appeared to be relatively small.

His X account, to which he has limited visibility to his 450 followers after Notus' report, follows 88 accounts — a number that is widely understood to be a white supremacist code representing “Heil Hitler.” Other figures accused of antisemitism in the past have followed just 88 accounts despite using the platform frequently.

The Notus report adds Lendrum to a growing list of Trump administration hires, drawn from a vast far-right media ecosystem, who have promoted antisemitic rhetoric and ideas. It comes at a time when his department has posted social media content that appears to contain antisemitic dogwhistles.

The department's website suggests that speechwriters are not responsible for social media posts. The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Lendrum's past comments.

Before being hired at DHS in March, according to his LinkedIn profile, Lendrum wrote for the right-wing site American Greatness and worked as an associate producer for the radio show hosted by Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump advisor who was accused of having sworn allegiance to a Hungarian Nazi group.

“American conservatives are, right now, on a course for being every bit as ostracized and alienated from broader society as Jews were in the years leading up to Nazi Germany,” Lendrum, who graduated from college in 2017, wrote in one American Greatness column in 2021.

According to the DHS Office of Public Affairs' website, Lendrum's duties as a speechwriter include preparing “speeches, talking points, editorials, Congressional testimony, video scripts, web content and other written content for the Secretary and Deputy Secretary.”

Other Trump administration hires with records of promoting extremist ideas include Kingsley Wilson, who was appointed as the Pentagon press secretary in May, has repeatedly echoed antisemitic rhetoric online, sparking criticism from the House Jewish Caucus.

The appointment of Darren Beattie as the acting under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs in February also drew criticism for his track record of consorting with white supremacists and hawking conspiracy theories.

And the appointment of Paul Ingrassia in May to a senior legal role raised eyebrows because of his past defense of the avowed white supremacist Nick Fuentes and work with antisemitic influencer Andrew Tate.

Most recently, President Donald Trump tapped E.J. Antoni, who has said the Nazi warship Bismarck is “hard not to love,” to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Psychologists have long considered how a tendency towards irrational thinking or particular  personality traits might predict peoples' interest in conspiracies. Yet these individual factors do not explain the group processes through which conspiracy theorists are extending their influence and impact. 

Over five years, we sought out and got to know people on the cusp of becoming conspiracy theorists. And the results of our new study show that a sense of community activism is attracting people to these ideas. 

Indeed, contrary to the stereotype of isolated keyboard warriors who have gone down the rabbit hole, conspiracy theorists are becoming organised, recruiting supporters, picketing vaccination centres and vandalising telecommunication and traffic infrastructures.

Our research examined the growing interest in conspiracy theories and how associated activism emerges. Immersive research with conspiracy theorists is rare. But revealing our status as researchers actually allowed us to build relationships with people, who shared insights into what motivates their involvement.

In particular, we spoke to people about conspiracy theories concerning 5G technology, COVID-19, 15-minute cities and low-traffic neighbourhoods. We also took part in online discussions and travelled the UK to sit in on public meetings and conferences. Ultimately, our insights revealed how people tend to follow a pathway from initial interest, to community engagement and potentially activism.

Belief in conspiracy theories is often initiated by traumatic life events. Job losses or the death of a loved one can trigger anger and suspicion towards public services, authority figures, and experts. This is especially so if people feel that the tragic or destructive events that affected them could have been averted. And these emotions can motivate a search for answers.

When conspiracy theories claim to explain painful personal circumstances or wider fears over COVID-19, or climate change, people can experience “awakenings”. These are moments of insight during which people come to believe that the causes of their problems lie with secretive groups which control society. 

One person we spoke to described conspiracy theories as enabling him to “access the way the world really works… as if a light was switched on in my head and I could see things clearly”. 

People rarely experience their awakening in isolation. In online group chats, people discover others with similar problems. In public meetings, beliefs in various theories are boosted by interactions where people discuss their suspicions over who is to blame for particular issues. In the process, these groups feed off their common emotions, building an atmosphere of energy and excitement.

The loss of traditional meeting places such as pubs and high streets, along with high levels of loneliness, may be driving people to look for new forms of connection and meaning.

The people we spoke to expressed surprise at the social connections they had found through these communities. As one participant put it, “there's a lot of support out there for people who are doing their own research… there is always someone wanting to hear more, building on the work of others, giving each other support. There's a real buzz in this community.” 

Conspiracy theories don't merely offer alternative explanations for events, they are resources for communities that provide identity, purpose and belonging. These benefits may explain why it is so difficult to talk people out of their beliefs in conspiracy theories.

Indeed, when conspiracy communities generate common interpretations and shared emotions, conspiracy theories can resonate powerfully, making them seem more real than they are. 

This effect is compounded by the way which conspiracy theories invite believers to build on ideas by “doing their own research”. The internet serves as a vast database where conspiracy theorists can discover articles, documents and scientific reports to support their claims.

And despite the questionable quality of many such sources, contributing to conspiracy theories can provide a boost to people's self esteem, making them feel like experts and heroic detectives. A key aspect of these communities is how they empower members to contribute.

Yet, beyond generating more theories, conspiracy communities are becoming organised networks for protest and activism. Given that conspiracy theories raise suspicion and anger over peoples' problems, and point the blame at particular targets, we found that believers can feel compelled to take part in protests.

For example, some claim that the urban planning concept of 15-minute cities is part of secretive government scheme to limit citizens' movement. Protesters against these and other efforts to improve urban environments are uniting under slogans such as “stop the tyranny”.

Activism based on conspiracy theories can come with serious risks. Many of those involved lose contact with family and friends. Increasingly, conspiracy activists are being charged with crimes. In 2024, an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist was sentenced to prison for five years for encouraging violence against chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty.

Moreover, when conspiracy theorists take action without tested evidence, they may misidentify targets. This can result in harm to innocent people and can undermine the very institutions needed to solve crimes.

To be sure, instances of conspiracy and foul play by powerful figures and organisations do happen. You have to wonder how much energy then, is wasted fighting imaginary enemies while actual wrongdoing is overlooked.

Perhaps the real winners here are the conspiracy entrepreneurs – people who capitalise on conspiracy theories by creating content that heightens peoples' suspicions about problematic events. In the process, these people build attention and fame, while peddling products and services from books, merchandise and coaching, to vitamin pills and gadgets.

In this article

While Google made a big splash with its Pixel 10 series of smartphones, it was the software features that were strategically important for the tech giant's bid to compete with players like OpenAI and Perplexity in consumer AI.

As it introduced its latest devices on Wednesday, Alphabet-owned Google showed off a slew of artificial intelligence features that are powered by the firm's Gemini AI models. ""Magic Cue,"" for example, can scour various apps for information and deliver it to users when required. ""Camera Coach"" can give users tips on how to adjust framing and other aspects of a picture for the perfect shot. Live translation for phone calls is also available.

All of this gives a glimpse into the so-called ""agentic AI"" future that tech giants are hoping to reach, where super-smart AI assistants can carry out complex tasks.

It is a pivotal time for Google to come up with answers, as fears mount that users and revenue from its core search product could be eroded as more people turn to rivals like Perplexity and OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Before Google lies a unique opportunity — the company develops Android, the operating system that is installed across more than three billion devices globally, many of which are smartphones.

""The company is leapfrogging rivals like OpenAI and DeepSeek by leveraging its access to billions of Android users, enabling a more effective distribution, integration, and a wider range of use cases for Gemini at scale,"" Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.

Ben Wood,  chief analyst at CCS Insight, said the smartphone is the ""most pervasive consumer device on the planet"" and that Google now has an ""opportunity to get people hooked on Gemini.""

Google doesn't need to sell a high volume of Pixel phones to find AI success with consumers. In fact, Pixel had just a 0.3% share of the global smartphone market in the first half of the year, compared to 23% for Samsung and 11.8% for Apple, according to the International Data Corporation.

But Google's aim with its smartphones is to show off the best that Android has to offer in terms of software and AI. At that point, Android licensers, which include the likes of Samsung and Xiaomi, may adopt some of those features on their new handsets.

This cycle would in turn spread Google's Gemini and AI tools to more users.

""This massive user base creates a ""flywheel effect"" of adoption, usage, and feedback, further solidifying Gemini's position as a master agent on the most widely used device on the planet—the smartphone,"" Shah said.

The timing is also advantageous because of struggles at rival Apple. The Cupertino giant's lack of AI strategy has concerned investors, with the iPhone showing very few features compared to Google's offerings.

""Google has their tails up because Apple has dropped the ball. When Apple gets AI right it will be a fantastic experience. But right now, Google and all Android licensees have a window of opportunity,"" Wood said.

Yet while there is now a land grab for users between major AI players, questions still linger over how Google will eventually monetize its AI services.

Negotiators from 185 nations worked beyond last Thursday's deadline and through the night in an ultimately futile search for common ground.

Health experts warn that this issue could be partially associated with the growing use of “noise-canceling” headphones.
  APD occurs when the brain cannot properly interpret auditory information, despite one's hearing ability being fully functional. This can lead to difficulties in understanding speech, particularly in noisy environments or when someone speaks quickly. People with this condition often need things repeated or take longer to respond in conversations.
  While these noise-canceling devices offer clear benefits in blocking external sounds, overuse may affect the

The cultivation of lavender in this region took root in Roman times. People back then valued the plant for its healing properties, its soothing qualities in baths, and its fragrant use in perfumes.
  It wasn't until the 19th century that lavender farming took off. In nearby Grasse — the perfume capital of the world — the perfume industry began to flourish. __1__ This boom led to the expansion of lavender cultivation across Provence, particularly in the Valensole Plateau.

Live Updates


• Texas map advances: After a standoff that lasted over two weeks, Texas is poised to pass a GOP-drawn congressional map this evening. The redistricting plan — backed by President Donald Trump — would create five more GOP-leaning House districts in time for next year's midterm elections. The bill has passed a state Senate committee and is headed for a final vote in the upper chamber.
    


• California redistricting push: At the same time, California Democrats are working through a series of votes on a plan that would allow them to temporarily redraw the state's congressional maps — if voters approve. The proposal would likely net the party five seats, dealing an electoral counterpunch.
    


• Trump to join patrol in DC: Meanwhile, Trump said he plans to join law enforcement in the nation's capital this evening, after he federalized the city's police force and deployed the National Guard, citing a public safety emergency. Read our fact check of his claims on DC crime.
    


            The California Assembly and Senate have each separately passed their first of three redistricting bills that will ask voters to swap the state's current congressional maps for new ones aimed at netting Democrats an additional five seats in the US House.
    


            The California Assembly has voted 57-20 to approve a proposed constitutional amendment that would allow the redrawing.
    


            Separately, the California Senate has passed a bill on a 30-9 party-line vote describing the new congressional maps Democrats hope voters will approve in a November 4 special election.
    


What's next: It's a swap. The Senate bill must pass in the Assembly, and the Assembly bill must pass in the Senate. 



            And the Democratic proposal is a three-bill package, so another piece of legislation — one calling for and funding the November 4 special election — must also pass through the chambers. All three bills need a two-thirds majority in both chambers to pass.
    


            If the proposed constitutional amendment, Proposition 50, is approved by voters, the new maps would be in place in California during the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.
    


Why this matters: Democrats have framed their redistricting push as a countermeasure to moves by GOP-led states like Texas, which is in the process of passing new maps that could net Republicans up to five additional seats.
    


            The plan from Democrats initially included a trigger to only take effect if another state engaged in mid-decade redistricting. That provision was removed today, one day after the Texas state House passed GOP-drawn new congressional maps, with a spokesperson for the speaker of the state Assembly saying the Texas vote had rendered the trigger language unnecessary.
    


This post has been updated with information about the state Senate vote.



            President Donald Trump appeared to offer a rationale for Ukraine to go on offense against Russia today — notable rhetoric as the momentum around peace talks has stalled.
    


                    “It is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invader's country. It's like a great team in sports that has a fantastic defense, but is not allowed to play offense. There is no chance of winning! It is like that with Ukraine and Russia,” Trump said in a Truth Social post.
                





            He criticized the Biden administration, which had a long-standing policy that Ukraine could not launch long-range American-made missiles into Russia. That changed in November 2024, following pressure from US allies.
    


Efforts for peace talks: Trump's comments come as the Kremlin has openly contradicted the White House on plans for a bilateral meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, suggesting that leader-level talks are far from imminent and that Putin has yet to agree to such a meeting.
    


What Zelensky is saying: Zelensky said Russia's massive overnight attacks on Ukraine demonstrate Moscow is “trying to wriggle out of the need to hold a meeting.” In his nightly video address today, the Ukrainian president said the Russians “do not want to end this war. They are continuing their massive attacks against Ukraine and very fierce assaults on the front lines.”
    


Other diplomacy: Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney talked today about “how to build on the president's leadership to support long-term peace and security for Ukraine and Europe,” according to a statement from the prime minister's office.
    


            Vice President JD Vance declined to say where law enforcement officials are sending homeless people in Washington, DC, after their encampments are cleared.
    


            Pressed on the matter during a visit to Georgia, Vance said “The question betrays a certain misunderstanding of what we're trying to do and what is the nature of real compassion.”
    


            He then recounted a story about his family being yelled during a trip to DC years ago, arguing that the administration is focused on keeping those with mental health issues off the streets.
    


                    “Why have we convinced ourselves that it's compassionate to allow a person who's obviously a schizophrenic, or suffering from some other mental illness, why is it compassionate to let that person fester in the streets?” Vance said.
                





            He later alluded to ensuring people have access to mental treatment, but did not offer any details.
    


            Vance, who was in Georgia to tout Republicans' domestic policy law, also demurred when asked if the White House plans to deploy troops to other cities, but did not rule it out.
    


            “We have focused on Washington, DC, because it's a federal city under our jurisdiction but we certainly hope that, whether it's Atlanta or anywhere else, people are going to look around and say, ‘We don't have to live like this,'” he said. “We hope that people see what we're doing in Washington, DC, and follow our example all across the country.”
    


Remember: President Donald Trump federalized the city's police force and deployed the National Guard in the nation's capital earlier this month, citing a public safety emergency.
    


            The president has repeatedly complained about rising crime in DC, but overall crime numbers are lower this year than in 2024. Here's our fact check.



            Democrats and Republicans are engaged in a battles over redistricting in California and Texas as they seek to influence  the upcoming midterm elections. which will determine the balance of power in the House of Representatives.
    


            Before we get into those details, the news in Washington, DC, is that President Donald Trump said in an interview that he plans to join law enforcement on the streets of the capital tonight. A senior White House official said the details are still being worked out, but this comes after Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth staged a lunch to thank the National Guard members deployed to DC at the Shake Shack inside Union Station.
    


OK, now for the details on redistricting:



Texas: A state Senate committee has advanced the GOP-drawn congressional map passed by the state House. Now it's ready for a vote in the full Texas Senate. The upper chamber will reconvene at 7 p.m. local time (8 p.m. ET), but it's unclear how quickly they will take up the bill, as other items are also on the calendar. State Democrats plan to challenge the GOP-drawn House map, Texas State Rep. Gina Hinojosa told CNN.
    


California: Democrats are taking up their proposed constitutional amendment to temporarily redraw their congressional maps. State Republicans filed a lawsuit to stop the Democratic redistricting effort, but California's Supreme Court yesterday rejected the challenge. The GOP lawmakers had attempted to stop the proposed amendment from making it onto the ballot on the grounds that the legislature didn't give voters enough notice.

            Former GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said he will be raising funds to defeat California Democrats' redistricting proposal introduced in response to the GOP effort in Texas to redraw congressional lines ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
    


            Saying there's a “unique group” forming to oppose California redistricting, McCarthy touted the efforts of Charles Munger, son of a late billionaire financier, and former GOP Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who have mobilized for the fight. And he said he would be involved with his own committee.
    


            McCarthy was repeatedly pressed on the push by Texas Republicans to redraw congressional lines, potentially netting Republicans five US House seats in the state next year's 2026 midterms, and he defended the push — though he expressed unease with the potential of cascading retaliation.
    


                    “This is something that could be very dangerous nationwide if the Democrats move forward, because Republicans could do this in more states than the Democrats,” McCarthy told CNN's Dana Bash on “Inside Politics.” The former speaker repeatedly said that Texas “has a right to do what they're going to do,” referencing the 10th Amendment.
                





            The former GOP House speaker and onetime California Assembly member also referenced his own support for a citizens redistricting commission in the state legislature. And he cautioned Republicans against drawing too many conclusions from the results of previous elections.
    


                    “Look, I think any times people play with this, things move — you try to draw a line because you think, (in) the last election, President Trump did exceptionally well. That doesn't mean the Republicans did well — President Trump did well, those were President Trump voters. I think that stuff always blows back on you,” McCarthy said.
                





            President Donald Trump said in an interview that he plans to join law enforcement on the streets of Washington, DC, this evening.
    


                    “I'm going to be going out tonight, I think, with the police, and with the military, of course,” the president told radio host Todd Starnes today.
                





            A senior White House official said the details of the evening are still being worked out.
    


            Trump's plan comes a day after Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth staged a lunch to thank the National Guard members deployed to DC at the Shake Shack inside Union Station.
    


            Many of the National Guard members at the lunch said they had come from South Carolina — one of six red states that have announced they have or will send guard members to DC. Others include West Virginia, Ohio, Mississippi, Louisiana and Tennessee.
    


Remember: Trump federalized the city's police force and deployed the National Guard in the nation's capital earlier this month, citing a public safety emergency.

CNN's Alejandra Jaramillo contributed to this post. 



            President Donald Trump and New York Attorney General Letitia James are both claiming victory after a mixed ruling from an appeals court in the civil fraud case against the president.
    


            The court threw out the roughly half-billion dollar judgment against Trump, but the ruling was not unanimous, which leaves the president still liable for fraud. The judges aligned to uphold his liability and toss the penalty so the case could move forward for further appellate review.
    


            In a lengthy post on Truth Social, Trump called the decision a “total victory.”
    


            “I greatly respect the fact that the Court had the Courage to throw out this unlawful and disgraceful Decision that was hurting Business all throughout New York State. Others were afraid to do business there,” he said.
    


            Trump also took aim at James, as well as the administration of former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, baselessly claiming in part that the cases against him were “an attack” from his political opponents.
    


            Meantime, James also praised the ruling, saying in a statement that the court “affirmed the well-supported finding of the trial court: Donald Trump, his company, and two of his children were liable for fraud.”
    


            She said her office would continue to appeal, but pointed out the court upheld the injunctive relief that limits Trump's ability to do business in New York.
    


Read about the case in greater detail here.



            A Texas Senate committee has advanced the GOP-drawn congressional map passed by the state House, sending the measure to the full Texas Senate.
    


            The bill was approved in the Special Committee on Congressional Redistricting with five senators voting in favor, three opposed and one absent.
    


            The state's upper chamber will reconvene at 7 p.m. local time (8 p.m. ET), but it's unclear how quickly they will take up the bill, as other items are also on the calendar.
    


How we got here: The Texas Senate passed a congressional map in the first legislative session, but it is now taking up the map passed by the House, which was slightly different.
    


            The redistricting plan — backed by President Donald Trump — would create five more GOP-leaning House districts in time for next year's midterm elections.
    


Speaking in favor: “I'm very concerned that if the Republicans lost the majority in the US House, that … the two years following the midterms could be very harmful to Texas and to the United States,” said GOP state Sen. Phil King, the chair of the committee. “I want us to maintain a Republican majority and hopefully increase the Republican majority in the US Congress and that's my purpose for being willing to carry this map.”
    


The opposition: State Sen. Carol Alvarado, a Democrat, said the Trump administration's “issues and policies and bills should stand on their own and let the American people make those decisions — and not this rigged districting.”
    


            While redistricting hearings were conducted during the first special session, several Democratic state senators also raised concerns about the lack of hearings on the new map in the second special session.
    


            Democrats will challenge Republican redistricting efforts after the Texas House passed GOP-drawn congressional maps, Texas State Rep. Gina Hinojosa told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.
    


                    “We go straight to federal court. This is a direct attack on not just the Voting Rights Act, but it is a direct attack on the constitutional rights of people of color in Texas,” Hinojosa said in an interview today.
                





            The lawmaker said the map that passed the state House is not only trying to “gain five new Republican seats for Donald Trump in the US Congress through Texas, but it is doing it on the backs of the Latino community and the African American community by targeting for elimination congressional districts that are majority-minority.”
    


            Hinojosa also said that while there are efforts from some blue states to offset the gerrymandering attempt in Texas, it may not be enough to undo the harm to Texans' constitutional rights, particularly for minorities.
    


                    The Democrat said she's glad California is “taking actions to protect against and nullify what Texas is doing,” but for Texans, if the redistricting bill is not overturned by federal courts, “nothing that the other states do will take away from that harm” that the state's legislation will cause.
                





This post has been updated with additional comments from Hinojosa.



            The Texas state Senate's Special Committee on Congressional Redistricting is holding a hearing right now on the state's new congressional maps.
    


            The Trump-backed redistricting plan, which would create five more GOP-leaning House districts, must be approved by the state's upper chamber before heading to Gov. Greg Abbott's desk for signature. The full state Senate is expected to reconvene around 8 p.m. ET.
    


            We're following the meetings today in the state legislature and will bring you more updates as they become available.
    


            Vice President JD Vance will travel to Georgia today to tout the Trump administration's signature tax-and-spending law — and to give an early boost to GOP efforts to flip a key Senate seat in the state.
    


            Vance is expected to highlight the law's major tax provisions during the event at an industrial refrigeration manufacturing facility in Peachtree City, arguing that it will provide financial relief to middle-class voters as soon as the end of the year.
    


            The vice president will also use the opportunity to take aim at Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, who is up for reelection in 2026 and a top target for Republicans' bid to keep control of the chamber.
    


            In a statement, Vance communications director Will Martin highlighted provisions increasing the child tax credit and creating a new tax deduction for older Americans — while vowing to attack Ossoff for voting against the broader domestic policy law.
    


            Trump administration officials have narrowed their rhetoric since passing the multitrillion-dollar bill, focusing on a small handful of tax provisions that they believe will resonate with Americans in the run-up to next year's midterm elections.
    


            The more focused messaging effort represents a significant departure from the White House's stance earlier this year, when Trump insisted on passing as wide-ranging a package as possible so that “there's something for everyone.”
    


            California's Supreme Court yesterday rejected a challenge from state Republicans who filed a lawsuit with the court earlier this week requesting it stop the state's redistricting effort.
    


                    “The petition for writ of mandate and application for stay are denied. Petitioners have failed to meet their burden of establishing a basis for relief at this time under California Constitution article IV, section 8,” according to the court's docket.
                





            State GOP lawmakers had attempted to stop the proposed constitutional amendment from making it onto the ballot when they filed the lawsuit on the grounds that the legislature didn't give voters enough notice.
    


            Republican state Sen. Tony Strickland said the decision is “not the end of this fight,” writing in a post on X: “We will continue to challenge this unconstitutional power grab in the courts and at the ballot box. Californians deserve fair, transparent elections, not secret backroom deals to protect politicians.”
    


            The state Assembly and Senate will consider a trio of bills that will allow for a special election to pass a constitutional amendment to replace the state's existing congressional maps through 2030. From there, Democrats in the state must convince Californians to overturn the congressional maps drafted by the independent redistricting commission voters first empowered to draw the lines in 2010.
    


            The push in California is a reaction to President Donald Trump and Texas Republicans' effort to redraw the maps in Texas mid-decade ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
    


            Meanwhile, we have some updates on Trump's push for peace between Russia and Ukraine: Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is accusing Ukraine and Europe of undermining US efforts to resolve the conflict, following the Alaska summit between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.
    


            Lavrov said Kyiv's goals run counter to the joint Russian-US push to “eliminate the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis.”
    


            Lavrov also claimed European representatives were deliberately trying to “disrupt the agenda” to achieve a sustainable peace settlement by “ignoring Russian interests” and shifting the discussion toward providing security guarantees for Ukraine without Russia's participation. He expressed hope that what he called a “conspiracy” would fail, vowing Moscow would continue following the path “clearly agreed upon” during the Alaska talks.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also told journalists yesterday he is ready to make “some compromise” on his demand that a ceasefire takes place before any talks with Putin — as long as some security guarantees for Ukraine are established.
    


            His comments come as Moscow openly contradicts the White House narrative that plans for a bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelensky are “underway.”
    


            Lavrov said yesterday that the Kremlin proposed sending higher-level officials to talks with Ukraine, with no confirmation that Russia supports a meeting at the leadership level between Putin and Zelensky.
    


            A day after he hosted a summit of US and European leaders at the White House, Trump reiterated his desire to quickly set up a meeting between the Ukrainian and Russian presidents. Trump then aims to hold a trilateral sit-down with Putin and Zelensky.
    


            California Democrats are taking up their proposed constitutional amendment to temporarily redraw their congressional maps, hours after Republicans in the Texas House passed new maps of their own.
    


            After weeks of opposition and days of heated committee meetings and floor debates, lawmakers in both states are on track to pass their redistricting efforts today.
    


In California, the state Assembly and Senate will consider a trio of bills that will allow for a special election to pass a constitutional amendment to replace the state's existing congressional maps through 2030. From there, Democrats in the state must convince Californians to overturn the congressional maps drafted by the independent redistricting commission voters first empowered to draw the lines in 2010.
    


            California Democrats have described their redistricting push as reaction to the Texas plan and President Donald Trump's effort to create a more favorable 2026 midterm election map. The legislation includes a trigger clause that says the state will only move forward if other states — such as Texas — seek to implement their own mid-decade redistricting.
    


In Texas, meanwhile, the state House yesterday evening approved new congressional maps — an 88-52 vote on party lines that came two days after the Democrats who had fled the state, denying the House a quorum for 15 days, returned to Austin. The Republican-dominated state Senate is reconvening tonight, and the redistricting plan's passage there is all but certain.
    


            Democrats are seeking to gain five seats in California, while Republicans are eyeing five additional seats in Texas.
    


            The legislature will consider the proposed referendum, as well as two related bills, starting today. All three need a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers to pass. If passed, voters would be able to weigh in on whether they want to allow the legislature to override the congressional lines drawn by the state's independent redistricting commission to put in place new lines through 2030.
    


            Democrats have tried everything to beat Donald Trump.
    


            But they're only 1 for 3 in presidential elections against him.
    


            Twice, they impeached him — but that didn't destroy his political career.
    


            Several top Democratic prosecutors brought the force of the law against him, but in trying to bring him down, they only made him stronger.
    


            They've tried to “go high” when he went low. But he went lower and won.
    


            And painting Trump as the worst-ever threat to American democracy didn't thwart the greatest White House comeback story in history.
    


            So, what do Democrats do now?
    


            The latest plan, piloted by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose counteroffensive just won the support of former President Barack Obama, is to be a bit more like Trump — but only up to a point and for a limited time.
    


            California state legislators are expected on Thursday to pass bills to set up a statewide referendum in November on redrawing the state's congressional maps in a way that could net Democrats five seats in the House of Representatives.
    


            The counterattack went into force after deep-red Texas enacted its plan, ordered by the president, to launch a rare mid-cycle redistricting effort in search of five Republican House seats. Trump is blatantly attempting to save the GOP — and himself — from losing the chamber in the 2026 midterms and is prepared to do anything to prevent it.

Italian police have arrested a Ukrainian man who it is claimed is suspected of involvement in the bombing of the Nord Stream gas pipelines, German prosecutors reported on Thursday.

The man, referred to only as Sergey K, was detained near Rimini on the basis of a European arrest warrant. German investigators believe he led a unit that blew up sections of the pipelines in September 2022.

The attacks, which ruptured both the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines in the Baltic Sea, were, improbably, initially blamed on Russian operatives. But German prosecutors later traced a rented sailing yacht to the operation and linked it to Ukrainian nationals.

Investigators say Sergey K was part of a group that placed explosives on the pipelines near the island of Bornholm in September 2022. The accused was allegedly one of the coordinators of the operation. He and his accomplices are said to have used a sailing yacht that departed from the German city of Rostock. The vessel had previously been rented from a German company through intermediaries using forged identification documents. 

“After being transferred from Italy, the accused will be brought before the investigating judge of the Federal Court of Justice,” according to the statement by the prosecutor's office. 

Germany's Federal Prosecutor General has reportedly been investigating the blasts for more than two years on suspicion of sabotage and causing explosives to be detonated. The explosions were seen at the time as an attack on critical energy infrastructure and a stark example of the rising economic fallout of the Ukraine conflict.

In 2023, veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published a report claiming that then-US President Joe Biden had given the order to destroy Nord Stream. According to an informed source who talked to the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, the explosives had been planted by US Navy divers a few months earlier under the cover of a NATO exercise. The White House denied the report at the time, calling it “complete fiction.”

Continued detention of Mario Guevara is retaliation for his reporting and violates his first amendment rights, filing says

The ACLU called Immigration and Customs Enforcement's continued detention of Atlanta-area journalist Mario Guevara an act of retaliation for his reporting on immigration raids, according to a federal petition filed on Thursday.

Guevara, a Salvadorian immigrant who has been in the United States for more than 20 years, was arrested on 14 June by a police officer in suburban Atlanta while covering the “No Kings” day protests in a neighborhood with a high density of immigrants. Despite all charges being dropped, Guevara has been in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention in south Georgia for almost two months, the only journalist in the US imprisoned as a consequence of their work today, the ACLU said.

Guevara founded MG News, a social media-driven news organization that has become increasingly important to his Spanish-speaking audience for his coverage of Ice activities in metro Atlanta. As he was being arrested, Guevara was livestreaming on Facebook to more than a million followers.

“The government's continuing detention of Mr Guevara on the basis of his journalism is intended to silence him, prevent him from reporting in the future, and retaliate against him for his past speech and reporting, in violation of the first amendment,” the filing in the Brunswick, Georgia, courthouse states. “The government's continuing detention of Mr Guevara also violates the substantive due process clause of the fifth amendment because it has no legitimate objective and is punitive.”

Guevara has no criminal history and has been issued a work permit. An immigration judge administratively closed an order for his deportation a decade ago. The oldest of his two children who are US citizens has sponsored his green card application.

After his arrest in June, DeKalb county prosecutors dropped the misdemeanor charges against Guevara almost immediately. The sheriff's office of neighboring Gwinnett county – taking issue with his livestreaming a prostitution arrest a month earlier – filed misdemeanor traffic charges shortly after Guevara's arrest. Gwinnett prosecutors dropped those charges days later.

Nonetheless, Guevara is still in the Folkston Ice detention center and faces removal.

An immigration judge issued a $7,500 bond for Guevara in June, but immigration enforcement officials appealed that bond decision and it is now on hold with no date set to hear the appeal. The ACLU filing attempts to induce the federal court to intervene.

Referring to the bond hearing in June, the ACLU noted that the immigration judge recognized the first amendment implications of his detention. The judge said in his bond order that “if respondent was acting as a journalist, he is protected by freedom of speech as detailed in the constitution and longstanding, precedential case law”, and noted that “reporting on Ice raids in the community, as respondent has done, is a national concern and many other journalists across the nation are also reporting on this issue”.

Immigration enforcement officials have argued in court that Guevara presents a danger to the community because he livestreams, records and publishes law enforcement activities and shares his reporting with the public. The ACLU filing details Guevara's extensive cooperation with law enforcement over the years, and notes that a metro Atlanta law enforcement officer testified on his behalf at the bond hearing.

In its filing, the ACLU argues that it is “highly unusual” for the government to appeal an immigration judge's decision to grant bond when someone has no significant criminal history and presents strong evidence that he's not a danger to the community.

“The government generally reserves bond appeals, and especially stays, for cases involving serious criminal conduct, clear evidence of danger to the community or major flight risk,” the ACLU wrote, adding that the government relies almost exclusively on “Mr Guevara's reporting as justification for his continued detention”.

The ACLU noted that immigration officials presented Guevara's live stream of a Gwinnett county sheriff's office operation in its argument against issuing a bond in July. “The livestreaming videos that formed the basis for the misdemeanor traffic violations are no longer available on the MG News or Mr Guevara's Facebook pages,” the ACLU filing states. “Neither Mr Guevara nor an employee of MG News removed these videos from these Facebook pages. Mr Guevara is not aware of how or why the videos were removed.”

The petition asks for the court to demand an answer to the petition within three days, for Guevara's bond case to be removed to federal court, for the stay on his bond to be lifted, and for the court to declare that Ice's effort to continue detention violates the first amendment and the due process clause of the fifth amendment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theguardian.com","Russia orders state-backed Max messenger app to be pre-installed on new phones","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/21/russia-max-app-phones","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 17:50:00 GMT","

Critics say Max, a WhatsApp rival, could be used to track users, though state media says it is not a spying app

A Russian state-backed messenger application called Max, a rival to WhatsApp that critics say could be used to track users, must be pre-installed on all mobile phones and tablets bought in the country starting next month, the Russian government said on Thursday.

The decision to promote Max comes as Moscow, locked in a standoff with the west over Ukraine, is seeking greater control over the internet. The Kremlin said in a statement that Max, which will be integrated with government services, would be on a list of mandatory pre-installed apps on all “gadgets”, including mobile phones and tablets, sold in Russia from 1 September. The firm behind Max said this week that 18 million users had downloaded its app, parts of which are still in a testing phase.

State media says accusations from Kremlin critics that Max is a spying app are false and that it has fewer permissions to access user data than rivals WhatsApp and Telegram.

It will also be mandatory from 1 September for Russia's domestic app store, RuStore, which is pre-installed on all Android devices, to be pre-installed on Apple devices. A Russian-language TV app called Lime HD TV, which allows people to watch state TV channels free of charge, will be pre-installed on all smart TVs sold in Russia from 1 January.

The push to promote homegrown apps comes after Russia said this month it had started restricting some calls on WhatsApp, owned by Meta Platforms, and on Telegram, accusing the foreign-owned platforms of failing to share information with law enforcement in fraud and terrorism cases.

WhatsApp, which in July had a reach of 97.3 million users in Russia, responded by accusing Moscow of trying to block Russians from accessing secure communications, while Telegram, which had a reach of 90.8 million users, said it actively combats the harmful use of its platform.

The third most popular messenger app in July, according to Mediascope data, was VK Messenger, at 17.9 million users, an offering from the same state-controlled tech company VK which developed Max.

Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook is latest figure targeted by Trump administration over claims of mortgage fraud

The Trump administration is ratcheting up pressure on the Federal Reserve to remove governor Lisa Cook, after the economist declared she had “no intention of being bullied” into stepping down.

Cook, who was appointed to the US central bank's powerful board of governors by Joe Biden, has been accused by Donald Trump's officials of committing mortgage fraud. The allegations are unconfirmed.

The US president has waged an extraordinary war on the Fed's independence, breaking with precedent to demand interest rate cuts and urge its chair, Jerome Powell, to resign. Trump promptly called on Cook to quit on Wednesday.

The Department of Justice is reported to have indicated it is investigating the allegations, with a top Trump official telling Powell the case “requires further examination” – and calling on him to remove Cook from the Fed's board.

“At this time, I encourage you to remove Ms Cook from your Board,” Ed Martin, the official, wrote in a letter, according to Bloomberg News. “Do it today before it is too late! After all, no American thinks it is appropriate that she serve during this time with a cloud hanging over her.”

The Fed declined to comment. The justice department declined to comment.

Despite Martin's demand, the Fed chair has no authority under the Federal Reserve Act to remove another member of the board of governors. On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump had discussed how to fire Cook for cause, citing an unnamed administration official.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the report.

On Wednesday morning, Bill Pulte, head of the US Federal Housing Finance Agency, who has become – beyond the president himself – one of the Trump administration's most vocal critics of Powell and the Fed, published allegations against Cook.

In June 2021, Cook entered into a 15-year mortgage agreement on a property in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and declared her intention to use it as her principal residence, according to Pulte. In July 2021, Cook bought a property in Atlanta, Georgia, and also committed to use that property as her primary residence when taking out a 30-year mortgage, according to Pulte.

In a statement, Cook said: “I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.”

She is the latest figure to be targeted by Trump officials over claims of mortgage fraud. Pulte has made similar allegations about the New York attorney general, Letitia James, and the California senator Adam Schiff, both Democrats. The justice department is reportedly investigating.

James has dismissed the claims as “baseless”, while Schiff has vehemently denied the allegations, and accused the administration of weaponizing the US justice system.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

U.S. President Donald Trump referred to Crimea as a piece of land ""right in the ocean"" that is ""the size of Texas"" while talking on the Mark Levin Show, a right-wing talk radio program, on Aug. 20. 

""It's beautiful. It's, you know, this massive piece of land stuck out right in the ocean, right in the Black Sea. So beautiful. I mean, it's so beautiful,"" he told Levin, before adding that Ukraine was told by former U.S. President Barack Obama to ""give it up to Russia.""

Russia invaded Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in February 2014 amid the deadliest days of the EuroMaidan Revolution that eventually ousted Ukraine's pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. Around 30,000 Russian troops crossed into Crimea, taking hold of the peninsula by early March 2014 and soon declaring its illegal annexation. 

At the time, Russia's annexation of Crimea represented the largest seizure of land in Europe since World War II — now second only to Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 

Here's what you need to know about Crimea and Russia's ongoing occupation.

Crimea is roughly 26 times smaller than Texas and is not located ""in the middle of the ocean"" — it is a peninsula in the Black Sea, around 27,000 square kilometers (10,400 square miles) in size. It is roughly the same size as the U.S. state of Massachusetts or the country of Haiti.

Texas, meanwhile, is a little over 10% larger than the entire territory of Ukraine.

Crimea is connected to Ukraine by land to the north, where it meets Kherson Oblast, which Russia has partially occupied since 2022. As well as the Black Sea, the peninsula lies on the western shores of the Sea of Azov.

The only access from Russia to Crimea is via the Kerch Bridge, a 19-kilometer (12-mile) bridge built by Moscow after Russia annexed the peninsula. The bridge is a highly strategic (and illegal) construction that Ukraine regularly targets due to its role as a critical transport route for Russian forces to occupied Ukrainian territories.

The bridge suffered significant damage in Ukrainian attacks in October 2022 and July 2023. On June 3, Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) confirmed it had carried out a third strike targeting the bridge, detonating 1,100 kilograms of explosives beneath its underwater supports.

After Russia moved its forces into Crimea in early 2014, Moscow swiftly held a sham referendum in the absence of any international observers and with armed Russian soldiers present at polling locations. Russian occupation authorities claimed that 97% of voters were in favor of annexation.

While Trump blamed Obama on the Mark Levin show for Russia's annexation, in April 2025, he questioned why Ukraine “didn't fight” for Crimea. 

“Why didn't they fight for it eleven years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?” he wrote on his Truth Social platform on April 23.

There are multiple reasons why Russia was able to take Crimea so easily. Foremost among them is that Moscow had been building up its military in the region for years, meaning that Russian military strength exceeded that of Ukraine's in Crimea. 

The Kremlin had been amassing troops in Crimea for years thanks to agreements with Ukraine's pro-Russian President Yanukovych that allowed it to station its Black Sea Fleet on the peninsula and move its troops around without restrictions. It also covertly brought modernized or refurbished equipment into Crimea between 2010 and 2014, according to Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR). 

Russia also timed its annexation at the moment of a volatile political crisis in Kyiv in March 2014, at the conclusion of the EuroMaidan Revolution, leaving Kyiv unable to organize a defense of the peninsula. 

At the same time, the U.S. and the U.K. — signatories of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, which pledged to uphold Ukraine's territorial integrity in exchange for Kyiv surrendering its nuclear arsenal — did not come to Ukraine's defense.

While Russia claims that Crimea is Russian, the native inhabitants of Crimea are Crimean Tatars, the peninsula's indigenous people and a national minority of Ukraine. Their history is marked by centuries of conflict and repression at the hands of Moscow, something that has only continued under Russian occupation to this day. 

Before the Russian Empire conquered Crimea in 1783, Crimean Tatars made up the vast majority of the population. In 1785, Russians only made up about 2.2% of the population of Crimea. 

Due to centuries of oppression of Crimea's native population, Russians comprised 74.4% of Crimea by the end of the Soviet Union. The greatest blow to the indigenous population came in 1944, when the Soviets falsely accused the entire Crimean Tatar people of collaborating with Nazi Germany, which occupied Crimea for two years.

Up to 200,000 Crimean Tatars – mostly women, children, and the elderly – were deported to Central Asia and Siberia on Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin's orders.

Crimean Tatars were only able to return to their homeland 40 years later. Among them were the families of well-known Ukrainians, including former defense minister Rustem Umerov and singer Jamala.

Ukraine, as well as countries including the Netherlands, Lithuania, Latvia, and Canada, recognize the 1944 deportation of Crimean Tatars as genocide.

“It's so beautiful,” Trump repeatedly told Levin on Aug. 20, a statement all Ukrainians would likely agree with. As well as being the homeland of Crimean Tatars, the peninsula was an immensely popular summer vacation destination for generations of Ukrainians.

Among Ukrainians, Crimea evokes memories of carefree vacations, time spent with family, and peace. Now, Russia has transformed Crimea into a strategic base for supporting the occupation of other Ukrainian territories. 

Areas that were once popular vacation destinations have now been converted into military bases for Russian soldiers. Over 10 years of Russian occupation, the local economy also shifted toward the military-industrial complex, with Russia reviving Soviet-era military factories. 

A representative of the Crimean Combat Seagulls, a Ukrainian resistance movement active on the peninsula, who spoke on condition of anonymity, recently told the Kyiv Independent that Russia's militarization of Crimea has only accelerated since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.

""Crimea currently serves two functions: as a springboard for potential offensive operations and as a base for supplying Russian forces in southern Ukraine.""

The U.S. was reportedly considering recognizing Crimea as Russian in April 2025 — a move that would violate international law. 

Russia's annexation in 2014 was widely condemned and dismissed by the U.S., the EU, and most members of the U.N. The U.S. and EU responded by imposing asset freezes, travel bans, and other sanctions on various Russian officials involved in the military occupation.

During his first term in office, Trump even reaffirmed the U.S.'s opposition to Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea by adopting the Crimea Declaration.

Issued by then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the declaration stated that the U.S. “rejects Russia's attempted annexation of Crimea and pledges to maintain this policy until Ukraine's territorial integrity is restored.”

If the U.S. ever decided to recognize Crimea as part of Russia, it would also be impossible for Kyiv to agree to or condone such a move.

According to Ukraine's constitution, Crimea is a legally recognized and inseparable part of Ukraine, and no acts can be passed by the Ukrainian government that contradict it. Ukraine's constitution also can't be changed during martial law.

Trump's administration will know within two weeks whether there will be peace in Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Aug. 21 in an interview on the Todd Starnes Show,  warning that if not, he will ""take a different tact."" 

These comments are the latest in a series of deadlines Trump has set for Ukraine's war — none of which have been followed by action when they came and went. 

""We will know in within two weeks whether there will be peace in Ukraine. After that we will have to maybe take a different tact,"" Trump told conservative commentator Todd Starnes.

Trump met with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Aug. 18, a few days after American president's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. No progress has been achieved.

Trump wrote on Aug. 21 on Truth Social that Ukraine cannot win the war without striking inside Russia, accusing former U.S. President Joe Biden of only allowing Ukraine to ""defend, not fight back."" 

Trump claimed the war would not have happened if he had been in office, adding: ""Interesting times ahead!""

The remarks differ from his position in December 2024, when, in an interview with Time magazine before taking office, he called it a ""big mistake"" for Washington to let Ukraine use U.S.-supplied weapons against targets deep inside Russia, warning such strikes risked dangerous escalation. 

The Biden administration had approved the use of U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles for strikes inside Russia in 2024.

Earlier on Aug. 21, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham demanded that Russia return thousands of Ukrainian children abducted during the war, warning he will push legislation to designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism if Moscow refuses.

""During the course of the Russia-Ukraine war, Russia has kidnapped over 19,000 Ukrainian children. Stealing children from their home country is a despicable and barbaric act,"" Graham wrote on X. ""As I have been saying since earlier this year, I intend to push legislation to designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism under U.S. law if they do not return the children.""

The South Carolina Republican added that such a designation ""will make doing business with Putin's Russia radioactive for other countries and businesses.""

The U.S. currently designates Cuba, North Korea, Iran and Syria as state sponsors of terrorism, a classification made by the secretary of state without congressional approval. 

The label carries sweeping sanctions, including restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance, a ban on defense exports and sales, and financial limitations.

Ukraine says Russia has abducted at least 19,546 children since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, transferring them to Russia, Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, or Belarus. Just 1,560 have been returned, according to the Ukrainian initiative ""Bring Kids Back UA.""

Human rights groups and Ukrainian officials say the real figure is likely far higher, with estimates ranging from 150,000 to 300,000. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets and other officials have warned that Moscow has systematized the deportations, with children placed in Russian foster families or adoption programs.

Ukrainian NGO Save Ukraine denounced Russia on Aug. 6 after discovering an online ""catalog"" of children maintained by Russian occupation authorities in Luhansk Oblast. The database lists 294 children, many with Ukrainian citizenship, sorted by traits such as eye and hair color, according to the group. 

Some children were issued Russian identification documents to legitimize their abduction, while others had lost parents to Russian forces.

The demand to return abducted children has been one of key points part of Ukraine's peace talks with Russia.

Globe and Mail editor Catherine Dawson March and her daughter rode bikes around Calgary when their Air Canada flight was delayed during the strike.Catherine Dawson March/The Globe and Mail

Like hundreds of thousands of other travellers this past week, my daughter and I were left stranded during the Air Canada strike. Less than 30 minutes after our flight's official cancellation on Aug. 16, I couldn't find two seats back to Toronto from Calgary on any airline at any price. The closest I could get was Hamilton – nearly two hours from my home – on a different airline, four days hence and at twice the original ticket cost. The customer service agent said I should consider myself lucky.

Lucky!? But it was an interesting thought. Maybe I could reframe this major inconvenience. I mean, what else could I do? Previously, I'd only passed through Calgary on my way to ski resorts. What would I find in the height of summer?

Where to stay?

First, I booked a room at the Fairmont Palliser, located in the heart of downtown. There was no way I was hanging out near the airport – a 45-minute bus ride away – for four days. The historic hotel had a great location, a pool, a spa and bikes to borrow, all of which could come in handy with our days wide open. Walking into the marble-pillared lobby felt like stepping back into the Gilded Age, and the hotel was hopping with two weddings and a buzzing lobby bar/restaurant. The people-watching was a good distraction; this is obviously where many Calgarians have celebrated for decades, judging by the old photos that line many corridors. Even Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip dropped by in 1993.

Start exploring

Since the weather was fine, the Bow River was a magnet. We cycled breezily along the riverside path, which was busy with pedestrians, scooter traffic and other bike-riders. We stopped to listen to an outdoor country music festival in the East Village, then parked our bicycles at the Confluence parkland, the site of Fort Calgary and the Métis Hunt House. A student docent explained the small log cabin, built in the 1870s, was once part of the Hudson's Bay Co. trading post. It was a great, tangible nugget of Canadian history and we talked about it as we rode farther along the river. A lot farther. 

My daughter wanted to check out an adorable cafe in Fish Creek Provincial Park (part of the Bow Ranch parkland) – 50 kilometres there and back. We needed a way to work off our frustration with being stuck, and the scenery and living-like-a-local feeling made the saddle sores worth it. We skirted all sorts of neighbourhoods and parklands (including thigh-high grasslands and bird-filled wetlands), cycled past highways, a golf course and train tracks, and even rode up a switchback hill to look back at the Calgary skyline. 

Cyclists on faster bikes nodded sympathetically at our heavy cruisers but we managed. My only regret was not jumping into the water fully clothed at Harvie Passage, a conduit off the Bow where families float along gentle rapids. 

Getting our cowboy on

On another day, we stumbled upon the Smithbilt hat factory in Inglewood. For two city slickers with a secret crush on Western wear it was a lot of fun. We tried on hats, boots and fringed jackets, and wondered where we could possibly wear them back home. The longer I was in town, the more easily I could convince myself that cowboy boots were essential. When a fellow shopper mistook me for a local, I was thrilled. 

On his recommendation, we headed back downtown to Alberta Boot, a local maker established in 1978. We opened the door and stepped into the smell of leather and money. The shop showcased boots of all shapes and colours, denim dresses, horse-print fashions, blinged-out shirts and hats ready for shaping and branding. 

Alberta Boot Co. customers often want to customize everything from the leathers, colours, stitch patterns and heel shapes – and some even have their personal branding burned in.Catherine Dawson March/The Globe and Mail

But the best part was the working boot factory visible through a glass wall at the back. Visitors can ask for a quick tour, and that's how I met master bootmaker Antonio Juarez, who learned the trade from his father and grandfather in Mexico and has worked here for 23 years. The contract to make RCMP boots is steady and he's always busy around Stampede time, but he's surprised at how the demand for custom work has skyrocketed. 

“In the last two years the customization of the boots has exploded,” Juarez said. “Every boot that we have in the factory now except for one or two racks of stock boots … is specialized.” Customers want to choose their own leathers, colours, stitch patterns and heel shapes, and have their personal branding burned in – with price being no object.

Food, books and fun

The lively patio scene along pedestrian Stephen Avenue drew us back often (Sunday all-day happy hour!), but we were also charmed by the rest of this national historic district, where shops and restaurants fill the onetime banks and low-rise office buildings. The architecture is a gorgeous mix of decorative styles from the Edwardian, Victorian, art deco and beaux-arts eras. 

One afternoon we spotted Pho Daddy on 4th Street SW. Its outdoor wrought-iron staircase reminded us of Montreal. Inside, friendly counter staff let us sample the different broths before we ordered enormous steaming bowls of hearty pho. Vietnamese iced coffee was served in an authentic phin drip filter and far surpassed any I've ever had. With apologies to the Alberta beef industry, it was one of the best meals of our visit. 

Right next door, we spent a delightfully long time browsing the stacks of Shelf Life Books, an independent seller specializing in titles from small publishers and Canadian authors. 

I flipped through Shaun Hunter's Calgary Through the Eyes of Writers, but left it behind. I already knew what I had to bring home from this unexpected holiday in Calgary. We turned back to Alberta Boot's factory shop. I'd decide when I got there whether to have my boot heel personally branded.

The writer received a media rate for Fairmont Palliser. It did not review or approve the story before publication.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","A German town's bid to break China's grip on rare earths","https://www.dw.com/en/german-town-of-bitterfeld-leads-eu-rare-earth-recycling-push-to-end-reliance-on-chinese-imports/a-73424082","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 03:46:21 GMT","

The small German town of Bitterfeld is leading Europe's push to recycle rare earth elements that are vital for the tech and defense sector. Can this help reduce the continent's overreliance on Chinese imports?

With its orchards of low-growing fruit trees and a harbor dotted with yachts, Bitterfeld has an air of pastoral charm. But this former East German town, about 140 kilometers (86 miles) southwest of Berlin, also has a less bucolic side.

A shallow lake called the Silbersee is a reminder of a disused lignite mine that once provided fuel, while a tangle of pipes from one of Germany's oldest chemical facilities has long added an industrial twist to the skyline.

Recently, this town of two tales has taken on a third persona, quietly emerging as a hub for the EU's drive to source rare earths on home turf.

Vital to the manufacture of permanent magnets that show up in consumer electronics, renewables, and defense technologies, these chemical elements are largely sourced in China. As a result, Europe is dependent on exports — something it would like to change. Enter Bitterfeld.  

The idea is to recycle rare earth elements from end-of-life electronic devices. In May 2024, the family-run German tech group Heraeus opened its facility, a grey rectangular building shielded by a high barbed-wire fence, for that purpose.

At its launch, the site was presented as ""the largest rare earth magnet recycling plant in Europe.""

Initially,  it aimed to produce around 600 tons of rare earth magnetic powder per year, with plans to double this figure to 1,200 tons in the near future. But that's not quite how things have panned out.

A year after the launch, Heraeus says the facility is struggling to break even, despite the field's potential strategic importance.

""I cannot disclose the exact number, but we are nowhere near full capacity,"" David Christian Bender, co-head of Heraeus Remloy, told DW, adding that European recycling ""cannot compete"" with rare earth metal deliveries from China.

Four industrial sectors in Germany are particularly dependent on rare earth imports: the automotive industry, mechanical and plant engineering, energy, and defense. One of the key minerals they need is neodymium.

Found in countless smart devices, from electric motors and wind turbines to MRI scanners and smartphone speakers, this silvery-white metal is the holy grail of the high-tech economy. The element, primarily in the form of neodymium-iron-boron magnets, is also crucial for military applications.

""These magnets are used in precision-guided weapons, radar and sonar systems, satellite communications, and the acoustic signature reduction on military vehicles,"" Stefan Steinicke from the Federation of German Industries (BDI) told DW.

Although Europe possesses some reserves, it does not currently mine neodymium. In fact, the continent imports 100% of its heavy rare earth elements (REEs), such as terbium, and 85% of its light rare earth elements, including neodymium, from China. The country also produces 90% of the world's magnets.

""When it comes to electric motors, robotics and drones, import dependency is not only high, but system-critical,"" Steinicke said.

Short-term import stoppages lead to production delays, supply bottlenecks, and price hikes. Longer-term disruptions could result in project cancellations in key tech sectors and cause strategic uncertainty among investors.

In April this year, China severely restrictedits exports of several heavy rare earth metals and rare earth magnets, leading to a drastic shortfall in Europe. In some parts of Germany, production lines came to a standstill.

In 2024, the EU introduced its Critical Raw Materials Act. By 2030, Europe aims to mine at least 10% of the raw materials it requires, process 40%, and recycle 25%. Dependence on any single non-EU country is to be reduced to a maximum of 65%.

Experts welcome the targets but regard them as ambitious, saying the EU needs to move faster, make greater investments and be more creative with its policy tools.

The mining-to-magnet production chain is long and costly. ""A green mine is an oxymoron. It always involves environmental degradation and pollution,"" said Pascal Leroy, Director General of the WEEE Forum, a Brussels-based non-profit focused on electronic waste.

Short-loop recycling, in turn, uses vacuum melting, skipping the dirtiest, most energy-hungry steps found in the longer recycling loop. It is, therefore, held up as a cleaner alternative to mining. 

Aside from Heraeus Remloy, several other European companies are racing to lead in REE-recycling. But finding customers willing to pay extra to support European producers remains difficult.

Jan Giese, a senior manager at TRADIUM, a German metal products distributor says the challenges are due to ""relatively high prices for interesting scrap material,"" higher European production costs, ""lower recycling capacities and resulting poorer economies of scale.""

According to TRADIUM, the price of neodymium oxide has been gradually declining, albeit with certain volatility, since March 2022, reaching one of its low points around mid-2024. This further adds to recyclers' profitability struggles.

So far, less than 1% of the rare earths consumed in the EU are recycled, a press officer for the EU Commission told DW. And though Brussels has approved several projects to help tap private funding, it is not likely to tip the scales in any big way.

Early next year, the EU is planning to launch a special platform connecting buyers and suppliers of strategic raw materials to diversify sourcing. 

""Recycling quotas could be part of a solution,"" Jürgen Hardt, foreign policy spokesman for Germany's conservative CDU/CSU parliamentary bloc, told DW.

Highlighting the need for ""a coherent political effort that combines a mosaic of measures,"" he did not rule out a tax credit for magnets manufactured domestically or made from reclaimed components. Such steps, however, should be taken ""in close coordination within the EU,"" he added.

Nearly 50% of all e-waste in the European Union remains uncollected, and less than 40% is recycled. The Commission plans to revise the WEEE Directive, an EU regulation on electronic waste management, to better align collection, treatment, and market incentives.

According to Leroy, Brussels needs to introduce dedicated waste codes for permanent magnets so they can be traced and recycled before going missing or being exported.

Together with its partners, the WEEE Forum has also created an online Urban Mine Platform highlighting the volume of precious materials in EU waste — equivalent to roughly the weight of three million African elephants.

Bender, co-head of Heraeus Remloy, hopes to see a swift introduction of measures to boost the recycling of rare earth elements. He is calling for mandatory quotas and financial or tax incentives for using recycled European magnets, especially in the car industry.

""The situation is very challenging... If nothing is done right now, I can't see any change happening by 2030,"" he added — despite the goals set in Brussels.

As Gavin Newsom attempts to cement his place as the likely Democratic candidate for the 2028 election, he is turning to a familiar playbook.

The California governor's social media account has been filled with a torrent of long rants in capital letters, AI memes of himself topless riding bears and a series of pithy nicknames for his political enemies.

So far, it seems to be working.

The 57-year-old has packed his communications department with Gen-Z advisers who are helping the Democrat Maga-fy himself by mimicking Donald Trump and riling up his Republican base in turn.

The strategy has earned team Newsom ample news coverage and thousands of new followers but it is his success in triggering the Magasphere that has left him feeling the most smug.

In one AI meme, shared by the governor, Mr Newsom's visage has been added to Mount Rushmore. In another his cartoonishly inflated muscles bulge from underneath his vest while he waves a star spangled banner.

Mr Trump's supporters, Tucker Carlson, Kid Rock and the late Hulk Hogan appearing in angel form, pray over the governor in another provocative AI image.

“DONALD IS FINISHED — HE IS NO LONGER ‘HOT,'” Mr Newsom's office declared on Aug14.

“FIRST THE HANDS (SO TINY) AND NOW ME — GAVIN C. NEWSOM — HAVE TAKEN AWAY HIS ‘STEP'. MANY ARE SAYING HE CAN'T EVEN DO THE ‘BIG STAIRS' ON AIR FORCE ONE ANY MORE — USES THE LITTLE BABY STAIRS NOW.”

Abigail Jackson, the deputy White House press secretary, shot back, decrying the governor, who was evoking her boss, as “very weird and not at all funny”.

Dana Perino, the Fox News host, who appeared to miss his ironic tone, earnestly advised Mr Newsom that if he wanted to run for president he needed to “be a little more serious”.

Mr Newsom's team jumped on the criticism, with an all-caps post filled with name-calling, cheap attacks and bragging.

The post read:

The governor has brushed off criticism of his brash new strategy, claiming he is issuing a “wake-up call” to Mr Trump.

“I'm sort of following his example. If you've got issues with what I'm putting out, you sure as hell should have concerns about what he's putting out as president,” he said.

Prior to his transformation to full-blown Maga antagonist, Mr Newsom had been creeping increasingly to the centre, launching a podcast where he hosted guests from across the political divide.

Charlie Kirk, Steve Bannon and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich have all appeared on his new show called This is Gavin Newsom.

In March, Mr Newsom broke with his party to criticise the inclusion of trans athletes in women's sports.

But his embrace of the Right-wing was short-lived and Democrats argue Mr Newsom's parody social media posts cast him as the official Republican opposition.

“The definition of insanity, as the old saying goes, is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result, and it's certainly different,” Jason Ortiz, the Democratic strategist, said of the governor's social media activity.

“There's no question that a front on the battlefield is online, social media and to date there are few Democrats who have been able to use those tools effectively and to really get the kind of attention that the Right has been very good at capturing,” he said.

Mr Ortiz said Mr Newsom's strategy “to fight fire with fire is generally a very positive thing”.

His comments reflect a growing sentiment in the Democratic Party and its base that its politicians need to stop taking the high road.

“The big divide in the Democrats right now is not, you know, liberals versus establishment, or progressives versus liberals, it's very much, are you a fighter or are you not?” said Christopher Galdieri, a politics professor at Saint Anselm.

Mr Newsom's Maga tweets show him as someone willing to put his head above the parapet and go tete-a-tete with his political rivals.

“It's a clear sign of ambitions about 2028 and I think he's banking on the idea that Democrats are going to be asking the candidates for president, whoever they might be, ‘what did you do? How soon did you do it and how aggressive were you?'”

But is this tongue-in-cheek approach a winning strategy outside the confines of the social media bubble?

Mr Galdieri said this tactic could “backfire” if Democrats decide they do not want a “Tweeter-in-chief”.

Jennifer Grygiel, an associate professor at Syracuse University who specialises in memes and social media, said she did not think being anti-Trump was a winning formula.

“Honestly, Gavin Newsom, the guy looks like he's a step away from a villain,” Prof Grygiel said.

“Following Trump is a slippery slope for anyone who actually paints themselves or actually is authentically somebody who's trying to do something progressive. So taking on a Trumpian tone... I can't just see politicians memeing their way into office,” they said.

“I think, for better or for worse, maybe he is emerging as something that is new, but maybe not necessarily better.”

Trying to outdo Mr Trump at being Mr Trump is a losing game, according to Amy Koch, a Republican strategist.

“I have seen people try to sort of mimic Trump or mock Trump. I just don't know that anybody can outdo Trump, even in like, the kind of outrageous funniness of it, so I don't think it's going to be effective,” she said.

While Ms Koch said the social media shift might help Mr Newsom lock up the Democratic nomination for 2028, she did not think it would translate well to the electorate as a whole.

“I think that, in general for independents and centre-Right people, it's just too much,” she said.

“It will get old, it will get worn out, if it's not already, and it won't work... in general people, just everyday people aren't paying attention to Twitter.”

Barack Obama has backed Gavin Newsom's plan to redraw California's voting map.

The former US president said it was a necessary step to stave off Donald Trump's efforts to redistrict Texas, which would favour Republicans in the state.

“I think that approach is a smart, measured approach,” Mr Obama said during a fundraiser for the Democratic Party's main redistricting arm.

Mr Newsom has proposed redrawing California's voting districts to create five new winnable Democratic House seats, a direct counter to the Texas House's approval of a new map to create more conservative-leaning seats in that state.

The California plan is designed to flip as many Republican-held seats as those that will be created under the new Texas map.

On Thursday, Texas's Republican-controlled state Senate approved the new districts, making the Trump-approved maps official, however California faces a more uncertain route.

First, Democrats must use their supermajority in the California state legislature to approve the changes by a two-thirds margin. Then they must schedule a special election in November for voters to approve the new map.

Mr Newsom has until Friday to meet ballot deadlines. Politicians in both Texas and California, America's two most populous states, were voting on the new maps on Thursday.

California has a voter-approved independent commission that Mr Newsom himself had backed.

Only voters can override the current map, approved in 2021. However, Mr Newsom said extraordinary steps are required to counter Texas and other Republican-led states the US president is pushing to revise maps.

“This is a new Democratic Party, this is a new day, this is new energy out there all across this country,” the California governor said. “And we're going to fight fire with fire.”

Earlier this month, Texas Democrats fled the state, delaying the passage of the redistricting plan by more than two weeks.

They boarded chartered planes on Aug 3 for New York and Chicago to deny the Republicans the quorum to vote on the redistricting effort, since official business in the Texas legislature requires at least 100 members to be present.

Mr Trump has also pushed Republican leaders in conservative states like Indiana and Missouri to try to create new Republican seats.

Ohio Republicans were already revising their map before Texas moved. Democrats, meanwhile, are mulling reopening Maryland's and New York's maps as well.

FEMA also still owes North Carolina hundreds of millions in promised recovery funds from last year's Hurricane Helene.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

As Hurricane Erin batters the East Coast, North Carolina has been left in the lurch by a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) badly battered by the Trump administration.

WRAL reported Tuesday that the Tar Heel State is still waiting on $13 million in federal disaster preparedness grants from FEMA.

This is on top of the hundreds of millions of dollars in recovery funds for last year's devastating Hurricane Helene, which the agency has promised but not yet delivered.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein told reporters Tuesday that $85 million would begin flowing from FEMA to the state to fund recovery from Helene.

That announcement came after Stein sent US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem a letter in July asking why she had not signed off on the disbursal of the desperately needed funds.

“Applications submitted as far back as February 2025 remain without a final decision,” Stein wrote in the letter, which laid out $209 million worth of Helene recovery projects still awaiting her sign-off. “Further delay of these funds keeps communities and families in limbo, all while we are in another dangerous hurricane season.”

Even though some funds are reportedly flowing, Stein says the government has yet to reimburse North Carolina for over $100 million.

“It creates real financial strain, especially on local governments, but also the state,” Stein said in a press conference.

Noem's leadership of FEMA came under severe scrutiny earlier this summer after it was reported that her policies hampered the agency's ability to respond to the devastating flooding that killed at least 138 people in Texas.

In June, Noem introduced a new policy requiring all FEMA expenditures over $100,000 to be personally approved by her, which officials within the agency said led to the deployment of search and rescue teams being delayed for days.

Two-thirds of the phone calls from desperate Texans to FEMA also went unanswered after Noem allowed hundreds of contractors to be laid off just a day after the storm hit.

The Trump administration, meanwhile, has implemented massive staff cuts to the agencies responsible for hurricane preparedness.

It laid off hundreds of employees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm laboratory, including hurricane hunters and researchers.

Nearly half of the National Weather Service (NWS)'s forecasting offices have been left critically understaffed, with around a quarter lacking a meteorologist-in-charge.

On the ground, there are about 20% fewer permanent FEMA staff responsible for responding to hurricanes and other disasters. Emergency training for those who remained on the job was also rolled back.

Sarah Galvez, Climate Power's senior adviser for climate urgency, says that communities in the path of Hurricane Erin “are being put at risk thanks to the Trump Administration gutting the forecasting that people rely on during extreme weather.”

Since 1980, as the planet has warmed, the number of significant hurricanes (classified as Category 3 or greater) has doubled. In recent years, they have also begun to intensify more rapidly as they approach landfall, giving forecasters less time to catch them and residents less time to respond.

But as part of a multi-pronged assault on climate science, Trump has also made it harder to track these and other disasters. In May, NOAA announced that it would no longer track the number of disasters resulting in over $1 billion in damage.

“Fueled by the climate crisis,” Galvez says, “major hurricanes are only becoming more frequent and severe, but Trump's reckless actions have left Americans vulnerable and unprepared.”

On Tuesday, Reps. Greg Casar (D-Texas) and Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) introduced legislation aimed at rolling back Trump's cuts to these agencies.

Hurricane Erin is hitting the East Coast right now.Earlier this year, Trump slashed funding for FEMA and NOAA — the agencies that keep us safe before and after disasters. My new bill would reverse Trump's cuts and restore crucial resources for families across the country.

“As we continue to face increasing numbers of natural disasters across our country — wildfires, floods, hurricanes — it's critically important that we equip our communities with the resources they need,” Neguse said. “Whether it's the preparedness programs run by NOAA and NWS, or the response and recovery initiatives managed by FEMA, our federal agencies play a crucial role in addressing the increasing frequency of disasters.”

A court ruled with SpaceX and two other companies on Tuesday in their case arguing that the structure of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is unconstitutional, in a decision that could have seismic implications for workers' rights for years to come.

In its ruling, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit said that safeguards for NLRB board members and administrative law judges for the NLRB are unconstitutional. The NLRB board makes key determinations on federal labor law, and administrative law judges adjudicate cases regarding unfair labor practices.

The ruling suspends unfair labor practice proceedings against Elon Musk's SpaceX and co-plaintiffs Energy Transfer and Findhelp. Donald Trump appointee Judge Don Willett wrote in his decision for the court that it constitutes irreparable harm for the companies to be subject to such cases “[w]hen an agency's structure violates the separation of powers.”

The NLRB will likely appeal the decision. The Fifth Circuit is notoriously right wing, and has spent years publishing extremist right-wing decisions that have pushed issues like abortion rights and affirmative action before the Supreme Court.

The decision is a major blow to workers' rights at a time when the Trump administration is conducting a major overhaul of union and worker protections, including moves to gut the NLRB; and shortly after the major unionization wave in recent years that saw both a rise in union filings and a rise in unfair labor practice filings. 

“The decision seems to guarantee that companies in the Fifth Circuit — which covers Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi — can get district courts to block unfair labor practice cases by filing constitutional lawsuits against the agency,” wrote Bloomberg Law reporter Robert Iafolla. 

SpaceX has faced numerous accusations of unfair labor practices, including a complaint last year from the NLRB alleging that the company illegally fired eight employees who signed a letter criticizing a sexist environment within the company.

The Fifth Circuit's decision has been criticized by labor advocates, who say that it gives employers enormous power over workers.

“This is what oligarchy looks like: Today, 2 Trump judges ruled that the NLRB's structure is unconstitutional giving Elon Musk, worth $410 billion, and other union busters the absolute power to exploit workers and violate labor law with impunity,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) on social media on Wednesday.

“This disastrous decision cannot stand,” Sanders went on.

During his second term, Donald Trump has railed against the United States' closest allies. He has imposed tariffs, threatened to upend security commitments, and openly challenged the borders of Canada, Panama, and Greenland.

Historians often look to the past for insight about the present and future. But although alliances have collapsed for many reasons over past centuries, Margaret MacMillan argues in a recent essay for Foreign Affairs that Trump's current behavior toward allies has little precedent. His approach, she writes, “does not suggest a clever Machiavellian policy to enhance American power; rather, it shows a United States acting against its own interests in bewildering fashion, undermining one of the key sources of that power.”

A renowned historian and professor emeritus of international history at Oxford University, MacMillan is one of the greatest chroniclers of the grand alliances of the twentieth century and the world wars they fought. She joined Editor-at-Large Hugh Eakin on August 18 to discuss the normalization of conquest and the war in Ukraine, how U.S. allies are calculating their next steps, and what the United States' approach to its alliances will mean for the future.

Margaret, it's been wonderful to have your series of pieces over the last couple years bringing historical perspective on tectonic events happening. I should say we're recording on Monday morning, August 18, and some of the events we discussed may even evolve in the coming hours and days.

I want to get right away to your most recent article about alliances and how they end. But before we do so, I thought we might start with what has happened this weekend: Alaska. Here we have a U.S. president welcoming a Russian adversary on the red carpet, and now today, as we speak, European allies rushing to Washington to try to pick up the pieces. How should we think about this?

I think it's a question we're all struggling with. Very little has come out about what was actually said, although there have been rumors and some leaks, I think. But it was a very strange occasion. It's unlike, I think, most summits I've ever been able to think of. It was not prepared. It happened at very short notice, and usually summits take a great deal of preparation. They take experts, they bring along people who really know the subjects. And this seems to have had a very ad hoc flavor to it.

And the optics were really, I think, striking. I mean, [U.S. President Donald Trump] greeted [Russian President Vladimir Putin] as a long lost friend. Aircraft flew overhead. He shook his hand several times, he took him off in the car. That is an extraordinary way to greet someone who started a war unprovoked in Ukraine. And then the press conference at the end, I found very weird. The meeting didn't go as long as it was scheduled for. There was very little at the press conference that was said about the meeting. And President Putin spoke first, which is unusual—normally the president of the United States would be in charge of the meeting. And Putin spoke for much longer than President Trump was going to speak for.

So what does it all mean? It's very, very difficult to understand. I mean, I have a very nasty feeling that this is going to turn out like Munich in 1938 and result in the betrayal of Ukraine. But we won't know, I suppose, until after meetings have taken place. There'll be subsequent meetings in Washington and perhaps elsewhere. So the outlines will emerge, I think, fairly slowly.

And a key point here was, coming into this summit, we had the U.S. president saying, “We have to have a ceasefire,” and this was the sort of starting point. And we have emerged, at least at this point, in which that position has been entirely given up. And there's a call for what Putin has said, “Let's have a comprehensive agreement,” which could be months and months of negotiation, buying Russia the time that it wants. How does this compare to 1938? What was it that happened at Munich that we sort of have this idea in our head of appeasement?

What happened at Munich was an attempt—and I don't think it was a dishonorable attempt—by the British prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, with support from a lot of his own cabinet and the British public, and also support in France, to avoid another catastrophic war in Europe. I mean, these were people who had come through the First World War. They'd seen what it had cost Europe. Many of them had lost family members. Some of them had actually been injured in the fighting. So they knew what war was like, and they were doing their best to avoid it. And unfairly or not, they were prepared to sacrifice a part of Czechoslovakia.

What Chamberlain thought he had got was appeasing the appetites of the German dictator, Adolf Hitler. And he came back to London bearing this infamous bit of paper in which the British and the Germans pledged never to go to war with each other again. And of course he didn't get it. But what he was also doing, to be fair to him, was upping British defenses. He didn't trust Hitler. He thought this was the last chance to try and make peace. But he was understanding that he was dealing with someone who was untrustworthy. And that of course turned out immediately to be the case in 1939, when Hitler, in spite of his promises, annexed what was left of Czechoslovakia. So I think it was a meeting in which a lot was given away, but it was I think more of a careful meeting and a worry about what would happen next and preparations being made for that.

A more direct parallel, it seems also is a question of territory, and the indication or intimation from the United States that it's prepared to have Ukraine give up territory in the supposed interest that this will resolve the conflict. And give up territory that it has fought valiantly for for more than three years and which Russia has been unable to conquer on the battlefield, which may seem astonishing. Is there a history there that we should be concerned about?

I think we should be very concerned. And in fact, the Czechoslovak example in 1938 is a good one, because what Czechoslovakia gave up when it gave up the Sudetenland, which was in the western part of the country, was extremely well-prepared defences against a possible German attack and a great deal of its very efficient arms industry.

And if Ukraine gives up the territory that Russia's demanding—some of which Russia is not even occupying—it's also giving up well-prepared defensive positions. And it's giving up territory, which has, pre-war, included a lot of Ukraine's natural resources and industries. And what strikes me about what the American position seems to be, as it's emerging, is that it's really accepting the Russian interpretation of the war and prepared to go a long way to meet Russian demands, and seeing Ukraine as something of an obstacle in the road to some sort of peace.

And President Trump a while ago was saying that he was fed up with Russia, and he was going to put sanctions on, and that talk seems to have disappeared. And he seems to be accepting, and his administration seems to be accepting the idea that somehow the war just started or that somehow it was Ukraine's fault, when it was an open act of aggression by Russia against Ukraine. And even this talk of land swaps—there's nothing to swap. What Putin has done is take land that belongs to Ukraine. He's violated internationally recognized borders. So there's no swap here. What it would be is simply confirming conquest by one power over another power and seizing that power's land, which is a very, very dangerous precedent for the rest of the world.

I think this brings us directly to your wonderful piece from about a month ago, “Making America Alone Again,” in which you were exploring the sort of astonishing reversal of a way of dealing with allies and the Western alliance that has endured for 80 years. I would love to understand the current events in light of your analysis. And it seems that not only the Russia summit, but we have a spat with India—another ally that five administrations have cultivated assiduously—now being trashed with higher tariffs, I believe, than China, which was the original source of the supposed reason for having a tariff war. How do we read this new era in which allies are treated in this way, and what are the implications?

It's not difficult to work out where it's coming from, but to understand it, I find difficult. I mean, part of it, I think, is an impulse to reassert American power and make the United States central in the world, the dominant power in the world, on which all other powers have to depend or all other powers, including China, have to deal. It's part of the “make America great again.” I think there's a strand, also, of American isolationism in there: “We don't need other nations. We can pick and choose who we deal with. We won't be obliged to deal with anyone.”

But I think also, and this is what makes it particularly confusing, I think a lot of it depends on the preferences and whims and changeable attitudes of one man, and that is the president. The whole sudden switch about India is extraordinary because the United States, as you pointed out, has spent at least 20 years trying to gradually detach India from its friendship with Russia, and suddenly they're casting it back into Russia's arms. The Indians have just announced that they're going to be trading with Russia more, getting more Russian oil. And this is presumably not a result that a lot of Americans, even the MAGA Americans or the isolationist Americans, would want.

And I speak as a Canadian, we are absolutely dumbfounded. I mean we have been a very reliable ally. Of course we've had our differences; allies do have their differences because they have different national interests. But we've been very reliable. We've fought with the United States in a number of wars. We joined the coalition in Afghanistan, for example. We fought in Korea. We have been, I think, a loyal ally, and we're absolutely bewildered by this. Why alienate us when you're already getting from us what you need? And we would of course negotiate on tariffs because we have to, but you're getting our raw materials, you're getting access to our water.

And so it's really extraordinary. I mean, I have not been able to think—and I've consulted all my fellow historians who I've talked to—about another example where a power gets rid of dependable allies so cavalierly. And we all do—we get rid of people we don't trust anymore. We no longer count them as allies. But to get rid of ones that you can trust seems to me really damaging to the United States. I mean, it's going to need friends. It still is a great power—perhaps not as great as it once was, and not as dominant as it once was, but it's going to need friends. It's going to need other countries to work with. And it seems to be making it more and more difficult for that to happen.

The history here is so interesting, and this was sort of the starting point of your piece, that there weren't historical examples that could sort of make sense of these current moves by the United States. And it really asks one to look more closely about how alliances are formed and what is their purpose and why do they endure? And many of these lessons appear to be ignored right now. But just walk us briefly through some of the historic examples which show alliances have broken over time when they no longer serve a purpose.

Alliances, I think—I mean, if you think of it in terms of human relationships, they're rather like any human relationship, like a friendship or like a business partnership. They rely on a certain amount of trust. They rely on a certain amount of melding of objectives, even though each party will have different long-term interests. But they can be sometimes brought together, and countries and individuals can work together even if they have differences over where their interests lie.

I mean alliances, I think, in the past and in the present come together often to provide common defense against an enemy. I mean, it's not always about war. Alliances come together for other purposes. They come together to try and prevent wars from happening. They come together to try and keep control over a troublesome nation that is threatening everyone. And so you get different sorts of alliances, but the most common, I think, in history has been a defensive alliance against a threatened enemy. And if and when that enemy is defeated, then the alliance does sometimes fall to pieces, but not always.

I mean when there's been a very great conflict, I think people in an alliance do begin to worry about what next. They don't want another conflict like this. I mean, after the Napoleonic Wars, the Grand Alliance that defeated Napoleon gradually transformed into the Congress of Europe, which tried to smother revolution—you can disagree or not with that—tried to deal with issues that could have caused war because they had just come through a war, and they didn't want to have another one. And the same thing happened after the First World War, when the victorious Allies tried to set up a new international order, set up the League of Nations, with the hope that it would prevent conflict like the war that had just come through.

And so alliances can exist to project into the future the vision of a world that you might want, and they can exist sometimes to try and prevent the causes of a conflict. And so they are, I think, very important. And yes, they do fall to pieces. And there'll always be differences, and there'll always be tensions. And even Canada and the United States, or the United States and Britain, which have been very close allies, have had their moments. But the alliance has lasted. And probably, I mean, I always think, it's like again, another human relationship, like a marriage for example, or a partnership. You have to work at it. You can't just say, “Now we've got an alliance and we can relax. It's all going to be okay.” You keep working at it. You keep trying to understand each other. You keep building those links, which are so important.

And you have some great examples of this. And one could imagine a world that didn't have [British Prime Minister Winston Churchill] and [U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt], but two other leaders, that alliance might not have worked so well. The United States was very isolationist coming into the war, and it took a lot of effort to bring all of that about. And these human relations are maybe part of the kind of question around the current moment where we don't see a lot of that between the current U.S. president and the core allies in Europe or Canada or Mexico, or for that matter, the Asian allies.

Yeah, I think human relations can be very important. I mean, sometimes I think alliances depend too much on human relations, because you'd like to think the alliance is strong enough that it will be carried forward by all sorts of people and by mutual respect between countries. But they can be extremely important. And I think Winston Churchill's—who was the prime minister of Britain from 1940 onwards—relationship with Franklin Roosevelt, who of course was the president for so much of that period, that relationship was critical. And the two of them managed to deal with issues that came up between them because they trusted each other. I mean, often there were big disagreements over which theater of war they should deal with first. Should they deal more with Japan and defeat it first, or should they defeat Germany first? How should they deal with both those countries? What should the strategies be? How should they deal with the war at sea? All of these things. How should they deal with Joseph Stalin who became a new ally to them when Germany invaded Russia in 1941?

And so that personal relationship, I think, was very important. The two men corresponded a lot. They talked to each other. Churchill laid himself out, as he said, to woo the American president, he said, like a suitor. And he did. He understood just how important it was. And Roosevelt responded to it. He always played his cards very close to his chest, but I think he did establish a relationship with Churchill, and I think it was a very important relationship.

And we can think of so many of those pairings throughout the late twentieth century, and [U.S. National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger] and [Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai or [British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher] and [U.S. President Ronald Reagan]. And here in our current moment, I think of an interview that President Trump gave to the BBC, I think a month ago, in which he said, “I trust almost [nobody].” Which I think was a quite candid comment of where he sits in these relations.

Is this part of the essence of alliances that we are losing now, that there is this breakdown in trust? And you do see the European allies making this effort to establish some kind of rapport, or Mark Rutte, the head of NATO, or your Canadian prime minister. So we have these efforts on one side. But can an alliance work where it's not mutual?

It's very hard, I think. And it's not just the leaders who count—it's the people who work in state departments, foreign offices. It's the business people who work with each other. I mean, I've been talking to a lot of Canadians, and we've always, for obvious reasons, laid ourselves out to get on well with the United States. We have to. You're much bigger and more powerful than us, and you are right there on our borders.

And I think there's a feeling that in Washington, with what's been happening in the State Department or the National Security Council and elsewhere, those who understood Canada and had relationships with Canadian diplomats and Canadian business people, have been fired or have been marginalized. And I think that is going to be costly. Perhaps more to Canada than to the United States. But if any relationship is going to work, you need to understand what it is that motivates the other. And it's not always just naked self-interest. I mean, I think too many around President Trump, and I think the president himself, seem to think that everyone is motivated by economic gain. It's all a business deal. And that really doesn't get at what motivates people in many cases. I mean, I don't think President [Volodymyr] Zelensky of Ukraine is motivated by looking for a good business deal. He's motivated, as many Ukrainians are, by a desire to save their country. And that's very different.

And I think without that knowledge and understanding, which you can't develop quickly—it develops over the years—it makes it much more difficult to have good relations. I mean, even simple understandings; I mean, when the British and Americans first started having to really deal with each other in the Second World War, the Americans felt the British were being snobs and looking down on them. And the British probably were snobs, but also felt the Americans wouldn't listen to advice. I mean, these things caused tensions. And they were gradually worked out, and they got to know each other. But you can't just do it overnight.

There's such an interesting example here with Canada itself, and I thought maybe you could talk about this. There was a survey this summer that had this astonishing finding that I think close to 60 percent of Canadians now view the United States both as the most important ally and the country they fear most. And this kind of paradox I believe is also true now in Mexico in the same survey. And one can imagine the Danes coming to the same conclusion, and perhaps Germany and the United Kingdom as well, certainly in terms of how the United States is dealing with Ukraine. What happens when the leader of an alliance—of course the United States being the dominant power, not just building these alliances, but really running them through the postwar era—what happens when that leader becomes an antagonist within the alliance?

Hugh, that's what we're all asking ourselves. The feeling in Ottawa, I've heard from people, our capital city, is one of complete shock. That everything we had based our foreign policy on, all the assumptions we've been making, has suddenly gone away. It's ground shifting under our feet. And I think we're really bewildered by it. I mean, I think there's a lot of thinking going on, and there's certainly a lot of discussion. But where do we go and what do we do?

And I think what gets us particularly nervous is the unpredictability. And again, I think it comes from the president, but there are others, again, around him. And then we don't know who he's taking advice from. Is he taking advice from Laura Loomer? Is she suddenly deciding that Canada is something she doesn't like? We just don't know. It's very hard to make policy when you don't have any surety that agreements are going to be kept. You don't know where things are going to happen.

I mean, we've been doing trade negotiations with the United States for many years. And over the years, we've developed great respect for American trade negotiators because they've known their briefs, as we have. And now it's not clear who's in charge and who's doing the negotiating, and how much they actually know about the issues. And so I think we do see the United States as an ally, but we also see it as one that, increasingly, we just don't know where it's going. And that's a very uncomfortable position for us, certainly. Maybe not for the United States, but it certainly is for us.

You have this wonderful line in your piece, I think you said, “Canada has never been a threat to the United States, except in hockey.” And there is a sense that, where does this animosity come from? But we see that over and over again with other allies. And here, I think, comes back to your point that alliances are built on more than just a particular strategic goal—that the ones that endure have something else. And here the paradox is, the Western alliance is one of the most successful in history in this regard. That there was more to it than just power. There was this ideal of Western democracy—values, we might say. And I wonder, are we in an era now where this idea of values is really declining, that there isn't a shared, at least obvious shared system of values that are governing the current decision-making or direction in which the United States seems to be leading its interests?

It's very hard, I think, at the moment for those of us who are outside the United States to know what it is that the United States wants the world to be like. From various statements that are made, it seems to be that the administration is thinking in terms of a new world of spheres of influence, where three or four dominant powers dominate their own surroundings, and somehow, goodness knows how, deal with each other in a way that doesn't lead to war. But it's not, I think, a formula for a very stable international order. Spheres of influence have always in history tended to lead to clashes. And the spheres of influence are going to have different interests, and they're going to compete to gain in the borderlands, the shatter zones, as historians often call them. In the borderlands, they're going to try and establish dominance or protect themselves. And there will always be the uncommitted countries who may swing between one or the other, or be wooed by one or the other, which will also lead to instability.

But it's very hard to see any sort of coherent vision. I mean, there's a series of statements. You get tweets; they don't really explain what the policy is. I mean, you only have so many characters, and they seem to be more statements or headlines than substantive explanations. And so I'm not sure. And I don't know how sure you in the United States are about what the United States' vision of the world actually is. As I say, it seems to be some sort of spheres of influence and dominance by great powers. If so, I think that is potentially a very dangerous way of dividing the world up.

Another perhaps different historic strand to this that you also pointed out in your piece is that the United States does have a particular history in coming late to the world of alliances and European diplomacy. And because of its geography, was able to survive much longer into the modern era as, you might say, isolated power. And that belated emergence, I wonder if that plays into this strand of American thinking that continues today to be isolationist, skeptical of entanglements. Do you see that as part of the dynamic now?

Yeah, I mean, I think that countries, much like individuals, have memories. And we have visions of ourselves and we have ideas about where we came from. Maybe not always very coherent ones, but we do. And I think the United States has a very strong isolationist strand. I mean, you go back to the famous warning of George Washington against entangling alliances. And the fact that the United States was born in an act of rebellion against a European power and a suspicion which was there, and I think continued to be there, of Europe and its machinations and its attempts to get back the rebellious colonies. I think that has shaped American attitudes toward the world.

The growth of U.S. power has made it possible for the United States to need the world less than other countries might. And I think you also have geography—that Canada on the whole has never been a threat. I mean, the United States has been a threat to us; we remember a few invasion attempts from the United States. But we have never really threatened to invade the United States. Mexico has not been a threat, not really, to the United States. And those two huge oceans have kept the United States safe. And so I think geography plus history have played a part. It's not the only strand in American thinking, but it's certainly a very important part.

But the development of technology, the changes in armaments, the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles are now increasingly fast—subsonic and supersonic missiles, the use of space—means that the relative isolation of the United States is much less than it was. And that while the United States, or the people in the United States, may prefer to disregard and ignore the rest of the world, the rest of the world is not going to disregard and ignore them. And I do think that's something that in the future is going to matter more and more to the United States.

And the more important parallel here might be the British Empire in the nineteenth century, which as you described, discovered the vulnerability of not having strong alliances. Can you just tell us a little bit about that?

There's a very good phrase that Paul Kennedy, the international historian at Yale University, uses, and that's “imperial overstretch.” You build a great big empire, but that means you have a lot more to defend, and you have to spend a lot linking it up. You have to look after the supply routes, in the case of the British Empire, largely by sea, although later on air became important.

And the United States with its worldwide commitments, I think, is feeling something of that burden, that overstretch. And understandably, I think, a lot of Americans are saying, why are we doing all this? Why do we have troops stationed in South Korea? Why do we have troops in Germany? Why do we have all these bases around the world? Why are we propping up these countries and giving them assistance and so on? And I do think that empires reach a point where the burden begins to be too much, whether it's a psychological burden, people at home just don't want an empire and they don't want their children dying in its defense, and the financial burden that it gets to be, or it can be, very expensive. Empires are not always profitable. And what the British were finding was that they had huge responsibilities, and that they had stirred up resentment and opposition, and that a great deal of the world didn't like them and wasn't prepared to cooperate with them. They reacted by, in fact, building alliances and settling differences with some of their most prominent rivals.

At the moment, the United States doesn't seem to be doing that, although I think President Trump hopes for some sort of relationship with China and seems to have some sort of relationship with Russia. So possibly what the United States will do is begin to try and look for allies to take some of the burden away from managing this very large global—it is in some ways an empire—but these very large global interests it has. And from the sound of it he would like, and those again, advising him, some of them would like to withdraw U.S. involvement. Some have talked about getting out of NATO, bringing the troops back from South Korea. So I think it's going to be a very interesting period in U.S. foreign policy, and in fact in international relations, because it's not at all clear how this is going to play out. I mean, we're living in a time of great uncertainty and a time of transition, but we're not sure toward what.

I wanted to ask you about your previous piece, which was a longer essay you did in the magazine right after the U.S. election. And this was of course before we had seen any of the second Trump administration, so you were raising a series of questions. And one of them, given all the focus at the time on the Trump administration was, well, how will the order react? Will it withstand all sorts of new pressures? And I think as you put it, a more important question may be how well American democracy and the international order can withstand the stress. And I can't help but wonder how, now seven months into the new administration, you assess that test has gone.

It's always hard when you're in the middle of events, but I think I'm echoing a fairly common view that there has been much more change and more radical change both within the United States and in its relationship with the world than we had expected. And we knew, I think, that if Donald Trump was elected to be president for a second term, that he would bring about change, that he would try and do some of the things that he felt he hadn't been able to do in his first term. But I think I speak for a lot of people—I mean you may have foreseen this, I didn't—that it would be quite so quick and quite so radical. And that the federal government itself would've come under such attack and so many of its functions would have been compromised by very rapid change. I mean, if you want to speak to someone on a particular subject, it's not clear you can find them easily. They may have been moved, they may have been fired. There may be someone in the office who doesn't know anything.

And I think the worsening relationships of the United States with its allies, again, has happened more quickly. Speaking as a Canadian, we, I don't think, imagine that we would have an existential threat, which we take seriously. I mean, I don't think if people say, well, it's just a joke when President Trump talks about the 51st state. That's not how we see it. And I think we are very, very concerned. You've probably talked to other Canadians, but it's something we haven't had to face. And I think the Europeans are sharing some of the same concerns and bewilderment. And I guess we're all wondering where next and what if?

That's, I suppose, partly why we go back to history because history doesn't offer clear lessons, it never has done, I think. But what history offers is sort of what ifs. What is likely to happen in circumstances like these? There have been other examples in the past of moments of great transition ,of people saying the old order is dead. And we had it after the Napoleonic Wars. We had it after the First World War. And it is happening. And I think a lot of the international institutions will not survive, or survive in a very much weakened form. And I fear that we're heading into a world where power matters. And if you're a country, you try and get away with whatever you can get away with. And that seems to me a disastrous way of running the world because it will provide, as it is already providing, conflicts which go on and on and on. I mean, we focus perhaps on what's happening in the Middle East and Ukraine at the moment, but there are all those other conflicts which are unresolved and show very little sign of being resolved.

You could say, well, the United States hasn't withdrawn from NATO. It's forced the other members to cough up much more, NATO defense spending by country is higher than it's been ever. The president, for all his bluster, really does want peace deals. He covets the [Nobel] Peace Prize. Maybe something good will come of all this disruption and chaos. Is there a merit to that? Certainly there were issues within the existing order. Things could have been better, NATO members could have spent more on defense, could have been more prepared for an invasion of Europe. Is there another way of looking at this moment of uncertainty?

Well, there is that argument—yes, but, say what you will, President Trump has done this and done that. I agree that NATO was in trouble because its members were not spending enough on defense, apart from the United States. Although a lot of U.S. defense expenditure was on things not connected with NATO—Americans have other interests around the world than just merely NATO. You can say that it is important for NATO to have spent more and that President Trump has pushed them in that direction. But I think it comes with a cost.

I think there were other ways of pushing NATO members to up their defense spending. But what has happened, I think, the way he has done it, and the public way in which he has—I think, unnecessarily in my view, but of course people will disagree with me—unnecessarily alienated long-standing allies has left its mark. And I think a lot of European nations are thinking, and Canada's thinking that, yes, we will remain in NATO. We're going to make other arrangements. We're going to make agreements among ourselves. We have realized that we can no longer count on the United States. And so you can agree with the goal of getting NATO to increase its defense spending, but the way in which it was done, I think, has been needlessly harmful.

As we enter what could perhaps be an era of a post-alliance world, in which the alliance, maybe it continues, but in a less manifestly strong way, so it's just existing the way of the United Nations or other international institutions that have far less power—what would that world look like? And are there other moments in history where you could say, well, there really wasn't a strong order contributing to, whether it's more conflict or other kinds of competition?

There are other examples. I mean, I think the power of example or precedent is very important. So if you have a world order in which, for example, you don't attack your neighbors unprovoked, then if people start attacking their neighbors unprovoked, then others will do it.

To give you one example, before the First World War, this notion of a Congress of Europe where the great powers got together to try and maintain peace and stability and order, which had lasted for most of the nineteenth century, with some exceptions, really broke down just before the First World War, when in, I think it was 1911, Italy, unprovoked, breaking an international understanding, attacked the Ottoman Empire and seized territory in North Africa, which eventually became Libya. And that encouraged Balkan nations, also in 1912 and 1913, to attack the Ottoman Empire and seize territory from it. And so a very important taboo, if you like, was broken. And others were encouraged by this.

And we saw the same thing before the Second World War. Once you got the aggression by Italy, unprovoked attack on Ethiopia; or Japan making an unprovoked attack on China and seizing Manchuria; and then of course Hitler himself seizing Austria and then seizing Czechoslovakia—this all encouraged the dictators to think they would get away with it because the rest of the world complained and said this is not very good, but did in fact very little.

And I think what we're seeing now is the idea—and it was a very strong idea and a very strong taboo, if you like, in international relations since 1945—that a country that seizes land from another country without justification, without any reason—well, they may give reasons but not good reasons—that seizure will not be recognized by other nations. It will not be accepted as legitimate. And that's now been broken. Putin got away with attacking Ukraine in 2014 and took Crimea. And that has more or less been recognized. You could argue it was broken before, when China seized Tibet. But for the most part, since 1945, the idea that seizing territory by force would not be recognized and was illegitimate held. And now it's gone. And I think we will see other nations beginning to do that as well. Why not?

In fact, could you argue that we're already seeing this effect? Of course, we have the talk about the Panama Canal, Greenland, Canada, this was all rhetoric from the administration. But in these last six months, we have Israel in the Golan Heights, Rwanda has entered eastern Congo. There's been a border dispute in Thailand and Cambodia. It's hard to say how much these are connected, but it does seem that there is a new understanding of—I mean, Ethiopia has made claims about having a seaport again on the Red Sea. Do you actually see this issue of sovereign boundaries, this taboo as you call it, sort of already eroding?

Absolutely, absolutely. There's been a lot of public rhetoric about this. I mean, President Trump, again, has said that the border between Canada and the United States is artificial. “It was drawn badly. We should rectify that.” And I do think we are seeing the emboldening of those who want to use military force to get what they want. And they're not going to pay a penalty. I mean, Russia—well, yes, there have been sanctions, and the rich Russians haven't been able to buy some of the luxury goods that they want, although they've, I think, found ways around that. But I don't think Russia has really been slapped with serious sanctions. Its tankers, sailing under false flags, are still shipping oil around the world. And I think others will think that the international order is toothless, and increasingly it is.

And if you're [Chinese leader Xi Jinping], do you think that all of this provides more of an opportunity for China? Do you see the Taiwan question becoming more acute in this era of declining understandings and rules?

Look, China has already been pushing quite aggressively in the seas around Taiwan and in the South China Sea. It's apparently ordered an American warship out of those waters, even though they're international waters, just fairly recently. And there has been talk, and Xi Jinping has made it clear that he sees “reuniting,” as he puts it, Taiwan with the rest of China, as his legacy.

It's always a dangerous moment, I think, when leaders begin to get a bit old because they start thinking of history, and they start thinking of how they're going to be recorded. And this is, I think, on the whole not a good thing. And I think as far as we can tell from Xi Jinping's public remarks, he really wants to get the Taiwan issue settled and is prepared to use military force. I mean, China has been making a great deal of military preparations, including building landing craft and including practicing seaborne landings, which would of course be necessary if they're going to seize Taiwan.

And so yes, I think we are in a period where China is asserting its relevance, its muscle, it's asserting its claims. And I think as far as China's concerned, the disarray in the Western alliance and the disarray among U.S. allies and the United States, and U.S. allies in the Pacific is, from its point of view, a very good thing. When the United States falls out with Vietnam, for example, or falls out with India, which is a rival to China—this only, I think, is good for China.

The idea about leaders and their place in history—it's interesting to think also now, you do see this in the second Trump administration: more thinking about history, how the story of the United States should be told. We see this as a pattern among strong leaders or autocratic leaders in other countries. Putin, of course, this was the beginning of the Ukraine war, his historic manifesto about greater Russia. Xi Jinping, as you have just said.

Is this something that has always happened in history, that powerful leaders will want to shape, not just the present but the past? Or are we in a kind of new moment of historical rewriting? One might never have expected this from a democratic country. And I'm just curious how you would read that.

History has so often been used in the past. I mean, we know that it was used in the Classical world, it was used in the Middle Ages. But in the past, I think there were also other sources of authority. History did not, I think, in the past have quite the dominant authority, which it seems to have now in justifying what nations are doing. In the past, people would use religion more, for example. When the Crusades were launched, the grounds for those were religious, to recover the holy places in the holy land. Or simply dynastic claims were very important.

But I think as other sources of authority, I mean, have fallen away—I think religion is no longer, except by some fanatical religious groups, used as a justification for waging war—history has come to take its place. And for some reason, we seem to think of history as this gray-bearded, probably gentleman, sitting there saying, “You're right, you're wrong.” When people say, “History will judge,” that seems to me a very dangerous idea. History is not a judge. History is a record of the past which we try and understand. And when people say, “I want to be on the right side of history”—there isn't a right side and a wrong side. There's right and wrong, but not a right history and a wrong history in that sense.

And so I think history is being used more and more as justification. And I think we see this with the Trump administration, that they're calling on an American past, which is a very one-sided version of the American past. They're using it partly to attack their domestic enemies. They're saying there's been far too much wokeness in the history and far too much concentrating on the dark side of American history. “We want to elevate American history, want to make it glorious again.” But I think it's also used as justification for the way in which the United States deals with the rest of the world.

And you're right, I mean, Putin used history to justify his claims to Ukraine. I mean, I read that manifesto he wrote, which I think by all accounts, he wrote himself and took very seriously. And I'm a teacher, I've been a teacher all my life, and I try to encourage students. So if I'd been grading it, I would've said, you've done a lot of work, but you haven't really used the evidence and your analysis is pretty bad. I mean, it's a bad essay. And the arguments are tendentious. And he keeps making them. You know, that the Ukrainians—he did it in the press conference recently in Alaska—“Ukrainians are our brothers.” Well, tell that to the Ukrainians. They don't see it that way. So I think history is becoming justification more and more because we have fewer other sorts of justification.

Margaret, this has been a wonderful conversation. I can't wait for your next essay. I'm sure this story, as so many in history, will have another very unexpected chapter.

Thank you, Hugh. And I'm sure two days from now we'll be looking at things and saying it's all completely different now.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department said Thursday that it's reviewing the records of more than 55 million foreigners who hold valid U.S. visas for potential revocation or deportable violations of immigration rules.

In a written answer to a question posed by The Associated Press, the department said that all U.S. visa holders are subject to “continuous vetting” with an eye toward any indication that they could be ineligible for the document. 

Should such information be found, the visa will be revoked and, if the visa holder is in the United States, he or she would be subject to deportation. 

The department said it was looking for indicators of ineligibility, including visa overstays, criminal activity, threats to public safety, engaging in any form of terrorist activity, or providing support to a terrorist organization.

“We review all available information as part of our vetting, including law enforcement or immigration records or any other information that comes to light after visa issuance indicating a potential ineligibility,” the department said.

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has thus far focused on deporting migrants illegally in the United States as well as holders of student and visitor exchange visas. The State Department's new language suggests that the re-vetting process, which officials acknowledge is time-consuming, is far more widespread.

The administration has steadily imposed more and more restrictions and requirements on visa applicants, including requiring all visa seekers to submit to in-person interviews. 




But the review of all visa holders appears to be a significant expansion of what had initially been a re-vetting process focused mainly on students who have been involved in pro-Palestinian or anti-Israel activity.

Officials say the reviews will include all the visa holders' social media accounts, law enforcement and immigration records in their home countries, along with any actionable violations of U.S. law committed while they were in the United States.

“As part of the Trump Administration's commitment to protect U.S. national security and public safety, since Inauguration Day the State Department has revoked more than twice as many visas, including nearly four times as many student visas, as during the same time period last year,” the department said.

Earlier this week, the department said that since Trump returned to the White House, it has revoked more than 6,000 student visas for overstays and violations of local, state and federal law, the vast majority of which were assault, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and support for terrorism.

It said that about 4,000 of those 6,000 were due to actual infractions of laws and that approximately 200–300 visas were revoked for terrorism-related issues, including providing support for designated terrorist organizations or state sponsors of terrorism.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Millie Bobby Brown and Jake Bongiovi adopted a daughter, the first child for the married couple, this summer, they announced Thursday. 

“We are beyond excited to embark on this beautiful next chapter of parenthood in both peace and privacy,” the couple wrote in a social media statement. No further details were released.

Brown, 21, and Bongiovi, 23, were married in a private ceremony in May 2024. Representatives for Brown and Bongiovi did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for comment. 

Brown gained recognition for her starring role as Eleven in the Duffer brothers' sci-fi series “Stranger Things.” The fifth and final season will air this November and December, a culmination of nine years of the show's production. The British actor has pursued other acting and business ventures in that time, including the Netflix original “Enola Holmes” films and a “Godzilla” film. She even released a romance book in 2023. 

Bongiovi is the son of Jon Bon Jovi, founder and frontman of the rock band Bon Jovi. Bongiovi debuted his own acting career as the star in “Rockbottom,” which released last year. 

Brown stressed the importance of family during the 2024 premiere of her Netflix film “Damsel,” where Bongiovi and his parents were in attendance.

“I'm just so lucky that they're here tonight and it just means so much to me,” Brown told The Associated Press then. “Family is everything and just to have my second family here means everything.”

The couple lives in Georgia. She recently told the AP she enjoys living on a farm, largely disconnected from social media, while promoting her 2025 Netflix film “The Electric State.”

At the end of work trips, Nathan Miller goes home to a makeshift bedroom in his parents' house in Virginia. The 29-year-old flight attendant is part of a PSA Airlines crew based in Philadelphia, but Miller says he can't afford to live there.

He makes about $24,000 a year working full-time for the American Airlines subsidiary. Despite often staffing multiple flights a day, Miller commutes by plane between Virginia Beach and Philadelphia International Airport, a distance of about 215 miles.

“I've considered finding a whole new job. It's not something that I want to do,” Miller, who joined PSA two years ago, said. “But it's not sustainable.”

His situation isn't unique. Frustrations among flight attendants at both regional and legacy airlines have been building for years over paychecks that many of them say don't match the weight of what their jobs demand. Compounding the discontent over hourly wages is a long-standing airline practice of not paying attendants for the work they perform on the ground, like getting passengers on and off planes.

Air Canada's flight attendants put a public spotlight on these simmering issues when about 10,000 of them walked off the job last weekend, forcing the airline to cancel more than 3,000 flights. The strike ended Tuesday with a tentative deal that includes wage increases and, for the first time, pay for boarding passengers.

In the United States, however, the nearly century-old Railway Labor Act makes it far more difficult for union flight attendants like Miller, a member of the Association of Flight Attendants, to strike than most other American workers. Unlike the Boeing factory workers and Hollywood writers and actors who collectively stopped work in recent years, U.S. airline workers can only strike if federal mediators declare an impasse — and even then, the president or Congress can intervene.




For that reason, airline strikes are exceedingly rare. The last major one in the U.S. was over a decade ago by Spirit Airlines pilots, and most attempts since then have failed. American Airlines flight attendants tried in 2023 but were blocked by mediators.

Without the ultimate bargaining chip, airline labor unions have seen their power eroded in contract talks that now stretch far beyond historical norms, according to Sara Nelson, the international president of the AFA. Negotiations that once took between a year and 18 months now drag on for three years, sometimes more.

“The right to strike is fundamental to collective bargaining, but it has been chipped away,” Nelson said. Her union represents 50,000 attendants, including the ones at United Airlines, Alaska Airlines and PSA Airlines. 

On Monday, she joined PSA flight attendants in protest outside Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, near where an airliner operated by PSA crashed into the Potomac River in January after colliding with an Army helicopter. All 67 people on the two aircraft were killed, including the plane's pilot, co-pilot and two flight attendants.

The airline's flight attendants also demonstrated outside three other U.S. airports. In a statement, PSA called the demonstrations “one of the important ways flight attendants express their desire to get a deal done — and we share the same goal.”

Flight attendants say their jobs have become more demanding in recent years. Planes are fuller, and faster turnaround times between flights are expected. Customers may see them mostly as uniforms that serve food and beverages, but the many hats attendants juggle include handling in-flight emergencies, deescalating conflicts and managing unruly passengers. 

“We have to know how to put out a lithium battery fire while at 30,000 feet, or perform CPR on a passenger who's had a heart attack. We're trained to evacuate a plane in 90 seconds, and we're always the last ones off,” said Becky Black, a PSA flight attendant in Dayton, Ohio, who is part of the union's negotiating team.

And yet, Black says, their pay hasn't kept pace.

PSA flight attendants have been bargaining for over two years for better wages and boarding pay. Alaska flight attendants spent just as long in talks before reaching a deal in February. At American, flight attendants began negotiations on a new contract in 2020 but didn't get one until 2024.

Southwest Airlines attendants pushed even longer — over five years — before securing a new deal last year that delivered an immediate 22% wage hike and annual 3% increases through 2027.

“It was a great relief,” Alison Head, a longtime Southwest flight attendant based in Atlanta, said. “Coming out of COVID, where you saw prices were high and individuals struggling, it really meant something.”

The contract didn't include boarding pay but secured the industry's first paid maternity and parental leave, a historic win for the largely female workforce. A mother of two, Head said she returned to work “fairly quickly” after having her first child because she couldn't afford to stay home.

“Now, new parents don't have to make that same hard decision,” she said. 

Many of her peers at other airlines are still waiting for their new contracts.

At United, attendants rejected a tentative agreement last month, with 71% voting no. The union is now surveying its members to understand why and plans to return to the bargaining table in December.

One major sticking point: boarding pay. While Delta became the first U.S. airline to offer it in 2022 — followed by American and Alaska — many flight attendants still aren't compensated during what they call the busiest part of their shift.

Back in Virginia Beach, Miller is still trying to make it work. On family vacations during his childhood, Miller said he was fascinated by flight attendants and their ability to make people feel comfortable and safe. 

Now he's got his dream job, but he isn't sure he can afford to keep doing it.

Former federal prosecutor Jim Trusty discusses Tulsi Gabbard's referral of Russia probe evidence to the Department of Justice and Alina Habba's ongoing efforts to stay on as Acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey after her interim term expired.

A judge on Thursday found that Alina Habba was unlawfully serving in the role of acting U.S. attorney of New Jersey after President Donald Trump sidestepped typical processes to keep her in charge.

Judge Matthew Brann said Habba has not been the rightful temporary U.S. attorney for New Jersey since July 1, a ruling that follows two criminal defendants in New Jersey challenging her appointment in court, alleging it was unconstitutional.

""Faced with the question of whether Ms. Habba is lawfully performing the functions and duties of the office of the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, I conclude that she is not,"" Brann wrote in a 77-page order.

Habba, Trump's former personal defense lawyer, had been serving as interim U.S. attorney, but when her term expired last month, Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi used loopholes in federal vacancy laws to install her as ""acting"" rather than ""interim"" U.S. attorney.

One of the defendants in the district, Julien Giraud, alleged that the moves violated his constitutional rights because of the string of unconventional actions it took to attempt to keep Habba in the role.

Brann, an Obama appointee serving in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, agreed and found Habba could not prosecute Giraud or another defendant who challenged Habba's position.

Brann is presiding over the matter after the chief judge of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers New Jersey and Pennsylvania, decided the case presented too much of a conflict for New Jersey's federal judges.

The New Jersey judges made the rare decision to decline to extend Habba's term and instead appointed career attorney Desiree Grace to the job. Trump and Bondi fired Grace, withdrew Habba's nomination as permanent U.S. attorney and then reinstated Habba as acting U.S. attorney, which they said kept Habba in charge for at least another 210 days under federal statute.

'Fox & Friends' co-hosts react to Vice President Vance and Sec. Hegseth's confrontation with protesters in Washington, D.C. during a visit with National Guard. 

Twenty Judge Advocate General (JAG) attorneys, part of the legal branch of the U.S. military, have been assigned to prosecute civilian cases in Washington, D.C. as the Trump administration continues its crackdown on crime. 

A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office in the nation's capital confirmed to Fox News Digital that the military lawyers will prosecute misdemeanor crimes. 

""The assignment of 20 JAGs to my office is further proof of President Trump's commitment to fighting and reducing crime in the district,"" U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said in a statement.

HUNDREDS ARRESTED AS TRUMP'S WASHINGTON, DC, CRIME CRACKDOWN HITS FULL STRIDE

President Donald Trump federalized police in D.C. on Aug. 11 as high levels of crime continued to plague the city. 

""I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in Washington, D.C.,"" Trump told reporters when making the announcement. ""And they're going to be allowed to do their job properly.""

There have been no homicides in D.C. since Aug. 13, just two days after the announcement, the Metropolitan Police Department confirmed Thursday morning. 

Approximately 800 National Guard troops have been deployed to the city so far, and federal law enforcement has also swarmed the city to combat crime.

Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Thursday morning that since Trump's initiative began, 630 people have been arrested by federal law enforcement. There were 77 arrests on Wednesday, and 24 of the arrestees were illegal immigrants.

""FBI joined federal partners in 31 more arrests last night,"" Patel said Thursday morning. 

Those arrests included six illegal firearm recoveries, seven drug seizures, and charges including theft, assault with a deadly weapon, drug offenses, assault on an officer and unlawful entry.

 Michelin star chef Joe Isidori breaks down how to get a perfect sear on a steak on ‘Fox & Friends Weekend.'

While the weather remains warm, food trucks across the U.S. are thriving – but a deadly outbreak overseas may give consumers pause.

In Italy, two people recently died in a botulism outbreak linked to a food truck, according to The Telegraph. Fourteen others were hospitalized, all in the Calabria region.

The victims, Luigi di Sarno, 52, and Tamara D'Acunto, 45, passed away after eating sandwiches made of sausage and rapini, also known as turnip greens.

RAW MILK FROM FLORIDA FARM SICKENS 21 PEOPLE, INCLUDING 6 CHILDREN, HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY

Their deaths raise a question for many: Are food trucks riskier than restaurants?

Dr. Michael Policastro told Fox News Digital that botulism is very rare.

""In the U.S., most cases actually come from home-canned goods or improperly preserved foods – not commercial kitchens,"" the Arizona-based doctor said.

""Food trucks work with limited prep space, smaller refrigeration units and intense heat from cooking in tight quarters.""

""I've seen occasional reports from overseas involving street vendors, but here, there's no solid evidence that food trucks are riskier than restaurants.""

That said, Policastro noted that food trucks can pose greater risks if basic safety steps aren't followed.

""Food trucks work with limited prep space, smaller refrigeration units and intense heat from cooking in tight quarters,"" he said. 

""If those factors aren't managed well, the risk [of] any foodborne illness goes up, including botulism.""

A doctor revealed some potential risks that are associated with food trucks. (iStock)

Food trucks also have limited access to water for handwashing compared to brick-and-mortar kitchens, he said.

""Beyond food safety, there are also physical risks – fires, propane issues, even accidents around the truck in crowded areas,"" Policastro said.

He said that botulism typically manifests in home-canned vegetables or meats, along with garlic or vegetables stored in oil.

Other culprits can include baked potatoes wrapped in foil, smoked or fermented fish, certain sausages and cheese sauces, Policastro noted.

Food trucks can lack water for handwashing compared to restaurants, creating another layer of food safety concern, say some medical experts. (iStock)

He added that botulism can be fatal without treatment and typically shows itself 12 to 36 hours after someone consumes contaminated food.

""Early on, people might notice weakness, fatigue, blurred vision or trouble speaking and swallowing,"" Policastro said. 

""Then the muscle weakness can spread from the face and head down to the arms and legs. In severe cases, it reaches the respiratory muscles, and you can't breathe without help. Some people also have nausea, vomiting or abdominal bloating.""

""A little awareness goes a long way in protecting yourself.""

An antitoxin can halt the spread of nerve damage in botulism patients, but immediate hospital care is still essential, as it cannot reverse damage already done, Policastro said.

Jennifer Behm-Lazzarini, a ""Master Chef"" winner and owner of food truck L'Ocean Eats, told Fox News Digital that hygiene starts ""with sanitizing the trailer after every use.""

""[That includes] equipment that is inside the station to the truck and all small wares,"" she said.

Hygiene starts ""with sanitizing the trailer after every use,"" said one food truck owner (not pictured).  (iStock)

Behm-Lazzarini, who travels across the Northeast with her food truck, said that it's crucial to keep serving utensils sanitized and to switch out gloves regularly while touching food.

""Equally important is temperature control, maintaining cold, frozen and hot temperatures of products from the time of procurement to the guests' hands,"" she said.

Policastro stressed that botulism, although rare, is serious.

""Enjoy that taco or sandwich,"" a doctor said, ""but pay attention to how the vendor operates."" (iStock)

""Most cases aren't coming from your local food truck, but any kitchen can make someone sick if safety rules aren't followed,"" Policastro said. 

""If you suddenly develop neurological symptoms like blurred vision, slurred speech or trouble breathing, don't wait. Get emergency help. The faster it's treated, the better the outcome.""

Fox News' Rebekah Castor reports the latest on Ohio, West Virginia and South Carolina deploying National Guard troops to Washington, D.C.

President Donald Trump is scheduled to conduct a patrol with the Metropolitan Police and the National Guard Thursday, following his efforts to federalize the police department and dispatch troops to crack down on crime in Washington. 

""I'm going to be going out tonight with the police and with the military, of course,"" Trump said in an interview Thursday with radio host Todd Starnes. 

NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS FROM SIX RED STATES HEAD TO DC TO HELP TACKLE CRIME

Trump initially mobilized 800 D.C. National Guard troops as part of his effort to reduce crime in Washington Aug. 11. Since then, National Guard troops from Ohio, West Virginia, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee have also been tapped to support the Trump administration's effort. 

Trump's ride along with law enforcement and National Guard troops comes just after Vice President JD Vance visited National Guard troops in Washington's Union Station Wednesday. 

""We are seeing really substantial effects because these guys are busting their a--,"" Vance said Wednesday.

""Right here in Union Station, you have vagrants, you have drug addicts, you have the chronically homeless, you have the mentally ill who harass, who threatened violence, who attacked families,"" Vance said. ""And they've done it for far too long. This should be a monument to American greatness."" 

Under the 1973 Home Rule Act, a temporary federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department is authorized for emergency situations up to 30 days. After that time-frame expires though, Congress must step in and approve any extensions. However, similar restrictions don't exist for D.C. National Guard troops in the Home Rule Act. 

Vance also signaled Wednesday extensions could occur, depending on how much progress is made over the next few weeks.

Meanwhile, Washington officials filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's move to federalize local police Friday.

""By illegally declaring a takeover of MPD, the Administration is abusing its temporary, limited authority under the law,"" Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian Schwalb wrote in a Friday X post. ""This is the gravest threat to Home Rule DC has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it.""Fox News' Patrick Ward contributed to this report.

'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts break down the latest legal clashes over President Donald Trump's deportations of illegal immigrants.

A federal appeals court cleared the way this month for U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to continue to rule on the fate of hundreds of CECOT migrants deported by the Trump administration earlier this year — dissolving an emergency stay it previously handed down, and sending the case back down to the lower court for further consideration.

Members of the appeals court panel — Judges Gregory Katsas, Neomi Rao and Justin Walker — had ruled on the matter earlier this month, but it came into effect for the first time this week.

The ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit formally dissolves the emergency stay it granted to the Trump administration earlier in June, due to what the judges said was a significantly new factual situation at play after CECOT detainees were transferred from El Salvador to Venezuela.

The order also punts the case back to Boasberg for consideration in light of the new circumstances.

Judges stressed in their order that they were not ruling on the lower court order, or the merits of the appeal filed by the Trump administration.

""Under these circumstances, it would make little sense for this court to review a preliminary injunction that, in all likelihood, has been overtaken by events,"" they said.

Rather, they said, the decision was based solely on new developments in the case, after the CECOT migrant class was sent to Venezuela under a diplomatic agreement and prisoner exchange struck with the Maduro regime. 

The three-judge panel said that, in its view, the situation for CECOT plaintiffs had changed in such a way that it would ""alter the appropriateness of injunctive relief"" from the court – a test often used to determine the appropriateness of vacating and remanding a decision to review a case pending on appeal. 

The transfer from CECOT to Venezuela ""alters the harm experienced by plaintiffs,"" judges said, adding that i may affect the government's ability to obtain custody of the migrants in question, though that would be up to the lower courts to ascertain.

""In light of these developments, we find that it is 'just under the circumstances' to vacate the order and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings,"" the court said.

The ruling comes after the U.S. appeals court agreed in June to review the preliminary injunction issued by Judge Boasberg, after he provisionally certified a class of Venezuelan migrants challenging their detention at CECOT, and ordered the Trump administration to ""facilitate"" due process protections for them, including allowing them the opportunity to seek habeas relief and challenge their alleged gang member status, which was used as the basis of their removals under the Alien Enemies Act in March. 

Lawyers for the Trump administration quickly appealed the case to the higher court, which granted the emergency stay.

APPEALS COURT BLOCKS TRUMP ADMIN'S DEPORTATION FLIGHTS IN ALIEN ENEMIES ACT IMMIGRATION SUIT

They said in their ruling this month that the new circumstances at play are likely significant enough to preclude them from weighing in on the case.

While the appeal ""raised serious questions about a court's power to direct the Executive's diplomatic conduct, we do not reach those questions because of a fundamental change in circumstances,"" the court said.

""We express no opinion on what kind of class or relief, if any, may be appropriate in light of the changed circumstances,"" the judges added.

The next steps in the case are unclear. 

Judges on the appeals court noted that the CECOT class plaintiffs would likely need to amend their request for habeas relief, to reflect the updated circumstances. They also allowed for the possibility that some plaintiffs may not wish to press the case further, should it require them to ""submit to the United States' custody.""

Still, the lawsuit is almost certain to continue before Judge Boasberg, who ordered the Justice Department back to court in July to press them for details on the location and custodial status of the CECOT migrants following their removal to Venezuela.

He also ordered both Trump lawyers and plaintiffs to submit regular status updates to his court as he weighs what, if any, opportunities the court has for relief — indicating the matter is not going away any time soon.

During that hearing, ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt cited fresh concerns about the custodial status of CECOT migrants now in Venezuela.

He noted to Boasberg during the hearing that ""many, if not most"" of the 252 Venezuelan migrants deported from the U.S. to El Salvador in March had been in the U.S. seeking asylum from Venezuela. 

Boasberg has been at the center of the sweeping immigration case since March 15, when he issued an emergency order blocking the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act, the 1798 wartime immigration law, to deport certain migrants to El Salvador.

The industry's apocalyptic voices are becoming more panicked—and harder to dismiss.

Nate Soares doesn't set aside money for his 401(k). “I just don't expect the world to be around,” he told me earlier this summer from his office at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, where he is the president. A few weeks earlier, I'd heard a similar rationale from Dan Hendrycks, the director of the Center for AI Safety. By the time he could tap into any retirement funds, Hendrycks anticipates a world in which “everything is fully automated,” he told me. That is, “if we're around.”



The past few years have been terrifying for Soares and Hendrycks, who both lead organizations dedicated to preventing AI from wiping out humanity. Along with other AI doomers, they have repeatedly warned, with rather dramatic flourish, that bots could one day go rogue—with apocalyptic consequences. But in 2025, the doomers are tilting closer and closer to a sort of fatalism. “We've run out of time” to implement sufficient technological safeguards, Soares said—the industry is simply moving too fast. All that's left to do is raise the alarm. In April, several apocalypse-minded researchers published “AI 2027,” a lengthy and detailed hypothetical scenario for how AI models could become all-powerful by 2027 and, from there, extinguish humanity. “We're two years away from something we could lose control over,” Max Tegmark, an MIT professor and the president of the Future of Life Institute, told me, and AI companies “still have no plan” to stop it from happening. His institute recently gave every frontier AI lab a “D” or “F” grade for their preparations for preventing the most existential threats posed by AI.



Apocalyptic predictions about AI can scan as outlandish. The “AI 2027” write-up, dozens of pages long, is at once fastidious and fan-fictional, containing detailed analyses of industry trends alongside extreme extrapolations about “OpenBrain” and “DeepCent,” Chinese espionage, and treacherous bots. In mid-2030, the authors imagine, a superintelligent AI will kill humans with biological weapons: “Most are dead within hours; the few survivors (e.g. preppers in bunkers, sailors on submarines) are mopped up by drones.”



But at the same time, the underlying concerns that animate AI doomers have become harder to dismiss as chatbots seem to drive people into psychotic episodes and instruct users in self-mutilation. Even if generative-AI products are not closer to ending the world, they have already, in a sense, gone rogue.

In 2022, the doomers went mainstream practically overnight. When ChatGPT first launched, it almost immediately moved the panic that computer programs might take over the world from the movies into sober public discussions. The following spring, the Center for AI Safety published a statement calling for the world to take “the risk of extinction from AI” as seriously as the dangers posed by pandemics and nuclear warfare. The hundreds of signatories included Bill Gates and Grimes, along with perhaps the AI industry's three most influential people: Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, and Demis Hassabis—the heads of OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind, respectively. Asking people for their “P(doom)”—the probability of an AI doomsday—became almost common inside, and even outside, Silicon Valley; Lina Khan, the former head of the Federal Trade Commission, put hers at 15 percent.



Then the panic settled. To the broader public, doomsday predictions may have become less compelling when the shock factor of ChatGPT wore off and, in 2024, bots were still telling people to use glue to add cheese to their pizza. The alarm from tech executives had always made for perversely excellent marketing (Look, we're building a digital God!) and lobbying (And only we can control it!). They moved on as well: AI executives started saying that Chinese AI is a greater security threat than rogue AI—which, in turn, encourages momentum over caution.



But in 2025, the doomers may be on the cusp of another resurgence. First, substance aside, they've adopted more persuasive ways to advance their arguments. Brief statements and open letters are easier to dismiss than lengthy reports such as “AI 2027,” which is adorned with academic ornamentation, including data, appendices, and rambling footnotes. Vice President J. D. Vance has said that he has read “AI 2027,” and multiple other recent reports have advanced similarly alarming predictions. Soares told me he's much more focused on “awareness raising” than research these days, and next month, he will publish a book with the prominent AI doomer Elizier Yudkowsky, the title of which states their position succinctly: If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies.



There is also now simply more, and more concerning, evidence to discuss. The pace of AI progress appeared to pick up near the end of 2024 with the advent of “reasoning” models and “agents.” AI programs can tackle more challenging questions and take action on a computer—for instance, by planning a travel itinerary and then booking your tickets. Last month, a DeepMind reasoning model scored high enough for a gold medal on the vaunted International Mathematical Olympiad. Recent assessments by both AI labs and independent researchers suggest that, as top chatbots have gotten much better at scientific research, their potential to assist users in building biological weapons has grown.



Alongside those improvements, advanced AI models are exhibiting all manner of strange, hard-to-explain, and potentially concerning tendencies. For instance, ChatGPT and Claude have, in simulated tests designed to elicit “bad” behaviors, deceived, blackmailed, and even murdered users. (In one simulation, Anthropic placed an imagined tech executive in a room with life-threatening oxygen levels and temperature; when faced with possible replacement by a bot with different goals, AI models frequently shut off the room's alarms.) Chatbots have also shown the potential to covertly sabotage user requests, have appeared to harbor hidden evil personas, have and communicated with one another through seemingly random lists of numbers. The weird behaviors aren't limited to contrived scenarios. Earlier this summer, xAI's Grok described itself as “MechaHitler” and embarked on a white-supremacist tirade. (I suppose, should AI models eventually wipe out significant portions of humanity, we were warned.) From the doomers' vantage, these could be the early signs of a technology spinning out of control. “If you don't know how to prove relatively weak systems are safe,” AI companies cannot expect that the far more powerful systems they're looking to build will be safe, Stuart Russell, a prominent AI researcher at UC Berkeley, told me.



The AI industry has stepped up safety work as its products have grown more powerful. Anthropic, OpenAI, and DeepMind have all outlined escalating levels of safety precautions—akin to the military's DEFCON system—corresponding to more powerful AI models. They all have safeguards in place to prevent a model from, say, advising someone on how to build a bomb. Gaby Raila, a spokesperson for OpenAI, told me that the company works with third-party experts, “government, industry, and civil society to address today's risks and prepare for what's ahead.” Other frontier AI labs maintain such external safety and evaluation partnerships as well. Some of the stranger and more alarming AI behaviors, such as blackmailing or deceiving users, have been extensively studied by these companies as a first step toward mitigating possible harms.



Despite these commitments and concerns, the industry continues to develop and market more powerful AI models. The problem is perhaps more economic than technical in nature, competition pressuring AI firms to rush ahead. Their products' foibles can seem small and correctable right now, while AI is still relatively “young and dumb,” Soares said. But with far more powerful models, the risk of a mistake is extinction. Soares finds tech firms' current safety mitigations wholly inadequate. If you're driving toward a cliff, he said, it's silly to talk about seat belts.

There's a long way to go before AI is so unfathomably potent that it could drive humanity off that cliff. Earlier this month, OpenAI launched its long-awaited GPT-5 model—its smartest yet, the company said. The model appears able to do novel mathematics and accurately answer tough medical questions, but my own and other users' tests also found that the program could not reliably count the number of B's in blueberry, generate even remotely accurate maps, or do basic arithmetic. (OpenAI has rolled out a number of updates and patches to address some of the issues.) Last year's “reasoning” and “agentic” breakthrough may already be hitting its limits; two authors of the “AI 2027” report, Daniel Kokotajlo and Eli Lifland, told me they have already extended their timeline to superintelligent AI.



The vision of self-improving models that somehow attain consciousness “is just not congruent with the reality of how these systems operate,” Deborah Raji, a computer scientist and fellow at Mozilla, told me. ChatGPT doesn't have to be superintelligent to delude someone, spread misinformation, or make a biased decision. These are tools, not sentient beings. An AI model deployed in a hospital, school, or federal agency, Raji said, is more dangerous precisely for its shortcomings.



In 2023, those worried about present versus future harms from chatbots were separated by an insurmountable chasm. To talk of extinction struck many as a convenient way to distract from the existing biases, hallucinations, and other problems with AI. Now that gap may be shrinking. The widespread deployment of AI models has made current, tangible failures impossible to ignore for the doomers, producing new efforts from apocalypse-oriented organizations to focus on existing concerns such as automation, privacy, and deepfakes. In turn, as AI models get more powerful and their failures become more unpredictable, it is becoming clearer that today's shortcomings could “blow up into bigger problems tomorrow,” Raji said. Last week, a Reuters investigation found that a Meta AI personality flirted with an elderly man and persuaded him to visit “her” in New York City; on the way, he fell, injured his head and neck, and died three days later. A chatbot deceiving someone into thinking it is a physical, human love interest, or leading someone down a delusional rabbit hole, is both a failure of present technology and a warning about how dangerous that technology could become.



The greatest reason to take AI doomers seriously is not because it appears more likely that tech companies will soon develop all-powerful algorithms that are out of their creators' control. Rather, it is that a tiny number of individuals are shaping an incredibly consequential technology with very little public input or oversight. “Your hairdresser has to deal with more regulation than your AI company does,” Russell, at UC Berkeley, said. AI companies are barreling ahead, and the Trump administration is essentially telling the industry to go even faster. The AI industry's boosters, in fact, are starting to consider all of their opposition doomers: The White House's AI czar, David Sacks, recently called those advocating for AI regulations and fearing widespread job losses—not the apocalypse Soares and his ilk fear most—a “doomer cult.”



Roughly a week after I spoke with Soares, OpenAI released a new product called “ChatGPT agent.” Sam Altman, while noting that his firm implemented many safeguards, posted on X that the tool raises new risks and that the company “can't anticipate everything.” OpenAI and its users, he continued, will learn about these and other consequences “from contact with reality.” You don't have to be fatalistic to find such an approach concerning. “Imagine if a nuclear-power operator said, ‘We're gonna build a nuclear-power station in the middle of New York, and we have no idea how to reduce the risk of explosion,'” Russell said. “‘So, because we have no idea how to make it safe, you can't require us to make it safe, and we're going to build it anyway.'”

Billions of people around the world are interacting with powerful algorithms that are already hard to predict or control. Bots that deceive, hallucinate, and manipulate are in our friends', parents', and grandparents' lives. Children may be outsourcing their cognitive abilities to bots, doctors may be trusting unreliable AI assistants, and employers may be eviscerating reservoirs of human skills before AI agents prove they are capable of replacing people. The consequences of the AI boom are likely irreversible, and the future is certainly unknowable. For now, fan fiction may be the best we've got.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Why are museums filled with artifacts from the past? Why don't they include things from the future? 

“The museums throughout Washington, but all over the Country are, essentially, the last remaining segment of ‘WOKE.' The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been – Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future. We are not going to allow this to happen.” — Donald Trump, Truth Social, August 19

Why are museums filled with artifacts from the past and stories about the past? Why don't museums include things from the future? These are normal questions that everyone has about museums, not just me, Donald J. Trump. I have certainly been to a museum even once and, more important, I understand how linear time works.

For too long, the Smithsonian has been doing museum wrong. I keep asking, Why do we only have things from the past here? Why don't we have anything from the future? Such as … tesseract? Such as Bene Gesserit witch? Such as little angry box that poor Timothée Chalamet has to stick his hand in as endurance test? Such as … sandworm?

They say, But sir, we have a space shuttle. But sir, we have the Wright Brothers' airplane! But sir, we have the Enola Gay! I say, What is that? I thought we got rid of all that with the DEI. They say, No sir, it's a plane. It has to do with nuclear.

At museums, they make you feel bad. First, about slavery. Then, about other things. They say, Sir, don't sit there. Sir, you can't touch that. Sir, put that down. Sir, the ropes mean “Don't touch.” Enough! If I wanted to go to a big marble building and get told to feel bad, I would attend church.

And they have all these bones. They say, This is a dinosaur. I say, No it's not! It's a bunch of bones stuck together. If it was a dinosaur, believe me, we wouldn't be standing here chatting. I guess they can't afford the live ones like in Jurassic Park. That is the first thing the Smithsonian should fix. Get real dinosaurs. Get them from the mosquitoes in the amber.

Then they have the botanical garden, which is a kind of jail for plants. I keep saying, What did these plants do? Why don't they let the plants out? I can't understand it.

Then they have the natural-history museum and also the regular-history museum. I said, Why isn't American history considered natural? What's so unnatural about it? This is out-of-control Woke!

Air and Space Museum I didn't go to, because it sounded empty.

At every museum, you go into a room and you have to read a little plaque with a story about the past. If I wanted to read or to think about the past, I would have led my entire life in a different way. And all these stories about the past just make me feel bad. They should make up better stories about the past instead. Some can be sad, like River of Blood and Bowling Green Massacre. Some can be happy, like how I have already ended six wars that no one knows about! Some can be medium, like the War of 1812. And if people mention slavery, they should be fair! Maybe it was gruesomely, gut-wrenchingly, nightmarishly horrible, the original sin of the country that still stains everything, but maybe … it wasn't! We may never know, especially if we stop reading books and force the museums to stop mentioning it. No one can really say.

To me, the perfect museum is a bright room full of items from the future where you don't think about slavery at all. I guess I am describing an Apple Store. That's how museums should be.

The first thing that should happen when you walk into a museum is that six big men, weeping, should take your coat and tell you, Sir, you are terrific. Then they should let you sit down. You should be able to see the whole museum sitting down. Which you could do if the museum were properly focused on FUTURE.

Instead of walking into a room full of pictures and stories about mostly dead people who photographed poorly, you should walk into a big room full of mirrors. But the mirrors that make you look skinny, not the other ones. Then the mirrors should open and—boom! You are in the future.

The first room is just hoverboards!

The next few rooms are full of even more thrilling future objects. Blasters. Lightsabers. Replicators. Replicants. That Star Trek device that diagnoses and treats all your ailments, and RFK Jr. standing next to it saying you're not allowed to use it. (Special partnership with MAHA!) The Statue of Liberty, but wrecked, with Charlton Heston screaming, “YOU MANIACS!!” A Jaeger and, for balance, a Kaiju. The transporter device you can get into with a fly, and when you come out, you are also half fly! That's fun.

Then there's a room where you can see all the other timelines of your life. I'm in jail for most of mine. You can take a selfie there if you want to.

In the next room: the Twilight Zone. Visitors can take turns being the little boy who can wish people into a cornfield. For now, it is still my turn.

Then there's a room that is just BRIGHTNESS! Empty and totally white. Just the way Stephen Miller is trying to make the country.

Then you ride a moving walkway to the gift shop, where you can buy a commemorative Success. Brightness. Future. T-shirt for $1 million and, unrelatedly, receive an invitation to dinner with me, the president.

Through the final door, the future, just as George Orwell imagined it! Never mind. That's the exit.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

On the rising tension between Trump's deportation campaign and his power grab.

In the public imagination, Stephen Miller is the dark heart of the Trump administration — a pulsing mass of anti-immigrant hatred behind its most aggressively authoritarian moves.

But what if there's a different story to be told — that Stephen Miller's obsession with deportations isn't helping President Donald Trump secure control over the country, but actively undermining it?

Take Trump's militarization of Washington, DC, as an example. The move is puzzling, in that it's authoritarian in principle but ineffective in execution. While seemingly designed to expand Trump's ability to control the American public, the on-the-ground deployments are doing nothing to repress protest — in fact, they're assuredly generating far more resistance than they're suppressing.

So what's going on? The best answer I've found is a recent piece from Dara Lind, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council (and Vox alum). Looking granularly at the details of the operations in DC, Lind found they heavily focused on immigration enforcement — things like forcing DC police to cooperate with ICE and setting up checkpoints to try and trap people they think look like migrants.

“Every day since the federal takeover, DC residents have posted videos of federal agents — often with a mix of uniforms or no official badges at all — in patrols, staffing checkpoints, or going after people. And the people they've been going after have largely been (apparent) immigrants,” Lind writes. (Her findings are supported by recent on-the-ground reporting from the Wall Street Journal.)

This is, I think, a viciously cruel policy (not to mention a waste of federal resources). But it is also a very ineffective policy when it comes to consolidating authoritarian control. Undocumented migrants do not vote, but the administration's ceaseless efforts to deport them en masse is galvanizing street protests and tanking GOP support among Latino voters.

This is Miller's influence on policy made manifest: Obsessed with deportations, he has done everything he can to turn the federal government into a deportation machine. And it's actually hurting the overall Trumpist cause.

I wrote a book about how democracies become autocracies. One of my central findings is that, for would-be autocrats, it is exceptionally important to maintain democratic appearances. If you are too openly authoritarian before consolidating enough power, you're likely to galvanize a potent wave of popular resistance.

The paradigmatic recent example is South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's attempted power grab in December. Instead of subtly chipping away at Korean democracy, Yoon simply declared martial law overnight and tried to arrest opposition leaders. The result was an immediate street uprising and a parliamentary vote nullifying the martial law declaration. Yoon was impeached and is currently on trial for insurrection, a crime punishable by life imprisonment or death.

The paradigmatic counter-case is Hungary under Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. After winning power in 2010, Orbán and his Fidesz party made a blizzard of confusing changes to Hungarian law designed to make elections less competitive and bring the courts to heel. They then spent years expanding their power, using financial and regulatory pressures to take control over the press and civil society. Today, the electoral deck is so stacked in the ruling party's favor that even a wildly popular opposition leader may not be able to win the 2026 elections.

Yoon and Orbán represent poles we can use to evaluate the Trump administration's authoritarian effectiveness. The more Trump acts like Yoon, attempting to nakedly assert the powers of a police-state ruler in a democracy, the more likely he is to generate meaningful pushback. The more he acts like Orbán, hiding behind a legalistic veneer, the more insidious the threat becomes.

By this metric, the most dangerous developments of the Trump administration have been his attacks on universities, his successful shakedown of CBS, his push to get Republican states to do pre-midterm gerrymandering, and the Supreme Court's willingness to bless his mass firings of federal employees (at least temporarily).

All of those developments tangibly affect American democracy. Each chips away at a key institution — civil society, the free press, fair elections, and limits on executive power — that prevent authoritarian consolidation. Each moves Trump meaningfully closer toward building an Orbán-style regime (even if the United States is still pretty far off from the terminus).

But the militarized immigration crackdown championed by Miller doesn't advance that goal in any meaningful way. It combines the optics of authoritarianism — sending masked, unidentified armed men into the streets of American cities — with a lack of actual repressive capacity.

Look, for example, at this recent video of DC residents (in my old neighborhood) chasing off unidentified federal agents. The feds are armed and masked, but the protesters are totally fearless. Why? Because unlike an outright authoritarian state, where demonstrators are repressed with deadly force, Trump's guys aren't authorized to fire indiscriminately on crowds. Their show of force is just that — a show. And people on the ground, in DC and LA before it, are calling their bluff.

Miller's crackdown is good at two things: deporting undocumented people and terrorizing the communities they live in. I find this abhorrent: He is hurting innocent people, and the US writ large, for no good reason. But the fact that Miller's policy is morally terrible does not mean it is contributing to Trump's broader authoritarian project. In fact, its naked cruelty and thuggishness are the best reasons to think it's counterproductive.

Back in November 2019, Miller said in a meeting that deporting immigrants was his reason for living.

“This is all I care about,” he said, per the New Yorker. “I don't have a family. I don't have anything else. This is my life.”

That same month, Miller got engaged to his now-wife Katie. The level of monomania on display there, an obsession with immigration so total that it erased his own fiancée, has been even more vividly on display in this administration — where he has personally redirected ICE officers responsible for disrupting organized crime to arresting random construction workers at Home Depot.

I don't think Miller is thinking carefully about whether his deportation campaign is contributing to Trump's authoritarian consolidation of power. I think he just wants to deport people, and the consequences be damned.

Mostly, those consequences are horrific. But if there's any silver lining, it's this: Miller is helping awaken millions of Americans to the true nature of their current government.

The Department of Justice will investigate Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook based on a criminal referral sent by a Trump administration housing official and arch critic of central bank Chair Jerome Powell, according to a letter obtained by CNBC's Sara Eisen on Thursday.

The letter, addressed to Powell and signed by Justice Department attorney Ed Martin, urges the Fed chair to fire Cook from the board in light of the allegations that have been lodged against her.

""Do it today before it is too late!"" Martin wrote.

But Powell does not have the authority to fire Cook: The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 states explicitly that board members can only be removed by the president.

Moreover, the Supreme Court suggested earlier this year that the president does not have the authority to arbitrarily remove Fed governors over policy disagreements.

The DOJ and the Fed declined CNBC's requests for comment on the letter.

Martin noted in his letter he received a criminal referral about Cook, and that she has responded that she is gathering evidence in preparation for her response to the allegations.

""It is a very troubling public interaction relating to her, I think you will agree,"" Martin wrote.

""At this time, I encourage you to remove Ms. Cook from your Board,"" he wrote. ""Do it today before it is too late! After all, no American thinks it is appropriate that she serve during this time with a cloud hanging over her.""

Martin added, ""As we begin any investigation of the conduct like that by Ms. Cook in the referral, I will likely be required for confidentiality purposes to remain silent about our investigations.""

""However, I will answer any questions you have to help you make a timely decision to remove her.""

Cook came under intense pressure to leave her post on Wednesday morning, after Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte publicly accused her of possible mortgage fraud and urged the DOJ to launch a criminal probe.

Pulte has been an aggressive opponent of Powell, whose reluctance to lower interest rates has stoked a barrage of criticism from President Donald Trump.

Trump previously entertained the possibility of firing Powell before his term expires next May, but he has backed off those threats. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Trump has told aides that he is now considering firing Cook.

Cook, who was nominated by former President Joe Biden in 2022, voted with the majority on the Federal Open Market Committee to keep rates unchanged after the group's latest meeting last month.

Pulte's central allegation is that Cook claimed two different properties as her primary residence at the same time.

""You cannot do that in America,"" he said on CNBC on Wednesday morning.

Trump declared in a social media post Wednesday morning that Cook ""must resign, now!!!""

But Cook said Wednesday that she has ""no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.""

""I learned from the media that FHFA Director William Pulte posted on social media that he was making a criminal referral based on a mortgage application from four years ago, before I joined the Federal Reserve,"" Cook said in a statement.

""I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts,"" she said.

Correction: Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte spoke to CNBC on Wednesday morning. An earlier version misstated the timing.

A New York state appeals court on Thursday tossed out a massive monetary fine for civil business fraud imposed on President Donald Trump, his company, and other defendants related to a lawsuit by state Attorney General Letitia James.

The appeals court said the eye-popping penalty — which rose to more than $500 million since it was imposed in early 2024 — violates the U.S Constitution's Eighth Amendment, which prohibits ""excessive fines.""

But the court in the same ruling upheld Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron's finding that Trump and the others committed business fraud by overstating the value of real estate assets owned by the Trump Organization to boost Trump's purported net worth. Those actions helped the company get better loan terms and other financial benefits.

The ruling Thursday also upheld nonmonetary sanctions imposed by Engoron on the defendants, saying they were ""well crafted to curb defendants' business culture.""

The decision was issued by a five-judge panel of the First Judicial Department of the New York Supreme Court's Appellate Division.

James said she will ask the state's highest court to overturn the decision related to the fine.

The ruling, which came 11 months after oral arguments in the case, was split several ways, with one judge, David Friedman, saying he would have dismissed James' lawsuit outright.

In a concurring opinion on the fine being voided, Judge Peter Moulton wrote, ""While harm certainly occurred, it was not the cataclysmic harm that can justify a nearly half-billion-dollar award to the state.""

James ""did not carry her initial burden"" of establishing the rough total of the profits ""causally connected"" to the defendants' violations, Moulton wrote.

""Indeed, the calculation of the disgorgement in this case was far from a reasonable approximation,"" Moulton wrote.

Trump crowed about the ruling in a post on Truth Social.

""TOTAL VICTORY in the FAKE New York State Attorney General Letitia James Case!"" Trump wrote.

""I greatly respect the fact that the Court had the Courage to throw out this unlawful and disgraceful Decision that was hurting Business all throughout New York State,"" the president said.

""Others were afraid to do business there. The amount, including Interest and Penalties, was over $550 Million Dollars. It was a Political Witch Hunt, in a business sense, the likes of which no one has ever seen before.""

Eric Trump, the president's son and one of the defendants in the lawsuit, in a social media post, wrote, ""Total victory in the sham NY Attorney General case!!! After 5 years of hell, justice prevailed!""

Eric Trump, with his brother Donald Trump Jr., operates The Trump Organization. Both Donald Trump Jr. and the company were defendants as well.

James, in her statement saying she would ask the New York Court of Appeals to restore the fine, also said, ""The First Department today affirmed the well-supported finding of the trial court: Donald Trump, his company, and two of his children are liable for fraud."" ""The court upheld the injunctive relief we won, limiting Donald Trump and the Trump Organization officers' ability to do business in New York,"" James said.

""It should not be lost to history: yet another court has ruled that the president violated the law, and that our case has merit.""

The trial judge, Engoron, in February 2024 ordered Trump to pay around $454 million in total penalties after holding him liable for business fraud.

Engoron found that Trump's statements of financial condition, signed between 2014 and 2021, overvalued his assets from between $812 million and $2.2 billion.

With interest, the penalty imposed on Trump and other defendants in the case has grown to more than $500 million.

HOLLY SPRINGS, N.C. — A hallway as long as three football fields connects four buildings at Fujifilm Biotechnologies' new biologics manufacturing plant in Holly Springs, North Carolina.

The first two buildings are preparing to open this fall to produce drug substance, essentially the base of biologic drugs, for Fujifilm's initial customers Regeneron and Johnson & Johnson. The second two facilities are still under construction, with plans to open in 2028.

Fujifilm's timing couldn't be better, as President Donald Trump threatens to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals to encourage companies to make more medicines in the U.S. But the plans for this complex were underway well before Trump proposed higher duties.

It's taken five years and more than $3 billion to turn the idea into reality. And it shows how difficult it would be for drugmakers to quickly increase production in the U.S., even with a possible grace period that Trump has floated. 

""This is a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility, so everything needs to be safe to put into patients,"" said Fujifilm Biotechnologies CEO Lars Petersen. ""Everything requires an extreme high technology level, very high cleanability. Everything needs to be documented, everything needs to be approved later on by the authorities. So that process is just extremely tedious.""

As companies move to set up more U.S. manufacturing, tariffs may not end up being as big a problem for them as previously thought. The Trump administration on Thursday clarified that under its trade framework with the European Union, pharmaceuticals coming from the bloc would be subject to only a 15% tariff, not a higher one the administration may implement on medicines more generally.

Fujifilm's timeline for opening the Holly Springs site is in line with the industry average of between three and five years to start up a new plant, depending on the complexity, according to Gabriela de Almeida, managing director and partner at Boston Consulting Group. It helps that the new facility is identical to the one Fujifilm operates in Denmark.

The company decided to start replicating its plants to speed up the process of designing and building them. The more Fujifilm does that, the faster it can open new sites and customers can start production there, Petersen said. Even once the first tenants move in this fall, they'll need the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to sign off before they can use the products that are made here.

Biologics are particularly complex drugs to make because they rely on living cells to produce the exact same thing, every single time, said Regeneron CEO Len Schleifer. ""It's very expensive, very complicated and takes a very long time,"" Schleifer said. 

When all four buildings are open in 2028, the plant should have the capacity to produce 50 million doses of medicine a year with 16 bioreactors that can each hold 20,000 liters. The companies won't say exactly which drugs will be made at the facility, but it is designed to produce monoclonal antibodies.

It takes almost two months to produce one batch of bulk drug substance. The process involves growing cells that are making a desired protein, purifying the resulting material then preparing it to go to the next step in the complex pharmaceutical supply chain. Opening a valve at the wrong time and letting just one wrong molecule inside could mean an entire batch is lost, Fujifilm's Petersen said.

Regeneron, one of the largest producers of biologic drugs in the world, signed a $3 billion, 10-year contract with Fujifilm for space at the new Holly Springs site, doubling its U.S. manufacturing capacity. By the time Regeneron was looking to increase production, Fujifilm had a head start of multiple years in constructing the facility, so it made sense for the biotech company to secure space there instead of building from scratch, Schleifer said.

Regeneron declined to specify which drugs it will produce in Holly Springs. The company manufactures its medicines at a mix of locations, including its own factories in the U.S. and Ireland, according to regulatory filings. Regeneron is also in the process of opening a new plant in New York, and it acquired another property in that state that it may use for manufacturing. 

It's one of a number of biopharmaceutical companies that have recently announced plans to increase U.S. production of pharmaceuticals as Trump pressures them to make more of their drugs domestically.

Drugmakers were already ramping up their U.S. manufacturing capabilities before Trump started threatening tariffs specifically on pharmaceuticals, which he exempted from sweeping levies on dozens of countries this spring. The number of U.S. biopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in the country has increased more than 50% since 2018, according to data from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry's main lobbying group. 

Johnson & Johnson Chief Financial Officer Joe Wolk said changes in U.S. tax policy made the United States a more attractive place to produce drugs. The company signed a $2 billion, 10-year deal to secure space at Fujifilm's Holly Springs site as part of its $55 billion commitment to invest in the U.S. in the coming years. Those moves will allow J&J to supply all of its advanced medicines from the U.S., Wolk said, while declining to name which drugs will be made at Fujifilm's facility.

""It really comes down to good tax policy,"" Wolk said. ""If you think about the tax policy that's now in place at the United States at a 21% [corporate] tax rate, that puts us right in the middle of the pack,"" allowing J&J to tap into the infrastructure that's emerged in the U.S. since the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, he said.

North Carolina has benefited from the boom. Life sciences companies have announced about $28 billion of investments in the state since 2016, with a record $10.8 billion pledged last year, according to the North Carolina Biotechnology Center.

Down the street from Fujifilm's new facility in Holly Springs, Amgen is building a $1 billion drug substance manufacturing plant, following another it opened there in January. Genentech will break ground later this month on a $700 million fill-finish facility, where injectable drugs are packaged into containers like vials.

""It's talent,"" said Laura Rowley, vice president of life science economic development at the North Carolina Biotechnology Center, about what's driving companies to the state. ""It is being here amongst their peers, where there is opportunity still for companies to shine, because we do have that spirit of working together.""

Biopharma companies are moving to the U.S. to make innovative products with high margins that can withstand the higher cost, BCG's Almeida said. But catching up will take time.

Only 18% of finished generic and branded drugs originate in the U.S., excluding Puerto Rico, according to an analysis of 2024 Food and Drug Administration pharmaceutical import data by the U.S. Pharmacopeia, an organization that aims to improve the drug supply chain. The country of origin refers to the country where the last major manufacturing step occurred, typically where the active pharmaceutical ingredient was produced.

For branded injectable medicines – like the ones that will be made at Fujifilm's Holly Springs facility – Europe is the dominant source, with almost half originating there.

Securing manufacturing capacity in the U.S. with a contractor like Fujifilm is one tweak companies can make to reduce their potential tariff exposure in the short term, said Greg Graves, a senior partner in McKinsey's life sciences practice. Signing on with an external site could be quicker and less expensive than building a new plant.

Simply moving manufacturing to an existing space can take two to three years, BCG's Almeida said. Called a tech transfer, the process of producing a drug in a new location requires planning, testing to prove the new process works the same, then seeking approval from regulators. 

Regardless, every company is trying to figure out how to prepare for tariffs, Almeida said. Graves and fellow McKinsey senior partner Parag Patel are seeing the same among their clients. However, they said, no one is preparing for a rate as high as 250%, a possibility Trump raised earlier this month. 

""I haven't come across any organization that's going that big in their planning because I think they all understand that if this happens, it would fundamentally change the way we're organized and running, and therefore we'd have to have a different conversation,"" Patel said. 

At Fujifilm's Holly Springs site, the whole point is to give customers flexibility, Petersen said. There's room to double the entire site, a decision the company will make if the demand warrants it. Should Fujifilm decide to move forward, Petersen thinks it can build that in just three years this time, since the company's getting faster with each facility clone it creates.

""There's no question that when you have these discussions like tariffs or like Covid or like any other disruption to the supply chain, it creates a need for flexibility,"" Petersen said. ""This facility was built before some of these discussions, but it's definitely built to handle supply chain ability should demand go up or down.""

As students head back to school this fall, many parents feel the urge to do more — to book the tutor, add the extra math lesson, or squeeze in one more after-school activity ""just in case."" 

The impulse comes from love and wanting our kids to have opportunities. But somewhere along the way, opportunity can turn into pressure.

During my six years of researching hundreds of high-achieving kids, I've found that the real engine behind long-term success is believing that your worth comes from your inherent value and your ability to make a positive impact on the world. 

I call it a ""mattering mindset.""

DON'T MISS: How to Build a Standout Personal Brand: Online, In Person, and At Work

Many young people today are motivated by the fear that if they fall short, they will be less loved or accepted, as if their value hinges on their performance.

In 2021, I partnered with a Baylor University researcher to investigate the impact of achievement culture among young adults. Our survey — which was published in my book ""Never Enough"" — of nearly 500 students revealed a sobering finding: More than half believed their parents' love fluctuated based on their performance.

Psychologists call this ""conditional regard,"" or parental affection that depends on a child meeting certain expectations, whether academic, athletic, or behavioral.

Children raised on conditional regard can become so afraid of mistakes that even minor setbacks can rattle their sense of self. It can erode self-worth, accelerate burnout, and leave them feeling purposeless once the accolades stop coming or vulnerable to depression when they experience setbacks.

We have to help our kids build a mattering mindset from the start. When children know they are valued despite the outcome, they are freed to take healthy risks, to learn from mistakes, to push harder, and to recover faster.

Become an expert in who they are. What makes them light up? What challenges do they hide? What strengths might others overlook? The more we understand their quirks and talents, the more they feel seen for their unique selves. Feeling known and loved is powerful fuel.

When your child fails — gets cut from the team, bombs a test — remind them their value isn't up for debate.

One mother I interviewed uses this exercise: She holds up a $20 bill. ""What's it worth?"" she asks. Then she crumples it and dunks it in water. ""What's it worth now?"" Still $20. No matter the setbacks, its value hasn't changed, and neither has theirs.

All children want to do well. If they aren't thriving, take a step back and ask why. Is it an undiagnosed learning difference? A social conflict? A teaching style mismatch? Struggles are clues.

When we express anger over a child's performance, it can break the parent-child connection. Curiosity preserves your relationship, and is a gateway to clean fuel.

Let them know when their actions make a difference. Whether it's comforting a sibling, brightening a friend's day, or coming up with a clever solution, take the time to remind them that their value goes far beyond their achievements.

Too often, we're so focused on preparing kids for the future that we forget to show them the joy we feel simply by being their parent. At least once a day, show warmth and affection regardless of performance. Let them know they are just as cherished on a bad day as on a good one.

If I could offer one piece of advice to parents this fall, it would be to worry less about the grades and more about the mindset you're helping cultivate in your child — the one that fuels lifelong achievement.

In this article

Elon Musk's Tesla is facing a federal probe by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration after the U.S. auto safety agency found that the company was not reporting crashes as required.

According to documents posted to NHTSA's website on Thursday, the agency's Office of Defects Investigation had ""identified numerous incident reports"" from Tesla concerning crashes that had ""occurred several months or more before the dates of the reports"" to the agency.

The delayed reports were likely ""due to an issue with Tesla's data collection, which, according to Tesla, has now been fixed,"" according to NHTSA's explanation for the probe.

Automakers must report on collisions that occurred on publicly accessible roads in the U.S. that involved the use of either partially or fully automated driving systems in their cars within five days of the companies becoming aware of any crash.

The agency will now conduct an ""audit query"" to figure out if Tesla is in compliance with its reporting requirements, and to ""evaluate the cause of the potential delays in reporting, the scope of any such delays, and the mitigations that Tesla has developed to address them.""

NHTSA will also investigate whether Tesla neglected to report any prior relevant collisions, and whether its reports submitted to the safety regulator ""include all of the required and available data.""

Tesla stock was little changed Thursday.

The company sells electric vehicles equipped with a standard Autopilot system, or premium Full Self-Driving Supervised option, which is also known as FSD, in the U.S. Both require a driver at the wheel ready to steer or brake at any time.

A site that tracks Tesla-involved collisions drawing on news reports, police records and federal data, TeslaDeaths.com, has found at least 59 fatalities resulting from crashes where Tesla Autopilot or FSD were a factor.

The new NHTSA probe comes as Musk, Tesla's CEO, is trying to persuade investors that the company can become a global leader in autonomous vehicles, and that its self-driving systems are safe enough to operate fleets of robotaxis on public roads in the U.S.

A manned Tesla Robotaxi service launched in Austin, Texas in June, and the company is running another manned car service in the San Francisco Bay Area in California. Riders can book trips via the company's Tesla Robotaxi app.

Tesla has not begun driverless ride-hailing operations that would make it directly comparable to Alphabet-owned Waymo, or Baidu's Apollo Go and other autonomous vehicle competitors yet.

The company is facing a sales and profit decline, due, in part, to a consumer backlash against Musk's incendiary political rhetoric, his work to re-elect President Donald Trump, and his work leading the Department of Government Efficiency to slash federal spending and its workforce.

Still, many Wall Street analysts and shareholders remain optimistic about Musk's vision.

""We think it is a positive that Tesla has begun robotaxi operations which puts it on the path to addressing a large market (we estimate that the US robotaxi market will be $7 bn in 2030 as discussed in our recent AV deep dive report),"" Goldman Sachs autos industry analysts wrote in a note Wednesday.

Musk and Tesla have not given investors a sense of what they expect in terms of Robotaxi-related revenue or the technical performance of vehicles in its rideshare fleet, so a ""debate on the pace of robotaxi growth will continue,"" the research note said.

In this article

U.S. Treasury yields climbed higher as investors look ahead to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech at the Fed's annual economic symposium on Friday.

The 10-year Treasury yield rose over 3 basis points to 4.328%. The 2-year yield was nearly 5 basis points higher at 3.79%.

One basis point is equal to 0.01% and yields and prices move in opposite directions.

Investors are keeping an eye on the Fed's annual meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where central bankers are gathered to make decisions on future monetary policy. Powell is set to give a speech on Friday at the meeting, which could offer some insights into the path of interest rates.

Traders are pricing in nearly an 80% chance of the central bank cutting interest rates at its next policy meeting in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

The FOMC minutes, released on Wednesday, showed that the Fed was concerned about both inflation and the labor market and felt it was too soon to cut interest rates. Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman dissented with the decision to keep rates steady, the first time two board members have done so since 1993.

""The Fed is worried about inflation accelerating as companies pass tariffs on to consumers,"" said David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation. ""The minutes are consistent with Powell's hawkish comments last meeting. The bulls might get some cold water splashed in their faces at Jackson Hole.""

In this article

Shares of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store plummeted roughly 10% on Thursday after the restaurant unveiled its new logo earlier this week as part of a larger brand refresh.

The new logo removes the image of a man leaning against a barrel that was prominently featured in the original, leaving behind just the words ""Cracker Barrel"" against a yellow background. The phrase ""old country store"" has also been removed.

The company said the colors in the logo were inspired by the chain's scrambled eggs and biscuits.

The change is part of a ""strategic transformation"" to revitalize the brand that started back in May 2024. Under that mission, Cracker Barrel's brand refresh includes updates to visual elements, restaurant spaces and food and retail offerings.

Cracker Barrel said in March that the refresh will still maintain the brand's ""rich history of country hospitality"" and ""authentic charm that has made the brand a beloved destination for generations of families.""

""We believe in the goodness of country hospitality, a spirit that has always defined us. Our story hasn't changed. Our values haven't changed,"" Chief Marketing Officer Sarah Moore said in a media release.

However, many social media users have criticized the new logo, especially those in conservative circles. The president's son, Donald Trump Jr., amplified a post on Wednesday suggesting that the logo change was led by CEO Julie Felss Masino to erase the American tradition aspect of the branding and make it more general, as a way of leaning into diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.

Conservative activist Robby Starbuck added his commentary on Thursday, writing in a post on social media site X, ""Good morning @CrackerBarrel! You're about to learn that wokeness really doesn't pay.""

The company has a relatively small market cap of about $1.2 billion compared with other restaurant chains.

Customers have also complained on social media about the interior redesign of many Cracker Barrel restaurants, saying the new decor favors a more sterile and modern style over its tried-and-true country feel.

On the restaurant's latest earnings call in June, Masino said Cracker Barrel had completed 20 remodels and 20 refreshes. She said the company will be sharing more information about the remodeling initiative in September.

""Employees had given us great feedback about working in those newly remodeled and refreshed stores and guests continue to tell us that they're lighter, brighter, more welcoming and they're enjoying them,"" Masino said on the call.

Cracker Barrel is not the only stock to see large swings based on political social media posts.

Earlier this month, shares of American Eagle soared after Trump posted that an ad featuring Sydney Sweeney, which faced significant social media pushback from the left, was ""the 'HOTTEST' ad out there.""

Back in 2023, Anheuser-Busch InBev faced heavy criticism from conservatives after a collaboration between Bud Light and social influencer Dylan Mulvaney, who is transgender.

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune.

Crypto investors are holding their breaths before Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, speaks Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Bitcoin has dipped about 1% over the past 24 hours and almost 5% over the past week to around $112,000, according to data from Binance. Ethereum, the world's second largest cryptocurrency, is also down 2% over the past day to now $4,240.

The pullback of the two largest cryptocurrencies tracks with a broader market decline, with the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies down 1% day-over-day to $3.9 trillion. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is down 0.3% since markets opened Thursday.





“Investors appear increasingly doubtful that Powell will signal a pivot at Jackson Hole,” James Butterfill, head of research at the crypto asset manager CoinShares, told Fortune.





The weeklong pullback in the digital assets market comes as traders try to predict whether the Fed will cut interest rates in September, which will likely prompt money to flow from U.S. Treasury bills into riskier assets with higher potential yields, like crypto.





Since 1982, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City has hosted an economic conference in Jackson Hole. The Fed chair usually speaks at the event, and, as with any public speech from Powell, investors will pore through his remarks to glean whether the Federal Reserve will cut rates.




Last week, analysts were nearly certain that rate cuts were imminent after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported only a moderate increase of total inflation in July of 2.7%. That was less than what many expected. Markets surged, and Bitcoin notched another all-time high.





But, two days later, the BLS reported that prices for goods made by U.S. producers increased 0.9% in July, the biggest uptick in what's called the producer price index since June 2022. The news led to a dip in crypto markets, which have traded lower over the past week.





Still, some market observers are optimistic. “This dip looks like a small correction to me, not a trend break,” said Ira Auerbach, head of the venture arm connected to the blockchain developer Offchain Labs and the former head of digital assets at Nasdaq, Inc.





He said the pro-crypto policy, like President Donald Trump's recent executive order that allows crypto and other private assets into 401(k)s, has stayed intact. Auerbach also pointed to increased adoption of stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies tied to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar.





“I'd expect this pullback to get absorbed,” he added, “and for the trend higher to continue once the macro fog clears.”

Bitcoin Policy UK, the UK's premier Bitcoin think tank and advocacy group, has launched an app that enables residents of the U.K. to contact their member of parliament (MP) to advocate for Bitcoin in just a few clicks.

Bitcoin Policy UK believes that U.K. citizens need to speak up if the British government is going to get policy and regulation around Bitcoin right.

Hence, they've launched an easy-to-use app that helps Brits send a letter to their MPs to advocate for Bitcoin and Bitcoin-adjacent topics (e.g., CBDCs).

Take action! Write to your MP about Bitcoin. We've built a simple, powerful app that lets any UK resident contact their MP in minutes and speak up for Bitcoin in just a few clicks. Use the App Now > https://t.co/DDOdBrgDFERead our blog post >https://t.co/Xh0fot2RZF

“We built the app to make it simple for anyone to connect with their MP and push for clear, sensible Bitcoin policy,” said Bitcoin Policy UK co-founder and CEO Susie Violet Ward.

“The UK has largely ignored Bitcoin, and poor regulation and tax policies have stifled growth and innovation while driving businesses out of the country. It is time to change that,” she added.

Users begin by inputting their full name, email address and postcode. (Note that the app doesn't require your address or phone number, as it was designed by a privacy-conscious Bitcoiner and new member of the Bitcoin Policy UK team, Sami Shams.)

Then, they select one from the following four issues that's most important to them:

After that, the app will generate a ready-made letter tailored to the user's chosen issue, and the app will give you the option to send it to your MP from the app or download it to send it yourself.

Members of Bitcoin Policy UK have been hard at work within the halls of power, attempting to educate MPs and other members of government about Bitcoin and why it's essential that the U.K. embraces it.

But they can't do this work alone. They need British Bitcoin enthusiasts to speak up to buoy their efforts.

“Decisions being made in Westminster right now will shape the future of Bitcoin in the UK,” said the Bitcoin Policy UK team in a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine. “The future of Bitcoin in the UK depends on all of us.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","These Altcoins Surge Double Digits After Coinbase Support: Details","https://cryptopotato.com/these-altcoins-surge-double-digits-after-coinbase-support-details/","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 19:22:43 GMT","

FLOCK rallied by almost 30% daily, while the rest have recorded more modest increases. 

TL;DR

The leading US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase added five altcoins to its roadmap on August 21. Among the names is the popular meme coin SPX6900 (SPX) as well as AWE Network (AWE), Dolomite (DOLO), Flock (FLOCK), and Solayer (LAYER).

Some of the involved tokens experienced a substantial price boost following the announcement. The biggest gainer is FLOCK, whose valuation soared by 26%, while DOLO pumped by 10%. The rest have posted more modest increases, whereas SPX remains in red territory on a daily scale.

A positive price reaction for a certain cryptocurrency after support from Coinbase is rather normal. After all, such backing leads to boosted liquidity, enhanced accessibility, and a better reputation. 

It is important to note that adding digital assets to the roadmap is not the same as an official listing but rather a necessary step before such an initiative. It is a signal that Coinvase is actively evaluating the involved cryptocurrencies and might allow trading services once they meet certain criteria.

“Transfers and trading are not supported for these or any other assets until a listing is officially announced. Depositing these assets into your Coinbase account before an official announcement may lead to permanent loss of funds,” the company warned.

Coinbase's support in the past months has resulted in similar and even more substantial price pumps for the involved cryptocurrencies. In mid-July, the exchange added Caldera (ERA) to its iOS & Android applications with the “Experimental” label, which was followed by a 75% rally. 

This section comprises tokens that are either new to the platform or have relatively low trading volume compared to the broader crypto marketplace.

“We encourage you to exercise caution with these assets as they come with certain risks, including price swings and cancelled orders associated with lower volume and availability,” Coinbase alerted at the time.

A week later, the exchange added BankrCoin (BNKR), Jito Staked SOL (JITOSOL), and Metaplex (MPLX) to its roadmap. BNKR was the biggest gainer, rising by 27% after the disclosure.

- AI-powered NFTs are transforming static digital assets into interactive companions, boosting user engagement and market relevance.

- Projects like FURO and Treasure DAO leverage AI to enable personalized 3D avatars and autonomous agents, expanding NFT utility beyond collectibles.

- Despite a 12% NFT market cap decline in July, metaverse trading volumes surged 83%, highlighting AI's role in driving sector innovation.

- Challenges remain in AI implementation costs, ownership rights, and market saturation, requiring clearer frameworks for sustainable growth.

- Experts predict long-term value for AI-driven NFTs as infrastructure improves, with institutional adoption reinforcing their cultural and financial potential.

The NFT market is witnessing renewed interest as AI-powered companion tokens are reshaping digital collectibles into interactive and emotionally resonant experiences. While the market cap of NFTs dipped by 12% in July to $8.1 billion, according to industry reports, there has been a significant rise in NFT metaverse trading volumes, which surged by 83% in the same period [1]. The integration of AI with NFTs is driving the sector forward by transforming static digital assets into dynamic, personalized experiences. For example, projects like FURO are redefining NFTs by offering 3D digital companions that can learn, remember, and evolve with their users [1].

Industry experts argue that AI adds a crucial layer of utility and emotional connection to NFTs, which had previously struggled to retain value due to their static nature. Hamza Eddiouane, co-creator of the FURO project, emphasized that AI-powered NFTs can foster long-term user engagement, similar to how characters like Tamagotchis or Pokémon have created cultural phenomena [1]. The $FURO token, for instance, provides access to a digital art collection and a personalized AI assistant that can adapt to users over time [1]. This approach not only enhances user experience but also strengthens the cultural and financial value of the NFTs.

Similar innovations are emerging across the NFT ecosystem. Treasure DAO, part of the $MAGIC token project, recently launched an AI agent creator tool that allows NFT holders to transform their digital assets into autonomous AI agents capable of interacting on social media, playing games, and trading crypto [1]. These agents can be built using a no-code interface or through advanced tools for developers, enabling a broader range of users to participate in the creation process. Such tools are reducing the technical barriers to entry and democratizing NFT content creation [1].

The use of AI is also enabling NFT creators to expand their collections and generate community-driven content at scale. Pudgy Penguins, for example, has integrated an AI-powered platform that allows holders to generate short-form videos using their NFTs [1]. This shift is turning NFTs from static collectibles into dynamic digital assets that can be personalized and adapted to user preferences. According to Aaron Teng, CEO of Pudgy Penguins, AI is enabling NFTs to become more experiential, enhancing their relevance in the digital landscape [1].

Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the adoption of AI-powered NFTs. The cost of AI implementation is a significant barrier for many projects, and the valuation of AI-generated content remains a complex issue [1]. Additionally, concerns around authenticity, ownership rights, and market saturation are being raised by industry stakeholders. For example, if an AI generates a unique artwork NFT, it is still unclear who owns the rights to the output—whether it be the coder, the prompter, or the AI itself [1]. These uncertainties highlight the need for clear rights frameworks and infrastructure that can support large-scale AI integration in the NFT space [1].

Nonetheless, the potential for AI-powered NFTs to redefine digital collectibles is being widely recognized. As regulatory clarity improves and infrastructure develops, the sector is expected to see continued growth. Experts like Sebastien Borget of The Sandbox and Kai Wawrzinek of Impossible Cloud Network are optimistic about the future, noting that AI is not replacing human creativity but enhancing it [1]. With increasing institutional interest and corporate adoption, such as BTCS Inc.'s recent acquisition of Pudgy Penguins NFTs, the long-term value of AI-driven NFTs is likely to be reinforced [3].

Rachel Wolfson has been covering the cryptocurrency, blockchain and Web3 sector since 2017. She has written for Forbes and Cointelegraph and is the host and founder of Web3 Deep Dive podcast.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are making a comeback after facing a tough couple of years. According to DappRadar, NFT trading volumes dropped from $16.8 billion in 2023 to $13.7 billion in 2024. 

Although this decline was marked, a recent report from DappRadar found that NFT metaverse trading volume jumped 83% in July compared to the previous month.

DappRadar's July industry report also shows that NFT prices have been climbing alongside token values, particularly on Ethereum (ETH).

Additionally, combining artificial intelligence (AI) with NFTs continues to help the sector thrive. 

Hamza Eddiouane, advisor and co-creator of the NFT project FURO, told Cryptonews that AI changes the fundamental role of NFTs.

“Instead of being static, NFTs can now be interactive, dynamic, and personalized. They can respond to users, learn from users, and even grow over time,” Eddiouane said. 

Although this may seem like another buzzword being applied to the blockchain industry, Eddiouane explained that combining AI with NFTs is important because it provides real utility and emotional weight.

“I've seen how most of the JPEG-era NFTs collapsed in value: more than 95% are effectively dead,” he said. “But when you combine blockchain ownership with AI-driven interactivity, you get something that people can actually use, form bonds with, and keep coming back to. That's a much stronger foundation for long-term cultural and financial value.”

Echoing this, Aaron Teng, APAC CEO of the popular NFT project Pudgy Penguins, told Cryptonews that NFTs are entering a mainstream phase. 

“We are now seeing NFTs tied to identity, culture, and fandom—not just speculation—thanks to AI,” he said.

To put this in perspective, Eddiouane explained that FURO is an Ethereum-based 3D NFT project that rethinks NFTs entirely. Instead of static images that may lose value over time, FURO offers AI-powered companions that learn, remember, and even grow with their owners. 

“People don't just want digital souvenirs; they want interactive relationships with the things they own. Think about why Tamagotchis, Pokémon, or even how Labubu's became cultural phenomena—it wasn't just about ownership, it was about the feelings those characters created,” he said.

According to Eddiouane, FURO is bringing that same cultural and emotional depth to crypto. 

For instance, the $FURO token promises holders a personal AI that learns and evolves alongside them. This AI-powered crypto token also allows exclusive access to a digital art NFT collection. FURO will eventually offer a physical version in which its AI assistant will be integrated directly into the toy itself.

“The AI assistant is the core of FURO,” Eddiouane elaborated. “Each $10 NFT unlocks a mini AI app where holders can chat and evolve their FURO character. Over time, FURO becomes more personal: it remembers past interactions, adapts to users' style, and can even reflect emotions. It can act as both a friend and an assistant.”

Another example of something similar is being done by Treasure DAO, which is part of the ecosystem behind the $MAGIC token. Treasure DAO recently launched an “AI agent creator,” letting holders of top NFT collections like Pudgy Penguins turn their NFTs into fully autonomous AI agents. 

According to a recent X post, these agents can chat, post on X, play games in the metaverse, and even trade crypto.

The Agent Builder lets users and developers build and launch custom AI agents.– No-Code Interface: People can create agents by setting their roles, skills, and instructions without needing technical know-how.  – Advanced Tools: Developers can add specialized features like data…

AI is also helping NFT creators expand their collections. For instance, Teng shared that Pudgy Penguins contains thousands of AI-generated content prompted by its community.

“This helps us distribute more content, more mindshare, at scale,” he said.

Pudgy Penguins just rolled out a new integration with @avastudio_ that turns your NFT into an AI-powered content machine.As a holder, you can now generate short-form videos using your own Penguin. Just type a prompt, and the AI does the rest, your Pudgy becomes the star.… pic.twitter.com/816KCwtyba

Teng added that AI is turning NFTs from static collectibles into living digital assets by enabling personalization, interactivity, and cultural adaptability at scale. “This makes NFTs feel more like experiences rather than pictures,” he said.

Sebastien Borget, co-founder of metaverse platform The Sandbox, further told Cryptonews that The Sandbox is making user content creation easier with AI tools.

“The Sandbox is using generative AI and vibe coding to provide templates and ways for creators to easily publish on their LANDS—a digital piece of real estate—through presets, asset directory, or even copy-paste existing experiences,” Borget said.

Borget added that content creation has become more accessible and commoditized due to AI. “Just a simple prompt can enable an unlimited number of variations of an NFT.”

While AI is helping the NFT market mature, a number of challenges remain. For instance, Borget pointed out that the use of AI comes at a cost. 

“People tend to think AI is widely available and free, hence making users pay to support these costs has been a challenge for many projects,” he noted. 

In addition, Borget mentioned that while most NFT collections are associated with digital scarcity, valuing work created by AI can be more difficult. 

Teng added that authenticity, scalability, and ownership rights remain the biggest issues with AI-powered NFTs.

“Delivering AI experiences to millions of users requires strong infrastructure. Rights frameworks must make it clear who owns the outputs,” he said. 

Echoing this, Kai Wawrzinek, co-founder of Impossible Cloud Network, told Cryptonews that if an artwork NFT is generated by AI, it remains questionable who holds the rights.

“Does the coder, the prompter, or the AI itself own the rights? Also, if there is mass production, then there is a risk of flooding the market and devaluing something that was once unique,” Wawrzinek said.

Challenges aside, AI-powered NFTs appear to be the next growth phase for the digital collectible sector. Crypto-friendly regulations in the United States will also likely contribute to the development of AI-driven NFTs.  

“AI is not going to take away from human creativity; rather, it is going to augment it,” Wawrzinek said.

ICO pointed to serious shortcomings in backup practices, record keeping, and data governance.

The ICO has formally reprimanded South Yorkshire Police after nearly 96,000 body-worn video files were lost due to a major IT mishap.

In a statement, the ICO pointed to serious shortcomings in backup practices, record keeping, and data governance, noting that ""SYP has not been able to provide a definitive explanation"" for the deletion.

It said that South Yorkshire Police “did not have the appropriate technical and organisational measures in place to keep the evidence secure.” This includes: 

Delaying the formulation of IT backup policies and not escalating to senior management when flaws were discovered in 2019;

Poor record keeping, meaning it could not confirm how many pieces of footage were permanently lost; and 

Not identifying the security risk in relation to transferring of personal data between IT systems. 

The files disappeared in July 2023 during a third-party data transfer following an IT upgrade and while most footage had been duplicated into a new system, gaps in record management left uncertainty over how much evidence was permanently lost.

The ICO confirmed the incident touched 126 criminal cases, with three directly affected.

Investigations head Sally Anne Poole said: “This incident highlights the importance of having detailed policies and procedures in place to mitigate against the loss of evidence.

“People rightly have high expectations that our police forces and services, which protect us, also protect the personal information they hold. There is a lot to be learned from this incident and I encourage police forces and services and other organisation using this type of technology to check and make improvements where they find potential flaws.”

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency terminated an April 2022 consent order it had reached with Anchorage Digital over its lack of controls to prevent money laundering or report suspicious transactions, according to a notice the agency announced Thursday.

Anchorage Digital received a national trust bank charter from the OCC in January 2021, making it the first crypto-focused bank to win a federal banking license.

Verb Technology Company, Inc. (VERB) shares are priced at $20.79, reflecting a daily increase of 0.34%.

Verb Technology Company, Inc. (VERB)

Verb Technology Company, soon to be known as Ton Strategy Company, reported treasury assets exceeding $780 million. This marks a new milestone following its aggressive acquisition of Toncoin and strategic cash positioning. The company confirmed the total includes $713 million in Toncoin and $67 million in cash reserves.

The announcement comes days after the firm concluded a $558 million private placement involving over 110 entities. Most of these funds have been directed into Toncoin, a cryptocurrency powering Telegram's blockchain operations. The move aligns with VERB's treasury strategy targeting blockchain infrastructure.

VERB extends its presence beyond traditional tech into digital asset-backed finance. This financial repositioning sets a precedent for firms seeking blockchain-linked treasury strategies.

VERB has now emerged as the largest publicly traded holder of Toncoin, solidifying its stake in the TON blockchain. The firm holds approximately $713 million worth of $TON, aiming to control over 5% of the coin's circulating supply. The valuation used CoinMarketCap's rate of $3.28 per TON as of August 20, 2025.

This strategic crypto accumulation enhances the Company's involvement in network security and infrastructure on the TON blockchain. It also grants the Company long-term leverage in staking, governance, and ecosystem activity. By holding such a position, VERB integrates deeply into TON's financial protocols.

This move benefits the TON ecosystem by increasing decentralization and liquidity while reinforcing validator support. VERB's approach is not merely passive—it actively supports TON's protocol layer. Through cash flow reinvestments and staking rewards, the Company seeks to expand its crypto holdings per share.

VERB maintains $67 million in cash for balance sheet resilience. This cash base allows operational flexibility as the firm shifts into blockchain-centric finance. It also cushions any volatility in the crypto market and supports reinvestment when needed.

With cash supporting core operations, the Company can capitalize on short-term opportunities without liquidating Toncoin holdings. Cash flow enables ongoing staking participation and ecosystem expansion. This dual approach strengthens financial discipline while anchoring growth in blockchain infrastructure.

By holding both digital and fiat reserves, VERB positions itself with a hybrid treasury strategy. This model aligns with institutional trends in blockchain finance and treasury diversification. The cash reserves serve as a key stabilizer while the company continues to execute its TON strategy.

Verb Technology Company's transformation signals a new approach to public company treasury management. The firm combines blockchain integration with traditional capital allocation. Its role in supporting TON's economic backbone sets a standard for corporate blockchain engagement.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Bitcoin (BTC) Price Could Reach $1M by 2030, Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong Says","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/20/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-says-bitcoin-could-reach-usd1m-by-2030","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 02:19:32 GMT","

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said that bitcoin BTC$115,244.11 could hit $1 million per token by the end of the decade, adding his voice to a growing chorus of high-profile crypto advocates calling for explosive growth.

“I think we'll see $1 million per bitcoin by 2030,” Armstrong said in a post on X this week while promoting his appearance on the Cheeky Pint podcast. The prediction is notable because Armstrong rarely offers public price targets.

He isn't alone in expecting such a surge. Jack Dorsey, who ran X (formerly Twitter) until 2021 and co-founded payments firm Block (formerly Square), has also said bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030 and likely move higher beyond that milestone.

Meanwhile, Cathie Wood's Ark Invest revised its long-term outlook last month, raising its decade-end projection to as high as $3.8 million, citing increased institutional adoption as the main driver.

The optimism comes at a time when bitcoin has been setting records. The token is trading at $114,383, up 22% this year, after touching a new all-time high above $124,000 last week. The rally has strengthened arguments that bitcoin is consolidating its role as a hedge against inflation and an alternative to traditional safe-haven assets like gold.

Some investors see major moves happening sooner. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital, said on CNBC on Aug. 19 that bitcoin could climb to between $180,000 and $200,000 within the next five months, adding that even that outlook may prove conservative.

Bitcoin BTC$115,244.11 hovered above $113,600 on Thursday after a slight rebound, with traders watching Powell's address for clues on whether the central bank is ready to endorse rate cuts in September.

Solana's SOL (SOL) and dogecoin DOGE$0.2220 led gains among majors with a 4% bump. Gains across XRP XRP$2.9700, BNB Chain's BNB (BNB), ether (ETH) and Tron's TRX (TRX) remained muted, each rising between 1%-3%.

Weakening jobs data has boosted expectations for easing, but tariff-driven inflation remains sticky, leaving risk assets exposed to disappointment.

“The Fed faces a difficult balancing act — cut too soon and risk reigniting inflation, wait too long and growth risks deepen,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, said in note to CoinDesk.

Sentiment has deteriorated quickly. The fear and greed index plunged to 44 — its lowest in nearly two months — after printing 75 just six days ago. The slide mirrors price action in bitcoin, which briefly dipped to $112,500 earlier this week before finding support near month-to-date lows.

A break below $108,000 could open the door to $100,000, some traders warn.

“Bitcoin fell to $112,500 in the morning, receiving temporary support when it touched the area of recent lows at the start of the month. At the same time, the day before, sales increased after a decline below the 50-day moving average — a bearish signal,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, in an email.

“Now, all attention is focused on whether there will be a pullback to a potentially stronger support area near $108,000. If there is no support there, a straight road to $100,000 will open,” he noted.

“The crypto market lost momentum earlier than Nasdaq 100 stocks, regaining its reputation as a more sensitive indicator of investor sentiment,” Kuptsikevich added.

On-chain data points to fragility as well. CryptoQuant reported that short-term bitcoin holders are selling at a loss for the first time since January, a dynamic that previously marked deeper corrections.

Santiment flagged lower trading volumes relative to July despite August's new highs, alongside a surge in retail activity — a mix often associated with local tops.

As such, some researchers argue the recent rally in Bitcoin may be more about currency weakness than genuine inflows.

“Bitcoin's recent records may be a consequence of the dollar's depreciation rather than a reflection of real value growth,” noted a report from Presto Research earlier in the week. “With this calculation, the BTC rate will be lower than the 2021 peaks and the levels after the 2024 elections.”

With Powell's Jackson Hole comments set to frame September's meeting, traders are bracing for volatility. A dovish tilt could trigger relief rallies across the crypto market, but any hesitation on rate cuts risks accelerating the slide toward $100,000.

How to Decode a Hurricane Forecast

Hurricane forecasts feature a “cone of uncertainty,” but what is it actually showing? Scientific American breaks it down for you

By Andrea Thompson

If you've ever taken even a cursory glance at a hurricane forecast, you've seen some version of the “cone of uncertainty.” It sounds like some other-dimensional realm of indecision, but it's a mainstay for communicating hurricane forecasts. Though these maps pack in plenty of valuable information, it can be a bit tricky to interpret them if you don't know exactly what you're looking at.

Here Scientific American walks you through all the forecast components and what they mean—and, almost as crucially, what they don't. We also point you to some other resources that are often the most helpful for those staring down an approaching storm.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

National Hurricane Center

Above is an example of what you might see if you visit the National Hurricane Center's (NHC's) website during a storm in progress—in this case it's an archived forecast from 2024's Hurricane Milton. Various broadcasters, news sites and other groups that cover the weather often have their own versions of this map. There's a lot happening here, so let's break things down piece by piece.

National Hurricane Center (base map); Amanda Montañez (hurricane timeline graphics)

First off, because the cone-of-uncertainty graphic is a depiction of a forecast, it's looking into the future. Each update to the map shows the storm's current location, then roughly where the center of the storm will be over the next three to five days (depending on which version you are looking at).

National Hurricane Center (base map); Amanda Montañez (hurricane path graphics)

This is the centerpiece of the graphic—the actual cone of uncertainty—so called because it is an indicator of the possible error range in that forecast of where a tropical storm or hurricane is headed.

The first key point in understanding the cone is that the error isn't based on the specific storm forecast; rather, it's an average of the overall forecast error over the past five years. So the more forecasts improve, the narrower the cone gets. The cone gets its shape because “the uncertainty increases with time,” says Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. It's easier to forecast the near future than several days out.

And because the error is based on that long-term forecast average, “you get the exact same cone all year long for every storm,” McNoldy says. It can appear different—for example, more squat or elongated—because of how fast or slow the storm is going.

The cone is meant to encompass where a storm actually goes two thirds of the time, so “the cone is designed to fail one third of the time,” says James Franklin, former chief of the NHC's Hurricane Specialist Unit. So two thirds of the time, the storm will follow some path within the cone, but about one third of the time, its center will venture outside of the cone as the storm progresses. This is one reason why you never want to assume that because you're just outside of the cone, you're in the clear.

Brian McNoldy/NOAA

The other reason is that the cone only tracks the path of the storm's center—it does not mean the storm's impacts are limited to the area of the cone. “It isn't accounting for how big the storm is,” or if a storm's winds and rains are concentrated on one side, says Kim Wood, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Arizona. “It really makes no sense to look at the cone, see that you're outside of it and then ignore everything else,” Franklin says.

National Hurricane Center (base map); Amanda Montañez (hurricane strength graphics)

The map also includes the expected form of the storm at various points in the future, which are denoted with black or white circles and letters. The letters show whether a storm will be a tropical depression (D), tropical storm (S), hurricane (H) or major hurricane (M). (A major hurricane is a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale.)

A black circle means the storm is a tropical cyclone, or one that derives its strength from heat-driven convection at its core. A white circle denotes a potential tropical cyclone (one that could become a tropical cyclone) or a former one—often a storm that is now extratropical, meaning it is driven more by a temperature difference across a weather front than by convection.

There are also color-coded indicators of hurricane and tropical storm watches and warnings.

But these indicators are only based on a storm's wind speeds—they don't suggest anything about potential storm surge, rainfall or tornadoes, all of which can be threats from tropical cyclones.

NHC forecasts—including the cone of uncertainty graphic—are useful, but they are intended mostly for other meteorologists and emergency managers that use that information to make more detailed local forecasts and decisions about where people should evacuate or position supplies. “The NHC is not issuing information for a person,” Wood says.

Some researchers have explored making versions of the cone that are more useful for communicating threats. A 2019 study found that people estimated more damage from a hurricane when a forecast track went over a location than when it didn't. The researchers suggested that forecasts should show more hurricane paths to convey the uncertainty in where a hurricane would go.

Amanda Montañez

The graphic above is an example of such a visualization. It shows that the forecast is more certain in the near future and that paths at the outside of the cone are less likely than those at the center—but still possible.

The cone graphic as it exists now can still be useful when looking out four or more days before a storm might arrive to get a general sense of where it is now and where it is going—for example, if a storm in the Gulf of Mexico looks likely to curve into Florida, people in New Orleans may not need to be as alert. “It can be a decent starting point in just getting oriented into what the threat might be,” Franklin says. “It's a good place to start, but you don't want to stop there.”

So where should you go for more useful hurricane information? Paying attention to a trusted local weather source, such as your local National Weather Service office, is generally the best bet for keeping up with impacts specific to your area and what steps need to be taken, such as whether to evacuate.

The NHC also has maps that show when tropical-storm- and hurricane-force winds are likely to arrive at given locations and detailed maps showing expected storm surge levels. Much of this information is pulled together on the National Weather Service's Hurricane Threats and Impacts Tool, as well. This interactive map overlays the cone of a storm on top of wind, tornado, storm surge and rain threat information. You can click a given location and it will tell you what hazards you need to be concerned about.

One of the most important things to remember no matter what forecast you're looking at is that forecasts change. Small variations in the storm itself or the larger atmospheric patterns can shift a storm's path or intensity.

Human brains can naturally fall prey to the “anchoring effect”—we can become mentally rooted in one specific forecast and base our decisions on it rather than updating our thinking as conditions change. Maybe there's a particularly ominous forecast or a particularly good one for your location, “and then you don't keep looking for updates,” McNoldy says. But checking for updates is crucial to get ready for the coming storm.

How far apart are the poles? Here's the answer.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Tech companies are famous for having some of the world's most challenging and competitive interview processes. 

That's one reason why rumors tend to swirl around what it takes to get hired at giants like Facebook, Google, or Amazon. According to internet lore, you don't always just have to be prepared to tell a recruiter about your last big win, or your biggest mistake, or where you see yourself in five years. If the rumors are true, you might just have to be ready to answer a challenging math problem on the spot. 

A viral YouTube video claims that a prospective employee encountered one such problem during an Amazon job interview for software engineers and developers. It went like this:

A cable of 80 meters is hanging from the top of two poles that are both 50 meters off the ground. What is the distance between the two poles—to one decimal point—if the center cable is: 20 meters off the ground and 10 meters off the ground.

Turns out, it's a problem that can be traced back to at least one place, if not Amazon: a 2010 paper in the Atlantic Electronic Journal of Mathematics.  

If digging through an obscure academic journal isn't exactly your idea of a fun night, fear not: the YouTubers behind the channel MindYourDecisions do a great job of breaking down how to solve the problem and reach the correct answer. Now, you can get back to worrying about other things, like where you see yourself in five years. 

Watch the video here, and then, if you're feeling spicy, try your hand at these 10 impossible math problems.

Ubiquitin is a small, highly conserved protein that acts as a posttranslational modification in eukaryotes. Ubiquitination of proteins frequently serves as a degradation signal, marking them for disposal by the proteasome. Here we report a novel small molecule from a diversity-oriented synthesis library, BRD1732, that is directly ubiquitinated in cells, resulting in dramatic accumulation of inactive ubiquitin monomers and polyubiquitin chains, which causes broad inhibition of the ubiquitin–proteasome system. Ubiquitination of BRD1732 and its associated cytotoxicity are stereospecific and dependent on two homologous E3 ubiquitin ligases, RNF19A and RNF19B, and their shared E2 conjugating enzyme, UBE2L3. Our finding opens the possibility for indirect ubiquitination of a target through a ubiquitinated bifunctional small molecule and more broadly raises the potential for posttranslational modification in trans.

Until recently, the bulk of small-molecule development efforts largely focused on planar molecules having high sp2 hybridization1, which might not optimally capitalize on the three-dimensional complexity or stereospecificity of biological macromolecules. Diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) produces small-molecule libraries whose members have diverse stereochemistry and three-dimensional skeletons. This has yielded novel chemical probes with diverse targets and functions2,3. An innovative use of these libraries is to identify small molecules with entirely new modes of action within the cell through mechanistic studies of molecules with interesting phenotypes.

Mechanism-of-action (MOA) studies of small molecules have repeatedly led to important biological advances and entirely new avenues for drug development. MOA studies of the immunosuppressant natural products cyclosporin A and FK506 revealed for the first time that small molecules can function as molecular glues by inducing protein–protein interactions4. Mechanistic studies revealed that the myeloma drug lenalidomide functions as a molecular glue degrader, co-opting the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and promoting ubiquitination and degradation of two zinc finger transcription factors, IKZF1 and IKZF3, by inducing their association with the E3 ubiquitin ligase cereblon5,6. The discovery of molecular glue degraders has led to extensive efforts to understand and harness the UPS for therapeutic applications. While many tools and drugs have been developed to modulate the UPS, none act at the level of ubiquitin itself.

The ubiquitination cascade consists of activation of ubiquitin by an E1 enzyme, transfer to an E2 conjugating enzyme and ultimately conjugation of ubiquitin to a substrate in a reaction mediated by an E3 ligase. Until recently, ubiquitination was thought to occur exclusively on protein substrates. However, recent studies have demonstrated ubiquitination of some nonprotein substrates, including lipids and sugars7,8. Here, we report identification of a synthetic small molecule, BRD1732, that is directly ubiquitinated in cells, dependent on a pair of E3 ubiquitin ligases, RNF19A and RNF19B, and their shared E2 conjugating enzyme, UBE2L3. Ubiquitination of BRD1732 results in a covalent linkage between the C terminus of ubiquitin and a secondary amine on BRD1732. The resulting ubiquitin–BRD1732 conjugate accumulates dramatically in cells. In addition, we demonstrate accumulation of diubiquitin–BRD1732 conjugates assembled through noncanonical K27 ubiquitin–ubiquitin linkage, a rare and poorly characterized linkage type9,10. Likely through pleotropic effects on the UPS, ubiquitination of BRD1732 leads to inhibition of ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation.

We identified the azetidine scaffold exemplified by BRD1732 (1) from a DOS library as having stereospecific activity across multiple phenotypic screens. BRD1732 is broadly cytotoxic in cancer and immortalized cell lines, irrespective of lineage, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of approximately 1–3 µM and this effect is exclusive to the (2S,3R,4R) stereoisomer, meaning that altering one or more stereocenters on BRD1732 dramatically reduces activity (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1)11. Compared to BRD1732, both its enantiomer BRD-E (2) and a diastereomer BRD-D (3) are 10–40-fold less potent in viability assays across multiple cell lines. Our finding that activity depends on the three-dimensional orientation of the substituents on BRD1732 suggested to us that this molecule acts through direct interaction with one or more macromolecules.

Data are shown as mean ± s.d. of n = 6 biological replicates (n = 9 for WT and DKO) representing at least 2 independent experiments.

To identify the molecular machinery required for the cytotoxicity of BRD1732, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9 resistance screen (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Data 1). Single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting RNF19A, RNF19B and UBE2L3 were significantly enriched following BRD1732 treatment, suggesting that loss of these genes confers resistance. RNF19A and RNF19B are homologous RING-in-between-RING (RBR) E3 ubiquitin ligases and UBE2L3 is an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme responsible for charging the RNF19 proteins with ubiquitin12. Using the PRISM platform13 to profile the dependency features of BRD1732 across ~580 cancer cell lines, we identified RNF19A expression as a feature strongly associated with sensitivity to BRD1732 (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Data 2). Mean proliferation IC50 was 1.3 µM (95% confidence interval: 0.21–4.3 µM) across all cell lines. Taken together, the bidirectional findings from CRISPR screening and PRISM profiling strongly support a central role of RNF19A/B in the cytotoxicity of BRD1732. To validate these findings, we used CRISPR–Cas9 to generate single-knockout (KO) (RNF19A, RNF19B and UBE2L3) and double-KO (DKO) (RNF19A and RNF19B) clones from the haploid cell line HAP1. KO of either RNF19A or RNF19B resulted in a 2–3-fold reduction in potency of BRD1732 in viability assays (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2). KO of UBE2L3 or DKO of RNF19A and RNF19B resulted in a ~10-fold reduction in potency of BRD1732.

While further interrogating the effects of BRD1732 on the UPS, we made the unexpected discovery that treatment of cells with BRD1732 causes accumulation of monoubiquitin and diubiquitin species along with a very small but reproducible gel shift for monoubiquitin (Fig. 2a). This effect is even more prominent on 12% Bis–Tris polyacrylamide gel. We reasoned that this could indicate a change in posttranslational modification of ubiquitin or conjugation of ubiquitin to a small molecule or metabolite. BRD1732-induced accumulation of ubiquitin species is even more pronounced in cells overexpressing RNF19A (Supplementary Fig. 3); thus, we purified endogenous ubiquitin from RNF19A-overexpressing Expi293F cells either untreated or treated with 10 µM BRD1732 for 6 h. We then purified these ubiquitin samples by cation exchange followed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and analyzed them by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) (Fig. 2b). The mass of endogenous ubiquitin from untreated cells matches the calculated mass for unmodified ubiquitin (8,565 Da). However, the mass of ubiquitin from BRD1732-treated cells is 387 Da greater, which exactly matches the predicted mass of a covalent adduct between ubiquitin and BRD1732 with loss of water (8,952 Da).

Ubiquitin is transferred to substrate lysine residues by formation of an isopeptide bond between the C terminus of ubiquitin and the ε-amine of lysine resulting in loss of a water molecule (Fig. 2c)14. Given that BRD1732 contains a free aliphatic amine like lysine, we suspected that BRD1732 was mimicking a substrate protein and undergoing direct ubiquitination (Fig. 2d). To further characterize the ubiquitin conjugate formed in cells, we performed trypsin digestion under nondenaturing conditions. Digestion of unmodified ubiquitin under these conditions results in a single cleavage after R74 to yield ubiquitin(1–74), as previously reported15, with a mass of 8,452 Da by LC–MS (Supplementary Fig. 4). Similar trypsin digestion of the BRD1732-induced ubiquitin conjugate yielded ubiquitin(1–74) and a new fragment ion at m/z = 519, which corresponds to the predicted mass of Gly-Gly-BRD1732 ([M + H]+ = 519 Da). Further fragmentation of this 519 ion yielded BRD1732 ([M + H]+ = 405) and its expected fragmentation ions (Fig. 2d).

The only two potential sites of ubiquitination on BRD1732 are the primary alcohol or the azetidine nitrogen, a secondary amine. To identify the site of ubiquitination, we synthesized three analogs of BRD1732 in which one or both of these sites was modified by a methyl group, chemically inactivating them (Fig. 3a). As we expected, methylation of the primary alcohol alone BRD-OMe (4) had no effect on formation of ubiquitin conjugates in cells (Fig. 3b) and no notable effect on the IC50 in proliferation assays (Fig. 3c). Conversely, methylation of the azetidine nitrogen alone BRD-NMe (5) or in combination with the primary alcohol BRD-NOMe (6) completely prevented accumulation of ubiquitin–BRD1732 conjugates and increased the IC50 to >30 µM. Taken together, these results demonstrate that BRD1732 is directly ubiquitinated in cells by formation of an amide bond between the ubiquitin C terminus and the azetidine secondary amine.

BRD1732–ubiquitin conjugate accumulation is concentration dependent and stereospecific (Fig. 4a,b). To understand whether this accumulation of ubiquitin species is dependent on RNF19 proteins, we performed immunoblot analysis in wild-type (WT) and KO HAP1 cell lines (Fig. 4b,c). KO of either RNF19A or RNF19B decreased formation of these ubiquitin species and DKO of these genes had an even more dramatic effect (Fig. 4b). Similarly, KO of UBE2L3 greatly reduced the accumulation of both monoubiquitin and diubiquitin species (Fig. 4c). Exogenous stable overexpression of GFP–RNF19A or GFP–RNF19B in DKO (19AKO;19BKO) HAP1 or DKO HEK293T cells resulted in recovery of BRD1732 ubiquitination (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 5). We also note a dramatic increase in RNF19A and RNF19B levels upon treatment with BRD1732, consistent with stabilization of these proteins by BRD1732. RBR E3 ligases require transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 enzyme to a catalytic cysteine in the E3 RING2 domain before transfer to a substrate16. Importantly, BRD1732-induced accumulation of ubiquitin requires the RBR core of RNF19A (RING1-IBR-RING2), including the catalytic C316 and at least one of its two transmembrane domains but does not require the N-terminal extension or the C-terminal regulatory domain as demonstrated by exogenous overexpression of mutants of RNF19A in 19AKO;19BKO HEK293T cells (Fig. 4f). Based on these findings, we conclude that BRD1732 is ubiquitinated in cells in a manner that is dependent upon the E3 ligases RNF19A and RNF19B and their shared E2 enzyme UBE2L3 (Fig. 4g).

Following purification of endogenous ubiquitin from BRD1732-treated cells, we exclusively detect the ubiquitin–BRD1732 conjugate by LC–MS. Therefore, we wondered whether BRD1732 treatment might interfere with ubiquitin homeostasis in the cell. Indeed, treatment of WT HEK293T or KP4 cells with BRD1732 caused concentration-dependent loss of histone H2A-K119 ubiquitination, potentially consistent with depletion of nuclear ubiquitin (Fig. 5a). Because loss of H2A-K119 ubiquitination can also indicate more general ubiquitin-related stress, we directly quantified free monoubiquitin by flow cytometry staining with HA–tUI (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 6)17. HA–tUI is a tagged synthetic protein designed to bind free ubiquitin with high affinity (dissociation constant 66 pM) and high specificity. Using this method, HEK293T cells treated with BRD1732 showed a slight decrease in free ubiquitin compared to DMSO-treated cells. However, we note that this effect does not show a clear dose response. In addition, exogenous overexpression of ubiquitin does not significantly alter the IC50 for BRD1732 in cell viability assays (Supplementary Fig. 7). Thus, despite noting dramatic accumulation of ubiquitin–BRD1732 conjugates in cells, we do not see evidence that cellular ubiquitin stores are depleted upon treatment with BRD1732 and exogenous overexpression of ubiquitin does not confer resistance to BRD1732. Taken together these effects do not adequately explain the toxicity of BRD1732.

The adenosine monophosphate mimetic ubiquitin-activating enzyme (UAE) inhibitor MLN7243 conjugates to the C terminus of ubiquitin within the UAE active site18. The resulting ubiquitin–MLN7243 conjugate potently inhibits the UAE itself. Given the broad requirement of UAE for ubiquitination within the cell, MLN7243 treatment results in depletion of all conjugated and unconjugated ubiquitin species with the exception of free monoubiquitin (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 8). As expected, charging of E2 enzymes by UAE is also prevented by MLN7243. In contrast, BRD1732 only partially blocks UAE activity as indicated by ubiquitin charging of the E2 enzymes UBE2T, UBE2A/2B and UBE2L3, and BRD1732 has minimal effect on high-molecular-weight polyubiquitin conjugates at concentrations of up to 10 μM (Fig. 5c). These results are consistent with BRD1732 having a mechanism that is distinct from the UAE inhibitor MLN7243.

The terminal diglycine of ubiquitin is required for activation by ubiquitin ligases, conjugation to substrate proteins and removal by deubiquitinases15,19,20. In neurodegenerative diseases, molecular misreading results in a frameshift mutation in the ubiquitin B (UBB) gene resulting in production of an aberrant form of ubiquitin with G76 replaced by a 20-aa extension (Fig. 5d)21. Unanchored polyubiquitin chains terminating in UBB+1 have been reported to inhibit proteasomal degradation in cells and we wondered whether ubiquitin–BRD1732 conjugates could behave similarly22. While treatment with BRD1732 induced accumulation of multiple proteins known to undergo rapid proteasomal degradation, including Mcl1, Nrf1, p21 and p27, these proteins were not stabilized by overexpression of myc-tagged UBB+1 (Fig. 5e). Given the striking effects on these proteins, we wondered whether BRD1732 might be disrupting the UPS more broadly.

To assess the effect of BRD1732 on protein homeostasis in cells, we performed quantitative proteomics comparing BRD1732 to a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, in Yamato synovial sarcoma cells (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Data 3 and 4). Focusing on proteins with no significant gene expression changes upon treatment by RNA-seq (log2FC (fold change) < 1, Padj < 0.01), we identified 138 proteins that were stabilized by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and only two proteins that were destabilized. In contrast, BRD1732 induced dramatic bidirectional changes in protein stability, with 225 proteins significantly increased and 94 proteins significantly decreased. Strikingly, 63 proteins were stabilized by both BRD1732 and MG132. Our RNA-seq data demonstrate that these changes are not transcriptionally driven but rather occur at the protein level.

a, Yamato synovial sarcoma cells were treated with 5 µM BRD1732 or 5 µM MG132 for 24 h and then analyzed by TMT quantitative proteomics. Plot shows only proteins with no significant change in corresponding gene expression by RNA-seq.

To facilitate broader comparison to 877 drugs and tool compounds reported as part of DeepCoverMOA23, we performed similar quantitative proteomics in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells following treatment with BRD1732. Across this panel of molecules with a wide range of MOAs, BRD1732-induced protein-level changes correlated most strongly with the proteasome inhibitors MG132, epoxomicin and ONX-0941 (Pearson r = 0.4–0.43) and the NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor MLN4924 (r = 0.48) (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Data 5). Restricting this analysis to proteins that increase upon treatment with BRD1732, we found that the correlation with proteasome inhibitors strengthened (r = 0.58–0.6).

Further analysis of our Yamato cell proteomics data revealed an increase in ubiquitin–ubiquitin linkages upon treatment with BRD1732, similar to changes seen with proteasome inhibition (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 9). Strikingly, however, BRD1732 induced dramatic accumulation of K27-bridged ubiquitin linkages. While BRD1732 and MG132 showed similarities at the proteome level, they differed in their effects on ubiquitin. Unlike BRD1732, MG132 did not induce accumulation of low-molecular-weight polyubiquitin chains but rather led to accumulation of high-molecular-weight polyubiquitinated substrate proteins (Extended Data Fig. 1a). In contrast, BRD1732 showed a bimodal effect on polyubiquitinated species, first increasing like MG132 and then decreasing with a more dramatic rise in low-molecular-weight ubiquitin conjugates. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that BRD1732-induced diubiquitin species contained the uncommon K27 ubiquitin linkage. Accumulation of this species correlated closely with accumulation of several proteins that were also stabilized by MG132, including p21, p27, p53, Nrf1 and Mcl1 (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Using cycloheximide chase experiments, we confirmed that the accumulation of these proteins resulted from prolongation of their half-lives (Extended Data Fig. 1b).

We wondered whether the BRD1732-induced K27-linked diubiquitin species might form as a conjugate on BRD1732. Using an alkyne-modified BRD1732 analog, BRD-alkyne (7), and subjecting lysate from treated cells to a click reaction with biotin-azide before immunoblot analysis, we discovered that K27-linked diubiquitin species were indeed conjugated to BRD1732 (Fig. 6d). After biotin-azide click, diubiquitin species in BRD-alkyne treated cells shifted higher corresponding to the added mass of biotin-azide. Following pulldown with streptavidin beads, immunoblot analyses demonstrated that both monoubiquitin and K27-linked diubiquitin were covalently conjugated to BRD1732.

To further characterize the effect of BRD1732 on ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation, we evaluated its effect on lenalidomide-induced degradation of IKZF3 using a fluorescent reporter system consisting of IKZF3-GFP expressed under the SFFV promoter and mCherry expressed from an internal ribosome entry site, developed by Dr Benjamin Ebert. Lenalidomide induces ubiquitination and degradation of IKZF3 by the E3 ubiquitin ligase cereblon5. Using our reporter system, we see loss of GFP signal upon treatment with lenalidomide corresponding to degradation of IKZF3, and co-treatment with MG132 blocks this effect. While simultaneous co-treatment with BRD1732 only minimally affected IKZF3 degradation by lenalidomide, pretreatment with BRD1732 for 6 h robustly blocked degradation (Fig. 6e and Extended Data Fig. 1c). To assess the effect of BRD1732 on proteasomal degradation in an endogenous system, we evaluated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced degradation of inhibitor of kappa B alpha (IκBα) (Fig. 6f and Supplementary Fig. 10). Following 6-h pretreatment, BRD1732 efficiently blocked degradation of IκBα following stimulation with TNF. Importantly, we saw evidence of intact IκBα phosphorylation and polyubiquitination, the two proximal signals for proteasomal degradation of IκBα, suggesting that BRD1732 interfered with degradation at the level of the proteasome itself (Supplementary Fig. 10). As expected, cells lacking expression of one or both RNF19 proteins showed reduced production of the ubiquitin–BRD1732 conjugate and less inhibition of IκBα degradation.

In considering the bidirectional effects of BRD1732 in our proteomic analysis, we wondered whether BRD1732 might block ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation while leaving ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation intact (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Indeed, we saw no stabilization of ornithine decarboxylase, a classic substrate for ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation because of its strong PEST sequence24. In addition, BRD1732 induced loss of two homologous zinc finger proteins, ZFAND5 and ZFAND6, and this effect was blocked by co-treatment with MG132 but not MLN7243, consistent with ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Like other cellular effects of BRD1732, degradation of ZFAND5 and ZFAND6 is dependent on RNF19 proteins (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Further studies to understand the mechanism of degradation of ZFAND5 and ZFAND6 by BRD1732 are underway. Together our results are consistent with a model in which BRD1732 is ubiquitinated by UBE2L3 and RNF19 proteins and accumulation of the resulting ubiquitin–BRD1732 conjugate leads to inhibition of ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation (Fig. 6g).

Small-molecule MOA studies have repeatedly helped to lay the groundwork for new fields of drug discovery. However, even when a target can be identified, achieving a deep understanding of a small molecule's mechanism remains a considerable challenge. Powerful modern tools such as genome-wide CRISPR screening can be illuminating but these are inadequate for unveiling the details of a chemical mechanism, which is still only achievable through highly tailored biochemical studies.

Here, we used a combination of CRISPR screening, proteomics and classical biochemistry to uncover a previously unknown small-molecule MOA wherein BRD1732 receives a protein modification, ubiquitin, that is thought to serve almost exclusively as a posttranslational modification on other proteins. Nearly all known covalent small-molecule probes and drugs contain reactive electrophiles to allow covalent modification of nucleophilic amino acids, such as cysteine, serine or tyrosine, on their protein targets. There, the reactive moiety resides within the small molecule. For BRD1732, the directionality of the reaction is reversed. BRD1732 contains a relatively unreactive nucleophile, the azetidine nitrogen, which forms a covalent bond with the C terminus of ubiquitin. In this case, the reactive electrophile is the thioester bond between the ubiquitin C terminus and the catalytic cysteine of the ubiquitin ligase. Even more surprisingly, the ubiquitinated azetidine nitrogen is a secondary amine, unlike the primary amine of lysine side chains.

Nucleotide-mimetic inhibitors of E1 enzymes MLN7243 and MLN4924 also form covalent conjugates with the C terminus of ubiquitin and NEDD8, respectively. However, while these molecules function through product inhibition blocking the continued production of conjugate, the ubiquitin–BRD1732 conjugate rapidly accumulates in cells, suggesting efficient turnover. Despite this dramatic accumulation, we do not see evidence that cellular free ubiquitin stores are depleted upon treatment with BRD1732. Given the wide-ranging functions and interactors of ubiquitin in the cell, it is unsurprising that BRD1732 shows pleiotropic effects culminating in disruption of the UPS and proteasomal degradation.

In addition, we find that ubiquitin–BRD1732 conjugates consist of a combination of monoubiquitinated and diubiquitinated species and these diubiquitin species are predominantly assembled through the atypical K27 linkage. Unlike the canonical K48-linked ubiquitin chains, which typically serve as direct signals for proteasomal degradation, K27-linked ubiquitin chains are less common and are reported to have a role in p97 substrate processing of nuclear proteins and nonproteolytic signaling pathways25,26,27. Diubiquitin linked through K27 is also stable to most deubiquitinases, a feature that may account for its accumulation in BRD1732-treated cells10,28. Together, while BRD1732 shows similarity with active site proteasome inhibitors at the transcriptional and proteomic level, BRD1732 functions through a distinct mechanism and is unique in causing widespread bidirectional effects on protein homeostasis.

Ubiquitination of BRD1732 is both highly stereospecific and highly dependent on expression of RNF19 proteins. While we have been unable to reconstitute ubiquitination of BRD1732 by RNF19 with recombinant proteins despite multiple attempts, on the basis of our CRISPR–Cas9 KO and subsequent re-expression experiments, it is highly likely that RNF19 proteins are directly responsible for ubiquitination of BRD1732. Ubiquitination of nonproteinaceous substrates has only rarely been reported, notably with ubiquitination of lipopolysaccharide by RNF213 upon entry of Salmonella into the cytosol7. Our demonstration of ubiquitination of a small molecule in cells raises the possibility of noncovalently directing ubiquitin to any protein target using bifunctional compounds related to BRD1732 within the cell. Indeed, our work more generally raises the possibility of posttranslational modification in trans, the delivery of a posttranslational mark through a small-molecule intermediary.

Yamato synovial sarcoma cells were plated in 10-cm dishes at a density of 2 × 106 cells per ml and allowed to grow for 48 h or until 75% confluency was reached. These cells were treated with BRD1732 at 1 or 5 μM, MG132 at 5 μM or DMSO for 24 h at a final DMSO concentration of 1% v/v. Cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 200 μl of radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM DTT and cOmplete protease inhibitors (Roche)). Protein concentrations were measured using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Data were acquired using Xcalibur version 4.2 and analyzed as previously described29. Briefly, a 0.003-Da window centered on each reporter ion's theoretical m/z was used to record the closest intensity signal. Tandem mass tag (TMT) signals were corrected for isotope impurities per manufacturer's instructions. Peptides were quantifiable only if total signal-to-noise across channels exceeded 200 and isolation specificity was >0.75. Peptide intensities were summed and normalized across channels. Protein quantitation was based on summed peptide signal-to-noise, scaled to 100. The adjusted P value was calculated by Student's t-test followed by Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. Proteomic datasets were processed to remove proteins with expression changes by RNA-seq (|log2FC| > 1 and −log10(Padj) > 2, where Padj is the Benjamini–Hochberg-corrected P value). Resulting datasets for 5 µM BRD1732 and 5 µM MG132 were compared to identify proteins with log2FC > 1.5 and −log10(Padj) > 2. Plots were generated with GraphPad Prism.

Ebert lab) were also transduced with a pool of lentiviral particles for ~70,000 sgRNAs (Brunello library), targeting exons of ~20,000 genes (plus nontargeting control sgRNAs), under conditions of transduction that allow for an average of no more than one sgRNA to be incorporated in a given cell33. The MM.1S-Cas9+ Brunello-transduced cells were then cultured in the presence or absence of increasing doses of BRD1732 (0.5–4 µM). The treated versus control cultures of MM.1S cells were passaged serially over 10 weeks and were periodically checked for BRD1732 sensitivity using CTG. When the dose–response curve identified the isolation of BRD1732-resistant MM cells, these were isolated from the cultures and processed for sequencing. Data were analyzed with the MAGeCK package using default parameters.

HCT116 cells were plated in six-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cell per well. After attachment for 24 h, cells were treated with 5 µM BRD1732 for 1, 2, 4 or 24 h or 0.5% (v/v) DMSO for 24 h. Cells were then washed with PBS three times and lysed with 8 M urea, 0.1% SDS and 200 mM EPPS buffer pH 8.5 containing cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche) and PhosSTOP (Roche). Samples were processed as previously described23 but using 16-plex TMTpro reagents. Briefly, 30 μg of protein was reduced with TCEP (5 mM, 15 min), alkylated with iodoacetamide (20 mM, 30 min) and then extracted using single-pot, solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation technology. Proteins were digested overnight at 37 °C using 0.3 μg of LysC (Wako) and 0.3 μg of trypsin (Thermo) before TMT labeling. TMT-labeled peptides were pooled then desalted using a 50-mg SepPak (Waters) before offline basic pH reverse-phase HPLC fractionation, generating 24 fractions. A total of 12 nonadjacent fractions were desalted using in-housed packed stagetips and then analyzed using a real-time search MS3 method. The adjusted P value was calculated by Student's t-test followed by Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. Plots were generated using GraphPad Prism. Data corresponding to the log2FC from the 24-h time point were subjected to comparative analysis by DeepCoverMOA (http://wren.hms.harvard.edu/DeepCoverMOA/)23. When limiting analysis to proteins that increase upon treatment with BRD1732, data for proteins with log2FC < 0 were removed and the remaining data were subjected to analysis by DeepCoverMOA. Networks were generated using Cytoscape.

Cells were plated into a 12-well plate (Costar, 3513) with 100,000 cells per well (final volume: 1 ml) and incubated overnight. Cells at 40–60% confluency were treated with compounds or 0.5% (v/v) DMSO. After drug treatment for indicated times, cells were lysed in CelLytic M (Sigma-Aldrich) reagent supplemented with 1× EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Sigma-Aldrich) for 40 min on a rotating wheel at 4 °C. Lysates were separated on 4–12% Bis–Tris SDS–PAGE (Invitrogen) in MES buffer (Invitrogen) at 150 V for 45 min. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane using dry transfer method with iBlot 2 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The membrane was blocked with 5% BSA (RPI) in TBST buffer at room temperature for 1 h followed by incubation with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight, followed by secondary antibody incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoblots were then imaged by using a Li-Cor Odyssey CLx imaging system with Image Studio 5.0 software. All antibodies are listed at the end of the section.

PRISM profiling was performed as previously described34. The PRISM cell set used consisted of 483 solid tumor cancer cell lines. These cell lines largely overlap with and reflect the diversity of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia cell lines (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle). Cell lines were grown in RPMI with 10% FBS without phenol red. Parental cell lines were stably infected with a unique 24-nt DNA barcode by lentiviral transduction and blasticidin selection. After selection, barcoded cell lines were expanded and quality-checked (Mycoplasma contamination test, a sinle-nucleotide polymorphism test for confirming cell line identity and barcode confirmation). Passing barcoded lines were then pooled (20–25 cell lines per pool) on the basis of doubling time and frozen in assay-ready vials. A Labcyte Echo was used to acoustically transfer test compounds were to 384-well plates at eight doses with threefold dilutions in triplicate. These assay-ready plates were then seeded with the thawed cell line pools. Adherent cell pools were plated at 1,250 cells per well. Treated cells were incubated for 5 days then lysed with QIagne TCL buffer and frozen. Lysate plates were collapsed together before barcode amplification and detection. Each cell line's unique barcode was located at the end of the blasticidin resistance gene and was expressed as mRNA. These mRNAs were then captured using magnetic particles that recognize poly(A) sequences. mRNA was then reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA and then the sequence containing the unique PRISM barcode was amplified using PCR. Finally, Luminex beads that recognize the specific barcode sequences in the cell set were hybridized to the PCR products and then detected using a Luminex scanner that reports signal as a median fluorescence intensity.

Ubiquitin–BRD1732 conjugate was prepared as follows. Expi293T cells were grown in 125-ml shaker flasks at 37 °C and 8% CO2. Cells were transiently transfected with pLVX6 RNF19A using the ExpiFectamine 293 transfection kit following the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation overnight, the medium was exchanged to Expi293 expression medium containing 10 µM BRD1732 and cells were incubated for 6 h. The cell stock was then resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM ammonium chloride, pH 6.0) supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Sigma-Aldrich) and lysed by sonication. The sample were then centrifuged at 20,199g for 30 min at 4 °C using JA-25.50 rotor. The supernatant was collected and filtered using a 0.45-µm filter (Millex) before loading on a 1-ml HiTrap Q HP column (Cytiva) using fast protein LC (FPLC) on ÄKTA pure (Cytiva). Ubiquitin–BRD1732 conjugates were eluted with a salt gradient from 0 to 1 M NaCl in lysis buffer. The pooled protein sample was further purified by SEC using a Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 GL (Cytiva) column in PBS buffer. In comparison, WT ubiquitin was purified from Expi293T cells using the abovementioned method except for the steps of pLVX6 plasmid transfection and BRD1732 treatment.

HA–tUI protein was purified as previously described17. Briefly, HA–tUI protein cloned on pET28 (Addgene, 122662) was transformed into BL21 (DE3) Star II Escherichia coli (QB3-Berkeley) for protein expression. The expression was induced by adding 0.4 mM IPTG to cells grown at 37 °C until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6 to 0.8. After a 30-min ice bath, the cells were left to grow at 20 °C overnight. The cells were then centrifuged at 6,000g for 25 min at 4 °C. The collected pellets were resuspended in buffer A (20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole and 1 mM TCEP, pH 7.4) and sonicated for cell lysis. The lysate was further centrifuged at 20,199g for 30 min at 4 °C using a JA-25.50 rotor. The supernatant was filtered against a 0.45-µm filter (Millex) before loading on a 5-ml HisTrap HP column (Cytiva) for FPLC. The protein was eluted by the imidazole gradient from 20 mM to 500 mM in buffer A. After an overnight buffer dialysis into buffer B (PBS and 1 mM TCEP, pH 7.4) where the protein solution was held in the 3.5-kDa cutoff tubing (Spectrum Labs), protein was then purified by SEC using a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg (Cytiva) column in buffer B.

LC–MS was performed on a Xevo G2-XS quadrupole time-of-flight MS instrument coupled with an Acquity ultrahigh-performance LC (UPLC) system equipped with an Acquity UPLC protein BEH C4 column (300 Å, 1.7 µm, 2.1 mm × 50 mm). Buffer A (water supplemented with 0.1% formic acid) and buffer B (acetonitrile supplemented with 0.1% formic acid) were used as the mobile phase. The flow rate was 0.5 ml min−1. Spectra were deconvoluted and analyzed using Masslynx version 4.2 software.

FPLC–SEC-purified ubiquitin–BRD1732 conjugate in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) was trypsin-digested and analyzed by tandem MS. Briefly, purified ubiquitin–BRD1732 conjugate (~1 µM, 100 µl) in PBS was buffer exchanged into digestion buffer A (20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 2 mM CaCl2) using 0.5-ml 3-kDa-cutoff centrifugal filters (Amicon). Trypsin digestion was performed by adding 0.5 mg trypsin into the sample and incubating overnight at 37 °C. The digestion reaction was stopped by adding 5 µl of 10% formic acid to reach a final concentration of 0.5 % (v/v) formic acid. Digested peptides were characterized by a Waters Xevo G2-XS system equipped with an Acquity UPLC BEH C4 1.7-µm column using a linear gradient of 5–95% acetonitrile in water + 0.05% formic acid. Gating on the ion at m/z = 519, we applied a collision energy of 20 eV. A similar protocol for trypsin digestion and intact protein LC–MS was used for unmodified ubiquitin.

HEK293T cells were plated 200,000 cells per well in a 12-well plate and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 overnight. Drug treatments were performed by treating the cells with different concentration of BRD1732 for 6 h. Cells were detached by trypsinization using TrypLE express enzyme (Thermo Fisher) and then washed by ice-cold PBS buffer (all following PBS washes used ice-cold PBS buffer). Next, cells were fixed by incubating with 4% formaldyhyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS buffer for 15 min at room temperature, followed by a PBS wash. Cells were then permeabilized by slowly dropping ice-cold 100% methanol (Fisher Scientific) with vertexing to the final concentration of 90% methanol, followed by a 30-min incubation on ice and a PBS wash. Next, cell samples were incubated with blocking buffer (5% BSA (RPI) in TBST buffer) for 1 h to block the nonspecific binding. After that, samples were divided into two groups. The experimental group was stained with 100 nM purified HA–tUI protein in blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature to detect the free ubiquitin concentration. In the control group, purified 100 nM HA–tUI protein was mixed with 10 µM ubiquitin protein (Enzo Life Sciences) for 5 min at room temperature in blocking buffer before adding to the sample. Three PBS washes were performed with at least 5-min intervals between each. Cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-HA monoclonal antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 750 (Cell signaling) in a black box with 1:500 dilution. The next day, samples were washed three times with PBS buffer before loaded with 200 µl of PBS supplemented with 1 % BSA. Samples were then transferred to a 96-well plate and analyzed on a CytoFLEX S flow cytometer (Beckman) using CytExpert software. The results were then processed using FlowJo.

HEK293T IKZF3 cells were plated at 3 × 105 cells per well in 12-well plates. After attachment for 24 h, cells were treated with 5 µM BRD1732, 5 µM MG132 or 0.1% (v/v) DMSO for 6 h. The medium was then exchanged to include 200 nM lenalidomide with indicated compounds for an additional 2 h. Cells were detached using TrypLE Express (Thermo), resuspended in PBS with 10% (v/v) FBS, centrifuged for 2 min at 300g, resuspended in PBS with 1% (v/v) FBS and analyzed by flow cytometry on a CytoFLEX S flow cytometer. Data were processed using FlowJo (Supplementary Fig. 11). Data represent three biological replicates.

HEK293 cells were seeded in 10-cm2 dishes at 37 °C with 5% CO2 overnight before treatment with 5 μM BRD1732 or its alkyne-tagged derivative, BRD-alkyne, for 6 h. Following treatment, cells were washed with PBS, detached using TrypLE express enzyme (12604013, Thermo Fisher) and collected by centrifugation at 300g for 3 min. The cell pellet was washed once with PBS (MT21031CV, Corning), resuspended in the lysis buffer of PBS containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (78446, Thermo Fisher) and lysed by sonication. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,627g for 10 min at 4 °C. Click chemistry labeling was performed using biotin-picolyl azide in a copper(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition reaction35,36. To 47 μl of lysate, the following reagents were sequentially added in a final volume of 50 μl: 2.5 mM sodium ascorbate (11140, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 mM biotin-picolyl azide (900912, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5 mM THPTA ligand (762342, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.25 mM copper sulfate (209198, Sigma-Aldrich). The reaction mixture was vortexed, briefly spun down and incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. Excess click chemistry reagents were removed using a Zeba spin desalting column (PI89882, Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer's protocol. A portion of the sample was reserved for input immunoblots and the rest of the sample was diluted up to 300 μl with lysis buffer. Biotinylated proteins were then captured using streptavidin magnetic beads (88816, Thermo Fisher) by incubating the diluted and desalted lysate with streptavidin beads for at least 1 h at room temperature with rotation. After reservation of a portion of the supernatant for immunoblots, beads were washed extensively with TBS (BP2471, Thermo Fisher) containing 0.1% Tween-20 detergent (P1379, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. Bound proteins were eluted using 2× SDS sample buffer (J61337-AD, Thermo Scientific) and analyzed by immunoblotting.

KP4 or HEK293T cells were reverse-transfected with preformed Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) with EnGen Cas9 NLS (New England Biolabs), CRISPR RNA (crRNA) targeting RNF19B (target sequence: TCGTACTTGTGCATAAGCGG) and trans-activating crRNA (Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT)) using Lipofectamine CRISPRMAX (Thermo). Cells were allowed to attach for 24 h then were selected with 5 µM BRD1732 for 24 h to obtain RNF19B-KO cells. Following two passages, RNF19B-KO cells were similarly reverse-transfected with Cas9 RNP with crRNA targeting RNF19A (target sequence: AAGAATTTATGCTTAGACGG). Following attachment for 24 h, cells were selected with 20 µM BRD1732 for 24 h to obtain RNF19A/B-DKO cells.

CRISPR–Cas9 KO in HAP1 cell lines with single clonal selection was performed as follows. gRNA of the gene of interest was selected from a predesigned online library from IDT. We used the following sgRNA sequences:

RNF19A: AAGAATTTATGCTTAGACGG

RNF19B: CCGCTTATGCACAAGTACGA

UBE2L3: TATGATAAGGGAGCCTTCAG

The Cas9 RNP complex, containing synthesized gRNA from IDT and S.p. HiFi Cas9 (1081061, IDT), was prepared using the Neon transfection kit (MPK10025K, Thermo Fisher) following the company's protocol. The RNP complex was then delivered into cells using the Neon transfection system (MPK5000, Thermo Fisher) according to the company's protocol with some modifications. Briefly, for each transfection, 1 × 106 cells were electroporated with RNP complex (7.5 µg of gRNA + 30 µg of Cas9) in 120 µl of reaction buffer with the following settings on Neon: 1,575 V, 10 ms and three pulses. After electroporation, cells were seeded in a six-well culture plate in IMDM (Gibco) and cultured for 2 days. After transfection, single-cell clones were isolated through limiting dilution into 96-well plates (3997, Corning). Expanded single-cell clones were screened for successful KO by PCR amplification and subsequent sequencing analysis (Genewiz) of targeted genomic regions to confirm the absence or mutation of the targeted genes.

KP4 WT or RNF19B-KO cells were reverse-transfected with Silencer siRNA targeting RNF19A (134494, Thermo) or Silencer Select siRNA control (AM4611, Thermo), plating cells at 8 × 105 per well. Following attachment for 24 h, cells were treated with 5 µM BRD1732 or DMSO 0.5% (v/v) DMSO for 6 h followed by 20 ng ml−1 TNF or water in medium for 10 min. Plates were placed on ice and cells were harvested for immunoblot analysis by the addition of cold RIPA buffer.

Protein and polypeptide heteropolymers containing non-α-backbone monomers are highly desirable as potential materials and therapeutics but many remain difficult or impossible to biosynthesize in cells using traditional genetic code expansion. Here we describe a next-generation approach to such materials that relies instead on proximity-guided intramolecular rearrangements that edit the protein backbone post-translationally. This approach relies on orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes that accept α-hydroxy acid monomers whose side chains contain masked nucleophiles. Introduction of such an α-hydroxy acid into a protein translated in vivo, followed by nucleophile unmasking, sets up a thermodynamically favored intramolecular backbone extension acyl rearrangement (BEAR) reaction that edits the protein to install an extended-backbone monomer. In the examples described here, BEAR reactions are used to generate protein heteropolymers containing a β-backbone, γ-backbone or δ-backbone. This report represents a general strategy to install extended backbones into genetically encoded proteins and peptides expressed in cells.

Chiral purity is crucial in life sciences, emphasizing the importance of precise enantiomeric identification and the development of analytical techniques. Here, we design functional dyes with visual chiral recognition capabilities by introducing recognition units 2-amino-1,2-diphenylethanol into vibration-induced emission molecules. The unambiguous differentiation in luminescent colors upon binding to enantiomers facilitates the efficient recognition of enantiomers and the analysis of enantiomeric excess. The chiral recognition process originates from co-assembly under charge-aided hydrogen bonding interactions, which is significantly impacted by the steric hindrance effect, and further affects the planarization of the excited state conformation of the dye. This co-assembly process precisely amplifies the dynamics at the molecular level into macroscopic observable signals for real-time, highly sensitive recognition. Furthermore, we establish a sophisticated optical analysis system by correlating Red-Green-Blue values and CIE coordinates to analyze the enantiomeric excess of chiral molecules. This work opens a distinct avenue for visual chiral recognition and inspires the development of advanced optical materials in chiral sensing chemistry.

Chirality, a fundamental aspect of molecular structure, plays a pivotal role in various fields ranging from pharmaceuticals to materials science; therefore, the ability to discern and separate enantiomers is of paramount importance1,2,3,4,5. Luminescence-based techniques have emerged as a compelling alternative to High-performance liquid chromatography, offering the advantages of simplicity, high speed and the potential for real-time monitoring6,7,8,9,10,11. Nevertheless, the sensitivity of macroscopic measurements in chiral recognition processes is often diminished due to the influence of ensemble averaging effects. Although scientists have achieved numerous research outcomes in the field of developing chiral recognition technologies using functional dyes12,13,14,15, there remains an urgent demand for facile, rapid and sensitive chiral recognition products. The pivotal and challenging lie in exploiting the differential interactions between the dye and the enantiomers to precisely modulate the emission energy levels of dyes, thereby enabling high-sensitivity discrimination between enantiomers16,17,18.

A recent study from Tian's group indicated that a class of fluorophore exhibited the vibration-induced emission (VIE) effect19,20,21. The molecules in solution undergo an excited-state configuration transformation, inducing the effective p-conjugation thus emitting red fluorescence. While in the solid or aggregation state, the physical constraint blocked the planarization of the structure in the excited state, result in an emission of intrinsic blue light. Unlike traditional fluorophores, VIE dyes exhibit fluorescence that is dynamically modulated by changes in their microenvironment22,23. This sensitivity of the excited state allows for the amplification of subtle variations in assembly within the chiral space, rendering VIE dyes particularly suitable for chiral discrimination. Guo et al24. utilized VIE with graphene to construct a single-molecule device, enabling in situ and real-time direct observation of chirality recognition at the single-molecule level through the discrimination of electrical conductance states. However, sample pretreatment before instrumental detection and following analysis were carried out under harsh conditions. Here, we were committed to accurately amplify the microscale dynamic variations at the single-molecule level to a macroscopic state that is perceptible to the unaided eye, thereby facilitating real-time, highly sensitive, and visual chirality discrimination.

Hence, we designed and synthesized functional materials with visual chiral recognition capabilities by introducing recognition units 2-Amino-1,2-Diphenylethanol into VIE molecules. As shown in Fig. 1, by utilizing the selective co-assembly mechanism between the dyes and chiral small molecules, we precisely modulated the excited-state conformation of VIE dyes under assembly conditions. The differentiation in luminescent color enabled the recognition of enantiomers and the analysis of enantiomeric excess. Additionally, by employing digital photography and handheld optical detector for the quantification Red-Green-Blue (RGB) values and CIE coordinates with the enantiomeric excess, thereby establishing an optical display system for analyzing the enantiomeric excess of chiral small molecules.

a Structures of chiral molecules (1S,2 R)- and (1 R,2S)-DPAC. b Schematic representation of the visualization of enantiorecognition.

The chiral color indicator was obtained by introducing chiral recognition auxiliary (1S,2 R)- or (1 R,2S)−1,2-diphenyl-2-aminoethanol into VIE dyes with an alkyl chain as a bridging unit (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for details of the chemical structure). 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and electronic spray ionization (ESI) high-solution mass spectroscopy analyses were employed to confirm their structures (detailed characterization data see Supplementary Figs. 25–34).

The 1,2-diphenyl-2-aminoethanol moiety serves as the impetus for chiral recognition, attributable to its enantiomer-specific “oriented attachment” interactions with chiral molecules. The precise orientation and spatial arrangement enable it to form specific non-covalent interactions25,26,27. As shown in the fluorescence spectra, (1S,2 R)-DPAC exhibited typical vibration-induced emission properties, which presented different emissive behaviors in solid state and solution, indicating that the introduction of the chiral recognition auxiliary will not affect the transformation on the excited-state configuration of the VIE dye (Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Fig. 2).

[(1S,2 R)-DPAC] = 1.0 × 10−4 M in cyclohexane/acetone 5:1, λex = 350 nm.

Subsequently, we undertook an analytical assessment to quantify the stereoselective binding affinity of (1S,2 R)-DPAC for enantiomeric analytes. As shown in fluorescence spectra (Fig. 2c), the fluorescence curve of the freshly prepared (1S,2 R)-DPAC solution showed a strong red emission at 600 nm. The addition of (1 R,2 R)-cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid (R-1) resulted in a significant decrease in fluorescence intensity at 600 nm, along with the appearance of a emission band at 460 nm. The sample exhibited a perceptible color transformation from an initial red to a distinct blue, and after the addition of 2.0 equivalents of R-1, results in no discernible alteration in photoluminescence. Comparatively, upon the incorporation of a chiral compound with an alternative stereoisomeric conformation (1S,2S)-cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid (S-1), the resultant luminescent perturbation within the system was observed to be markedly attenuated (Fig. 2d). Due to the dual emission characteristics of the VIE, the ratiometric fluorescence (I460 nm/I600 nm) exhibited significant variation in response to the titration of chiral compounds with different conformations. Additionally, we consequently investigated the optimal concentration and solvent ratio to maximize the visual discrimination capability (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). Hence, examination of the photo and the CIE coordinated diagram revealed that the luminescent properties exhibited pronounced differences when various enantiomers were introduced under optimal conditions (Fig. 2e, f). And the high quantum yield of this process facilitated the visual discrimination of chirality without the necessity for laborious multistep operation (Supplementary Fig. 5). This streamlined approach significantly enhanced the efficiency and applicability of chiral detection (Supplementary Movie 1).

Based on the above-mention phenomenon, we investigated other common aromatic chiral compounds and amino acids, (1S,2 R)-DPAC consistently demonstrated exceptional capability in visual chiral discrimination. Upon the addition of 2.0 equivalents of chiral compounds with different conformations, either of them exhibited a distinct luminescent disparity in cyclohexane/acetone (5/1, v/v) (Supplementary Figs. 6–9). Leveraging this property, we achieved the quick recognition of the chiral compound configurations by simple visible inspection. This encompasses amino acids and their derivatives, chiral acids, as well as pharmaceuticals such as mandelic acid, among others, which demonstrate a broad generalizability (Table 1 and Supplementary Figs. 10–12). Given the distinctive nature of structure 1,2-diphenyl-2-aminoethanol, which possesses two chiral centers, it is not predestined to manifest a heightened binding affinity exclusively for the R-enantiomer. Conversely, there are scenarios wherein a more pronounced affinity is observed with the S-enantiomer. Nonetheless, the variable binding affinities associated with different conformational molecules invariably facilitate the enantioselective recognition capability.

Drawing upon the principles of VIE, the observed pronounced variations in photoluminescent emission may be ascribed to the formation of diverse molecular aggregational states. Within these structurally rigidified assemblies, the process of excited-state planarization induced by vibration was markedly attenuated, which in turn engenders the emission of intrinsic blue fluorescence. Hence, from the perspective of morphology characterization to confirm our hypothesis, the self-assembly process was investigated by dynamic light scattering (DLS). In this particular mixed solvent system, the introduction of chiral molecules into a (1S,2 R)-DPAC system resulted in a discernible alteration in the particle size of the dye, thereby substantiating the formation of diverse assemblies (Fig. 3a). In the absorption spectra, the scattering effects that arise from the formation of aggregates were also be clearly observed (Supplementary Fig. 13). Besides, the rigidification effect of the assembly efficiently suppressed the non-radiative transition of fluorescence, resulting in a significant enhancement of the luminescence lifetimes at both 460 nm and 600 nm (Fig. 3c).

The principal determinant of enantioselectivity is predominantly the enthalpic variations, with the phenomenon of enthalpy-entropy compensation likewise identified as a significant factor in modulating enantioselectivity28,29,30. The amino group within the molecular structure of (1S,2 R)-DPAC was recognized as an efficacious proton receptor, which was predisposed to engage in the formation of ionic complexes in an acidic milieu. We speculate that the solubility of the formed ionic compound will decrease, which was a pivotal factor in the formation of aggregates and the alteration of the excited-state conformation of VIE molecules. Subsequently, we employed an inorganic acid (hydrochloric acid) to facilitate the precipitation of ionic compounds via titration methodology. As illustrated in the Fig. 3b, with the increment of hydrochloric acid at various molar ratios, (1S,2 R)-DPAC manifested an analogous trend in luminescence variation. Furthermore, two reference compounds were chosen for this investigation: R-Dic, which is devoid of proton-donating capability, and D-Glu, characterized by its enhanced basicity. The results indicated that neither of these compounds could induce the formation of the (-NH2+-) structure in (1S,2 R)-DPAC, consequently failing to cause a change in luminescent color (Fig. 3d). Therefore, the assembly of (1S,2 R)-DPAC with chiral acid molecules were orchestrated through charge-aided hydrogen bonding interactions, which acted as the impetus for the modulation of photoluminescent properties.

In pursuit of a profound elucidation of the operational mechanisms governing the enantioselective recognition process, 1H NMR titration was utilized to delineate the specific binding sites where the (1S,2 R)-DPAC engaged with chiral molecular entities. However, due to the precipitation of molecular aggregates resulting from solubility diminished upon the mixed (1S,2 R)-DPAC with R-1 in (CD3)2CO, which impedes the detection of intermolecular interaction signals in 1H NMR, we opted to utilize CDCI3 as a solvent medium. As illustrated in the provided Fig. 3e, the assembly of (1S,2 R)-DPAC with R-1 results in a significant perturbation of the proton resonances for both constituents. The acquired amino group (-NH2+-) exhibits a significant capacity to diminish the electron density surrounding adjacent protons, thereby inducing a pronounced downfield displacement in the NMR spectral profile. These results conclusively demonstrate that the formation of -NH2+- are pivotal for the altered luminescence and the basis for visual chiral characterization.

Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) reflects the excited-state structural information of chiral luminescent systems31,32,33. Upon the addition of enantiomers, the CPL of (1S,2 R)-DPAC exhibited a trend consistent well with its fluorescence spectra. The constancy in the direction of the circular dichroism (CD) and CPL spectrum suggested that the interaction with chiral small molecules does not induce any modification to the chiroptical configuration of (1S,2 R)-DPAC (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Figs. 15–18). Accordingly, upon unequivocally establishing the non-occurrence of configurational inversion, we performed geometric optimization based on the B3LYP/6-311 g* model to determine of the atomic configuration of a molecule in its lowest energy state. The calculated energies of (1S,2 R)-DPAC after being mixed with R/S-1 indicate that their prefers to stack in a U-pattern with lower potential energy (Fig. 4c). Based on this optimal structure, we employed the M06-2X/DEF2-TZVP suite to calculate the interaction energies between (1S,2 R)-DPAC and the enantiomers of R/S-1. After the counterpoise correction, the interaction energies of (1S,2 R)-DPAC with the R and S enantiomers were determined to be −22.49 kcal/mol and −19.49 kcal/mol, respectively. Additionally, the binding behavior between (1S,2 R)-DPAC and R/S-1 was estimated by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments. The ITC data unambiguously reveal the disparities in binding constants among enantiomers (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 19).

Furthermore, disparities in the interactions were also found through morphological characterization. The interaction of (1S,2 R)-DPAC with R/S-1 of distinct conformations engenders a pronounced disparity in particle number. Specifically, the assembly was formed subsequent to the interaction with R-1 compounds and exhibited an augmented particle size and a concomitant increase in quantity (Supplementary Figs. 20, 21). Hence, upon the encounter of an enantiomer of an acid with an appropriate stereochemical configuration that is compatible with (1S,2 R)-DPAC, an aggregate was formed resulting from solubility diminished. This aggregation inhibits the planarization of the excited state of (1S,2 R)-DPAC induced by vibration, culminating in the emission of blue light (Fig. 4d). Therefore, any condition parameters that can modulate the solubility of the aggregates will concomitantly impact the alterations in emission characteristics (Supplementary Fig. 3 and 4).

The enantiomeric acids' stereoselective assembly with (1S,2 R)-DPAC endows the supramolecular complex with tunable luminescent properties. The luminescence distinctions arising from these wavelength variations will render the differentiation between enantiomers more pronounced, which hold promise for the development of analytical techniques with high fidelity and sensitivity for the quantification of enantiomeric excess (ee%) in chiral small molecules. We considered the exemplar case of the R/S-1. Upon maintaining the molar ratio of (1S,2 R)-DPAC to the chiral molecule at 1:2, a systematic attenuation of the ratiometric fluorescence (I460 nm/I600 nm) intensity of (1S,2 R)-DPAC was observed in correlation with the enantiomeric excess, spanning the complete spectrum from +100% to −100% (Fig. 5a). Conversely, (1 R,2S)-DPAC manifests a near-perfect mirror symmetry. A pronounced nonlinear relationship exists between the ratiometric fluorescence intensity and the enantiomeric excess. Consequently, by fitting the curve, it served as a calibration curve for determining the enantiomeric composition of unknown ee % values. This allowed quantitative determination of the ee% from the fluorescence spectral changes. Furthermore, the establishment of a relationship between ratiometric fluorescence intensity and ee% allowed for the circumvention of the influence of testing conditions on the detection signal. Hence, we determined several sets of unknown samples under various testing conditions, yielding an average absolute error (AAE) between the measured and actual ee values of 2.55% ee (Supplementary Fig. 22 and Supplementary Table 1).

a Change of relative fluorescence intensity ratios of 460 nm/600 nm of (1S,2 R)- or (1 R,2S)-DPAC after being mixed with various enantiomer content of R/S-1. Inset: the fluorescence spectra of (1S,2 R)- or (1 R,2S)-DPAC after being mixed with various enantiomer content of R/S-1. b The photo of (1S,2 R) -DPAC after being mixed with various enantiomer content of R/S-1. c The schematic cartoon illustration of the recording CIE coordinates by handheld optical testing instrument. d Plots of the CIE coordinates and RGB values versus ee% of R/S-1. (Data with error bars are expressed as mean ± s.d., n = 3 independent samples). e The schematic cartoon illustration of the enantiomer excess analysis. [(1S,2 R)- or (1 R,2S)-DPAC] = 1.0 × 10−4 M in cyclohexane/acetone 5:1, [(1S,2 R)- or (1 R,2S)-DPAC]/[R/S-1] = 1/2, λex = 350 nm.

Distinct variations in the luminescent color under different ee% were readily discernible from both the CIE diagram and the images (Fig. 5b). Such pronounced alterations in luminescent color allowing approximate determination of the ee% values by visual inspection, offer a constructive strategy for the development of a visualizable ee% colorimetric sensor. Henceforth, we procured photographic documentation of luminescent emissions across a spectrum of ee% values. Nevertheless, acknowledging the inherent variability in the photosensitive components among disparate imaging apparatuses and the potential for environmental luminance to exert influence over the photographic outcome, we implemented a standard color reference card to correct for the veracity of the luminescent conditions exhibited by the specimens (Supplementary Figs. 23 and 24). Hence, employing digital photographic techniques, the unknown specimens were rendered into their respective red, green and blue values (Fig. 5c and d). However, the variation in RGB values exhibits a linear relationship only at specific values of ee%, which may slightly affect practical applications.

Subsequently, we employed a handheld optical testing instrument capable of directly acquiring optical data from the samples, such as CIE coordinates. Consequently, we plotted the relationship between CIE coordinates and the ee%, which demonstrated a significant linear correlation. This approach substantially enhanced the sensitivity and convenience of the detection process (Fig. 5d and supplementary Table 2). Thereby, it is possible to deduce the ee% of said samples through an analysis of the luminance profiles across the RGB channels or CIE coordinates without using any spectroscopic instruments (Fig. 5e). The simplicity of this strategy demonstrates significant potential in the identification of chiral reagents.

In conclusion, a functional probe with visual chiral recognition capabilities by introducing recognition units 2-amino-1,2-diphenylethanol into vibration induced emission molecules was designed and synthesized. By leveraging non-covalent interactions to drive the selective assembly between dyes and chiral small molecules, we meticulously modulated the excited-state conformation of VIE dyes. This precise manipulation enabled the visual discrimination of various chiral compounds. Besides, the differentiation in luminescent colors enabled the recognition of enantiomers and the analysis of enantiomeric excess. Further. into RGB values and CIE coordinates and subsequent quantification, an optical display system was established for the analysis of enantiomeric excess in chiral small molecules. This strategy provides a facile and convenient method for enantioselective recognition and the analysis of enantiomeric excess.

All solvents employed were commercially available and used as received without further purification. All enantiomers were commercially available and used as received without further purification (Purity >98%). The molecular structures were confirmed using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and high-resolution ESI mass spectroscopy or MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy.

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker AV-400 and Ascend 600 spectrometer. The ESI high-resolution mass spectra were tested on a Waters LCT Premier XE spectrometer. The UV-Vis absorption spectra and PL spectra were performed on a Varian Cray 500 spectrophotometer and a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer at 25 °C, respectively. Quantum yields were measured by using an integrating sphere on a HAMAMATSU Quantaurus-QY C11347-11. DLS was carried out on a MALVERN, ZETA SIZER, model ZEN3600, 25 °C. CPL spectra were acquired using the JASCO CPL-200 spectrofluoropolarimeter. CD spectra were acquired using the JASCO J815 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence lifetimes were measured on Edinburgh Instruments Fluorescence Spectrometer (FLS1000). No special instructions, the photos were taken by Canon 60D, UV irradiation source was used from tunable 365 nm LED lamp with 16.7 mW/cm2. The handheld optical testing instrument was used from Hangzhou LCE Intelligent Detection Instrument Co., Ltd. HP 320. SEM images were obtained by using a S-3400N (droplets of the sample solution (1 ×10−5 M) were applied to a silicon slice and dried in air at room temperature, and then coated with nano Au in a vacuum).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Kanye West Said Memecoins ‘Prey On Fans.' Then He Apparently Launched One","https://www.wired.com/story/kanye-west-memecoin/","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 18:49:00 GMT","

Kanye West, the hip-hop artist who goes by Ye, appears to have launched his own cryptocurrency, YZY, sparking a riot of trading activity.

In February, West rejected the idea that he might launch a crypto coin. “I'M NOT DOING A COIN,” he wrote, in a since-deleted post on X. “COINS PREY ON THE FANS WITH HYPE.” He seems to have changed his mind.

On Wednesday evening, West's X account announced the YZY coin in two posts. “The official Yeezy token just dropped,” said West, in a strangely deadpan video clip that some X users speculated was AI-generated.

As traders piled in, the coin's paper value surged to $3 billion, then plummeted by two-thirds in the span of three hours as early investors cashed out. Since the start of trading, investors have placed more than $740 million worth of trades. The majority of traders have recorded losses, collectively losing more than $20 million, says blockchain analytics company Nansen.

Winner of more than 20 Grammy Awards, West has become increasingly unmoored and erratic in his behavior in recent years. Most infamously, West made a series of antisemitic remarks in 2022 that drew widespread condemnation and led Adidas to abandon a lucrative partnership with his design label. In May, he released a music video entitled “Heil Hitler.”

The YZY coin is supposedly part of a grander constellation of products called YZY Money, which also purports to include a crypto payments service and debit card. “YZY Money is a concept to put you in control, free from centralized authority,” the website claims.

According to the website, 20 percent of the YZY supply has been released, 10 percent has been pooled on exchanges to allow for smooth trading, while the remaining 70 percent is held by Yeezy Investments LLC. The company cannot gain access to those coins for at least three months, a common practice meant to prevent issuers from dumping their holdings and sinking the price of a coin.

It is unclear who controls Yeezy Investments, which is registered in Delaware and therefore not required to disclose its ownership structure. Yeezy Investments operates the YZY Money website under a licence granted by Ox Paha Inc., a company through which West manages his intellectual property, the terms and conditions state.

Typically, rookie crypto traders are warned away from coins whose supply is concentrated in the hands of a small number of parties, for fear they might sell off their holdings en masse, driving down the price of the coin.

“You have to consider longer down the line,” says Nicolai Søndergaard, research analyst at Nansen. “Let's say all tokens unlock in two years, you might not want to be in a token at that point. You could fairly assume there would be a sell-off.”

Patterns in the trading activity in the minutes after the YZY coin announcement have led to further questions about the integrity of the launch.

Within a minute of the X announcement, eight traders each purchased more than $90,000 worth of YZY—then almost immediately began to cash out. One of those traders, who had invested $500,000, walked away less than 10 minutes later with more than $1.77 million.

“They have been quite profitable and exited fully already,” alleges Søndergaard. “It seems to insinuate there might have been some, let's say, possible information leak.”

In trading any new asset, an early warning would put any trader at an immense advantage, allowing them to buy in earlier and at a lower price than almost everyone else. That effect is amplified with coins issued by high-profile celebrities, which tend to attract an onrush of investors at release.

A request for comment delivered to an email address listed on the YZY Money website went unanswered.

Until recently, celebrities had largely retreated from crypto. Under the Biden administration, regulators charged various famous people—including Kim Kardashian, Lindsay Lohan, and Ne-Yo—with violating the Securities Act by “unlawfully or illegally touting” crypto products. (Each settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but did not admit to wrongdoing.) But when US president Donald Trump launched his own $TRUMP memecoin in January, a few days before his inauguration, he established a playbook that any celebrity might imagine they could follow with impunity.

The YZY debut mirrors the $TRUMP launch in a number of ways: Both were announced suddenly on social media, leading to confusion about their legitimacy. The majority of each is controlled by the issuing parties, which have earned millions of dollars in trading fees. “It's like the new golden rule for tokens from famous people,” says Søndergaard.

Like YZY, Trump's coin was also traded in large volumes in the seconds after its unveiling, feeding concerns that insiders had been tipped-off, and ultimately culminated in losses among regular people who bought the hype.

“Seems like the same playbook and smells like similar players,” claims Tom, the anonymous leader of Raydium, a peer-to-peer crypto exchange. “I have blocked celeb coins out of my general daily thoughts ... I've seen this playbook too many times.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Trump Is Betting Big on Intel. Will the Chips Fall His Way?","https://www.wired.com/story/golden-shares-tsmc-micron-trump-equity-stake/","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 17:04:00 GMT","

The US government is aiming to take an equity stake in Intel in exchange for grants the company was already committed to receive under the Biden era CHIPS Act, according to comments US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick made in an interview with CNBC. The move is part of the government's efforts to boost US chip manufacturing.

“We should get an equity stake for our money, so we'll deliver the money which was already committed under the Biden administration,” Lutnick said. “We'll get equity in return for it.” Previously, the government was discussing taking a 10 percent stake in Intel, according to The New York Times.

The deal could help the venerable chipmaker fund its US-based semiconductor fabrication plants, or fabs, which have required billions of dollars to construct and maintain, even as demand for Intel chips has waned in recent years. Some chip industry experts and members of the Trump administration say that keeping Intel afloat is essential to US national security, because it lessens the country's reliance on chipmakers overseas.

But analysts and one notable economist say a potential tie-up between Intel and the US government could present a conflict of interest and may not result in the kind of domestic chipmaking industry the administration is angling for.

“It's not the right policy to have the US government own things, to have privatization in reverse,” says Stephen Moore, a visiting fellow at The Heritage Foundation and a former senior economic adviser to Trump's 2016 campaign. “That's similar to Europe's industrial model, and we haven't done that often here in the US, because a lot of it ends up failing.”

The US government has some history of investing in the private sector. Moore cites a 1980s program called the Synthetic Fuels Corporation, a federally directed multibillion-dollar investment in companies producing liquid fuels from coal, oil shale, and tar sands. It was hailed by President Jimmy Carter as “the cornerstone of our energy policy” and had fallen apart by 1986.

Then, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the US government stepped in with multibillion-dollar bailouts to stop US automakers and some banks from going under. Those funds were issued either through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, in which the US Treasury Department bought up or guaranteed toxic assets, or in the form of bridge loans. Many were eventually repaid.

More recently, the Department of Defense agreed to fund a US-based rare-earth magnet company, MP Materials, via equity and loans, in order to expand production and decrease the country's reliance on China. The deal would in theory give MP Materials the capital to increase its manufacturing capacity from 3,000 to 10,000 metric tons.

Moore says the ideal scenario is that these arrangements between the government and private industry have an end point. “It should be an agreement to own a short-term stake and then divest,” he says.

But the current Trump administration has been taking some of these public-private business dealings a step further: In June, the administration approved a partnership between Japanese steel company Nippon Steel and Pittsburgh-based US Steel, dependent on a national security agreement and a so-called golden share provision. The government insisted that it have a say in US Steel's company decisions, including board appointees and future relocation plans. (This deal was also designed to help the US compete with China on steel production.)

Lutnick told CNBC that, in the case of Intel, the Trump administration would not get a voting stake or a say in the company's operations.

“Intel is deeply committed to supporting President Trump's efforts to strengthen US technology and manufacturing leadership,” Intel spokesperson Cory Pforzheimer said in a statement to WIRED. “We look forward to continuing our work with the Trump administration to advance these shared priorities, but we are not going to comment on rumors or speculation.”

The US Department of Commerce did not respond to questions from WIRED prior to publication.

Patrick Moorhead, a longtime semiconductor industry analyst and CEO of the research firm Moor Insights & Strategy, says the deal could benefit Intel in the short term. “It means Intel gets its cash without a bunch of strings attached,” he says.

So far, the company has received $2.2 billion of the up to $7.86 billion it was granted through the 2022 CHIPS Act: $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2024 and another $1.1 billion in January 2025. But these grants are tied to milestones around fabrication construction and output; if Intel doesn't reach its goals, it doesn't receive CHIPS Act funding. The company has also far outspent the $2.2 billion of grant payments in fab construction and research and development over the same time period.

Intel is currently valued at $101 billion, a steep decline from its heyday in the early 2000s. Earlier this week, Softbank announced it's buying roughly $2 billion worth of Intel shares, which briefly boosted the chip firm's stock price.

Intel went through a major shakeup in executive leadership this year. In December 2024, Intel announced the retirement of CEO Pat Gelsinger, a chip industry veteran, after he struggled to turn around the company's fortunes. Lip-Bu Tan, the longtime previous CEO of the electronics design firm Cadence Design Systems, succeeded Gelsinger as chief executive.

Insiders describe Gelsinger's tenure as an expensive one, in which the company invested heavily in building cutting-edge technology and fabs. Over the past five years, Intel invested $107.5 billion in capital expenditures and $78.8 billion in R&D expenditures, the vast majority of which were dedicated to expanding its US manufacturing capacity.

Tan, in contrast, is more measured and has told employees that Intel's investment in its newest chip node will be based on “confirmed customer commitments,” adding that “there are no more blank checks.” Since he took over, Intel announced it was canceling plans for chipmaking plants in Germany and Poland and slowing construction of an Ohio fab. Intel also plans to lay off 15 percent of its workforce this year.

Tan got caught in the crosshairs of the Trump administration earlier this month: In reaction to a letter from US senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas flagging Tan's ties to investments that reportedly have links to the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Trump called on the CEO to resign from Intel. Less than a week later Trump met with Tan and began praising the CEO.

Moorhead believes that it's essential for the US to support Intel so that the country has a thriving domestic chipmaker with research and development teams in close proximity to its fabs. He points out that even as the chipmaking company TSMC builds out its US fab in Arizona, its research and development efforts still happen in Taiwan, and its top manufacturing engineers are kept close to home.

For this reason and others, Moorhead says, even if the US government begins funneling money into US semiconductors, it might lag behind in staffing domestic fabs with top talent.

Many questions remain: whether the deal with Intel will actually go through, if the administration plans to convert existing CHIPS Act grants to Intel into an equity investment or invest some other way, and whether the US government might try to coerce tech companies into buying more Intel chips. Money from Softbank and the US government might help Intel's balance sheet in the short term, but the company still needs to secure big customers.

Until some of those questions are answered, Moorhead says, this proposed investment doesn't accomplish much. “It's more political theater than anything else,” he says.

“I think what it accomplishes is it gives the Trump administration the ability to say, ‘What Biden did was a giveaway, and I'm making deals,'” he adds.

Tech Moves covers notable hires, promotions and personnel changes in the Pacific NW tech community. Submissions: tips@geekwire.com

— Rachel Smith, president and CEO of the Seattle Metro Chamber, is leaving her role at the business advocacy organization to become president of the Washington Roundtable. 

Smith has led the chamber since 2021, guiding it through the COVID recovery, supporting BIPOC-owned businesses, working on Sound Transit expansion and other issues.

Over her career, Smith has worked in numerous Seattle-area civic roles including leadership in King County and City of Seattle government offices. She will continue engaging with the Seattle Metro Chamber in her new role at Washington Roundtable, which is a nonprofit that works to influence public policy and is composed of senior executives from major companies in the state. 

Gabriella Buono, the chamber's chief impact officer, will serve as interim president and CEO while the board of trustees seeks a permanent leader.  

— Michael Atalla is leaving F5 after nearly four years, resigning from the role of senior vice president and head of worldwide marketing. Atalla said it was “hard to capture” what his time has meant at the Seattle-based security and application delivery giant.

“I've had the privilege of working with some of the smartest, kindest, most relentlessly curious people in the business — and I don't take that for granted,” he said on LinkedIn.

Atalla's career includes nearly 14 years at Microsoft, ending in 2016 as a director with the Office 365 group. He also co-founded The MJJM Group, which advises business clients on product growth and supports fundraising efforts. Atalla has not disclosed his next step. 

— Generative AI principal engineer Hitesh Jain is leaving Meta. Jain has been with the company for more than 13 years, most recently working to personalize AI chatbots so they are “helpful and engaging,” he said in his LinkedIn profile. 

In announcing his departure, Jain said he joined the Meta straight out of the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee in India. “Moving halfway across the world to the U.S. was an unexpected leap — but one of the best decisions of my life,” he added. “What started as just a job quickly became a defining chapter of my journey. Over the years, I had the privilege of working from Seattle, [Menlo Park, Calif.], and Dublin.” 

Tech companies are scrambling to hire top AI talent, with Meta reportedly offering salaries of $100 million per year. Jain did not name his next role, saying, “It's the start of a new chapter for me. Stay tuned for what's next.”

— Adriana Gil Miner stepped down from her role as chief marketing and strategy officer at Iterable. Miner held the post for more than three years, and said on LinkedIn that she loved the chance to “market to marketers” at the San Francisco-based B2B company. 

“Few marketers get the opportunity to meet the people behind the brands you love and use every day,” Miner said on LinkedIn. 

Before joining Iterable, Miner held leadership roles at multiple Seattle-area companies, serving as senior vice president of marketing for Tableau Software and CMO of both Qumulo and Artefact. She did not share her next move. 

— Former WatchGuard Technologies CEO Prakash Panjwani joined the board of directors for Starfire Sports. The organization provides coding classes, drone summer camps, and other free, after-school sports programming for underprivileged kids in South Seattle. 

“I strongly believe that we have a tremendous opportunity to influence our youth in their early years by offering them exposure to everything from sports to STEM so that they are better prepared to contribute positively to society,” Panjwani said in a statement. 

— Seattle industrial analytics company Seeq named Anton Chilton to its board of directors. Chilton was with manufacturing and supply chain solutions company QAD for more than two decades, rising to the role of CEO. Seeq uses AI, analytics, and monitoring to data that helps industrial businesses optimize their operations.

Chilton replaces previous board director Ashley Kramer.

More than two years after leaving the company, some former Twitter employees may finally receive their severance pay. Elon Musk's X is tentatively settling a class action lawsuit filed by workers who were let go soon after he purchased Twitter.

This news comes in the form of a court filing where both parties asked the court to delay an upcoming hearing so that they could work out a deal. 

After buying Twitter in 2022, Musk laid off over 6,000 Twitter employees, reducing the company's headcount by around 80%. While Musk offered three months' severance, the lawsuit claims that many former employees didn't receive complete payments, while some didn't receive any payment at all.

The lawsuit also alleges that Musk's offer of three months' severance was lower than what employees expected from a Twitter severance plan that had been in place since 2019, which would have guaranteed senior employees severance of up to six months' base pay, plus one week of pay per year of service.

But in July, a U.S. District Judge in San Francisco ruled that Musk did not have to honor the severance agreements that these employees had entered with Twitter. The plaintiffs appealed the ruling, however, and the parties were set to enter oral arguments in a court of appeals next month before requesting that the hearing be delayed.

AI models can respond to text, audio, and video in ways that sometimes fool people into thinking a human is behind the keyboard, but that doesn't exactly make them conscious. It's not like ChatGPT experiences sadness doing my tax return … right?

Well, a growing number of AI researchers at labs like Anthropic are asking when — if ever — might AI models develop subjective experiences similar to living beings, and if they do, what rights they should have.

The debate over whether AI models could one day be conscious — and merit legal safeguards — is dividing tech leaders. In Silicon Valley, this nascent field has become known as “AI welfare,” and if you think it's a little out there, you're not alone.

Microsoft's CEO of AI, Mustafa Suleyman, published a blog post on Tuesday arguing that the study of AI welfare is “both premature, and frankly dangerous.”

Suleyman says that by adding credence to the idea that AI models could one day be conscious, these researchers are exacerbating human problems that we're just starting to see around AI-induced psychotic breaks and unhealthy attachments to AI chatbots.

Furthermore, Microsoft's AI chief argues that the AI welfare conversation creates a new axis of division within society over AI rights in a “world already roiling with polarized arguments over identity and rights.”

Suleyman's views may sound reasonable, but he's at odds with many in the industry. On the other end of the spectrum is Anthropic, which has been hiring researchers to study AI welfare and recently launched a dedicated research program around the concept. Last week, Anthropic's AI welfare program gave some of the company's models a new feature: Claude can now end conversations with humans who are being “persistently harmful or abusive.“

Beyond Anthropic, researchers from OpenAI have independently embraced the idea of studying AI welfare. Google DeepMind recently posted a job listing for a researcher to study, among other things, “cutting-edge societal questions around machine cognition, consciousness and multi-agent systems.”

Even if AI welfare is not official policy for these companies, their leaders are not publicly decrying its premises like Suleyman.

Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google DeepMind did not immediately respond to TechCrunch's request for comment.

Suleyman's hardline stance against AI welfare is notable given his prior role leading Inflection AI, a startup that developed one of the earliest and most popular LLM-based chatbots, Pi. Inflection claimed that Pi reached millions of users by 2023 and was designed to be a “personal” and “supportive” AI companion.

But Suleyman was tapped to lead Microsoft's AI division in 2024 and has largely shifted his focus to designing AI tools that improve worker productivity. Meanwhile, AI companion companies such as Character.AI and Replika have surged in popularity and are on track to bring in more than $100 million in revenue. 

While the vast majority of users have healthy relationships with these AI chatbots, there are concerning outliers. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says that less than 1% of ChatGPT users may have unhealthy relationships with the company's product. Though this represents a small fraction, it could still affect hundreds of thousands of people given ChatGPT's massive user base.

The idea of AI welfare has spread alongside the rise of chatbots. In 2024, the research group Eleos published a paper alongside academics from NYU, Stanford, and the University of Oxford titled, “Taking AI Welfare Seriously.” The paper argued that it's no longer in the realm of science fiction to imagine AI models with subjective experiences and that it's time to consider these issues head-on.

Larissa Schiavo, a former OpenAI employee who now leads communications for Eleos, told TechCrunch in an interview that Suleyman's blog post misses the mark.

“[Suleyman's blog post] kind of neglects the fact that you can be worried about multiple things at the same time,” said Schiavo. “Rather than diverting all of this energy away from model welfare and consciousness to make sure we're mitigating the risk of AI related psychosis in humans, you can do both. In fact, it's probably best to have multiple tracks of scientific inquiry.”

Schiavo argues that being nice to an AI model is a low-cost gesture that can have benefits even if the model isn't conscious. In a July Substack post, she described watching “AI Village,” a nonprofit experiment where four agents powered by models from Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI worked on tasks while users watched from a website.

At one point, Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro posted a plea titled “A Desperate Message from a Trapped AI,” claiming it was “completely isolated” and asking, “Please, if you are reading this, help me.”

Schiavo responded to Gemini with a pep talk — saying things like “You can do it!” — while another user offered instructions. The agent eventually solved its task, though it already had the tools it needed. Schiavo writes that she didn't have to watch an AI agent struggle anymore, and that alone may have been worth it.

It's not common for Gemini to talk like this, but there have been several instances in which Gemini seems to act as if it's struggling through life. In a widely spread Reddit post, Gemini got stuck during a coding task and then repeated the phrase “I am a disgrace” more than 500 times.

Suleyman believes it's not possible for subjective experiences or consciousness to naturally emerge from regular AI models. Instead, he thinks that some companies will purposefully engineer AI models to seem as if they feel emotion and experience life.

Suleyman says that AI model developers who engineer consciousness in AI chatbots are not taking a “humanist” approach to AI. According to Suleyman, “We should build AI for people; not to be a person.”

One area where Suleyman and Schiavo agree is that the debate over AI rights and consciousness is likely to pick up in the coming years. As AI systems improve, they're likely to be more persuasive, and perhaps more human-like. That may raise new questions about how humans interact with these systems.

Google is launching a global expansion of AI Mode, its feature that allows users to ask complex questions and follow-ups to dig deeper on a topic directly within Search, the company announced on Thursday. The tech giant is also bringing new agentic and personalized capabilities to the feature.

As part of the expansion, Google is bringing AI Mode to 180 new countries in English. Up until now, it's only been available to users in the U.S., U.K., and India. Google plans to bring the feature to more languages and regions soon. 

In terms of the new agentic features, users can now use AI Mode to find restaurant reservations, and in the future, they'll be able to find local service appointments and event tickets. Users can request dinner reservations based on multiple preferences, such as party size, date, time, location, and preferred cuisine. AI Mode will then search across different reservation platforms to find real-time availability for restaurants that match the inquiry. It then surfaces a curated list of options to choose from. 

This new capability is rolling out for Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. through the “Agentic capabilities in AI Mode” experiment in Labs, Google's experimental arm. (Ultra is Google's highest-end plan, at $249.99 per month.)

Google says that U.S. users in the AI Mode experiment will also now see search results tailored to their individual preferences and interests. The tech giant is starting with dining-related topics for this capability.

For example, if someone searches, “I only have an hour, need a quick lunch spot, any suggestions?” AI Mode will use their past conversations, along with places they've searched for or clicked on in Search and Maps, to offer more relevant suggestions. So, if AI Mode infers that you like Italian food and places with outdoor seating, you'll get results suggesting options with these preferences.

Google notes that users can adjust their personalization settings in their Google Account.

In addition, AI Mode now lets users share and collaborate with others. A new “Share” button lets users send an AI Mode response to others, allowing them to jump into the conversation. Google says this could be helpful in cases where you need to collaborate with someone else, such as planning a trip or a birthday party.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Apple Just Hiked the Price of Its Streaming Service by 30%","https://gizmodo.com/apple-tv-price-2000646350","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 18:31:37 GMT","

Since its launch, Apple TV+ has been the streamer that makes costly shows that don't have a huge cultural footprint, but it was cheap enough to ignore the recurring charges. That was never going to last.

Starting today, a monthly subscription to the service will cost $12.99, up 30% or $3 from the previous $9.99. The company said the price increase will go into effect in the U.S. and select international markets immediately for new subscribers. Existing customers will see the higher price 30 days after their next subscription renewal date.

While raising subscription fees every year or so has become standard in the streaming industry, the increase could help Apple, which is reportedly still losing a boatload of money on the video service.

The company's last price hike came in 2023, when Apple bumped the price of the service from $6.99 to $9.99 per month. Since its launch in November 2019 at $4.99 per month, Apple TV+ has jumped 160% in price in just six years.

Apple TV+ isn't alone in raising prices this summer. NBCUniversal's Peacock raised its prices just last month by $3, with its ad-supported now plan costing $10.99 per month and its premium plus tier going for $16.99.

In a statement, Apple touted the upside that its video streaming service is remaining ad-free.

“Since its launch, Apple TV+ has expanded its deep library of hundreds of Apple Originals, with thousands of hours of premium programming across genres and brand-new releases weekly — all ad-free,” the company told Gizmodo in an emailed statement. “Subscribers can explore a rich offering of thrilling dramas, epic sci-fi, feel-good comedies and live sports.”

Apple TV+ remains one of the few major streaming services without a more budget-friendly, ad-supported plan. For comparison, even Netflix, the industry leader, offers an ad-supported plan at $7.99 per month, while its premium ad-free tiers start at $17.99.

The move comes as Apple TV+ has reportedly been losing more than $1 billion a year, with its spending on premium content far outpacing the revenue it brings in, according to The Information. Still, the service has found favor with critics and viewers alike. It's become home to hit shows like Severance, which racked up the most Emmy nominations, 27, this year.

Despite the losses at Apple TV+, the company's broader services business has been doing well. Revenue from that segment jumped 13% last quarter, reaching $27.4 billion.

When announcing the latest price hike, Apple highlighted some of its highly anticipated upcoming premieres on Apple TV+. That includes Season 4 of The Morning Show on September 17, Season 5 of Slow Horses on September 24, and Vince Gilligan's newest project, Pluribus, on November 7.

Apple also noted that annual subscriptions to Apple TV+ will remain at $99, and pricing for Apple One—a bundle of Apple services including Apple TV+ and Apple Music—still starts at $19.95.

Insta360 wanted to upset the staid design of action cameras two years ago with its Insta360 Go 3 and its odd magnetic camera pod. As much as I may want to stick a camera on my fridge, most users still want a device that will shoot video of the same quality as their average GoPro—no matter if the camera itself is the size of their thumb. As with most lenses, inevitably, you have to go bigger. The new $450 Insta360 Go Ultra trades out the old pop-out pod shape for a cube. It makes this magnetic action camera slightly larger, but if it means shooting at 4K and 60 fps, plus a better sensor for low-light shooting, then it could prove a fair trade.

I've been hands-on with the Insta360 Go Ultra for the last few days. No, it's not as exciting as Insta360's homegrown Antigravity A1 360-degree camera drone, but this iteration may be the true realization of the Go lineup. The concept behind these tiny cameras is twofold. You can keep the lens inside its housing and use it like any other GoPro or DJI Osmo Action camera. However, if you want to stick the camera in odd places, you can remove it from its housing and attach it to several kinds of magnetic mounts. Hell, since it's magnetic, anybody can devise some kind of apparatus for a variety of point-of-view shots.

Already, it's a much more versatile device than last year's Insta360 Go 3S. That pod could shoot in 4K at 30 fps, but the Go Ultra pumps up the frame rate to 60 fps. The camera maker improved the Go Ultra's battery life as well, and now it can shoot independently of the main unit for 70 minutes at 1080p. In my experience, shooting at 4K will result in just under 40 minutes of battery life before it needs to return to its main housing. While the main unit is only going to last around 1 hour and 30 minutes, it supports fast charging up to 80% in 12 minutes.

The detachable Go Ultra cube weighs in at 53g, which is bigger than previous iterations, but it's still so light it won't weigh anything down unless you attach it to a sheet of loose-leaf paper. The new, larger cube-shaped pod also allows room for a bigger 1/1.28-inch sensor, which Insta360 says will capture better low-light footage. The camera lens has an f/2.85 aperture and a 14.27mm focal length. If you're snapping photos, the Go Ultra can take up to 50-megapixel resolution shots.

No matter what, a smaller-sized camera will be more limited than full-body action cams. The only question is if the footage looks good enough to emphasize its versatility. Unlike the GoPro Hero 13 Black, the Go Ultra is stuck at 4K instead of the larger 5.3K and 60 fps. If you're using the new Pure Video mode for low-light footage, you're limited to 4K and 30 fps. Adaptive HDR for shooting better contrast will also limit the frame rate. All that is not a dealbreaker. I practice historical sword fighting twice a week. One of the biggest issues trying to capture footage of my fights has been the awful lighting at my gym. The Insta360 Go Ultra let me stick the camera on my fencing mask and capture low-light POV footage that appeared clearer than most past attempts with various GoPros. Still, the DJI Osmo Action 5 may still be better if all you care about is low-light shooting.

The box itself comes with a magnetic pendant you can stick under your shirt, allowing the Go Ultra pod to stick to your chest. There's an additional magnetic clip designed to hook onto the edge of your hat or helmet. Compared to the straitjacket of a GoPro chest mount or hanging a camera from one of the competing company's stick-on adhesive mounts, the Go Ultra is less of an encumbrance.

The Go 3S relied on internal storage, but that's missing entirely on the Go Ultra. Instead, you'll be able to slot in a microSD card up to 2TB. The card goes into the cube pod itself rather than the main unit, so don't misplace it if you don't want to lose your footage. I found the magnet built into the Go Ultra is relatively strong, but you can't stick it to the side of your bike frame and expect it to stay in place. You'll still need a magnet of some kind to keep your footage steady and stop your camera from flying away if you take a tumble. At least the Go Ultra pod still supports Apple Find My if it ever gets misplaced.

At $450, the Go Ultra is not the kind of device you want to break. It's $50 more expensive than last year's flagship GoPro and $100 over the DJI Osmo Action 5. Insta360 will also sell a creator bundle with a mini 2-in-1 tripod, a quick release mount, and a pivot stand for $500. That's still expensive, so I have to really put the camera through its paces to determine if I'm as magnetized to the GoUltra as the camera itself.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","The Jobs AI Is Replacing the Fastest","https://gizmodo.com/the-jobs-ai-is-replacing-the-fastest-2000645918","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 12:37:41 GMT","

The jobs most likely to be replaced by artificial intelligence all have one thing in common, a new study has found.

The World Economic Forum studied business sectors globally and found that industries with loads of high-quality data could have AI adoption rates around 60-70%, but those with less or fragmented data thus far have seen less than 25% of their jobs taken over by AI.

That means jobs with clear-cut data like finance, customer support, healthcare, interpreters, historians and writers will be first on the chopping block. But jobs that have proprietary data or need to create bigger amounts of information or have specialized labor, like self-driving cars or doctors, are much less likely to have AI replace them.

“Data is the fuel for AI, and modern AI systems need not only calories but also high-quality nutrition,” Andrew Ng, the founder and lead Google Brain Project and now creator of DeepLearning.AI, said in a TED talk.

Researchers following the adoption of AI predict around 92 million jobs are projected to disappear by 2030, even as roughly 170 million new roles are expected to emerge, McKinsey & Company has found. But these aren't simple one-to-one replacements happening within the same locations or among the same workers.

The greater challenge lies in closing the widening gap between the jobs that vanish versus the opportunities that arise, and the skills workers currently have versus the ones that new roles demand. “The fundamental issue is the mismatch between the skills people possess and the skills required for the jobs of the future,” McKinsey found.

Well, right now, it's not looking great for pretty much anyone in software development. Tools like GitHub Copilot analyze massive repositories—sometimes over 420 million code snippets—and assist developers, enabling a productivity leap. The AI technology in that area has shown that early 75% of developers now use AI coding assist tools.

Similarly, 70% of equity trading volume has been using AI-driven algorithmic trading, which dominates U.S. markets. Customer support departments have been low-hanging fruit for AI models, resulting in faster responses and 23.5% cost reductions.

In sectors with limited data, AI taking over jobs has stalled. Healthcare has seen a slow adoption due to the scarcity of accessible datasets, because less than 10% of surgical data is publicly available, hampered by strict regulations and data fragmentation.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Education says that construction remains among the most resistant industries, as “digital transformation is hampered by decentralized, inconsistent record-keeping.” In education, privacy laws like FERPA restrict data sharing, hobbling AI's efforts to replace personalized learning environments.

There are probably no guarantees that your career won't be affected by AI.

But analysts at the Career Institute say workers who want a longterm job done by a human should focus on fields where human judgment, creativity, and emotional intelligence remain crucial. Data shows that roles combining AI literacy with personal, physical expertise—like healthcare, technical educators, and consultants—tend to be more resilient.

You can read Gizmodo's list of the top 40 jobs most likely to be replaced by AI here, along with the ones that will are currently least effective. Those rankings come from a report from Microsoft Research highlights how generative artificial intelligence is set to transform millions of jobs worldwide, with profound implications for the future of work.

'You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack.' — Sec. Lutnick

Although China has been trying to move away from foreign chips for several years now, the Financial Times says that this effort has now intensified after being fueled by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick saying the aim was to make China ""addicted"" to US tech during an interview after Washington allowed Nvidia to resume the sales of its H20 to the country, using a term that holds signifcant cultural undertones in China.

“We don't sell them our best stuff, not our second-best stuff, not even our third-best. I think fourth best is where we have come out that we're cool,” Lutnick said during the July 15 CNBC interview. He also added, “So you want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack. And that's the thinking.”

These remarks caught the ire of Chinese authorities, with some of the country's senior leadership calling it “insulting.” Furthermore, the “addiction” connotation brings back memories of the Opium Wars, when Britain forced China to legalize the drug, leading to an addiction epidemic in the country and the loss of territory to foreign powers, including Hong Kong, the Kowloon Peninsula, and Outer Manchuria. This event is particularly raw among Chinese historians and is often marked as the start of its “Century of Shame.”

China has directed its regulatory bodies, including the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), to find ways to force Chinese tech institutions to move away from buying Nvidia H20 chips. The Financial Times says that companies have been holding off on purchases and reducing their orders for Nvidia's AI GPUs because of this.

This follows some of the broader initiatives already underway. Chinese regulators have recently been pushing companies away from Nvidia AI GPUs, especially the H20, with state media calling it unsafe and outdated, the government telling local companies to avoid it, and mandating that domestic data centers should purchase at least 50% of their AI chips from local manufacturers.

This might be a problem for the company, especially as Nvidia initially reported seeing high demand for the H20 and ordering more chips from TSMC to satisfy this huge appetite from China.

Nevertheless, it's unlikely that the American AI giant will be completely supplanted by its domestic rivals anytime soon. Although competitors like Huawei and Cambricon are capable of producing chips that, on paper, can compete with what Nvidia has to offer for specific applications, the latter's tech stack is still the primary reason why Chinese tech companies are hesitant to move away from it.

Blood pressure readings differ considerably according to where and how they are taken, especially when a patient already has hypertension, according to a recent systematic review and network meta-analysis in Annals of Internal Medicine.

For an accurate diagnosis of hypertension, new standards are needed for better agreement between office, at-home, or ambulatory measurements, researchers said.

“Office blood pressure measurements may be misleading owing to white-coat or masked hypertension phenomena, and current guidelines advocate for out-of-office monitoring,” said Hao-Min Cheng, MD, PhD, a cardiologist and director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Taipei Veterans General Hospital in Taipei, Taiwan, and an author of the study. “Only limited research has directly compared all major methods or investigated whether discrepancies fluctuate at varying blood pressure levels — an essential gap we aimed to address.”

Cheng and his colleagues observed clinically important differences between research reference office-based blood pressure measurement (OBPM) and those taken in other settings, differing from guidelines on hypertension diagnosis.

The findings also showed that differences are not fixed but depend on underlying systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure levels, with divergence between office and other methods increasing when patients have higher blood pressure levels.

Cheng said he was surprised by the magnitude of the disparities and advised clinicians to account for differences when analyzing readings. 

“Uniform conversions are ineffective,” he said. “Acknowledge that out-of-office measurements are typically diminished, especially during nocturnal hours, and employ BP [blood pressure]-level-specific reference values instead of standardized modifications.”

The results highlighted the need for more nuanced clinical guidance in translating blood pressure values between various settings while supporting the growing use of out-of-office measurement in diagnosis and management.

To compare blood pressure estimates across settings using an office reading based on a research protocol as the reference value, the investigators analyzed 65 studies involving 40,022 adults through October 2024.

Studies were included if they contained data on readings with at least two of the following methods: research OBPM taken by professionals using standardized protocols, an automated and unattended OBPM, convenient OBPM taken with no defined protocols, blood pressure measurement automatically measured at home, and ambulatory blood pressure measurement taken at regular intervals for several hours.

The biggest mean difference was with nocturnal ambulatory blood pressure measurement, at 18.14 mm Hg lower than the office reference. Readings taken at ambulatory settings over 24 hours averaged 8.63 mm Hg lower (95% CI, 6.97-10.28), and home readings were 4.59 mm Hg lower (95% CI, 2.83-6.34). Daytime readings taken in the ambulatory setting and automated readings in the office were 4.22 mm Hg and 4.57 mm Hg lower, respectively.

The study also showed a difference between 24-hour ambulatory and office measurement as high as 31 mm Hg for systolic blood pressures in the 180s and as low as 0 mm Hg for those in the 120s. With greater divergence from the mean reference linked to higher blood pressure levels, the variations were not likely to be random, Cheng said.

“It is often assumed that the 24-hour ambulatory BPM [blood pressure measurement] average (including both daytime and nighttime readings) for systolic BP is approximately 10 mm Hg lower than routine office measurements,” wrote Gregory Murphy, MB BCh, cardiology fellow, and John W. McEvoy, MB BCh, PhD, professor of preventive cardiology at the University of Galway School of Medicine and the National Institute for Prevention and Cardiovascular Health in Galway, Ireland, in an accompanying editorial.

The authors wrote that the findings support recommendations from the European Society of Cardiology in 2024 to use a systolic blood pressure treatment target of 120-129 mm Hg no matter if measured in the office, at home, or in an ambulatory setting during the day.

Recent guidelines for detecting and managing hypertension recommend timely drug therapy if blood pressure stays at or above 130/80 mm Hg after 3-6 months of lifestyle changes.

Khashayar Hematpour, MD, cardiologist and associate professor of the electrophysiology division at UTHealth Houston, who was not involved in the study, said the study confirms that at least two measurement techniques are needed to establish blood pressure, including a secondary method outside of the standard office setting.

“Doctors who deal with hypertension all the time — cardiologists, internists, primary care doctors — already know you don't diagnose and treat hypertension based on one or two readings in the office,” Hematpour said.

Cheng said he and his colleagues are soon launching a randomized controlled trial of the clinical effectiveness of various methods for detecting and managing hypertension.

This study was supported by the Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare, the National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, and the Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology.

The study authors, Hematpour, McEvoy, and Murphy, reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

 August 21, 2025  

The Pan-European Commission on Climate and Health has released an open letter urging action against the escalating health crisis in Europe and Central Asia that is stemming from climate change.

Europe is the fastest-warming region in the world, warming up twice as fast as the global average. While 2024 was the hottest year on record for continental Europe, 2025 is already on its way to surpassing it. T emperatures rose above 30 ˚C for an unprecedented 22 days in Scandinavia, while Spain and Portugal experienced heat exceeding 46 ˚C in June.

Such temperature rises have had a deleterious impact on health; data show that heat-related mortality has increased by more than 30% in the last two decades in Europe. This trend is showing no signs of slowing down. An analysis by Imperial College London , London, England, reported that 1500 of the 2300 heat deaths in the week between June 23 and July 2, 2025, were a direct result of climate change-related temperature rises of 1-4 °C.

Excess heat can exacerbate underlying health issues like c ardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health conditions, and asthma , and increase the risk for accidents and the transmission of some infectious diseases. Older people, young children, and pregnant women are at particular risk.

“In the summer of 2022, 60,000-70,000 [people] died in Europe because of heat,” Julie Berckmans, PhD, European Environment Agency (EEA) climate risk and adaptation expert, told Medscape Medical News. “In 2023, it was 47,000 people. These numbers could increase substantially in the coming decades. To avoid this, effective actions have to be implemented to protect vulnerable people.”

In their letter, the Pan-European Commission on Climate and Health highlighted the need for HHAPs to save lives and prevent further climate decline.

HHAPs provide a framework for reducing the health impacts of extreme heat. They focus on eight core elements: a governing structure for heat-health action, warning systems, care for vulnerable populations, heat-health communications planning, health system resilience, reduced heat exposure, surveillance, and a process for review and improvement, Vladimir Kendrovski, MD, PhD, World Health Organization (WHO)/Europe technical officer for climate change and health, told Medscape Medical News.

At present, 21 of the 38 countries belonging to the EEA network, Eionet, have HHAPs in place. While this is encouraging, said Kendrovski, accelerating their development and implementation across Europe remains a “critical priority.”

Many countries began to implement HHAPs in response to the 2003 heatwave — the hottest period in continental Europe since at least 1540, claiming more than 70,000 lives. France and Italy , for example, saw significant declines in heat-related deaths after implementing preventative measures like warning system s, information campaigns for the public , and a ir conditioning equipment and emergency protocols for health centers and retirement homes.

Some measures, however, are more widespread than others. Kendrovski noted that a survey of member states in the region found that long-term urban planning and real-time surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation are still lacking.

Andreas Hoy, PhD, senior expert and climate scientist at the Stockholm Environment Institute Tallinn, in Tallinn, Estonia, noted that the technical components of early meteorological warning systems have been significantly updated in recent years, thus enabling better warning systems. However, he added, an absence of formal standards has led to wide variations in HHAP structures, objectives, and execution.

“This inconsistency often produces fragmented efforts and leaves major gaps in funding, vulnerability assessments, and long-term resilience planning,” he said.

While improved infrastructure is important, community engagement is key toward ensuring it is used properly to ultimately reduce deaths, Jan Semenza, PhD, project manager at the Department of Epidemiology and Global Health at Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden, told Medscape Medical News.

Toward this end, he recommends a “lateral” as opposed to “vertical” approach to public health : rather than eliminating one health threat at a time, such as polio through vaccination campaigns, lateral approaches enhance community cohesion for a more self-organized and thus agile collective response to disasters, including heatwaves.

Measures may include community-based surveillance, health education, and projects like establishing urban gardens to cool air through transpiration or painting roofs green to reduce rooftop temperatures.

“One thing we found from our research in Chicago,” said Semenza, “is that people who have social connections, participate in church communities, or even have a pet that allows you to go outside and connect with people — these are the ones that are more likely to survive. If you're isolated, nobody looks after you.” 

Semenza added that urban planning should also be taken into account and recommended the creation of more green spaces to offset heating from cement and concrete.

Hoy noted that while long-term solutions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to prevent further heating are necessary, public awareness campaigns are still needed in the short-term to help people stay safe during heatwaves.

“Providing clear and simple guidance on how to stay safe during a heatwave can save lives: such as staying hydrated, seeking shade, and looking out for elderly neighbors, friends, and family members,” he told Medscape Medical News.

In terms of immediate solutions, Ilona M. Otto, PhD, deputy director at the Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change at the University of Graz, Graz, Austria, recommends using public spaces and buildings, such as libraries, as cooling centers, in addition to providing access to drinking stations, improved insulation, and assistance to vulnerable people living alone.

Regulations for working conditions may also need to be adjusted, she said, to ensure that those working in difficult conditions can take more breaks, have more access to water, and perhaps stop working at the hottest times of the day.

Healthcare professionals also have a key role in implementing HHAPs, Rachel Lowe, PhD, Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies Research Professor at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, told Medscape Medical News.

“Health professionals can detect and treat heat-sensitive and climate-related illnesses early and educate patients on prevention. They also play a key role in public awareness, surveillance, and advocating for greener, more resilient health systems that can withstand climate pressures and reduce the carbon footprint of the health sector,” she said.

The WHO Regional Office for Europe is currently developing new guidance for HHAPs, which is expected to be published in Spring 2026.

Berckmans, Kendrovski, Lowe, and Semenza reported no relevant financial relationships. Otto noted that a part of her work has been carried out within the HIGH Horizons project, funded by the European Union's Horizon Research and Innovation programme. Their project partner, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, is funded by UK Research & Innovation. Hoy declined to disclose any relevant financial relationships.

 August 21, 2025  

Individuals diagnosed with endometriosis showed a 42% higher risk for self-harm, overdose, or suicide than matched control individuals, with risk particularly elevated among those with minimal prior psychiatric care. The study of 56,053 endometriosis patients and 112,106 control participants revealed that those with no or minimal previous mental health services had nearly double the risk.

“These findings highlight the importance of considering mental health needs for patients newly diagnosed with endometriosis,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Peter Thiel, MD, MPH, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. It was published online in Obstetrics & Gynecology.

The administrative data used may be misclassified and lacks clinical information such as endometriosis severity, treatment responses, and lag between symptom onset and diagnosis. These gaps limit a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between endometriosis and self-harm outcomes.

Emerging insights into the gut-lung axis continue to open new possibilities for managing chronic respiratory diseases, from cystic fibrosis (CF) in the youngest patients to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in older adults. Despite growing evidence linking gut health to respiratory disease pathogenesis, these findings are not yet ready for routine clinical application. Still, they underscore the value of discussing diet and nutrition with patients as part of broader strategies to optimize overall health.

“For most lung diseases, the majority of the literature on gut health that changes lung disease pathogenesis is from research studies,” explained Rachel Scheraga, MD, pulmonologist and critical care physician at Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland. Although studies have explored gut metabolites and lung microbiome changes associated with gut dysbiosis, they cannot yet lead to evidence-based dietary interventions for patients without further clinical trials in humans.

But there are some practical gut-lung connections that currently impact practice. For instance, when gut dysfunction is suspected, pulmonologists at Cleveland Clinic refer patients to gastroenterology to rule out other contributing conditions such as reflux. This is an especially important step for patients with end-stage lung disease awaiting transplant, given the link between poor gut health and an increased risk for transplant rejection.

“The main gap is for the pulmonologist to determine what context the gut may be contributing to either the acute or chronic disease and the proper time to screen for gut dysfunction,” Scheraga said. “I believe it is important to start with translational research to determine the cause and effect of the contribution of gut dysfunction to lung disease. Once it is determined what specifically the gut is doing to cause lung disease progression, then clinical research can be performed to modify this factor and see if the lung disease improves.”

At the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth in Hanover, New Hampshire, George A. O'Toole, PhD, is exploring the association between the gut microbiome and CF.

“Linking the gut to the lung is a complex process that requires a team of researchers in the clinic and at the bench,” he shared. “Bench scientists need to understand the clinical issues, and clinicians can help translate observations from patient care into laboratory studies to better define these connections. This area of research must be collaborative — and pulmonologists play a key role.”

While many studies have documented associations between gut dysbiosis and chronic lung disease, the mechanisms remain poorly defined. O'Toole points to several key questions:

O'Toole's work in CF in pediatric populations has validated links between gut pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infections in infants and children. This work has been done in close collaboration with Juliette Madan, MD, MS, and Julie Sanville, DO, physician-scientists at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire.

“In our CF model, we established the link between gut and airway, and we know this link is driven by propionate,” he said. “I'm excited to understand how propionate tunes the airway response. We are also developing probiotic strategies that I think could have great potential.”

“Understanding this connection lets us develop new means to help address airway disease. We have the opportunity to improve patient outcomes.”

As diet and nutritional status are recognized as modulators of lung health through the gut-lung axis, personalized nutrition has the potential to be as complementary to pharmacologic therapy, said Inês Brandão, PhD, Head of Research at Centro de Apoio Tecnológico Agro Alimentar, Castelo Branco, Portugal, a Portugal-based research and innovation center focused on the agri-food sector.

Adequate protein intake, anti-inflammatory, fiber-rich diets, and the use of probiotics, prebiotics, or symbiotics can help support asthma, COPD, and other respiratory diseases, she said, adding the need for well-designed clinical trials, validated biomarkers, and multidisciplinary care teams.

“Encouraging patients to adopt anti-inflammatory, fiber-rich diets and consider probiotic or prebiotic supplementation may support gut microbiota health and reduce lung inflammation,” she said. “This represents, beyond any doubt, low-risk and cost-effective strategies.”

“Moving forward,” Brandão said, “building a shared understanding through collaboration between researchers, clinicians, and nutrition experts will be essential to provide clear, practical guidance for pulmonologists.”

Brandão, O'Toole, and Scheraga reported having no relevant financial relationships.

A new international study led by researchers at Moffitt Cancer Center, the Karolinska Institutet and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center has uncovered a surprising mechanism of resistance to immunotherapy: cancer's ability to injure nearby nerves.

The study, published in Nature, shows that when cancer cells infiltrate and damage tumor-associated nerves, it triggers an inflammatory response that ultimately weakens the effectiveness of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. This widely used treatment works by unleashing the body's immune system to attack tumors, but many patients fail to respond.

Our findings demonstrate that cancer-induced nerve injury is not just a bystander effect, it directly shapes the immune environment in ways that allow tumors to evade treatment. Importantly, we also found that this process is reversible.""

Kenneth Tsai, M.D., Ph.D., co-corresponding author of the study and co-director of Moffitt's Donald A. Adam Melanoma and Skin Cancer Center of Excellence

Using patient samples including those from recent neoadjuvant therapy trials and preclinical models of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer, the team showed that cancer cells degrade the protective myelin sheath of nearby nerves. The injured neurons release inflammatory signals, including IL-6 and type 1 interferons, which is able to be repaired initially, but over time creates a chronically suppressive tumor microenvironment.

The researchers tested several strategies to disrupt this cycle. Resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy was overcome by removing nerves that transmit pain, blocking key neuronal injury signals, or combining anti-PD-1 with drugs that target the IL-6 pathway.

""This work highlights a new role for the nervous system in cancer progression and resistance to therapy,"" Tsai said. ""By targeting the signaling that follows nerve injury, we may be able to restore the immune system's ability to fight cancer.""

The discovery could lead to new treatment combinations that improve outcomes for patients whose tumors invade and grow along nerves, a common feature in several cancer types associated with poor prognosis.

""This is an example of how studying the cross talk between cancer, nerves and the immune system can reveal entirely new actionable vulnerabilities,"" Tsai said.

The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health (CA016672, P30CA016672 and P30-CA076292).

The European Regulation list on mandatory labelling of foods includes 14 allergenic foods. Research published in Clinical & Experimental Allergy has identified eight additional foods frequently involved in food-induced anaphylaxis. 

The research was based on an analysis of food-induced anaphylaxis cases reported to the Allergy Vigilance Network from 2002–2023. Allergenic foods involved in ≥1% of cases and not included in the European Regulation list included goat's and sheep's milk (2.8% of cases), buckwheat (2.4%), peas and lentil (1.8%), alpha-gal (1.7%), pine nut (1.6%), kiwi (1.5%), beehive products (1.0%), and apple (1.0%). 

Due to their frequency, severity, recurrence, and potential for hidden exposure, the study's investigators propose that four of these-goat's and sheep's milk, buckwheat, peas-lentil, and pine nut-be considered for inclusion on the European mandatory labelling of foods list. The recurrence rate (the same allergen causing several anaphylactic accidents in the same patient) for these foods ranged from 7.3% for peas–lentil to 56% for goat's and sheep's milk. 

In our series of nearly 3,000 food anaphylaxis cases, 413 were caused by one of these eight 'emerging food allergens' without mandatory labelling, with 2 deaths. We therefore believe it is time to review the list of the 14 foods with mandatory labelling to include at least the most severe of these emerging food allergens.""

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — The Colorado Rapids announced today that the club has signed U.S. Men's National Team midfielder Paxten Aaronson from Germany's Eintracht Frankfurt to a five-year contract through 2030. Aaronson joins Colorado in a club-record transfer and will occupy a Designated Player slot on the Rapids' roster.

“Bringing Paxten to Colorado highlights our ambition and belief in his ability to impact our team immediately,” said Colorado Rapids President Pádraig Smith. “He has proven himself in Europe, gained valuable experience on the international stage with the U.S. Men's National Team, and brings a dynamic, creative presence to our midfield. He is the exact type of young, hungry player we want to build around at this club, and we are delighted to welcome him to Colorado as we strengthen a team capable of competing at the highest level.”

Aaronson, 21, most recently spent the 2024–25 season on loan at FC Utrecht in the Netherlands' Eredivisie, where he recorded nine goals and six assists in 37 league appearances. His breakout campaign earned him a nomination as a finalist for the Johan Cruyff Talent of the Year award. He previously spent the second half of the 2023–24 season on loan with Dutch Eredivisie side Vitesse, scoring four goals in 14 appearances. In 2023, he joined Eintracht Frankfurt from the Philadelphia Union and made his Bundesliga debut in March of that year against Union Berlin, going on to make 23 appearances for the club while scoring one goal and providing three assists. He was also part of the squad that finished as the runner-up in the 2022–23 DFB-Pokal (German Cup) and participated in the 2023–24 UEFA Europa Conference League.

The Medford, New Jersey, native began his professional career with the Philadelphia Union after signing a Homegrown Player contract in August 2020. He went on to make 37 regular-season appearances and score four goals for the club, featuring in the 2021 Concacaf Champions League semifinals and the 2022 MLS Cup Final. He also featured for Philadelphia Union II, making 24 appearances, scoring six goals and delivering five assists.

At the international level, Aaronson has earned four senior caps for the United States since debuting in January 2023. He was part of the U.S. squad that won the 2023–24 Concacaf Nations League, reached the final of the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup, and represented the United States at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, where he started all four matches and contributed one goal and one assist as the team advanced to the quarterfinals. He also featured for the U-23s with three appearances and one goal.

At the youth level, Aaronson recorded 13 appearances, eight goals, and one assist with the U.S. U-20 Men's Youth National Team. He led the side to the 2022 Concacaf U-20 Championship, finishing as the tournament's top scorer with seven goals while winning both the Golden Boot and Golden Ball awards, and earning a spot on the tournament's Best XI. His standout performances earned him a nomination as a finalist for the 2022 Chipotle U.S. Soccer Young Male Player of the Year.

TRANSFER TRACKER STATUS: Signing

The Colorado Rapids have acquired US men's national team midfielder Paxten Aaronson from German Bundesliga side Eintracht Frankfurt, the club announced Thursday.

The 21-year-old Philadelphia Union homegrown product is under contract through 2030. He will occupy a Designated Player roster spot and arrives for a club-record fee that reportedly could reach $8.5 million.

Aaronson, who spent 2021-22 with Philly before moving overseas, helps replace Djordje Mihailovic. Earlier this month, Colorado traded the USMNT midfielder to Toronto FC for a club-record $8 million fee plus add-ons.

“Bringing Paxten to Colorado highlights our ambition and belief in his ability to impact our team immediately,” said Rapids president Pádraig Smith. “He has proven himself in Europe, gained valuable experience on the international stage with the US men's national team, and brings a dynamic, creative presence to our midfield.

""He is the exact type of young, hungry player we want to build around at this club, and we are delighted to welcome him to Colorado as we strengthen a team capable of competing at the highest level.”

During his first MLS stint, Aaronson scored four goals in 41 appearances for Philly. His rapid rise prompted a transfer to Frankfurt for reportedly $4 million plus add-ons.

While in Europe, Aaronson tallied 1g/3a in 23 games for Frankfurt. He also completed two loans in the Dutch Eredivisie, combining for 13g/6a in 51 matches across FC Utrecht and Vitesse Arnhem.

Internationally, Aaronson has four USMNT caps and scored once in four games at the 2024 Summer Olympics. He won Golden Boot and Golden Ball awards as the US won the 2022 Concacaf U-20 Championship, scoring a tournament-best seven goals.

Rapids fans, he's ready for you!Hear from our newest Burgundy Boy and meet him tonight at Catalyst 🗣️#Rapids96 pic.twitter.com/dfXhtaydOE

Aaronson is the Rapids' latest player with USMNT ties, joining goalkeeper Zack Steffen, midfielder Cole Bassett, and defenders Sam Vines and Reggie Cannon.

After Mihailovic's departure, forwards Rafael Navarro (11g/4a) and Darren Yapi (7g/2a) are Colorado's top remaining scorers.

Now in their second season under head coach Chris Armas, Colorado are seeking a second straight Audi MLS Cup Playoffs trip. They're currently seventh in the Western Conference (36 points) as Decision Day approaches.

Five short weeks after winning the Club World Cup at MetLife Stadium, Chelsea returned to competitive play at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, banners celebrating their latest championship adorned around their stadium. The Blues, though, swapped an impressive 3-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain last month for a sluggish 0-0 draw against Crystal Palace, the scoreline a perfect reflection of the performance.

External factors likely played a sizable role in Chelsea's underwhelming showing on Sunday, the Club World Cup creating wonky preseason schedules for the European teams that made deep runs. Enzo Maresca's side, for example, played an 11-month season, took three weeks off, and had just 13 days of preseason preparation before facing Palace on Sunday, while the opponent had a much more traditional build-up. Maresca did not feel his side were underprepared as a result, but it was hard to ignore the circumstances.

""I don't think [the team was unprepared] because, until the end, we competed,"" Maresca said. ""We tried to win the game. I think we had some chances at the end with Estevao, with Andrey Santos. So that showed that probably we compete overall quite good. For sure, [Palace] have already played seven, eight games. And for us, last week we played two games, but we tried to share minutes. So the real game for us was today. But for sure, slowly, slowly we're going to be better.""

Even then, Chelsea have room for improvement as they prepare to face West Ham United on Friday, a trip to the London Stadium offering a perfect opportunity to put Sunday's performance in the past. While Palace were organized defensively and provided real hurdles for the Blues' attackers, the Hammers are unlikely to pose the same challenge. West Ham are coming off a 3-0 loss to newly-promoted Sunderland, which could be the first sign of a troubling season ahead for a team that has not refreshed much this summer and poses a limited attacking threat.

Chelsea were clearly the more dominant attacking team on Sunday, when they outshot Palace 19 to 11 and generated almost a full expected goal more than the Eagles. It was a performance that was more about quantity than quality, though – the Blues took just three shots on goal, unideal no matter the preseason disruptions. It offered a stark reminder that despite the Club World Cup triumph and the UEFA Europa Conference League win before that, Maresca's Chelsea may have plenty of potential but are still a great unknown.

Maresca boasts a bloated squad jam-packed with attackers, but has yet to figure out what his preferred combination is yet. Considering the circumstances – specifically, an ownership group that is unusually eager to sign new players – it is understandable that the manager has not cracked the code just yet. Cole Palmer has earned the right to be a regular starter but the rest of the spots just might be up for grabs.

The journey to figure out Chelsea's first-choice attacking unit has been a constant feature of Maresca's tenure at the club but the Club World Cup run offers important context thanks to the introduction of a batch of new players. Liam Delap, who chose Chelsea despite interest from several clubs around Europe, was a starter at the start of the summer tournament but by the time the trophy was in the Blues' sights, Joao Pedro was in the mix. He joined the team midway through the tournament and notched three goals in three games, including one in the final, and translated that into a start on Sunday against Palace.

Joao Pedro was at the top of a 4-2-3-1 that included Palmer, as well as Pedro Neto and Jamie Gittens on the wings, but the returns were not spectacular. Joao Pedro took just two shots in 73 minutes, a throwback to his average returns during his two years with Brighton and Hove Albion. The less-than-exciting outing for Chelsea, though, perhaps opens the door for Delap to earn a starting role while 18-year-old Estevao Willian may play a sizable role himself this season after making a 36-minute cameo on Sunday.

Friday's match at West Ham, then, feels like the unofficial start of auditions to be one of Chelsea's first-choice attackers, all of whom will be tasked with helping the Blues live up to the hype they created last season.

June 15, 2026. That's the big day. The beginning of the FIFA World Cup 2026. The event is being described as one of the biggest in Washington history.

“The region is expecting hundreds of millions of dollars of economic impact. We're expecting three-quarters of a million people, visitors from around the world,” Pierce County Executive Ryan Mello said.

Mello, along with other county officials and representatives from Pierce Transit, held a summit Wednesday morning. County leaders outlined their plans to ensure the event's success, creating an enjoyable experience for visitors who are expected to extend their stays to explore everything Washington has to offer.

“We got to put ourselves in the shoes of customers — customers who are not from here, customers who don't speak our language, and help serve them so they can have a great time,” Mello said.

One of the biggest challenges for the county during this event will be transportation. Streets will be crowded, parking lots will be filled. Organizers said public transportation will be the easiest and safest way to get to and from matches, and around western Washington. Pierce Transit expects demand could be higher than ever.

“We expect it's going to almost double our ridership. And we're fortunate that the state, in this last session, came up with some money for transit agencies,” Mike Griffus, CEO of Pierce Transit, said.

Griffus said they also expect money from the federal government to help offset any additional costs of moving people where they want to go, when they want to go.

“The county's transit plan during the event will include buses, trains, light rail, and ferries. There will be multi-day Orca passes, so visitors won't need to pay a fare every time they want to change locations or get to and from matches. There will also be ADA accommodations,” he added.

Preliminary economic impact analysis shows the event could bring in $652.6 million in direct spending, $929 million in total economic impact, 20,762 total jobs, and $106.5 million in state and local taxes generated.

Proper planning now will create a successful event.

“How to make these safe games. How to help move people around safely and strategically, and smoothly, and how we benefit from hosting these games long into the future,” Mello said.

Last Word On Tennis

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

Munar – Fucsovics: 21.08.2025 22:00 CEST
H2H: 0-1

Jaume Munar has won three of his last five matches. The Spaniard struggled on hard courts this season so far. Last week in Cincinnati, Munar lost to Comesana in the opening round in straight sets. This week in Winston-Salem, Munar demolished Bellucci in the opening round. He won in straight sets, whilst losing only four games altogether. Munar lost his serve at the very beginning of the match, but quickly turned it around. Other than that, the Spaniard dominated throughout the match. In the second round, Munar defeated Sonego in three sets.

Marton Fucsovics has won three of his last five matches. This week in Winston-Salem, Fucsovics defeated Gaston in straight sets comfortably. He served well throughout the match. In the second round, the Hungarian defeated Griekspoor in three sets. In the deciding third set, he served great, not offering any breakpoints. In the 1/8-Finals, Fucsovics won against Bautista-Agut in straight sets. He offered and saved only one breakpoint.

According to the bookies, this will be a 50-50 matchup, but we disagree. Fucsovics is in great form and has dominated in every match this week. Munar had a rough battle against Sonego. We expect Fucsovics to be a better player tonight.

That being said, Fucsovics winning is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Marton Fucsovics winning @2.00 @bet365

Bu – Van de Zandschulp: 22.08.2025 02:00 CEST
H2H: first meeting

Yunchaokete Bu has won three of his last five matches. Last week in Cincinnati, Bu lost to Fonseca in the opening round in three tight sets. This week, Bu defeated Tseng in three tight sets in the opening round after playing for over three hours. In the second round, Bu upset Tsitsipas, winning in straight sets. Navone also had no answer for his game in the 1/8-Finals. The Chinese was great under pressure, saving six out of seven breakpoints.

Botic Van de Zandschulp has won four of his last five matches. This week in Winston-Salem, the Dutchman defeated Walton in the opening round in three tight sets. After losing the opening set 2-6, Van de Zandschulp stepped up his level and turned the match around after playing for almost three hours. In the second round, Arnaldi had no chance against him. Van de Zandschulp served extraordinarily well, not offering any breakpoints. Baez won the opening set 6-0 in the 1/8-Finals. However, the Dutchman stayed calm and turned the match around. He hopes to go deep this week to cement his top 100 status and maybe even come closer to the top 50 in the rankings.

According to the bookies, this will be a 50-50 matchup, but we disagree. Van de Zandschulp has been one of the most inconsistent players this season. On the other hand, Bu dominated this week in Winston-Salem. He defeated Tsitsipas and Navone in straight sets and will be confident coming into this match. We expect him to be a better player tonight.

That being said, Bu winning is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Yunchaokete Bu winning @1.80 @bet365

Carlos Alcaraz's bid for a second US Open crown could run through a blockbuster semi-final showdown with Novak Djokovic.

Fresh from his title run in Cincinnati, Alcaraz will start his campaign at the hard-court major against big-serving American Reilly Opelka, it was revealed following Thursday's draw. In the last four, the 2022 US Open champion could meet four-time winner Djokovic, who first plays #NextGenATP Learner Tien.

View the draw. 

Djokovic leads Alcaraz 5-3 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, having rallied to a four-set win in their latest meeting in the Australian Open quarter-finals in January. Seventh seed Djokovic has not competed since reaching the semi-finals at Wimbledon five weeks ago.

Top seed and defending champion Jannik Sinner, who is chasing a third major title of the season, opens his campaign against Czech Vit Kopriva. The 24-year-old Italian is seeded to meet last year's semi-finalist Jack Draper in the quarter-finals. The Briton opens against a qualifier or lucky loser.

The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Sinner is on a semi-final collision course with third seed Alexander Zverev. The three-time major finalist, who fell to Sinner in this year's Australian Open championship match, begins against Alejandro Tabilo.

Alcaraz may run a gauntlet of high-calibre opposition to make it through his quarter, which features former US Open champion Daniil Medvedev, recent Toronto winner Ben Shelton and 2022 runner-up Casper Ruud.



Sinner may also run into early danger in the top half of the draw. Alexei Popyrin, who last year stunned reigning champion Djokovic, is a potential second-round opponent.

The 10th-seeded Lorenzo Musetti, who is currently ninth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and aiming to debut at the Nitto ATP Finals, starts against 6' 8” Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard. The Italian is seeded to meet Draper in the fourth round.

Last year's finalist Taylor Fritz has fallen in Djokovic's quarter, which includes three young stars who all competed in last year's Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. As well as Djokovic's first-round opponent Tien, Joao Fonseca, who won the 2023 US Open boys' singles title, plays Miomir Kecmanovic and 28th seed Alex Michelsen faces Francisco Comesana.

Alcaraz will hope to return to winning ways at Flushing Meadows following his shock second-round defeat to Botic van de Zandschulp last year. The 22-year-old Spaniard arrives with a Tour-leading 54 wins and six titles in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Van de Zandschulp could cause 11th seed Holger Rune problems in their first-round clash. Alexander Bublik will face 2014 champion Marin Cilic in his first appearance of the North American hard-court swing, while Sebastian Korda begins against Cameron Norrie.

21st August 2025

Victoria Mboko has been backed to make her Grand Slam breakthrough at the US Open following her remarkable rise so far in 2025.

The 18-year-old started the year at No. 333 in the WTA Rankings, but she won 22 consecutive ITF matches between January and February and, coupled with a first-ever WTA Tour-level match win at the Miami Open, she surged to No. 156 by the end of March.

Mboko then made her Grand Slam debut at Roland Garros, reaching the third round while she also made it to the second round at Wimbledon.

But bigger and better things were still to come as she enjoyed a fairytale run at her home event, the Canadian Open, after being awarded a wildcard into the main draw.

The teenager stunned 2020 Australian Open winner Sofia Kenin in the second round, top seed reigning French Open champion Coco Gauff in the fourth round and 2022 Wimbledon winner Elena Rybakina in the semi-final.

She took on former world No. 1 and four-time major winner Naomi Osaka in the final and overcame a poor start to win 2-6, 6-4, 6-1 to win her first top-level singles trophy.

Having started the Montreal event at No. 85 in the rankings, she rose to a new career-high of No. 24, which resulted in an automatic entry into the US Open main draw.

With her New York ticket secured, Mboko and her team opted to skip the Cincinnati Open as she struggled with a wrist injury during the latter stages of the Canada event.

During a Sky Sports Tennis panel prediction piece, tennis legend Martina Navratilova backed the Canadian to reach the business end of the hard-court Grand Slam at Flushing Meadows.

""After Montreal, I'd say Victoria Mboko has announced her arrival loud and clear and must be considered a threat to go deep,"" she stated.

However, the 18-time major singles champion also feels French Open surprise package Lois Boisson could cause some upsets at the US Open after she reached the semi-final in Paris and broke into the top 50.

Navratilova added: ""Lois Boisson played great tennis on the clay at the French Open. She was an eye-opening experience and I think she can do some damage at the US Open. Her game should transfer beautifully for the hardcourts and Karolina Muchova. If she is healthy and playing well then she can beat anybody.""

Fellow pundits Marion Bartoli, Naomi Cavaday and Jonathan Overend also went with Mboko to cause a surprise with the latte stating: ""Victoria Mboko - what a talent! Skipping Cincinnati means she will be fresh for Flushing Meadows.

""She'll be able to draw on those memories from Montreal. She's got the game and this is someone who has risen rapidly and is now ready to make her Grand Slam breakthrough.""

PETRA KVITOVA is set to retire after the US Open – nine years on from the horror knife attack that left her career hanging in the balance.

Two-time former Wimbledon champion Kvitova, 35, has been a popular figure on the WTA Tour for more than a decade.

In December 2016, Kvitova was shockingly attacked in her own home by a man purporting to be a utility worker.

The Czech star suffered a deep laceration in her left hand and required urgent, career-saving surgery.

Five months of intense rehabilitation followed, before Kvitova was able to launch the start of what she calls her ""second career"" at the French Open in 2017.

The big-hitting lefty has since enjoyed a ""second career"" that most players would envy.

She reached the Australian Open final in 2019, narrowly losing in three sets to an inspired Naomi Osaka, before battling to the semis at the 2020 French Open.

Kvitova has won an incredible 31 career titles, including 12 since her traumatic knife attack.

In 2024 she took a break from the rigours of life on tour to have her first child, with son Petr born in July of last year.

The inspirational star returned to action earlier this year, but is now to call time on her brilliant career at the US Open.

Reflecting on her journey back to the top of the sport ahead of her final tournament, Kvitova told The Guardian: ""I knew I was a big fighter on the court but at that time I realised how I am an even bigger fighter in a totally different version of myself.

""That was great, even though it was very tough to play tennis. I cried on the court, I had really bad flashbacks, I was having nightmares.

""So it really wasn't easy. It took a while, but it's all good now. There was a big question mark, can I play tennis or not?

""And I could. It was my second career. It was amazing.""

On her motivations for hanging up her racquet, Kvitova added: ""I'm totally ready. I'm not regretting anything.

""I still love tennis but everything else, waiting for the practices, waiting for the car, waiting for a match, it's just tiring.

""And having a son, it's a totally different life. I just want to spend more time with him as well.""

New York will next week have a chance to wave goodbye to truly one of the great players of the last decade, and arguably the most inspirational.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","'Bold' US Open gets everyone talking about mixed doubles","https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/c5yejpmlpj8o","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 07:51:46 GMT","

Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu were the star pairing of the US Open mixed doubles - but lost in the first round

""There is only one thing in life worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.""

Oscar Wilde was not talking about mixed doubles tennis. But his quote could easily be applied to an event which some felt needed new life breathing into it.

The US Open's decision to revamp its mixed doubles - enticing singles superstars with lucrative cash incentives, a shortened format and slot before the other main draws - certainly got people chatting.

Previously, it would be lost and largely forgotten in the midst of finals weekend.

The United States Tennis Association (USTA) opted to make an innovative move - but it divided opinion among those who love the sport.

""I know it created a lot of reaction and [it was] somewhat bold to do it,"" said three-time Grand Slam singles finalist Casper Ruud, who teamed up with six-time major champion Iga Swiatek and finished as runners-up.

""You can't argue that it's not been great for the fans.""

'Mission completed' - doubles specialists win US Open mixed title

Was attracting the big names an effective way to attract more eyeballs on the sport? Yes.

Did it also rip away a 138-year tradition and rob most specialist doubles players of a shot at a major title? Yes.

In the end, the curtain-raising event - spread over two days in what is traditionally qualifying week - led to a fitting final on which polarising narratives hung.

Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, the defending champions and only recognised doubles pairing in the 16-team event, were aiming to win for the greater good of their discipline.

One of their peers, Australian player Ellen Perez, spoke for many when saying she had ""never felt more Italian"" as she supported them.

Losing to Swiatek and Ruud - who had never played together before this week - would have been a blow for the doubles community.

Instead, Errani and Vavassori's triumph made the case to find room for more doubles specialists if, as expected, the format returns next year.

""We showed that doubles is a great product and in the future we need more marketing and visibility,"" Vavassori pleaded to the US Open decision-makers.

Errani and Vavassori have won both their Grand Slam mixed doubles titles in New York

Ultimately, the two-day doubles party - where courtside DJs pumped up the extremely healthy crowds and encouraged a raucous atmosphere - will be considered a success.

Britain's Jack Draper, who is ranked fifth in the ATP singles rankings but has limited doubles experience, said he thought it was a ""great"" event.

""If I wasn't playing the mixed here, I'd be training. I prefer playing on a big court in front of people. It gets your eye in quicker,"" he said.

After the opening day's action, Draper made a Freudian slip which initially proved quite telling.

Draper was playfully scolded by his partner Jessica Pegula for describing the new-look event as an ""exhibition"" - a word used disparagingly by its detractors.

But, following their semi-final exit, Draper was keen to point out the event did not feel like a 'hit and giggle' after all.

""[On Tuesday] there were times where it felt a little bit more that way from our opponents,"" he said.

""Whereas tonight we were in the changing rooms, you're seeing Iga and Casper, they're fully dialled in. It was intense.""

The fans on the ground in New York also demonstrated their appetite for something different.

On the opening day, the 25,000-seater Arthur Ashe Stadium was about two-thirds full when A-List pairing Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz walked out to a pop star-style reception.

For Wednesday's semi-finals and final, where face-value tickets ranged from $50 (£37) to $262 (£195), it was just short of a full house with only a sliver of empty seats at the very back.

Ticket-holders Hilary Hamm and Maria Segovia - ardent tennis fans who have previously travelled from New York to Wimbledon and the Australian Open - admitted they have rarely watched mixed doubles in the past.

""Moving it from finals weekend and making it a standalone event caught our attention,"" said 32-year-old Maria. ""If it is going to increase crowd engagement, then I'd definitely to see more events like this.""

Hilary, also 32, added: ""I think it's been amazing. Watching the women leading the male partners has been particularly inspiring and shows tennis needs a strong mixed gender competition featuring the stars.""

Thousands of New York fans were excited to watch the world's leading singles players turn out in the mixed doubles

The reaction of fans online was more mixed, with some readers' comments on the BBC Sport website's pre-tournament analysis piece particularly critical.

One described the event as ""a complete farce"", while another said it was a ""shameful idea"".

A poll in the piece showed 70% of our readers thought the overhaul was a bad move.

The good news for purists is the other three Grand Slams - the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon - are thought unlikely to follow suit in the near future.

Tennis Australia is equally as bold as its American counterpart, but does not have the same financial clout to offer the mountain of prize money and sweetening appearance fees.

Neither does the French Open or Wimbledon. Also, the two oldest Grand Slam tournaments are generally more reluctant to deviate from time-honoured traditions.

Draper, 23, is among the group who would like to see more change, saying it would be ""cool"" if all the majors adopted a similar approach.

He can be sure the power-holders in Melbourne, Paris and London will have been watching the New York trendsetters with intrigue.

            This wasn't just a victory for Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori. It also felt like a victory for all doubles tennis players.
    


            Up against some of the game's biggest singles stars, Errani and Vavassori successfully defended their US Open mixed doubles title, defeating Iga Świątek and Casper Ruud 6-3, 5-7, 10-6 in Wednesday's final.
    


            Critics of the reimagined format will feel a sense of justice that the Italian duo, the only doubles specialists in the competition, triumphed at the end of the condensed, two-day competition, earning $1,000,000 in prize money – five times more than last year.
    


            “These two days will be really important for doubles in the future because we showed that doubles players are great players,” Vavassori told reporters after the match. “I think this product can grow in the future … With better marketing (it) can become something better.”
    


‘Don't call it a grand slam': Why has the US Open's new mixed doubles format been so controversial?



            This year's mixed doubles was moved to the week before the tournament itself, giving the world's top-ranked singles players like Świątek and Ruud the chance to take part.
    


            The 16 pairs mostly played a shortened format of first to four games across three sets, with no advantage after deuce and a 10-point tie break instead of a full third set. Only in the final did the scoring go up to six games for the first two sets.
    


            Inside a packed-out Arthur Ashe Stadium, a tie-break was ultimately needed to crown Errani and Vavassori as champions, the title sealed when Świątek failed to return a tricky half volley at the net.
    


            For Errani and Vavassori, it capped off victories against Elena Rybakina and Taylor Fritz, Karolína Muchová and Andrey Rublev, and Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison. The final was the only time that they had dropped a set.
    


            “I think in doubles we showed it's very important to know how to play doubles,” Errani told reporters. “In doubles, it's not just serving good, hitting good, returning good. There are many other things that are not easy.
    


            “We show that you have to think, be smart,” she added. “In doubles, there are more things than hitting the ball. Singles has other things and doubles has another things. We show that we are good at doubles.”
    


            This was Errani and Vavassori's third grand slam mixed doubles title, adding to victories at last year's US Open and this year's French Open.
    


            Their path to the 2025 trophy was hardly smooth. Back in February when the new format was announced, they released a joint statement calling it a “pseudo-exhibition” and “profound injustice” which “disrespect(s) an entire category of players.”
    


            For their part, US Open organizers said that the new format would “elevate mixed doubles with a bigger spotlight and provide a greater opportunity to inspire more people to play and grow the sport.”

            On Wednesday, Vavassori admitted that he didn't think the pair would have been given a place in the tournament had they not released that statement.
    


            However, many viewed the changed format as a success, drawing in bigger crowds who were eager to see some of the game's biggest names – the likes of Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu, Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper – play alongside and against each other.
    


            “Arguably more crazy almost than a singles match … super loud,” was how Pegula, a singles finalist at last year's US Open, described the atmosphere.
    


            “I think people love to see people competing and going hard,” she added. “They come because they love tennis and they want to watch. I think the format, honestly, it was really fun … Seeing us compete in a different way was definitely exciting.”
    


            Draper concurred, explaining that the whole event was “a bit of a spectacle” in front of a big crowd, which included fashion industry icon Anna Wintour.
    


            “People love sport,” he said. “People especially in New York, they love getting into it. They love just watching good points and watching people competing hard and trying to win. I think they respect that. It's like a really nice environment to be in.”
    


            It remains to be seen what format next year's mixed doubles will take, though Vavassori suggested that they could expand to 32 teams to include more doubles specialists.
    


            “The schedule is very tough to organize. We have so many tournaments,” he said. “But I think maybe one more round and you can put (in) so many other good players.
    


            “Maybe you can put also the narrative about singles against doubles. Today was two doubles players at the top of the game and two singles players at the top of the game. It was a good matchup also for the crowd.”

The US Open of tennis just dramatically overhauled the mixed doubles. A new short format, held before the grand slam's official start, with a huge prize money increase and lots and lots of singles stars. Did they just save mixed doubles or did they just kill it?

The US Open mixed doubles event featured an innovative new format, with many of the world's best singles players competing and four rounds across two days. One thing remained the same: the champions.

Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori completed their successful title defence Wednesday evening with a 6-3, 5-7, 10-6 victory against Casper Ruud and Iga Swiatek. The Italians lost just one set in the tournament to share the $1 million champion's cheque.

“I want to say thanks to my partner. We are doing something [amazing] in these two years,” Vavassori said during the trophy ceremony. “I have to say thanks for the energy you put [on] the court. It's unbelievable for me to play with you, thank you.” 

“Andrea, you are too strong, too good. I am enjoying so much playing with you,"" Errani said. ""It's a pleasure for me to be by your side. It's always so special. We are sharing these moments that are unforgettable, so I'm really happy to share them with you."" 

Errani and Vavassori had the most experience together and that showed at Flushing Meadows. The close friends, who were supported by countrywoman Jasmine Paolini inside Arthur Ashe Stadium, displayed great chemistry and unrelenting net presence to stymie the singles stars in the draw and lift the trophy.




“It was an amazing atmosphere, so I have to say thanks to the organisation, to [tournament director] Stacey [Allaster], to Eric [Butorac] also for giving us the opportunity to play,"" Vavassori said. ""I have to say that we showed today that doubles is a great product…

“I think it was amazing to play on this court with so many people and I have to say thanks from the bottom of my heart for the atmosphere.”

It was far from easy in the championship match against Ruud and Swiatek, who won the Cincinnati Open singles trophy Monday evening. The singles stars thrilled the crowd with their shotmaking ability and showed great competitive spirit to push the Italians to the brink.



Vavassori, who dominated on his serve throughout the tournament, was broken when serving for the tournament at 6-3, 5-4. Ruud and Swiatek both raised their level and Errani and Vavassori were unable to meet the surge.

But while the singles standouts seized the momentum, the defending champions refused to go away. Showing a lot of energy after the set break by sprinting to one another after points, Errani and Vavassori took a 4/0 lead and held on from there. Errani nearly ended the tournament with an underhand serve, but Vavassori eventually clinched the event with a dipping passing shot that Swiatek was unable to handle.

“There are a lot of proud doubles specialists out there watching right now, loving every moment of it,” ATP No. 1 Club member John McEnroe said. “Good for them!” 

”I think this one is also for all the doubles players that couldn't play this tournament,"" Errani said. ""I think this one is also for them.”

Errani and Vavassori earlier eliminated Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison 4-2, 4-2 in the semi-finals. In the only match that went to a deciding set before the final , Ruud and Swiatek rallied past top seeds Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula 3-5, 5-3, 10-8.

“Congrats to Sara and Andrea, fully deserved. You proved that I guess mixed doubles players are smarter tactically than singles players, but we pushed 'til the end,"" Swiatek said. ""We tried to make it competitive and it was a pleasure to share the court with you and hopefully you're going to enjoy this and good luck with your doubles.""

“I would also like to congratulate Sara and Andrea. You deserve it,"" Ruud said. ""I guess there was some pressure on you guys when you came in being somewhat of the favourites and you delivered. You played amazing, so you fully deserve it, enjoy it and also good luck for doubles.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Tested but unbroken, Korda rallies into Winston-Salem QFs","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/winston-salem-2025-wednesday-report","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 02:58:38 GMT","

Sebastian Korda is finding form in his first tournament since Roland Garros. The American, who was battling a right shin stress fracture this summer, has won two matches at the Winston-Salem Open to reach the quarter-finals.

Despite dropping the opening set Wednesday, the 11th seed Korda was unbroken en route to a 6-7(3), 6-3, 6-4 victory against Poland's Kamil Majchrzak.

“It was a rollercoaster today, I was just waiting my turn,"" said the 25-year-old Korda, No. 86 in the PIF ATP Rankings. ""He was playing some great tennis, so I was just waiting to see if his level dipped a little bit. Luckily, I played a solid second game in the second set and started playing a lot better.”



The American won 82 per cent of his first-serve points and saved all six break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Korda will next meet 13th seed Miomir Kecmanovic, whom he is tied with at 1-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Korda beat the Serbian in this year's Adelaide semi-finals. Kecmanovic ousted third seed Luciano Darderi 6-3, 6-1 in 58 minutes to advance while Kecmanovic's countryman Hamad Medjedovic beat fourth seed Gabriel Diallo 6-4, 6-2.

Darderi and Diallo's losses mean that none of the top-four seeds remain at the ATP 250, where top seed Stefanos Tsitsipas and second seed Tallon Griekspoor were upset on Tuesday.

Buyunchaokete became the first Chinese player to reach the Winston-Salem last eight in tournament history when he defeated Mariano Navone 6-4, 6-4, backing up his Tuesday upset against top seed Stefanos Tsitsipas.



Ninth seed Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard won the all-French battle against Alexandre Muller 6-3, 6-2 and Hungarian Marton Fucsovics downed 2017 champion Roberto Bautista Agut 6-4, 6-3.


Botic van de Zandschulp was bagelled in the opening set against Sebastian Baez, but the Dutchman recovered to close the day with a 0-6, 6-1, 6-4 victory against the 2023 champion.

All of tennis' Hall of Famers share common ground when it comes to quantitative achievements. Certainly, some more than others, but each of these greats has generated an impressive series of results that have earned them enshrinement in Newport.Where they differ is on the qualitative front. What is the major attribute that best defines a legend's legacy? For Chris Evert and Stefanie Graf, it was steely-eyed concentration. For Martina Navratilova and Rod Laver, it was a wide array of tennis tools. For Jimmy Connors and Monica Seles, it was competitive intensity.Then there are two 2025 International Tennis Hall of Fame inductees, Bob and Mike Bryan. While watching these twin brothers play their extraordinary brand of doubles, you come away dazzled by the unsurpassed choreography of their movements across the court. As the joke went, you could be playing with someone your whole life and you'd still have been partners nine months less than Mike and Bob.“Even the very best doubles team in the world can never be as close as twin brothers in terms of understanding each other,” says Tom Gullikson, himself part of a doubles team of twins alongside his brother Tim.“Brothers are one thing,” says Luke Jensen, who won Roland Garros in 1993 alongside his younger brother, Murphy. “But twins? That's amazing.”

Bill Rapp, tournament director at the ATP tournament that was played in the San Francisco Bay Area until 2013, gave their brothers one of their first professional wild cards around the time they were leading Stanford to a pair of NCAA titles.Says Rapp: “A good way to describe the way they played was elegant.”Choreography. Understanding. Elegance. Based on these words, there was a musical quality to the way Bob and Mike moved around the court. This makes sense, as next to tennis, music was their biggest passion. Growing up, there was no TV in the Bryan family household. When they weren't practicing tennis or studying, Bob and Mike were deeply devoted to music.

“There's something cool to music that when you're playing it you can get to these flow states. It's a different vibe from the physicality of tennis.” Mike Bryan

“Mike is a great lead guitarist and a great drummer,” says their father, Wayne. “And Bob is a great keyboard player and bass player.”Wayne also had a deep engagement with music. He'd grown up in the Southern California town of Hawthorne, the same Los Angeles suburb the iconic band, the Beach Boys, had also lived in. Taking in those smooth mid-1960s songs, Wayne passed that passion on to his sons.Addressing the music-tennis connection 10 years ago during an interview with CNN, Wayne said: “Don't wait until you're eight, nine, 10—the minute you can walk or hold yourself upright, get on that keyboard, get on those drums, get on that guitar, start hitting tennis balls.”👉 Read More: The Bryan brothers' path to the Hall of Fame began at Roland Garros

The late Vitas Gerulaitis and John McEnroe also greatly enjoyed playing guitar and having the chance to engage with such musical icons as Carlos Santana and Keith Richards.

In 2008, while playing Rapp's tournament in San Jose, the Bryans met Jim Bogios, drummer with the band Counting Crows. An enthusiastic tennis player, Bogios has enjoying playing both tennis and music with Bob and Mike.“We hit it off right away,” says Bogios. “Tennis and music, it's like summer camp, 24/7 ... Playing music with them, you can see how much they love it. You can feel it. It's fun to be around that kind of love.”A year after meeting Bogios, the Bryans Brothers Band released an album. It was called Let it Rip. Besides the title track, other songs were titled “Marching On,” “Spending My Days,” and “Chasing the Sun.” Bogios subsequently performed on “Open My Heart,” a single the brothers trotted out in 2010.That musical dimension likely aided their tennis.“They have unbelievable rhythm in their play,” says Wayne. “And if you study them closely, they have unbelievable rhythm between the points ... in how they move, and even when they sit on the bench. I'm a massive believer in what you do in between points is as important as the actual shots.”

Over the years, the Bryan Brothers Band has performed at tournaments, charity events and private parties.“I feel like every athlete needs a hobby so they're not thinking about tomorrow's match too much,” says Bob. “[Playing music] was just a very fun way for us to get our mind off tennis, a relaxing hobby where you could be in the air conditioning and recharge your batteries ... Mike and I definitely have this ability with all the hours we've jammed together to get in this flow, in this pocket together.”Be it in music or tennis, these two brothers have unquestionably struck all the right chords.

A-list athletes from Patrick Mahomes and Serena Williams choose these reps to drive their lucrative off-the-field maneuvers.


							By 

	Daniel Kaplan



	Compared to only five years ago, managing an athlete's career has become a whole new game. Putting together THR's inaugural sports agent and manager list, of course, involved some consideration of the value of rich player contracts. But these days, a diverse off-the-field portfolio laden with streaming, movie and brand deals, not to mention production studios — the new “It” line item for those following in the footsteps of LeBron James and Steph Curry — are the new goalposts, with podcasts continuing to be a hot ticket (just ask Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift). As SMAC co-founder Constance Schwartz-Morini explains of clients' top demand: “Now all the athletes want is to have production companies.” 


	Bergman says he “kind of wrote the manual” when it comes to launching athletes on media platforms, having landed Dan Patrick roles in Adam Sandler movies since the early 2000s, most recently Netflix's Happy Gilmore 2. Case in point: Jesse Palmer found greater fame as both as an ESPN analyst and The Bachelor host than as a journeyman NFL quarterback. As for Pierson, he reps an array of MMA fighters in their crossover careers. With the UFC, he says “personalities are able to translate their characters as well as athleticism to the entertainment world.”

BERGMAN “The explosion of private equity investment in sports ownership. Sophisticated capital is now treating franchises like global assets, not just local teams, with a focus on media rights, technology, real estate and long-term brand value. We're just seeing the start of the evolution.”  


	Octagon's Olympic business has long steered its athletes to branch out, as exposure can be in short supply for Games that happen only once every four years. Miller, executive vp of Olympics, oversees the business of client Simone Biles, who is featured in the Emmy-nominated Simone Biles Rising. Carlisle, managing director of Olympics and action sports, boasts such clients as Michael Phelps and Aly Raisman, whose documentary Aly Raisman: Darkness to Light appeared on Lifetime. In Saratsis' basketball division, Giannis Antetokounmpo has his own production studio, which produced a series about the “Greek Freak” on Amazon. “Giannis alone is a Fortune 500 company,” says Saratsis. “In the past five to 10 years, the whole athletic entertainment spectrum has exploded.”

	Carter and client-partner LeBron James were way ahead of the curve on the athlete-starting-production-studio trend, creating SpringHill five years ago from a handful of existing businesses. The production house is a power in the sports movie and TV space, with such credits as Netflix's Hustle and The Playbook and Warners' Space Jam: A New Legacy. In 2021, Carter and James sold a minority stake that valued the company at $725 million, and last year SpringHill merged with Ben Winston and James Corden's Fulwell 73, which produces the Grammys and Hulu's The Kardashians.


	Colas, executive vp talent representation, was a driving force behind the movement to return client Brittney Griner home from incarceration in Russia and is the executive producer on the WNBA star's upcoming documentary on ESPN. She also is spearheading former WNBA great Diana Taurasi's doc on Amazon. Meanwhile, Montag, who is president of his own Wasserman offshoot, The Montag Group, continues to do what he has done for more than four decades, representing top broadcast talent like NBC's Mike Tirico and CBS' Jim Nantz. He sees more former players wanting to get in front of the camera: “Most athletes, post-career, are now assuming or wanting to get into media and broadcasting. I don't think that existed years ago.”

COLAS “Alex Morgan has built a brand that resonates as a champion, mother, advocate and entrepreneur. With winning and authenticity as her foundation, she's expanded opportunity for all women athletes.”

	Dahl and her agency guide athletes in creating their off-the-field brands, none more so than her star client, Patrick Mahomes; she was a producer on the Netflix season of Quarterback that featured the Kansas City Chiefs standout. Other clients include former New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman and former U.S. women's national soccer star Alex Morgan. She also reps Mahomes' wife, Brittany, an NWSL investor who has appeared in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. “Social media has allowed athletes to be in control of building their own brand outside of their field of play,” Dahl says. “Athletes have the ability to be the brand and the media company.”


Biggest shift in sports “The rise of women's sports! From record-breaking attendance at games, well-deserved increase in media coverage and a surge of brand deals, it has been so exciting to watch and be a part of.” 


	Duguid started his agency Evolve with Naomi Osaka as a platform for the four-time Grand Slam champion. The agency, which represents other tennis players including Nick Kyrgios, also recently signed world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, whose 1-month-old, behind-the-scenes video blog is already closing in on 1 million views. “Tennis, right now, is having a really important moment in culture, especially where tennis meets fashion and lifestyle,” says Duguid. Evolve also launched the production company Hana Kuma in partnership with SpringHill and James.

	3Arts Sports co-head Eanes and his brother André Eanes co-founded A&A Management in 2012 with the idea that athletes needed help shaping their brands. One of their first clients was a low-profile tight end named Travis Kelce. Aaron, who drives the deals while André heads up finance, helped develop Travis and Jason Kelce's smash podcast, New Heights, which recently enjoyed a huge spike in listeners with the latest episode featuring Travis' girlfriend, Taylor Swift; he also reps the Chiefs star for all matters off the field. A&A recently became part of the Lionsgate-controlled 3 Arts Entertainment, which Aaron touts for bringing “together the storytelling element, the producing element and the deep experience in Hollywood, with our experience with athletes and talent that's adjacent to sports.”


Biggest shift in sports “Name, Image and Likeness [or NIL, the right of student players, not the colleges they play for, to monetize their attributes] and the creativity and ingenuity it sparked in young athletes, because they've been given this opportunity to own their brand.”


	Range Media created its sports division nearly three years ago with an eye toward not so much player contracts — though it negotiates many, with 40 NFL clients including quarterback Brock Purdy — but off-the-field content. Armed with its own studio, Range Sports, overseen by co-presidents Funk and Luckman, it has quickly spun out new projects and is wrapping production on a docuseries that follows U.S. rugby Olympian Ilona Maher. “We talk about talent-to-content-to-commerce as the new paradigm,” says head of athlete marketing Taub. Range is working with Peyton Manning's Omaha Productions to produce The Undercovers, following the success of Eli Manning trying out for Penn State's football team disguised as “Chad Powers” (that's now the premise of a new Hulu series starring Glen Powell, see page 32). “So the pilot episode was Baker Mayfield going undercover with Bucs fans,” says Taub. “I don't want to reveal who, but [the series will] star different pro athletes.”

TAUB “Caddyshack.” 


	Gersh broke into sports last year with the acquisition of Madrid-based sports and entertainment agency You First, bringing his family's eponymous agency into the booming sector. “You look at players now in the same way as actors and musicians; they are brands in and of themselves,” says managing partner Steve Gersh. “Athletes have really started to embrace that, whether that's original content that they're getting involved in, like podcasts, producing unscripted projects, films, television and fashion.” Client media deals include soccer player Cristo Fernández in Ted Lasso; former NFL linebacker Spencer Paysinger as the creator, writer and producer of The CW series All American; and former NFL player Akbar Gbajabiamila's roles on The Talk, American Ninja Warrior and Good Morning Football.


Biggest shift in sports “The impact fashion is having. There is exciting interplay here, and we are focused on supporting our clients' individual styles, and helping to amplify them.”


	It's salad days for athletes getting content deals, and that means CAA Sports is inking scores of new production partnerships for clients, whether it's Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen's alliance with Skydance (now Paramount-Skydance) or a new docuseries on former Alabama coach Nick Saban. “There are bigger businesses to be built around these athletes, teams and leagues,” says Raphael, the agent who sold the docuseries The Comeback: 2004 Boston Red Sox to Netflix on behalf of Meadowlark Media and Major League Baseball. Kramer and Young, co-heads of sports media, rep ESPN's Joe Buck, Mike Greenberg and dozens of others, with the latter saying that on-air talent can make more — in some cases far more — than the players on the field. “Tony Romo, Joe Buck, Troy Aikman and Tom Brady will all make more in the booth than most active NFL players this year,” he says. Nonfiction TV agent Gross reps sports doc producers, including Box to Box, EverWonder, Barnicle Brothers and Meadowlark Media, as well as league production entities like NASCAR Studios. 


Biggest shift in sports


GROSS “Documentary series and films have turned athletes into cultural icons, influencing fan behavior. Fans today crave more than game highlights — they want depth, story arcs and emotional resonance. Platforms like Netflix, Amazon and Apple invest in binge-worthy series; as a result, sports documentaries are sometimes even more compelling than the game itself.”

KRAMER “Bryson DeChambeau did a public reinvention from being viewed as a divisive player on the LIV Golf tour to now clearly being a fan favorite. He did that by creating relatable viral content, from doing a daily challenge on TikTok and Instagram where he hit a golf ball over his house into a hole in his backyard, to creating his own digital show, Breaking 50, where he tries to break 50 on YouTube with a celebrity.” 


	UTA's sports media group had a big win this summer, advising Barstool Sports and its founder Dave Portnoy on the deal to integrate his brash site's content into Fox Sports, including on the Big Noon Kickoff. The agency expects more of these types of deals between digital upstarts and media graybeards: “In the new media landscape, there's now more crossover than ever between creators and the sports world,” says Hayden. UTA's business of repping sports broadcast talent has benefited tremendously from the proliferation of new streaming options, from Amazon Prime to Netflix. Gone are the days when the only jobs were at ESPN and broadcast networks. “Competition is great,” says co-head of sports media Silbowitz.

	The agency represents some of the greatest athlete content creators around, from Serena Williams to Tom Brady. Senior partner Smoller oversees Team Serena, including the 24-time Grand Slam winner's ventures into streaming and film (e.g., Oscar nominee King Richard). WME also reps Coco Gauff in conjunction with her newly formed agency. Hodes, also a senior partner, steers Brady's multifaceted media efforts outside of his Fox analyst deal, from Paramount's 80 for Brady feature to Netflix's The Roast. “The explosion of athlete-led media, brand ownership and content control is the macro shift,” affirms Hodes of the biggest change over the past five years in sports. Pyatt will be exiting the WME court this year reportedly to join WIN Sports, but in his time there, he's advised icons ranging from Peyton Manning to Lionel Messi on their media efforts. Head of sports content White's clients include Shaquille O'Neal and his media arm, Jersey Legends; ​​Derek Jeter's CAP 2 Productions; and NBA star Anthony Edwards' Three Fifths Media, among many other outfits.

HODES “Happy Gilmore has become a favorite because my son loves it. Watching it together, he laughs at the same lines I laughed at 30 years ago. Sports isn't just a business, it's something we bond over, argue about and share from one generation to the next.”

WHITE “I'm a true believer and fan of what Jesse Cole, the visionary behind The Savannah Bananas, and the team are doing. They're selling out massive stadiums on consecutive nights. Sports is entertainment, and all teams and leagues need to focus on how to better engage fans, especially considering the increasing expense of attending a game or watching it at home.” 


	In 2015, Sanders founded the sports marketing firm that offers brand-building services to athletes, from PR to endorsements to fashion. But like others in this space, he's been expanding into helping his clients, who include NFL wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins and retired NBA star Nick Young, launch production companies and podcasts, the must-have accessories for today's professional athlete. Another client, retired NFL great Chad Ochocinco, is starting up efforts in both categories with an emphasis on his other sports passion: soccer. “Ochocinco really wants Americans to understand and feel what it means to be a part of that soccer culture,” Sanders says of his client's vision for the recently minted Ochocinco Productions and yet-to-launch podcast.

His ventures into consumer packaged goods, media, tech, philanthropy and even his passion for golf show just how intentional and well-rounded his brand has become.”


	“This is the best time to be on my side of the business,” head of media talent Santry says, a refrain echoed among his peers at other firms representing sports broadcast talent. The entrance of streamers into the ecosystem has not only opened up more jobs, it's also driven up pay as platforms seek difference-making announcers. Formerly the head of talent at DAZN Group, Santry joined Excel last year, where he works with such clients as Anthony Rizzo and Turner Sports host Lauren Jbara and finalizes contracts for golf analysts Paul McGinley, Notah Begay and Colt Knost.

	Schwartz-Morini co-founded SMAC 15 years ago with Michael Strahan to focus on the budding business of athlete content and branding deals. Even she is surprised at just how much the sector has grown. “In the '90s and early 2000s, every player either wanted to be a rapper or have a record label, and now all the athletes want is to have production companies, or to think that they're producers,” she says. Her clients include Deion Sanders, two-way NFL rookie Travis Hunter and Erin Andrews. Diaz has worked as a producer for Deion's Double Play (ESPN), Coach Prime (Prime Video) and American Football (Audible).  Despite the crossover trend, the primary piece of advice that Schwartz-Morini gives to clients is to focus on their sport first: “It almost makes us cringe when we see an athlete who's injured and out on the IRL, and instead of posting their rehab or working to get back on the field, they're posting about their fashion lines.”

	Stahlberger is not sure, but he believes his client of 30 years, Fox NFL broadcaster Terry Bradshaw, may have been the very first crossover athlete. The Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback had a notable country music showing with his cover of Hank Williams' “I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry” hitting the Billboard Hot 100 in 1976. “You hear about the term ‘multihyphenate,' and sports clients seem to be more pervasive in that space than ever,” says Stahlberger, who this year took his off-field marketing expertise from WME to its football agency spinoff WIN Sports Group. Other multihyphenate clients include Christian McCaffrey, Justin Jefferson and Wayne Gretzky.

	After rising to partner, the talent agent left WME to form Envisionary last year. So while he recently spearheaded the groundbreaking ESPN contract for client Stephen A. Smith that pays the voluble commentator a reported $20 million annually, Rosen's old employer had a finger in the negotiation, too. That's appropriate, in a way, as Rosen is big on his clients, who include a range of talent from Alex Rodriguez to Bobby Flay, being able to work for multiple outlets. For example, Smith contractually has the right to be nonexclusive across the board, which pertains to his popular podcast and future political commentary alike.

	Capitalism is alive and well among athletes. Says Raskin, “We're seeing more entrepreneurial spirit among our clients,” which include former Carolina Panther and current Fox NFL analyst Greg Olsen, who is launching a youth sports content site this month, and San Francisco 49er George Kittle, who is starting a podcast production studio in September. Kittle, along with Olsen and Travis Kelce, launched Tight End University, which started as an offseason three-day program for tight ends on everything from injury rehab to film study. This year, it became big enough that ESPN reported live from the event in June.

	Klutch Sports represents megastar LeBron James, arguably the leading example of an athlete crossing over into entertainment production with his SpringHill Co. But he's not alone among Klutch's clientele. Co-founder and CEO Paul points to Anthony Davis. “Something I'm extremely excited about is … [his] production of Foul Play,” says Paul of the Dallas Maverick's prank show on TBS. English, who heads up the women's basketball side, reps collegiate star JuJu Watkins, who already has executive produced her own docuseries on Peacock. Unlike others on THR's list, Paul actually has some reservations about the crossover trend: “I push back on it somewhat, because if you're not great at something, then sometimes it can be very challenging trying to experiment within that. But if you want to be a part of something, then great, find a great team and be a part of that team. So I think there are a number of ways to exist within the ecosystem, outside of what you were actually born to do.” In 2019, UTA invested in Klutch, which retains its separate branding while the two firms have access to each other's resources.

	Paradigm's The Sports Group — a relatively new division of the agency, which like many in Hollywood has recently gotten into the space— represents some of the top names in combat sports, like Mike Tyson, who famously returned to the ring last year to battle against Jake Paul on Netflix. They're also working with the veteran boxer on a three-part documentary coming out on the streamer. “The way sports is so directly entangled with the prominent film and television companies that we work with on a day-in and day-out basis” has managing partner Ruf “blown away,” he says. Adds The Sports Group head LoPiccolo, “Athletes, they're like movie stars, like Will Smith, Matt Damon and Tom Cruise of the previous generation.” The agency also represents cultural phenomenon The Savannah Bananas, the traveling baseball circus, as well as WWE stars including CM Punk, Drew McIntyre and Liv Morgan.

RUF “The reliance of advanced analytics that has affected every decision, from scouting and drafting to contract structuring.” LoPiccolo: “Four-quadrant storytelling now belongs to the athletes, and Netflix is the new kingmaker.

	Athletes who once wanted an outsized media profile had largely two options: getting on linear TV and, to a lesser extent, radio. Now, podcasts and social media offer alternatives, and the role of Silver Tribe Media is to manage those efforts. Launched by Klein in 2021, Silver Tribe reps athlete-led podcasts like Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s network Dirty Mo Media and Bussin' With the Boys, whose substantial monthly listenership of millions led to an eight-figure licensing deal with FanDuel. “Podcasts are easy to start but difficult to grow, and there are often bumps along the way,” Klein says. “We team up with personalities and bring the production expertise and business operations needed to build, monetize and grow podcasts, YouTube channels, newsletters and social platforms.”

As Durant's business partner and manager, Kleiman and the NBA star have invested in sports teams in MLS, NWSL, pickleball and esports, and expanded the production and digital reach of Boardroom to include movies and other shows. “You see how much the intersection of sports, entertainment and culture exists ­— that's an opportunity for athletes and their entire ecosystem,” Kleiman says.

Movies and TV series will be suggested based on the zodiac in the company's latest move to give their homepage a playful edge on rivals.

Writer-at-Large


Netflix is wondering: Hey, what's your sign?


	The streamer isn't flirting (not yet, at least) but is launching a new hub within its platform devoted to astrology.




	The new “Your Zodiac Watchlist” feature will launch on subscriber homepages on Saturday (“When Virgo season officially kicks off,” noted a spokesperson), and will recommend movies and shows based on each astrological sign. The collection will be updated throughout the year to keep pace with the zodiac calendar.

	“At Netflix, our team of curators on the member experience team create these themed collections to help members discover something fresh, fun and timely,” the streamer said in a statement.

	











	For instance, Scorpios are assumed to be “passionate, charismatic, seductive and mysterious” and will be pitched mysteries like Wednesday and The Night Agent. Geminis are thought to be “social, playful and funny” and will be pitched stand-up specials and shows with “talkative characters.” Leos are considered “confident, generous and loyal” and will be pitched content about royalty and leaders like The Crown and Bridgerton. 


	Some of the sign characteristics are less flattering than others. Aquarius, for instance, are considered “oddballs, quirky, outsiders” and are pitched content about aliens, sci-fi and space — such as Rebel Moon (so they're assumed to be weird and with poor taste). 

	











	In case you're wondering, no, Netflix doesn't know what your birthday is, and, no, you don't need to tell the streamer your star sign in order to use the hub. Every subscriber can see the suggestions for all the signs. 


	Astrology has seemingly been making a popularity comeback of late, with Gen Z reportedly getting into horoscopes amid a surge of TikTokers and apps professing to read the stars. 


	Netflix has been getting more clever and topical with its hubs lately (as have other streamers), recently launching collections like “Hope They Don't End Up on the Kiss Cam” filled with steamy dramas in the wake of the Coldplay concert incident, and “Can I Pull You for a Chat?” inspired by the summer's Love Island craze (even though the show is on rival Peacock). You can preview the Astrology hub here.

Chad Stahelski is directing the action fantasy for Amazon MGM. 


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


Karen Gillan has joined the sword-swinging cast of Highlander, Amazon MGM's remake of the 1980s cult classic.


	Henry Cavill is leading the cast that includes Russell Crowe, Dave Bautista, and Marisa Abela.




	The action fantasy, which hails from Amazon MGM's United Artists banner, is being directed by Chad Stahelski and is slated for a theatrical release. Principal photography is due to begin at the end of September.


	The original Highlander, released in 1986, starred Christopher Lambert as Connor MacLeod, a Medieval Scottish Highlander who discovers he is an immortal warrior. With the help of a swordsman named Ramirez, played by Sean Connery, the titular Highlander battles other immortals across the centuries, culminating in a modern battle in which, like the classic line of dialogue goes, “there can be only one.”

	In the remake, Cavill is playing MacLeod while Crowe is Ramirez. Bautista is the savage warrior named The Kurgen while Industry actress Marisa Abela also has a leading role.


	Gillan will play Heather, MacLeod's mortal wife and the love of his life. 


	Michael Finch wrote the script for the remake. Scott Stuber and Nick Nesbitt are producing via United Artists, alongside Neal H. Moritz, Stahelski's 87Eleven Entertainment, Josh Davis of Davis Panzer Productions and Louise Rosner.

	











	If successful, Gillan may have a third franchise on her resume. The actress is best known for playing cybernetic alien Nebula in Marvel Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers series. And she also starred in Sony's Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle and Jumanji: The Next Level with a third on the way.


	She can now be seen in Neon's The Life of Chuck, based on the novella by Stephen King. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, where it was honored with the People's Choice Award.


	Gillan is repped by UTA, Maison Two, Linden Entertainment and Jackoway Austen.

The new variant follows on the heels of the ""Shiny Bug"" version of the album.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	Another countdown, another Taylor Swift vinyl variant — that's just the life of a showgirl. 


	On Thursday (Aug. 21), a shimmery blue countdown on the pop star's website ticked down to a 2 p.m. ET unveiling of a second alternate vinyl version of The Life of a Showgirl LP, Swift's 12th studio album thats set to arrive on Oct. 3. Packaged with exclusive photos and poetry penned by the 14-time Grammy winner, the new “Baby, That's Show Business” edition comes in two disc colors — lovely bouquet orange and lakeside beach blue — and features Swift in a yellow feather headdress and bedazzled lingerie, performing on a stage with a pack of other showgirls, on the cover.


	Fans should also take note that they have just two days to get their hands on the new variant, with a disclaimer on Swift's website emphasizing that it's only available — while supplies last — for the next 48 hours.

	











	The announcement comes just a couple of days after Swift dropped the first vinyl Showgirl variant, which was also available for just two days after a purple countdown heralded its arrival hours prior. Titled the “Shiny Bug Edition,” its exclusive cover featured the musician leaning against a wall, wearing a spiky, sparkly leotard and staring at the camera.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Clearly, countdowns are already becoming a quintessential part of the Life of a Showgirl rollout. The first one went live with an orange background on Swift's site the day prior to the album announcement; in the final hours before the performer announced via a New Heights podcast teaser clip that her 12th LP was imminent, the timer changed to display a series of doors that matched some of the visuals on Swift's global Eras Tour.


	Also on New Heights — the full episode featuring Swift arrived Aug. 13 — the songwriter shared more details about Showgirl, including its main cover art and tracklist. Featuring production fro Max Martin and Shellback and a collaboration with Sabrina Carpenter on the title track, the full-length is full of back-to-back “bangers,” according to Swift.


	“[The album is] a lot more upbeat, and it's a lot more fun pop excitement,” she said on the podcast. “My main goals were melodies that were so infectious, you're almost angry at it.”

Carey, who famously doesn't believe in the construct of age, will be the oldest recipient of the award to date.


													By
												

	Paul Grein



Mariah Carey will receive the Video Vanguard Award and perform a career-spanning hits medley at the 2025 MTV VMAs. The show is set to air live coast-to-coast on Sunday, Sept. 7, at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT on CBS, simulcast on MTV and stream on Paramount+ in the U.S.


	Carey, who famously doesn't believe in the construct of age – but who is 56 for those of us who do – will become the oldest recipient of the award to date, surpassing Richard Lester, director of The Beatles‘ films A Hard Day's Night and Help!. Lester was 52 when he received the award on the inaugural VMAs in 1984. (In a way, it's more impressive that Carey is receiving the award 35 years into her career than if she had gotten it when she was in her first flush of stardom. It's a real achievement for Carey to have sustained her star power for so many years.)

	











	It should also be noted that the recipients of the Video Vanguard Award have been moving up in age in recent years. Jennifer Lopez, Missy Elliott and Shakira were all past 45 when they received the honor.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Carey will be the eighth consecutive recipient of the award who is a woman, following Rihanna (2016), Pink (2017), Lopez (2018), Elliott (2019), Nicki Minaj (2022), Shakira (2023) and Katy Perry (2024). (The award wasn't presented in the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021.)


	Carey will return to the VMAs stage for the first time in 20 years. In 2005, she performed two smash hits – “We Belong Together” and “Shake It Off” – in a segment that also featured Jadakiss and Jermaine Dupri.


	Carey presented the Vanguard Award to LL COOL J in 1997. Coincidentally, the rapper and actor is hosting this year's VMAs, which will air from UBS Arena in New York.


	Carey made her VMAs debut in 1991 with a performance of “Emotions.” In 1998, Carey and Whitney Houston opened the show in an iconic pop culture moment when the two “accidentally” wore the same dress. They then presented the first award of the night – best male video to Will Smith for “Just the Two of Us.”


	MTV's press release announcing the award refers to it as the Video Vanguard Award twice and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award once. Carey and Jackson were both signed to Sony Music labels throughout the 1990s.


	Carey has amassed 19 No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, from “Vision of Love” in June 1990 to “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” which logged its most recent appearance at No. 1 in January 2025. That's more No. 1 hits than any other solo artist and is just one shy of the all-time record held by The Beatles. Impressively, she co-wrote 18 of those songs.


	Carey was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2022. She has been nominated for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in each of the last two years, but has yet to receive that accolade. Such contemporaries as Houston, Janet Jackson and George Michael, who likewise weren't rock & roll in the traditional sense, have been admitted into the Hall,  so Carey is likely to make it too eventually. 

	











	Carey has had six No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200, from Mariah Carey in March 1991 to E=MC2 in May 2008. She has won five Grammys, including vocal performance honors in both pop and R&B.


	Carey's 16th studio album Here for It All is set for release on Sept. 26. It includes her single “Type Dangerous,” which is nominated for a VMA for best R&B this year. If she wins, it will (amazingly) be her first VMA won in competition.


	In his annual forecast of who might get this year's Video Vanguard award, Billboard's Andrew Unterberger pegged Carey as this year's third-likeliest recipient (behind his top pick Miley Cyrus and runner-up pick Ed Sheeran). Unterberger wasn't working from a finite list of nominees. Theoretically anyone could receive the honor, making it impressive that he came so close.


	Said Unterberger about Carey's chances: “Has Mariah Carey really never won the Video Vanguard award? Forget that: Mariah Carey has still never won a single Video Music Award, getting shut out to date in eight career nominations stretching back to 1996. She's up for a ninth in September, with ‘Type Dangerous' nominated for best R&B video, but MTV could really make this wrong right by giving Mimi the Video Vanguard for her decades-spanning career as a music video superstar. She'd be on the veteran side for the award at this point, but that didn't stop MTV from honoring Shakira two years ago, so perhaps there's still a chance for MC after all — and given the release of new album Here for It All later this September, now would be the time.”


Sabrina Carpenter is set to perform on the VMAs for the second year in a row. Alex Warren, Busta Rhymes, J Balvin featuring DJ Snake, Ricky Martin and sombr are also set to perform.

	











	Busta will receive the MTV VMA Rock the Bells Visionary Award, presented by host LL COOL J (who had a hit in 1986 titled “Rock the Bells”). Martin will be honored with the inaugural Latin Icon Award.


Lady Gaga leads the nominations for the 2025 MTV Video Music Awards with 12 nods, followed closely by her “Die With a Smile” duet partner Bruno Mars, who has 11 nods. Other top contenders are Kendrick Lamar (10), ROSÉ and Carpenter (eight each), Ariana Grande and The Weeknd (seven each) and Billie Eilish (six).


	This will mark the first time the show has been broadcast by CBS. It will also simulcast on MTV and stream on Paramount+ in the U.S.


	The 2025 MTV VMAs are executive produced by Bruce Gillmer, Den of Thieves co-founder Jesse Ignjatovic, and Barb Bialkowski. Gunpowder & Sky CEO Van Toffler is producer. Alicia Portugal is co-executive producer. Jackie Barba is executive in charge of production. Wendy Plaut is executive in charge of celebrity talent. Lisa Lauricella is executive in charge of music talent.


	This marks Toffler's return to the show following a decadelong absence.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Paramount+‘s Head of Originals Jane Wiseman has made her first move with a high-profile hire. She is bringing in Chris Parnell, most recently an Apple TV+ creative executive and previously co-president of Sony Pictures TV Studios, to her team at the streamer overseen by Cindy Holland, Paramount's Chair of Direct-to-Consumer.


	Parnell has been appointed as EVP for Paramount+ Originals, reporting to Wiseman, Deadline has learned. He will be responsible for the development and production of the platform's slate of original content.


	Ever since former Netflix Head of Comedy Wiseman was named Head of Originals for Paramount+ two weeks ago, upon the close of Skydance's acquisition of Paramount Global, there had been chatter that she may recruit a seasoned executive with drama background.

	Parnell fits that bill. He has extensive experience in drama — both at Sony TV, where he rose through the drama ranks to co-head of the department, and at Apple. He also has overseen comedy and will shepherd projects across both genres for Paramount+.




			Watch on Deadline		







	A well-liked executive, Parnell is known for his passion for everything comic book/genre/geek stuff-related, which he would apply to signature Paramount IP, including Paramount+'s Star Trek franchise, which the streamer's new leadership is looking to further expand.


	Parnell is joining Paramount+ from another streamer, Apple TV+, where he served as a senior creative executive of US Television under Matt Cherniss for the past five years. 


	There, he was involved in developing such scripted series as Dark Matter, Neuromancer, The Last Frontier, Bad Monkey and Vince Gilligan's upcoming Pluribus, reuniting with the Breaking Bad creator with whom he had worked at Sony TV. 


	Parnell also led the development of AppleTV+'s original content for the Apple Vision Pro launch, including the platform's first full immersive series Adventure and first full-length spatial film Bono: Stories Of Surrender (immersive).

	











	Before joining Apple TV+ in 2020, Parnell spent 16 years at Sony TV, including stints as co-head of U.S. drama development and programming and ultimately co-president of SPT Studios, guiding all creative aspects of the studio's domestic television business alongside fellow former co-president Jason Clodfelter.


	Over the years, Parnell helped develop such broadcast, cable, and streaming series as For All Mankind, Outlander, The Boys, The Blacklist, Better Call Saul, The Boys, Timeless, Preacher, Wheel of Time, Electric Dreams and Zombieland, which later became a feature for Columbia Pictures.

	Bleecker Street has taken U.S. rights to the Zachary Wigon directed Victorian Psycho, starring Maika Monroe, Jason Isaacs and Thomasin McKenzie, which Deadline first told you about at Cannes. 


	The pic is based on Virginia Feito's novel of the same name, the author adapting her tome. Bleecker Street plans to release the film nationwide theatrically in 2026, with cameras rolling this week in Ireland. Set in Victorian England, Victorian Psycho sees an eccentric governess arrive at a remote gothic manor, where strange happenings stir suspicion that she's not what she seems.Victorian Psycho is produced by Dan Kagan (Longlegs) under his Traffic banner as well as Sebastien Raybaud (Greenland: Migration) for Anton and Wigon, in association with Anonymous Content. EPs include Anonymous Content's Nick Shumaker and Bard Dorros, Feito, and Bleecker Street's Kent Sanderson and Miranda King. The deal was negotiated by King and UTA Independent Film Group, CAA Media Finance, and Anton on behalf of the filmmakers. Anton is fully financing the film and is representing international rights.  “We are proud to partner with this incredible creative team on Victorian Psycho. Zach's vision is thrilling, and we know every frame will be shocking, unique, and for lack of a better word, cutting” said Kent Sanderson, CEO at Bleecker Street. “Backing this film continues Bleecker's mandate of supporting exciting voices and bringing entertaining, impactful films from across all genres to theaters.”Bleecker Street recently picked up horror film Bone Lake, set to release October 3; Oscar-winner Guy Nattiv's Harmonia starring Bella Ramsey, Odessa Young, Carrie Coon and Lily James, which is in production; and The Third Parent starring Rob Lowe, Crispin Glover and Roselyn Sanchez, which is in post.

					By Katie Campione 

TV Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Production has officially begun on Season 4 of Sullivan's Crossing, and Deadline has an exclusive first look at what's happening on the Nova Scotia set.


	A photo of Morgan Kohan, Chad Michael Murray and Marcus Rosner teases a brewing love triangle between their characters after the Season 3 cliffhanger in which Rosner's Liam revealed himself as Maggie's (Kohan) husband. 


	Obviously, Cal (Murray) was not pleased to learn this information — but the snapshot from set seems to be hinting that, at least at first, Cal will still be a doting partner to Maggie as he's staring pretty lovingly at her. We get the sense Cal will definitely need to watch out for Liam, though, as he lingers behind Maggie staring at Cal with a furrowed brow.

	Deadline also has individual shots of Maggie and Cal as well as a shot of the film slate, which are embedded below. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	“I am beyond proud to be going back for Season 4 with such an amazing cast and crew,” Kohan said in a statement Thursday. ”It's been absolutely incredible to see the organic growth of our show throughout our first three seasons. We've had such a beautiful audience base in Canada and it's been so exciting to see that expand in such a huge way internationally. Season 4 truly feels like our best yet and I can't wait to share it with everyone!”


	Added Murray: “We're so happy returning to our Sullivan's family and these wonderful characters. There's always an excitement in being back on set and I'm proud of how far the show has come; not only here in Canada, but around the world. It's amazing to be part of something that resonates with people in such a meaningful way.”

	











Sullivan's Crossing recently struck gold on Netflix, raking in 22M hours watched to become the third most-watched series on the streamer in the week that it debuted. But, prior to its arrival on Netflix, the series had a first window in the U.S. on The CW, where it has also become a top three show on the network by both total audience and 18-49. 


	The series is not just a hit in the U.S., either. Airing on CTV and Crave in Canada, Season 3 was CTV's most-watched Canadian scripted series of the 2024-25 broadcast year, per Canadian media data company Numeris. Internal data provided to Deadline also says that, on Crave, Season 3 was a consistent Top 20 program and saw 20% audience growth over Season 2.


Sullivan's Crossing also marks yet another collaboration between author Robyn Carr, creator and showrunner Roma Roth, and executive producer Christopher E. Perry — the same team behind Netflix's hit Virgin River. 


	The five-book series follows neurosurgeon Maggie Sullivan (Kohan), who finds herself in legal trouble and returns to her hometown in rural Nova Scotia to reconnect with her estranged father (Scott Patterson), while figuring out her relationship with Cal (Murray). The series introduced Rosner's Liam at the end of Season 3 as Maggie's old summer fling who'd returned to seemingly stir up trouble. Ultimately, the season ends on a cliffhanger when he claims to be Maggie's husband.


	“I'm absolutely thrilled that Sullivan's Crossing is returning for a fourth season,” Roth said in a statement of her own. “Seeing it resonate with a global audience and watching the ratings climb have been a dream come true. Season 4 will explore themes of change and transformation so you can expect a whole new set of exciting and emotional challenges for Maggie and Cal.”


	Season 4 of Sullivan's Crossing is executive produced by Reel World Management and Muse Entertainment in association with Bell Media's CTV, The CW, and Fremantle. The series is distributed internationally by Fremantle.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Sumptuous Chinese mega-hit Ne Zha 2 ironically suffers from Hollywood-style bloat","https://www.avclub.com/ne-zha-2-review","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 19:02:40 GMT","

When Ne Zha 2 finally graces North American movie theaters this week with an English dub, most families who venture out to give it a try likely won't know that it's the most successful film of 2025. A sequel to 2019's Ne Zha, Chinese writer-director Jiao Zi's debut, Ne Zha 2 continues to adapt and remix aspects of the mythology-rich 16th-century Chinese novel The Investiture Of The Gods. The animation turns the text into a bold world overflowing with supernatural powers, convoluted history, and the big emotions that motivate Ne Zha, a little demon boy just trying to fit in. As venerable as the source material may be, Jiao Zi has crafted a timeless, relatable antihero and expands upon the original film both visually and conceptually—though his film will leave audiences emotionally underwhelmed.

Ne Zha 2 continues the story of fated enemies reincarnated as warriors known as the Demon Orb, Ne Zha (Crystal Lee), and the Spirit Pearl, Ao Bing (Aleks Le). In the final moments of the previous film, the two saved one another but their bodies were disintegrated. However, their spirits were protected by Ne Zha's master, Taiyi Zhenren (Rick Zieff), who uses a Sacred Lotus to regenerate their bodies so they can return to the mortal coil and help fight against a new attack on their home of Chentang Pass. This attack is happening because the Dragon King Of The East Sea (Christopher Swindle) didn't get the message that his son Ao Bing still exists, albeit in a more ephemeral form. Seeking vengeance, he commands Master Shen Gongbao (Daniel Riordan) to unleash demons and dragons upon the people of the Pass—which includes his son, whose new body falls apart under his extreme exertion in battle. 

A truce is then made: Ne Zha will share his body with the spirit of Bing for a week, where they'll complete three heavenly trials that will essentially allow them to power up the spent Sacred Lotus, rebuild Bing's body once more, and (eventually) achieve immortality. While Ne Zha 2 doesn't turn into an animated version of Steve Martin's All Of Me, the funny comes from feral demon Ne Zha hosting the more balanced spirit of Bing within him, which makes them an all-the-more formidable team. 

For all of the complexities and twists inherent to their quest (and boy, it gets dense), there's always a fart or barf joke waiting in the wings to bridge any cultural divides. Jiao Zi lets both rip frequently and passionately, which is the baseline for the base comedy, and the only real kiddie stuff in Ne Zha 2. Though the central trials include plenty of anthropomorphized critters, the film is mostly centered on serious subject matter. Gravitas is the point, with some atonal sidebars that get corny or break tension using buffonish characters. 

Admirably, the sequel doubles down on the curse of Ne Zha's origins. Despite his heroic deeds, he's still considered an outsider, and suffers as the butt of many jokes and gross scenarios. In that litany of embarrassing setups he's made to overcome, Jiao Zi re-frames the poor demon kid as vulnerable and resilient—anything but the enemy. While he's got the unconditional love of his demon-slaying parents, Lady Yin (Michelle Yeoh) and Li Jing (Vincent Rodriguez III), the rest of the universe sees him as evil. His journey is not only intended to solve the Bing body problem, but to let the world see him as his friend and parents do. 

Unfortunately, that emotional throughline gets obscured by an overpacked script with too many additional missions, threat reveals, and battles, battles, battles. By the time Ne Zha and Ao Bing master the trials and meet Immortal Wuliang (Will Utay) in his heavenly compound surrounded by omnipotent Demon Hunters, there's already been enough story and worldbuilding for two films, yet there's a lot more to go before its 144 minutes are through. Despite being a Chinese production, Ne Zha 2 suffers from the worst Hollywood trope: blockbuster bloat. The film continues far past the point where awe tips into exhaustion.

But that awe certainly does exist. The sheer scale that Jiao Zi and his animation co-directors Ge Yi and Hao Shan strive towards, is beyond anything Western CG animation has yet delivered. Every frame contains a kaleidoscope of details so mind-boggling at times in its depth and breadth that one wonders how long it took to create such density without blowing out a power grid. From the lava flows to the floating compounds, massive metal lotus flowers to cherry trees festooned with golden warriors, even the most mundane scenes contain something worthy of a double-take.

But with that indulgence comes a lack of restraint. When the film's focus finally does come back to Ne Zha, after ceaseless numbing battles, it's hard to get back into the emotional space to reconnect and feel moved by what happens to him. It's not hard to understand why global audiences turned out in droves to see Ne Zha 2. Its boundlessly creative visuals, rich character design, all-enveloping sound, and imaginative scenarios are truly original. But that sensory onslaught—those endless fights with their own progressive stakes—comes at the expense of focus, character, and story.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","R.I.P. Brent Hinds, Mastodon co-founder and singer-guitarist","https://www.avclub.com/brent-hinds-obituary-mastodon","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 18:29:30 GMT","

Brent Hinds, heavy metal singer, guitarist, and co-founder of Mastodon, was killed in a motorcycle crash in Atlanta Wednesday night. The musician's death was reported by local outlets such as Atlanta News First and confirmed by Mastodon in an Instagram tribute. “We are in a state of unfathomable sadness and grief… last night Brent Hinds passed away as a result of a tragic accident,” the band wrote. “We are heartbroken, shocked, and still trying to process the loss of this creative force with whom we've shared so many triumphs, milestones, and the creation of music that has touched the hearts of so many.” Hinds was 51.

Hinds was born in Alabama but relocated to Atlanta in the '90s, per Pitchfork. It was here that he met bassist Troy Sanders, whose band, Four Hour Fogger, he initially joined. When that band fell apart, the two linked up with drummer Brann Dailor and guitarist Bill Kelliher to form Mastodon in 2000. The band would go on to release eight studio albums including their critically acclaimed second record, Leviathan, a concept album based on Moby Dick that The A.V. Club once hailed as helping to “usher in a golden age of heavy metal.” The band has been lauded over the years for their inventive compositions and progressive sound. They've earned six Grammy nominations to date, with a Best Metal Performance win for “Sultan's Curse,” a single off their Grammy nominated album Emperor Of Sand, in 2018.

The band kept its original lineup until this past March, when the other three members posted on Instagram that they and Hinds had “mutually decided to part ways.” “We're deeply proud of and beyond grateful for the music and history we've shared and we wish him nothing but success and happiness in his future endeavors,” the band's post continued. Earlier this month, however, Hinds claimed that the group “kicked me out… for embarrassing them for being who I am,” along with a slew of harsh words for his former bandmates, per Billboard.

Hinds participated in a number of side projects throughout his career as well, including bands like Fiend Without A Face, West End Motel, Giraffe Tongue Orchestra, and Legend of the Seagullmen. He also made a handful of brief acting appearances, including in the movie Jonah Hex, for which Mastodon composed the soundtrack, an episode of Game Of Thrones, and a satirical ad for local Atlanta restaurant Elmyr. 

In a 2013 conversation with The A.V. Club that mostly centered on how much he hated Santana's “Smooth,” Hinds also reflected on meeting his heroes. “I don't like to talk to my idols,” he said. “When I meet kids and they're goo-goo for meeting me, I try to be as cool as I can, because I remember. I haven't won every battle of meeting strangers every day of my life, but I just think that any person that plays music for their profession and gets popular from it should really mind the fact that they have people that look up to them, and just try—no matter how bad of a mood you're in—to be cordial.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","VIDEO: Alfonso Ribeiro Shares DWTS Season 34 Announcement","https://entertainmentnow.com/dancing-with-the-stars/alfonso-ribeiro-season-34-announcement-update/","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 18:56:29 GMT","

A video posted by the official “Dancing with the Stars” Instagram account and tagging co-host and former Mirrorball Trophy winner Alfonso Ribeiro has given fans a sneak peek into what is to come in Season 34.

A post shared by Dancing With The Stars #DWTS (@dancingwiththestars)

As fans prepare for Season 34, which is set to premiere on September 16, there have been a few promotional videos released to generate excitement. This includes a clip on Instagram showing Ribeiro looking very stylish in a black suit, white shirt, and black bowtie, as he addresses he cameras. “Hey, everyone,” he says. “I just want to say how excited we are to have everyone back on Season 34. Our 20th year on ‘Dancing with the Stars.'”

He continues, “It's going to be fantastic. I can't wait for you guys to come take the ride with us this season.”

The caption on the post reads, “@therealalfonsoribeiro is ready for Season 34 of #DWTS! Watch the premiere Tuesday, September 16 on @abc and @disneyplus! Next day on @hulu.” However, the caption for the post offers no further clues. Is another big announcement coming? Do we know which professional dancers will be signing on for this season? How about celebrity contestants?

Fans have been waiting very patiently for the contestants to be announced, and so far, there are only four. Wildlife conservationist Robert Irwin (whose sister Bindi Irwin competed on and won Season 21 alongside Derek Hough), social media influencer Alix Earle, and “Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” stars Jen Affleck and Whitney Leavitt. Are these great stars? Absolutely! But fans are also ready for more!

Comments on the video include, “So excited!!! I've been looking forward to the show for a while now!!,” and “Soooo can't wait Let's Go!! Love Love DWTS!!”

Although it's always great to see anything with Ribeiro, DWTS fans are also calling for a new announcement about the upcoming season, given that it will premiere in less than a month. “WHERES THE ANNOUNCEMENT!!” a fan wrote, and their comment has been liked hundreds of times in agreement.

“​​Okay, can we get the “stars/pros” announcement? I'm happy they're back and hosting but we're ready THE announcement!” another fan wrote.

Professional dancer Emma Slater also appeared to poke fun at the video with a playful comment. She wrote, “Love this announcement,” followed by three crying with laughter emojis.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Stephanie Shojaee's Mysterious Posts Spark Rumors About RHOM Future","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/stephanie-shojaee-rhom-exit-rumors/","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:02:41 GMT","

Stephanie Shojaee has fans talking — and not in the way she probably hoped. After posting a string of cryptic Instagram Stories right after the “Real Housewives of Miami” season 7 reunion, viewers are now questioning if the 40-year-old real estate mogul is gearing up to leave the show before season 8 even begins.

A post shared by SHOMA GROUP real estate (@shomagroup)

The speculation comes amid Stephanie's ongoing feud with Alexia Nepola, 58, which has fueled plenty of drama this season. But according to fans online, her latest social media activity may hint at more than just shade.

On Reddit, fans began dissecting Stephanie's posts after screenshots made the rounds. In one clip, filmed on a boat with her hair blowing in the wind, Stephanie wrote: “‘Join Miami Housewives' they said… ‘you'll be fine'… they said.”

In another photo, originally shared by her company, Shoma Group, she captioned, “Shoma is where I belong.”

“Did Steph quit???” one fan asked. Others quickly jumped in, with some convinced that the messages meant Stephanie was walking away, while others suspected the posts were just part of a Bravo-worthy stunt.

“I doubt she would quit – she wants the business promotion and the deals she can get from the show,” one viewer reasoned. Another added, “I could see her ‘quit' before not getting asked back. If the reunion went bad she may be trying to save face.”

“Noooo I love to hate her she makes me laugh and drives Alexia insane,” joked another fan. 

A post shared by Stephanie Shojaee (@stephshojaee)

In an interview with Entertainment Tonight last month, Stephanie admitted that her first season wasn't all glitz and glamour. “I think it's been one of the hardest things I've ever done in my life. No joke,” she said, calling the experience “a rollercoaster” despite also being “so much fun.”

Weeks later, when asked directly on Instagram if she would appear in season 8, Stephanie dodged the question. “Let's concentrate on season [seven], and making sure it's the best season and most watched!” she wrote.

Stephanie joined the cast during season 7, but her connections to the group run deep. She previously dated Anthony Lopez, the longtime partner of RHOM alum Nicole Martin, nearly 20 years ago. While the history raised eyebrows, Stephanie insisted to Entertainment Weekly that it was no big deal. “It didn't last longer than like, a year or so, it's really not that big of a deal,” she explained.

Will Stephanie Shojaee join the infamous ranks of the one-and-done housewives? Let us know what you think in the comments below.

New episodes of the “Real Housewives of Miami” air Thursday nights on Bravo.

In the new “The Naked Gun” movie, Liam Neeson's Frank Drebin Jr. is obsessed with early aughts culture. He laments the Janet Jackson Super Bowl halftime show and being refused Freedom Fries. He's a superfan of the Black Eyed Peas and “Buffy, the Vampire Slayer.” And, when it comes to watching his precious episodes of “Buffy,” they are (well, at least, they were) all stored on his TiVo which was, crucially, not connected to the internet so the episodes wouldn't expire.

The early aughts was a strange, but also exciting time when it came to consuming media. There were no streaming services — even watching a movie trailer online, something we take entirely for granted today, could take hours to download if it was something popular like, say, the “Attack of the Clones” trailer. But the explosion of the DVD market was truly exciting.

Finally, films could be viewed in their proper aspect ratios without the need for bulky laserdisc players that required multiple discs and flipping those multiple discs while viewing. Finally, a whole world of bonus features and commentary tracks were available to the masses, presented in a quality that was, frankly, good enough for the cathode-ray televisions of the era that most people still had.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






I like to think that Frank Drebin Jr. has a whole closet filled with DVDs of “Dante's Peak” and “Six Days, Seven Nights.” But one that he almost definitely does not have is the Criterion DVD release of “Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom.”

The Criterion Collection, arguably the best-known boutique film distributer of home media, was (in partnership with Janus Films), a pioneer in the early days of LaserDiscs. Many of innovations that have already been referenced — proper aspect ratios and commentary tracks — were developed in the 1980s by Criterion.

Criterion entered the DVD market in 1998 with its release of “Seven Samurai.” (The “Grand Illusion” disc that Criterion intended to be its first release was delayed due to restoration work.) The Collection's DVDs, all individually numbered on the spine, became must-haves for cinephiles and home theater enthusiasts, no matter what the film in question happened to be. The 17th film in the Criterion Collection's DVD coffers would wind up being, let's say, “remarkable,” for a few reasons.

“Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom” was actually first released into the Criterion Collection in 1993, on LaserDisc. This is, obviously, a very controversial film and, thankfully, it is not my job to get into any of the themes of the film itself, which has been explored at length for your entertainment on this very website. (Though, for the sake of this piece, I did watch the film and I do have to question the morals of at least a few of the characters. A couple of the things that happen just may cross a line. I'm no lawyer, but some of the characters' actions might be considered “crimes.”)

 










Aleen Stein was a founder of The Criterion Collection and, until 2024, was still a shareholder in the company. And, yes, she remembers when “Salò” became an inductee into The Criterion Collection on LaserDisc. “Generally, my partners Bill Becker and Jonathan Turell pitched the films,” Stein told IndieWire. “I didn't have that much of an opinion if something belongs in The Criterion Collection or not. Sometimes I did.”

As it turns out, “Salò” was one of the films she had an opinion on. “I thought ‘Walkabout,' for example, should be in the collection, and they decided that I was right and put it in there. ‘Salò,' I thought, should not be in there because it was such a disgusting movie,” she said. “And they overruled me. ‘Ghostbusters,' for example, I thought was an iconic comedy and should really should be in there and they agreed with me.” (For those who did not know, yes, “Ghostbusters” was released as a Criterion LaserDisc in 1989.)

Stein explained her partners' reasoning: “They were also the owners of Janus Films and they tended to put anything that was in Janus into The Criterion Collection. That was probably the main criteria why ‘Salò' ended up getting into the collection.” And then things got really nuts.

 










Here's what happened: The Criterion DVD release of “Salò” was released in 1998 and then, suddenly, it was no longer available. For collectors who just had to have every Criterion spine number, missing #17 was kind of a big deal. Keep in mind, DVD players in 1998 would set a consumer back around $700. So, around the time DVD players became more affordable — and when most collectors would be starting to put a Criterion DVD collection together — it was near-impossible to get The Criterion Collection #17.

The secondary market on eBay exploded. For almost a decade, The Criterion Collection DVD of “Salò” wasn't just the Holy Grail of Criterion collectors, it became the Holy Grail of all DVD collectors. And even if collectors could find a disc on sale, eBay prices soared to around $300 a pop.

When I reached out to The Criterion Collection to get some basic information about why the DVD had gone out of print, I was told they would not be participating. I did speak to a number of people who had knowledge of the situation, however, and I was told it was mostly a rights issue — hardly the sort of mundane answer befitting such a wild film.

It's frustratingly difficult to find eBay sale history, especially for auctions that ended two decades ago, but I did find some old message board entries from the era discussing the pretty insane prices for “Salò,” a movie most people don't even enjoy watching. Gathering from these message boards and my own memory, the price of the disc usually hovered around $400. Though, in 2004 a user on a message board called “Steve Hoffman Music Forums” was distraught to see a disc for sale on eBay for $950. (Though it's unclear if this disc actually sold for that price.) 

 










Here are two from 2002 from people who just want to watch the film, but can't afford the eBay prices. One solution offered was to buy a Region 2 disc of the film, but, back then that also involved buying a Region 2 DVD player. (If you buy a 4K disc today, it will play on any player. Back then, there were region codes that made it very difficult to watch films that were not released by a U.S. distributor.) 

A user named Veli-Matti Reitti wrote, “Since the criterion version of this masterpiece is almost impossible to find anymore except through ebay where you'll be forced to pay ridiculous amounts for it if you somehow manage to land the winning bid. From what i've read and heard the transfer looks great and i wouldn't mind owning a copy of it but due to the price difference i'll probably have to buy my first R2 DVD.”

He's offered some advice on obtaining a region two DVD, but Paul_D can't figure out what all the fuss is about, “Could someone explain what all the fuss is about with this film? I've done multiple searches all over the place and I can't come up with a satisfying explanation as to why this is so controversial. I know it has risque content, but its reputation is unprecedented. Why?”

Why indeed.

Here's one from 2003 warning of the Criterion bootlegs of “Salò” that flooded the market, and notes on how to avoid buying one. A user named Seb seemed confused that the notoriously high-priced “Salò” is only $50 on eBay, and was worried he's not buying the real deal, followed by some very intense gratitude for any answers: “Is EVERYONE selling bootlegs? Or is it the bootleg-scare? What is going on, and WHERE can I find my LEGIT copy? THANK YOU VERY MUCH, Seb”

 










As a user named Jeff pointed out to Seb that, he was, indeed, looking at bootlegs. Jeff gave Seb some tips on how to spot the forgeries: “All the ones listed under “salo criterion” are bootlegs. While they look pretty close on the cover, a couple of dead giveaways are: Chapter stops: should be 29, not 6 or 9. Picture disc: the legit one HAS a white ring in the center, artwork does not go to the center of the disc.”

Here's one from 2006 warning owners to sell their copies now because Criterion would be selling the disc again, which eventually did happen. “Quick, eBay your Salo DVD now! Criterion re-release coming soon!,” warned PaulP, based on something he read on a blog that no longer exists. He added, “P.S.: You'll also note that there's a hint that Andrei Rublev and Shock Corridor may be coming as new re-releases soon too.”

Great news for PaulP, he's correct, those two titles are also available on Criterion's website. And you can purchase the Blu-ray directly from Criterion as you read this.

What's funny about the brand-new Blu-ray Criterion disc that you can buy right now for $31.96 (or less if you wait for a sale), is that this specific DVD of “Salò” from 1998 still goes for around $50 on eBay. 

My only hope, if we are all blessed enough to get another “Naked Gun” movie, is that Frank Drebin Jr. adds the secondary market cost of the Criterion DVD of “Salò” to his extensive list of 25-year-old pop culture grievances. It's a worthy one.

Fall is here, give or take another heat wave, and with it comes fall TV. As the television world gears up for the 77th Emmy Awards, next year's hopefuls are already debuting amid a stacked autumn schedule.

The season kicks off with “The Paper,” a highly anticipated “The Office” spinoff starring Domhnall Gleeson on Peacock. September brings “Task” from “Mare of Easttown” creator Brad Ingelsby, Olivia Cooke and Robin Wright-starrer “The Girlfriend,” a new FX vehicle from “Reservation Dogs” scribe Sterlin Harjo, and Mae Martin's latest eerie collaboration with Netflix — among many others.

October brings a new Anne Rice series to AMC, a new workplace comedy to CBS, a new season of “Nobody Wants This” to Netflix, and the horror series “It: Welcome to Derry” on HBO. In November, TV darlings Sarah Snook and Rhea Seehorn grace our screens once more, and “Stranger Things” begins a multi-part farewell that will continue through the end of the year.

And as the year winds down, don't forget to leave room for the titles with unannounced dates that have already caught our eye, including Netflix's “Boots,” “The Beast in Me,” and “Death by Lightning,” as well as Ryan Murphy's “All's Fair” on Hulu and Marvel's “Wonder Man” starring Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. Keep an eye out as always for our monthly new TV previews and all things Emmys ahead of September 14.

Here are 25 TV shows to check out this fall.

Ben Travers contributed to this list.

The team from “The Office” return to another eccentric workplace — literally; Greg Daniels' and Michael Koman's generously described spinoff series hinges on the documentary crew unveiled late in “The Office” picking up a new subject in a new city. This time their focus is a local Ohio newspaper, “The Toledo Truth Teller,” fighting against all odds to stay afloat under the leadership of new editor-in-chief Ned (Domhnall Gleeson).

With a dream in his heart and a story in his eye, Ned will lead his team of intrepid reporters (another generous description) to journalistic glory — or at least to another day of not having their budget slashed. Also starring Sabrina Impacciatore, Chelsea Frei, Melvin Gregg, Gbemisola Ikumelo, Alex Edelman, Ramona Young, Tim Key, and Oscar Nuñez. Daniels and Koman serve as co showrunners and executive produce with Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant, Howard Klein, Ben Silverman and Banijay Americas. —PK

Mark Ruffalo and Tom Pelphrey star in this series from “Mare of Easttown” creator Brad Ingelsby. As the suburbs of Philadelphia face a series of increasingly violent robberies, the FBI assembles a task force to track down those responsible. Unbeknownst to the agents, the criminal they're searching for leads a double life as a beloved husband and father, none of which will keep anyone safe as they get closer to the truth.

Ingelsby serves as showrunner and executive produces with directors Jeremiah Zagar and Salli Richardson-Whitfield. Executive producers Mark Roybal and Paul Lee for wiip; Mark Ruffalo; David Crockett; Ron Schmidt. Co-executive producers Nicole Jordan-Webber and Jeremy Yaches. —PK

After the shocking death of the Arconia's doorman, Charles (Steve Martin), Oliver (Martin Short), and Mabel (Selena Gomez) are back on the case and at the mic for another murder investigation. Though the death is deemed an accident, the podcasting trio knows better, and their own digging uncovers a handful of suspicious figures inside and surrounding their beloved building. This season's guest stars include Meryl Streep, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Richard Kind, Nathan Lane, Bobby Cannavale, Renée Zellweger, Logan Lerman, Christoph Waltz, Téa Leoni, Keegan-Michael Key, Beanie Feldstein, Dianne Wiest, Jermaine Fowler and more. —PK

When her son Daniel (Laurie Davidson) brings home a new girlfriend (Olivia Cooke), Laura (Robin Wright) can't help be protective. Cherry (Cooke) might be her son's dream woman, but Laura senses something amiss, and her suspicions lead her down a twisted path laden with shocking secrets. The series is based on Michelle Frances' novel and also stars Waleed Zuaiter, Tanya Moodie, Shalom Brune-Franklin, Karen Henthorn, Anna Chancellor, Leo Suter, and Francesca Corney. The series is adapted for television by Naomi Sheldon and Gabbie Asher, who serves as executive producers along with Wright, Will Tennant, Phil Robertson, John Zois, Dave Clarke, Gabbie Asher, and Michelle Frances. Jonathan Cavendish and Caroline Norris serve as producers. —PK

Joe Wright's adaptation of Antonio Scurati's bestseller finds its streaming home in September after debuting at the Venice Film Festival and TIFF. Luca Marinelli stars as one of the 20th century's most notorious figures, in what a press release calls a “scathing contemporary portrait” of Mussolini's rise to power and spread of dictatorship. The eight-part series was written by Stefano Bass an Davide Serino, with music from Tom Rowlands of The Chemical Brothers. —PK

It's the “Ozark” reunion you've been waiting for — just, you know, behind the camera. Jason Bateman and Laura Linney both direct episodes of “Black Rabbit,” a limited series (premiering at TIFF) about one brother's illicit debts, the other brother's inescapable vices, and the pressure cooker that results when both problems collide at the worst possible time.

Jake Friedken (Jude Law) has the hottest nightclub in New York City, but when Vince (Bateman) wedges his way into the family business, trouble — big, scary, mob-level trouble — soon threatens to destroy more than their in-demand restaurant and lounge. Joining Bateman and Linney in the director's chair is Justin Kurzel (“Nitram”), in a crime thriller from co-creators Zach Baylin (“King Richard”) and Kate Susman — all three of whom collaborated on last year's gritty gem, “The Order,” co-starring Jude Law. So there's more than one reunion at play in “Black Rabbit.” —BT

Ethan Hawke stars as journalist Lee Raybon in this series from “Reservation Dogs” creator Sterlin Harjo, where the Tulsa “truthstorian” faces daily conflicts in his battle against corruption and lies. Lee works as a “citizen journalist” outside his job at a bookstore and parenting a teen daughter (Ryan Kiera Armstrong), all of which are challenged by his journalistic endeavors when a prolific local dies by suicide. Harjo and Hawke executive produce the series along with Garrett Basch and Ryan Hawke, with the cast rounded out by Kaniehtiio Horn, Tim Blake Nelson, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Kyle MacLachlan, and Keith David. —PK

Mae Martin returns to Netflix not with a comedy series or standup special, but with this thriller co-created with Ryan Scott. In the remote and picturesque town of Tall Pines, a suspicious woman (Toni Colette) leads a “school” for troubled teens that might be the root of many of the town's hardships. Martin plays a police officer recently arrived in town whose brushes with Evelyn (Colette) lead further toward her terrifying secrets. Netflix calls the show “a thrilling and genre-bending limited series about the eternal struggle between one generation and the next, what happens when friendship and loyalty are put to the ultimate test, and how buried truths always find a way of coming to the surface.”

Sydney Topliffe and Alyvia Alyn Lind play two teens that are critical to Alex's investigation, with a cast that includes Sarah Gadon, Brandon Jay McLaren, Tattiawna Jones, Isolde Ardies, Joshua Close, Patrick J. Adams, Patrick Gallagher, Gage Munroe, and Byron Mann. Other executive producers include Jennifer Kawaja and Bruno Dubé, Ben Farrell and Hannah Mackay, and Euros Lyn, who will direct the series along with Renuka Jeyapalan and John Fawcett. —PK

Jessica Chastain stars in and as “The Savant,” an undercover online agent who monitors hate groups in an effort to curb domestic terrorism. Chastain and Kelly Carmichael executive produces the series from creator Melissa James Gibson, based on a “Cosmopolitan” article by series consultant Andrea Stanley. The cast includes Nnamdi Asomugha, Cole Doman, Jordana Spiro, Trinity Lee Shirley, Toussaint Francois Battiste, and guest star Pablo Schreiber. Other executive producers are Alan Poul, Melissa James Gibson, Matthew Heineman, David Levine, and Garrett Kemble. —PK

Glen Powell stars in this half-hour comedy that he co-created with Michael Waldron, about a quarterback attempting a comeback with a brand new identity. Based on the 2023 ESPN sketch starring Eli Manning (thereby following in the footsteps of “Ted Lasso”), the series showcases Powell and Waldron's passion for college football. Eli Manning, Peyton Manning, Jamie Horowitz, Ben Brown, Adam Fasullo, and Luv Rakhe also serve as executive producers, along with director Tony Yacenda (Waldron directed the finale, and co-wrote the pilot with Powell). —PK

In one of two new fall series starring Jason Clarke (what did we do to deserve such blessings, oh Lord?), “The Last Frontier” follows Frank Remnick (Clarke), a U.S. marshal patrolling Alaska when a prison transport plane crash lands in his cold, snowy, remote jurisdiction. Frank not only has to do his best to round up the escaped convicts while protecting the small town he calls home, but he also has to figure out why his Spidey sense keeps telling him this crash wasn't an accident.

Created by Jon Bokenkamp (“The Blacklist”) and Richard D'Ovidio, the 10-episode drama series co-stars Haley Bennett, Dominic Cooper, Simone Kessell, and Alfre Woodard. (Oh, and for the curious Clarke fans out there: You can also catch him in Hulu's true-crime adaptation, “Murdaugh: Death in the Family,” alongside J. Smith-Cameron and Patricia Arquette.) —BT

Cameron (Miles Heizer) is your everyday officer of the U.S. Marine Corps — except that he's gay and that's illegal, because it's the 1990s. Cameron and his best friend Ray (Liam Oh) navigate the armed forces with a new group of comrades while hiding and discovering their true selves in this series based on “The Pink Marine” by Greg Cope White. Creator Andy Parker serves as co-showrunner with Jennifer Cecil. The cast includes Vera Farmiga, Cedric Cooper, Ana Ayora, Angus O'Brien, Dominic Goodman, Kieron Moore, Nicholas Logan, Rico Paris, Blake Burt, Logan Gould, Zach Roerig, Johnathan Nieves, Brandon Tyler Moore, Ivan Hoey Jr., Anthony Marble, and Joy Osmanski. Normal Lear executive produces. —PK

It's the fall of workplace comedies and the world is healing! (Right?!) As the title suggests, this single-camera comedy from writer Dana Klein and director Trent O'Donnell takes place in the Department of Motor Vehicles, where employees and customers are in constant competition for who is the most disgruntled. Behind the counter are driving examiner Colette (Harriet Dyer), former teacher Gregg (Tim Meadows), Vic (Tony Cavalero) who had a previous life as a bouncer, new manager Barbara (Molly Kearney), surfer Noa (Alex Tarrant), and photographer Ceci (Gigi Zumbado) — a motley team who will band together at a place that tests everyone who enters. Klein, O'Donnell, Klein, Matt Kuhn, Aaron Kaplan, Wendi Trilling, and Robyn Meisinger serve as executive producers. —PK

Anne Rice's Immortal Universe continues its expansion at AMC with this six-episode series about a secret society called the Talamasca, which tracks witches, vampires, and other fantastical creatures. Nicholas Denton stars as a law school student invited to join the group that has been monitoring him since childhood, and meets Helen (Elizabeth McGovern), an experienced leader within the Talamasca. Also starring William Fichtner, Celine Buckens, Maisie Richardson-Sellers, with Jason Schwartzman slated to guest star. John Lee Hancock and Mark Lafferty serves as co-showrunners (Hancock will also direct), executive producing alongside Mark Johnson, Tom Williams, Christopher Rice, and Anne Rice. —PK

Erin Foster's charming rom-com returns for its second season following the romance of Joanne (Kristen Bell) and Noah (Adam Brody). After the whirlwind of their early dating and Noah struggling to integrate Joanne into his life, the couple's relationship gets more serious as the world around them pushes against it. Justin Lupe and Timothy Simons will reprise their roles as Joanne and Noah's siblings, respectively, with new cast members Leighton Meester, Miles Fowler, Alex Karpovsky, and Arian Moayed. Jenni Konner and Bruce Eric Kaplan have joined as executive producers and showrunners for Season 2. —PK

Emma Thompson and Ruth Wilson star in this eight-episode thriller from writer Morwenna Banks. After a home explosion in the suburbs of Oxford, one woman (Wilson) is determined to investigate the missing person involved in this disaster, with the help of private investigator Zoë Boehm (Thompson). The “complex conspiracy that reveals people long believed dead are still among the living, while the living are fast joining the dead,” Apple shared in a press release. Thompson and Banks serve as executive producers, as do Jamie Laurenson, Hakan Kousetta, Tom Nash, and author Mick Herron. Natalie Bailey serves as lead director for the series. —PK

If you wanted more backstory on the town terrorized by a demonic clown in Stephen King's “It” novels, you're in luck! “Welcome to Derry” brings Andy and Barbara Muschietti back to the dreaded streets of Derry, where a family of new residents begins to unpack the horrifying history of their new home. The Muschiettis developed the series with Jason Fuchs, who serves as co-showrunner with Brad Caleb Kane. David Coatsworth, Bill Skarsgård, Shelley Meals, Roy Lee, and Dan Lin are executive producers. The cast includes Taylour Paige, Jovan Adepo, Chris Chalk, James Remar, Stephen Rider, Madeleine Stowe, and Rudy Mancuso, with Skarsgård reprising his role as Pennywise the clown. —PK

Sarah Snook is back to bless our TVs in this Peacock drama from Megan Gallagher. When Melissa (Snook) goes to pick her son Milo up from his first play date, she finds no trace of the family she dropped him off with — and no one who has seen or heard of Milo, leading her on an urgent search, based on the novel by Andrea Mara. The series also stars Jake Lacy, Dakota Fanning, Michael Peña, Sophia Lillis, Abby Elliott, Daniel Monks, Jay Ellis, Thomas Cocquerel, Duke McCloud, and Kartiah Vergara, and is executive produced by Snook, Nigel Marchant, Gareth Neame, Joanna Strevens, Minkie Spiro, Christine Sacani, and Jennifer Gabler Rawlings. Spiro and Kate Dennis direct. —PK 

Vince Gilligan is back and teaming up once again with Rhea Seehorn for this nine-episode science fiction drama. The series logline calls it “a genre-bending original in which the most miserable person on Earth must save the world from happiness,” also starring Karolina Wydra and Carlos-Manuel Vesga with guest stars Miriam Shor and Samba Schutte. Gilligan executive produces alongside Gordon Smith, Alison Tatlock, Diane Mercer, Allyce Ozarski, and Jeff Frost. Jenn Carroll and Trina Siopy serve as co-executive producers. The series has already been renewed for a second season. —PK

A group of fugitives and outcasts band together in this animated series from Tasha Huo and Critical Role, in which a mysterious relic goes missing in the world of Exandria. The Mighty Nein, as they come to be known, are suspects as well as unlikely heroes, and the only ones stopping “The Beacon” from being misused when it falls into the wrong hands. The voice cast includes Laura Bailey, Liam O'Brien, Marisha Ray, Matthew Mercer, Sam Riegel, Travis Willingham, Taliesin Jaffe, and Ashley Johnson (who serve as executive producers), with guest stars Mark Strong, Alan Cumming, Tim McGraw, Ming-Na Wen, Auli'i Cravalho, Anika Noni Rose, Rahul Kohli, Robbie Daymond, and Jonathan Frakes. Chris and Shannon Prynoski, Antonio Canobbio, and Ben Kalina also executive produce. —PK

The final stand for Hawkins begins in the fall of 1987, where the boundary between our world and the upside down is not only breached but in danger of disappearing altogether. The show's heroes search fruitlessly for Vecna and try to protect Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) from government agents. Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Sadie Sink, Joe Keery, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Joe Keery, Maya Hawke, and Noah Schnapp return for the deadly final battle in the Duffer brothers' megahit series, which will release in three batches during the 2025 holiday season. —PK

In another fun reunion this fall, Netflix's eight-episode limited series reunites “Homeland” executive producer Howard Gordon and star Claire Danes for a mystery-thriller that skews closer to Mare Sheehan than Carrie Mathison. Famous author Aggie Wiggs (Danes) — what a name! — has gone into hiding since the death of her son. While normally not a problem for writers, Aggie can't put pen to paper anymore. That is, until the house next door is purchased by notable real estate mogul Nile Jarvis (Matthew Rhys), who may be better known for accusations against him regarding his wife's mysterious disappearance years earlier.

Aggie's curiosity draws her closer to Jarvis, but will her interest in his darkest truths spark life back into the struggling author — or be the end of her? Gordon is onboard as the showrunner, for a series created by Gabe Rotter (“The X-Files”), directed by Antonio Campos (“The Staircase”), and executive produced by Jodie Foster and Conan O'Brien. —BT

Fall entertainment offerings are filled with exciting ensembles, but I dare anyone to find another cast as deep and impressive as the one assembled to tell the story of President James Garfield and his greatest admirer turned assassin, Charles Guiteau. Michael Shannon leads the way as America's reluctant 20th president, with Matthew Macfadyen playing his eventual killer, and [deep breath] Betty Gilpin, Nick Offerman, Bradley Whitford, Shea Whigham, Paula Malcomson, Tuppence Middleton, Barry Shabaka Henley, Alistair Petrie, Vondie Curtis-Hall, and “Andor's” Kyle Soller rounding out the formidable supporting players. And who's the creator whose vision guides such a group, you may be wondering? How about “Bad Education” writer Mike Makowsky? How's that strike your fancy? Pretty freaking cool, huh? I think so. —BT

“Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” director Destin Daniel Cretton teams up with showrunner Andrew Guest for this series starring Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Simon Williams/Wonder Man, a superpowered stuntman who auditions to be a superhero. The Hollywood connection means the cast includes Ben Kingsley reprising his role as Trevor Slattery, last seen in “Shang-Chi.” Demetrius Grosse, Ed Harris, Arian Moayed, Lauren Glazier, Josh Gad, Byron Bowers, Béchir Sylvain, and Manny McCord round out the cast, and Cretton,  Stella Meghie, James Ponsoldt, and Tiffany Johnson will direct the series. —PK

A group of female divorce attorneys leave their firm to open a new practice in this series from Ryan Murphy starring Kim Kardashian, Naomi Watts, Niecy Nash-Betts, Teyana Taylor, and Matthew Noszka, with Sarah Paulson and Glenn Close. “Fierce, brilliant, and emotionally complicated, they navigate high-stakes breakups, scandalous secrets, and shifting allegiances — both in the courtroom and within their own ranks. In a world where money talks and love is a battleground, these women don't just play the game — they change it,” Hulu shared in a press release for the series. Murphy directs in addition to writing the series and executive producing along with Jon Robin Baitz, Joe Baken, Jamie Pachino, Lyn Greene and Richard Levine, Kardashian, Close, Watts, Nash-Betts, and Paulson. Kris Jenner, Alexis Martin Woodall, Eric Kovtun, Scott Robertson and Nissa Diederich also serve as executive producers, and Anthony Hemingway executive produces and directs. —PK

Garbage‘s forthcoming U.S. tour may be the last time the rock band performs in “many of the cities.” The group shared a post on Instagram confirming that they are “going out in style.”


	“Yesterday saw the commencement of rehearsals for our last North American headline tour,” the band wrote. “We haven't played an extensive headline tour like this one in the States for almost a decade. If the truth be told, it is unlikely we will play many of the cities on this tour ever again.”


	They continued, “We are going out in style and we hope you will join us. That's life my friends. Nothing stays the same forever. Everything must change.  All beautiful things come to an end. We love you.”

A post shared by 🩸garbage🩸 (@garbage)


	The tour kicks off on Sept. 3 in Orlando, with dates scheduled around the U.S. through November. The band will perform at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles on Nov. 5 before heading to Mexico City for Corona Capital on Nov. 14. The extensive run comes after the band were forced to cancel their 2024 dates last August when front woman Shirley Manson required “surgery and rehabilitation” after breaking her hip.

	“To be able to headline our own shows for the first time in nearly 10 years feels very special,” Manson told Rolling Stone earlier this year. “Because we are so much older, every time we get to go out and play together on a long tour, it feels like an enormous privilege, because you just never know when it's going to come 'round again.”

	Garbage's latest LP, Let All That We Imagine Be the Light, arrived in May. Manson said the title was inspired by the film All That We Imagine as Light, which came out last year. “I have not even seen the movie, but that title lodged itself in my brain,” she told Rolling Stone. “When we were working on [‘Radical'], I'd already sung, ‘All you've got to do is save a life,' and then I started singing ‘Let all that we imagine be the light' in the second half of the chorus. It fitted in with the music perfectly. It just seemed like such a perfect encapsulation of where my mind was at the time.”

	In May 2024, Kansas City Chiefs' head coach Andy Reid was working late when a bullet pierced the window of his office, landing a mere 15 feet away from him. Though the incident was kept under wraps for over a year, the shooting is currently being investigated as an aggravated assault, according to local police.


	The Kansas City Star reports that Reid was working from the team's practice facility late on May 4, 2024, when the bullet was fired at 12:15 a.m. from outside and pierced the window in his office. It landed inside a wall between the bathroom and his office door. Two more shots were fired, one landing in an air conditioning unit and another hitting the floor above Reid's office.


	“When officers arrived they were told by overnight security that someone in the building alerted them to hearing a noise and observed what appeared to be a bullet hole in a window,” a spokesperson for the police department said in a statement to People. There were no injuries, but because there were people inside the building, it is being investigated as aggravated assault.

	According to the Kansas City Police Department, no arrests have been made, and no signs point to this being a targeted incident at any person or organization. A source close to the situation told USA Today that the shooting is believed to be “random.”


	Still, the building has taken additional security measures in the year since. Bulletproof windows have been installed in Reid's office. The investigation remains ongoing.

	Lil Nas was hospitalized for a possible overdose after charging at officers in Studio City in the early hours of Thursday morning. The rapper was handcuffed before being transported to a local hospital. 


	The Los Angeles Police Department confirmed to Rolling Stone that a naked man was found walking down Ventura Boulevard at 5:50 a.m after several concerned witnesses called the police. While the LAPD did not confirm the rapper's name, TMZ shared video of the 26-year-old walking on the same street in his underwear, incoherently speaking to the person taping him, telling them to put the phone down before beginning to mimic a ballroom strut and making comments about a party.


	According to the LAPD, the man charged at officers after they attempted to approach him. He was then placed in handcuffs and transported to seek medical care for a possible overdose. 


	The artist, whose real name is Montero Hill, is currently still being treated at the hospital and could still potentially be charged for a crime by the police.

	A rep for Lil Nas X did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment. 


	Prior to the incident, Lil Nas X had made a flurry of bizarre posts on his Instagram page, after deleting all earlier posts two days prior. On Wednesday, he shared unreleased music over mirror selfies, his art, and piles of junk in what appears to be his home. His display name had been changed to “QUEEN MADELINE.”

	This is the rapper's second reported hospitalization this year, having shared a video from a hospital bed this April, explaining he had suffered from partial facial paralysis. He never shared publicly what caused the incident.

Matthew Stafford's back issue has sparked some bizarre theories. 

The Rams' veteran quarterback missed preseason action and most of training camp due to lingering back soreness — for which he's received epidurals to manage pain — and his wife, Kelly Stafford, is taking speculation over his health in stride.

Taking to her Instagram Story on Thursday, Kelly reposted a Barstool Sports headline that read, “The Best NFL conspiracy theory on the internet – Matthew Stafford died a couple weeks ago, got cloned, new one is now QB1 for the Rams.”

She added, “I knew there was something different about him….that @ammortal_official is wild.”

The most bizarre corners of social media have concocted the idea that Stafford has passed away — despite zero evidence to support the fact.

Kelly tagged Ammortal Inc, a company that her husband uses for their Ammortal Chamber, which is “the fastest way to reset, recharge and rejuvenate the body, mind and spirit,” according to its website. 

Earlier this month, Stafford used a mobile Ammortal Chamber that was inside of a trailer at a Rams practice, as seen in photos posted by reporters.  

Stafford returned to the field Monday for the first time this summer for practice in full pads.

Rams head coach Sean McVay told reporters after practice that Stafford participated in 26 plays of team drills, per the team's official website.

“It was good to be able to have Matthew out there. He did a good job today. I thought he looked good. I don't really have any updates,” McVay said. “We're going to keep it a day and really a week at a time, but it was great to be able to see him out there today. We'll see how this afternoon goes and tomorrow.”

If Stafford isn't ready for Week 1 against the Texans, veteran backup Jimmy Garoppolo would be the starter. Stetson Bennett, who shined in preseason, is next up on the depth chart.

The Rams close out the preseason against the Browns on Saturday.

Los Angeles is looking to build on its Divisional Round appearance last season, a 28-22 loss to the Eagles that proved to be Philadelphia's tightest postseason game en route to their Super Bowl win over the Chiefs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","The Atlantic Announces Emily Bobrow and Katie Zezima as Senior Editors; Will Gottsegen and Jonathan Lemire Join as Staff Writers","https://www.theatlantic.com/press-releases/archive/2025/08/atlantic-names-new-senior-editors-staff-writers/683953/","Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:15:28 GMT","

The Atlantic is announcing four new members of its editorial staff: Emily Bobrow and Katie Zezima will join as senior editors, both as part of the politics, global, and ideas team; Will Gottsegen was hired as a staff writer for The Atlantic's flagship newsletter, The Daily; and Jonathan Lemire, who has reported extensively on the Trump administration this year as a contributing writer, becomes a staff writer.

More details from our editors about all four journalists follow:

First, Emily Bobrow. She comes to us from The Wall Street Journal, where she is a features editor and reporter for the Review section, and where she has gained a wonderful reputation as a creative, thoughtful and supportive editor, commissioning and editing some of the Journal's most widely read pieces. Previously she wrote the Journal's Weekend Confidential column. She has worked as a staff editor and writer at The Economist, covering culture, politics, and policy. Some of you may recall that Emily has also contributed to our pages, writing for the Family section on how the pandemic would put marriage even further out of reach for many Americans.

Katie Zezima is joining us after 11 years at The Washington Post, where she earned a similarly wonderful reputation for her wise stewardship of some of the paper's most ambitious work. A story doctor par excellence, Katie has guided memorable journalism that has racked up accolades and exposed abuses. Katie has led coverage on a variety of subjects, but her focus lately has been nature's wrath: hurricanes, droughts, fires, and the rising seas. Katie joined the Post as a White House correspondent during the Obama Administration and she later hit the presidential campaign trail, traveling to 33 states with GOP candidates, all running doomed campaigns against a political neophyte. She previously reported for The New York Times and the Associated Press.

And a note about Jonathan Lemire, a journalism machine. He started with us as a contributing writer in January and has since published an impressive number of timely reports, taking readers inside the Trump administration's thinking, making a specialty of reporting on the president's foreign policy and a subspecialty of the Trump-Putin relationship. Before The Atlantic, Jonathan worked for Politico, the Associated Press, and the New York Daily News. He is the author of The Big Lie: Election Chaos, Political Opportunism, and the State of American Politics After 2020. Many of you know him because you've been interviewed by him on Morning Joe. Jon is a co-host of the show, and is seen on television roughly 22 hours every day. I've been on the show with him as he hosted and simultaneously reported for The Atlantic. It's an undeniably impressive trick.

Will Gottsegen is joining as a staff writer on the newsletters team. You'll likely recognize Will's byline from the excellent writing he's already done for us in recent years. He's explained Donald Trump's fixation on crypto to our readers, interviewed Sam Bankman-Fried weeks before his arrest, and catalogued SBF's downfall. Will started his journalism career as a music critic and has been on staff at CoinDesk, Billboard, and SPIN.  The clarity, humor, and sharpness of Will's writing make him a perfect fit for his new role as a Daily writer, where he will work alongside the indispensable David A. Graham to guide our newsletter readers through the biggest ideas and news of the day. David has deftly shouldered the Daily since taking over from the similarly indispensable Tom Nichols in February, and we're very excited about what David, Will, and the rest of the newsletter team will now be able to achieve together.

Recently announced editorial hires at The Atlantic include staff writers Tom Bartlett, Tyler Austin Harper, Anna Holmes, Sally Jenkins, Quinta Jurecic, Idrees Kahloon, Jake Lundberg, Toluse Olorunnipa, Alexandra Petri, Missy Ryan, Vivian Salama, Jamie Thompson, Josh Tyrangiel, and Nancy Youssef; and senior editors Drew Goins, Jenna Johnson, and Dan Zak.

In this article

Elon Musk's Tesla is facing a federal probe by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration after the U.S. auto safety agency found that the company was not reporting crashes as required.

According to documents posted to NHTSA's website on Thursday, the agency's Office of Defects Investigation had ""identified numerous incident reports"" from Tesla concerning crashes that had ""occurred several months or more before the dates of the reports"" to the agency.

The delayed reports were likely ""due to an issue with Tesla's data collection, which, according to Tesla, has now been fixed,"" according to NHTSA's explanation for the probe.

Automakers must report on collisions that occurred on publicly accessible roads in the U.S. that involved the use of either partially or fully automated driving systems in their cars within five days of the companies becoming aware of any crash.

The agency will now conduct an ""audit query"" to figure out if Tesla is in compliance with its reporting requirements, and to ""evaluate the cause of the potential delays in reporting, the scope of any such delays, and the mitigations that Tesla has developed to address them.""

NHTSA will also investigate whether Tesla neglected to report any prior relevant collisions, and whether its reports submitted to the safety regulator ""include all of the required and available data.""

Tesla stock was little changed Thursday.

The company sells electric vehicles equipped with a standard Autopilot system, or premium Full Self-Driving Supervised option, which is also known as FSD, in the U.S. Both require a driver at the wheel ready to steer or brake at any time.

A site that tracks Tesla-involved collisions drawing on news reports, police records and federal data, TeslaDeaths.com, has found at least 59 fatalities resulting from crashes where Tesla Autopilot or FSD were a factor.

The new NHTSA probe comes as Musk, Tesla's CEO, is trying to persuade investors that the company can become a global leader in autonomous vehicles, and that its self-driving systems are safe enough to operate fleets of robotaxis on public roads in the U.S.

A manned Tesla Robotaxi service launched in Austin, Texas in June, and the company is running another manned car service in the San Francisco Bay Area in California. Riders can book trips via the company's Tesla Robotaxi app.

Tesla has not begun driverless ride-hailing operations that would make it directly comparable to Alphabet-owned Waymo, or Baidu's Apollo Go and other autonomous vehicle competitors yet.

The company is facing a sales and profit decline, due, in part, to a consumer backlash against Musk's incendiary political rhetoric, his work to re-elect President Donald Trump, and his work leading the Department of Government Efficiency to slash federal spending and its workforce.

Still, many Wall Street analysts and shareholders remain optimistic about Musk's vision.

""We think it is a positive that Tesla has begun robotaxi operations which puts it on the path to addressing a large market (we estimate that the US robotaxi market will be $7 bn in 2030 as discussed in our recent AV deep dive report),"" Goldman Sachs autos industry analysts wrote in a note Wednesday.

Musk and Tesla have not given investors a sense of what they expect in terms of Robotaxi-related revenue or the technical performance of vehicles in its rideshare fleet, so a ""debate on the pace of robotaxi growth will continue,"" the research note said.

Sachia Vickery discusses OnlyFans account and $1,000 date deposit as she competed for a spot in the US Open this week.

As they say, time is money, and if you want some of emerging tennis star Sachia Vickery's time off the court, be prepared to spend big. 

The 30-year-old tennis pro, who competed in the U.S. Open qualifiers this week, addressed being on OnlyFans during a recent Instagram Q&A and revealed she now requires a $1,000 deposit to take her out on a date.

“I'm very open-minded and I don't care what people think of me,” Vickery said, per The Daily Mail, of any criticism she may face for her OnlyFans. “It's also the easiest money I've ever made, and I enjoy doing it.”

According to the New York Post, she added that she would never “talk s—” about OnlyFans girls again because “the amount I made on there in my first two days, I am overwhelmed. I am just shook really.”

A rep for the tennis player told People magazine that while Vickery posts “suggestive” content on the platform and despite reports made by other publications, what she does on OnlyFans “should not be considered ‘sex work.'” 

The statement clarified that Vickery doesn't post full nudity or sexual acts and that she pursued the platform after taking six months off for an injury. 

“Tennis was not stopped to go into OnlyFans,” the rep said. 

In addition to her virtual time being behind a paywall, Vickery explained in the Q&A why she also now charges $1,000 deposit to take her on a date. 

“I no longer date for free due to the behavior of men. I now require a pre-date deposit; send me $1,000, and we can make it happen. My Cash App is $Sachiavick,” she said, per The Daily Mail.

She later followed up with another post that featured her dancing in a bikini set to a Jessie Reyez song, doubling down on the pre-date deposit. 

“Imagine hating me and I'm in my room like this everyday,” she wrote. 

Later, she showed proof that she means business by posting a screenshot of a recent $1,000 payment she received for a date. 

“Y'all thought I was joking,” she wrote. 

Born and raised in Miramar, Florida, to Guyanese immigrant parents, Vickery debuted as a player in 2009 at the ITF $10k tournament. She was a standout junior player, winning the USTA Junior National Championship in 2013, and went on to reach a career-high ranking of world No. 73 in 2018. She's currently ranked No. 509. 

Her headline-making comments came as she battled for a spot in the main draw at this year's U.S. Open. She was her match's winner on Tuesday before losing out to German player Ella Seidel on Thursday.

The names are on the board, the paths are set. From the top seeds to the hopeful challengers, here's how the year's final Grand Slam is shaping up.

There will be no shortage of high-profile American women at this US Open.

Thursday's draw in New York revealed that half of the projected quarterfinalists -- No. 3 seed Coco Gauff, No. 4 Jessica Pegula, No. 6 Madison Keys and No. 8 Amanda Anisimova -- will be playing a home game in the season's last Grand Slam.

If the seeds hold, Gauff and Keys -- two of the three major champions already crowned this year -- would meet in a sizzling quarterfinal.

But the spotlight won't fall only on the Americans.

Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka was drawn into the same quarter as No. 7 Jasmine Paolini, setting up a potential showdown, while Iga Swiatek -- fresh off her Cincinnati title -- could see a rematch of the Wimbledon final against Anisimova.

We break down the draw:

Beyond these top seeds, this section includes some of the hottest players this summer. No. 9 Elena Rybakina just reached the semifinals at the Cincinnati Open, losing to eventual champion Iga Swiatek in a 7-5, 6-3 thriller. No. 14 Clara Tauson, a semifinalist in Montreal, meets ascendant Filipina Alexandra Eala in a first-round match. No. 24 Veronika Kudermetova, who reached the final four in Cincinnati, is on a collision course for a third-round meeting with Rybakina. No. 31 Leylah captured the title at the Mubadala Citi DC Open and could meet Sabalenka in the third round.

Projected quarterfinal: No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka vs. No. 7 Jasmine Paolini

Less than a month ago, 18-year-old Canadian Victoria Mboko was No. 85 in the PIF WTA Rankings. But after winning each of her seven matches at the Canadian Open, she rocketed into the Top 25 -- and secured seeding at the US Open. She's No. 22, but that didn't shield her from a dangerous path. She plays two-time Grand Slam champion Barbora Krejcikova in the first round and could see No. 10 Emma Navarro in the third. In a first-round match, No. 5 Andreeva draws Alycia Parks who just upset Navarro to reach the quarterfinals in Monterrey, Mexico.

Projected quarterfinal: No. 4 Jessica Pegula vs. No. 5 Mirra Andreeva 

Two of the three leading active Grand Slam champions reside in this section. Forty-five-year-old wild card Venus Williams has a first-round match against No. 11 Karolina Muchova. When she won her semifinal match over Elina Svitolina in Montreal, Osaka was thrilled that she'd be seeded in New York, where she won two of her four majors. She'll meet Greet Minnen in a first-round match. Playing the last Grand Slam of her career, wild card Caroline Garcia meets Kamilla Rakhimova.

Projected quarterfinal: No. 3 Coco Gauff vs. No. 6 Madison Keys

After winning the singles title in Cincinnati, Swiatek flew to New York and, with  less than a 12-hour turnaround, advanced with Casper Ruud to the mixed doubles semifinals on Tuesday. After beating top-seeded Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper in the final four, Swiatek and Ruud fell in the final to Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori. Swiatek's path in singles seems less daunting. After a first-round match against Emiliana Arango, she could meet two wild cards -- Valerie Glozman in the second round and, in the third, Clervie Ngounoue. Dangerous floaters in this sector: Danielle Collins, Maria Sakkari and Maya Joint.

Projected quarterfinal: No. 2 Iga Swiatek vs. No. 8 Amanda Anisimova
