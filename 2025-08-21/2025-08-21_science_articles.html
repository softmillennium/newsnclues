                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hurricane forecasts feature a “cone of uncertainty,” but what is it actually showing? If you've ever taken even a cursory glance at a hurricane forecast, you've seen some version of the “cone of uncertainty.” It sounds like some other-dimensional realm of indecision, but it's a mainstay for communicating hurricane forecasts. Though these maps pack in plenty of valuable information, it can be a bit tricky to interpret them if you don't know exactly what you're looking at. Here Scientific American walks you through all the forecast components and what they mean—and, almost as crucially, what they don't. We also point you to some other resources that are often the most helpful for those staring down an approaching storm. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Above is an example of what you might see if you visit the National Hurricane Center's (NHC's) website during a storm in progress—in this case it's an archived forecast from 2024's Hurricane Milton. Various broadcasters, news sites and other groups that cover the weather often have their own versions of this map. It's easier to forecast the near future than several days out. And because the error is based on that long-term forecast average, “you get the exact same cone all year long for every storm,” McNoldy says. “It isn't accounting for how big the storm is,” or if a storm's winds and rains are concentrated on one side, says Kim Wood, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Arizona. “It really makes no sense to look at the cone, see that you're outside of it and then ignore everything else,” Franklin says. The letters show whether a storm will be a tropical depression (D), tropical storm (S), hurricane (H) or major hurricane (M). A black circle means the storm is a tropical cyclone, or one that derives its strength from heat-driven convection at its core. READ MORE: Hurricane Science Has a Lot of Jargon—Here's What It All Means But these indicators are only based on a storm's wind speeds—they don't suggest anything about potential storm surge, rainfall or tornadoes, all of which can be threats from tropical cyclones. NHC forecasts—including the cone of uncertainty graphic—are useful, but they are intended mostly for other meteorologists and emergency managers that use that information to make more detailed local forecasts and decisions about where people should evacuate or position supplies. “The NHC is not issuing information for a person,” Wood says. Some researchers have explored making versions of the cone that are more useful for communicating threats. The researchers suggested that forecasts should show more hurricane paths to convey the uncertainty in where a hurricane would go. The graphic above is an example of such a visualization. The cone graphic as it exists now can still be useful when looking out four or more days before a storm might arrive to get a general sense of where it is now and where it is going—for example, if a storm in the Gulf of Mexico looks likely to curve into Florida, people in New Orleans may not need to be as alert. So where should you go for more useful hurricane information? The NHC also has maps that show when tropical-storm- and hurricane-force winds are likely to arrive at given locations and detailed maps showing expected storm surge levels. Much of this information is pulled together on the National Weather Service's Hurricane Threats and Impacts Tool, as well. This interactive map overlays the cone of a storm on top of wind, tornado, storm surge and rain threat information. One of the most important things to remember no matter what forecast you're looking at is that forecasts change. Human brains can naturally fall prey to the “anchoring effect”—we can become mentally rooted in one specific forecast and base our decisions on it rather than updating our thinking as conditions change. Maybe there's a particularly ominous forecast or a particularly good one for your location, “and then you don't keep looking for updates,” McNoldy says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tech companies are famous for having some of the world's most challenging and competitive interview processes. That's one reason why rumors tend to swirl around what it takes to get hired at giants like Facebook, Google, or Amazon. According to internet lore, you don't always just have to be prepared to tell a recruiter about your last big win, or your biggest mistake, or where you see yourself in five years. If the rumors are true, you might just have to be ready to answer a challenging math problem on the spot. A viral YouTube video claims that a prospective employee encountered one such problem during an Amazon job interview for software engineers and developers. A cable of 80 meters is hanging from the top of two poles that are both 50 meters off the ground. Turns out, it's a problem that can be traced back to at least one place, if not Amazon: a 2010 paper in the Atlantic Electronic Journal of Mathematics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Finding radiation in human food can be a pretty natural phenomenon. Bananas, for example, is technically radioactive, as it contains the naturally occurring isotope potassium-40. In fact, this is such a well-known source of agriculture radiation that scientists have informally labeled safe radiation levels as “banana equivalent dose” (or BED) for decades. Other times, however, radiation can enter the food supply in ways that are less than natural. Bahari Makmur Sejati, or BMS Foods—tested positive for unsafe levels of the radioactive isotope cesium-137. This is the most common isotope of cesium, and is used in a variety of industrial gauges, Geiger-Muller counters, and radiation therapy devices. But it's also a byproduct of nuclear fission, and traces of the isotope remain in the environment due to past nuclear weapons testing. The 1986 Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster, for instance, caused widespread distribution of cesium-137 throughout Europe. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that the isotope is so common that people are actually exposed to it every day at safe levels. However, if you were to ingest a particular package of shrimp sold at Walmart in several (mostly southern) U.S. states—including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, and West Virginia—you'd likely exceed those safe levels after repeated exposure. Although there's been no confirmation of radiation risk in food purchased at Walmart stores, the FDA said that it has detected unsafe levels of cesium-137 contamination at four U.S. ports. This contamination likely suggests that the shrimp was packaged in unsanitary conditions. “However, FDA has concluded that the level detected in the breaded shrimp sample could represent a potential health concern for those exposed to this level of Cs-137 from consumption of the shrimp over an extended period of time combined with radiation that exists in the environment and from other sources such as medical procedures.” Exposure to large amounts of cesium-137 can cause severe burns, radiation sickness, and even death. While exposure to low-level radiation isn't nearly as dire, it's not an experience you want to repeat over a long period of time. This exposes them to both beta and gamma radiation that can increase cancer risk.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have found that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in children. Until now, acetaminophen has been considered the safest option for managing headache, fever, and other pain. Analysis by the Mount Sinai-led team of 46 studies incorporating data from more than 100,000 participants across multiple countries challenges this perception and underscores the need for both caution and further study. The Navigation Guide Systematic Review methodology is a gold-standard framework for synthesizing and evaluating environmental health data. "Given the widespread use of this medication, even a small increase in risk could have major public health implications." Acetaminophen is known to cross the placental barrier and may trigger oxidative stress, disrupt hormones, and cause epigenetic changes that interfere with fetal brain development. "Pregnant women should not stop taking medication without consulting their doctors," Dr. Prada emphasized. "Untreated pain or fever can also harm the baby. With diagnoses of autism and ADHD increasing worldwide, these findings have significant implications for public health policy, clinical guidelines, and patient education.

Reviewers are more likely to approve a manuscript if their own work is cited in subsequent versions than reviewers who are not cited, according to an analysis of 18,400 articles from four open access publications. The study, which is yet to be peer reviewed, was posted online as a preprint earlier this month. The study was inspired by anecdotes from authors who cited articles only because reviewers asked them to, says study author Adrian Barnett, who researches peer review and metaresearch at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia. But if reviewers ask for too many citations or the reason to cite their work is not justified, the peer-review process can become transactional, says Barnett. Requesting unnecessary or unjustified requests for citations, sometimes called coercive citation, is generally considered poor practice. Balazs Aczel, a psychologist who studies metascience at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, says that the latest work isn't the first to investigate reviewers asking for citations, but that the number of peer reviews included and level of analysis is novel. But reviewers who suggested that their own research be cited were about half as likely to approve the article than reject it or express reservations. Barnett also analysed 2,700 reviewer comments and identified the 100 most frequently used words. He found that reviewers who requested citation were more likely to use words such as ‘need' or ‘please' in their comments when they rejected an article, which he says suggests that coercive language was used. Jan Feld, a metascience researcher at the Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, is not convinced that such language is a sign of coercion. There are other explanations for reviewers rejecting an article than the author refusing to cite their work. He doesn't doubt that reviewers request citations that are not warranted, but they can recommend citations, including of their own work, to address issues they've identified.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In film, a splotch of crimson blood hitting a white square of cotton is often visual shorthand for “this is not good.” Obviously, in real life, bloodstains aren't usually positive omens either, but it turns out that they may at least be helpful. In a new study published in the journal Forensic Science International, a team of North Carolina State University researchers analyzed the dynamics of blood droplets falling on three different types of cotton fabrics. The goal was to work backwards from a bloodstain to the splatter of blood that created it, all by better understanding how the blood behaves when it hits fabric. “When blood strikes fabric, it leaves a stain,” Tiegang Fang, one of the authors of the study, said in a statement. “But it can be difficult to accurately assess things like how quickly blood was traveling when it struck the fabric. Did someone just brush up against the blood? “When you look at a bloodstain on fabric, you will sometimes see thin tendrils that spread out from the center of the stain. However, over time, these fingers may spread out and run together.” The study text noted that when blood drops hit a fabric, they spread and form rims. Fang called the results of the study “promising,” and plans additional research with a wider variety of fabrics, weaves, and yarns. “It's clear,” he said, “that the specific structures of each surface play a critical role in how these bloodstains form and what we can learn from them.” Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

Nature Communications volume 16, Article number: 7788 (2025) Cite this article Chiral purity is crucial in life sciences, emphasizing the importance of precise enantiomeric identification and the development of analytical techniques. Here, we design functional dyes with visual chiral recognition capabilities by introducing recognition units 2-amino-1,2-diphenylethanol into vibration-induced emission molecules. The unambiguous differentiation in luminescent colors upon binding to enantiomers facilitates the efficient recognition of enantiomers and the analysis of enantiomeric excess. The chiral recognition process originates from co-assembly under charge-aided hydrogen bonding interactions, which is significantly impacted by the steric hindrance effect, and further affects the planarization of the excited state conformation of the dye. This co-assembly process precisely amplifies the dynamics at the molecular level into macroscopic observable signals for real-time, highly sensitive recognition. Furthermore, we establish a sophisticated optical analysis system by correlating Red-Green-Blue values and CIE coordinates to analyze the enantiomeric excess of chiral molecules. This work opens a distinct avenue for visual chiral recognition and inspires the development of advanced optical materials in chiral sensing chemistry. Chirality, a fundamental aspect of molecular structure, plays a pivotal role in various fields ranging from pharmaceuticals to materials science; therefore, the ability to discern and separate enantiomers is of paramount importance1,2,3,4,5. Luminescence-based techniques have emerged as a compelling alternative to High-performance liquid chromatography, offering the advantages of simplicity, high speed and the potential for real-time monitoring6,7,8,9,10,11. Nevertheless, the sensitivity of macroscopic measurements in chiral recognition processes is often diminished due to the influence of ensemble averaging effects. Although scientists have achieved numerous research outcomes in the field of developing chiral recognition technologies using functional dyes12,13,14,15, there remains an urgent demand for facile, rapid and sensitive chiral recognition products. The pivotal and challenging lie in exploiting the differential interactions between the dye and the enantiomers to precisely modulate the emission energy levels of dyes, thereby enabling high-sensitivity discrimination between enantiomers16,17,18. A recent study from Tian's group indicated that a class of fluorophore exhibited the vibration-induced emission (VIE) effect19,20,21. The molecules in solution undergo an excited-state configuration transformation, inducing the effective p-conjugation thus emitting red fluorescence. While in the solid or aggregation state, the physical constraint blocked the planarization of the structure in the excited state, result in an emission of intrinsic blue light. Unlike traditional fluorophores, VIE dyes exhibit fluorescence that is dynamically modulated by changes in their microenvironment22,23. This sensitivity of the excited state allows for the amplification of subtle variations in assembly within the chiral space, rendering VIE dyes particularly suitable for chiral discrimination. utilized VIE with graphene to construct a single-molecule device, enabling in situ and real-time direct observation of chirality recognition at the single-molecule level through the discrimination of electrical conductance states. However, sample pretreatment before instrumental detection and following analysis were carried out under harsh conditions. Here, we were committed to accurately amplify the microscale dynamic variations at the single-molecule level to a macroscopic state that is perceptible to the unaided eye, thereby facilitating real-time, highly sensitive, and visual chirality discrimination. Hence, we designed and synthesized functional materials with visual chiral recognition capabilities by introducing recognition units 2-Amino-1,2-Diphenylethanol into VIE molecules. As shown in Fig. 1, by utilizing the selective co-assembly mechanism between the dyes and chiral small molecules, we precisely modulated the excited-state conformation of VIE dyes under assembly conditions. The differentiation in luminescent color enabled the recognition of enantiomers and the analysis of enantiomeric excess. Additionally, by employing digital photography and handheld optical detector for the quantification Red-Green-Blue (RGB) values and CIE coordinates with the enantiomeric excess, thereby establishing an optical display system for analyzing the enantiomeric excess of chiral small molecules. a Structures of chiral molecules (1S,2 R)- and (1 R,2S)-DPAC. b Schematic representation of the visualization of enantiorecognition. The chiral color indicator was obtained by introducing chiral recognition auxiliary (1S,2 R)- or (1 R,2S)−1,2-diphenyl-2-aminoethanol into VIE dyes with an alkyl chain as a bridging unit (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for details of the chemical structure). 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and electronic spray ionization (ESI) high-solution mass spectroscopy analyses were employed to confirm their structures (detailed characterization data see Supplementary Figs. The 1,2-diphenyl-2-aminoethanol moiety serves as the impetus for chiral recognition, attributable to its enantiomer-specific “oriented attachment” interactions with chiral molecules. The precise orientation and spatial arrangement enable it to form specific non-covalent interactions25,26,27. As shown in the fluorescence spectra, (1S,2 R)-DPAC exhibited typical vibration-induced emission properties, which presented different emissive behaviors in solid state and solution, indicating that the introduction of the chiral recognition auxiliary will not affect the transformation on the excited-state configuration of the VIE dye (Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Fig. a Schematic illustration of the VIE mechanism. b The absorbance and fluorescence spectra of (1S,2 R)-DPAC, [(1S,2 R)-DPAC] = 1.0 × 10−5 M in acetone, λex = 350 nm.

[(1S,2 R)-DPAC] = 1.0 × 10−4 M in cyclohexane/acetone 5:1, λex = 350 nm. Subsequently, we undertook an analytical assessment to quantify the stereoselective binding affinity of (1S,2 R)-DPAC for enantiomeric analytes. As shown in fluorescence spectra (Fig. 2c), the fluorescence curve of the freshly prepared (1S,2 R)-DPAC solution showed a strong red emission at 600 nm. The addition of (1 R,2 R)-cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid (R-1) resulted in a significant decrease in fluorescence intensity at 600 nm, along with the appearance of a emission band at 460 nm. The sample exhibited a perceptible color transformation from an initial red to a distinct blue, and after the addition of 2.0 equivalents of R-1, results in no discernible alteration in photoluminescence. Comparatively, upon the incorporation of a chiral compound with an alternative stereoisomeric conformation (1S,2S)-cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid (S-1), the resultant luminescent perturbation within the system was observed to be markedly attenuated (Fig. Due to the dual emission characteristics of the VIE, the ratiometric fluorescence (I460 nm/I600 nm) exhibited significant variation in response to the titration of chiral compounds with different conformations. Additionally, we consequently investigated the optimal concentration and solvent ratio to maximize the visual discrimination capability (Supplementary Figs. Hence, examination of the photo and the CIE coordinated diagram revealed that the luminescent properties exhibited pronounced differences when various enantiomers were introduced under optimal conditions (Fig. And the high quantum yield of this process facilitated the visual discrimination of chirality without the necessity for laborious multistep operation (Supplementary Fig. This streamlined approach significantly enhanced the efficiency and applicability of chiral detection (Supplementary Movie 1). Based on the above-mention phenomenon, we investigated other common aromatic chiral compounds and amino acids, (1S,2 R)-DPAC consistently demonstrated exceptional capability in visual chiral discrimination. Upon the addition of 2.0 equivalents of chiral compounds with different conformations, either of them exhibited a distinct luminescent disparity in cyclohexane/acetone (5/1, v/v) (Supplementary Figs. Leveraging this property, we achieved the quick recognition of the chiral compound configurations by simple visible inspection. This encompasses amino acids and their derivatives, chiral acids, as well as pharmaceuticals such as mandelic acid, among others, which demonstrate a broad generalizability (Table 1 and Supplementary Figs. Given the distinctive nature of structure 1,2-diphenyl-2-aminoethanol, which possesses two chiral centers, it is not predestined to manifest a heightened binding affinity exclusively for the R-enantiomer. Conversely, there are scenarios wherein a more pronounced affinity is observed with the S-enantiomer. Nonetheless, the variable binding affinities associated with different conformational molecules invariably facilitate the enantioselective recognition capability. Drawing upon the principles of VIE, the observed pronounced variations in photoluminescent emission may be ascribed to the formation of diverse molecular aggregational states. Within these structurally rigidified assemblies, the process of excited-state planarization induced by vibration was markedly attenuated, which in turn engenders the emission of intrinsic blue fluorescence. Hence, from the perspective of morphology characterization to confirm our hypothesis, the self-assembly process was investigated by dynamic light scattering (DLS). In this particular mixed solvent system, the introduction of chiral molecules into a (1S,2 R)-DPAC system resulted in a discernible alteration in the particle size of the dye, thereby substantiating the formation of diverse assemblies (Fig. In the absorption spectra, the scattering effects that arise from the formation of aggregates were also be clearly observed (Supplementary Fig. Besides, the rigidification effect of the assembly efficiently suppressed the non-radiative transition of fluorescence, resulting in a significant enhancement of the luminescence lifetimes at both 460 nm and 600 nm (Fig. a The DLS of (1S,2 R)-DPAC after being mixed with R/S-1. b The fluorescence spectra of (1S,2 R)-DPAC after being mixed with HCl in different ratios. c The luminescent delay lifetimes of (1S,2 R)-DPAC after being mixed with R/S-1. d The fluorescence spectra of (1S,2 R)-DPAC after being mixed with R-Dic and D-Glu.

The principal determinant of enantioselectivity is predominantly the enthalpic variations, with the phenomenon of enthalpy-entropy compensation likewise identified as a significant factor in modulating enantioselectivity28,29,30. The amino group within the molecular structure of (1S,2 R)-DPAC was recognized as an efficacious proton receptor, which was predisposed to engage in the formation of ionic complexes in an acidic milieu. We speculate that the solubility of the formed ionic compound will decrease, which was a pivotal factor in the formation of aggregates and the alteration of the excited-state conformation of VIE molecules. Subsequently, we employed an inorganic acid (hydrochloric acid) to facilitate the precipitation of ionic compounds via titration methodology. As illustrated in the Fig. 3b, with the increment of hydrochloric acid at various molar ratios, (1S,2 R)-DPAC manifested an analogous trend in luminescence variation. Furthermore, two reference compounds were chosen for this investigation: R-Dic, which is devoid of proton-donating capability, and D-Glu, characterized by its enhanced basicity. The results indicated that neither of these compounds could induce the formation of the (-NH2+-) structure in (1S,2 R)-DPAC, consequently failing to cause a change in luminescent color (Fig. Therefore, the assembly of (1S,2 R)-DPAC with chiral acid molecules were orchestrated through charge-aided hydrogen bonding interactions, which acted as the impetus for the modulation of photoluminescent properties. In pursuit of a profound elucidation of the operational mechanisms governing the enantioselective recognition process, 1H NMR titration was utilized to delineate the specific binding sites where the (1S,2 R)-DPAC engaged with chiral molecular entities. However, due to the precipitation of molecular aggregates resulting from solubility diminished upon the mixed (1S,2 R)-DPAC with R-1 in (CD3)2CO, which impedes the detection of intermolecular interaction signals in 1H NMR, we opted to utilize CDCI3 as a solvent medium. As illustrated in the provided Fig. 3e, the assembly of (1S,2 R)-DPAC with R-1 results in a significant perturbation of the proton resonances for both constituents. The acquired amino group (-NH2+-) exhibits a significant capacity to diminish the electron density surrounding adjacent protons, thereby inducing a pronounced downfield displacement in the NMR spectral profile. These results conclusively demonstrate that the formation of -NH2+- are pivotal for the altered luminescence and the basis for visual chiral characterization. Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) reflects the excited-state structural information of chiral luminescent systems31,32,33. Upon the addition of enantiomers, the CPL of (1S,2 R)-DPAC exhibited a trend consistent well with its fluorescence spectra. The constancy in the direction of the circular dichroism (CD) and CPL spectrum suggested that the interaction with chiral small molecules does not induce any modification to the chiroptical configuration of (1S,2 R)-DPAC (Fig. Accordingly, upon unequivocally establishing the non-occurrence of configurational inversion, we performed geometric optimization based on the B3LYP/6-311 g* model to determine of the atomic configuration of a molecule in its lowest energy state. The calculated energies of (1S,2 R)-DPAC after being mixed with R/S-1 indicate that their prefers to stack in a U-pattern with lower potential energy (Fig. Based on this optimal structure, we employed the M06-2X/DEF2-TZVP suite to calculate the interaction energies between (1S,2 R)-DPAC and the enantiomers of R/S-1. After the counterpoise correction, the interaction energies of (1S,2 R)-DPAC with the R and S enantiomers were determined to be −22.49 kcal/mol and −19.49 kcal/mol, respectively. Additionally, the binding behavior between (1S,2 R)-DPAC and R/S-1 was estimated by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments. The ITC data unambiguously reveal the disparities in binding constants among enantiomers (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. a The CPL of (1S,2 R)-DPAC after being mixed with R/S-1. [(1S,2 R)-DPAC] = 1.0 × 10−4 M in cyclohexane/acetone 5:1, [(1S,2 R)-DPAC]/[enantiomers] = 1/2, λex = 350 nm. b ITC data for (1S,2 R)-DPAC with R-1 in acetone.

Furthermore, disparities in the interactions were also found through morphological characterization. The interaction of (1S,2 R)-DPAC with R/S-1 of distinct conformations engenders a pronounced disparity in particle number. Specifically, the assembly was formed subsequent to the interaction with R-1 compounds and exhibited an augmented particle size and a concomitant increase in quantity (Supplementary Figs. Hence, upon the encounter of an enantiomer of an acid with an appropriate stereochemical configuration that is compatible with (1S,2 R)-DPAC, an aggregate was formed resulting from solubility diminished. This aggregation inhibits the planarization of the excited state of (1S,2 R)-DPAC induced by vibration, culminating in the emission of blue light (Fig. Therefore, any condition parameters that can modulate the solubility of the aggregates will concomitantly impact the alterations in emission characteristics (Supplementary Fig. The enantiomeric acids' stereoselective assembly with (1S,2 R)-DPAC endows the supramolecular complex with tunable luminescent properties. The luminescence distinctions arising from these wavelength variations will render the differentiation between enantiomers more pronounced, which hold promise for the development of analytical techniques with high fidelity and sensitivity for the quantification of enantiomeric excess (ee%) in chiral small molecules. Upon maintaining the molar ratio of (1S,2 R)-DPAC to the chiral molecule at 1:2, a systematic attenuation of the ratiometric fluorescence (I460 nm/I600 nm) intensity of (1S,2 R)-DPAC was observed in correlation with the enantiomeric excess, spanning the complete spectrum from +100% to −100% (Fig. Conversely, (1 R,2S)-DPAC manifests a near-perfect mirror symmetry. A pronounced nonlinear relationship exists between the ratiometric fluorescence intensity and the enantiomeric excess. Consequently, by fitting the curve, it served as a calibration curve for determining the enantiomeric composition of unknown ee % values. This allowed quantitative determination of the ee% from the fluorescence spectral changes. Furthermore, the establishment of a relationship between ratiometric fluorescence intensity and ee% allowed for the circumvention of the influence of testing conditions on the detection signal. Hence, we determined several sets of unknown samples under various testing conditions, yielding an average absolute error (AAE) between the measured and actual ee values of 2.55% ee (Supplementary Fig. 22 and Supplementary Table 1). a Change of relative fluorescence intensity ratios of 460 nm/600 nm of (1S,2 R)- or (1 R,2S)-DPAC after being mixed with various enantiomer content of R/S-1.

(Data with error bars are expressed as mean ± s.d., n = 3 independent samples). e The schematic cartoon illustration of the enantiomer excess analysis. [(1S,2 R)- or (1 R,2S)-DPAC] = 1.0 × 10−4 M in cyclohexane/acetone 5:1, [(1S,2 R)- or (1 R,2S)-DPAC]/[R/S-1] = 1/2, λex = 350 nm. Distinct variations in the luminescent color under different ee% were readily discernible from both the CIE diagram and the images (Fig. Such pronounced alterations in luminescent color allowing approximate determination of the ee% values by visual inspection, offer a constructive strategy for the development of a visualizable ee% colorimetric sensor. Henceforth, we procured photographic documentation of luminescent emissions across a spectrum of ee% values. Nevertheless, acknowledging the inherent variability in the photosensitive components among disparate imaging apparatuses and the potential for environmental luminance to exert influence over the photographic outcome, we implemented a standard color reference card to correct for the veracity of the luminescent conditions exhibited by the specimens (Supplementary Figs. Hence, employing digital photographic techniques, the unknown specimens were rendered into their respective red, green and blue values (Fig. However, the variation in RGB values exhibits a linear relationship only at specific values of ee%, which may slightly affect practical applications. Subsequently, we employed a handheld optical testing instrument capable of directly acquiring optical data from the samples, such as CIE coordinates. Consequently, we plotted the relationship between CIE coordinates and the ee%, which demonstrated a significant linear correlation. This approach substantially enhanced the sensitivity and convenience of the detection process (Fig. 5d and supplementary Table 2). Thereby, it is possible to deduce the ee% of said samples through an analysis of the luminance profiles across the RGB channels or CIE coordinates without using any spectroscopic instruments (Fig. The simplicity of this strategy demonstrates significant potential in the identification of chiral reagents. In conclusion, a functional probe with visual chiral recognition capabilities by introducing recognition units 2-amino-1,2-diphenylethanol into vibration induced emission molecules was designed and synthesized. By leveraging non-covalent interactions to drive the selective assembly between dyes and chiral small molecules, we meticulously modulated the excited-state conformation of VIE dyes. This precise manipulation enabled the visual discrimination of various chiral compounds. Besides, the differentiation in luminescent colors enabled the recognition of enantiomers and the analysis of enantiomeric excess. into RGB values and CIE coordinates and subsequent quantification, an optical display system was established for the analysis of enantiomeric excess in chiral small molecules. This strategy provides a facile and convenient method for enantioselective recognition and the analysis of enantiomeric excess. All solvents employed were commercially available and used as received without further purification. All enantiomers were commercially available and used as received without further purification (Purity >98%). The molecular structures were confirmed using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and high-resolution ESI mass spectroscopy or MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker AV-400 and Ascend 600 spectrometer. The ESI high-resolution mass spectra were tested on a Waters LCT Premier XE spectrometer. The UV-Vis absorption spectra and PL spectra were performed on a Varian Cray 500 spectrophotometer and a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer at 25 °C, respectively. Quantum yields were measured by using an integrating sphere on a HAMAMATSU Quantaurus-QY C11347-11. DLS was carried out on a MALVERN, ZETA SIZER, model ZEN3600, 25 °C. CPL spectra were acquired using the JASCO CPL-200 spectrofluoropolarimeter. CD spectra were acquired using the JASCO J815 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence lifetimes were measured on Edinburgh Instruments Fluorescence Spectrometer (FLS1000). No special instructions, the photos were taken by Canon 60D, UV irradiation source was used from tunable 365 nm LED lamp with 16.7 mW/cm2. The handheld optical testing instrument was used from Hangzhou LCE Intelligent Detection Instrument Co., Ltd. HP 320. SEM images were obtained by using a S-3400N (droplets of the sample solution (1 ×10−5 M) were applied to a silicon slice and dried in air at room temperature, and then coated with nano Au in a vacuum).

A brain-imaging study of people with amputated arms has upended a long-standing belief: that the brain's map of the body reorganizes itself to compensate for missing body parts. But the latest findings, published in Nature Neuroscience on 21 August2, reveal that the primary somatosensory cortex stays remarkably constant even years after arm amputation. “Pretty much every neuroscientist has learnt through their textbook that the brain has the capacity for reorganization, and this is demonstrated through studies on amputees,” says study senior author Tamar Makin, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge, UK. “We shouldn't take anything for granted, especially when it comes to brain research.” It could also help scientists working to restore sensation in people who have had amputations. These maps are responsible for processing sensory information, such as touch or temperature, at specific body regions.

Nature Chemical Biology (2025)Cite this article Protein and polypeptide heteropolymers containing non-α-backbone monomers are highly desirable as potential materials and therapeutics but many remain difficult or impossible to biosynthesize in cells using traditional genetic code expansion. Here we describe a next-generation approach to such materials that relies instead on proximity-guided intramolecular rearrangements that edit the protein backbone post-translationally. This approach relies on orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes that accept α-hydroxy acid monomers whose side chains contain masked nucleophiles. Introduction of such an α-hydroxy acid into a protein translated in vivo, followed by nucleophile unmasking, sets up a thermodynamically favored intramolecular backbone extension acyl rearrangement (BEAR) reaction that edits the protein to install an extended-backbone monomer. In the examples described here, BEAR reactions are used to generate protein heteropolymers containing a β-backbone, γ-backbone or δ-backbone. This report represents a general strategy to install extended backbones into genetically encoded proteins and peptides expressed in cells.
