                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Formula 1 fashion has moved from grid glamour to everyday style. Since his rookie season in 2019, Lando's style has evolved from the familiarity and simplicity of his papaya McLaren team kit to a playful mix of casual comfort and polished luxury. "I don't think of myself as stylish," the McLaren man told Vogue with typical self-awareness. "But people want to see who we are, not just our helmets". That sums up this shift – F1 style today is about personality, identity and the way drivers choose to express themselves, both on and off the track. The McLaren driver's early look epitomised a British teenager whose life revolved around racing. That stripped-back yet slightly personal touch resonated with younger fans, who saw in him a version of themselves; casual, relatable, and more interested in being comfortable than conforming to old-school style codes. Still, there were always hints of personality, whether it was an unexpected pop of colour, a playful accessory, or a casual twist to the kit that suggested his style instincts were there from the start, just waiting to surface. During 2020, Lando began turning that identity into something bigger with the launch of Quadrant. His own lifestyle brand reflected exactly who he was at the time with a range of hoodies and graphic tees; bright, playful, youthful and firmly Gen Z. "So, I think that's what makes it a lot better." In the paddock, he can also lean into sharper, more polished looks that show how far he's come from hoodies and sweats. That versatility hasn't gone unnoticed, as fashion houses have tapped him to front several campaigns – such as Dior, Ralph Lauren and Tumi – a sign that the industry sees his appeal beyond racing. "So, I think that's what makes it a lot better." Even as his wardrobe evolves, he stays grounded, blending everyday hoodies with the occasional designer look. Lando walks the paddock ahead of the 2025 Belgian Grand Prix wearing a jersey style shirt from his own brand Quadrant. Lando's style doesn't follow the familiar F1 script of sharp tailoring and high-gloss appearances that so many other drivers have adhered to over the years. Instead, it reflects the broader mood of his generation – fluid, playful, and unbothered by the idea of being ‘fashion perfect'. That outlook is what makes his aesthetic resonate with fans. He's less concerned with trends than with expressing his personality, whether that's through a designer campaign or a quick TikTok fit-check. His appeal lies in the consistency: comfort, authenticity, and a refusal to treat fashion as something separate from everyday life. If people think it looks good, then great.” It's a sentiment that could easily sit on any Gen Z mood board, and explains why his style has become part of his public identity outside of his performances. In an era where drivers are as much cultural figures as athletes, Lando embodies how fashion can be approachable without losing relevance. Part of what makes Lando's style resonate with so many is the way it's experienced. Unlike earlier eras of F1, where fans only saw drivers in curated magazine shoots or sponsor appearances, Lando's fashion lives in the immediacy of Twitch streams, TikTok edits, Instagram posts, and candid paddock walk clips. His outfits don't exist in isolation – they circulate, get memed, clipped, and reinterpreted by fans online. That dynamic has shaped how his aesthetic is perceived. A hoodie or a football jersey isn't just clothing – it becomes part of a shared culture between Lando and his fanbase, one that blurs the line between athlete, streamer, and fashion figure. His style doesn't demand attention through extravagance; instead, it gathers momentum through relatability, repeatability, and the viral loops of a digital fandom. In a sport where image has always been paramount, Lando shows how fashion can thrive in the era of content; not as a polished billboard, but as an ongoing, interactive story.</p>
