                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Paramount+‘s Head of Originals Jane Wiseman has made her first move with a high-profile hire. She is bringing in Chris Parnell, most recently an Apple TV+ creative executive and previously co-president of Sony Pictures TV Studios, to her team at the streamer overseen by Cindy Holland, Paramount's Chair of Direct-to-Consumer. Ever since former Netflix Head of Comedy Wiseman was named Head of Originals for Paramount+ two weeks ago, upon the close of Skydance's acquisition of Paramount Global, there had been chatter that she may recruit a seasoned executive with drama background. 2025 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming 'Mayor Of Kingstown' Season 4 Teaser Trailer Sees Edie Falco's Debut As Warden Nina Hobbs -  Update He has extensive experience in drama — both at Sony TV, where he rose through the drama ranks to co-head of the department, and at Apple. He also has overseen comedy and will shepherd projects across both genres for Paramount+. A well-liked executive, Parnell is known for his passion for everything comic book/genre/geek stuff-related, which he would apply to signature Paramount IP, including Paramount+'s Star Trek franchise, which the streamer's new leadership is looking to further expand. Parnell is joining Paramount+ from another streamer, Apple TV+, where he served as a senior creative executive of US Television under Matt Cherniss for the past five years. There, he was involved in developing such scripted series as Dark Matter, Neuromancer, The Last Frontier, Bad Monkey and Vince Gilligan's upcoming Pluribus, reuniting with the Breaking Bad creator with whom he had worked at Sony TV. Parnell also led the development of AppleTV+'s original content for the Apple Vision Pro launch, including the platform's first full immersive series Adventure and first full-length spatial film Bono: Stories Of Surrender (immersive). Before joining Apple TV+ in 2020, Parnell spent 16 years at Sony TV, including stints as co-head of U.S. drama development and programming and ultimately co-president of SPT Studios, guiding all creative aspects of the studio's domestic television business alongside fellow former co-president Jason Clodfelter. Over the years, Parnell helped develop such broadcast, cable, and streaming series as For All Mankind, Outlander, The Boys, The Blacklist, Better Call Saul, The Boys, Timeless, Preacher, Wheel of Time, Electric Dreams and Zombieland, which later became a feature for Columbia Pictures.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Packaged with exclusive photos and poetry penned by the 14-time Grammy winner, the new “Baby, That's Show Business” edition comes in two disc colors — lovely bouquet orange and lakeside beach blue — and features Swift in a yellow feather headdress and bedazzled lingerie, performing on a stage with a pack of other showgirls, on the cover. Fans should also take note that they have just two days to get their hands on the new variant, with a disclaimer on Swift's website emphasizing that it's only available — while supplies last — for the next 48 hours. The announcement comes just a couple of days after Swift dropped the first vinyl Showgirl variant, which was also available for just two days after a purple countdown heralded its arrival hours prior. Also on New Heights — the full episode featuring Swift arrived Aug. 13 — the songwriter shared more details about Showgirl, including its main cover art and tracklist. Featuring production fro Max Martin and Shellback and a collaboration with Sabrina Carpenter on the title track, the full-length is full of back-to-back “bangers,” according to Swift. “[The album is] a lot more upbeat, and it's a lot more fun pop excitement,” she said on the podcast.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Ne Zha 2 finally graces North American movie theaters this week with an English dub, most families who venture out to give it a try likely won't know that it's the most successful film of 2025. As venerable as the source material may be, Jiao Zi has crafted a timeless, relatable antihero and expands upon the original film both visually and conceptually—though his film will leave audiences emotionally underwhelmed. However, their spirits were protected by Ne Zha's master, Taiyi Zhenren (Rick Zieff), who uses a Sacred Lotus to regenerate their bodies so they can return to the mortal coil and help fight against a new attack on their home of Chentang Pass. Seeking vengeance, he commands Master Shen Gongbao (Daniel Riordan) to unleash demons and dragons upon the people of the Pass—which includes his son, whose new body falls apart under his extreme exertion in battle. A truce is then made: Ne Zha will share his body with the spirit of Bing for a week, where they'll complete three heavenly trials that will essentially allow them to power up the spent Sacred Lotus, rebuild Bing's body once more, and (eventually) achieve immortality. While Ne Zha 2 doesn't turn into an animated version of Steve Martin's All Of Me, the funny comes from feral demon Ne Zha hosting the more balanced spirit of Bing within him, which makes them an all-the-more formidable team. For all of the complexities and twists inherent to their quest (and boy, it gets dense), there's always a fart or barf joke waiting in the wings to bridge any cultural divides. Gravitas is the point, with some atonal sidebars that get corny or break tension using buffonish characters. In that litany of embarrassing setups he's made to overcome, Jiao Zi re-frames the poor demon kid as vulnerable and resilient—anything but the enemy. His journey is not only intended to solve the Bing body problem, but to let the world see him as his friend and parents do. By the time Ne Zha and Ao Bing master the trials and meet Immortal Wuliang (Will Utay) in his heavenly compound surrounded by omnipotent Demon Hunters, there's already been enough story and worldbuilding for two films, yet there's a lot more to go before its 144 minutes are through. Despite being a Chinese production, Ne Zha 2 suffers from the worst Hollywood trope: blockbuster bloat. The sheer scale that Jiao Zi and his animation co-directors Ge Yi and Hao Shan strive towards, is beyond anything Western CG animation has yet delivered. Every frame contains a kaleidoscope of details so mind-boggling at times in its depth and breadth that one wonders how long it took to create such density without blowing out a power grid. But with that indulgence comes a lack of restraint. Its boundlessly creative visuals, rich character design, all-enveloping sound, and imaginative scenarios are truly original. But that sensory onslaught—those endless fights with their own progressive stakes—comes at the expense of focus, character, and story.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carey, who famously doesn't believe in the construct of age – but who is 56 for those of us who do – will become the oldest recipient of the award to date, surpassing Richard Lester, director of The Beatles‘ films A Hard Day's Night and Help!. (In a way, it's more impressive that Carey is receiving the award 35 years into her career than if she had gotten it when she was in her first flush of stardom. It should also be noted that the recipients of the Video Vanguard Award have been moving up in age in recent years. Jennifer Lopez, Missy Elliott and Shakira were all past 45 when they received the honor. Carey will be the eighth consecutive recipient of the award who is a woman, following Rihanna (2016), Pink (2017), Lopez (2018), Elliott (2019), Nicki Minaj (2022), Shakira (2023) and Katy Perry (2024). In 2005, she performed two smash hits – “We Belong Together” and “Shake It Off” – in a segment that also featured Jadakiss and Jermaine Dupri. Carey presented the Vanguard Award to LL COOL J in 1997. Coincidentally, the rapper and actor is hosting this year's VMAs, which will air from UBS Arena in New York. Carey made her VMAs debut in 1991 with a performance of “Emotions.” In 1998, Carey and Whitney Houston opened the show in an iconic pop culture moment when the two “accidentally” wore the same dress. Carey and Jackson were both signed to Sony Music labels throughout the 1990s. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, from “Vision of Love” in June 1990 to “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” which logged its most recent appearance at No. Carey was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2022. She has been nominated for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in each of the last two years, but has yet to receive that accolade. Such contemporaries as Houston, Janet Jackson and George Michael, who likewise weren't rock & roll in the traditional sense, have been admitted into the Hall,  so Carey is likely to make it too eventually. She has won five Grammys, including vocal performance honors in both pop and R&B. If she wins, it will (amazingly) be her first VMA won in competition. In his annual forecast of who might get this year's Video Vanguard award, Billboard's Andrew Unterberger pegged Carey as this year's third-likeliest recipient (behind his top pick Miley Cyrus and runner-up pick Ed Sheeran). Unterberger wasn't working from a finite list of nominees. Theoretically anyone could receive the honor, making it impressive that he came so close. Forget that: Mariah Carey has still never won a single Video Music Award, getting shut out to date in eight career nominations stretching back to 1996. She's up for a ninth in September, with ‘Type Dangerous' nominated for best R&B video, but MTV could really make this wrong right by giving Mimi the Video Vanguard for her decades-spanning career as a music video superstar. She'd be on the veteran side for the award at this point, but that didn't stop MTV from honoring Shakira two years ago, so perhaps there's still a chance for MC after all — and given the release of new album Here for It All later this September, now would be the time.” Alex Warren, Busta Rhymes, J Balvin featuring DJ Snake, Ricky Martin and sombr are also set to perform. Martin will be honored with the inaugural Latin Icon Award. Lady Gaga leads the nominations for the 2025 MTV Video Music Awards with 12 nods, followed closely by her “Die With a Smile” duet partner Bruno Mars, who has 11 nods. The 2025 MTV VMAs are executive produced by Bruce Gillmer, Den of Thieves co-founder Jesse Ignjatovic, and Barb Bialkowski. Jackie Barba is executive in charge of production. Wendy Plaut is executive in charge of celebrity talent. Lisa Lauricella is executive in charge of music talent. This marks Toffler's return to the show following a decadelong absence.

He laments the Janet Jackson Super Bowl halftime show and being refused Freedom Fries. He's a superfan of the Black Eyed Peas and “Buffy, the Vampire Slayer.” And, when it comes to watching his precious episodes of “Buffy,” they are (well, at least, they were) all stored on his TiVo which was, crucially, not connected to the internet so the episodes wouldn't expire. The early aughts was a strange, but also exciting time when it came to consuming media. There were no streaming services — even watching a movie trailer online, something we take entirely for granted today, could take hours to download if it was something popular like, say, the “Attack of the Clones” trailer.

Avildsen ‘Anemone' Trailer: Daniel Day-Lewis Returns to the Big Screen in His Son's Directorial Debut Finally, films could be viewed in their proper aspect ratios without the need for bulky laserdisc players that required multiple discs and flipping those multiple discs while viewing. Finally, a whole world of bonus features and commentary tracks were available to the masses, presented in a quality that was, frankly, good enough for the cathode-ray televisions of the era that most people still had. I like to think that Frank Drebin Jr. has a whole closet filled with DVDs of “Dante's Peak” and “Six Days, Seven Nights.” But one that he almost definitely does not have is the Criterion DVD release of “Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom.” Many of innovations that have already been referenced — proper aspect ratios and commentary tracks — were developed in the 1980s by Criterion. Criterion entered the DVD market in 1998 with its release of “Seven Samurai.” (The “Grand Illusion” disc that Criterion intended to be its first release was delayed due to restoration work.) This is, obviously, a very controversial film and, thankfully, it is not my job to get into any of the themes of the film itself, which has been explored at length for your entertainment on this very website. I'm no lawyer, but some of the characters' actions might be considered “crimes.”) And, yes, she remembers when “Salò” became an inductee into The Criterion Collection on LaserDisc. “Generally, my partners Bill Becker and Jonathan Turell pitched the films,” Stein told IndieWire. “I didn't have that much of an opinion if something belongs in The Criterion Collection or not. As it turns out, “Salò” was one of the films she had an opinion on. “I thought ‘Walkabout,' for example, should be in the collection, and they decided that I was right and put it in there. ‘Salò,' I thought, should not be in there because it was such a disgusting movie,” she said. ‘Ghostbusters,' for example, I thought was an iconic comedy and should really should be in there and they agreed with me.” (For those who did not know, yes, “Ghostbusters” was released as a Criterion LaserDisc in 1989.) Stein explained her partners' reasoning: “They were also the owners of Janus Films and they tended to put anything that was in Janus into The Criterion Collection. For collectors who just had to have every Criterion spine number, missing #17 was kind of a big deal. So, around the time DVD players became more affordable — and when most collectors would be starting to put a Criterion DVD collection together — it was near-impossible to get The Criterion Collection #17. When I reached out to The Criterion Collection to get some basic information about why the DVD had gone out of print, I was told they would not be participating. I did speak to a number of people who had knowledge of the situation, however, and I was told it was mostly a rights issue — hardly the sort of mundane answer befitting such a wild film. It's frustratingly difficult to find eBay sale history, especially for auctions that ended two decades ago, but I did find some old message board entries from the era discussing the pretty insane prices for “Salò,” a movie most people don't even enjoy watching. (Though it's unclear if this disc actually sold for that price.) One solution offered was to buy a Region 2 disc of the film, but, back then that also involved buying a Region 2 DVD player. (If you buy a 4K disc today, it will play on any player. A user named Veli-Matti Reitti wrote, “Since the criterion version of this masterpiece is almost impossible to find anymore except through ebay where you'll be forced to pay ridiculous amounts for it if you somehow manage to land the winning bid. He's offered some advice on obtaining a region two DVD, but Paul_D can't figure out what all the fuss is about, “Could someone explain what all the fuss is about with this film? I've done multiple searches all over the place and I can't come up with a satisfying explanation as to why this is so controversial. I know it has risque content, but its reputation is unprecedented. Here's one from 2003 warning of the Criterion bootlegs of “Salò” that flooded the market, and notes on how to avoid buying one. A user named Seb seemed confused that the notoriously high-priced “Salò” is only $50 on eBay, and was worried he's not buying the real deal, followed by some very intense gratitude for any answers: “Is EVERYONE selling bootlegs? What is going on, and WHERE can I find my LEGIT copy? As a user named Jeff pointed out to Seb that, he was, indeed, looking at bootlegs. While they look pretty close on the cover, a couple of dead giveaways are: Chapter stops: should be 29, not 6 or 9. Here's one from 2006 warning owners to sell their copies now because Criterion would be selling the disc again, which eventually did happen. Great news for PaulP, he's correct, those two titles are also available on Criterion's website. What's funny about the brand-new Blu-ray Criterion disc that you can buy right now for $31.96 (or less if you wait for a sale), is that this specific DVD of “Salò” from 1998 still goes for around $50 on eBay. My only hope, if we are all blessed enough to get another “Naked Gun” movie, is that Frank Drebin Jr. adds the secondary market cost of the Criterion DVD of “Salò” to his extensive list of 25-year-old pop culture grievances. IndieWire's '70s Week is presented by Bleecker Street's “RELAY.” Riz Ahmed plays a world class “fixer” who specializes in brokering lucrative payoffs between corrupt corporations and the individuals who threaten their ruin. IndieWire calls “RELAY” “sharp, fun, and smartly entertaining from its first scene to its final twist, ‘RELAY' is a modern paranoid thriller that harkens back to the genre's '70s heyday.” From director David Mackenzie (“Hell or High Water”) and also starring Lily James, in theaters August 22.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brent Hinds, the co-founder of Grammy-winning heavy metal group Mastodon who played with the group for 25 years before his departure earlier this year, died on Wednesday. Brian Jost Reents, Deputy Chief Medical Examiner Investigator of the of the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office, confirmed Hinds' death to Rolling Stone. According to local news outlet Atlanta News First, Hinds was killed in a motorcycle accident in Atlanta when his Harley Davidson collided with a SUV. Hinds co-founded the Grammy-winning group in 2000 with bassist Troy Sanders, guitarist Bill Kelliher, and drummer Brann Dailor. “We are in a state of unfathomable sadness and grief,” the band wrote on social media. We are heartbroken, shocked, and still trying to process the loss of this creative force with whom we've shared so many triumphs, milestones, and the creation of music that has touched the hearts of so many. Our hearts are with Brent's family, friends, and fans. The lineup of Hinds, Sanders, Dailor, and Kelliher recorded eight studio albums together over the past 25 years, including their 2002 debut Remission, 2009 mainstream breakthrough Crack the Skye, and their most recent LP, 2021's Hushed and Grim. Leviathan, the band's critically acclaimed 2004 album, was named one of Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time, with single “Blood and Thunder” earning a spot on the 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Songs of All Time. “We were on a quest for something that might not even be there, and we were sacrificing a lot by leaving our families and friends behind. “Deeper tracks like the fully unhinged ‘Megalodon' and the slow-building opus ‘Hearts Alive' only drag us deeper into Mastodon's dark sound and vision.” Kid Rock Obviously Took Gavin Newsom's Fake Endorsement Bait Fake Armies of the Night: Trump Unleashes Show and Awe on Washington Al Jardine Is Keeping the Beach Boys' Legacy Alive, One Show at a Time Last September, Mastodon and Lamb of God teamed up for the new single “Floods of Triton,” which would end up being Hinds' last recording with the group.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brent Hinds, the former lead guitarist and co-vocalist of Mastodon, died in a motorcycle crash in Atlanta Wednesday night (August 21), local news outlets report. William Brent Hinds grew up in Birmingham, Alabama, where he learned the banjo as a teenager and picked up the fret-tapping technique he would later bring to bear on the electric guitar. “I was very dysfunctional at school, just a jackass. I'd take LSD and come to class still tripping. He moved to Atlanta in the mid 1990s, where he met future Mastodon bandmate Troy Sanders and joined his band Four Hour Fogger. Their 2002 debut album, Remission, on which Hinds and Sanders traded lead vocals and songwriting duties over virtuosic, hardcore-infused metal, caused a sensation in heavy music circles. The studio follow-up, 2007's Blood Mountain, earned them a Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance. Their final studio albums with Hinds were 2014's relatively radio-friendly Once More 'Round the Sun, the course-correcting Emperor of Sand in 2017 (which won their first Grammy, for Best Metal Performance), and the 2021 double-album Hushed and Grim. Hinds' unceremonious departure from the band was revealed this year. Though the band's own announcement was cordial, Hinds later said he was “kicked out” and called his former bandmates “horrible humans” in Instagram comments. He continued to perform live around Atlanta in bands such as Fiend Without a Face, West End Motel, and Dirty B & the Boys. Soon after the news broke, Mastodon wrote a tribute to their former bandmate on social media: We are heartbroken, shocked, and still trying to process the loss of this creative force with whom we've shared so many triumphs, milestones, and the creation of music that has touched the hearts of so many.

Coming off a roaring premiere at Sundance, Alex Russell celebrated the Los Angeles premiere of his directorial debut “Lurker” on Wednesday, August 20, just a couple days before the whirlwind thriller releases in theaters. Russell, who comes from the TV world as a writer and producer on “The Bear,” as well as a producer on “Beef,” says he had a lot to learn coming over to the film side. Related Stories Bruce LaBruce on the Double Pornography of ‘Saló' ‘Arco' Teaser: Will Ferrell, Natalie Portman, and More Lead English Dub Cast of French Sci-Fi Animated Fable You don't know if anyone cares about this movie or if it's terrible, and then maybe you'll leave with distribution.” MUBI ended up purchasing the film out of the festival in a reported mid-seven-figure deal. The film features original music, produced with help from the likes of Kenny Beats, Dijon, and Rex Orange County. Though the latter was rumored to be an inspiration for the film's chart-topper, Russell prefers to keep any direct real-life inspiration mysterious. “It's anyone you think that would be on the playlist.” “We really had to beat the allegations of this being about one person in particular, because that would have, I think, really shrunk the scope of it all. The more we worked on it with Archie, the more it just became well disguised, like an amalgam of all these different artists. In the script he was [originally] written as an American.” However, they never met while filming that project. “We didn't, I'm there for one second,” Pellerin joked. Both actors jumped at the chance to work with Russell, praising the joys of being able to work with a first-time director. He was never making us feel like we had to achieve one thing in particular. I know it kind of is a trope, a little bit, for actors to talk about freedom in acting, but it's really true that he was directing us in a way that felt like, ‘Now try this and now try that.' I think it was testament to how great of a writer he is, because I think he was rewriting the scenes as new elements [evolved], which is the reality of fiction coming into play, and I just loved it.” “The biggest lesson I've learned from Alex is that you really have to go into something trusting your filmmaker, trusting your director,” Madekwe recalled. Zack Fox, long-time friend of Russell, plays Swett, a close friend in Oliver's entourage who often makes fun of Matthew. “The way he brought me into it was just like, ‘Hey, I'm writing this movie about the past 10 years of my life, in and around music and entertainment people, and I have this character that I think you would be perfect to play.' And he was just like, ‘No, but I trust you as an actor to bring this forth, because I had seen some of the real-life references.” Earlier this year, Fox made a cameo in Doechii's music video for “Denial Is a River” as “the old dude from 2019.” “It was 100% made possible by Cam Hicks and Justin Grant, AKA Sushiboy Mexico, they brought me into the fold. My job as an actor is just to pull up and shoot the ball where you tell me to shoot it, so hopefully I knocked it out of the park.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pop star Meghan Trainor is no longer “All About That Bass,” happily showcasing her fit physique and impressive strength in a new social media video on August 21, 2025. But many fans say Trainor, a season 22 advisor on “American Idol” who was very vocal about wanting to be the show's next judge after Katy Perry's departure, is nearly unrecognizable in her new post. In March, Trainor opened up about her weight loss journey, which has included “huge lifestyle changes,” from intense workouts to using the weight loss tool Mounjaro, telling People, “I have never been more comfortable in my body.” One fan noted that Trainor looked more like Ariana Grande than herself, and another complained, “You are starting to look like everything you were once singing against. But Trainor was deluged with compliments, too, including one that said, “MOTHERRRRR YOU LOOK GORGEOUS 🥹🔥” Someone else deemed Trainor the “prettiest girl on planet,” while another fan declared, “mama you look AMAZING 😍😍” The comments from fans won't likely faze Trainor, who's been an open book about the tools she's used to change her look in ways that boost her confidence. Trainor, who shares two young sons with her husband Daryl Sabara, wrote after being honored at Billboard's Women in Music event, that “it's a little disheartening that so many of the questions (and comments) were focused on my body instead of my music, my passion, or the decade of hard work that got me here. This is what it's like to be a woman in the music industry.” Trainor went on to say, “I've worked with a dietician, made huge lifestyle changes, started exercising with a trainer, and yes, I used science and support (shoutout to Mounjaro!) “Here's to celebrating talent, growth, and the power of putting yourself first,” she concluded.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stephanie Shojaee has fans talking — and not in the way she probably hoped. The speculation comes amid Stephanie's ongoing feud with Alexia Nepola, 58, which has fueled plenty of drama this season. But according to fans online, her latest social media activity may hint at more than just shade. On Reddit, fans began dissecting Stephanie's posts after screenshots made the rounds. Others quickly jumped in, with some convinced that the messages meant Stephanie was walking away, while others suspected the posts were just part of a Bravo-worthy stunt. Another added, “I could see her ‘quit' before not getting asked back. If the reunion went bad she may be trying to save face.” “Noooo I love to hate her she makes me laugh and drives Alexia insane,” joked another fan. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight last month, Stephanie admitted that her first season wasn't all glitz and glamour. No joke,” she said, calling the experience “a rollercoaster” despite also being “so much fun.” Weeks later, when asked directly on Instagram if she would appear in season 8, Stephanie dodged the question. She previously dated Anthony Lopez, the longtime partner of RHOM alum Nicole Martin, nearly 20 years ago. While the history raised eyebrows, Stephanie insisted to Entertainment Weekly that it was no big deal. Let us know what you think in the comments below.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After knighting Jack O'Connell as a leading man of unique intensity in the prison drama Starred Up, Mackenzie's projects have shown an interest in reflecting the fraught construction of modern America through unambiguous genre stories. But where Hell or High Water was finely engineered, a void of personality makes Relay simply mechanical. Relay stars Riz Ahmed as Ash, a broker who anonymously protects vulnerable people who possess incriminating evidence of corporate malfeasance and secures big payoffs from companies eager to keep their crimes from public view. Throughout the film, different relay service employees blankly read off Ash's messages to his new client, Sarah Grant (Lily James), who stole a damning report from her biotech company. Crucially, Ash's clients have no whistleblower ambitions—they employ him to make the heat go away, preferably with a chunk of cash, without making front-page news or being summoned to high-profile depositions. Piasecki's screenplay finds many blind spots of public service—not just relay services, but also TSA and the post office—that Ash uses to delay the henchmen from crushing his operation, and Mackenzie engineers extended bouts of tension from asset drops and stakeouts as Ash's control starts to waver. In airport lounges, twilight New York streets, and busy tourist spots, Sarah is watched by voyeurs who are also trying to spot each other, but while Ahmed's tense, still expressions effectively channel Relay's wired, weary tone (it's tiring being so paranoid all the time), Relay finds no emotional heft in its ensemble, filling out its characters with weightless shorthand and undermining itself with a late-game twist that betrays any investment in the thriller's David-vs.-Goliath angle. An AA meeting monologue as character psychology exposition is Grade A hackwork—a handwavey dramatic choice that signals transformation and atonement without proving either. As the film veers towards a climax that mirrors the shootout ending of Kiyoshi Kurosawa's recent Cloud but with none of that film's humorous perversion, Relay loses its edge. The film's playful use of communication systems and powerless characters betrays its political indifference to political insight; it is a series of dramatic games linked together with the occasional, unconvincing assurance that there are real people inside these grinding thriller gears. Mackenzie's robust Hell Or High Water fused its thematic concerns cleanly and ably with its thriller mechanics; Relay attempts the same gambit, but lacks Sheridan's blunt, eccentric personalities to help cover the seams. Rather than discovering anything novel or liberating about the hostile, modern battleground of America, Relay‘s compelling set-up becomes overly dependent on typical rug-pulls and action beats.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Movies and TV series will be suggested based on the zodiac in the company's latest move to give their homepage a playful edge on rivals. The streamer isn't flirting (not yet, at least) but is launching a new hub within its platform devoted to astrology. 'Hostage' Review: Julie Delpy and Suranne Jones Deserve Better Than Netflix's Generic Political Thriller “At Netflix, our team of curators on the member experience team create these themed collections to help members discover something fresh, fun and timely,” the streamer said in a statement. Some of the sign characteristics are less flattering than others. In case you're wondering, no, Netflix doesn't know what your birthday is, and, no, you don't need to tell the streamer your star sign in order to use the hub. Astrology has seemingly been making a popularity comeback of late, with Gen Z reportedly getting into horoscopes amid a surge of TikTokers and apps professing to read the stars. Netflix has been getting more clever and topical with its hubs lately (as have other streamers), recently launching collections like “Hope They Don't End Up on the Kiss Cam” filled with steamy dramas in the wake of the Coldplay concert incident, and “Can I Pull You for a Chat?” inspired by the summer's Love Island craze (even though the show is on rival Peacock).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The latest chapter in the saga of White vs. White House came earlier this week when the White Stripes rocker insulted Trump's redecoration of the Oval Office, saying that it now looks like “a vulgar, gold leafed and gaudy, professional wrestler's dressing room.” The barb elicited a response from Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, who told The Daily Beast that White is “a washed up, has-been loser posting drivel on social media because he clearly has ample time on his hands due to his stalled career.” Cheung further defended his boss' aesthetic choices, telling the outlet: “It's apparent he's been masquerading as a real artist, because he fails to appreciate, and quite frankly disrespects, the splendor and significance of the Oval Office inside of ‘The People's House. The war of words continued yesterday (August 20), with White sharing a lengthy statement against Trump and his administration on Instagram. White criticized Trump's “blatant fascist manipulation of government, his gestapo ICE tactics, his racist remarks about Latinos, Native Americans, etc. his ridiculous ‘wall' construction, his attacks on the disabled, his attempted coup and mob insurrection and destruction of the sacred halls of congress,” and plenty more. Several artists—including Margo Price and Michigander's Jason Singer—have supported White in the comments on his post. “You hit a fuckin' nerve ‘cuz they don't put out statements this length for earthquakes and shootings,” Patton Oswalt wrote. “Keep going.” Cat Power's Chan Marshall added, “LOVE YOU JACK❤️‍🔥.” Pitchfork may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.
