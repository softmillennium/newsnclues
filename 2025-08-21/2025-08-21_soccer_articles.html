Five short weeks after winning the Club World Cup at MetLife Stadium, Chelsea returned to competitive play at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, banners celebrating their latest championship adorned around their stadium. The Blues, though, swapped an impressive 3-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain last month for a sluggish 0-0 draw against Crystal Palace, the scoreline a perfect reflection of the performance. External factors likely played a sizable role in Chelsea's underwhelming showing on Sunday, the Club World Cup creating wonky preseason schedules for the European teams that made deep runs. Enzo Maresca's side, for example, played an 11-month season, took three weeks off, and had just 13 days of preseason preparation before facing Palace on Sunday, while the opponent had a much more traditional build-up. Maresca did not feel his side were underprepared as a result, but it was hard to ignore the circumstances. For sure, [Palace] have already played seven, eight games. So the real game for us was today. Even then, Chelsea have room for improvement as they prepare to face West Ham United on Friday, a trip to the London Stadium offering a perfect opportunity to put Sunday's performance in the past. West Ham are coming off a 3-0 loss to newly-promoted Sunderland, which could be the first sign of a troubling season ahead for a team that has not refreshed much this summer and poses a limited attacking threat. Chelsea were clearly the more dominant attacking team on Sunday, when they outshot Palace 19 to 11 and generated almost a full expected goal more than the Eagles. It was a performance that was more about quantity than quality, though – the Blues took just three shots on goal, unideal no matter the preseason disruptions. It offered a stark reminder that despite the Club World Cup triumph and the UEFA Europa Conference League win before that, Maresca's Chelsea may have plenty of potential but are still a great unknown. Maresca boasts a bloated squad jam-packed with attackers, but has yet to figure out what his preferred combination is yet. Considering the circumstances – specifically, an ownership group that is unusually eager to sign new players – it is understandable that the manager has not cracked the code just yet. The journey to figure out Chelsea's first-choice attacking unit has been a constant feature of Maresca's tenure at the club but the Club World Cup run offers important context thanks to the introduction of a batch of new players. He joined the team midway through the tournament and notched three goals in three games, including one in the final, and translated that into a start on Sunday against Palace. Joao Pedro was at the top of a 4-2-3-1 that included Palmer, as well as Pedro Neto and Jamie Gittens on the wings, but the returns were not spectacular. Joao Pedro took just two shots in 73 minutes, a throwback to his average returns during his two years with Brighton and Hove Albion. The less-than-exciting outing for Chelsea, though, perhaps opens the door for Delap to earn a starting role while 18-year-old Estevao Willian may play a sizable role himself this season after making a 36-minute cameo on Sunday. Friday's match at West Ham, then, feels like the unofficial start of auditions to be one of Chelsea's first-choice attackers, all of whom will be tasked with helping the Blues live up to the hype they created last season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>COMMERCE CITY, Colo. — The Colorado Rapids announced today that the club has signed U.S. Men's National Team midfielder Paxten Aaronson from Germany's Eintracht Frankfurt to a five-year contract through 2030. “Bringing Paxten to Colorado highlights our ambition and belief in his ability to impact our team immediately,” said Colorado Rapids President Pádraig Smith. “He has proven himself in Europe, gained valuable experience on the international stage with the U.S. Men's National Team, and brings a dynamic, creative presence to our midfield. He is the exact type of young, hungry player we want to build around at this club, and we are delighted to welcome him to Colorado as we strengthen a team capable of competing at the highest level.” Aaronson, 21, most recently spent the 2024–25 season on loan at FC Utrecht in the Netherlands' Eredivisie, where he recorded nine goals and six assists in 37 league appearances. He previously spent the second half of the 2023–24 season on loan with Dutch Eredivisie side Vitesse, scoring four goals in 14 appearances. In 2023, he joined Eintracht Frankfurt from the Philadelphia Union and made his Bundesliga debut in March of that year against Union Berlin, going on to make 23 appearances for the club while scoring one goal and providing three assists. The Medford, New Jersey, native began his professional career with the Philadelphia Union after signing a Homegrown Player contract in August 2020. He also featured for Philadelphia Union II, making 24 appearances, scoring six goals and delivering five assists. He also featured for the U-23s with three appearances and one goal. His standout performances earned him a nomination as a finalist for the 2022 Chipotle U.S. Soccer Young Male Player of the Year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Terms such as “pioneer” and “trailblazer” often are mentioned too loosely in sports, but with an athlete like Loradana Paletta, it's difficult to argue those descriptors. This summer, Paletta, a midfielder, played on the United States U-17 Women's National Team in the 4 Nations Tournament in Mexico City, competing against Canada, Mexico and Costa Rica. Before leaving for Mexico City, Paletta became one of the youngest athletes in American sports history to sign a Name, Image and Likeness deal. All this before her first day of attending Syosset High School, which is September 2. I never really thought it was going to happen,” Paletta said. Paletta has decided not to play soccer for Syosset High School this year. Her lofty goals  include playing  professionally for a major club in Europe and winning Olympic gold medals and World Cups for Team USA. “It's definitely going to take a lot of work,” Paletta said. Chris Wingert, who was born in Babylon and attended St. John the Baptist High School before playing 14 seasons in the MLS, became a FIFA-licensed soccer agent after his playing career. Wingert, who represents professional athletes, later took on Paletta and represented her in the deal with Lotto. “I saw her play with NYCFC boys and I thought she was a boy with long hair,” Wingert recalls of seeing Paletta play a few years ago. As a former top men's soccer player, Wingert was shocked to hear Paletta was able to excel against the boys as a teenager. But after seeing her play, he understood how she does it. Wingert was impressed with her quickness, technique and tactical skill, but another aspect garnered his attention the most. “It's completely unique to anything I've ever seen before … I truly think in 10 years from now if we're talking about her as one of the best players in the world, it's going to be her mentality.” Paletta hopes to make the U-17 Women's World Cup roster. “It felt intimidating, but at the same time, I know being called up three years that they are going to be bigger and stronger,” Paletta said. A lot of those lessons come from playing with the boys. “It's their time with growth spurts, so they are definitely going to be bigger and taller than me and more physical,” Paletta said. Wingert said Paletta had offers from multiple companies to sign an NIL deal this summer, but they felt Lotto would give her a chance to be a featured athlete. Wingert didn't disclose any financial arrangements between Paletta and Lotto, but Paletta is eligible to receive financial payment without losing collegiate or high school eligibility. The New York State Public High School Athletic Association (NYSPHSAA) permits NIL deals while allowing student-athletes to retain amateur status and eligibility, as long as the endorsement deal isn't affiliated or showcased with their school, section or NYSPHSAA. Paletta's NIL deal does not conflict with the NYSPHSAA Amateur Rule since she did not receive her NIL through Syosset High School or any county or state means. “I love rocking their gear, they really make me feel comfortable,” Paletta said. “It's really mind-blowing,” Paletta said, “but I've worked hard to be in this position.” And Wingert wouldn't doubt any of Paletta's goals, or her potential impact on U.S. women's soccer. “I don't think there's anything outside the realm of what's realistic for her,” Wingert said. “Her ability and where she's at right now is truly different from anything I've seen. And I think U.S. Soccer, the way they've handled things, I think would tell you she's absolutely an outlier and they see the potential for some groundbreaking stuff to happen.” Owen O'Brien covers high school and college sports for Newsday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since turning pro in 2020, Paxten Aaronson has been one of the more intriguing prospects in the USMNT player pool. After breaking through with the Philadelphia Union, Aaronson started gaining the attention of clubs in Europe and ultimately moved to Eintracht Frankfurt in 2023. The German club elected to loan out Aaronson and he's played for Vitesse and Utrecht in Holland. He had been the subject of further loan rumors in Europe, but it appears his next stop will be back in the United States. According to reports, Aaronson is set to join the Colorado Rapids on an $8 million transfer fee so he can be closer to family and have stability. Aaronson is just 21 years-old and the move will make him a central part of Colorado's lineup. Currently, the team is sitting in 7th place in the Western Conference and is looking for a boost to push for a playoff spot. The Rapids have 36 goals on the season, ranking 8th out of 15 clubs in the conference, and a creative and versatile attacker brings a greater goal threat as they compete for a post-season run. Apparently there are mountains in Colorado The dual-national midfielder has a big opportunity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Cincinnati, Miami & Seattle Right Back Added to 2025 RSL Roster Ahead of Saturday's Minnesota Match; Two-Time U.S. World Cup Defender Also Played in Europe w/ Tottenham, Sunderland, Newcastle, Galatasaray Yedlin will immediately be added to RSL's 2025 roster, the 32-year-old U.S. Men's National Team star training with Head Coach Pablo Mastroeni's side Thursday and Friday, eligible to compete in this weekend's Claret-and-Cobalt match at home against Minnesota United FC (7:30p MT, America First Field / www.RSL.com/tickets). “RSL is an historic club in MLS, with an amazing reputation around the League,” said Yedlin from the airport on Wednesday night, prior to his arrival at Salt Lake City International Airport. I've known Kurt Schmid since my Seattle days, (Director of Recruitment) Jon Spencer is a family friend. Pablo Mastroeni's reputation is excellent with his track record of success on and off the pitch. It was exciting to hear of their interest in me becoming part of the setup at RSL, and something my family and I needed to explore.” A veteran of 218 career MLS matches with Seattle (2013/14), Inter Miami (2022-24) and Cincinnati (2024/25), Yedlin has scored four career goals in the North American top-flight from his right back position. The three-time MLS All-Star (2013, 2014, 2022) also served as club Captain for Inter Miami's 2023 Leagues Cup championship team, ceding the honor to Lionel Messi upon his late-season arrival. As a second-year professional, Yedlin also raised the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup with Seattle in 2014. Yedlin also scored four times while playing 187 games of European football from early 2015 to January 2022. Yedlin continues: “From one homegrown to another, it has been great to see how Justen Glad has done there, building a career at his boyhood club; Diego Luna is a guy who has blown up on the scene by being anextremely hard worker and willingness to work on both sides of the ball; when your attacking guys and technically proficient players buy in, as Diego has, with some grit and a chip on his shoulder, it inspires the whole group to do the defensive work and never stop fighting.” My wife is from The Bronx, and she cannot wait.” Born on July 9, 1993 as DeAndre Roselle Yedlin in Seattle, Wash., becoming Seattle Sounders FC's first-ever homegrown signing, returning to his hometown after attending the University of Akron for two seasons(2011/12). “We are absolutely thrilled to welcome DeAndre to our club,” said RSL Chief Soccer Officer  Kurt Schmid, whose team boasts five of the remaining eight reg. We believe DeAndre's impact will be felt immediately, and we're excited about the role he will play in driving our success now and into the future. 2 for RSL this season, joins nine other RSL players to own FIFA World Cup appearances on their career resume, with Eddie Pope (2006), Robbie Findley (2010), Nick Rimando (2014) and Kyle Beckerman (2014) also representing the United States. Pope, Findley, Rimando, Beckerman and Oviedo each participated in the quadrennial event while an active member of RSL. Only eight players in Real Salt Lake history have played more games in Europe than Yedlin – Alfredo Ortuño (511), Nedum Onuoha (354), fellow 2025 addition Johnny Russell (334), Damir Kreilach (277), Giuseppe Rossi (268), Bobby Wood (230), new teammate Diogo Gonçalves (220) and Everton Luiz (204). Real Salt Lake (9-13-4, 31 points, 10th West / 20th Shield) returns this week to America First Field in Sandy with Saturday's 7:30p MT Major League Soccer regular-season match against Minnesota United FC (13-6-8, 47 points, 2nd West / 6thShield). Saturday's contest is available via Apple TV+ / MLS Season Pass, with Max Bretos and Brian Dunseth (ENG) on the call, as are Jorge Perez-Navarro and Marcelo Balboa (SPN). RSL returns home to play five of its next six contests on Utah soil from Saturday through early October, before ending the 2025 reg. RSL returns home – where it boasts five wins and two draws against just one loss since June 1 – looking to rebound from a pair of chaotic and controversial one-goal losses each of the last two weekends away at Charlotte FC and New York Red Bulls. This weekend's Minnesota United FC visit is a rematch of last year's MLS Cup Playoff First-Round series. A year ago, RSL amassed a 12-3-4 (W-L-T) record at home, where the Club has traditionally enjoyed a fortress-like record of success, winning nearly 70% of games and averaging just under two points per game in parts of 17 seasons across all competitions in Sandy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why ‘Chelsea's Trophy' is in the US President's Office Football fans pride themselves on spotting details others may miss. So when the White House shared a photograph this week of President Donald Trump meeting with world leaders in the Oval Office, eagle-eyed supporters quickly noticed something unusual. Among the flags, portraits, and presidential papers stood a glittering piece of silverware: the FIFA Club World Cup trophy. Why was a trophy Chelsea won just weeks ago at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium sitting in the most powerful office in the world? Or had Chelsea forgotten to pick it up? The curiosity quickly went viral, sparking a mix of amusement, outrage, and intrigue among Chelsea supporters and neutrals alike. President Trump himself explained the situation in an interview with DAZN. “I said, ‘When are you going to pick up the trophy? “They said, ‘We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office, we're making a new one.' So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval right now.” His words suggested that Chelsea might have been left without their hard-won prize. But FIFA was quick to set the record straight. In reality, there are three versions of the Club World Cup trophy, each with its own story and home: For one, it reflects the United States' growing role in world football. Keeping a version of the trophy in the Oval Office signals not only appreciation for hosting duties but also recognition of football's expanding influence in U.S. culture. For years, the sport trailed behind American football, basketball, and baseball. But with the influx of international stars in Major League Soccer and high-profile tournaments held on U.S. soil, the game's profile has never been higher. Politically, the trophy also serves as a prop for Trump, whose image often thrives on spectacle and symbolism. Displaying global football's silverware on his desk presents the United States as not just a political superpower but a sporting one too. Chelsea fans, unsurprisingly, reacted with a mix of pride and frustration. Social media brimmed with memes and jokes, with one fan tweeting: “We waited all season for this, and Trump just nicked it for decoration!” Another quipped: “So Chelsea win the Club World Cup and somehow Trump wins the trophy—sounds about right.” But FIFA's clarification that Chelsea owns its replica helped ease concerns. For Chelsea, the 2025 Club World Cup win will always belong to them, regardless of where other versions of the trophy reside. With major tournaments lined up and growing fan interest, the country is poised to play an even larger role in shaping the sport's future. The Oval Office trophy tale may have started as a quirky observation by football fans, but it quickly revealed deeper layers about sport, symbolism, and global influence. Would you like me to keep the final thoughts short and punchy (almost like a takeaway line for readers), or slightly longer and reflective, tying back to Chelsea's win as well? Chelsea fans need not worry—their hard-earned Club World Cup trophy is safe in London. Ultimately, the image of the trophy in the president's office serves as a reminder of football's growing influence in America and its ability to connect politics, culture, and sport in surprising ways. In the end, “Chelsea's trophy” may not belong to Donald Trump—but it does tell a bigger story about where the beautiful game is headed. Meta Description: Football fans were surprised to see Chelsea's Club World Cup trophy in the Oval Office. Here's why a version of the silverware sits with the US president, and what it means for football's global future. Why ‘Chelsea's Trophy' is in the US President's Office Football fans pride themselves on spotting details others may miss. So when the White House shared a photograph this week of President Donald Trump meeting with world leaders in the Oval Office, eagle-eyed supporters quickly noticed something unusual. Among the flags, portraits, and presidential papers stood a glittering piece of silverware: the FIFA Club World Cup trophy. Why was a trophy Chelsea won just weeks ago at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium sitting in the most powerful office in the world? Or had Chelsea forgotten to pick it up?

President Trump himself explained the situation in an interview with DAZN. “I said, ‘When are you going to pick up the trophy? “They said, ‘We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office, we're making a new one.' So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval right now.” His words suggested that Chelsea might have been left without their hard-won prize. But FIFA was quick to set the record straight. In reality, there are three versions of the Club World Cup trophy, each with its own story and home: For one, it reflects the United States' growing role in world football. Keeping a version of the trophy in the Oval Office signals not only appreciation for hosting duties but also recognition of football's expanding influence in U.S. culture. For years, the sport trailed behind American football, basketball, and baseball. But with the influx of international stars in Major League Soccer and high-profile tournaments held on U.S. soil, the game's profile has never been higher. Politically, the trophy also serves as a prop for Trump, whose image often thrives on spectacle and symbolism.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As stormy Monsoon session ends, all you need to know When the White House recently posted a picture of Trump with some other world leaders at his official residence, some sharp football fans noticed something they didn't expect to find at the Oval Office – the FIFA Club World Cup trophy. Premier League outfit Chelsea clinched the silverware last month, beating UEFA Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain in the final in New Jersey. When asked about it, Trump said he had been told he could keep it, in recognition of the United States hosting the month-long tournament. “I said, ‘When are you going to pick up the trophy?' You can have it forever in the Oval Office, we're making a new one',” Trump was quoted as saying in an interview with DAZN. So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval [Office] right now.” But football's world governing body cleared the air on any confusion, informing that there are in fact three Club World Club trophies in existence. All original trophies – including the FIFA World Cup – stay there. Winners of every FIFA tournament get a replica to keep and showcase. The Club World Cup was held across 11 cities in the United States, but there was criticism over low attendances, high temperatures and poor quality of playing surfaces. It was considered a sort of dress rehearsal for next year's 48-team FIFA World Cup which the US will co-host along with Canada and Mexico.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Clubs in Spain and Portugal have looked at the attacking midfielder, while Parma in Italy had also previously expressed an interest. Reyna is thought to be open to the move as he looks for more regular first-team football ahead of next year's World Cup, which the United States will host alongside Canada and Mexico. A move to Gladbach would see him join up with USMNT team-mate Joe Scally. Reyna was not included in Mauricio Pochettino's 2025 Gold Cup squad this summer as Dortmund wanted him to be part of the squad that travelled to the U.S. for the Club World Cup. Reyna's Dortmund career has been heavily disrupted by injuries since he joined as a 16-year-old in July 2019. He made 26 appearances last season but only five of those were starts. Reyna was sidelined for two and a half months, missing 19 games for club and country, after picking up a groin issue in early September. He spent the second half of the 2023-24 campaign on loan at Premier League side Nottingham Forest, playing in 10 games. Reyna has featured 147 times for Dortmund, scoring 19 goals and providing 18 assists. He became the youngest player to make 50 Bundesliga appearances aged 18 years and 14 days, a record that has since been broken by Florian Wirtz, who joined Liverpool this summer. Reyna received his first USMNT call-up in November 2020 and has been capped 32 times, scoring eight goals and representing the nation at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. It's been several years since he was a consistent member of the first team: he started three Bundesliga games last season and just one the year before. The need for a career reset is self-evident and perhaps Gladbach, who remain a big club, albeit one some way down from its historic peaks in the 1970s, can be an ideal venue to rediscover some momentum. Instead, it was availability, and Reyna's struggle to avoid the small muscular issues that have so often derailed his progress and prevented him from establishing a rhythm at the Westfalenstadion. Ultimately, that is why the club have allowed his contract to run down and now, with a year left until its end, are happy to allow him to leave. Can Reyna regain his status in the game? For now, though, the aim is simpler: he must find somewhere to play consistently.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mauricio Pedroza and Janusz Michallik discuss Ricardo Pepi's future at PSV. The opening weeks of the European club season have seen some auspicious starts. Norwich City's Josh Sargent continues to bang in the goals, with his tally against Portsmouth already giving him three on the young season. Chris Richards and Crystal Palace secured an impressive road shutout at Chelsea, and Sergiño Dest continued his fine form for PSV Eindhoven. The most notable performances of the weekend came from players in Christian Pulisic and Johnny Cardoso who have had some attention around them -- not all of it positive. Throughout the season, ESPN will be monitoring the progress of the U.S. men's national team player pool, delivering insights into those whose form or fitness has made them particularly intriguing. ESPN will count down to June 11 every week so that way, when the U.S. team is announced for this highly anticipated World Cup on home soil, no names on that 26-man roster will come as a surprise. Pulisic's summer of discontent -- complete with deciding to skip the Gold Cup, some subtle sniping with U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino, and then a not-so-subtle war-of-words with former USMNT players over his decision -- finally got back to focusing on his actual performances. And after shaking off an ankle injury, Pulisic delivered for his club, scoring Milan's second goal from a sharp reception and finish on the turn in what was a 2-0 win over Bari in the Coppa Italia. The 66-minute performance reinforced a truism about Pulisic and his USMNT teammates: If he plays well, he'll be praised. Might some of that criticism be over the top? But like it or not, this is what he signed up for, and using his docuseries as a platform to complain about said criticism won't change that. With next summer's World Cup now only 10 months away, the scrutiny on Pulisic and his play is only bound to increase. His start to the season is nonetheless encouraging. There has been plenty of head-scratching when it comes to Cardoso and the USMNT. Namely, why doesn't he replicate his club form at international level? Cardoso's debut for Atléti on Sunday against Espanyol elicited a very different type of question. Why was he subbed out at halftime by manager Diego Simeone? It's a decision made all the more puzzling given how Cardoso performed. Atlético were up 1-0 when he departed, only to lose the match 3-2 when Espanyol rallied for two goals. Simeone even praised Cardoso for his play and acknowledged he needed to reexamine his decisions. "I'll take something away from that. Given that Cardoso earned compliments, it's a start that bodes well for continued playing time on a very competitive squad. Now the challenge for Pochettino is to find a way to get the best out of Cardoso when he dons a different red, white and blue jersey. There's always a danger in reading too much into preseason. There are youngsters to try out, fitness levels to manage, and in the case of Juventus, there's recovery from a packed summer that included the FIFA Club World Cup. All of that said, when it comes to McKennie, how big of a role will he end up playing for Juve this season? It seems to be an annual query. Last season, McKennie was ever-present, making a total of 48 league and cup appearances. But if the past three friendlies are anything to go by, the U.S. midfielder will be hard-pressed to repeat that level of activity. As the Serie A opener against Genoa nears this weekend, and with manager Igor Tudor opting for a 3-4-3 formation, McKennie has seen his playing time steadily decrease, with him entering last weekend's friendly against Atalanta in second-half stoppage time. There have also been reports he might be headed to AS Roma. If McKennie remains with Juve as a squad player, the team's presence in the UEFA Champions League figures to result in plenty of player rotation, but it's a less-than-ideal scenario for McKennie and the USMNT; it also might open the door for a fringe player or two. If the World Cup started tomorrow, who would make up Pochettino's starting XI? Each week we take our best attempt to name a starting lineup based on form and fitness, which means there's no room for injured players. Even as Dest returns to health, a competition is brewing for the remaining outside back slots. Antonee Robinson, when healthy, is the presumed starter at left back, but he has yet to even make the gameday roster in recent weeks for Fulham as he continues to recover from offseason knee surgery. One possible option on the left side, Watford's Caleb Wiley, is in a similar situation with a back injury. Joe Scally has played on either flank for both club and country, and has been a steady presence on the backline for Borussia Mönchengladbach, making more than 30 appearances in each of the past four seasons. However, Pochettino has shown a clear preference for outside backs who can contribute to the attack, whereas Scally's strengths lie more on the defensive end of the field. Last season, in 32 league appearances, he had no goals or assists, and created only 11 chances. That has led Pochettino to look at other options. Both Max Arfsten of the Columbus Crew and Orlando City SC's Alex Freeman logged the majority of minutes available at outside back during the Gold Cup. Arfsten showed some vulnerabilities in his defending, but improved as the tournament progressed and chipped in with a goal in the quarterfinal win against Costa Rica. Holstein Kiel's John Tolkin got time in the Gold Cup as well, and started the club season in dream fashion, scoring Kiel's opener in the 2-0 victory over Homburg in the DFB-Pokal. The sequence showed off Tolkin's passing, mobility and finishing ability. His edge in defending means he cracks this week's in-form XI. That is by no means the extent of Pochettino's options when it comes to outside backs. Tim Weah's debut for Marseille last weekend came as a wing back, and Yunus Musah's early days under new Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri have seen him play in a similar role. Weah has shown flexibility in the past at club level in terms of playing on either flank, although for the USMNT, his value lies farther upfield given his ability to stretch and get behind defenses. The September window should reveal plenty. ESPN's USMNT Big Board 1.0 went live earlier this month, and each Big Board will provide the foundation for weekly player updates. Below are the minutes and player ratings for each of those 35 players. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Turner might get the nod in the in-form XI, but Steffen is doing all he can to push for more consideration from Pochettino. Steffen's goals prevented mark of 6.33 is the third highest in MLS, showing a level of consistency that was absent last season. The big challenge for Steffen is simply staying healthy. If he does, he should get a chance to battle for the starting goalkeeping spot. McKenzie remains the leading contender to push for Ream's spot in the center of the USMNT defense, and he delivered a composed performance in Toulouse's season-opening 1-0 win over Nice, completing 93% of his passes and winning 67% of his duels. Consistency with the USMNT has been an issue, but he's off to the right kind of start with his club. Chris Richards speaks after Crystal Palace's penalty shootout win over Liverpool in the Community Shield. Luna sat out last weekend's 1-0 defeat to Charlotte as he was suspended because of a red card he picked up against the New York Red Bulls. Luna now has seven yellow cards and two ejections on the season. He's obviously getting more attention from opponents, but he'll need to find a way to keep his composure as well as the edge with which he plays. Not at all easy, but a trait he'll need to refine. Zendejas looks to be cooling off a bit ... or is he? During the two tournaments that comprised the 2024-25 Liga MX season, Zendejas had 11 goals from 7.07 xG across 40 matches. So far this season, Zendejas has one goal from 1.36 xG in five matches. Still early days yet, but if Zendejas continues to get chances, his goal scoring should round into form.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The other one, sitting in the Oval Office, making memes every time it pops up during a major US presidential announcement or high-level meeting. Just this week it cameoed in an urgent audience with Volodymyr Zelensky, this time flanked by several European allies, seeking an end to Russia's war in Ukraine. There it was, the extravagant Tiffany & Co collaboration inspired by NASA's missions into space, in the background of the most important gathering since Trump “made no deal until there's a deal” with Vladimir Putin in Alaska a few days ago. The 24-carat gold-plated silverware, with its rotating discs and periodic table and astronomical maps, was hand-delivered to the White House in March by FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who created it and had his name engraved on it – twice. It is, according to FIFA, one of three existing trophies, along with the original version at FIFA headquarters in Zurich and the one now belonging to Chelsea. Trump said he was told he could keep his, and the juxtaposition of a global crisis and a football trophy – along with a winner's medal, possibly meant for Noni Madueke (The Art of the Steal) – in the same room gives such Big Trump Energy it has fast become a source of comic relief. Man of the match Cole Palmer admitted to being “a bit confused”. It all makes it kind of difficult to take seriously the notion that this Disneyland of a reconstituted tournament could reportedly, after 2029, take place every two years instead of every four and feature 48 teams. His transformation of this year's Club World Cup to 32 teams – from the long-running and largely ignored seven-team format contested by six continental champions plus one host club – is keeping with this model, and the next step appears inevitable. Staged as 63 games across 11 American cities, it was divisive. For the sparse crowds in cavernous NFL stadiums (over a million empty seats defied Infantino's prediction of “63 Super Bowls in one month”). On the latter, Infantino has been the subject of intense hostility from domestic leagues and players' unions, to the point FIFA has been fighting legal fires over the world governing body's alleged “abuse of dominance” and lack of consultation when adding to an insanely congested international calendar. A Europe-based player who participates in Euro 2024, the 2025 Club World Cup and the 2026 World Cup will effectively have zero rest for three straight off-seasons. There is no room to move, and how the Club World Cup affects the domestic season of Chelsea and PSG et al may yet be revealing. Then back into the oppressive North American summer heat they will go for a World Cup across three countries in the US, Canada, and Mexico. There's nothing like watching an injured player doing his best work. “FIFA was put on earth really to regulate the global game and to run international football, and the Club World Cup is a move into club football,” Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said earlier this month. FIFPro president Sergio Marchi, meanwhile, labelled it “nothing more than a fiction created by FIFA” and its “grandiloquent staging inevitably reminiscent of the ‘bread and circuses' of Nero's Rome”. There are so many more voices in this debate, but for the sake of brevity, let's stick with former Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp, who called it “the worst idea ever implemented in football in this regard”. Arsene Wenger, a vocal critic of fixture congestion throughout his previous role overseeing Arsenal, has now taken a “fantastic competition” view in his current capacity as FIFA's chief of global football development. He added that every club involved would favour this format moving forward – and of course they would when the prize fund is $US1 billion. Chelsea received an estimated $US114.6 million; it is little surprise other big European clubs would like a piece of the pie. Real Madrid's reported push for a biennial cycle is apparently supported by other clubs who failed to qualify for this year's tournament, including Barcelona, Manchester United, Liverpool and Napoli. The proposal for 48 teams fits that agenda given that, unless FIFA lifts its cap of 12 European entrants and two from each country, expansion is the only way to ensure more European clubs (notwithstanding other cross-continental quirks in the qualifying criteria). But this tells us what the Club World Cup is not. It is not a bucket-list trophy like the World Cup or continental championships. Had Inter Miami (demolished by PSG in the round of 16) won, Lionel Messi would not have retired any more contented for the privilege (he already has three of the old Club World Cups with Barcelona). There is no way he would have picked this space-age trophy over the World Cup he finally added to his otherwise complete CV in 2022. That is not to say the football was bad. It's hard to imagine Lionel Messi retiring happier because he won another Club World Cup.Credit: AP In this sense, the organisers were savvy, offering an extended hand to the peripheral or uninitiated football fan, and to America's diaspora who comprised a portion of these numbers (not that this was intended given the Trump administration's stance on diversity and immigration). It offered hope for the future of such an event, if treated more modestly. But FIFA is nothing if not bloated, and the money speaks for itself: the revenue averaged out at $US33 million per match.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pierce County leaders gather to discuss plans for the World Cup in 2026. We're expecting three-quarters of a million people, visitors from around the world,” Pierce County Executive Ryan Mello said. Mello, along with other county officials and representatives from Pierce Transit, held a summit Wednesday morning. “We got to put ourselves in the shoes of customers — customers who are not from here, customers who don't speak our language, and help serve them so they can have a great time,” Mello said. Pierce Transit expects demand could be higher than ever. “We expect it's going to almost double our ridership. And we're fortunate that the state, in this last session, came up with some money for transit agencies,” Mike Griffus, CEO of Pierce Transit, said. Griffus said they also expect money from the federal government to help offset any additional costs of moving people where they want to go, when they want to go. There will be multi-day Orca passes, so visitors won't need to pay a fare every time they want to change locations or get to and from matches. There will also be ADA accommodations,” he added. Proper planning now will create a successful event. How to help move people around safely and strategically, and smoothly, and how we benefit from hosting these games long into the future,” Mello said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Six games will be held at Seattle's Lumen Field, including one group stage game for the U.S Men's National Team, as well as two knockout games in the Round of 16 and Round of 32. For those who aren't able to or willing to pay the hefty price tag of a ticket, there will be nine Fan Zones throughout Washington, including one in Tacoma. It's for this reason that Pierce Transit is laser-focused on creating solutions to the high traffic volumes they'll be faced with. "Unless we want freeways and roads, jam and no parking, these people will be taking transit,” explained Pierce Transit CEO Mike Griffus. Mello, who is also an acting member of the Pierce and Sound Transit boards, explains that Pierce Transit will be increasing its number of bus routes, while also looking to up the frequency of those routes to help fans get around the Puget Sound. One area they'll be focused on is the Link Light Rail expansion coming to Federal Way, which is expected to open in December 2025. “Because of the capacity that we're going to have to serve, this is what we call [a] surge," explained Mello. Mello also said that with such a major increase in ridership, with many international visitors being non-English speakers, they are exploring a new payment method, called "Open Payment" for their buses. "We're working on Open Payment, so folks can just use the credit card or their debit card in their wallet to tap and pay and get to where they want to go in a much more seamless way." Mello said they hope to have that system running by early 2026. They have until Dec. 1 to give the state a plan on how they would spend their portion of the funding. A spokesperson explained that in this year's budget, the legislature set aside $9 million for transit agencies, which breaks down like this:</p>
