                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Texas map advances: After a standoff that lasted over two weeks, Texas is poised to pass a GOP-drawn congressional map this evening. The redistricting plan — backed by President Donald Trump — would create five more GOP-leaning House districts in time for next year's midterm elections. • California redistricting push: At the same time, California Democrats are working through a series of votes on a plan that would allow them to temporarily redraw the state's congressional maps — if voters approve. • Trump to join patrol in DC: Meanwhile, Trump said he plans to join law enforcement in the nation's capital this evening, after he federalized the city's police force and deployed the National Guard, citing a public safety emergency. Read our fact check of his claims on DC crime. The California Assembly and Senate have each separately passed their first of three redistricting bills that will ask voters to swap the state's current congressional maps for new ones aimed at netting Democrats an additional five seats in the US House. All three bills need a two-thirds majority in both chambers to pass. Why this matters: Democrats have framed their redistricting push as a countermeasure to moves by GOP-led states like Texas, which is in the process of passing new maps that could net Republicans up to five additional seats. The plan from Democrats initially included a trigger to only take effect if another state engaged in mid-decade redistricting. This post has been updated with information about the state Senate vote. President Donald Trump appeared to offer a rationale for Ukraine to go on offense against Russia today — notable rhetoric as the momentum around peace talks has stalled. “It is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invader's country. It is like that with Ukraine and Russia,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. He criticized the Biden administration, which had a long-standing policy that Ukraine could not launch long-range American-made missiles into Russia. That changed in November 2024, following pressure from US allies. Efforts for peace talks: Trump's comments come as the Kremlin has openly contradicted the White House on plans for a bilateral meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, suggesting that leader-level talks are far from imminent and that Putin has yet to agree to such a meeting. What Zelensky is saying: Zelensky said Russia's massive overnight attacks on Ukraine demonstrate Moscow is “trying to wriggle out of the need to hold a meeting.” In his nightly video address today, the Ukrainian president said the Russians “do not want to end this war. They are continuing their massive attacks against Ukraine and very fierce assaults on the front lines.” Other diplomacy: Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney talked today about “how to build on the president's leadership to support long-term peace and security for Ukraine and Europe,” according to a statement from the prime minister's office. Vice President JD Vance declined to say where law enforcement officials are sending homeless people in Washington, DC, after their encampments are cleared. Pressed on the matter during a visit to Georgia, Vance said “The question betrays a certain misunderstanding of what we're trying to do and what is the nature of real compassion.” He then recounted a story about his family being yelled during a trip to DC years ago, arguing that the administration is focused on keeping those with mental health issues off the streets. “Why have we convinced ourselves that it's compassionate to allow a person who's obviously a schizophrenic, or suffering from some other mental illness, why is it compassionate to let that person fester in the streets?” Vance said. “We have focused on Washington, DC, because it's a federal city under our jurisdiction but we certainly hope that, whether it's Atlanta or anywhere else, people are going to look around and say, ‘We don't have to live like this,'” he said. The president has repeatedly complained about rising crime in DC, but overall crime numbers are lower this year than in 2024. Democrats and Republicans are engaged in a battles over redistricting in California and Texas as they seek to influence  the upcoming midterm elections. Before we get into those details, the news in Washington, DC, is that President Donald Trump said in an interview that he plans to join law enforcement on the streets of the capital tonight. A senior White House official said the details are still being worked out, but this comes after Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth staged a lunch to thank the National Guard members deployed to DC at the Shake Shack inside Union Station. Now it's ready for a vote in the full Texas Senate. ET), but it's unclear how quickly they will take up the bill, as other items are also on the calendar.

Texas Republicans are poised to pass a new congressional map backed by President Donald Trump that will create five more GOP-leaning House districts in time for next year's midterm elections. Watch CNN's Arlette Saenz reports on how the Democratic governor of California plans to fight back. Texas Republicans are poised to pass a new congressional map backed by President Donald Trump that will create five more GOP-leaning House districts in time for next year's midterm elections. CNN's Arlette Saenz reports from Austin about how Gov. You also can watch this report here on YouTube Former GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said he will be raising funds to defeat California Democrats' redistricting proposal introduced in response to the GOP effort in Texas to redraw congressional lines ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Saying there's a “unique group” forming to oppose California redistricting, McCarthy touted the efforts of Charles Munger, son of a late billionaire financier, and former GOP Gov. “This is something that could be very dangerous nationwide if the Democrats move forward, because Republicans could do this in more states than the Democrats,” McCarthy told CNN's Dana Bash on “Inside Politics.” The former speaker repeatedly said that Texas “has a right to do what they're going to do,” referencing the 10th Amendment. The former GOP House speaker and onetime California Assembly member also referenced his own support for a citizens redistricting commission in the state legislature. And he cautioned Republicans against drawing too many conclusions from the results of previous elections. “Look, I think any times people play with this, things move — you try to draw a line because you think, (in) the last election, President Trump did exceptionally well. I think that stuff always blows back on you,” McCarthy said. President Donald Trump said in an interview that he plans to join law enforcement on the streets of Washington, DC, this evening. Trump's plan comes a day after Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth staged a lunch to thank the National Guard members deployed to DC at the Shake Shack inside Union Station. Many of the National Guard members at the lunch said they had come from South Carolina — one of six red states that have announced they have or will send guard members to DC. Others include West Virginia, Ohio, Mississippi, Louisiana and Tennessee. The president has repeatedly complained about rising crime in DC, but overall crime numbers are lower this year than in 2024. This post has been updated with additional information on Trump's deployment of the National Guard and federalization of DC police. President Donald Trump and New York Attorney General Letitia James are both claiming victory after a mixed ruling from an appeals court in the civil fraud case against the president. Others were afraid to do business there,” he said. Trump also took aim at James, as well as the administration of former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, baselessly claiming in part that the cases against him were “an attack” from his political opponents. She said her office would continue to appeal, but pointed out the court upheld the injunctive relief that limits Trump's ability to do business in New York. The bill was approved in the Special Committee on Congressional Redistricting with five senators voting in favor, three opposed and one absent. The state's upper chamber will reconvene at 7 p.m. local time (8 p.m. ET), but it's unclear how quickly they will take up the bill, as other items are also on the calendar. The redistricting plan — backed by President Donald Trump — would create five more GOP-leaning House districts in time for next year's midterm elections. “I want us to maintain a Republican majority and hopefully increase the Republican majority in the US Congress and that's my purpose for being willing to carry this map.” Democrats will challenge Republican redistricting efforts after the Texas House passed GOP-drawn congressional maps, Texas State Rep. Gina Hinojosa told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. This is a direct attack on not just the Voting Rights Act, but it is a direct attack on the constitutional rights of people of color in Texas,” Hinojosa said in an interview today. Hinojosa also said that while there are efforts from some blue states to offset the gerrymandering attempt in Texas, it may not be enough to undo the harm to Texans' constitutional rights, particularly for minorities. The Democrat said she's glad California is “taking actions to protect against and nullify what Texas is doing,” but for Texans, if the redistricting bill is not overturned by federal courts, “nothing that the other states do will take away from that harm” that the state's legislation will cause. This post has been updated with additional comments from Hinojosa. The Texas state Senate's Special Committee on Congressional Redistricting is holding a hearing right now on the state's new congressional maps. The Trump-backed redistricting plan, which would create five more GOP-leaning House districts, must be approved by the state's upper chamber before heading to Gov. The full state Senate is expected to reconvene around 8 p.m. The vice president will also use the opportunity to take aim at Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, who is up for reelection in 2026 and a top target for Republicans' bid to keep control of the chamber. In a statement, Vance communications director Will Martin highlighted provisions increasing the child tax credit and creating a new tax deduction for older Americans — while vowing to attack Ossoff for voting against the broader domestic policy law. Trump administration officials have narrowed their rhetoric since passing the multitrillion-dollar bill, focusing on a small handful of tax provisions that they believe will resonate with Americans in the run-up to next year's midterm elections. The more focused messaging effort represents a significant departure from the White House's stance earlier this year, when Trump insisted on passing as wide-ranging a package as possible so that “there's something for everyone.” California's Supreme Court yesterday rejected a challenge from state Republicans who filed a lawsuit with the court earlier this week requesting it stop the state's redistricting effort. Petitioners have failed to meet their burden of establishing a basis for relief at this time under California Constitution article IV, section 8,” according to the court's docket. Californians deserve fair, transparent elections, not secret backroom deals to protect politicians.” Meanwhile, we have some updates on Trump's push for peace between Russia and Ukraine: Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is accusing Ukraine and Europe of undermining US efforts to resolve the conflict, following the Alaska summit between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. Lavrov also claimed European representatives were deliberately trying to “disrupt the agenda” to achieve a sustainable peace settlement by “ignoring Russian interests” and shifting the discussion toward providing security guarantees for Ukraine without Russia's participation. He expressed hope that what he called a “conspiracy” would fail, vowing Moscow would continue following the path “clearly agreed upon” during the Alaska talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also told journalists yesterday he is ready to make “some compromise” on his demand that a ceasefire takes place before any talks with Putin — as long as some security guarantees for Ukraine are established. His comments come as Moscow openly contradicts the White House narrative that plans for a bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelensky are “underway.” Lavrov said yesterday that the Kremlin proposed sending higher-level officials to talks with Ukraine, with no confirmation that Russia supports a meeting at the leadership level between Putin and Zelensky. A day after he hosted a summit of US and European leaders at the White House, Trump reiterated his desire to quickly set up a meeting between the Ukrainian and Russian presidents. Trump then aims to hold a trilateral sit-down with Putin and Zelensky. After weeks of opposition and days of heated committee meetings and floor debates, lawmakers in both states are on track to pass their redistricting efforts today. In California, the state Assembly and Senate will consider a trio of bills that will allow for a special election to pass a constitutional amendment to replace the state's existing congressional maps through 2030. California Democrats have described their redistricting push as reaction to the Texas plan and President Donald Trump's effort to create a more favorable 2026 midterm election map. The legislation includes a trigger clause that says the state will only move forward if other states — such as Texas — seek to implement their own mid-decade redistricting. All three need a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers to pass. But they're only 1 for 3 in presidential elections against him. Twice, they impeached him — but that didn't destroy his political career. They've tried to “go high” when he went low. And painting Trump as the worst-ever threat to American democracy didn't thwart the greatest White House comeback story in history. California state legislators are expected on Thursday to pass bills to set up a statewide referendum in November on redrawing the state's congressional maps in a way that could net Democrats five seats in the House of Representatives. The counterattack went into force after deep-red Texas enacted its plan, ordered by the president, to launch a rare mid-cycle redistricting effort in search of five Republican House seats. Texas is on the cusp of passing a new GOP-drawn congressional map. The state Senate is currently weighing a version of the map that is slightly different from one originally passed during their first legislative session. As we await a full vote on the GOP's final map, here's how their original proposal would have differed from the current districts:</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FEMA also still owes North Carolina hundreds of millions in promised recovery funds from last year's Hurricane Helene. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. WRAL reported Tuesday that the Tar Heel State is still waiting on $13 million in federal disaster preparedness grants from FEMA. That announcement came after Stein sent US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem a letter in July asking why she had not signed off on the disbursal of the desperately needed funds. “Applications submitted as far back as February 2025 remain without a final decision,” Stein wrote in the letter, which laid out $209 million worth of Helene recovery projects still awaiting her sign-off. Even though some funds are reportedly flowing, Stein says the government has yet to reimburse North Carolina for over $100 million. “It creates real financial strain, especially on local governments, but also the state,” Stein said in a press conference. Noem's leadership of FEMA came under severe scrutiny earlier this summer after it was reported that her policies hampered the agency's ability to respond to the devastating flooding that killed at least 138 people in Texas. In June, Noem introduced a new policy requiring all FEMA expenditures over $100,000 to be personally approved by her, which officials within the agency said led to the deployment of search and rescue teams being delayed for days. Two-thirds of the phone calls from desperate Texans to FEMA also went unanswered after Noem allowed hundreds of contractors to be laid off just a day after the storm hit. On the ground, there are about 20% fewer permanent FEMA staff responsible for responding to hurricanes and other disasters. Emergency training for those who remained on the job was also rolled back. Sarah Galvez, Climate Power's senior adviser for climate urgency, says that communities in the path of Hurricane Erin “are being put at risk thanks to the Trump Administration gutting the forecasting that people rely on during extreme weather.” But as part of a multi-pronged assault on climate science, Trump has also made it harder to track these and other disasters. “Fueled by the climate crisis,” Galvez says, “major hurricanes are only becoming more frequent and severe, but Trump's reckless actions have left Americans vulnerable and unprepared.” On Tuesday, Reps. Greg Casar (D-Texas) and Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) introduced legislation aimed at rolling back Trump's cuts to these agencies. Hurricane Erin is hitting the East Coast right now.Earlier this year, Trump slashed funding for FEMA and NOAA — the agencies that keep us safe before and after disasters. My new bill would reverse Trump's cuts and restore crucial resources for families across the country. “As we continue to face increasing numbers of natural disasters across our country — wildfires, floods, hurricanes — it's critically important that we equip our communities with the resources they need,” Neguse said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump referred to Crimea as a piece of land "right in the ocean" that is "the size of Texas" while talking on the Mark Levin Show, a right-wing talk radio program, on Aug. 20. It's, you know, this massive piece of land stuck out right in the ocean, right in the Black Sea. I mean, it's so beautiful," he told Levin, before adding that Ukraine was told by former U.S. President Barack Obama to "give it up to Russia." Russia invaded Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in February 2014 amid the deadliest days of the EuroMaidan Revolution that eventually ousted Ukraine's pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. Around 30,000 Russian troops crossed into Crimea, taking hold of the peninsula by early March 2014 and soon declaring its illegal annexation. Here's what you need to know about Crimea and Russia's ongoing occupation. Crimea is roughly 26 times smaller than Texas and is not located "in the middle of the ocean" — it is a peninsula in the Black Sea, around 27,000 square kilometers (10,400 square miles) in size. Texas, meanwhile, is a little over 10% larger than the entire territory of Ukraine. Crimea is connected to Ukraine by land to the north, where it meets Kherson Oblast, which Russia has partially occupied since 2022. The bridge is a highly strategic (and illegal) construction that Ukraine regularly targets due to its role as a critical transport route for Russian forces to occupied Ukrainian territories. On June 3, Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) confirmed it had carried out a third strike targeting the bridge, detonating 1,100 kilograms of explosives beneath its underwater supports. After Russia moved its forces into Crimea in early 2014, Moscow swiftly held a sham referendum in the absence of any international observers and with armed Russian soldiers present at polling locations. While Trump blamed Obama on the Mark Levin show for Russia's annexation, in April 2025, he questioned why Ukraine “didn't fight” for Crimea. “Why didn't they fight for it eleven years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?” he wrote on his Truth Social platform on April 23. There are multiple reasons why Russia was able to take Crimea so easily. The Kremlin had been amassing troops in Crimea for years thanks to agreements with Ukraine's pro-Russian President Yanukovych that allowed it to station its Black Sea Fleet on the peninsula and move its troops around without restrictions. It also covertly brought modernized or refurbished equipment into Crimea between 2010 and 2014, according to Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR). While Russia claims that Crimea is Russian, the native inhabitants of Crimea are Crimean Tatars, the peninsula's indigenous people and a national minority of Ukraine. Their history is marked by centuries of conflict and repression at the hands of Moscow, something that has only continued under Russian occupation to this day. Up to 200,000 Crimean Tatars – mostly women, children, and the elderly – were deported to Central Asia and Siberia on Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin's orders. Among them were the families of well-known Ukrainians, including former defense minister Rustem Umerov and singer Jamala. “It's so beautiful,” Trump repeatedly told Levin on Aug. 20, a statement all Ukrainians would likely agree with. As well as being the homeland of Crimean Tatars, the peninsula was an immensely popular summer vacation destination for generations of Ukrainians. Among Ukrainians, Crimea evokes memories of carefree vacations, time spent with family, and peace. Now, Russia has transformed Crimea into a strategic base for supporting the occupation of other Ukrainian territories. Areas that were once popular vacation destinations have now been converted into military bases for Russian soldiers. "Crimea currently serves two functions: as a springboard for potential offensive operations and as a base for supplying Russian forces in southern Ukraine." The U.S. was reportedly considering recognizing Crimea as Russian in April 2025 — a move that would violate international law. The U.S. and EU responded by imposing asset freezes, travel bans, and other sanctions on various Russian officials involved in the military occupation. During his first term in office, Trump even reaffirmed the U.S.'s opposition to Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea by adopting the Crimea Declaration. Issued by then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the declaration stated that the U.S. “rejects Russia's attempted annexation of Crimea and pledges to maintain this policy until Ukraine's territorial integrity is restored.” According to Ukraine's constitution, Crimea is a legally recognized and inseparable part of Ukraine, and no acts can be passed by the Ukrainian government that contradict it. Ukraine's constitution also can't be changed during martial law. She previously worked as a news editor at the Kyiv Independent and was an intern at the Kyiv Post in 2018.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Critics say Max, a WhatsApp rival, could be used to track users, though state media says it is not a spying app A Russian state-backed messenger application called Max, a rival to WhatsApp that critics say could be used to track users, must be pre-installed on all mobile phones and tablets bought in the country starting next month, the Russian government said on Thursday. The Kremlin said in a statement that Max, which will be integrated with government services, would be on a list of mandatory pre-installed apps on all “gadgets”, including mobile phones and tablets, sold in Russia from 1 September. The firm behind Max said this week that 18 million users had downloaded its app, parts of which are still in a testing phase. State media says accusations from Kremlin critics that Max is a spying app are false and that it has fewer permissions to access user data than rivals WhatsApp and Telegram. It will also be mandatory from 1 September for Russia's domestic app store, RuStore, which is pre-installed on all Android devices, to be pre-installed on Apple devices. The push to promote homegrown apps comes after Russia said this month it had started restricting some calls on WhatsApp, owned by Meta Platforms, and on Telegram, accusing the foreign-owned platforms of failing to share information with law enforcement in fraud and terrorism cases. The third most popular messenger app in July, according to Mediascope data, was VK Messenger, at 17.9 million users, an offering from the same state-controlled tech company VK which developed Max. A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Russia's interior ministry said on Wednesday that Max was safer than foreign rivals, but that it had arrested a suspect in the first fraud case using the new messenger.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Like hundreds of thousands of other travellers this past week, my daughter and I were left stranded during the Air Canada strike. Less than 30 minutes after our flight's official cancellation on Aug. 16, I couldn't find two seats back to Toronto from Calgary on any airline at any price. The closest I could get was Hamilton – nearly two hours from my home – on a different airline, four days hence and at twice the original ticket cost. The customer service agent said I should consider myself lucky. Previously, I'd only passed through Calgary on my way to ski resorts. What would I find in the height of summer? There was no way I was hanging out near the airport – a 45-minute bus ride away – for four days. The people-watching was a good distraction; this is obviously where many Calgarians have celebrated for decades, judging by the old photos that line many corridors. Even Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip dropped by in 1993. We cycled breezily along the riverside path, which was busy with pedestrians, scooter traffic and other bike-riders. It was a great, tangible nugget of Canadian history and we talked about it as we rode farther along the river. My daughter wanted to check out an adorable cafe in Fish Creek Provincial Park (part of the Bow Ranch parkland) – 50 kilometres there and back. We needed a way to work off our frustration with being stuck, and the scenery and living-like-a-local feeling made the saddle sores worth it. Cyclists on faster bikes nodded sympathetically at our heavy cruisers but we managed. My only regret was not jumping into the water fully clothed at Harvie Passage, a conduit off the Bow where families float along gentle rapids. On another day, we stumbled upon the Smithbilt hat factory in Inglewood. We tried on hats, boots and fringed jackets, and wondered where we could possibly wear them back home. The longer I was in town, the more easily I could convince myself that cowboy boots were essential. On his recommendation, we headed back downtown to Alberta Boot, a local maker established in 1978. Alberta Boot Co. customers often want to customize everything from the leathers, colours, stitch patterns and heel shapes – and some even have their personal branding burned in.Catherine Dawson March/The Globe and Mail Visitors can ask for a quick tour, and that's how I met master bootmaker Antonio Juarez, who learned the trade from his father and grandfather in Mexico and has worked here for 23 years. The contract to make RCMP boots is steady and he's always busy around Stampede time, but he's surprised at how the demand for custom work has skyrocketed. “Every boot that we have in the factory now except for one or two racks of stock boots … is specialized.” Customers want to choose their own leathers, colours, stitch patterns and heel shapes, and have their personal branding burned in – with price being no object. The lively patio scene along pedestrian Stephen Avenue drew us back often (Sunday all-day happy hour! ), but we were also charmed by the rest of this national historic district, where shops and restaurants fill the onetime banks and low-rise office buildings. The architecture is a gorgeous mix of decorative styles from the Edwardian, Victorian, art deco and beaux-arts eras. One afternoon we spotted Pho Daddy on 4th Street SW. Its outdoor wrought-iron staircase reminded us of Montreal. Inside, friendly counter staff let us sample the different broths before we ordered enormous steaming bowls of hearty pho. Vietnamese iced coffee was served in an authentic phin drip filter and far surpassed any I've ever had. Right next door, we spent a delightfully long time browsing the stacks of Shelf Life Books, an independent seller specializing in titles from small publishers and Canadian authors. We turned back to Alberta Boot's factory shop. The writer received a media rate for Fairmont Palliser. It did not review or approve the story before publication.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>California governor triggers Magasphere with his torrent of long rants, AI memes and pithy nicknames on social media in latest tactic As Gavin Newsom attempts to cement his place as the likely Democratic candidate for the 2028 election, he is turning to a familiar playbook. The California governor's social media account has been filled with a torrent of long rants in capital letters, AI memes of himself topless riding bears and a series of pithy nicknames for his political enemies. The 57-year-old has packed his communications department with Gen-Z advisers who are helping the Democrat Maga-fy himself by mimicking Donald Trump and riling up his Republican base in turn. In one AI meme, shared by the governor, Mr Newsom's visage has been added to Mount Rushmore. Mr Trump's supporters, Tucker Carlson, Kid Rock and the late Hulk Hogan appearing in angel form, pray over the governor in another provocative AI image. Abigail Jackson, the deputy White House press secretary, shot back, decrying the governor, who was evoking her boss, as “very weird and not at all funny”. Dana Perino, the Fox News host, who appeared to miss his ironic tone, earnestly advised Mr Newsom that if he wanted to run for president he needed to “be a little more serious”. The governor has brushed off criticism of his brash new strategy, claiming he is issuing a “wake-up call” to Mr Trump. If you've got issues with what I'm putting out, you sure as hell should have concerns about what he's putting out as president,” he said. Charlie Kirk, Steve Bannon and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich have all appeared on his new show called This is Gavin Newsom. But his embrace of the Right-wing was short-lived and Democrats argue Mr Newsom's parody social media posts cast him as the official Republican opposition. “There's no question that a front on the battlefield is online, social media and to date there are few Democrats who have been able to use those tools effectively and to really get the kind of attention that the Right has been very good at capturing,” he said. His comments reflect a growing sentiment in the Democratic Party and its base that its politicians need to stop taking the high road. “The big divide in the Democrats right now is not, you know, liberals versus establishment, or progressives versus liberals, it's very much, are you a fighter or are you not?” said Christopher Galdieri, a politics professor at Saint Anselm. Mr Newsom's Maga tweets show him as someone willing to put his head above the parapet and go tete-a-tete with his political rivals. “It's a clear sign of ambitions about 2028 and I think he's banking on the idea that Democrats are going to be asking the candidates for president, whoever they might be, ‘what did you do? Mr Galdieri said this tactic could “backfire” if Democrats decide they do not want a “Tweeter-in-chief”. Jennifer Grygiel, an associate professor at Syracuse University who specialises in memes and social media, said she did not think being anti-Trump was a winning formula. “Following Trump is a slippery slope for anyone who actually paints themselves or actually is authentically somebody who's trying to do something progressive. I can't just see politicians memeing their way into office,” they said. “I think, for better or for worse, maybe he is emerging as something that is new, but maybe not necessarily better.” Trying to outdo Mr Trump at being Mr Trump is a losing game, according to Amy Koch, a Republican strategist. I just don't know that anybody can outdo Trump, even in like, the kind of outrageous funniness of it, so I don't think it's going to be effective,” she said. “I think that, in general for independents and centre-Right people, it's just too much,” she said.</p>

VILNIUS, August 21. /TASS/. The troops that Lithuania may send to Ukraine as part of international security forces will not take part in combat operations, the Baltic nation's Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene said.

"Sending our troops to Ukraine would not be a combat mission. The contingent would not be deployed to the frontline or participate in military operations," she told the Ziniu Radijas radio station.

According to the defense chief, the deployment of troops to Ukraine requires a ceasefire and a clear US role in security forces.

Lithuanian Presidential Advisor Dainius Zikevicius said earlier this week that Vilnius was ready to take part in efforts to ensure security in Ukraine at a scale similar to the country's participation in NATO's operation in Afghanistan.

Between 2005 and 2013, Lithuania headed a NATO group for the reconstruction of Afghanistan's Ghor Province, fully funding its activities in 2007-2013. The group consisted of about 150 Lithuanian soldiers and officers, along with military and civilian experts from several other countries.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. SHUXIAN LUO is an Assistant Professor in Asian Studies at the University of Hawaii and a Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Since talks collapsed between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Hanoi, in 2019, North Korea's reckless drive for long-range nuclear capabilities has fueled tensions on the Korean Peninsula to new heights. For years, Beijing has played a crucial role in bringing North Korea to the negotiating table, and it has at times been a key partner in international efforts to curb North Korea's nuclear and missile ambitions. China has supported UN Security Council resolutions to inhibit North Korea's nuclear program and even worked with Washington to tighten sanctions against Pyongyang, despite criticism from Russia for doing so. Beijing's reserved response to Pyongyang's provision of weapons and combat troops to support Russia's war in Ukraine—dismissing it as a bilateral matter between Pyongyang and Moscow—betrays a thinly veiled discomfort with its smaller ally's latest gambit. At the same time, observers in Washington and Seoul have become hopeful that growing public support in South Korea for developing an independent nuclear deterrent might provide Beijing with another compelling reason to renew its efforts to restrain the North's belligerence. Reinvigorating joint U.S.-Chinese efforts to curb North Korea's nuclear program is indeed possible. Both great powers continue to publicly endorse some level of denuclearization. But many of the pathways recently proposed for incentivizing Beijing's cooperation rest on shaky assumptions. Despite the many historical periods of unease between the two countries, China's policy toward North Korea's nuclear program has been shaped more by its broader strategic calculations vis-à-vis the United States than by frustration with its defiant ally. History suggests the opposite: Beijing has been more, not less, likely to tighten its ties with Pyongyang when North Korea is drifting toward Moscow. In the late 1960s, for example, China deliberately strengthened its ties to North Korea in fear that Pyongyang was tilting toward the Soviet Union. Hoping that the possibility of South Korean nuclearization might spur Chinese cooperation on North Korea is equally misguided, and the prospect could even backfire. South Korea's deployment, in 2016, of the U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, for example—intended to counter North Korean missile threats—prompted sweeping economic retaliation from China. The development of a South Korean nuclear weapons program could trigger even harsher punishment—and might lead Beijing to tacitly accept further advances in North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities. The history of negotiations over North Korea's nuclear program shows that China has been more amenable to working with the United States when it feels secure about its vital interests, and no interest matters more to Beijing than preventing Taiwan's independence—an issue that U.S. policy can directly shape. By reaffirming the United States' “one China” policy and signaling a continued U.S. willingness to restrain Taipei's unilateral moves toward independence, the Trump administration could nudge Beijing toward resuming its efforts to curb Pyongyang. Above all, China fears that its unpredictable and often aggressive client state could spark a military conflict with South Korea and the United States, potentially dragging Beijing into a second Korean War. Even short of provoking outright conflict, North Korea's advancing nuclear and missile capabilities still threaten to trigger a regional arms race. The United States and its allies have already expanded missile defense deployments in East Asia, which Beijing views as a direct threat to its strategic deterrence capabilities. Beijing is also acutely aware of the risks posed by its shared border with North Korea. Pyongyang's continuing nuclear and missile developments could invite new rounds of international sanctions, potentially crippling North Korea's already fragile economy and causing a refugee crisis in northeast China. Nearly half of North Korea's known major nuclear sites lie within 30 miles of the shared border, making any nuclear mishap—whether caused by an accident in North Korean operations or a preemptive U.S. strike—a possible environmental disaster for China. For all these reasons, China has long regarded Pyongyang's nuclear program as a headache and has consistently affirmed denuclearization as a policy goal. Chinese President Xi Jinping even openly warned Pyongyang, in 2013, that “no one should be allowed to throw a region and even the whole world into chaos for selfish gains.” At times, Beijing has taken harsh measures toward North Korea—including temporarily suspending oil shipments, restricting Chinese tourism, and applying financial sanctions to the North—although such efforts have typically been short-lived and halfhearted. But North Korea also serves China's strategic interests in two important ways—both with respect to Taiwan. First, in the event of a military showdown over Taiwan, North Korea could help tie down, or at least distract, U.S. forces in the western Pacific, forcing Washington to keep a substantial number of its military assets in the Korean theater. If Beijing were ever to conclude that force was the only path to unification with Taiwan, it might be more inclined to tolerate—or even shield—North Korea's nuclear and missile programs because a nuclear-armed North Korea could, in theory, help create a more favorable strategic environment for Chinese military operations across the Taiwan Strait. Beijing has also long viewed its cooperation on the North Korean nuclear issue as a source of leverage to push for U.S. accommodation of its interests on Taiwan. Since the early 2000s, Chinese officials and strategists have made it clear, both privately and publicly, that they expect reciprocity on the two issues. But what we are saying is this: The United States cannot expect us to continually give unless it gives us something, too.” According to the political scientist Zhao Quansheng, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhou Wenzhong acknowledged to him, in 2005, that Beijing had worked with Washington on North Korean denuclearization partly to elicit U.S. cooperation on Taiwan (noting, however, that Beijing had used the linkage strategy very cautiously). In 2008, according to a U.S. diplomatic cable published by Wikileaks, Yang Jiemian—the head of the government-affiliated think tank Shanghai Institute for International Studies and brother of then Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi—suggested to senior U.S. officials that the United States could coordinate with China on the Taiwan issue in exchange for China's help restraining North Korea's nuclear ambitions. Since the early 1990s, Beijing's willingness to rein in North Korea's nuclear ambitions has followed a discernible pattern. But when the United States took steps that Beijing perceived as threatening to its position on Taiwan, China became more reluctant to cooperate—sometimes even overtly shielding the North. The first North Korean nuclear crisis erupted in 1993, when Pyongyang declared its intention to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, after facing pressure from the International Atomic Energy Agency to allow inspections of suspected nuclear sites. Beijing, still resentful of U.S. sanctions and criticism of its record on human rights, declined to formally participate in the negotiations over North Korea's nuclear program. China did not vote in favor of a UN Security Council resolution calling for North Korea to comply with IAEA safeguards, but by abstaining, it allowed the measure to pass. According to U.S. diplomats involved in the negotiations, Beijing also signaled that it would abstain from a Security Council resolution to impose limited sanctions on Pyongyang, and warned that if such sanctions were adopted, it would cut off oil and food supplies to North Korea. China did not seek U.S. assurances on Taiwan in return for its cooperation, partly because Beijing remained confident that Washington would maintain only unofficial ties with the island—but that faith would soon falter. This time, China played a far more active diplomatic role, partly because the strategic context had shifted. Beijing's latent confidence in U.S. unofficial ties with Taiwan had been shaken by the 1995–96 Taiwan Strait crisis, when Washington allowed Taiwanese leader Lee Teng-hui to visit Cornell University, where he had studied. Beijing viewed this as a breach of the U.S. pledge to conduct relations with Taiwan on a strictly unofficial basis, and responded with military drills in the Taiwan Strait. Then, in 2000, Taiwan elected Chen Shui-bian from the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as president. When, in August 2002, Chen claimed that “one country exists on each side of the Taiwan Strait” and proposed to hold a referendum on Taiwan's formal independence, Beijing became even more unsettled. During a summit with President George W. Bush in Texas that October, Chinese President Jiang Zemin urged Washington to go beyond merely “not supporting” Taiwan's independence and to explicitly “oppose” it. In December 2003, while standing next to visiting Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, Bush publicly rebuked Chen, declaring, “We oppose any unilateral decision by either China or Taiwan to change the status quo,” and warning that Chen's comments and actions indicated that “he may be willing to make decisions unilaterally to change the status quo, which we oppose.” As North Korea continued advancing its nuclear program, Beijing played a major part in the international efforts to halt and roll it back. In August 2003, Beijing helped launch the Six-Party Talks, hosting Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea, and the United States to further these efforts. When Pyongyang went ahead with the test anyway, Beijing issued a statement denouncing North Korea's action as hanran, or “blatant”—a rare and unusually strong public condemnation of its ally by Chinese standards—and temporarily suspended financial transactions between major Chinese banks and North Korea. The talks ultimately collapsed in 2009, after Pyongyang withdrew and carried out a second nuclear test. But China, reassured by Washington's stance on Taiwan, had shown a consistent willingness to pressure its longtime ally. Between 2009 and 2017, as cross-strait tensions eased, China took an even harder line on North Korea. The election of Ma Ying-jeou, from the Beijing-friendly Kuomintang party, as Taiwan's president in 2008 ushered in a period of considerably better ties between Taipei and Beijing. Worrying less about Taiwan, Beijing increasingly viewed North Korea's nuclear provocations as a threat to China's security interests rather than as an insurance policy against Taiwan's independence. Chinese strategists began openly suggesting that Beijing should abandon Pyongyang, and senior Chinese officials increasingly emphasized that Chinese–North Korean ties were “normal” state-to-state relations rather than a “blood alliance,” as they had traditionally been described. But Trump refused to grant Tsai a second call, primarily out of concern that it might derail Chinese cooperation on North Korea, likely helping sustain Beijing's willingness to continue exerting pressure Pyongyang through 2017. During Trump's first term, a bipartisan consensus emerged in Washington favoring a tougher policy toward China, which, as Beijing continued escalating pressure on Taipei, also meant strengthening relations with Taiwan. In March, just days after the White House announced Trump's summit with Kim and after Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encouraged exchanges between U.S. and Taiwanese officials, Xi hosted Kim in Beijing for his first visit to China. That September, Beijing sent Li Zhanshu, the Chinese Communist Party's number three official, to attend North Korea's founding day military parade. To be sure, China's abrupt shift was also driven by its concern that a breakthrough in U.S.–North Korean relations could marginalize China on the Korean Peninsula. As U.S.-Chinese tensions over Taiwan ratcheted up in 2019 and 2020—fueled by growing Chinese pressure on the island, major U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, and multiple high-level U.S. officials' visits to Taipei—Beijing grew more overt in its support for Pyongyang, even as North Korea resumed missile tests and refused diplomatic engagement with the United States. In June 2019, Xi visited North Korea for the first time as China's leader. China's support for North Korea peaked early in the Biden administration, as Beijing perceived Washington's posture to be increasingly confrontational, particularly on Taiwan. President Joe Biden's repeated off-the-cuff remarks suggesting a U.S. commitment to Taiwan's defense in the event of a Chinese attack, although consistently walked back by administration officials, further alarmed Chinese leaders. When Pyongyang intensified its missile testing in the spring of 2022—including the launch of three ballistic missiles capable of reaching the continental United States—China, along with Russia, vetoed a U.S.-proposed UN Security Council resolution calling for additional sanctions against Pyongyang. This marked China's first and only veto, to date, of a resolution targeting North Korea, and it came just three days after Biden made remarks suggesting, for the third time, that the United States had an obligation to defend Taiwan. In August, Pyongyang returned the favor by condemning U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, echoing Beijing's outrage. (He also refrained from repeating his earlier remarks about U.S. commitments to Taiwan's defense.) This more cautious approach continued through the trilateral summit at Camp David, in August 2023, where the United States, Japan, and South Korea issued a joint statement reaffirming that there was “no change in our basic positions on Taiwan” and urged a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues. In response to Taiwan's election of the DPP presidential candidate Lai Ching-te in January 2024, whom Beijing views as a staunch advocate of Taiwan's independence, Biden pronounced, “We do not support independence.” The State Department further emphasized the U.S. commitment to advancing the unofficial U.S.-Taiwanese relationship in a way consistent with its “one China” policy. Pyongyang responded furiously, calling the statement a “grave political provocation.” Even with Beijing's recent distancing from North Korea, and Washington's reaffirmation of its position on Taiwan, the risk of miscalculation over either issue remains dangerously high—high enough that the United States and China could be dragged into a direct military confrontation. A conflict in the Taiwan Strait or on the Korean Peninsula—or worse, in both—could quickly spiral into a broader war with devastating global consequences. To mitigate this risk, some analysts have proposed that the United States should seek a “grand bargain” with China. According to this view, Washington could make major concessions on Taiwan, such as explicitly ruling out military intervention in the event of a crisis in Taiwan, in exchange for Beijing's accommodation of U.S. interests on issues such as North Korea, the South China Sea, and trade. As both Beijing's experience dealing with Pyongyang and, to a lesser extent, Washington's experience with Taipei demonstrate, these smaller partners are not mere pawns to be traded away. They can act unilaterally in ways that complicate their patrons' strategic goals. Some analysts argue that China and the United States should base negotiations on single issues, instead of chasing an ambitious but unlikely grand bargain. Rather than choosing between these extremes, Washington should pursue a middle path: a focused effort to work with Beijing to manage and reduce military risks on the Korean Peninsula and in the Taiwan Strait. Such a cross-issue bargaining approach would offer a higher chance of success than single-issue negotiations because it creates possibilities for side deals that would be unattainable were the bargaining to remain confined to a single issue area. To that end, the United States should leverage China's willingness to rein in North Korea when it feels secure about its vital interests, especially Taiwan. China, for its part, should consider easing its military, economic, and diplomatic pressure campaigns against Taiwan—steps that would not only lower cross-strait tensions and advance Beijing's stated goal of peaceful unification, by appealing to the “hearts and minds” of the Taiwanese people, but also better protect Washington from domestic criticism of its efforts to reassure Beijing on the Taiwan issue. At the same time, China should press North Korea, even if only in private, to refrain from new nuclear tests, suspend intercontinental ballistic missile launches, scale back short-range missile tests, and reengage in dialogue with the new South Korean government to reduce hostilities and military tensions. If Pyongyang were to meet these conditions, Washington should, in coordination with Seoul and Beijing, consider calibrated steps toward diplomatic reengagement with North Korea and limited sanctions relief. This middle ground approach is more politically feasible than a grand bargain—in both Washington and Bejing—because it would not demand a fundamental shift in either side's long-standing policy toward its respective smaller partner. Precisely because of those limits, such a framework would be brittle. Pyongyang and Taipei are autonomous actors, capable of resisting pressure by their patrons and of taking action to force their patrons' hands. Sustaining cooperation will also require that the United States and China remain dedicated to a narrowly focused joint effort. If the United States hopes to constrain North Korea's nuclear program, it will need at least tacit support from China—and ideally, Beijing's active cooperation. Progress will not be linear, but there is precedent for it. A joint risk control and reduction framework would not be a perfect solution to the underlying disputes over North Korea and Taiwan, but it could function as a stabilizing guardrail, minimizing the risk of escalatory spirals and creating space for leaders to explore more durable security arrangements for the region.
