                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Matthew Stafford's back issue has sparked some bizarre theories. The Rams' veteran quarterback missed preseason action and most of training camp due to lingering back soreness — for which he's received epidurals to manage pain — and his wife, Kelly Stafford, is taking speculation over his health in stride. Taking to her Instagram Story on Thursday, Kelly reposted a Barstool Sports headline that read, “The Best NFL conspiracy theory on the internet – Matthew Stafford died a couple weeks ago, got cloned, new one is now QB1 for the Rams.” She added, “I knew there was something different about him….that @ammortal_official is wild.” Kelly tagged Ammortal Inc, a company that her husband uses for their Ammortal Chamber, which is “the fastest way to reset, recharge and rejuvenate the body, mind and spirit,” according to its website. Stafford returned to the field Monday for the first time this summer for practice in full pads. Rams head coach Sean McVay told reporters after practice that Stafford participated in 26 plays of team drills, per the team's official website. I don't really have any updates,” McVay said. We'll see how this afternoon goes and tomorrow.” Ammortal advertises itself as a "wellness device that aims to optimize human performance and promote holistic health through a combination of non-invasive technologies." If Stafford isn't ready for Week 1 against the Texans, veteran backup Jimmy Garoppolo would be the starter. Stetson Bennett, who shined in preseason, is next up on the depth chart.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>James is a published author with four pop-history and science books to his name. He specializes in history, strange science, and anything out of the ordinary. Katy is Managing Editor at IFLScience where she oversees editorial content from News articles to Features, and even occasionally writes some. It helps that planets tend to orbit on roughly the same plane. We are a little short on data on alien civilizations, given that we have found a grand total of zero in our century of searching. As such, researchers have attempted to look at our own signatures of intelligence and how they propagate across the cosmos. "Previous studies have proposed various kinds of radio technosignatures emitted by humankind, assessed their detectability, and have often described the search for these technosignatures as searching for 'Earth-level civilizations'," the team explains in their new paper, adding that studies have found that the most detectable of our signals come from intermittent, celestially targeted radio transmissions, and persistent, celestially targeted radio transmissions. However, these transmissions are highly sporadic in timing and directionality. By contrast, persistent, celestially targeted radio transmissions include much more frequent transmissions between ground stations and deep-space spacecraft, such as those from the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN)." This is a network of antennas used to communicate with spacecraft, including the furthest spacecraft from Earth, currently over 25 million kilometers (15.5 million miles) away. According to the team, if aliens use similar methods to communicate with their own probes in their solar systems, this could significantly improve our chances of detecting a stray alien signal, because it gives us some precise places to look. “Humans are predominantly communicating with the spacecraft and probes we have sent to study other planets like Mars,” Pinchen Fan, graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at the Penn State Eberly College of Science, and first author of the paper, explained in a statement. “But a planet like Mars does not block the entire transmission, so a distant spacecraft or planet positioned along the path of these interplanetary communications could potentially detect the spillover; that would occur when Earth and another solar system planet align from their perspective. But in this case, we might not have to wait for a supernova event, and should instead try and observe exoplanets around other stars when they are nicely aligned with Earth's telescopes. “It sends some of humanity's strongest and most persistent radio signals into space, and the public logs of its transmissions allowed our team to establish the temporal and spatial patterns of those transmissions for the past 20 years.” ”Based on data from the last 20 years, we found that if an extraterrestrial intelligence were in a location that could observe the alignment of Earth and Mars, there's a 77% chance that they would be in the path of one of our transmissions — orders of magnitude more likely than being in a random position at a random time," Fan explained. “If they could view an alignment with another solar system planet, there is a 12% chance they would be in the path of our transmissions. When not observing a planet alignment, however, these chances are minuscule.” In this instance, the universe (or gravitational interactions) does appear to be giving us a little help. With a few oddball exceptions, planets in mature systems tend to orbit within a fairly narrow plane around their host stars, making alignment much more probable than if they were to orbit in random orientations. The team suggests that by looking for planetary alignments around other stars, we could significantly increase our chances of detecting stray alien signals. The team is now planning to identify exoplanet systems that are "edge on" to our own Solar System's plane, and figure out how frequently they could have received signals as we communicate with our spacecraft. “Because we are only starting to detect a lot of exoplanets in the last decade or two, we do not know many systems with two or more transiting exoplanets,” Fan added. “With the upcoming launch of NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, we expect to detect a hundred thousand previously undetected exoplanets, so our potential search area should increase greatly.” NASA and others are already experimenting with potential laser transmissions. If aliens do the same and are successful, these are much less prone to "spilling" their signal out for all behind the target to see. It could be that communication using radio waves is only very brief on astronomical timescales, if aliens use it to communicate with their own spacecraft at all. But, with no obvious signs of life out there in a vast galaxy, this could certainly be a way of narrowing down where to look.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>His story, though hotly disputed, has become one of the most influential accounts in UFO history. In 1989, he came forward in an interview with journalist George Knapp, claiming he worked at a secret facility near Area 51 known as S-4. His story, though hotly disputed, has become one of the most influential accounts in UFO history. Lazar alleged that the US government was concealing nine alien spacecraft in underground hangars carved into a mountain near Groom Lake. He insisted these were not experimental human aircraft but genuine extraterrestrial technology. Perhaps Lazar's most famous claim concerned the fuel source of these crafts: Element 115. At the time, this element was unknown to science. Lazar said the alien technology relied on a stable isotope of 115 that enabled powerful energy generation and anti-gravity effects. Years later, scientists synthesised a new element, now called Moscovium (element 115), though only in unstable forms lasting fractions of a second. The coincidence keeps Lazar's account alive in UFO circles, despite scepticism. Lazar explained that the propulsion system did not rely on rockets or jets, but on the ability to manipulate gravity itself. He described a 'gravity drive' that bent space-time around the craft, allowing instantaneous changes in direction and extraordinary speeds. Such technology, he argued, made traditional aerodynamics irrelevant and explained why UFOs could perform manoeuvres impossible for human aircraft. Central to Lazar's testimony was his allegation of a massive government cover-up. He claimed that scientists at S-4 were kept isolated from one another, limiting their knowledge of the overall project. Supporters argue that this alleged intimidation only reinforces his credibility, suggesting authorities wanted to silence him. References to S-4, gravity propulsion, and Element 115 are now staples of conspiracy discussions. To critics, he is a fabricator whose story collapses under scrutiny. Either way, his claims continue to resonate, raising questions about what secrets might lie hidden in the Nevada desert.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment. Psychologists have long considered how a tendency towards irrational thinking or particular  personality traits might predict peoples' interest in conspiracies. Yet these individual factors do not explain the group processes through which conspiracy theorists are extending their influence and impact. Over five years, we sought out and got to know people on the cusp of becoming conspiracy theorists. Indeed, contrary to the stereotype of isolated keyboard warriors who have gone down the rabbit hole, conspiracy theorists are becoming organised, recruiting supporters, picketing vaccination centres and vandalising telecommunication and traffic infrastructures. Our research examined the growing interest in conspiracy theories and how associated activism emerges. But revealing our status as researchers actually allowed us to build relationships with people, who shared insights into what motivates their involvement. In particular, we spoke to people about conspiracy theories concerning 5G technology, COVID-19, 15-minute cities and low-traffic neighbourhoods. Belief in conspiracy theories is often initiated by traumatic life events. And these emotions can motivate a search for answers. These are moments of insight during which people come to believe that the causes of their problems lie with secretive groups which control society. One person we spoke to described conspiracy theories as enabling him to “access the way the world really works… as if a light was switched on in my head and I could see things clearly”. In online group chats, people discover others with similar problems. In public meetings, beliefs in various theories are boosted by interactions where people discuss their suspicions over who is to blame for particular issues. In the process, these groups feed off their common emotions, building an atmosphere of energy and excitement. As one participant put it, “there's a lot of support out there for people who are doing their own research… there is always someone wanting to hear more, building on the work of others, giving each other support. Conspiracy theories don't merely offer alternative explanations for events, they are resources for communities that provide identity, purpose and belonging. These benefits may explain why it is so difficult to talk people out of their beliefs in conspiracy theories. Indeed, when conspiracy communities generate common interpretations and shared emotions, conspiracy theories can resonate powerfully, making them seem more real than they are. The internet serves as a vast database where conspiracy theorists can discover articles, documents and scientific reports to support their claims. And despite the questionable quality of many such sources, contributing to conspiracy theories can provide a boost to people's self esteem, making them feel like experts and heroic detectives. A key aspect of these communities is how they empower members to contribute. Yet, beyond generating more theories, conspiracy communities are becoming organised networks for protest and activism. Given that conspiracy theories raise suspicion and anger over peoples' problems, and point the blame at particular targets, we found that believers can feel compelled to take part in protests. For example, some claim that the urban planning concept of 15-minute cities is part of secretive government scheme to limit citizens' movement. Protesters against these and other efforts to improve urban environments are uniting under slogans such as “stop the tyranny”. Activism based on conspiracy theories can come with serious risks. Many of those involved lose contact with family and friends. Moreover, when conspiracy theorists take action without tested evidence, they may misidentify targets. Perhaps the real winners here are the conspiracy entrepreneurs – people who capitalise on conspiracy theories by creating content that heightens peoples' suspicions about problematic events.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American filmmaker Michael Chaves didn't just direct The Conjuring: Last Rites—he lived through a haunting of his own while making it. “When talking about making these movies, the question that always comes up is ‘Did anything spooky ever happen on set?' And my answer now is ‘Yes,'” Chaves said. “My experiences on (the sets of) The Conjuring: Last Rites have made me a believer. They're totally honest, reasonable, smart people, and this was something that was really a wound that they dealt with. It resonated with me incredibly," he added. But it's the second thing, that is sure to send some shivers down the spine. “While shooting in England, I swear to God I was living in a haunted house. It was called The Old Vicarage—one of those places that doesn't even have an address, just a name. And though I usually would go for a small place, I had my family with me, so we wound up at The Old Vicarage. It was called that because vicars, when they came to town and were working at the church, would reside there. The place was probably a couple hundred years old,” Michael recalled. The director went on to describe chilling moments in the house, from his daughter's iPad photo that seemed to capture a shadowy priest to hearing two men's voices upstairs when he was home alone. I search from one room to the next… and there is no one in that house—and the voices suddenly stop,” Chaves said. I know that something was there. It happened to me,” he added. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson return as Ed and Lorraine Warren, facing a case that threatens not just their faith but their family itself.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a new study, researchers from Penn State and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory analyzed human deep space communications and found that human transmissions are frequently directed toward our own spacecrafts near Mars (lower left), the sun, and other planets. If an extraterrestrial intelligence were looking for signs of human communications, when and where should they look? In a new study, researchers at Penn State and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California analyzed when and where human deep space transmissions would be most detectable by an observer outside our solar system and suggest that the patterns they see could be used to guide our own search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). "But a planet like Mars does not block the entire transmission, so a distant spacecraft or planet positioned along the path of these interplanetary communications could potentially detect the spillover; that would occur when Earth and another solar system planet align from their perspective. "Considering the direction and frequency of our most common signals gives insights into where we should be looking to improve our chances of detecting alien technosignatures." The researchers analyzed logs from NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN), a system of ground-based facilities that permits two-way radio communications with human-made objects in space, acting as a relay to send commands to spacecraft and receive information they send back. "It sends some of humanity's strongest and most persistent radio signals into space, and the public logs of its transmissions allowed our team to establish the temporal and spatial patterns of those transmissions for the past 20 years." For this study, the researchers focused on transmissions to deep space, including transmissions to telescopes in space as well as interplanetary spacecraft, instead of transmissions intended for spacecraft or satellites in low-Earth orbit, which are relatively low power and would be difficult to detect from a distance. The researchers found that deep space radio signals were predominantly directed toward spacecraft near Mars. "Based on data from the last 20 years, we found that if an extraterrestrial intelligence were in a location that could observe the alignment of Earth and Mars, there's a 77% chance that they would be in the path of one of our transmissions—orders of magnitude more likely than being in a random position at a random time," Fan said. When not observing a planet alignment, however, these chances are minuscule." To improve our own search for technosignatures, the researchers said, humans should look for alignment of exoplanets—planets outside our solar system—or at least when exoplanets align with their host star. Astronomers frequently study exoplanets during alignment with their host star. "However, because we are only starting to detect a lot of exoplanets in the last decade or two, we do not know many systems with two or more transiting exoplanets," Fan said. "With the upcoming launch of NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, we expect to detect a hundred thousand previously undetected exoplanets, so our potential search area should increase greatly." The research team also calculated that an average DSN transmission could be detected about 23 light-years away using telescopes like ours. Focusing efforts, they said, on solar systems that are within 23 light-years and especially whose plane is oriented with its edge toward Earth could improve our search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The team now plans to identify these systems and quantify how frequently they could have received signals coming from Earth. The DSN transmission patterns found could also be applied to searches for laser transmissions from exoplanets, the researchers said, though they noted that lasers would have much less spillover than radio transmission. NASA is testing its interplanetary laser communication system, and extraterrestrial civilizations may opt to use lasers instead of radio waves. "Humans are pretty early in our spacefaring journey, and as we reach further into our solar system, our transmissions to other planets will only increase," said Jason Wright, professor of astronomy and astrophysics in the Penn State Eberly College of Science, director of the Penn State Extraterrestrial Intelligence Center, and an author of the paper. "Using our own deep space communications as a baseline, we quantified how future searchers for extraterrestrial intelligence could be improved by focusing on systems with particular orientations and planet alignments."

An unidentified flying object reportedly crashed and exploded in a cornfield in eastern Poland early on Wednesday, according to the country's news agency PAP.

Local police received reports around 2 a.m., finding burned metal and plastic debris near Osiny village. The explosion shattered windows in some homes, though no injuries were reported.

Despite the incident, Poland's Armed Forces Operational Command stated on social media that no violations of Polish airspace from neighbouring Ukraine or Belarus were recorded overnight.

Officials initially said the explosion may have been caused by a part of an old engine with a propeller.

Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz later said the object was most likely a drone, adding that an analysis was underway to determine whether it was a military or smuggling one, PAP reported.

Lublin District Prosecutor Grzegorz Trusiewicz told reporters several investigators — both civilian and military — were examining the crash site.

“We have a lot of manpower, we have the army to help us. I hope that we will be able to finish the operation by the evening," Trusiewicz said.

Since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago, there have been a number of intrusions into Polish airspace, raising alarm in the European Union and NATO member state and reminding people how close the war is.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elizabeth Klarer wtih a bust of her intergalactic lover, Akon. As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas - the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth - it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved. Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959. These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas - bigger than Mount Everest - hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as "not natural". This image from NASA shows the fast-moving interstellar object that has got many to wonder about alien encounters that have been reported over the years. It was first picked up by a telescope in Chile and then photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope a few weeks ago. Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University thinks the visitor is unlikely to be a natural object and believes governments around the world should formulate a treaty so they know how to handle a possible hostile alien invasion. For her, it was all about peace, love and understanding - things she tried to convey from her lover from the planet Meton in the Alpha Centauri System, according to earlier reports by "Independent Media". Klarer, who was a meteorologist, claimed to have had the most intimate encounter with extraterrestrials, writing in her book "Beyond the Light Barrier", published in 1980, that she bore a son with her alien lover, Akon. This time, Akon took her aboard his scout ship, a craft some 18 m in diameter, before transporting her to the cigar-shaped mother ship. He also claimed that several Venusians were living among us. In 1959, Klarer claimed she visited Meton with Akon, orbiting Proxima Centauri, where she gave birth to their son, Ayling, before returning to Earth because the planet's vibrations played havoc with her heart. Klarer's main thrust throughout her life, and in the pages of her book, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilisation. Klarer often commemorated the April 7 anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill, sometimes aided by others as she grew frail. When this reporter covered Klarer's funeral in Pietermaritzburg in February 1994, her sisters expressed profound loss, but were also at peace now that her battle against scepticism had come to an end. Betty and Barney Hill claimed they were abducted by aliens in 1961 while returning home from a visit to Niagara Falls. They were on their way home from a trip to Niagara Falls when they saw a string of bright lights in the sky. The couple claimed that they were rendered unconscious by a group of humanoids who approached them when Barney got out of the family car, armed with his pistol, soon after a craft, measuring 12 meters across, blocked their path. What they did recall was waking up not far from the car. After the troubling incident, Betty drew a star map which closely resembles actual star placements which were only discovered by astronomers a decade later, indicating that their alleged abductors had come from Zeta Reticuli. Media coverage turned the Hills into celebrities, spawning a 1975 made-for-television film starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons. Betty's subsequent dreams showed a strong correlation with details Barney shared under hypnosis. However, in both cases, there was never enough evidence to conclusively prove their abduction story, nor to disprove it as a mere fiction. An ominous interstellar object named 3I/Atlas is hurtling towards our solar system at astonishing speeds. What does this mean for Earth, and could it be a sign of extraterrestrial …</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The theory has inspired multiple extremist attacks, including the 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and a shooting at a Buffalo, New York, grocery store in 2022. He said it was “real” and “already being put into effect in some European cities.” On that episode, which aired in April 2021, he argued that the theory was not antisemitic, saying, “Literally no one blames this on Jews.” Lendrum's past comments — made on podcasts, in columns and on social media — were first reported this week by Notus, an independent news outlet covering the government. The site noted that while Lendrum's digital output was vast, his audience appeared to be relatively small. His X account, to which he has limited visibility to his 450 followers after Notus' report, follows 88 accounts — a number that is widely understood to be a white supremacist code representing “Heil Hitler.” Other figures accused of antisemitism in the past have followed just 88 accounts despite using the platform frequently. The Notus report adds Lendrum to a growing list of Trump administration hires, drawn from a vast far-right media ecosystem, who have promoted antisemitic rhetoric and ideas. It comes at a time when his department has posted social media content that appears to contain antisemitic dogwhistles. The department's website suggests that speechwriters are not responsible for social media posts. The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Lendrum's past comments. Before being hired at DHS in March, according to his LinkedIn profile, Lendrum wrote for the right-wing site American Greatness and worked as an associate producer for the radio show hosted by Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump advisor who was accused of having sworn allegiance to a Hungarian Nazi group. According to the DHS Office of Public Affairs' website, Lendrum's duties as a speechwriter include preparing “speeches, talking points, editorials, Congressional testimony, video scripts, web content and other written content for the Secretary and Deputy Secretary.” Other Trump administration hires with records of promoting extremist ideas include Kingsley Wilson, who was appointed as the Pentagon press secretary in May, has repeatedly echoed antisemitic rhetoric online, sparking criticism from the House Jewish Caucus. The appointment of Darren Beattie as the acting under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs in February also drew criticism for his track record of consorting with white supremacists and hawking conspiracy theories.
