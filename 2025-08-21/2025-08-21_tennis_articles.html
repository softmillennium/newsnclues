                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sachia Vickery discusses OnlyFans account and $1,000 date deposit as she competed for a spot in the US Open this week. As they say, time is money, and if you want some of emerging tennis star Sachia Vickery's time off the court, be prepared to spend big. “I'm very open-minded and I don't care what people think of me,” Vickery said, per The Daily Mail, of any criticism she may face for her OnlyFans. According to the New York Post, she added that she would never “talk s—” about OnlyFans girls again because “the amount I made on there in my first two days, I am overwhelmed. A rep for the tennis player told People magazine that while Vickery posts “suggestive” content on the platform and despite reports made by other publications, what she does on OnlyFans “should not be considered ‘sex work. The statement clarified that Vickery doesn't post full nudity or sexual acts and that she pursued the platform after taking six months off for an injury. “Tennis was not stopped to go into OnlyFans,” the rep said. “I no longer date for free due to the behavior of men. I now require a pre-date deposit; send me $1,000, and we can make it happen. My Cash App is $Sachiavick,” she said, per The Daily Mail. She later followed up with another post that featured her dancing in a bikini set to a Jessie Reyez song, doubling down on the pre-date deposit. “Imagine hating me and I'm in my room like this everyday,” she wrote. She was a standout junior player, winning the USTA Junior National Championship in 2013, and went on to reach a career-high ranking of world No. Her headline-making comments came as she battled for a spot in the main draw at this year's U.S. Open.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There will be no shortage of high-profile American women at this US Open. Thursday's draw in New York revealed that half of the projected quarterfinalists -- No. 8 Amanda Anisimova -- will be playing a home game in the season's last Grand Slam. If the seeds hold, Gauff and Keys -- two of the three major champions already crowned this year -- would meet in a sizzling quarterfinal. Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka was drawn into the same quarter as No. 7 Jasmine Paolini, setting up a potential showdown, while Iga Swiatek -- fresh off her Cincinnati title -- could see a rematch of the Wimbledon final against Anisimova. We break down the draw: Beyond these top seeds, this section includes some of the hottest players this summer. 9 Elena Rybakina just reached the semifinals at the Cincinnati Open, losing to eventual champion Iga Swiatek in a 7-5, 6-3 thriller. 14 Clara Tauson, a semifinalist in Montreal, meets ascendant Filipina Alexandra Eala in a first-round match. 24 Veronika Kudermetova, who reached the final four in Cincinnati, is on a collision course for a third-round meeting with Rybakina. 31 Leylah captured the title at the Mubadala Citi DC Open and could meet Sabalenka in the third round. Two former junior standouts have a date in the US Open first round ✨ pic.twitter.com/9zIyMAFGQo Less than a month ago, 18-year-old Canadian Victoria Mboko was No. 85 in the PIF WTA Rankings. But after winning each of her seven matches at the Canadian Open, she rocketed into the Top 25 -- and secured seeding at the US Open. 22, but that didn't shield her from a dangerous path. She plays two-time Grand Slam champion Barbora Krejcikova in the first round and could see No. 10 Emma Navarro in the third. In a first-round match, No. 5 Andreeva draws Alycia Parks who just upset Navarro to reach the quarterfinals in Monterrey, Mexico. Two of the three leading active Grand Slam champions reside in this section. Forty-five-year-old wild card Venus Williams has a first-round match against No. When she won her semifinal match over Elina Svitolina in Montreal, Osaka was thrilled that she'd be seeded in New York, where she won two of her four majors. She'll meet Greet Minnen in a first-round match. Playing the last Grand Slam of her career, wild card Caroline Garcia meets Kamilla Rakhimova. After winning the singles title in Cincinnati, Swiatek flew to New York and, with  less than a 12-hour turnaround, advanced with Casper Ruud to the mixed doubles semifinals on Tuesday. After beating top-seeded Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper in the final four, Swiatek and Ruud fell in the final to Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori. Swiatek's path in singles seems less daunting. After a first-round match against Emiliana Arango, she could meet two wild cards -- Valerie Glozman in the second round and, in the third, Clervie Ngounoue. Dangerous floaters in this sector: Danielle Collins, Maria Sakkari and Maya Joint.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There was a familiar winner of the US Open mixed doubles title, with Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori retaining their title after the controversial revamp. Jannik Sinner is the defending men's champion, but fears about the Italian's fitness have grown in recent days, after he pulled out of Sunday's Cincinnati Open final. Players at the US Open have been warned about 'sex-crazed bugs' which are expected to wreak havoc at Flushing Meadows. It will take place in the middle of their mating season, leading to a potential problem for organisers. Emma Raducanu and Jack Draper will face qualifiers or lucky losers in their opening matches at the US Open. Katie Boulter will play Marta Kostyuk in her opening match while Sonay Kartal will go up against Beatriz Haddad Maia. Cameron Norrie was also handed a tricky draw, with the 29-year-old set to face Sebastian Korda in the first round. Jacob Fearnley, meanwhile, will begin his campaign against Spanish veteran Roberto Bautista Agut. The likes of Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic have also learned their fate after today's draw. It's almost time for the US Open singles draw, when the world's top players will discover their path to glory. The likes of Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic will be hoping for a kind draw as they go in search of Grand Slam success. There is also plenty of British interest with Jack Draper and Emma Raducanu the main flagbearers in the singles events. The controversial Aussie has dealt with a string of injury problems in recent seasons. He has only played five singles matches this year, winning one and losing the other four. Here's what Jannik Sinner said about his early withdrawal. Speaking after Monday's disappointing showing, he said: “Didn't feel great from yesterday. “That's the reason why I went on the court, but it was not meant to be for me today. And, but another way, I don't want to take anything away from Carlos. And yeah, now recovery is the most important. Rick Macci has praised Coco Gauff for partnering with biomechanical expert Gavin MacMillan. Writing on X, he said: “Cori Gauff just made the best decision in his life for Coco. By hiring Gavin MacMillan this can be solved real quick and make her serve click. What she hears will be 100% different than anything in the past. I saw the modifications biomechanically he did with Sabalenka on her serve and he rewired everything from start to finish. Darren Cahill has confirmed he expects Jannik Sinner to be okay for the US Open. He said: “Jannik suffered from a virus that forced him to retire against Alcaraz on Monday. He's feeling a bit better now, he will rest today [Wednesday], that is the plan and hopefully Thursday he can get out on the court and start hitting some balls. We are confident he's going to be fine.” Jessica Pegula has revealed she isn't expecting to be followed back by Jack Draper on Instagram. I realised you follow like five people or something. Andrea Vavassori has spoken of his pride after he and partner Sara Errani won the US Open mixed doubles event. He said: “We showed today that doubles is a great product. I think in the future we need more marketing and visibility. "I think this product is something that can also work in the future. It was amazing to play on this court with so many people. I prefer playing on a big court in front of people. Having previously called the event an exhibition, he went back on his original verdict, adding: "[On Tuesday] there were times where it felt a little bit more that way from our opponents. Carlos Alcaraz has been trolled by tennis star Danielle Collins. Alcaraz partnered Emma Raducanu at the recent US Open mixed doubles event. A joke that Raducanu was carrying the five-time Grand Slam winner on her back! Sara Errani didn't hold back after securing the mixed doubles title with partner Andrea Vavassori at the US Open. It comes after a controversial format change to allow the big-hitters of the ATP and WTA Tours to compete. Speaking afterwards, Errani said: "I think this one is for all the doubles players that couldn't play this tournament. I think this one is also for them." It was a bright and early start (or late night!) That gets underway in a couple of days, but will Jannik Sinner be involved?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz's bid for a second US Open crown could run through a blockbuster semi-final showdown with Novak Djokovic. Fresh from his title run in Cincinnati, Alcaraz will start his campaign at the hard-court major against big-serving American Reilly Opelka, it was revealed following Thursday's draw. In the last four, the 2022 US Open champion could meet four-time winner Djokovic, who first plays #NextGenATP Learner Tien. Seventh seed Djokovic has not competed since reaching the semi-finals at Wimbledon five weeks ago. Top seed and defending champion Jannik Sinner, who is chasing a third major title of the season, opens his campaign against Czech Vit Kopriva. The Briton opens against a qualifier or lucky loser. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Sinner is on a semi-final collision course with third seed Alexander Zverev. The three-time major finalist, who fell to Sinner in this year's Australian Open championship match, begins against Alejandro Tabilo. Alcaraz may run a gauntlet of high-calibre opposition to make it through his quarter, which features former US Open champion Daniil Medvedev, recent Toronto winner Ben Shelton and 2022 runner-up Casper Ruud. Alexei Popyrin, who last year stunned reigning champion Djokovic, is a potential second-round opponent. The 10th-seeded Lorenzo Musetti, who is currently ninth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and aiming to debut at the Nitto ATP Finals, starts against 6' 8” Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard. Last year's finalist Taylor Fritz has fallen in Djokovic's quarter, which includes three young stars who all competed in last year's Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. As well as Djokovic's first-round opponent Tien, Joao Fonseca, who won the 2023 US Open boys' singles title, plays Miomir Kecmanovic and 28th seed Alex Michelsen faces Francisco Comesana. The 22-year-old Spaniard arrives with a Tour-leading 54 wins and six titles in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Van de Zandschulp could cause 11th seed Holger Rune problems in their first-round clash. Alexander Bublik will face 2014 champion Marin Cilic in his first appearance of the North American hard-court swing, while Sebastian Korda begins against Cameron Norrie.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz will enter the US Open as the heavy favorites to win. Novak Djokovic is the last player other than them to win a Major (beat Daniil Medvedev at the 2023 US Open). This season, Sinner beat Alexander Zverev in straight sets in the Australian Open final, lost the French Open by the smallest of margin against Alcaraz, who couldn't repeat the same when they met in the Wimbledon final. Last year, he stopped Taylor Fritz from ending the American men's title drought in the home Slam with a straight-set win. If I had to pick a favourite, I would pick Jannik Sinner, because I think that there's less of a chance that he loses early in the tournament than it is for Carlos Alcaraz. Alcaraz has improved his head-to-head lead over the 24-year-old to 9-5 after their match in the Cincinnati Masters final. Sinner was forced to withdraw in the first set as he was suffering from flu. So, he doesn't really lose to players that are lower rank. After failing to win his Cincinnati title, Sinner withdrew from the revamped mixed doubles event at the US Open. But Alcaraz, in less than 24 hours after his Cincinnati match, played his first mixed doubles match alongside Emma Raducanu. During his fourth-round match at the Australian Open this year against Holger Rune, Jannik Sinner suffered from a sickness and even sparked controversy by taking an 11-minute medical timeout. Last year in the Wimbledon quarterfinal, Sinner battled sickness and eventually lost to Daniil Medvedev in five sets. After his withdrawal from the Cincinnati Masters due to sickness, Italian tennis commentator Guido Monaco observed one thing when Sinner is sick. Monaco thinks Sinner struggles in certain conditions, and he also pointed out the South Tyrol native often touches his upper stomach when he deals with some kind of sickness. I'm fine with that, it makes him more human. Sinner will now hope to recover completely before the US Open singles main draw, which starts on August 24th. If he fails to defend the title, he could lose his No.1 ranking to Carlos Alcaraz if the five-time champion adds the US Open to his trophy cabinet. The 22-year-old has so far played eight finals this season, lifting six titles, including at the French Open. Sinner has so far reached five championship matches and lifted titles at the Australian Open and at Wimbledon and lost the matches at the Italian Open, French Open, and Cincinnati Masters, all to Alcaraz.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ESPN's Patrick McEnroe said he would be “shocked if the Australian Open doesn't do it in the beginning of next year.” However, he does not feel the same about the All-England Club instituting such a change. He said, “I'd also be shocked if Wimbledon does it because we know how Wimbledon works. They're a lot about the tradition” (Newark STAR-LEDGER, 8/21). McEnroe added, “For the most part, [mixed doubles] doesn't sell any tickets. Now you've got an event that absolutely does generate revenue.” McEnroe: “You can't argue with the fan interest. We're competing not just with other sports but entertainment vehicles. I think it's been -- I'd call it a home run if I was in baseball, but I'll call it ‘four aces in a row' for the U.S. Open and for tennis in general” (Rob Schaefer, SBJ). U.S. OPEN SEEN AS A SUCCESS: Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, the only true doubles team in the draw, last night defeated Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud to claim the mixed doubles championship. At the conclusion of the match, McEnroe noted the atmosphere around the event was a “lot different this year with the almost sold-out crowd here inside Arthur Ashe Stadium.” He noted there was a “lot of hoopla about this new event” and claimed that it was “certainly a big success for the USTA and for tennis in general.” ESPN's Mary Joe Fernandez said, “I loved every minute of it. Tennis journalist Ben Rothenberg writes the U.S. Open “stuck the landing on its U.S. Open mixed doubles extravaganza, packing the massive Arthur Ashe Stadium full of fans for a night session of an event that had consistently drawn paltry crowds for decades prior.” The USTA essentially made “something out of nothing by revamping the format completely to showcase star players who can fill arenas” (BENROTHENBERG.com, 8/21).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2025 US Open is off to a great start, with the newly reimagined mixed doubles event proving to be a success. Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori clinched the title in the revamped tournament after defeating Casper Ruud and Iga Swiatek in front of a packed Arthur Ashe Stadium. As defending champions, Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka look to go back-to-back in New York, the fourth and final Grand Slam of the year marks the end of the road for one WTA star. Earlier this summer, two-time Grand Slam champion Petra Kvitova announced her retirement from professional tennis, stating the US Open would be her last tour-level event. Speaking to the Guardian ahead of the tournament, Kvitova said: “You still remember how you played before, how everything was smooth, and I was hitting winners, and suddenly it's not there. I just want to spend more time with him as well.” I played in the final of the Australian Open [in 2019], I lost to Naomi Osaka when she played incredibly in the third set. “There are always a few question marks in the number of grand slams. Being world No 1, that's what I'm missing. “Probably that's the thing I would love to have. During her career on the WTA Tour, Kvitova won 31 titles, two of which came on the biggest stage in tennis. Three years later, she completed the feat again, overcoming recently retired Eugenie Bouchard in dominant fashion to secure her second crown at the All England Club. Outside of her heroics in South West London, Kvitova won the 2011 WTA Finals and earned an Olympic bronze medal at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Top men's tennis players were shielded from more than 162,000 social media comments containing “severe” abuse during the first year of the artificial intelligence-powered ATP Safe Sport initiative, the sport's governing body has announced. The abusive messages, which targeted 245 players, were found and then hidden in real time as the system scanned more than 3.1 million comments for harmful digital content following its launch in July 2024. “Safe Sport creates a healthier online environment, free from hateful comments and negative messages,” said Serb Dusan Lajovic, the ATP Player Advisory Council member said on Thursday. “This way, my social media presence is defined by who I am, not by my performance on the court.” Tennis players, like many athletes, often have to deal with the wrath of anonymous abusers online. Former world number three Elina Svitolina said this month, following her defeat by Naomi Osaka in Montreal, that she had been flooded with abuse and death threats, and blamed the “shameful” behaviour on disgruntled bettors. Men's players are equally prone to abuse, and ATP Director of Safeguarding Andrew Azzopardi said that Safe Sport fundamentally changed how his organisation protected athletes online over the last year. During the first year of Safe Sport, officials escalated more than 3,300 comments while they identified 68 perpetrators and initiated 28 law enforcement referrals. Beyond social media, the initiative, which currently covers the top 250 singles and top 50 doubles players, will also support athletes facing email threats, impersonation, deepfakes, as well as scams. The ATP – which governs the men's professional game in tennis – added that it will enhance incident response protocols, broaden protections and advocate for greater accountability from social media platforms in the future.</p>

"I'm very open-minded and I don't care what people think of me," she said in a Q&A on her Instagram. Fans who want the behind-the-scenes look at Vickery's private life will have to pay $12.99 for her content. If they want a more personal touch, that will be extra. "I no longer date for free due to the behavior of men I now require a pre-date deposit send me $1,000 and we can make it happen," Vickery added.

"I will never talk s--- about girls on OnlyFans ever again for the rest of my life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Petra Kvitova has opened up about the terrifying knife attack she suffered which put her career in doubt, admitting she was left 'crying on the court' and 'having nightmares'. The Czech Republic tennis star, now 35, is playing her final tournament this month at the US Open after announcing her retirement from the sport earlier this summer. She shot onto the scene more than 14 years ago when she won Wimbledon in 2011, becoming the first player born in the 1990s to secure a Grand Slam title. That first major was followed by a host of tournament victories worldwide, making Kvitova one of the most recognised names in women's tennis. But in 2016 she suffered a huge setback in her career after being the victim of a horrific knife attack when an intruder entered her home. The criminal, 33-year-old Radim Kondra, told the sportswoman he was at the house to inspect a boiler before grabbing her from behind and holding a knife to her throat. As she tried to free herself, Kvitova, then aged 26, suffered severe wounds to her left hand, leaving her fearing her career could be over. Before undergoing surgery, doctors gave her just a 10 per cent chance of taking to the professional court again - but Kvitova made a miraculous return just six months later. She too went on to win a further 12 titles on her way to a career high of world No 2. 'I knew I was a big fighter on the court but at that time I realised how I am an even bigger fighter in a totally different version of myself,' she told The Guardian this week. There was a question mark, can I play tennis or not? Speaking about her retirement this month, the tennis star admitted she has 'no regrets' about her career. 'You still remember how you played before, how everything was smooth and I was hitting winners and suddenly it's not there,' she added. I still love tennis but everything else, waiting for the practices, waiting for the car, waiting for a match, it's just tiring. I just want to spend more time with him as well. She goes into her final ever tournament in New York this week seeded 14th - and will no-doubt be hoping to end her career triumphantly.</p>

An AI-driven safety tool scanned more than 3.1 million messages sent to the world's top 245 male players over a 12-month period and hid the abusive comments in real time. "Safe Sport creates a healthier online environment, free from hateful comments and negative messages," said Dusan Lajovic, an ATP player advisory council member. It identified 68 people who sent abuse - with 28 referrals made to the police. Online abuse has been rife within the women's game for a number of years. British number two Katie Boulter shared the scale of the online abuse she suffers on a regular basis with BBC Sport in June. "At the very start of my career, it's probably something I took very personally... getting comments about the way you look," said Boulter. "It becomes more apparent every single time you go on your phone. I don't think there's anything off the cards now."

Finishing as runner-up in Melbourne and Paris and falling in the semi-finals at Wimbledon, Sabalenka has failed to get over the line at slams this season despite being a constant favourite. But with her powerful game and a devastating serve – especially on hard courts – she has the tools to make a deep run as the defending champion in New York. The 21-year-old's weak serve, in particular, has been a point of discussion. “I am disappointed in myself when it comes to that part of my game,” she has said. I am winning, having one part of my game on a crutch. So if I can stand on both feet, then I can only imagine it is going to be a lot more straightforward.” Her 23 double faults in a win against Danielle Collins in Montreal were the most in a WTA level match since 2011. Jessica Pegula This year the American has won three singles titles, in Bad Homburg, Charleston and Austin, and reached finals in Miami and Adelaide, but has failed to go further than the fourth round in a slam. At 31, her chance to win a grand slam is getting slimmer, but she has a strong record on hard courts and in New York, finishing as runner-up last year. She has an aggressive baseline game, but her ability to keep focus when things fail to go her way needs improving. Madison Keys It is a good time for American tennis. Outside Gauff and Pegula, Keys will be another name that is expected to impress in New York. Emma Navarro, ranked No 11, will also hope to better her semi-final appearance last year. Emma Raducanu The British No 1 is playing with a newfound freedom, saying she has never felt more confident heading to Flushing Meadows since she won the tournament. Since winning 10 matches to win the 2021 edition as a qualifier, Raducanu has not had a single victory in New York, suffering first-round losses in 2022 and 2024 and missing the 2023 tournament due to surgery. This will be her first grand slam with her new coach, Francisco Roig, who was part of Rafael Nadal's team from 2005 until 2022. The Brighton native had an exciting Wimbledon run but lost in the first round in Cincinnati and lacks hard-court experience. Venus Williams A legend of the sport and a former world No 1, Williams has received a wildcard into the main draw, an obvious decision given the much-beloved former champion will draw massive crowds. However, she has only three wins from 14 since January 2023 and last won a US Open match in 2019. While her love for the game is undeniable, an early exit seems probable. Victoria Mboko The 18-year-old arrives brimming with confidence after winning her maiden WTA title at her home Canadian Open, defeating four grand slam champions along the way. “The US Open, it's been one of my favourite tournaments ever since I was really little. “I don't really have many expectations for myself.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This wasn't just a victory for Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori. It also felt like a victory for all doubles tennis players. Up against some of the game's biggest singles stars, Errani and Vavassori successfully defended their US Open mixed doubles title, defeating Iga Świątek and Casper Ruud 6-3, 5-7, 10-6 in Wednesday's final. “These two days will be really important for doubles in the future because we showed that doubles players are great players,” Vavassori told reporters after the match. “I think this product can grow in the future … With better marketing (it) can become something better.” ‘Don't call it a grand slam': Why has the US Open's new mixed doubles format been so controversial? The 16 pairs mostly played a shortened format of first to four games across three sets, with no advantage after deuce and a 10-point tie break instead of a full third set. Inside a packed-out Arthur Ashe Stadium, a tie-break was ultimately needed to crown Errani and Vavassori as champions, the title sealed when Świątek failed to return a tricky half volley at the net. “I think in doubles we showed it's very important to know how to play doubles,” Errani told reporters. “We show that you have to think, be smart,” she added. “In doubles, there are more things than hitting the ball. This was Errani and Vavassori's third grand slam mixed doubles title, adding to victories at last year's US Open and this year's French Open. Their path to the 2025 trophy was hardly smooth. Back in February when the new format was announced, they released a joint statement calling it a “pseudo-exhibition” and “profound injustice” which “disrespect(s) an entire category of players.” For their part, US Open organizers said that the new format would “elevate mixed doubles with a bigger spotlight and provide a greater opportunity to inspire more people to play and grow the sport.” Most successful men's doubles duo on new mixed format at US Open On Wednesday, Vavassori admitted that he didn't think the pair would have been given a place in the tournament had they not released that statement. However, many viewed the changed format as a success, drawing in bigger crowds who were eager to see some of the game's biggest names – the likes of Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu, Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper – play alongside and against each other. “Arguably more crazy almost than a singles match … super loud,” was how Pegula, a singles finalist at last year's US Open, described the atmosphere. I think the format, honestly, it was really fun … Seeing us compete in a different way was definitely exciting.” “People especially in New York, they love getting into it. It's like a really nice environment to be in.” “But I think maybe one more round and you can put (in) so many other good players. “Maybe you can put also the narrative about singles against doubles. It was a good matchup also for the crowd.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PETRA KVITOVA is set to retire after the US Open – nine years on from the horror knife attack that left her career hanging in the balance. Two-time former Wimbledon champion Kvitova, 35, has been a popular figure on the WTA Tour for more than a decade. In December 2016, Kvitova was shockingly attacked in her own home by a man purporting to be a utility worker. The Czech star suffered a deep laceration in her left hand and required urgent, career-saving surgery. Five months of intense rehabilitation followed, before Kvitova was able to launch the start of what she calls her "second career" at the French Open in 2017. The big-hitting lefty has since enjoyed a "second career" that most players would envy. She reached the Australian Open final in 2019, narrowly losing in three sets to an inspired Naomi Osaka, before battling to the semis at the 2020 French Open. Kvitova has won an incredible 31 career titles, including 12 since her traumatic knife attack. In 2024 she took a break from the rigours of life on tour to have her first child, with son Petr born in July of last year. The inspirational star returned to action earlier this year, but is now to call time on her brilliant career at the US Open. Reflecting on her journey back to the top of the sport ahead of her final tournament, Kvitova told The Guardian: "I knew I was a big fighter on the court but at that time I realised how I am an even bigger fighter in a totally different version of myself. "So it really wasn't easy. There was a big question mark, can I play tennis or not? On her motivations for hanging up her racquet, Kvitova added: "I'm totally ready. "I still love tennis but everything else, waiting for the practices, waiting for the car, waiting for a match, it's just tiring. I just want to spend more time with him as well." New York will next week have a chance to wave goodbye to truly one of the great players of the last decade, and arguably the most inspirational. ©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. This service is provided on News Group Newspapers' Limited's Standard Terms and Conditions in accordance with our Privacy & Cookie Policy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defending champions Sara Errani/Andrea Vavassori won a dramatic 2025 U.S. Open mixed doubles final at Flushing Meadows. They defended their 2024 Grand Slam title in a shortened two-day format that included selected pairings dominated by top-ranked singles players. Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori retain U.S. Open mixed doubles by outclassing singles stars The final probably didn't need to be extended to six-game sets, but maybe without that it would have felt even less of a Grand Slam championship? Hopefully next time — if indeed there is a next time — a few more doubles players get to take part. While the rain in Queens didn't affect the mixed doubles, U.S. Open qualifying during Wednesday did prove to be a bit of a washout. The persistent rain meant all qualifying matches scheduled had to be postponed. The draw for the U.S. Open singles will be made at noon ET on Thursday (which is now today in NYC! They also get the winner's check worth $1 million. Errani thanked the passionate player box, led by Jasmine Paolini, and praised her doubles partner, Andrea Vavassori. “I'm really happy to share them with you.” Errani took a moment to appreciate the doubles players who couldn't play this tournament because of the singles pairings. “We saw today that doubles is a great product,” Vavassori said. A slightly awkward speech from Iga Świątek there, I thought. She almost wasn't quite sure how to frame what she had just taken part in and what had happened. It's remarkable to think that she was playing in the Cincinnati Open at the start of this week — and now at midnight on Wednesday, she needs to start thinking about the U.S. Open singles that start on Sunday. Świątek and Ruud praised Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori for their win, recognizing how great they are at mixed doubles. Świątek also thanked the crowd and fans for their support. “This event is to make you entertained and we did the best job possible.” The 2016 Rio Olympics gold medalists in mixed doubles are on hand to present the trophies: Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Jack Sock. Here is more from that magic moment as Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori won the U.S. Open mixed doubles — not just for themselves, but probably for every doubles player in the world. Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, with the lights dimmed at Arthur Ashe Stadium, ventured into the crowd and shared an embrace with their respective teams. Errani hugged Jasmine Paolini, who was her doubles partner this year at Roland Garros en route to the women's doubles title. They defeat Iga Świątek and Casper Ruud in a thrilling three-set battle 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 (6) in one hour and 32 minutes. It is Errani and Vavassori's third mixed doubles title as a pair. They captured the French Open mixed doubles title this year. Now, they can add another U.S. Open mixed doubles victory to their trophy case. Iga Świątek records her fourth double fault as they switch ends. If you recall, this is what happened in Świątek/Ruud's semifinal match against Pegula/Draper. This third seed doesn't go away. Excellent start for Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori. Iga Świątek and Casper Ruud broke Andrea Vavassori to stay alive in the set. Then, they punished Sara Errani's slow serve to break and take the second set. Now, the teams will play a 10-point super tiebreak. Five minutes ago, it appeared that Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori were going to be crowned mixed doubles champions. Incredible resilience from Iga Świątek, who serves her way out of trouble to hold. The third seed is one game away from forcing a third-set tiebreak. Wild turn of events at Arthur Ashe Stadium. Just blazing groundstrokes, punishing Andrea Vavassori's serve. This set is deadlocked at five apiece. The crowd gets an injection of energy! Andrea Vavassori will serve for the U.S. Open mixed doubles title up 5-4. Do Iga Świątek and Casper Ruud have one last comeback effort in them? Wow did Iga Świątek and Casper Ruud struggle with Sara Errani's slow serve in that game. After being up 0-30, Świątek/Ruud lost four consecutive points due to unforced errors. Now, Errani/Vavassori are one game away from the U.S. Open mixed doubles title. It's just glorious to watch Sara Errani at the net. On break point, she takes the angle away from Casper Ruud, by hitting a smash volley that the Norwegian couldn't handle. That was a dominant game from the Italian pair. Errani/Vavassori are two games away from the U.S. Open mixed doubles title.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori retained their US Open mixed doubles title on Wednesday, beating Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud 6-3, 5-7, 10-6 in the final of a controversial new-look competition that kicked off action at the last Grand Slam of the year. The compact format and beefed-up prize money drew a slew of singles stars like six-time Grand Slam winner Swiatek, but also fierce criticism from some, most notably Errani and Vavassori. In victory, they offered some thinly-veiled remarks that appeared to be aimed at the changes. “A grand slam is neither preparation nor fun,” she told Eurosport. Wimbledon and Australian Open mixed doubles champion Jan Zielinski said before the event that there had been “no communication with players” about the change. Meanwhile, Swiatek, the world number three from Poland, battled through a two-hour tussle with Jasmine Paolini to win the Cincinnati Open on Monday then hot-footed it to New York to team up with Norway's Ruud in the revamped mixed doubles competition. Carlos Alcaraz, men's champion in Cincinnati, also turned out but he and British playing partner Emma Raducanu were eliminated on Tuesday, as was superstar Novak Djokovic, who teamed with fellow Serb Olga Danilovic. The chemistry between Italians Errani and Vavassori, cultivated over a two-year on-court partnership that also saw them win the French Open mixed doubles title this year, proved decisive. They roared to a 4-1 lead in the opening set of the championship match and after Swiatek and Ruud regained one break closed it on a confident hold from Vavassori. The first three rounds -- including the semi-finals on Wednesday night -- were played with short sets to four games with no-advantage scoring and a 10-point match tiebreak in lieu of a third set, before the final reverted to traditional sets with a 10-point match tiebreak. Vavassori admitted he and Errani were on a “mission” to prove themselves against the singles stars. Errani said after their 44-minute semi-final triumph that playing in front of a packed house under the lights on the massive Arthur Ashe Stadium Court was “amazing.” “It's the court where I feel goosebumps every time here,” she said.</p>

They breezed through Day 1 of play with wins over No. 1 after a disappointing defeat at the Mutua Madrid Open. Competing together for the first time in Flushing Meadows, they shrugged off Swiatek's quick turnaround from winning the Cincinnati Open to beat both Madison Keys-Frances Tiafoe and Caty McNally-Lorenzo Musetti in straight sets. In the semifinals, they rallied from a set down and won the match tiebreak from 4-8 down to book their first mixed doubles major final. You can't argue that it's not great for fans because you have full packed Arthur Ashe at midnight on a Wednesday of the quallie week. But just as the Italians looked to have the match sewn up, Swiatek and Ruud scored a crucial break as Vavassori served for the match, breaking Errani to force another Sudden Death.With the title on the line, Errani and Vavassori stepped up once more, showing superior net play to take a 9-5 lead on the Polish-Norwegian team, converting their second championship point when Swiatek netted a final volley.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It promises to be a superb day of ATP Winston-Salem quarterfinal action. Sebastian Korda leads American hopes, while the huge serving Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard will face Hamad Medjedovic. We here at LWOT give our predictions and analysis in this article, but which players do you expect to reach the semifinal? Munar reached this stage after recovering from losing the first set against the defending champion Lorenzo Sonego, who ran out of steam after a long match in the previous round. Fucsovics defeated Roberto Bautista Agut in straight sets. Fucsovics thrived with some time on his shots against Bautista Agut, and I think that could happen again. Medjedovic's win against Mpetshi Perricard earlier this season was on clay in Barcelona. Although the Frenchman is dangerous on all surfaces, facing Medjedovic on a medium-speed hard court should suit him slightly more. It allows the 22-year-old a better opportunity to hold serve and swing freely in return games. Bu's consistency has been relentless in his last two matches against Stefanos Tsitsipas and Mariano Navone. Van de Zandschulp lost the opening set 0-6 against Sebastian Baez before staging a dramatic recovery. The Chinese player seems entirely locked in right now, and I do not trust the inconsistent van de Zandschulp to match him. Playing his first tournament in almost three months, Korda won in three sets without being broken against Kamil Majchrzak. Although his game outside the serve has been rusty, the American has done well to get two wins after being out injured for so long. 11 seed to successfully put enough pressure on Kecmanovic's average serve throughout the match. He is particularly interested in the women's game and loves offering his insights on anything related to the WTA Tour. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

On her Instagram — where she counts over 40,000 followers — Vickery promises “spicy” OnlyFans content that includes her “longest shower vid,” a “late night stretch” and “boat twerking.” “'I no longer date for free due to the behavior of men I now require a pre-date deposit send me $1,000 and we can make it happen,” Vickery wrote. “I will never talk s–t about girls on OnlyFans ever again for the rest of my life,” Vickery said in her Instagram Q&A. For Vickey, it's always been about “pushing boundaries.” “I've always been outspoken about racial hate I get online, body-shaming,” she said on the “Black Spin Global” podcast in June. “I'm very open about a lot of stuff. My career is still going, but I also want to do things outside of tennis. I'm starting to explore more opportunities on social media.” “Being a tennis player definitely helped my marketing,” she added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bolavip, like Futbol Sites, is a company owned by Better Collective. Spanish tennis has always produced standout players, especially on clay courts. This era also marked the beginning of Rafael Nadal's legendary career, and today, Carlos Alcaraz is the sport's central figure in Spain. However, during the 1970s and 80s, there was one player who stood out: Jose Higueras. A former top 10 player, he captured 16 ATP singles titles and reached the doubles final at Roland Garros. Jose Higueras was born in 1953 and turned professional by 1973. Known for his incredible stamina, Higueras was a master at wearing down rivals, relying on consistent, low-risk shots that often forced errors from his opponents. Many of the top players of the 1970s and 80s preferred to avoid facing him, knowing they could be in for a long, grueling match—especially on clay, his favorite surface. He's a former World No.1, 7-time Grand Slam champion who made Jimmy Connors mad at the Australian Open final In doubles, he won three titles and reached the 1978 Roland Garros final alongside Manuel Orantes, ultimately falling to Americans Gene Mayer and Hank Pfister. Among his pupils were Pete Sampras, Jim Courier, Michael Chang, Carlos Moya, Guillermo Coria, and Sergi Bruguera. In 2008, he also worked with none other than Roger Federer, though their partnership was relatively short-lived. By 2008, Roger Federer was already the world's top player, well on his way to becoming a legend. Despite some uncertainty in their relationship, they continued working together. At Roland Garros, Federer ultimately fell in the final to Nadal. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal pose with their trophies after the 2008 Roland Garros final. Their partnership lasted only a short time, as Higueras was soon approached by the USTA (United States Tennis Association). In a 2024 interview with Punto de Break, he recalled: “When Federer won the 2008 US Open, the USTA guaranteed me an 8–10 year period to develop the plan I wanted, so I stopped working with Federer”. That lasted about 6–7 years, which is when a whole new generation of players came through. “When I was working with Federer in 2008, Patrick McEnroe called me and explained that he had been given the director position. He then offered me responsibility for the development program. I knew perfectly well how the USTA works—I had been cooperating with them since 1989, but always independently,” Higueras said. Patrick McEnroe and Jose Higueras speak at a press conference during day eight of the 2010 U.S. Open. After stepping down from his USTA role, Higueras shared with Punto de Break what he is currently focused on and what he hopes for the future. “The only thing I would like to continue doing, as much as I can, is fighting to make tennis increasingly accessible to more people, especially children, creating more opportunities for those who dream of this sport,” he explained. “At the peak of my program, we reached more than 45,000 kids. Tommy Paul, Frances Tiafoe, Taylor Fritz… they all came through the program at age 12. We would go to California, spot a kid who was playing well, contact their coach, and start working with them.
