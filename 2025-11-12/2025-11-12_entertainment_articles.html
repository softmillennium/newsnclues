                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Scary Movie 6 has added Damon Wayans Jr. (New Girl), Kim Wayans (In Living Color), and Heidi Gardner to its cast, setting two franchise vets to return: Gardner's fellow SNL alum Cheri Oteri and Chris Elliott. It's unclear whether Oteri and Elliott will reprise past roles or take on new ones — given the nature of these films, anything is possible. Oteri previously appeared in the first Scary Movie in 2000 as Gail Halstorm, a sensationalist television reporter parodying Courteney Cox's Scream character Gale Weathers. Elliott is remembered for playing Hanson, the creepy haunted mansion caretaker from 2001's Scary Movie 2, though he also appeared in 2006's Scary Movie 4 as a different character — Ezekiel, a village loon. Jennifer Dodge Named President Of Paramount Animation For 'Roofman' Producers Lynette Howell Taylor, Jamie Patricof & Alex Orlovsky, "Responsible, Smart, Dedicated Filmmaking" Is Industry's Way Forward Currently shooting, Scary Movie 6 will also see the return of cast members including Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Regina Hall, Anna Faris, Lochlyn Monroe, Dave Sheridan, and Jon Abrahams. Other newcomers in the cast include Olivia Rose Keegan, Savannah Lee Nassif, Cameron Scott Roberts, Sydney Park, Gregg Wayans, Ruby Snowber, and Benny Zielke. Miramax is producing, with Jonathan Glickman, Alexandra Loewy, and Thom Zadra as executive producers. Paramount will release the film worldwide, as part of its first-look deal with Miramax, on June 12, 2026. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Documentary film festival DOC NYC is America's largest showcase of documentary films and this month comes to New York City from November 12-20, with another week of online screenings through November 30. IFC Center, SVA Theatre, and Village East by Angelika will host screenings of more than 200 films and events, including 30 world premieres as well as many revivals of the year's best in nonfiction filmmaking so far. Related Stories Sundance's Inaugural Robert Redford Luminary Award Will Be Presented to Ed Harris and Gyula Gazdag at 2026 Festival The House in ‘Sentimental Value' Is a Character All Its Own Closing out the festival on November 20, also at the SVA Theatre, will be the NYC premiere of Ivy Meerpol's “Ask E. Jean,” an explosive look at writer and cultural icon E. Jean Carroll and her lawsuits against Donald Trump when he accused her of lying about charges of sexual assault she put against him. From the “Sing Sing” team of Oscar-nominated executive producer Clarence Maclin and JJ Velazquez, who was exonerated last year after more than two decades behind bars, “Beyond” takes a documentary look inside the walls of the historic upstate New York prison — and the incarcerated men who live there and tell its stories. Directed by Asia Johnson (herself previously incarcerated) and Michael Kleiman, the film follows a group of incarcerated men as they prepare for a TED-style public speaking symposium. In the process, “Flophouse America” puts a telescopic lens on the overall housing crisis in the U.S., focused on 12-year-old Mikal, who lives in a constricted, inexpensive room with his hard-drinking parents and beloved cat, Smokey. This intimate documentary also doubles as a coming-of-age film, as Strømdahl tracked Mikal for more than three years, from childhood to young adulthood, and in often harrowing proximity to his parents. Filmmaker Karla Murthy's immigrant portrait has been picking up buzz at other American festivals but makes its New York City premiere at DOC NYC. His life changed after meeting a Texan couple, received a sponsored visa, and arrived in the United States — but the American dream, for H.N. The film weaves home videos, phone conversations, and more to create an intimate love letter addressed to the immigrant working class. “The Merchants of Joy” follows five families hustling every winter to maintain the beloved tradition, and in a market rife with competition over tree sources as well as locations. New York City's own seasonal stand workers add texture to a documentary that tries to parse how the proceeds from just five weeks circa the holidays can make for a sustainable yearlong living. “Do women make harsher films, and what does harsh even mean?” That's the question on filmmaker Isa Willinger's (“Plastic Fantastic”) mind with the cinematic ode “No Mercy.” The documentary features talking heads Céline Sciamma, Virginie Despentes, Nina Menkes, Catherine Breillat, Apolline Traoré, Joey Soloway, and Ana Lily Amirpour to examine how women (and more presently nonbinary filmmakers) have told stories onscreen since the 1960s. Filmmakers Jennifer Ash Rudick and Amanda Benchley chart four decades in “The Life and Time of Marilyn Minter,” a feminist provocateur who has been pushing against contemporary art's borders for almost five decades. The film interweaves rare footage, studio archival materials, and more glimpses into her artistic practice to trace her arc as a rising New York art star who was not without controversy for her brazenly sexual work. Jane Fonda, Naomi Fry, Jeff Koons, Monica Lewinsky, Padma Lakshmi, Lizzo, Laurie Simmons, and more among the celebrities who make an appearance in this fast-paced and entertaining documentary. Pulled from Sundance due to significant developments in the story before ultimately premiering at Cannes, Eugene Jarecki's Julian Assange portrait “The Six Billion Dollar Man” arrives at DOC NYC this week. Filmmaker/actor Jeremy Xido returns to his home city of Detroit to untangle his complicated backstory as the white son of revolutionaries who then became “adopted” by an African American family in a mostly Black neighborhood. “Sons of Detroit” also charts a city shifting from its golden years as the epicenter of the automobile industry, circa Motor City and Motown days, to a city rattled by racism and violence and depleted industry. Zackary Canepari and Jessica Dimmock's gun violence documentary premieres at DOC NYC before heading to HBO later in November. They speak to teachers training with firearms who lead simulations of active shooter situations as well as students for whom preparing for a shooting is just part of the morning routine. Ultimately, the film takes a bird's eye view of a multi-billion-dollar industry that markets school safety with innovations like bulletproof desks. A decorated hit across multiple regional documentary festivals, Ian Bell chronicles the 1999 protest of the World Trade Organization, where 40,000 protests rallied against globalization beginning in Seattle and shared concerns about WTO's environmental and labor impacts. Anarchists, environmentalists, labor unions, and even religious organizations and more came together hoping to turn minds against support of the WTO, which was founded in 1995. The protest lasted from November 30 to December 3, and this film builds off 1,000 hours of archival footage to form an immersive look at a moment in time: a moment when environmental collapse and the end of the middle class were top-of-mind fears.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week, on the glittering 20th anniversary celebration episode of Dancing with the Stars (DWTS), seasoned pro Witney Carson and wildlife-champion-turned-ballroom-competitor Robert Irwin lit up the dance floor with a birthday-party themed routine that perfectly married flair, emotion and showmanship. Irwin broke down in tears multiple times immediately after his performance. Irwin also partnered up with Xochitl Gomez as a part of last night's anniversary episode. With stakes high and celebration in the air, Carson admitted to The Hollywood Reporter that this was a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to dance with Robert on such a pivotal episode. Their performance opened with vibrant party vibes—balloons, flash lighting, and a nod to the show's past, with Carson guiding Irwin through the chart-topping medley of moves. She emphasized how the milestone context gave them a chance to stretch creatively. Meanwhile, Irwin embraced the moment with characteristic positivity, making it clear that for him this dance was more than competition: it was tribute. As a wildlife advocate whose family has long championed conservation, competing amid this celebratory atmosphere added emotional layers. Witney Carson, now well-established on DWTS, is guided by experience; Robert Irwin, though less polished as a dancer, brings raw energy and authenticity. For their birthday-night routine, Carson let Irwin's personality shine: bits of theatrical flair, a moment of surprise, and a wink to his conservation roots. Beyond the ballroom, Robert Irwin and Witney Carson shared a charming off-stage moment that captured hearts. That sweet gesture echoed the spirit of their performance: grounded, genuine, and joyfully unexpected. Carson's reaction—genuine surprise and delight—added a humanizing moment amid the glitz of DWTS. For Irwin, the move highlighted that his appearance on the show is part of a broader mission: leveraging his platform for wildlife awareness and meaningful connections. Together in this episode they proved that celebrations, when done with heart, can transcend spectacle. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If your home is in need of a deep clean ahead of the holidays, why not try the fancy mop-vac combo that Martha Stewart swears by? Made to replace your mops and work on both dry and wet spills, the CrossWave OmniForce also sanitizes — killing 99.9% of bacteria on sealed hard floors, according to the brand — and has a convenient tangle-free brush roller. Bissell's Pet Hair Erasers and hand vacs are also bestsellers, but we are ready to toss our dirty mops and dusty vacs for this modern innovation. For those looking to spend under $200, the popular CrossWave Edge and CrossWave Pet Pro is also included in Amazon's early Black Friday deals. (The latter's better for homes with pets, like Stewart's.) One of the features Stewart likes best is how quickly these all-in-one vac-mops work — and who is not in favor of spending less time cleaning? Over 17,000 Amazon shoppers have given the CrossWave Pet Pro five-star ratings, and we're ready to make room for it in our pantry as well. No word on how long the deal will last, so don't delay!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Wednesday (Nov. 12), ADOR announced that K-pop stars Haerin and Hyein had agreed to continue working with the HYBE subsidiary after “thoughtful consideration with their respective families and thorough discussions” about how to move forward. Other outlets are reporting that the remaining members, Minji, Hanni and Danielle, have also agreed to continue working with the label. Billboard has reached out to HYBE for comment. News of NewJeans' return comes a year after the members first announced plans to leave ADOR and release music independently, alleging that the label had violated their contract by firing their mentor, former CEO Min Hee-jin. This past October, a Korean judge sided with ADOR's stance that the termination of Min was not sufficient grounds to void the band's contract, upholding that NewJeans may not pursue any independent activities until 2029. “We sincerely hope that today's judgment, which comes after long-term verification of various claims and facts and reaffirms prior rulings, will serve as an opportunity for the artists to calmly reflect on this matter,” ADOR said in a statement following its victory. Since forming in 2022, NewJeans has released a number of singles and two EPs, including 2nd EP ‘Get Up', which debuted at No. In 2025, Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein began releasing music and performing under the name “NJZ.” They were ordered to stop doing so after ADOR filed a preliminary injunction, and in June, they were each fined $734,000 for “unauthorized activities.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Billboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

Often just candid enough to be described as “refreshingly honest” (as Netflix's editorial site declares the company's own portrait of Sylvester Stallone), these feature-length exercises in reputation laundering don't give us a peek behind the curtain so much as they invite their stars to remap their private lives onto a stage that gives them full control of the spotlight. If you don't want people to know who you really are, one of the smartest things you can do these days is to star in a slickly produced documentary about yourself so that people feel like you've already told them. Related Stories Sundance's Inaugural Robert Redford Luminary Award Will Be Presented to Ed Harris and Gyula Gazdag at 2026 Festival The House in ‘Sentimental Value' Is a Character All Its Own On that score, Angus Wall's super watchable “Being Eddie” is among the more convincing films of its kind, because instead — or by way — of trying to show us who the real Eddie Murphy is, it commits itself to arguing that Murphy has always known. Indeed, the doc goes so far as to suggest that Murphy's acute self-knowledge is his single most defining trait; that he's only become somewhat inscrutable to us over the years because our perception of him has fluctuated so much more than his perception of himself. As “Trading Places” director John Landis puts it in one of this film's uncommonly insightful talking head interviews: “Eddie has solid middle-class values, and he's too vain to destroy himself.” “My biggest blessing is that I love myself, and that I knew what I wanted to do really, really early,” he says while leaning back into one of the ~412 different couches that line the sprawling Los Angeles mansion he shares with his (briefly glimpsed) wife Paige Butcher, and “Being Eddie” backs him up on both points. Determined to become the next Richard Pryor by the time he was 10 years old (“I wanted to be funny like Richard and cool like Elvis”), Murphy was so locked into his mission from such a young age that he became one of the '80s biggest stars without snorting even a single line of coke — in stark contrast to his hero, who was forced to drop out of “Trading Places” after he set himself on fire amid a rum-soaked freebasing session. All of the arcade cabinets in his game room work perfectly, unlike Jamie Foxx's spray-happy bathroom sink, which he leaves broken in order to allow some funniness to seep into his otherwise enchanted life. Murphy describes himself as “a simple guy,” while good friend Dave Chappelle prefers to think of him as “unscathed.” On the contrary, Murphy proudly identifies as an extremely sensitive type, insisting that sensitivity — as opposed to sheer talent — has been the biggest reason for his success as an artist. As an upstart comedian it allowed him to be ahead of the culture; to see Hollywood's blind spots as clearly as Axel Foley could spot a shotgun at a strip club, and to recognize how a brash young Black kid could turn the entire country on its head by staring its true complexion straight in the face. As a 34-year-old icon whose “Vampire in Brooklyn” inspired David Spade to make a single joke at his expense during “Weekend Update” (“Look children, it's a falling star”), Murphy's sensitivity caused him to turn his back on “SNL” for almost 25 years. So eager to display its access that the documentary's opening shot pilots a drone right through the retractable roof of Murphy's estate, and even more eager not to lose it, “Being Eddie” lets its namesake set the terms for his own successes and failures. Murphy is justifiably proud of himself for belonging to “the first generation of Black overachievers,” and he never hesitates to pat himself on the back. “I was even a rocket ship,” Murphy continues as part of a self-flagellating reference to the 2008 disaster “Meet Dave.” “And to all the young actors, I like to tell them ‘Don't ever play a rocket ship. Murphy acknowledges that he was churning out a lot of shit in the “Meet Dave” era, but this documentary, which happens to be produced by the company responsible for last year's “Beverly Hills Cop” legacy sequel, makes sure to insist that the actor is on another hot streak (“Being Eddie” also includes a quick mention of the actor's upcoming George Clinton biopic, which Bill Condon is slated to direct for Amazon MGM Studios). Still, there's a certain solipsism to how he presents himself here. On the other hand, Murphy is also quick to fall back on the classic “I just want to make people laugh” routine whenever things get too heavy, which can imply a lack of introspection at odds with his self-knowledge. The documentary's funniest moment stems from Murphy downplaying the nuances of his own image, as film critic Elvis Mitchell pops up to articulate the metatextual significance of a scene from “Beverly Hills Cop,” only for Murphy to jump in and explain that he was just laughing at a stupid face one of his friends made off-camera. Still, the takeaway from that edit is less “I'm oblivious to my own signifiers” than it is “I know myself better than even the sharpest viewers ever could.” Does that make it any less frustrating that “Being Eddie” almost completely elides Murphy's wife and children, and — a sweet aside to his late brother Charlie notwithstanding — makes no mention of the more difficult episodes from his personal life? But the point here isn't for us to know who Eddie Murphy is, it's for us to know that he does. And so we're left with the sight of him flipping through the pages of a tabloid magazine that's all about him.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It only took one sequel and Mario's already going into outer space. During a short Nintendo Direct this morning, Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto showed off the first official trailer for next year's The Super Mario Galaxy Movie (out April 26, 2026), featuring a new look at the animated interplanetary adventure. The trailer begins with a look at diminutive Bowser (Jack Black), who is now living in a tiny version of his castle after being shrunk by a mini-mushroom at the end of the previous film. The teaser ends with a glimpse at an action sequence wherein new character Rosalina uses her magical powers to take down a giant robot. Despite that left-field choice, the rest of the OG voice actors were much better received, with Charlie Day and Jack Black, especially, standing out as fan-favorites. Black's Bowser became so popular, he ultimately ended up being the unofficial marketing mascot for the film, with audiences leveraging for his performance of Bowser's ballad “Peaches” to be nominated for an Academy Award (it wasn't). While the 2023 Super Mario Bros. movie drew inspiration from numerous games in the franchise from all different eras of Nintendo history, the new film leans more heavily into two specific titles, 2002's Super Mario Sunshine and 2007's Super Mario Galaxy. Most everything else seen comes from Galaxy, which is considered one of the best entries in the entire series, as well as an all-time great 3D platformer.

Movie was a massive success for Nintendo and Illumination, grossing over $1 billion at the box office and having an extended run topping the streaming charts after releasing digitally on Peacock. The movie's reception was big enough to effectively wash away the sour taste of 1993's live-action catastrophe, with Nintendo accelerating its plans for future feature film adaptations of its properties, including a live-action take on The Legend of Zelda, due out in 2027. The Super Mario Galaxy Movie arrives in theaters on April 26, 2026.</p>

But Yang did not let this very pressing issue die. He asked Grande if she believed in the moon itself, to which she said, “I do.” He then asked if she believed there was a flag planted on the moon, to which Grande coyly replied, “You know, I hear both arguments.” Grande then added forcefully, “The truth is, I don't give a rat's ass.

Eddie Murphy is celebrating 50 years in show business with an inside look at his storied career. Director Angus Wall's film chronicles Murphy's path from a young stand-up to a teenage castmember of Saturday Night Live to the movie star known for Beverly Hills Cop, The Nutty Professor and Shrek. The documentary features interviews with Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Jerry Seinfeld, Dave Chappelle, Tracee Ellis Ross, Chris Rock and many others. 'Being Eddie' Review: Eddie Murphy Tells Some (but Decidedly Not All) in Netflix's Affectionate Doc About Fame and Comedy Idris Elba Returning for New 'Luther' Movie at Netflix (Exclusive) That includes patching things up with director John Landis — who appears in the doc — and also with the SNL team for his 2019 return as host. Murphy reveals the colorful way he envisions accepting a potential honorary Oscar and teases the forthcoming reboot that he's most excited to tackle — if the finished script ever arrives. It wasn't going to be this type of documentary. [When] it started out, I was going to do stand-up comedy again. In 2011, I stopped making movies for about six years. When I got off the couch, I was like, “Let's do Dolemite [Is My Name], and go back to Saturday Night Live, and do stand-up.” We were going to do this documentary just to show what it's like to put a [stand-up] show together. We worked on this thing for five, six years, and now, coincidentally, it's my 50th year in show-business — a milestone for anybody in any business. The documentary teases your potential return to stand-up after all these decades. I'm open to the idea of doing stand-up again. Given the debate in recent years about cancel culture, how do you feel about the stand-up landscape? I feel like that whole canceled thing was just a moment in time where people were like, “Comics have to be careful what they say.” If you go into clubs, the comics are talking crazier than ever. I'm not even thinking about getting canceled at 64, after 50 years in the business. When I worked at Playboy, one of our most popular interviews from over the years was yours [from 1990], where you discussed tensions with John Landis. I love John, and he directed two of the best movies of my career — Trading Places and Coming to America. For years, we've had no heat whatsoever. We even did a movie after that shit. The movie sucked, but we were buddies after. You talk about not having won an Oscar, and there are a lot of people who feel you should have won for Dreamgirls. With Jim Carrey, nobody else could do The Grinch. To me, the performance in The Grinch is just as amazing as Robert De Niro in Raging Bull. Among your projects in the works is a potential reunion with your Dreamgirls director Bill Condon for a George Clinton movie. I got everything but an Oscar, and I'm not like, “This is going to get the Oscar.” The fact of the matter is, if I never win an Oscar, eventually they'll give me one of those honorary Oscars when I'm 90 years old. If they made me wait that long, I'm going to wear a sky blue tuxedo, and when they give me the Oscar, I'm going to urinate on myself while I'm giving a speech. (As an old man:) “This is a wonderful moment here.” See all the piss coming down, and they're going to play the music to make me stop pissing, and it's just going to make me piss even more. I'm just going to piss all down. They have to come take me off the stage. So they got to give me one. Otherwise, the whole thing has no credibility. I'm sure you have younger fans who may know you best for Shrek, and now we have Zendaya joining for Shrek 5. How has it been to revisit Donkey? Donkey is a great character to play. So I was excited when it was like, “Hey, they're doing another one,” and they want to do a Donkey one, too. I come in too hot, every vocal session. The donkey has a lot of singing. The great thing, though, is it's appreciated. I know you've been hoping to revive the Pink Panther franchise. Have you spoken to your Bowfinger co-star Steve Martin for advice on that? No, but I'm looking forward to putting my spin on it. See, I associate Pink Panther with Peter Sellers. He's the original Pink Panther, and it turned into this cool thing. There's been a few movies in my career where it was like, “OK, I'm doing this movie because no Black person has ever done a movie like this.” It was like, a Black Dr. Dolittle? That's like a Black James Bond to me. I'm just looking forward to going into this area that nobody else Black had been in before. Are we getting close to production on that? (To a nearby associate:) You said that script was coming in October, and it's Nov. 3. (Back to the interview:) You heard it? This has been in development for, shit, almost 15 years. They can never get the script right. But right now, we got the two writers that wrote The Pickup, and they wrote the Donkey [spinoff movie] — these writers are super hot and super smart — and supposedly they're really close on A Mad, Mad World. I'm cautiously optimistic because we've been in development for so long. That's the one I want to do more than anything. We see your home's retractable roof in the documentary. Do you have to worry about bird shit? Every now and then, a bird will fly in the house. Other than that, the roof is no problem. Every now and then, some shit on the carpet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Escobedo tragically passed away on Tuesday, Nov. 11, at the age of 59, Kimmel announced in an Instagram post. This comes after the late-night host postponed his show on Nov. 6 due to a “personal matter.” The cause of death was not released. Kimmel and Escobedo grew up across the street from one another in Las Vegas, so when the late-night host first got his show, he made sure that it was Escobedo providing the live music on the show since it first premiered in 2003. Kimmel shared a post on Nov. 11 announcing the news. “Early this morning, we lost a great friend, father, son, musician and man, my longtime bandleader Cleto Escobedo III,” Kimmel wrote. “To say that we are heartbroken is an understatement. The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true. Love to his family,” actor Eric Stonestreet wrote. “❤️❤️❤️ love to u, cleto and his whole family,” Johnny Knoxville commented. The episode was set to include actor David Duchovny, “Stranger Things” star Joe Keery and singer Madison Beer. Entertainment Weekly later confirmed that it was due to a “personal matter” involving Kimmel. Escobedo's father, Cleto Escobado Sr. is also a member of Cleto and the Cletones, playing tenor and alto saxophones. In January 2022, Escobedo shared a photo of himself alongside his dad to celebrate nearly 20 years of playing together and performing on television.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But of all the indicators we've seen lately (calling something a recession indicator has become an enjoyable, if fatalistic meme), one theory from author Erin Baldwin of TikTok might be the most convincing—mostly because she brought receipts. Baldwin argues that People‘s Sexiest Man Alive is a recession indicator when they actually pick the right guy, and her math checks out. “Every time they've gotten it right, there's been a recession.” Two years later, People begins a period of “weird choices,” starting with the selection of Richard Gere and Cindy Crawford as the Sexiest Couple Alive. But weird turns out to be good, economically speaking, because the American economy stabilized after Hurricane Swayze. But an overzealous People can't help but make the right choice in 2000, choosing Brad Pitt, fresh off of Fight Club and Snatch, and Pierce Brosnan in 2001, just before he left Bond behind. Of course, the theory is subjective and relies on you agreeing with People‘s choice. But it doesn't bode well for the country that People made the right call and named Jonathan Bailey Sexiest Man Alive last week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's rare that the original Broadway cast recording of Hamilton: An American Musical is not No. 1 for 454 weeks out of the 528 it has been on the chart since its debut in 2015.) 1 — as is the case this week — it's notable. But the title that bumps Hamilton down to No. 2 this week is actually another album related to the show. A 10-song highlights edition, Hamilton: 10 Shots, arrives at No. The original Hamilton debuted at No. Hamilton: 10 Shots was issued as a streaming set, digital download, CD and on an array of vinyl variants. It also debuts on a number of other Billboard charts: No. 6 on Top Current Album Sales and No. Meanwhile, as for the original Broadway cast recording of Hamilton, it is No. It extends its record for the most weeks on the chart ever for a cast recording. 2 in 2020, marking the highest-charting cast recording since Hair hit No. The Billboard 200 and Cast Albums charts rank the most popular overall albums, and cast recordings, respectively, of the week in the U.S. based on multimetric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FX will be hearing Noah Hawley scream in space (or Earth, we guess) for years to come. Viewership for the Alien reboot, which focused on a child synthetic who befriends a young Xenomorph hunter through the power of mouth sounds, was solid, particularly among Baby Boomers. However, the show ended in September, when Hawley suggested that it might take a few months to get an official word on season two. Still, unlike previous entries in the series, pretty much everyone of import survived this latest run-in with the creature that typically kills everyone. Since his adaptation of Fargo debuted in 2014, Hawley has been loyal to the network and its parent companies, squeezing in Legion for a few years between trips to North Dakota and the greater Twin Cities metropolitan area. There is no word on when season two will premiere, but production of Alien: Earth, which is moving from Thailand to London, will begin next year.
