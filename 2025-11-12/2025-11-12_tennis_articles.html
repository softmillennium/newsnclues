                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Shelton may not have hoped for the start he's had at the Nitto ATP Finals, but his perspective remains as sharp as his serve. After a narrow three-set defeat to Felix Auger-Aliassime on Wednesday, the 23-year-old American slipped to 0-2 on his debut appearance at the season finale in Turin. Yet even in disappointment, Shelton's optimism and competitiveness shone through. In a gripping contest defined by bold play and razor-thin margins, Shelton's fearless shotmaking was momentarily tested at 2/4 in the second-set tie-break, when he took a tumble and was left grimacing and limping between points for the remainder of the set. But I didn't feel it at all through the whole third set.” The fall came at a crucial moment, but Shelton's desire to carry on epitomised his fighting spirit, one that has become a defining trait throughout his 2025 campaign.

I had a lot of clarity this summer on how to play: shot tolerance, what shots to play at certain times. I had a lot of clarity on what my identity was on the court, how I was going to win, my winning formula. I'm still searching for that a little bit right now." Upon returning from his injury in Shanghai in October, Shelton has struggled to post the results he was able to before. He notched a 3-3 record between then and arriving in Turin, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. “These last four tournaments of the year - Shanghai, Basel, Paris, here - have been more difficult for me trying to find that 'wow' feeling,” said Shelton. [There are] certain things that feel very off at this point of the year. The first ball after the serve, things that have been a little off that make it disappointing, [but] a lot of things to be happy about this season.” This week in Turin, Shelton has deployed an aggressive serve-and-volley approach, which was particularly evident against Auger-Aliassime. At 5-5 in the second set, Shelton escaped a nervy Deuce game with consecutive volley winners, which both came from second serves. “I used to hit a lot more double faults and actually be more aggressive on my second serve because I wanted to get a free point on the first serve and second serve. Whenever I'm serving, whether it is first or second, to have an advantage. I think if you look at the guys in the Top 10 right now, a lot of guys who go after the second serve have fast second serves that are difficult to deal with.” After defeats to Alexander Zverev and Auger-Aliassime in Turin this week, Shelton is 0-2 in the Bjorn Borg Group, leaving just a small chance of him qualifying for the semi-finals. Despite this, he is able to draw lessons from the experience and admits that it usually takes him a few appearances to find his feet at tournaments. “I'm just excited to be here, the opportunity,” said Shelton. “[It's] not the best week for me so far. Historically I haven't been the person who's come to a new place, a new tournament, and just been outstanding right away. “For me it's just back to work regardless of how things end here, [to] be proud about the season that I had and the things that I accomplished.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Felix Auger-Aliassime showcased his trademark indoor brilliance and mental fortitude on Wednesday at the Nitto ATP Finals, where he got up and running with a thrilling comeback win over Ben Shelton. The 25-year-old came within two points of defeat in a tense second-set tie-break, but he rallied with grit to seal a 4-6, 7-6(7), 7-5 victory after two hours, 25 minutes in Turin. Although Shelton's relentless serve-and-volley pressure posed constant challenges, Auger-Aliassime stayed composed to notch his Tour-leading 20th deciding-set win of the season. “He was playing much better than me at the start,” Auger-Aliassime said. “It's not often that I get broken twice in the first set indoors… It was a weird start, but as the match went on I was finding ways to put returns in the court. Having fallen to defending champion Jannik Sinner in his opener, he now sits at 1-1 in the Bjorn Borg Group and will face third seed Alexander Zverev in his final round-robin match on Friday. We recovered well, did the right things,” said Auger-Aliassime. “Today I was able to play two-and-a-half hours of high-intensity tennis. I have to give him credit, he kept coming up with great serves. 8 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, has been a proven threat on indoor hard courts over the years, tallying a record 84 wins in these conditions this decade, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Once he levelled the score against Shelton, he found his groove on serve and ultimately found a way through to improving to 2-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Shelton will be left to rue missed opportunities as he slips to 0-2 in the Bjorn Borg Group on his debut at the season finale. He lost five consecutive points from 6/3 in the second-set tie-break against Zverev in his first match and hit a series of crucial unforced errors at a similar moment against Auger-Aliassime.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The British duo delivered a gritty performance to defeat second seeds Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten 7-6(7), 3-6, 10-7 after one hour, 43 minutes in their second round-robin clash. Salisbury required a medical timeout during the first set but — with strong support of Skupski — maintained his sharp reactions late in the Match Tie-break to extend his winning streak at the prestigious season finale to 12 matches, having won consecutive titles with Rajeev Ram in 2022-23. He played great and did most of the work. I'm not sure how we got through that one in the end.” With their victory, Salisbury and Skupski improved to 2-0 in the John McEnroe Group. It was one of three consecutive points to win the match and level their Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Heliovaara/Patten at 2-2. “It was a very good level throughout, there were fine margins,” Skupski said. Salisbury and Skupski are making their team debut at the Nitto ATP Finals following a rock-solid 2025 season, during which they reached five finals, including at Roland Garros and the US Open. They now boast a 57-26 record on the year, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, and will face Harrison and King in their final group-stage clash on Friday.
