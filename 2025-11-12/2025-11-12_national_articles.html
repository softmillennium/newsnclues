                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Approval of the way President Donald Trump is managing the government has dropped sharply since earlier this year with discontent rising from fellow Republicans. President Donald Trump waves after speaking to the media upon his arrival at Joint Base Andrews, Md., Sunday, Nov. 9, 2025, after returning from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla. and en route to an NFL football game between the Washington Commanders and the Detroit Lions. Demonstrators march towards the U.S. Capitol during Trump Must Go Now rally on the National Mall in Washington, Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — Approval of the way President Donald Trump is managing the government has dropped sharply since early in his second term, according to a new AP-NORC poll, with much of the rising discontent coming from fellow Republicans. The survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research was conducted after Democrats' recent victories in off-year elections but before Congress took major steps to try to end the longest shutdown in U.S. history. According to the survey, only about two-thirds of Republicans, 68%, said they approve of Trump's government management, down from 81% in March. The results highlight the risks posed by the shutdown, which Trump and his administration have tried to pin squarely on Democrats, even as U.S. adults have cast blame on both parties as the funding lapse has snarled air traffic, left hundreds of thousands of federal workers without paychecks and compromised food aid for some of the most vulnerable Americans. But it could also indicate broader discontent with Trump's other dramatic — and polarizing — changes to the federal government in recent months, including gutting agencies and directing waves of mass layoffs. Republicans have generally been steadfast in their support for the president, making their growing displeasure particularly notable. “I'm thoroughly disturbed by the government shutdown for 40-something days,” said Beverly Lucas, 78, a Republican and retired educator who lives in Ormond Beach, Florida, and compared Trump's second term to “having a petulant child in the White House, with unmitigated power.” “When people are hungry, he had a party,” she said, referring to a Great Gatsby-themed Halloween party held at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. Approval of his handling of key issues like immigration and the economy have also barely changed since last month. Health care emerged as a key issue in the shutdown debate as Democrats demanded that Republicans negotiate with them to extend tax credits that expire Jan. 1. But Trump's approval on the issue, which was already fairly low, has barely changed. And many of his supporters are still behind him. Susan McDuffie, 74, a Republican who lives in Carson City, Nevada, and retired several years ago, said she has “great confidence in Trump” and thinks the country is on the right track. “I just don't understand how the Democrats can care so little about the people,” she said, scoffing at the idea that Democrats were trying to use the shutdown to force Republicans to address soon-to-skyrocket health care costs. “I don't have any patience for the Democrats and their lame excuses,” she said, arguing that people who are scared about SNAP benefits expiring and struggling to put food on the table are a more pressing issue. Recent polls have indicated that while Republicans may be taking slightly more heat, many think Democrats are at fault, too. Everybody is being stubborn,” said Nora Bailey, 33, a moderate who lives in the Batesville area in Arkansas and does not align with either party. After recently giving birth, she said, she faced delays in getting a breast pump through a government program that helps new mothers while her son was in intensive care. And she is worried about her disabled parents, who rely on SNAP food stamp benefits. Overall, she said she is mixed on Trump's handling of the job and disapproves of his management of the federal government because she believes he has not gone far enough to tackle waste. “I don't see enough being done yet to tell me we have downsized the federal government instead of having all these excess people,” she said. Lucas, the Florida Republican, said shutdowns in which civilians aren't paid are the wrong way to address ideological disagreement. You want to not pay the people in whose hands your lives are every day?” she said. “We need to be addressing these conflicts like intelligent people and not thugs and bullies on the playground.” The AP-NORC poll of 1,143 adults was conducted Nov. 6-10 using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.</p>

Community organizer Delilah Martinez hugs a baker in the historically Mexican-American Chicago after revealing local community members gifted a mixer to him during an interview at Vault Gallerie, Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025. CHICAGO (AP) — The cyclists arrive at sunrise, rolling through Chicago's Latino neighborhoods and stopping at tamale carts, elote stands and candy stalls. Since the start of a federal immigration crackdown that has led to more than 3,200 arrests in the Chicago metropolitan area, streets and storefronts in the city's Latino neighborhoods have emptied out. Local restaurants have struggled as customers stay home. But as fear spread, so did something else — neighbors stepping up for one another and finding creative ways to show up for vendors and restaurant owners. Some Chicagoans have pooled money in their neighborhoods or through local organizations while others have simply bought out taco stands while on their way to work or tamale vendors outside their local bars. In Little Village, Rick Rosales, community organizer with Cycling x Solidarity, helps organize two of these “buy out” rides per week that typically support five street vendors each. “They'll say, ‘I have a lot of tamales. Once, after the group bought out a tamale vendor's cart, that man found them days later to say immigration agents were spotted on his block just hours after. “You saved my life,” Rosales said the man told them. “But it's also so incredibly high stakes because of the fear in our communities right now.” It's hard to say how many street vendors have been targeted by federal immigration agents, said Maria Orozco, outreach organizer for the Street Vendors Association of Chicago, adding she knows of at least 10 who have been detained. Soon after, federal agents arrested a flower seller in the southwest neighborhood of Archer Heights. Then they came for a cotton candy vendor in the predominantly Mexican American Little Village. Immigration agents descended on the Swap-O-Rama flea market in October and detained more than a dozen people. Orozco said losing these vendors is as much a cultural loss as an economic one, calling them part of the “fabric of our city.” She said they bring life, color and flavor to the city's streets, preserving culinary traditions and building a sense of community — and they are beloved by neighbors. Street vendors who are afraid to work or are seeing drops in sales can apply to get financial support through the Street Vendors Association of Chicago. Orozco said local businesses have also hosted pop-up events where a certain percentage of proceeds go to street vendors. “The vendors themselves didn't realize how much Chicagoans love and support them. As Alonso Zaragoza, executive administrator of his neighborhood advocacy group, drove through his predominantly Latino community of Belmont Cragin, he noticed restaurants were mostly empty and dark. So Zaragoza began organizing restaurant crawls, drawing hundreds to struggling Latino-owned eateries. Along the way, street cart vendors hawked elote, cotton candy and balloons as a local musical group played folk and bluegrass music. A bicyclist receives food from a street vendor Yulisa Robles, right, at Gage Park during Street Vendor Bike Tour Series, in Chicago, Sunday, Nov. 2, 2025. “The financial support for our businesses is needed more than ever now,” Zaragoza said. Delilah Martinez, a community organizer and owner of the Vault Gallerie in Pilsen, couldn't stand the silence on her street anymore. Our people were putting their freedom at risk just to work.” The first woman was shocked when Martinez handed her $500. Among those Martinez helped recently was a baker from Mexico City who arrived in Chicago 24 years ago. Each night, he works late, hands dusted with flour, kneading dough until they're sore and aching. For those few quiet hours, after his four children are asleep, the world feels simpler. “There is a magic when I'm baking,” he said in Spanish. A baker in the historically Mexican-American Chicago neighborhood of Pilsen speaks during an interview at Vault Gallerie, Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025. By 3 a.m., he's up again for his grocery store shift, juggling work and school drop-offs. For years, he's sold birthday cakes and pan dulce “by word of mouth” from his small kitchen, dreaming of one day opening his own shop. But the baker has also heard the stories: street vendors arrested on residential streets and federal agents circling his historically Mexican American neighborhood of Pilsen. “I'm afraid for my youngest daughter,” he said. … I can't see myself without my children.” A silver, restaurant-grade mixer gleamed under the fluorescent light. Martinez also handed him an envelope with $1,500 gathered from neighbors hoping to help support him when he feels unsafe selling his baked goods on the street. The man's hand flew up to cover his mouth. He kicked his legs and began to cry. “Thank you so much,” he said, clutching a mixer attachment to his chest.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Britain's Prince Andrew, left, and Britain's King Charles III leave after the Requiem Mass service for the Duchess of Kent at Westminster Cathedral in London, Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2025. LONDON (AP) — He's lost his titles, his house and his reputation, but the former Prince Andrew has gained a hyphen. The disgraced royal is now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and not – as previously announced – Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. It combines the royal family's name of Windsor, chosen by King George V in 1917, with Mountbatten, the surname of the queen's husband, Prince Philip. The queen had initially decided to use Windsor alone, leading her husband to complain that he was the only man in England not allowed to give his children his name. Elizabeth relented, and in an official declaration on Feb. 8, 1960 — days before her son Andrew was born — said: “My descendants other than descendants enjoying the style title or attribute of Royal Highness and the titular dignity of Prince or Princess and female descendants who marry and their descendants shall bear the name of Mountbatten-Windsor.” King Charles III announced on Oct. 30 that he was removing his brother's titles and evicting him from his royal residence near Windsor Castle over his relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Pressure had been growing on the palace to oust the 65-year-old prince from his Royal Lodge home over new revelations about his friendship with Epstein and renewed attention on sexual abuse allegations by one of Epstein's victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, whose posthumous memoir was published last month. The king went even further to punish Mountbatten-Windsor for serious lapses of judgment by removing the title of prince that he had held since birth. Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied Giuffre's allegations.</p>

Charlotte Jones praised the decision to pick Bad Bunny for this year's Super Bowl halftime show, noting that 'our whole society is based on immigrants that have come here and founded our country.' The daughter of Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is standing behind the National Football League's (NFL) decision to tap Bad Bunny to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show, which has garnered criticism due to what critics argue is the performer's anti-American brand. Charlotte Jones, who runs the famed Dallas Cowboys cheerleading team, called the NFL's choice to tap Bad Bunny "awesome" and "amazing." The United States is a society "based on immigrants that have come here and founded our country" and "we can celebrate that," Jones added during a podcast interview on "The Katie Miller Podcast" hosted by Katie Miller, the wife of top Trump aid Stephen Miller. Jones also argued during the podcast segment that football aims to "avoid politics," despite Bad Bunny's politically polarizing brand. We're on a global stage – and we can't ever forget that – our game goes out to everybody around the world. And to get the premier entertainer to want to be a part of our game, I think is amazing," Jones said when asked for her opinion about the selection of Bad Bunny for the Super Bowl halftime show. Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones (right) and chief brand officer Charlotte Jones during training camp at the River Ridge Fields. I mean our whole society is based on immigrants that have come here and founded our country, and I think we can celebrate that, and I think the show is going to be amazing," she continued. However, Miller did not let Jones off easy, saying, "You don't think that at a time when his comments were divisive as it relates to President Trump, when everyone is just seeking this political unification, that you'd want somebody who maybe didn't touch politics to be on that stage?" "I don't think our game is about politics. I don't think people tune in to look at politics. "I think, in that moment, that people will be watching the game, they'll be celebrating music, and nobody will be thinking about whose – what's comments on the left side, what comments on the right side. But, while Jones argues that the Super Bowl is not about politics, it certainly has been for Bad Bunny. The Puerto Rican-born artist, for example, has made politically driven touring choices. He committed ahead of his 2025-2026 tour to no stops in the United States, which the performer explained was due, at least in part, because of the country's crackdown on immigration. Bad Bunny, who performs the majority of his songs in Spanish, said he was protecting his fans from being nabbed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials while attending his shows. Bad Bunny attends the 2025 Met Gala Celebrating "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style" at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 5, 2025 in New York City. The soon-to-be Super Bowl halftime performer also explained that one of the reasons for not touring in the United States was because Puerto Rico, where he is from, is still not a state. "Look, those motherf---ers are in these cars, RAV4s. He lamented that they were going around arresting illegal immigrants "instead of leaving the people alone and working." Meanwhile, the performer also endorsed Kamala Harris for president before she lost to Donald Trump. Puerto Rican musician Bad Bunny sparked a litany of split conversation upon the announcement of his Super Bowl halftime show in 2026. After Bad Bunny was selected by the NFL to be this year's halftime show, several rumors began circulating that multiple teams, including Jones' father's Cowboys, had petitioned the NFL to pick a new halftime performer. However, no formal announcements were put out by any teams making such demands, according to fact-checkers. "I'm not sure we've ever selected an artist where we didn't have some blowback or criticism," Goodell said. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Manhattan Institute fellow Daniel Di Martino, who faces losing his Venezuelan citizenship, discusses Nicolás Maduro's plan to target opposition activists and President Donald Trump's denial that he is considering strikes within the country. As President Donald Trump warns of "zero tolerance" for narco-states in America's backyard, China is tightening its grip on Venezuela — a high-risk economic and political bet that could soon collide with U.S. power. U.S. defense officials confirmed to Reuters last month that a U.S. aircraft carrier strike group had entered the Southern Command region, which covers the Caribbean and the northern coast of South America, to monitor narcotrafficking routes linked to Venezuela's military leadership. The Pentagon said the arrival of USS Gerald R. Ford, carrying more than 4,000 sailors and dozens of tactical aircraft, would "bolster US capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities." It added that the mission aims to "degrade and dismantle transnational criminal organizations." China's President Xi Jinping (R) waves next to Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro during a visit to a housing development in Caracas July 21, 2014. China will provide Venezuela with a $4 billion credit line under an agreement signed on Monday, with the money to be repaid by oil shipments from OPEC member Venezuela. Within weeks, Venezuelan officers were reportedly training for guerrilla-style defense against a possible U.S. strike — an acknowledgment, according to Reuters, of "rising anxiety inside Caracas." Into this standoff, Beijing unveiled a "zero-tariff" trade agreement with Caracas at the Shanghai Expo 2025, announced by Deputy Minister for Foreign Trade Coromoto Godoy. While final implementation details remain pending verification, the goal is clear: Beijing is moving fast into a sanctioned economy that Washington has sought to isolate. "This really looks like China is going to completely take over the Venezuelan economy," said Gordon Chang, an expert on China's global trade strategy. "Venezuela basically sells petroleum to China and very little else," he said. Sailors aboard the world's largest aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), launch a Carrier Air Wing 8 F/A-18E Super Hornet attached to Strike Fighter Squadron 31 from the flight deck, Sept. 26, 2025. "Maduro probably doesn't have a choice," he said. "For Maduro, the zero-tariff pact may offer temporary relief — but it only deepens dependence," Chang added. "I don't see this trade deal as strengthening Venezuela. I see it strengthening China's stranglehold over Venezuela." From Beijing's perspective, the tariff-free pact opens a commercial and strategic doorway into the Western Hemisphere just as Washington doubles down on sanctions. The Council on Foreign Relations estimates that China has extended around $60 billion in loans to Venezuela over the past two decades, much of it repaid through oil shipments — a figure still cited by both Chinese and Venezuelan officials in 2025. Members of the Bolivarian National Militia patrol on a street in the 23 de Enero neighborhood during a military exercise, in Caracas, Venezuela, January 23, 2025. "China has leveraged multibillion-dollar loans and the establishment of satellite positioning and surveillance facilities to secure strategic control over Venezuela's natural resources and critical infrastructure," said Isaias Medina III, an Edward Mason Fellow at Harvard University and a former Venezuelan diplomat to the U.N. Security Council. Medina was referring to the El Sombrero satellite ground station in Venezuela's Guárico province — a joint China-Venezuela project that Western analysts, including a recent Associated Press report, describe as part of a wider space cooperation network giving Beijing an intelligence foothold in Latin America. Medina said the new pact must be understood as one layer in a wider anti-Western alignment. "Under the banner of so-called ‘21st Century Socialism,' initiated by Hugo Chávez and expanded by Nicolás Maduro, the nation has evolved into a forward operating base for regimes openly hostile to the United States and its allies," he said. "Iran, Russia, China, and Cuba have entrenched themselves across Venezuelan territory, using the country as a platform for asymmetric warfare, intelligence operations, and ideological expansion throughout Latin America." He noted that "Russia's military footprint includes more than $12 billion in arms sales and ongoing defense cooperation and Wagner Group presence in military exercises," while Cuban military advisers remain embedded inside Venezuelan security institutions. "Iran has exploited this environment to embed terrorist proxies such as Hezbollah and Hamas, using Venezuela as both a financial hub and a logistical corridor. These activities extend to former training camps in Syria, where Venezuelan operatives and mercenaries have been indoctrinated in hybrid warfare tactics," he added. "Iranian interest includes potential drone manufacturing and uranium mining." Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro has yet to publicly comment on the strike. "Over 30% of Venezuela's population has been forcibly displaced. Despite the enormity of these crimes, many United Nations member states continue to recognize and engage with this illegitimate regime, thereby perpetuating its impunity. For now, Washington's sanctions campaign still constrains Venezuela's oil lifelines. In March 2025, Reuters reported that U.S. threats to impose tariffs on nations buying Venezuelan crude caused a temporary disruption in shipments to China. Beijing dismissed the measures as "illegal extraterritorial actions" and vowed to continue cooperation — but has not disclosed how it will enforce the new tariff-free pact. The Maduro administration is seeking to rally government supporters amidst a sagging economy and refugee crisis. "It can certainly launch a propaganda blitz," he said, "but it can't project military force in the region. It's really up to what President Trump does. China does not have the military strength to oppose American intervention if that's what Trump decides." Medina agreed that the stakes reach beyond economics. "Just three hours from U.S. shores, this narco-terrorist regime has become the operational convergence of organized crime, drug trafficking, money laundering, and human rights atrocities," he said, urging a Western response combining "diplomatic isolation, targeted sanctions, and, when necessary, defensive deployments."

FIRST ON FOX: An expansive liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in the Arctic took a big step forward this week while officials at the Energy and Interior Departments heralded it as key to President Donald Trump's "American energy dominance" agenda. Alaska LNG, a branch of the New York City and Anchorage-based Glenfarne energy company, and energy technology giant BakerHughes announced an alliance that will bring to reality and accelerate plans for a nearly 1,000-mile, 42-inch LNG pipeline down the middle of the Last Frontier, and a corresponding terminal on the Kenai peninsula. The 807-mile pipeline is projected to begin near Prudhoe Bay on the Arctic Ocean and run down to Nikiski – a village halfway between Anchorage and Homer. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum announced the agreement, with Glenfarne CEO Brendan Duval saying that BakerHughes' partnership on the project is a big deal due to the company's expertise in LNG compression technology. Duval said the deal reflects an increased momentum toward the mega-project's future realization and praised the project's ability to attract "global partners [in order] to achieve national and state energy objectives." "Alaska LNG has the potential to be one of the most significant energy infrastructure projects in our nation's history," Wright said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "Today's investment announcement is an important step forward for the project, prosperity in Alaska, and the energy security of America and our allies. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum added that U.S. LNG is "not just an energy source [but] a strategic asset that powers our economy." Burgum, who chairs the National Energy Dominance Council, added that Glenfarne and BakerHughes working together will undoubtedly bear fruit in terms of new energy infrastructure that will create long-term affordable power for Americans that is based in America. BakerHughes chairman Lorenzo Simonelli said in a statement that natural gas provides secure and reliable energy at an affordable rate to consumers. Simonelli also touted its lower carbon output than other fuels. According to reports, the project will include a carbon-capture plant on Alaska's remote North Slope that will have the capacity to remove seven million tons of carbon dioxide from the project annually. Alaska's energy potential has been repeatedly touted by Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who previously told Fox News Digital he is interested in an all-of-the-above approach devoid of politics that instead focuses on what will work and what will keep energy jobs in Alaska and the U.S. writ large versus overseas. Dunleavy and Alaska officials battled the Biden administration over what they called intentional roadblocks against natural resources exploration in places like Ambler and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's Section 1002; commonly dubbed ANWR. Outside the Last Frontier's ubiquitous natural gas and oil prowess, Dunleavy previously told Fox News Digital he would also be open to exploring the power-generating potential of tides in Cook Inlet – said to be the second-strongest lunar-powered ebb and flow in the world. "That basin in Cook Inlet is the most energy-rich basin on the planet: onshore wind, offshore wind, coalfields, oil, gas, tidal, geothermal — all right there," he said, noting a separate wind farm on Anchorage's Fire Island is easily visible from planes taking off at Ted Stevens International Airport. He said, however, the major issue surrounding any green project is energy-storage capability, pointing to Germany as an example of where that problem has come up.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., speaks at the Capitol in Washington, Oct. 15, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — As the House returns Wednesday for the first time in months, Democrat Adelita Grijalva will be sworn in as its newest member, more than seven weeks after winning a special election in Arizona to fill the seat last held by her late father. Grijalva's swearing-in is expected to be among the first actions by House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who had previously declined to seat her until the chamber reconvened following a deal to end the government shutdown. In an interview with The Associated Press, she said the thought of finally being sworn in was “emotional” and “very much a roller coaster.” “We've been waiting for this so long that it's still surreal,” she added. Grijalva's arrival kicks off a busy day on Capitol Hill as hundreds of House members return, their trips potentially complicated by travel delays caused by the shutdown. Lawmakers who win special elections typically take the oath of office on days when legislative business is conducted. But with the House out of session since Sept. 19, Johnson had said he would swear her in when everyone returned. “It feels personal because, literally, my name was attached. Grijalva and most Democrats are expected to oppose it because it does not extend Affordable Care Act tax credits that expire at the end of the year. Republicans can still pass the bill with their slim majority. Grijalva would be the final necessary signature on a discharge petition linked to legislation that would require the Justice Department to release all unclassified documents and communications related to Epstein and his sex trafficking operation. The Epstein Files Transparency Act, co-sponsored by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., is supported by all Democrats and three Republicans, Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Nancy Mace of South Carolina. Grijalva can add her signature to the petition once she is sworn into office. But her move will not mean a vote right away, due to House rules. Emails released Wednesday from Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee are likely to reignite interest in the issue. Epstein write in a 2011 email that Donald Trump had “spent hours” at Epstein's house with a victim of sex trafficking and said in a separate message years later that Trump “knew about the girls.” Leavitt and Republicans on the committee said the person in question was Virginia Giuffre, who accused Epstein of arranging for her to have sexual encounters with a number of his rich and powerful friends. Giuffre, before she died this year, had long insisted that Trump was not among the men who had victimized her. Rep. Raúl Grijalva, Adelita's father, died in March after more than two decades in the House, where he built a reputation as a staunch progressive. Adelita Grijalva has long been active in local politics. She won the Sept. 23 special election with ease to complete the remainder of her father's term, representing a mostly Hispanic district in which Democrats enjoy a nearly 2-to-1 voter registration advantage over Republicans. She told the AP that environmental justice, tribal sovereignty and public education are among her priorities, echoing the work her father championed. “I know that the bar is set very high, and the expectation is high of what we're going to be able to do once sworn in,” she said. This story has been corrected to reflect that Adelita Grijalva was elected more than seven weeks ago, not nearly seven weeks ago.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This photo provided by the New York State Sex Offender Registry shows Jeffrey Epstein, March 28, 2017. The emails made public by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee also include one that Epstein wrote in 2011 in which he said Trump had “spent hours” at Epstein's house with a victim of sex trafficking. The disclosures seemed designed to raise new questions about Trump's friendship with Epstein and about any knowledge he may have had in what prosecutors call a yearslong effort by Epstein to exploit underage girls. That's notable because Giuffre, before she died earlier this year, had long insisted that Trump was not among the men who had victimized her. In a court deposition, she said under oath that she didn't believe Trump had any knowledge of Epstein's misconduct with underage girls. And in her recently released memoir, she described meeting Trump only once, when she worked as a spa attendant at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. Giuffre described being introduced to Trump by her father, who also worked at the club. She described Trump as friendly and said he offered to help her get babysitting jobs with parents at the club. Other members of Epstein's household staff also said in sworn depositions that, while Trump did stop by Epstein's house, they didn't see him engage in any inappropriate conduct. In one 2019 email to journalist Michael Wolff, who has written extensively about Trump, Epstein wrote of Trump, “Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.” In an April 2, 2011, email to Ghislaine Maxwell, an Epstein girlfriend now imprisoned for conspiring to engage in sex trafficking, Epstein wrote, “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump. (Redacted name) spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. Maxwell replied the same day: “I have been thinking about that.” Leavitt said that the unnamed person referenced in the emails is Giuffre, who had accused Britain's then-Prince Andrew and other influential men of sexually exploiting her as a teenager and who died by suicide in April. Andrew, who recently was stripped of his titles and evicted from his royal residence by King Charles III after weeks of pressure to act over his relationship with Epstein, has rejected Giuffre's allegations and said he didn't recall meeting her. “The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,” the statement said. “These stories are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to distract from President Trump's historic accomplishments, and any American with common sense sees right through this hoax and clear distraction from the government opening back up again.” Giuffre came forward publicly after an initial investigation ended in an 18-month Florida jail term for Epstein, who made a secret deal to avoid federal prosecution by pleading guilty instead to relatively minor state-level charges of soliciting prostitution. Lawyers for Maxwell, a British socialite, have argued that she never should have been tried or convicted for her role in luring teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. She is serving a 20-year prison term, though she was moved from a low-security federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas after she was interviewed in July by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.</p>

Kai Trump, the granddaughter of President Donald Trump, explains how her love for golf, which she will be playing at the University of Miami in 2026, was influenced by her grandfather. President Donald Trump's granddaughter, Kai, is at Pelican Golf Club in Belleair, Florida, to make her LPGA debut this week. The 18-year-old received a sponsorship exemption for The ANNIKA, given to emerging golfers to showcase their talents. Ahead of her big weekend, Trump said she got advice from none other than Grandpa himself, who kept it short and sweet. Kai Trump plays a shot before the TGL presented by SoFi match between the Jupiter Links Golf Club and Boston Common Golf at SoFi Center on Jan. 27, 2025 in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Just don't get nervous," she said. "He told me to go out there and have fun and just go with the flow. And she went off, ‘this is what I do, and I'm trying to do that.' She's really interested in just getting better and learning about her swing…" she said, via the Golf Channel. "Just the excitement of learning and getting better, I thought that was pretty cool. President Donald Trump watches his granddaughter, Kai Trump, play golf at Trump National Doral Miami on Oct. 27, 2022 in Miami, Florida, a day ahead of the 2022 LIV Golf Invitational Miami. "Going out there and playing a big course and environment like this, I'm sure she's used to a lot of people looking at her and analyzing everything," Sorenstam added. "One thing that's different this year is I've never seen so many Secret Service people around here; I feel super safe, that's another thing. I just don't know how she does it honestly. To be 18 years old and hear all the comments, she must be super tough on the inside. I'm sure we can all relate what it's like to get criticism here and there, but she gets it a thousand times. So, that's why I just want to give her a break, come out here and have fun. We want her to feel like family here, and I want her to feel welcome. "I mean, give this girl a chance, right?" Trump has gained a following on social media, mostly through YouTube, and recently posted a video of herself playing with her grandfather at Trump National Golf Club, Washington, D.C., and the two of them attending the Ryder Cup. "I just don't view it as him being the president. I view it as, he's my grandpa. We're gonna go out there and play golf," Kai said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital. In that interview, Trump reiterated her goal of going pro.

Fox News host Jimmy Failla and guests highlight former first lady Michelle Obama's new podcast and discuss rumors surrounding her and former President Barack Obama on 'Fox News Saturday Night.' Former first lady Michelle Obama revealed on a recent episode of her podcast that she was left infuriated by a moment on Air Force One in 2009 when she debated whether to wear Bermuda shorts while on vacation — which ultimately led to controversy. "The fact that we had to spend time thinking about that kind of stuff in ways that my husband didn't — it was really infuriating," Obama said during an episode on her podcast, "IMO With Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson," which she co-hosts with her brother. The former first lady explained that in August 2009 she and the former president were set to depart Air Force One for a hike in the Grand Canyon while on their first vacation since the inauguration earlier that year. While she fretted over what attire would be appropriate for a first lady and not draw public criticism, Barack Obama did not need to put effort into thinking about his outfit, she recounted. "It was 100 degrees," Michelle Obama remembered of the conversation. "Barack — I was like, 'Well, what are you wearing?' He was like, 'Well, I'm gonna throw on some sneakers, I'm gonna take my jacket off and roll my sleeves up' because that's what men can do. Then-first lady Michelle Obama and daughter Malia step off Air Force One Aug. 16, 2009, upon arrival at Grand Canyon National Park Airport in Grand Canyon, Arizona. Michelle Obama said she debated whether to wear hiking shorts or a dress before landing on wearing Bermuda shorts. "I can't wear hiking shorts there, and I can't wear a dress to hike," she said. I'm at the Grand Canyon in a tea-length dress with flats? I was like, 'That's not how people go to the Grand Canyon.'" "I eventually opted for the thing that felt mostly me," Michelle Obama continued. The former first lady did face backlash for the attire, as pundits at the time criticized that a first lady wearing shorts while departing Air Force One was too casual, with outlets running headlines such as, "Who Wears Short Shorts? Michelle Obama," "First lady's shorts draw some long, hard looks," and "Michelle Obama: The Shorts Heard Round the World." Former first lady revealed that a 2009 controversy involving an outfit she wore on vacation infuriated her. Michelle Obama said in 2013 that she would not wear shorts again on Air Force One after the 2009 outfit caused "a huge stink." First lady Melania Trump also has faced backlash over her wardrobe attire, including in 2017 when she wore a baseball cap and jeans to visit Texas after Hurricane Harvey that was viewed by some critics as too casual, and again in 2018 when she wore a green jacket while on a trip to visit the border that read, "I really don't care. First lady Melania Trump departs Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on June 21, 2018, wearing a jacket emblazoned with the words "I really don't care, do you?" following her surprise visit with child migrants on the U.S.-Mexico border. Melania Trump later told the media she wore the jacket as a message to the liberal media and other critics: "I want to show them that I don't care," she told ABC News in 2018. President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama and their daughters tour Hopi Point at Grand Canyon National Park Aug. 16, 2009, in Arizona. Fox News Digital reached out to Michelle Obama's office Tuesday for additional comment on the matter but did not immediately receive a reply.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>California has revoked 17,000 nondomiciled commercial driver's licenses issued illegally in the state after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy demanded it do so. Duffy continues to reprimand the state for its noncompliance, and California officials have repeatedly argued they are following all regulations. In a Wednesday announcement, the Transportation Department said the California Department of Motor Vehicles had issued 17,000 nondomiciled CDLs in violation of federal regulations. Duffy has made cracking down on non-English speaking commercial truck drivers a cornerstone priority of his department. His efforts heightened after a fatal semitruck crash in the summer caused by a non-English proficient illegal immigrant, who had one of his licenses issued in California. “After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed,” Duffy said in a statement. “Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked.” Duffy reiterated his threat to pull $160 million in federal funding from the state if it does not revoke all CDLs issued in violation of federal standards. The audit found “systemic non-compliance” in California, Colorado, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, and Washington. A spokesperson for the Transportation Department said it “urges all states to revoke illegally issued CDLs,” and that California was the first state found to be out of compliance. “Sounds like the federal Secretary of Transportation needs a lesson on his own road rules,” Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D-CA) press office wrote in an X post. These licenses will expire in 60 days, according to the department.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge is poised to hear arguments this week in a joint motion by former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James seeking to disqualify interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan from overseeing their criminal prosecutions in the Eastern District of Virginia. U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton sitting by designation from South Carolina to avoid conflicts in the district, will preside over the hearing Thursday morning. Currie has already ordered full grand jury transcripts for review, signaling an unusual level of scrutiny of what Halligan's role was before the indictments were handed up to her by grand jurors. They note that Halligan had never worked as a prosecutor before being appointed to lead the Eastern District of Virginia and that her predecessor, Erik Siebert, resigned under pressure after declining to pursue these same cases. Comey's lawyers argue that those circumstances demonstrate improper political influence over the Justice Department. James's attorneys have made similar claims, calling her appointment “unlawful” and alleging she was placed in the job to target political opponents. Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told the Washington Examiner that Halligan's personal role in obtaining the Comey indictment distinguishes her situation from other recent challenges to acting or interim U.S. attorneys. Even so, Rahmani said disqualification alone would not automatically void the indictments. “You'd need to show more than just a technical violation,” he said. “Even if she were unlawfully appointed, the defense has to show prejudice — that it was fundamentally unfair. The Comey case has also become entangled in a separate dispute over grand jury secrecy. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick, who oversees pretrial proceedings, rebuked prosecutors last week for what he described as an “indict first, investigate later” approach and ordered the government to produce late-September grand jury transcripts and audio for review. Prosecutors, including Halligan and Department of Justice trial attorneys Tyler Lemons and Gabriel Diaz, quickly appealed to U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff, a Biden appointee, arguing that Fitzpatrick's order exceeded his authority and that Comey had not shown sufficient grounds to overcome grand jury secrecy. Nachmanoff largely upheld Fitzpatrick's discretion but sent the matter back for a more limited review of whether the defense has “particularized and factually based grounds” to justify disclosure. At a brief status conference on Monday, the Justice Department agreed to provide all grand jury transcripts and audio for Fitzpatrick's private review, but not for Comey's defense team. Fitzpatrick said an in-camera review was necessary “to make an informed decision” about possible disclosure and will also consider an ex parte filing from Comey's lawyers describing alleged breaches of attorney-client privilege during the grand jury process, according to Law and Crime. Comey's team argues those materials could show misconduct in Halligan's presentation to the grand jury, the first of her career, while prosecutors maintain that no privileged evidence was used and that nothing in the grand jury process supports dismissal. Prosecutors have sought to bolster Halligan's standing, filing a certification on Nov. 3 that Attorney General Pam Bondi lawfully appointed Halligan as a special attorney on Sept. 22, the same day the Comey indictment was presented and ratified her grand jury actions to eliminate any procedural doubt. Supporters, including Mike Davis, a close Trump ally and former chief judicial nominations counsel to Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), have defended Halligan's record. In a recent Federalist op-ed, Davis argued Halligan “proved her critics wrong” by filing evidence that he said “overwhelmingly demonstrates Comey's guilt,” including handwritten notes, emails sent under Comey's alias Reinhold Niebuhr, and communications with Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman that prosecutors allege show coordination with the media. The group alleges she violated ethics rules by acting at Trump's direction and prosecuting cases that career officials deemed unsupportable. Comey faces charges of making false statements and obstructing Congress for his 2020 Senate testimony about the FBI's handling of Hillary Clinton's private email investigation and related leaks to the media. He has pleaded not guilty and claims the prosecution stems from political motives rather than independent law enforcement. She has pleaded not guilty and argues that the case represents an unlawful abuse of power. Both defendants have so far focused their defenses on challenging Halligan's appointment and claiming selective or vindictive prosecution, rather than disputing the substance of the allegations themselves. The federal courthouse in Alexandria was closed Tuesday for the Veterans Day holiday, but a ruling from Fitzpatrick on whether any grand jury materials can be shared with Comey's defense team could come as early as Wednesday. Trials for both Comey and James remain set for January in the Eastern District of Virginia's “rocket docket,” assuming no delays or appeals force the dates to be pushed back.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia announced her campaign to return to Congress on Wednesday, aiming to recapture a key battleground district with more favorable midterm tailwinds next year. “I cannot sit back and watch as Republicans in Congress create chaos while failing to address the rising cost of living and the issues that matter to Coastal Virginians,” Luria said in a statement announcing her bid. A Navy veteran, Luria was among several Democrats with national security backgrounds elected during the 2018 midterms of President Donald Trump's first term. She lost her seat four years later to GOP Rep. Jen Kiggans as Republicans won control of the US House during Democrat Joe Biden's term. Virginia Democrats are ascendant after sweeping the top three statewide offices in this month's off-year elections and making gains in the House of Delegates. National Democrats are optimistic that Trump's overall unpopularity could help them regain the House, particularly by flipping districts in blue-leaning states like Virginia. Luria could also benefit from a potential mid-decade redistricting under consideration by Virginia state lawmakers that could make it harder for Kiggans to win reelection. During her time in Congress, Luria established a moderate reputation, aligning with national security-focused moderates like Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger, who were elected the new governors of New Jersey and Virginia last week, respectively. She also served on the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot, accusing Trump of a “dereliction of duty.” Virginia's 2nd District currently covers a large southeastern portion of the state surrounding Norfolk, shaped by its significant exposure to a large US Navy base there.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senate Democrats have little time to cobble together a bill extending premium Obamacare subsidies with no guarantee that the legislation can pass, a bitter pill to swallow after weeks spent fighting with Republicans over healthcare. There are just three weeks when the Senate is in session before mid-December, when Republicans committed to holding a vote on the subsidies as part of a shutdown deal. The vote was a meager concession as Republicans are not willing to promise the bill will get through Congress or be signed into law. Congressional Republicans have shown some willingness to extend the Obamacare subsidies, subject to new limitations on income and language, eliminating “phantom enrollees.” Senators from both parties also want to pass regulations on pharmacy benefit managers, meaning there is fertile ground for a grand bargain on healthcare before the end of the year. “There are Democrats and Republicans who are both interested in trying to do something in the healthcare space,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) said. Yet most Democrats lack trust in their GOP colleagues and believe they would not commit to extending the subsidies because there is no real interest among leadership or the White House. In the House, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) will not agree to hold the same vote on Obamacare subsidies as President Donald Trump has more recently begun to propose legislation that could only draw Republican support. “It worked to this extent — health insurance became a big issue — and we get our day in court in December [with a vote]. He made the case that a three-year plan would avoid midterm election drama yet not cut off benefits “cold turkey.” “I don't think you'll see a straight one-year extension, because does anybody really want to go through this drama next year during an election cycle?” Tillis said. “You have to give people time to react, and this sort of cold turkey that people are going through now, they couldn't possibly plan for some of these increases.” Kaine, for his part, expressed optimism that common ground could be found when it comes to “means testing … so that the benefits are really to low- and moderate-income people.” However, Republicans are also aware that healthcare could become a liability for them in the midterm elections next year, as out-of-pocket premiums are set to increase for more than 20 million people with plans through the Obamacare marketplace.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Doing so with no prior experience, on the edge of a desert where temperatures hit 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit), might be considered foolhardy. But for Rudie van Vuuren, the gamble paid off. Wrangling a hostile climate as well as hungry baboons, Neuras has plotted a journey from amateur enthusiasm to award-winning winemaking, putting this remote corner of Africa on the grape-growing map. In recent years the tiny vineyard has won international medals, including golds and double golds, for its red wine, ruby dessert wine and “nappa” (a spirit similar to grappa). The winery manager says that none of this would have happened without the unlikely help of a leopard called Lightning. Van Vuuren had lived multiple lives before pursuing winemaking. In 2009, Van Vuuren was in a helicopter, tracking a leopard, Lightning, which had been rescued then released into the wild. The land, he learned, belonged to a retired Shell executive who had nurtured vines on a small area of his 14,500-hectare tract. Van Vuuren descended to inform him there was a big cat on his property and fell in love with the vineyard — and its wine. “I went back and told Marlice (﻿van Vuuren, Rudie's wife) about the place and she just said, ‘Is there water? Without any professional knowledge of winemaking, the Van Vuurens' engine was never likely to hit top gear. It took the couple over a decade to hire the right person to elevate their part-time venture into a serious business. That person was South African winemaker Braam Gericke. Gericke talks about winemaking in mystical terms (“it's not work, it's a form of art;” “you don't change vineyards based on what you want; vineyards change you”) but his deft touch has paid dividends. Grapes are grown under netting to keep off hungry baboons and kudus (large antelopes) that roam the area. Each January, half a dozen employees harvest grapes by hand between 6 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. precisely, says Gericke, before the heat of the day sets in. After barrel fermentation for 12-18 months, a “really old school” manual bottling line is set up, where no more than 200 bottles of a given wine are produced in a season. In a region that can receive as little as 5mm (less than half an inch) of annual rainfall, Neuras has the good fortune of sitting on a basin with five underground freshwater springs. “It's the purest form of water that you can get,” said Gericke. He says the water has been carbon dated and takes 1,800 years to reach the point where it is collected and used in a drip irrigation system. “We now respect what nature has decided for us. We're going to keep the vineyard small (and) we are going to make sure the quality is where it is now, and gets even better,” he added. The skill of Gericke and his team, as well as time and weather, will play a large part in the vineyard's future success. Climate change is making winemaking an increasingly volatile business. Many wine growing regions around the world could be unsuitable for grape growing should the planet breach 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of human-induced climate change, according to a 2024 report. The race is on for winemakers: vineyards are ripping up vines to replace them with more resilient varieties, and some European producers are looking north to land with similar growing conditions to futureproof their businesses (see: champagne houses buying up parts of Kent in the UK). “We grow and make wine in extreme conditions. Intense heat, little rain … (and) climate change (is) only amplifying that,” said Van Vuuren. “So instead of resisting, we try and learn to adapt.” “Our water management approach takes every element into consideration: cultivar, temperature, soil composition, depth of the vine's roots. It's a science on its own,” he added. That said, Neuras has one eye on necessary changes. The vineyard is exploring growing Pinotage, a red grape, known for its resilience and lower water requirements, said Van Vuuren, on an unconventional trellis system better suited to dry conditions. “While water limits physical expansion, it inspires smarter viticulture,” he added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They relied on every political weapon at their disposal. They used their accomplices in the media. They used celebrities to advance their political narratives. Consider the words of House Minority Whip Rep. Katherine Clark (D-MA), who said the quiet part out loud. During an interview on Fox News, Clark admitted — perhaps mistakenly, perhaps in a moment of rare political truth from a left-wing politician —  that the government shutdown was an opportunity for Democrats to gain political leverage, even if people were suffering. “And of course, there will be families that are going to suffer. But it is one of the few leverage times we have.” Democrats repeatedly went on their soapboxes and preached about the shutdown hurting people when, in reality, the only thing they cared about was political power and using perceived “leverage” to amass more of it. They didn't care about any suffering. It is similar to the Democrats' antics during the COVID-19 pandemic when they openly admitted they were taking advantage of the worldwide emergency to benefit their political agenda. It's all part of their “never let a crisis go to waste” political strategy, a sentiment embraced by Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC). “This is a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision,” Clyburn said in the middle of the health crisis during the deadly pandemic. And if they were willing to let people die during a pandemic to advance a political agenda, clearly, they had no problem with people enduring hardships during a government shutdown. For weeks, a common refrain by Democratic politicians was that the shutdown was due to Republicans. This message was disseminated through every available medium. Hence, Republicans needed eight Democrats to join them. They were, as usual, lying to the public. And, when Republicans did use their majority to vote to open the government, it was the Democrats, once again, trying to sabotage those efforts and obstruct the government from opening. Fortunately, eight Democrats had enough decency and common sense to go against their party's line. This stunt should cost the Democrats, politically. They should lose a ton of credibility with the public. Typically, they would weaponize their accomplices in the media to influence and persuade public opinion. It was a tactic Democrats used this time, too. The difference was that Trump and Republicans were privy to their tactics and did not cave. They stood firm and refused to acquiesce. They knew they were on the right side of history on this and were not going to surrender. The Democrats' lemmings and foot soldiers will try to position this as a political win, even though it was an embarrassing defeat. But if there is ever any justice, it is that the people, especially those affected by the shutdown, will realize any pain they endured during this time was due to Democratic political games.</p>
