The firings and gutting of Teen Vogue come amid a hard right pivot by media companies under Trump.

Condé Nast is being accused of engaging in “extreme” union busting and illegal conduct after the media giant fired four union leaders and suspended five others last week, shortly after they confronted management about recent mass layoffs at Teen Vogue.

Last Wednesday, a group of over a dozen editorial staff confronted the company's head of HR seeking answers about two rounds of mass layoffs earlier in the week. This includes the termination of six employees at Teen Vogue — comprising the editor-in-chief and the majority of the team — and the announcement that the left-leaning outlet would be folded into Vogue.com. 

Later that day, four of the employees present were fired, and five other employees were suspended without pay, the union says. Three of the fired members were active in the media company's union, Condé United; Alma Avalle is the vice president for NewsGuild of New York and digital producer for Bon Appetit, and The New Yorker's Jasper Lo and Condé Nast Entertainment's Ben Dewey have both held leadership positions within the union. 

The NewsGuild of New York says that the firings are a “flagrant breach” of their union contract and an “unprecedented violation of their federally protected rights as union members to participate in a collective action.” The Guild's president, Susan DeCarava, called it “one of the most extreme attempts at union busting” that the union has seen in recent years.

The union is holding a rally on Wednesday evening in New York City to call for the reinstatement of the “fired four.” Condé United has filed an unfair labor practice charge over the terminations, and is prepared to challenge the terminations.

“We all plan to fight this all the way to the end,” Avalle told Truthout. She says she's heard from NewsGuild members across numerous major publications expressing solidarity with the “fired four.”

The company claims that the employees were fired for “extreme misconduct,” and accused the workers of “harassment.” Video of the demonstration shows workers trying to question Duncan at his office about the reasoning for the layoffs. Duncan walks away from the workers, declining to answer their questions and telling them to go back to their desks. 

Avalle said that Wednesday's march to the boss was a routine union action and, in fact, was less tense than previous actions have been. New Yorker poetry editor Hannah Aizenman, executive committee vice chair for the Guild and union steward for the New Yorker Union, characterized the march as “peaceful.”

The terminations “amount to nothing less than a declaration of war against our union, and we refuse to let them stand,” Aizenman said in an email to Truthout.

The fact that the layoffs and seemingly union-related terminations come amid a right-wing pivot by media bosses feels more than coincidental and is not lost on the union. One of the fired members, Jake Lahut, is not in union leadership, but has done critical coverage of the Trump administration as a reporter for Wired. The gutting of Teen Vogue, meanwhile, seems overtly targeted at silencing a crucial left-wing publication, analysts have noted.

“I think there is a straight line you can draw between … the Jimmy Kimmel near-cancelation, the Stephen Colbert cancelation, and the near-shuttering of Teen Vogue. These things all feel like they're happening at the same time and for similar issues, you know, and are coming right off of Bari Weiss and the Free Press taking over CBS, this general right-wing shift in media,” said Avalle. “I think it would be naive to say that that's not a factor in what's going on here.”

“By firing us, the company is trying to make examples of us — in the same way that by shuttering Teen Vogue, the company is sending a message about what progressive coverage at Condé Nast leads to,” Avalle went on.

At the same time, the Teen Vogue layoffs included the publication's only transgender staff member, as well as a number of women of color. Avalle — who is trans and an advocate for trans rights — said she wouldn't say her identity is the primary reason she was fired, but likely offered a “convenient” reason for Condé Nast to terminate her. 

“It's just kind of one fewer liability in that sense, you know, one fewer PR thing to worry about in the future,” she said.

Aizenman said that Wednesday's rally is crucial to show worker solidarity in the face of an increasingly hostile political climate.

“Tonight's rally is part of a campaign to demand that our unfairly fired colleagues be reinstated and that the company rescind all illegal retaliatory discipline immediately,” Aizenman said. “In our current anti-labor, anti-journalist climate, we recognize that the stakes of this fight extend beyond our own workplace: there are implications for the entire media industry, and for workers everywhere.”

The emails also suggest Trump spent several hours with a victim at one of Epstein's residences.

Newly released emails from Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender and accused trafficker who was once good friends with President Donald Trump, reveal that Trump was likely aware of the disgraced financier's misdeeds.

The emails from Epstein to Ghislaine Maxwell, his former girlfriend and co-conspirator in the sex trafficking scheme, as well as to author Michael Wolff, were obtained by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee after the committee subpoenaed Epstein's estate earlier this year. Trump is mentioned multiple times in the messages, which were sent over the span of the last 15 years. The correspondences were made public on Wednesday morning.

Trump has denied having knowledge of Epstein's misconduct at the time it was taking place, but the emails reveal he knew more about what transpired than he's previously claimed.

In a 2011 email to Maxwell, Epstein indicated that Trump was keeping a secret for him. “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump,” Epstein wrote.

In that same message, Epstein said that Trump had “spent hours at my house” with a person who later became known as one of Epstein's sex trafficking victims. 

A direct email exchange from 2011 between Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, just released by House Oversight Committee Democrats.

In a 2015 correspondence with Wolff, Epstein asked the author how he should handle possible press inquiries if his past association with Trump was brought up during a 2015 GOP primary election debate. 

“If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable P.R. and political currency,” Wolff responded, adding that Epstein should let Trump “hang himself” if he tries to deny having a previous friendship with him.

And in 2019, shortly before he was arrested, Epstein told Wolff that Trump was aware of his sex trafficking operation.

“Of course he knew about the girls,” Epstein said, adding that Trump had “asked Ghislaine to stop.” 

It's unclear what Trump meant by asking Maxwell to “stop” — whether he was requesting that they halt their operations altogether, or simply their recruitment of girls and women from his Mar-a-Lago resort, which is reportedly one of the reasons the two had a falling out.

Epstein reportedly died by suicide in 2019 while in custody awaiting trial.

The emails are missing important context, which could potentially be remedied by the Department of Justice (DOJ) releasing the entirety of Epstein files in their possession. Rep. Robert Garcia (D-California), the ranking member on the Oversight Committee, said that those files must be made public.

“The Department of Justice must fully release the Epstein files to the public immediately. The more Donald Trump tries to cover up the Epstein files, the more we uncover,” Garcia said, adding that the new emails “raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the President.”

The disclosure of the emails comes as the House of Representatives is set to reconvene following a lengthy government shutdown, and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) has announced he finally plans to seat Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva (D-Arizona), who won a special election in September but has not yet been allowed to assume her role. 

Johnson had blocked her from becoming a member of Congress, claiming he couldn't swear her in because the House was out of session, despite the fact that he had allowed Republicans to be sworn in earlier this year under the same circumstances. 

Grijalva represents the last vote needed in a bipartisan coalition to force a discharge petition vote in the House on releasing the Epstein files in possession of the DOJ. Political observers — and Grijalva herself — have suggested that Johnson was delaying her swearing-in to block that vote from taking place.

For decades, Washington treated Damascus as untouchable. Now, for the first time since Syria gained independence in 1946, a Syrian head of state has walked through the doors of the White House. Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa's official visit to Washington marks a remarkable moment – not only for Syria-US relations, but for the broader political landscape of the Middle East. A handshake that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago now signals a subtle but significant shift in how the West perceives Damascus.

This was already the third meeting between the two leaders in less than a year. Their first encounter took place in May during a meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council, and the second occurred in September at a dinner at the UN General Assembly in New York. Against that backdrop, al-Sharaa's current visit looks like the next step in a dialogue that has become structured, pragmatic, and increasingly institutionalized.

The historical context makes the meeting even more striking. The last senior Syrian official to set foot in the White House was then-Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa in 1999, who took part in peace talks with Israel under the administration of President Bill Clinton.

Farouk – a cousin of Ahmed al-Sharaa's father – was a key figure of the ‘old guard' from the Hafez Assad era and later served as vice president under Bashar Assad until 2014, when his path diverged from that of the ruling establishment.

That lineage adds another layer of meaning to Ahmed al-Sharaa's appearance in Washington. The family name once associated with Ba'athist orthodoxy is now linked to a new generation of Syrian leadership seeking pragmatism and legitimacy in global politics.

Al-Sharaa's visit carried both diplomatic and symbolic weight. It represented a reappraisal of Syria's place in the region's balance of power. The timing was significant: Only a week before the trip, al-Sharaa was removed from the US Treasury Department's list of ‘specially designated global terrorists', where he remained for over a decade. His transformation from an Islamist dissident to a pragmatic leader capable of mediating among rival power centers – both domestic and foreign – has become a defining feature of Syria's new political reality.

During the White House meeting, US President Donald Trump alluded to his guest's past with a characteristic shrug: “Everyone has a difficult past,” he said, setting a tone of blunt pragmatism that resonated throughout the visit. Political calculus, not ideology, was the real engine behind the renewed dialogue.

Al-Sharaa himself handled the issue directly but without defensiveness. In an interview with Fox News, he noted that he was only 19 during the tragic events of September 11, 2001 – “very young,” as he put it – and that the following years were a period of personal and ideological transformation. He deliberately positioned himself as a man who outgrew radicalism and embraced statecraft. According to al-Sharaa, his discussions with the US president focused “not on the past, but on the present and future of Syria,” which Washington increasingly sees as both a geopolitical actor and a potential economic partner.

Soon after his visit, the White House took concrete steps: The US partially eased sanctions, allowing the export of most civilian goods – including American software and technology – to Syria. The move, though largely symbolic, suggested a willingness to test new terms of engagement.

In al-Sharaa's own words, these measures reflected a “new perception” of Syria. Once seen primarily as a pariah state and a source of regional instability, Syria is now being re-evaluated – at least in certain circles in Washington – as a possible partner for stabilization and post-war reconstruction. The Syrian leader underscored that the gas sector could become a key field of cooperation between Damascus and Washington. “Syria has entered a new era,” he declared, “and this will build on a new strategy with the United States.”

Yet, behind this rhetoric of optimism, the situation is far from straightforward.

Despite bold talk of sanctions relief, the reality is far more limited. Washington has only suspended a few provisions of the Caesar Act for 180 days – a temporary measure authorized by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. According to an official statement from the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), sanctions continue to apply to any cooperation involving Syria's partners in Moscow or Tehran.

Moreover, any export of dual-use goods still requires special approval from the US authorities. In practice, this means Washington continues to maintain a firm economic grip on Damascus. Talk of “restoring sovereignty” sounds at this stage more like diplomatic rhetoric than a genuine policy shift.

The partial lifting of sanctions is a political gesture – a way for the Trump administration to test al-Sharaa's pragmatism without committing to a full reset. Syria's leadership understands this perfectly well. As much as Damascus wants to restore trade and attract investment, it also recognizes that the Caesar Act remains a powerful lever for Washington to dictate the terms of engagement. This asymmetric dynamic leaves Syria in a gray zone – formally sovereign, but still economically dependent on external approval.

A second and perhaps even deeper obstacle lies in Syria's unwavering stance on Israel. While al-Sharaa's rhetoric has been noticeably moderate – he called on West Jerusalem to “exercise restraint” following Israeli airstrikes – he has categorically refused to join the Abraham Accords. For Washington, this came as a disappointment: The White House had hoped that Syria might be ready for gradual normalization with the Jewish state. But for Damascus, the matter is non-negotiable.

The Golan Heights remain, in Syrian eyes, occupied territory, and peace with Israel is impossible until the issue is resolved. This position is embedded in Syria's national identity and political culture. No government – whether that of Hafez Assad, Bashar Assad, or Ahmed al-Sharaa – can afford to renounce it without losing legitimacy at home.

The Kurdish issue remains another unresolved pillar of Syria-US relations. For years, Washington has relied on Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria as its key local ally in counter-terrorism operations. Damascus, however, views Kurdish autonomy as a direct challenge to Syria's territorial integrity. These regions, rich in oil and gas, also represent a vital economic resource that Damascus cannot easily concede.

The US, regardless of administration, has shown no intention of withdrawing from Kurdish-controlled areas. Both Democrats and Republicans see their presence there as a strategic foothold. As a result, any dialogue between Washington and Damascus will inevitably run into questions of internal sovereignty – an obstacle that no diplomatic handshake can easily resolve.

Economically, Syria stands on fragile ground. The country's reconstruction needs are enormous – with estimates reaching hundreds of billions of dollars. Ironically, much of the damage was caused by military campaigns launched or supported by the US and its allies. This makes the issue of funding reconstruction both politically and morally charged.

For the Trump administration, the idea of large-scale investment in Syria is a non-starter. With budget constraints at home and opposition in Congress, Washington's willingness to underwrite rebuilding efforts is minimal. Even among Trump's advisers, skepticism runs deep. Many believe al-Sharaa's status as ‘interim president' is too uncertain to justify long-term engagement. The prospect of a new political reshuffle in Damascus makes American investment a risky bet.

For Damascus, however, the logic is different. Economic cooperation – even limited – signals legitimacy and political rehabilitation. Al-Sharaa's government hopes that selective easing of sanctions could attract Gulf or European investors, opening pathways that remain formally consistent with US policy. Yet, without a full lifting of restrictions, Syria's economy remains confined to a narrow channel, its growth potential limited by Western approval mechanisms.

Contrary to early Western predictions, al-Sharaa has not broken ties with Russia, nor has he tilted fully toward the US. His approach has been marked by deliberate balance – a state-centric pragmatism that seeks stability rather than ideological alignment.

His first official visit after taking office was to Moscow, where he met with President Vladimir Putin and reaffirmed the continuity of strategic cooperation. Only afterward did he travel to Washington. The order of these visits was symbolic: It underscored Syria's intention to preserve its partnership with Russia while opening a new channel to the US.

Al-Sharaa has also made clear that he supports Russia's continued military presence in Tartus and Khmeimim, calling it a stabilizing factor in Syria's security architecture.

In his view, Russian bases act as deterrents against extremism and external interference – an argument that finds tacit understanding even among other regional actors, from Türkiye to the Gulf monarchies. These countries, while wary of Moscow's influence, recognize that the Russian military footprint contributes to regional balance and prevents the re-emergence of chaos.

Relations with Iran remain the most delicate dimension of al-Sharaa's foreign policy. While Syria and Iran shared close ties during the war, Damascus has lately shown caution in its dealings with Tehran. The new administration appears intent on redefining this relationship in more transactional, less ideological terms.

Analysts suggest that Moscow now serves as a quiet mediator between Damascus and Tehran, helping to smooth tensions and coordinate regional diplomacy. This triangular dynamic – with Russia balancing between Iran and Syria – is acceptable to other regional powers as well, including Türkiye and the Gulf states, all of whom seek to prevent another destabilizing escalation.

The White House, too, is aware of these undercurrents. Despite rhetoric about Syria's ‘democratization', Washington understands that pushing Damascus away from Moscow could easily backfire, reigniting the very instability the region is trying to contain.

Taken together, these developments reveal a Syrian leadership that is learning to navigate the multipolar order with growing sophistication. Ahmed al-Sharaa has positioned himself as a careful tactician – neither a Western client nor a Russian, but a regional player seeking maneuvering space between great powers. His foreign policy is built on cautious multi-vector diplomacy aimed at one overriding goal: Safeguarding Syria's sovereignty and security in a world where both are constantly under pressure.

In that sense, his visit to Washington was indeed historic. It broke long-standing taboos, softened rhetoric, and produced a few tangible outcomes. But to call it a new era in Syria–US relations would be premature. Deep structural contradictions – sanctions, Israel, the Kurds, and reconstruction – remain unresolved. Until these are addressed institutionally rather than symbolically, the partnership will stay limited and fragile.

Ahmed al-Sharaa's trip may have opened the door to dialogue – but for now, that door remains only half-open.

The outlet used footage from the 2020 protests after the police killing of George Floyd and said it was from 2025.

When President Donald Trump told reporters on Sept. 5 he'd started looking at sending the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, he said it was because of something he saw on television.

He said the city was being destroyed by paid agitators. “What they've done to that place, it's like living in hell,” he said, a comment that became an internet meme as some Portland residents juxtaposed it with tranquil images of the city.

Trump didn't say which channel he watched; he said at one point he saw something “today” and at another “last night.”

The evening before, on Sept. 4, Fox News aired a two-and-a-half-minute segment spotlighting protests outside a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Portland. Similar footage aired the morning of Trump's remarks. The president went on to announce Sept. 27 on Truth Social that he would send troops, saying that he was “authorizing Full Force, if necessary.”

He later said he'd told Oregon's governor, Tina Kotek, that “unless they're playing false tapes, this looked like World War II. Your place is burning down.”

ProPublica examined months of Fox News' coverage and reviewed more than 700 video clips posted to social media by protesters, counterprotesters and others in the three months preceding the Sept. 4 broadcast.

The review found that the news network repeatedly provided a misleading picture of what was happening in Portland.



As The Guardian and The Oregonian/OregonLive have reported, Fox News on Sept. 4 used footage from the 2020 protests after the police killing of George Floyd and said it was from 2025. We found two clear cases from that night as well as one that seemed to match a scene filmed at a key site of the 2020 protests. Fox also mislabeled two other dates of actions shown on screen, and one broadcast implied that a protest from elsewhere was happening in Portland.

Fox News chyrons about Portland the week of Trump's remarks carried phrases like “violent demonstrators,” “protesters riot,” “anti-I.C.E. Portland rioters” and “war-like protests.” One host said protesters were attacking federal officers.

This portrayal of protesters as routinely instigating violence or rioting was also misleading.

As ProPublica reported last week, most clashes between protesters and police before the Fox News segment did not result in any criminal charges or arrests alleging protesters committed violence. What's more, based on news releases from federal and local authorities, charges and arrests for assault, arson or destruction of property were almost entirely confined to a period that ended the night of July 4.

Videos after that date captured numerous images of federal officers forcefully moving in on protesters without corresponding criminal charges alleging protester violence.

A spokesperson for Fox News did not respond to ProPublica's requests for comment.

The Department of Homeland Security did not answer requests to comment on its officers' tactics.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said of action on the ground in Portland: “This isn't a peaceful protest that's under control, like many on the left have claimed, it's radical violence. President Trump is taking lawful action to protect federal law enforcement officers and address the out-of-control violence that local residents have complained about and Democrat leaders have failed to stop.”

Here's how Fox News' coverage of the Portland story was misleading.

Protests in 2020 in the wake of Floyd's murder by a police officer attracted large, sometimes violent crowds to Portland — along with a federal law enforcement response authorized by Trump.

The protests outside the ICE facility have typically been far smaller. Still, Fox spliced footage from 2020 into its coverage this year and claimed it was from 2025.

The Fox News correspondent in the segment that aired the night Trump was watching TV said: “On this night in late June, police used tear gas.”



The accompanying image appears to be not from the ICE building but from the federal courthouse in downtown Portland, more than a mile away. A nearly identical scene was shown in a Fox News video five years earlier. Footage that aired Sept. 4, shot at a slightly different angle, blurs out spots where graffiti was visible on the building in Fox's July 2020 broadcast.

Almost immediately after showing the courthouse scene, the segment cuts to another image as the correspondent says, “federal police used tear gas and flashbangs.”

On screen at that moment is a U.S. Navy veteran who was pepper-sprayed and repeatedly struck with a baton. But it didn't happen in September 2025. The video was posted on social media on July 18, 2020.



The Fox News segment about the ICE protests soon shows an American flag burning.

That image was posted on social media July 16, 2020.

The location: the base of a downtown Portland statue more than a mile away from the ICE building where protests are happening in 2025.

On the webpage for its Sept. 4 video segment, Fox News added an editor's note at least two weeks later: “This video contains footage from protests in Portland in 2020 and 2025.”

After mislabeling 2020 events as 2025, Fox's Sept. 4 evening broadcast explicitly drew a connection between the two periods.

“The protest chaos, which began with riots aimed at social justice in 2020, has severely damaged Portland's reputation,” the correspondent said.

The dramatic footage at this moment shows fires in the street and was broadcast on Fox on Aug. 19, 2020, the day after a crowd smashed through windows and set items on fire in the headquarters for the government of Multnomah County, where Portland is located.

We don't know for certain which broadcast got Trump thinking about Portland. The White House did not respond to questions about what Trump watched. But the president said on Sept. 5 that what he'd seen about Portland on TV was “unbelievable.”

“I didn't know that was still going on,” he said. “This has been going on for years.”

The reality: Portland's 2020 social justice protests, which resulted in hundreds of arrests and continued for months, turned sporadic by early 2021. Protests in years since have led to occasional property damage, but nothing in Portland has matched the scale of events that followed Floyd's death.

Portland police Chief Bob Day said at a Sept. 29 press conference that the city had been inaccurately portrayed through the lens of the protests in 2020 and 2021.

“What's actually happening, and the response we're seeing both from Portlanders and from the Portland Police Bureau,” Day said, “is not in line with that national narrative. And it is frustrating.”

In a Sept. 2 segment featuring the video from a day earlier, anchor Bill Hemmer said it shows “riots raging.” Anchor Trace Gallagher teased another Sept. 2 news segment by once again showing the video, saying, “It's a riot outside a Portland ICE facility.”



The Sept. 4 segment shows Julie Parrish, an attorney for a neighbor of the ICE facility, accusing Portland police of saying, “Meh, we're just gonna let violent rioters do this for 80 straight nights.”

The physical behavior of protesters that was captured on the video is not violent. The camera instead shows federal agents advancing on them. In the moments before officers tossed munitions into the crowd, videos show, one protester was blowing bubbles. The Portland police did not declare a riot, a legal designation that allows for an elevated police use of force. (They declared a riot just once, a police spokesperson said, on June 14.)

The Sept. 1 protest had “little to no energy,” according to an internal Portland police summary, before federal officers dispersed the crowd to collect a prop guillotine that had been brought. Katie Daviscourt, a Trump-aligned commentator who filmed the clips, noted on X that protesters were having dance parties and that their main problems were “not leaving restricted areas, burning a flag, and possessing a deadly object (guillotine).”

ProPublica found a similar pattern for the three months before Fox's Sept. 4 broadcast: clashes that on most days and nights had no criminal allegations of protester violence to explain them.

After dozens of arrests and charges were announced in June through July 4, federal prosecutors accused just three people of crimes at the ICE building in the roughly two months leading up to Fox's Sept. 4 broadcast.

During that same two-month time frame, ProPublica's review found numerous instances of police using force: videos from more than 20 days or nights with federal officers grabbing, shoving, pepper-spraying, tackling, firing on or using other munitions on protesters.

No local arrests or federal criminal charges were announced on these days or nights, and only a handful of dates corresponded with incidents of protester aggression later asserted by federal authorities in their legal case for sending troops.

Asked whether Fox News accurately represented her footage, Daviscourt said: “I stand by my four months of accurate reporting.”

Parrish told ProPublica she had collected evidence that “shows ongoing and persistent activity” outside the facility that under statute and police directive “would be considered riotous, unlawful assembly and/or disorderly conduct.” She declined to share this evidence, saying it was privileged as part of her client's file.

Her lawsuit on behalf of a neighbor living near the ICE facility, which sought to require police to enforce Portland's noise ordinance, was dismissed.

A Sept. 5 “Fox & Friends” segment showed a neighbor from an apartment building confronting protesters over noise, shouting at protesters: “Turn that (bleep) down, it's midnight! … We the people need sleep!”

Fox said it happened Tuesday, which would have been Sept. 2. Co-host Ainsley Earhardt said, “This has been going on for months now, but a lot of this since Labor Day,” as the video shown on screen sandwiches footage of the neighbor between other scenes from the Labor Day protest.

“This is a chaotic city,” co-host Brian Kilmeade said.

The next day, the clip of the neighbor appeared again on Fox News. This time, the network said the footage was from Wednesday, or Sept. 3.

In reality, the confrontation was captured on video months before. Daviscourt published the video on June 29 on X.

On the two September nights that Fox said the neighbor's confrontation happened, ProPublica's review found no videos of violent clashes posted on social media, and federal authorities announced no arrests.

Misrepresentations Continue After Trump's Guard Order
On Sept. 28, the day Trump's order was implemented, a Fox News broadcast played a clip of Kotek saying that Guard troops were not needed in Portland, then immediately cut to a clip of a hectic scene of protesters clashing with police.
“Wish she could see some of those images,” the anchor said. Sarcastically, as a co-anchor chuckled, she added: “Look at that. Just a peaceful protest.”
A small box on the screen showed the footage wasn't from Oregon.

On the two September nights that Fox said the neighbor's confrontation happened, ProPublica's review found no videos of violent clashes posted on social media, and federal authorities announced no arrests.

            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was forced Wednesday to address reports that rivals in his Labour Party are plotting to replace him as leader, just two weeks ahead of a government budget announcement that could worsen his already dire poll ratings.
    


            Several British news outlets quoted Starmer allies late Tuesday saying his job might be under immediate threat and singling out Wes Streeting, the health secretary, as a challenger whose “ambition” was being viewed with “particular suspicion.” Those same allies briefed that Starmer would fight any challenge to his leadership.
    


            Streeting dismissed the reports as “self-defeating nonsense,” telling British media that he could “not see any circumstances under which I would do that to our prime minister.” He accused those responsible for the briefings – the claims circulated to the press – of trying to “kneecap” him.
    


            By Wednesday afternoon, what might have remained as trivial political gossip had snowballed into a full-blown crisis. Accused by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch of presiding over a “toxic” culture in Downing Street, Starmer was forced to address the reports that his allies were briefing against senior members of his government.
    


            Starmer told Parliament that he had not authorized the negative briefings against his colleagues. “I appointed them to their posts because they're the best people to carry out their jobs,” he said. “Any attack on any member of my cabinet is completely unacceptable.”
    


            The latest crisis to hit the government comes ahead of a budget announcement on November 26, when Labour – in order to fill a fiscal black hole – is expected to break a key election pledge by increasing the basic rate of income tax for the first time in half a century.
    


            Chancellor Rachel Reeves has indicated that both tax rises and spending cuts are possible when she lays out her plans for the year ahead, seeking to cut government debt. That would likely spur further attacks from Nigel Farage, whose upstart anti-immigrant Reform UK party has led Labour in national polls for months.
    


            Starmer's popularity went into freefall soon after Labour won a landslide general election victory in July 2024. YouGov, a pollster, said this month that just 17% of Britons approve of the job Starmer is doing as prime minister, while 73% disapprove.
    


            The decision by Starmer's allies to brief against Streeting, the minister tasked with repairing Britain's depleted National Health Service, bewildered and blindsided many Labour Party politicians and has raised questions about the prime minister's control of his governing operation in Downing Street.
    


            “People are flummoxed,” one Labour MP, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told CNN. “Nobody quite understands where this briefing is coming from.”
    


            Lawmakers are also perplexed by the timing of the briefing. After an unsteady first 16 months in office left Starmer one of the most unpopular British prime ministers on record, Labour MPs had previously signaled that the prime minister would not face a serious leadership contest until after local elections in May 2026, giving his government time to reverse its decline in the polls.
    


Keir Starmer is polling as the UK's most unpopular prime minister on record. Where did it all go wrong?



            But the Tuesday night briefing raised the possibility that Starmer could face a leadership challenge after the budget.
    


            Despite Streeting's denial that he is seeking to challenge for the leadership of the Labour Party, a “Wes for Leader” website was created on Tuesday. CNN has asked Streeting's office for comment.
    


            Rumors of a leadership challenge last swirled in September, when Andy Burnham – a former MP and the current mayor of Greater Manchester – launched an audacious and abortive attempt at challenging Starmer's approach on the eve of Labour's annual conference.
    


            Ousting a Labour leader is difficult, however, since any challenger would need the support of 20% of the party's members of parliament, meaning 80 lawmakers would need to agree on an alternative candidate.

Democrats have vowed to vote against the proposal after a faction of Senators broke with party to pass a compromise

US politics – live updates

The House on Wednesday was poised to vote on legislation that would end the longest government shutdown in US history, as Democrats voice fury that the Senate-brokered compromise fails to extend expiring healthcare subsidies.

The House speaker, Mike Johnson, has instructed lawmakers to return to Washington after keeping the chamber out of session for more than 50 days.

On Monday, a splinter group of Senate Democrats joined with Republicans to advance legislation that would fund the federal government through the end of January, without extending the tax credits. The move sparked a furious backlash among Democrats, many of whom have called the plan a betrayal. Influential progressive groups have even called for Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, to resign.

All Republicans supported the measure's passage, except for Rand Paul of Kentucky, along with eight moderate members of the Democratic caucus, several of whom were recently re-elected, or serving their final terms in office.

The expected House vote, on day 42 of the shutdown, comes as hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal workers miss paychecks, millions of Americans risk losing food assistance and airlines warn travelers to brace for continued disruptions.

On Tuesday night, the House rules committee voted 8-4 along party lines to advance the Senate package, setting the stage for it to come to the House floor on Wednesday.

At the start of the hearing, the panel's top Democrat, Jim McGovern, welcomed Republicans back to Washington, decrying their absence during the shutdown.

“Where the hell have you been?” he asked, during in his opening remarks adding later: “Republicans quiet quit their jobs. They disappeared.”

Virginia Foxx, the committee's chair, blamed Democrats for causing the shut down, and noted sharply they walked away “empty handed” after insisting they would not relent until securing an extension of the enhanced healthcare subsidies.

While they did not win that concession, the senators who broke with the Democratic caucus claimed credit for getting the Republican Senate majority leader, John Thune, to agree to hold a vote by mid-December on an extension of the tax credits.

If the subsidies expire, millions of Americans could see sharp rises in their healthcare premiums or lose their marketplace coverage entirely.

The short-term government funding bill would extend government funding at current levels through January 2026 along with three year-long provisions that will fund programs at the Department of Veterans Affairs, the USDA and FDA, and legislative branch operations. The continuing resolution also includes language to stop mass federal firings and reverse dismissals that occurred during the shutdown – prohibiting additional reductions until the end of January – and guarantees back pay to workers who have spent weeks without paychecks.

Speaking Tuesday at a press conference on Capitol Hill, Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, said it was his “strong expectation” that House Democrats will vote against the proposal. He joined a group of Democratic lawmakers to unveil an amendment that would extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits for three years. The proposal was rejected by the Republican-controlled House rules committee on Tuesday night.

“Because of the Republican refusal to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits, in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis that already exists, that they failed to address, healthcare for people all across this country is on the brink of becoming unaffordable,” Jeffries said.

With a 219-member majority assuming full attendance, Johnson can only afford to lose two votes on the bill, and the Kentucky representative Thomas Massie is likely to vote no. But Republican leaders have expressed optimism that the legislation would pass on Wednesday, and be sent to Trump for his signature.

Addressing a crowd at Arlington National Cemetery on Tuesday, Veterans day, Trump congratulated Johnson, calling the Senate bill a “very big victory”.

“We're opening up our country,” he added. “Should have never been closed.”

Editor's note: The article is being updated.

Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko and Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk submitted their resignation on Nov. 12 amid a large-scale corruption scandal, Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said. 

She added that she had submitted their resignation requests to the Ukrainian parliament. 

Earlier on Nov. 12, President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Hrynchuk and Halushchenko to resign. Halushchenko had been suspended from the job of justice minister earlier the same day. 

Halushchenko is being investigated by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) as part of a large-scale corruption case into state nuclear power company Energoatom involving Timur Mindich, a close associate of Zelensky. He has not been officially charged yet. 

Meanwhile, Hrynchuk spent three nights in Halushchenko's apartment in July and August, an anti-corruption prosecutor said at a court hearing on Nov. 12. 

When asked by the Slidstvo.info investigative journalism project, Hrynchuk said she "has not heard about it." She has denied the accusations of wrongdoing. 

A prosecutor also said at a court hearing on Nov. 12 that Ihor Myroniuk, a suspect in the corruption case, had conducted a job interview for Hrynchuk when she was considered for the position of energy minister.

"I believe that the justice minister and the energy minister cannot remain in their positions," Zelensky said on Telegram. "This is, among other things, a matter of trust. If there are accusations, they must be addressed."

Zelensky added that he had asked Svyrydenko to "ensure that these ministers submit resignation letters" and asked the Ukrainian parliament to support their resignations. 

He also said that the National Security and Defense Council would sanction two people implicated in the Energoatom corruption case. 

"Right now, things are extremely difficult for everyone in Ukraine — enduring power outages, Russian strikes, and losses," Zelensky added. "It is absolutely unacceptable that, on top of this, there are still some (corruption) schemes in the energy sector."

An extraordinary meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers has suspended Halushchenko and appointed Lyudmila Suhak, deputy justice minister for European integration, as acting justice minister, Svyrydenko said on Telegram.

Halushchenko said on Facebook on Nov. 12 that he had spoken with Svyrydenko.

"I fully agree: a political decision needs to be made first, and only then should we deal with all the details," he added. “I am not clinging to the position of minister and will not cling to it. I believe that suspension during the investigation is a civilized and proper course of action. I will defend myself in the legal domain and prove my position.”

Meanwhile, Halushchenko's critics argued that suspension was not sufficient. 

“The suspension of the justice minister by the Cabinet is not enough. Two ministers must either resign or be dismissed from their positions by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine," Anastasia Radina, head of the Ukrainian parliament's anti-corruption committee, wrote on Facebook in an apparent reference to Halushchenko and Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk. 

Halushchenko was energy minister from 2021 to 2025 and was appointed justice minister in July. 

The NABU searched premises linked to Halushchenko as part of the Energoatom investigation on Nov. 10. 

Halushchenko, who is sometimes identified as "energy minister" and sometimes by the code name "Professor," features in audio recordings published by the NABU. 

In the NABU tapes, suspects Ihor Myroniuk and Dmytro Basov appear to divide kickbacks between themselves and "Professor" — an alleged reference to Halushchenko.

"We will (divide) it by three: you, me and Professor," Myroniuk said in the recordings. 

Myroniuk, who has also been charged in the case, is a former advisor to Halushchenko.

Anti-corruption prosecutor Serhiy Savytskyi said at a court hearing on Nov. 11 that Mindich had allegedly committed his crimes by unlawfully influencing Halushchenko.

In the tapes, there is a conversation between Mindich and Halushchenko.

Mindich also discusses receiving money from another suspect, Oleksandr Tsukerman, in the recordings. The Anti-Corruption Bureau said that the conversation took place after Halushchenko visited the President's Office.

An anti-corruption prosecutor said at a court hearing on Nov. 12 that, according to the NABU tapes, Zelensky had called Halushchenko during a conversation between the minister, Mindich and Tsukerman. The president allegedly made the call after Mindich sent him a message.

The prosecutor argued that the episode proves Mindich's political influence. Zelensky's press service did not respond to a request for comment. 

Halushchenko had been involved in several corruption scandals even before the ongoing Energoatom case.

In 2024, he was summoned to the Verkhovna Rada for a report on corruption in the energy sector.

The same year, the NABU charged Halushchenko's deputy Oleksandr Heilo with receiving a $500,000 bribe and his former deputy Maksym Nemchynov with corruption in the energy industry. 

Halushchenko, 52, is from Lviv in western Ukraine. He has a law degree from Lviv State University and a management degree from the Ukrainian Foreign Commerce Academy. 

He was the executive director for legal support at Energoatom from 2013 to 2014 and a vice president at the company from 2020 to 2021. 

Halushchenko has also taught law at Kyiv National University's International Relations Institute. 





Reporter

Oleg Sukhov is a reporter at the Kyiv Independent. He is a former editor and reporter at the Moscow Times. He has a master's degree in history from the Moscow State University. He moved to Ukraine in 2014 due to the crackdown on independent media in Russia and covered war, corruption, reforms and law enforcement for the Kyiv Post.



Halushchenko is being investigated by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) as part of a large-scale corruption case into Energoatom involving Timur Mindich, a close associate of President Volodymyr Zelensky. 

Ex-Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov was financing a construction of high-end houses near Kyiv. The money he spent was obtained through the energy corruption scheme now rocking Ukraine,  the Bihus.info investigative journalism project reported on Nov. 12. 

After talking to Rubio at the G7 meeting in Canada, Sybiha praised Trump's "peace efforts and very effective energy sanctions against Russia."



The two are implicated in the $100 million corruption scandal centered on the state-owned nuclear power company Energoatom, which has rocked the country since Monday.

A separate branch of Ukraine's Armed Forces dedicated to unmanned systems was formed in 2024.

The comments follow reporting by the Financial Times (FT) that British national security advisor Jonathan Powell tried to open a backchannel with Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov earlier this year.

A 55-year-old resident of Crimea, the alleged organizer of terrorist attacks, has been charged in absentia. 

Ukrainian forces withdrew from the village of Rivnopillia in northeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast late on Nov. 11, Ukraine's Southern Defense Forces reported.

Ukraine's Special Operations Forces confirmed its "successful fire attack" on Stavrolen petrochemical enterprise, a Lukoil-owned petrochemical complex in Budyonnovsk, southern Russia, overnight on Nov. 12.



Romania must take control over the local subsidiary of Russia's Lukoil to protect its national energy system and enforce international sanctions, Romanian Energy Minister Bogdan Ivan said on Nov. 12.

Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi confirmed that Russian troops have managed to seize "three settlements" amid "fierce fighting" in the region.

Purported videos posted on social media appear to show a large explosion and subsequent fire emanating from the Starobesheve power plant in the occupied community of Novyi Svit in Donetsk Oblast, following a projectile strike on the target.

Kentucky trio oppose provision restricting hemp-derived products, with House to vote on Wednesday on funding bill

A last-minute provision in the federal spending bill heavily restricting hemp-derived products such as CBD and THC drinks could lead some Republicans to vote against the spending bill which, if passed, could end the government shutdown as early as Wednesday.

Kentucky is one of the largest producers of hemp in the country, and Republicans in the state have shown strong support for the hemp industry. Jonathan Miller, an advocate for the hemp industry and former Kentucky state treasurer, said that “Kentucky is really ground zero for the rebirth of hemp” – a niche industry until the 2018 farm bill allowed a much wider variety of legal products.

On Monday night, Kentucky senator Rand Paul broke with the Republican party and voted against the bill because of the hemp provision, which was revealed at the 11th hour and which Paul tried unsuccessfully to have removed.

Miller said Congress has been batting around provisions to ban hemp for months.

“First it was as part of the farm bill, and later was part of last year's spending bill,” Miller said. Paul successfully had the provision blocked before it found its way back into the bill. “Fast forward to November, and the deliberations behind the scenes of the appropriations bill [mean the hemp provision] has been added to the minibus” – the addition concerning spending over various sectors, including agriculture.

Senator Mitch McConnell and Congressman Andy Harris were instrumental in adding the provision, Miller said.

The current version of the provision “criminalizes any product that has more than .4 milligrams of total THC per container. That's basically zero. 95% of hemp products have more than .4 milligrams,” Miller said.

The 2018 farm bill's only restriction on hemp was that it contain less than 0.3% delta 9 THC. The new provision would ban THC in all forms, including delta 8 THC and THCA, which are common in hemp products, and would also criminalize non-intoxicating CBD products with trace amounts of THC, Miller said.

The bill will progress to a House vote as early as Wednesday, and needs 218 votes to pass. There are 219 Republican House members, but Kentucky representatives James Comer, Thomas Massie and Andy Barr have all spoken out against the ban.

Massie said, according to Louisville Public Media: “I detest the tactics that are being used to try to get the ban enacted into law.”

The alcohol industry has been divided in its lobbying for the provision. Alcohol distributors, who also distribute THC beverages, wrote a letter calling for regulation rather than an outright ban, while the American Distilled Spirits Alliance supported the ban.

Miller said that although distributors want to continue to profit from THC beverages, some alcohol manufacturers blame hemp for the recent decline in alcohol consumption among US adults.

Hemp industry leaders are worried the ban will simply turn the market over to unregulated manufacturers.

“If sweeping restrictions move forward, it won't be the bad actors who disappear,” said Jammie Treadwell, CEO of Treadwell Farms, a hemp manufacturer, adding “Instead, we need thoughtful, science-based regulation”

Evan Eneman, CEO of Iconic Tonics, which makes hemp-derived products, said the whiplash around the provision is “destabilizing and unnecessary”.

“Policy made by omnibus surprise, rather than through open hearings, invites unintended harm and fuels the very unregulated, unsafe market lawmakers claim to oppose,” he said.

The unregulated hemp market has led to problems with heavy metal, contaminants and under-age consumption.

“The good news, though, is that this bill doesn't go into effect until a year after passage, so we have a year to try to fix this, and we're hopeful to replace the ban with some strong regulations of these products,” said Miller, who expects the bill to pass.

Cameron Clarke, CEO of Kanha, which makes edibles for the regulated cannabis industry and the hemp market, said in the end, he expects politicians will have to cave to consumer demand for hemp products one way or another.

“Politicians don't typically lead consumer preferences; they follow consumer demands,” he said.

Republicans currently hold a narrow 219-213 majority in the House.Eric Lee/Getty Images

The House of Representatives will try to end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history on Wednesday, with a vote on a stopgap funding package to restart disrupted food assistance, pay hundreds of thousands of federal workers and revive a hobbled air-traffic control system. 

Republicans currently hold a narrow 219-213 majority in the House. But President Donald Trump's support for the bill is expected to keep his party together in the face of vehement opposition from House Democrats, who are angry that a long standoff launched by their Senate colleagues failed to secure a deal to extend federal health insurance subsidies.

Eight Senate Democrats on Monday broke with party leadership to pass the funding package, which would extend funding through Jan. 30, leaving the federal government on a path to keep adding about US$1.8-trillion a year to its US$38-trillion in debt.

U.S. Speaker Mike Johnson faces rebellious House as lawmakers return for shutdown vote

“My urgent plea of all my colleagues in the House – that means every Democrat in the House – is to think carefully, pray and finally do the right thing,” Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who kept his chamber in recess for nearly two months as a pressure tactic in shutdown negotiations, told reporters. 

House Democrats remain adamantly opposed, angered by the Senate deal that came less than a week after Democrats won high-profile elections in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City that many thought strengthened their odds of winning an extension of health insurance subsidies. While the deal sets up a December vote on those subsidies in the Senate, Johnson has made no such promise in the House.

“Donald Trump and Republicans believe the affordability crisis in America is made up. That's why these extremists haven't done a damn thing to lower the high cost of living. You deserve better,” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a social media posting on Wednesday. If approved by the House, the funding package would have to be signed into law by Trump, who heralded Senate passage as “a very big victory” on Tuesday.

Political analysts representing both the Republican and Democratic viewpoints agree that a government shutdown is a bipartisan failure to the people, but think opposing parties should shoulder more of the blame.

The return of the House also means that Johnson could soon face a vote to release all unclassified records related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, something he and Trump have resisted up to now.

Johnson on Wednesday will swear in Democrat Adelita Grijalva, who won a September special election to fill the Arizona seat of her late father, Raul Grijalva. She is expected to provide the final signature needed for a petition to force a House vote on the issue. That means that after performing its constitutionally mandated duty of keeping the government funded, the House could once again be consumed by a probe into Trump's former friend whose life and 2019 death in prison have spawned countless conspiracy theories. 

The funding package also contains three full-year appropriations bills to fund military construction, agriculture programs including food assistance for lower-income Americans and legislative branch operations.

Analysis: The end of the U.S. government shutdown is the result of a fraught compromise

The package would allow eight Republican senators to seek hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages for alleged privacy violations stemming from the federal investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump's supporters. It retroactively makes it illegal in most cases to obtain a senator's phone data without disclosure and allows those whose records were obtained to sue the Justice Department for US$500,000 in damages, along with attorneys' fees and other costs.

“Not a cent for health care, but Republicans wrote in a corrupt cash bonus of at least $500k each for 8 GOP Senators,” Senator Patty Murray, top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a social media posting. 

The funding vote is expected late on Wednesday, and is likely to face some token Republican opposition, from Representative Thomas Massie, a Kentucky hardliner who opposed an initial House funding package in September along with fellow Representative Victoria Spartz of Indiana. 

But the hardline House Freedom Caucus, often a stumbling block to spending bills, is not expected to attempt to block it, said Representative Andy Harris of Maryland, the group's chairman, who added, “I believe we're all going to be on board with this.” 

The pace of airline ticket sales for Thanksgiving travel has slowed as more travellers have reconsidered whether to fly amid all the delays and cancellations.

Hello, this is Kateryna Hodunova reporting from Kyiv on day 1,357 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story so far:

A large-scale assault by Russian troops in light vehicles on the city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast was "partially successful," the 7th Corps of Ukraine's Air Assault Forces reported on Nov. 12.

During the defense of the city, Ukrainian forces destroyed five motorcycles and five cars on Nov. 11 and are working to eliminate firing positions the Russian army established in recent days in some neighborhoods of Pokrovsk, the report said.

The 68th Separate Jaeger Brigade, stationed in the Pokrovsk direction, also released a video on Nov. 12 showing damage to the city caused by the Russian offensive and ongoing attacks.

Russian forces are continuing attempts to strike the neighboring city of Myrnohrad, but have not yet managed to breach its fortified positions, according to the 7th Corps.

The assaults on Myrnohrad are reportedly being launched from the occupied village of Hrodivka, about 5 kilometers (3 miles) southeast of the city, with support of armored vehicles.

Russian troops are also attempting small-group infiltrations, sending two- to four-person teams to probe the southeastern outskirts of Myrnohrad daily.

Last updated 6:29 p.m. Kyiv time.

Delivering humanitarian aid to civilians in Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad has become impossible due to the threat of ongoing Russian attacks, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on Nov. 12.

"It is impossible to reach the people who are there. It is impossible to deliver drinking water, humanitarian aid, or medicine," Filashkin said.

Some 1,253 people remain in Pokrovsk, and 1,350 remain in Myrnohrad.

Only local Ukrainian military personnel are still able to provide assistance to civilians remaining in Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, according to the governor. 

Last updated 5:31 p.m. Kyiv time.

Ukraine is facing increasingly intense Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure, while civilian casualties remain high, according to a U.N. monthly report published on Nov. 12.

Three large-scale attacks on Oct. 10, 22, and 30 targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, triggering emergency power outages across most regions of the country, the report read.

Russian attacks killed at least 148 civilians and injured another 929 in October. The majority of casualties,  around 65%, occurred in front-line regions, particularly in Kherson, Kharkiv, and Donetsk oblasts.

Civilian casualties from January to October 2025 are 27% higher than during the same period last year, and the total number of deaths and injuries in the first ten months of 2025 has already surpassed the figures for all of 2024.

Last updated 5:30 p.m. Kyiv time.

Russia has established the Unmanned Systems Forces, Russian state media reported on Nov. 12.

"Operational regiments and other units have been formed," Sergey Ishtuganov, the deputy head of the new unit, said in an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda.

"Combat work of the unmanned systems units is being carried out following a single plan and in cooperation with other units in battlegroups," he added.

A separate branch of Ukraine's Armed Forces dedicated to unmanned systems was formed in 2024.

Andrii Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation, said that Russia "copied (Ukraine's) successful approaches" as Ukraine's Armed Forces drone units are now operating "very effectively."

Last updated 3:17 p.m. Kyiv time.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has exposed an alleged Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) agent from Crimea who was planning a series of terrorist attacks in Kyiv, the agency said on Nov. 12.

According to the investigation, the plan involved explosions in Kyiv's large shopping and entertainment centers, and in one of the capital's metro stations.

The suspect, a Crimean resident, began working for the FSB after the occupation of the peninsula in 2014. He searched for "like-minded people" to be recruited by the FSB, including Ukrainian citizens from the occupied territory who were not subject to mobilization in Ukraine due to their age.

Kyiv City Prosecutor's Office reported on Nov. 12 that a 55-year-old resident of Crimea, the alleged organizer of terrorist attacks, has been charged in absentia.

Last updated 2:54 p.m. Kyiv time.

Ukrainian forces withdrew from its positions near the village of Rivnopillia in northeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast late on Nov. 11, Ukraine's Southern Defense Forces reported.

Ukrainian troops pulled back from Rivnopillia to more "defensible positions to safeguard the lives of their personnel," according to the Southern Defense Forces.

At the same time, the advance of Russian forces in this sector has been halted, though heavy fighting continues in other areas along the line, the report said.

In the Oleksandrivka and Huliaipole sectors, the Russian army continues mass strikes and has stepped up assault operations near the settlements of Pryvilne, Zelenyi Hai, Rivnopillia, Pavlivka, Vorone, Stepove, and Novopavlivske.

"While attempting to advance, the enemy has suffered heavy losses. In the past day alone, 58 (Russian) personnel were killed and nearly three dozen wounded," the report read.

Last updated 2:22 p.m. Kyiv time.

Soldiers from the 28th Separate Mechanized Brigade have foiled a Russian attempt to break through toward the city of Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast, the brigade said on Nov. 12 on Telegram.

The Russian army attempted to use foggy weather and low visibility to penetrate Kostiantynivka and its outskirts, deploying additional personnel for a potential breakthrough. Yet Ukrainian forces detected the movement in time and launched a counterattack.

The brigade did not provide details on the time or location of the fighting.

"The enemy's losses were significant. Some groups retreated, while others remained in the fields," the brigade said. "Their equipment was also damaged, so there will be fewer vehicles to attack with next time."

Last updated 2:05 p.m. Kyiv time.

Three Russian Geran-2 drones struck the Holodnohirskyi district in central Kharkiv, injuring five people, on Nov. 12, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported.

Four of the injured were hospitalized.

The attack also damaged a civilian enterprise and nearby buildings, according to Syniehubov.

Last updated 12:13 p.m. Kyiv time.

Ukraine's Special Operations Forces confirmed its "successful fire attack" on the Stavrolen petrochemical enterprise, a Lukoil-owned petrochemical complex in Budyonnovsk, southern Russia, overnight on Nov. 12.

Drones of the Deep Strike unit of Special Operations Forces attacked an industrial zone in Budyonnovsk.

"Numerous explosions and a fire were recorded in the target area. The results of the strike are being clarified," Ukraine's General Staff said.

Supernova+, a well-known Ukrainian Telegram channel, posted video footage of the attack, saying that there were "at least three direct hits" on the Stavrolen petrochemical plant facilities. Local residents also reported explosions.

Russia is deploying additional forces near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast due to a shortage of reserves, the Atesh partisan group reported on Nov. 12.

Russian military equipment and personnel are moving toward Pokrovsk on a daily basis, likely from the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia directions, according to the group.

"The Russian army appears to have depleted both its main forces and operational reserves for continuing the offensive, leaving it no choice but to expose other parts of the front," the group said.

Agents from the 506th Russian Motorized Rifle Regiment, operating in the Pokrovsk direction, informed the group that hundreds of soldiers are arriving at their position daily. 

The newly arrived troops are reportedly being sent straight into assault operations, sometimes without even being formally registered with the regiment.

At least two people have been killed and 13 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Nov. 12.

Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 90 out of the 121 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys launched by Russia overnight, according to the Air Force. Thirty-one drone strikes occurred at 19 locations. The fall of the drone debris was recorded at one location.

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian drones attacked the Synelnykove district, killing a 47-year-old man, according to Governor Vladyslav Haivanenko.

In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, the Russian army struck the region 645 times, targeting 16 settlements. A Russian FPV (first-person-view) drone attack killed a 56-year-old man driving a car in the village of Huliaipole, the local military administration reported.

In Kharkiv Oblast, Russia targeted 11 settlements, injuring six people, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov.

In Kherson Oblast, Russian attacks injured five people over the past day, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.

In Donetsk Oblast, Russian strikes injured two people in the city of Kostiantynivka, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin.

Russia has lost around 1,154,180 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Nov. 12.

The number includes 1,000 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

According to the report, Russia has also lost 23,556 (+3) armored fighting vehicles, 67,126 (+87) vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,379 (+13) artillery systems, 1,240 (+1) anti-aircraft systems1,540 (+1) multiple rocket launchers,  and 79,804 (+162) drones.

            US President Trump penned a letter asking the Israeli president to grant a full pardon to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his ongoing corruption trial.
    


            In a letter distributed by the Israeli president's spokesperson, Trump wrote, “I hereby call on you to fully pardon Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a formidable and decisive War Time Prime Minister, and is now leading Israel into a time of peace.”
    


            For any other president, the letter would be an unusual intervention in the domestic politics of a foreign country. But it's only Trump's latest effort to intervene on behalf of one of his most vocal international supporters.
    


            Netanyahu faces charges of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust in three separate cases which began in Trump's first term. He has entered a plea of not guilty and maintains his innocence.
    


            “While I absolutely respect the independence of the Israeli Justice System, and its requirements, I believe that the ‘case' against Bibi, who has fought alongside me for a long time, including against the very tough adversary of Israel, Iran, is a political,  unjustified prosecution,” Trump wrote in the letter.
    


            Despite the ceremonial nature of the role, Herzog has the power to issue pardons. But the request must come from the individual accused of wrongdoing, their legal representatives or a family member. Neither Netanyahu nor any of his close associates have submitted such a petition.
    


            In a statement, Herzog's office said that he holds Trump “in high regard” and appreciates his “unwavering support of Israel, his immense contribution to the return of the hostages, the transformation of the Middle East and Gaza, and the safeguarding of Israel's security”.
    


            But Herzog's office also said that “anyone seeking a pardon must submit a request in accordance with the established procedures.”
    


            Trump has weighed in on Netanyahu's trial several times before. In June, after the 12-day war between Israel and Iran, he wrote a lengthy post on Truth Social in which he called Netanyahu's trial a “ridiculous witch hunt,” echoing language he's used about his own legal threats.
    


            And last month, during his short trip to Israel, Trump raised the issue of a pardon during his address to Israel's parliament.
    


            Turning to Herzog seated nearby, he said, “Mr. President, why don't you give him a pardon?”
    


            Trump's new letter sparked conflicting reactions across the Israeli political spectrum.
    


            Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir wrote on X: “President Herzog, listen to President Trump!”, he said, claiming that the “disgraceful” indictments against Netanyahu “have long since become an indictment against the prosecution itself.”
    


            Opposition Leader Yair Lapid responded to the letter in a statement, saying, “A reminder: Israeli law clearly stipulates that the first condition for a presidential pardon is admitting guilt and expressing remorse.”
    


            Netanyahu is the first incumbent prime minister in the history of Israel to face criminal prosecution while in office.
    


            His trial on charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust began in May 2020.
    


Controversial death penalty and foreign media bills clear first reading in Israel's parliament



            Netanyahu's own testimony started in December 2024 but has been subject to repeated delays and cancellations, the majority of them at his request. Given the remaining stages of testimony, judgment, and potential appeals, the proceedings are expected to continue for several more years.
    


            It is not the first time Trump attempted to intervene in overseas ongoing judicial proceedings.
    


            In July, in a social media post, Trump urged Brazilian authorities to end their prosecution of another international ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, who has since been convicted of plotting a coup, saying Bolsonaro was “not guilty of anything, except having fought for people.”
    


            In April, he came out in support of French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, when she was barred from running for political office for five years after being found guilty of embezzling European Union funds.
    


            “The Witch Hunt against Marine Le Pen is another example of European Leftists using Lawfare to silence Free Speech, and censor their Political Opponent, this time going so far as to put that Opponent in prison,” he posted. “It is the same ‘playbook' that was used against me.”

MUSCAT, November 12. /TASS/. Relations between Oman and Russia have shown resilience and a positive trend amid global developments, Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu said at a meeting of the Russian-Omani Strategic Dialogue.

The event is co-chaired by Shoigu and Secretary-General of Oman's National Security Council Idris al Kindi. "The friendly ties between our countries have recently reached an important milestone, the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. Amid the global processes that transform the world, our bilateral cooperation not only demonstrates resilience but even shows an upward trajectory," Shoigu noted.

The Security Council secretary said he expects to discuss the prospects for strengthening Russian-Omani security cooperation. "I have arrived in Oman with a large Russian interagency delegation. Consultations of working groups are on the agenda, during which the most pressing issues of bilateral cooperation will also be addressed," he added.

Shoigu congratulated his Omani counterpart on the upcoming National Day of the Sultanate of Oman. "At the end of April, Sultan Haitham bin Tariq Al Said of Oman arrived in Russia with a historic state visit. It accelerated the development of dialogue between Moscow and Muscat across all areas. During the Russian-Omani summit we signed a great number of agreements. We are now focused on implementing them," the Russian official said.

Earlier, the press service of the Russian Security Council reported that Shoigu, leading an interagency delegation, has arrived in Oman, where he will discuss security cooperation and the development of strategic projects with the country's leadership. The meeting agenda includes talks with Sultan Haitham bin Tariq Al Said, Head of the Sultan's Office Sultan al Nu'amani, and the Omani Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad al Busaidi.

Three prominent U.S. scholars are moving to the University of Toronto, as the school embarks on a wave of talent attraction spurred in part by upheaval in the postsecondary sector in the United States.

The new hires include a husband-and-wife team of economists, Mark Duggan from Stanford University and Jacquelyn Pless from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as Canadian-born astrophysicist Sara Seager, also currently at MIT.

At the same time, U of T is also announcing a $24-million plan to recruit top young scholars from around the world as well as funding to boost the early career trajectory of the university's own researchers.

The university plans to hire 100 postdoctoral fellows across a range of disciplines over two years, providing combined salary and research funding support of about $100,000 for each.

The U of T initiative announced Wednesday will be funded by the university and is separate from funding packages announced in last week's federal budget. The Liberal government led by Prime Minister Mark Carney has pledged $1.7-billion to attract top international researchers over the next decade or more, with $1-billion earmarked for recruitment of senior researchers.

Federal Budget 2025: Postsecondary schools cheer funds for talent, bemoan foreign student caps

Joshua Barker, a vice-provost and dean of the School of Graduate Studies, said recent geopolitical shifts have put U of T in a favourable recruiting position. Hiring a cohort of talented, young scholars allows the university to get to know them and their work over an extended period at a relatively low cost, Prof. Barker said. The expectation is that some will eventually be hired as permanent faculty.

“This gives us a span of time to work with people, see where the dust is settling globally and then position ourselves for that future,” Prof. Barker said.

Attempts by the administration of Donald Trump to slash funding to research agencies and place pressure on leading universities has countries around the world looking to lure talented scientists away from the U.S.

As Trump cuts university research, American scholars look north

The three new faculty members announced on Wednesday expressed a range of motives for coming to U of T, many of which don't relate to politics in the United States.

For Prof. Seager, Toronto is familiar territory. She grew up in the city and credits a childhood camping trip under dark Ontario skies as the start of her fascination with the universe.

A faculty member at MIT since 2007, she has built her career trying to understand conditions on planets of other solar systems beyond our own and the potential for finding life on some of them. Over the past decade, she has played a prominent role in a NASA mission to discover such planets around nearby stars.

Under the current U.S. administration, NASA and the U.S. National Science Foundation are facing steep budget cuts, but Prof. Seager said her recent work is funded primarily through private money. The decision to come to Toronto was chiefly motivated by other factors including a strong offer of support for her program from U of T and the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics.

“It's going to thrive in Toronto because it's so interdisciplinary,” said Prof. Seager, who plans to arrive in Toronto next fall.

Meet Canada's next generation of researchers

For Prof. Duggan, an economist at Stanford University who served on the White House Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama era, what attracted him to Toronto was the opportunity to teach at the same institution as his wife. He and Prof. Pless, an MIT economist, have been living at opposite ends of the continent. Although both said they are concerned with U.S. politics and the situation facing universities, they said it was not a core driver of their decision to come to Canada.

Prof. Pless will take up a post as professor of strategic management at the Rotman School of Management. 

“The way I see Toronto and Canada more broadly is that it's really a great place to study how innovation can solve major societal challenges like climate change,” she said. She and her husband will move to Toronto next summer.

Prof. Duggan will be the director of the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy. 

“I'm a huge believer in the ability of research and what's happening in universities to make a practical, positive impact in the world,” he said. “What better time for two nerdy economists to come to Canada than when the Prime Minister is an economist?”

            In the end, there was no honeymoon period.
    


            Just two weeks ago, Japan's new prime minister Sanae Takaichi was shaking hands with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Now, relations between the two Asian nations have dramatically soured, with escalating nationalist rhetoric in China and even an apparent threat of beheading from one of its diplomats.
    


            Takaichi, who was elected as Japan's first female prime minister just last month, has become embroiled in a growing row with Beijing over Taiwan – the democratic island that China's ruling Communist Party claims as its own, and a red line it has warned other countries not to cross.
    


            The furor began when Takaichi told the Japanese parliament on November 7 that a Chinese attack on Taiwan – which lies just 60 miles (100 kilometers) from Japanese territory – would count as “a situation threatening Japan's survival” and could trigger a military response from Tokyo.
    


            Beijing has not ruled out using force to take control of the island and has ramped up the frequency and complexity of its military drills around Taiwan in recent years.
    


            Previous Japanese leaders have avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response. And Washington deliberately remains vague on how it would respond to a hypothetical invasion, a policy known as “strategic ambiguity.”
    


China warns Taiwan and human rights remain among its ‘red lines' after Trump-Xi talks



            Wading into the thorny issue of Taiwan's defense has gotten other world leaders in hot water with Beijing before. Former US President Joe Biden set off a diplomatic panic during his time in office when he said multiple times that the United States would be willing to intervene militarily if China attacked Taiwan – forcing the White House to repeatedly walk back his comments, and sparking anger each time in Beijing.
    


            Takaichi's remarks were met with an even more vehement response.
    


            “The dirty neck that sticks itself in must be cut off,” wrote the Chinese consul general in Osaka, Xue Jian, in a post on X that has since been deleted.
    


            The fallout has spiraled since, with Japan criticizing Xue's “extremely inappropriate” post and Taiwan voicing concern about Xue's “threatening” remarks, according to Reuters.
    


            Beijing, meanwhile, has defended its position and Xue's comments.
    


            A spokesperson from China's foreign ministry on Monday accused Japan of “grossly interfering with China's internal affairs,” saying Xue's post was simply responding to Takaichi's “erroneous and dangerous remarks.”
    


            For some, the controversy harks back to China's “wolf warrior” diplomacy – an aggressive style of foreign policy that emerged in the early 2020s, which often saw Chinese officials take to social media platforms to hit back directly - and often colorfully - at any criticism of China, but has since been dialed back as Beijing looked to win back lost goodwill among Western nations.
    


            And within China, where there is already significant streak of anti-Japanese sentiment, state media and other prominent voices this week have further fanned outrage over Takaichi's statement.
    


            Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily condemned Takaichi as “recklessly shooting her mouth off,” and warning: “No one should harbor any illusion that they can cross the line on the Taiwan issue without paying a price.”
    


            A social media account affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV asked: “Has her head been kicked by a donkey?”
    


            Hu Xijin, a Chinese pundit and former editor-in-chief of the state-run tabloid Global Times, offered a more violent warning, echoing the threats from the diplomat Xue.
    


            “China's battle blade for beheading invaders has been sharpened to a very keen edge,” he wrote in a post on Tuesday. “If Japanese militarism wishes to come to the Taiwan Strait to sacrifice themselves on our blades, we will fulfill them.”
    


            Takaichi said Monday that her comments were “hypothetical,” and said she would avoid making similar comments in parliament again. But the prime minister is walking a tightrope every Japanese leader has had to balance.
    


            China remains Japan's largest trading partner, and Takaichi inherited a country facing mounting economic woes. At the same time, Takaichi is known for her hardline conservative views, like her mentor former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. She has pushed to strengthen Japan's defense capacity and criticized Beijing's growing military presence in the region.
    


            This uneasy relationship was on display when Takaichi met Xi at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in late October. The two leaders agreed to build a “strategic mutually beneficial relationship,” Takaichi said afterward; however, she also raised with Xi the hot-button issue of China's activity in the East China Sea, including around islands claimed by both countries.
    


            Even before she took office, Takaichi's stance on Taiwan was clear. She visited the island earlier this year and called for cooperation on “defense challenges,” which Beijing condemned at the time. During the APEC summit, she also met with Taiwan's representative, again angering China.
    


            The current spat comes during a year when Japan-China relations are already strained, in part because of Tokyo's colonial and war-time past.
    


            September marked the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, which Beijing commemorated with a massive military parade. There's longstanding historical hostility between the two countries; China was a crucial Allied partner, fighting against Japan's full-scale invasion that ended only with Tokyo's formal surrender in 1945.
    


            The scars of that era run deep. Japanese Imperial troops killed more than 200,000 unarmed men and civilians, and raped and tortured tens of thousands of women and girls, in what is known as the Nanjing Massacre – one of the most notorious wartime atrocities of the 20th century.
    


            Ahead of the parade, Chinese officials ramped up their rhetoric and accused Japan of whitewashing history. Adding fuel to the fire, China also released at least four WWII films this year, including some that depict the Nanjing Massacre and the sinking of a Japanese vessel.
    


            Fearing a spike in anti-Japanese sentiment ahead of the parade, the Japanese embassy in Beijing warned its citizens to stay cautious and avoid speaking Japanese loudly in public – perhaps mindful that in recent years, there has been a spate of violent attacks against Japanese nationals in China.
    


            That complex history involves Taiwan, too.
    


            The island was once a Japanese colony that Imperial China had ceded to Imperial Japan. After Japan was defeated in WWII, China's ruling Nationalists took control of Taiwan – then, several years later, fled to the island and moved their seat of government there after losing a bloody civil war to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
    


            Today, the CCP views the self-ruling island as its own territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to seize it by force if necessary. Party leaders and state media have repeatedly claimed that the end of WWII marked the island's return to Chinese rule and liberation from Japanese occupation – a view Chinese officials alluded to this week as they berated Takaichi.
    


            “Japan holds historical responsibility towards the Chinese people regarding the Taiwan issue, having committed unmentionable crimes during the 50 years of colonial rule over Taiwan,” said Chen Binhua, a spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, on Wednesday when asked about Takaichi's comments.
    


            “Eighty years ago, we defeated the Japanese aggressors, restored Taiwan, and ended their occupation and plunder,” he said.
    


            “Should anyone again attempt to challenge China's core interests” or thwart reunification with Taiwan, Chen said, Beijing “will never accept or tolerate it.”

Last month, a former Chinese intelligence officer known as Eric publicly accused Chen Zhi, the Cambodian-Chinese tycoon behind the Prince Holding Group, of secretly collaborating with China's security apparatus.

Posting on X, Eric, currently based in Australia, alleged that Chen maintained close ties with senior officials in the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) Ministry of State Security and Ministry of Public Security, and that his sprawling business conglomerate had become a covert instrument for the regime's global operations.

“The Prince Group was not a target of China's anti-corruption campaign,” Eric said. “It was a deeply entangled partner.”

He said that he witnessed Chinese officials from Beijing and Chongqing holding secret meetings at Chen's private club in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh. “These officials met there to conspire to lure and arrest the exiled cartoonist Wang Liming,” he said, “and the entire meeting, from transportation to hospitality, was arranged by the Prince Group.”

Eric said he also saw Chen pleading with his former superior, asking China's Public Security Ministry to “make concessions” on his behalf.

“The company has become the financial reservoir and logistical base for China's intelligence system,” he said.

According to him, China's intelligence network operates under a principle known as “using business to support intelligence,” a military-derived doctrine that leverages commercial enterprises to fund and conceal espionage work.

Prosecutors said Chen led an international criminal enterprise operating under the guise of legitimate business. FBI Director Kash Patel described the operation as “one of the largest financial fraud takedowns in history,” after seizing $15 billion in bitcoin linked to the network.

Behind its commercial facade, the Prince Group maintained multiple compounds in Cambodia where trafficked workers were held captive and forced to conduct online investment scams, according to Eric. Victims' passports were confiscated, and they were threatened with violence.

Chen's rapid ascent in Cambodia was fueled by political patronage and connections to China. Born in China's Fujian Province, he later became a Cambodian citizen, receiving a prestigious civilian honor in the country, the Neak Oknha title, in 2020.

Soon afterward, he was appointed as an adviser to then Prime Minister Hun Sen, a position he has maintained under the current administration. Those positions provided both political cover and legitimacy for his alleged hidden activities, according to Eric.

Before the seizure, the FBI says Chen spent lavishly on yachts, private jets, luxury watches, and artwork, including a Picasso painting. One of his London office buildings, worth nearly £100 million, has been frozen by the British authorities.

Chen's co-conspirators, Prince Group's top executives, also allegedly used connections to Chinese law enforcement to bribe and influence local Cambodian police to extort businesses on behalf of Prince Group. In 2019, his associates purchased items worth over $3 million for a senior foreign official, the civil complaint stated.

“In an authoritarian system,” Zhang said, “those who hold power must be held responsible for what happens under their jurisdiction. The connection between Chen and the CCP's top leadership corresponds to specific levels within the power hierarchy, and those levels should bear responsibility for the crimes that occurred.”

Chen Zhi is now on the run. The federal government has frozen his assets in London and imposed sanctions on six individuals and six companies tied to him. If convicted on all charges, Chen could face up to 40 years in prison.

Romania aims to take control over the local subsidiary of Russia's Lukoil in order to protect its national energy system and comply with U.S. sanctions, Romanian Energy Minister Bogdan Ivan said on Nov. 11.

Lukoil operates 320 gas stations in Romania, manages the Petrotel refinery (which supplies about a quarter of the country's fuel market), and holds exploration rights in a section of the Black Sea.

The company, alongside Rosneft, was recently targeted by U.S. sanctions linked to Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, set to take effect on Nov. 21.

Ivan said Romania would not seek an extension of the sanctions deadline, adding that Bucharest supports enforcement of the recent U.S. measures. “I will support fully applying sanctions initiated by the United States at the level of the entire European Union," he said.

He noted that the Energy Ministry is drafting legislation to maintain refinery operations and fuel supply stability while complying with sanctions.

The government has yet to clarify which of Lukoil's assets would be taken under state control or how the process would unfold. 

Lukoil and Rosneft are critical parts of Russia's economy. Kyiv has long encouraged its allies to sanction Russia's energy sector, arguing that depriving Moscow of oil revenues would limit its ability to finance its war against Ukraine.

A carrier ship docked at LNG Canada's export facility in Kitimat, B.C., on Aug. 19.Jesse Winter/Reuters

A wave of liquefied natural gas development is set to double global supplies by the end of the decade, with around 300 billion cubic metres of new annual export capacity scheduled to come online, according to a new analysis from the International Energy Agency. 

That's the largest ever global addition to LNG capacity, some of which will come from Canada. 

The new LNG Canada terminal in Kitimat, B.C., only began exporting the fuel in June. But the country's trajectory for natural gas production – set to rise by roughly 35 billion cubic metres (bcm) to 250 bcm by 2035 – puts it on course to cement its “entrance to the club of LNG exporters,” said the IEA's World Energy Outlook 2025, released Thursday. 

Natural gas has been a focus for the federal government as part of Prime Minister Mark Carney's bid to make Canada an energy superpower. Expansion of the LNG Canada facility was on the first list of projects that will be reviewed for fast-track approval under Ottawa's Building Canada Act; on Monday, Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne called the project a “game changer.” 

LNG Canada project underlines change in public opinion on energy sector, Champagne says

In its 2025 report, the Paris-based IEA outlined outcomes under three scenarios: current policies, stated policies and policies put in place to bring emissions to net-zero by 2050. 

Under current government policies, the new supply of LNG will be absorbed “relatively quickly by robust increases in demand,” the report said. Similarly, under stated policies, a well-supplied global gas market remains into the 2030s. 

In the net-zero scenario, however, global demand and prices are much lower. Both will remain significantly below 2024 levels by 2035 as the rapid expansion of renewables and electrification limits gas demand growth, despite abundant availability of the fossil fuel.

Common among all scenarios, however, is that the world will have ample supplies of oil and gas in the near term, owing to a “quintet of producers in the Americas – the United States, Canada, Guyana, Brazil and Argentina – and muted demand growth,” the report said.

Tony Keller: Does Canada need a new oil pipeline? Maybe. More LNG? Definitely

The world's growing need for energy, particularly for emerging economies in India and Southeast Asia, is also set to continue under all scenarios.

Countries in those regions will increasingly shape energy market dynamics in the years ahead, the report said. They are set to take the baton from China, which has accounted for half of global oil and gas demand growth and 60 per cent of electricity demand growth since 2010. 

But the surging demand for energy of all kinds comes amid an uncertain geopolitical landscape, which could place the security of supplies in a precarious spot. 

“When we look at the history of the energy world in recent decades, there is no other time when energy security tensions have applied to so many fuels and technologies at once,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a statement. 

With energy security front and centre for many governments, he said, responses need to consider affordability, access, competitiveness and climate change in a data-driven way. 

That's particularly true for electricity. 

Opinion: Canada, don't make the same mistake with LNG that Australia did

The annual report has for years flagged increasing global demand for electricity, but in 2025, it said that demand has reached “breakneck growth” owing to surging investment in data centres – a sector expected to reach US$580-billion in 2025. 

“In a break from the trend of the past decade, the increase in electricity consumption is no longer limited to emerging and developing economies,” Dr. Birol said.

“Those who say that ‘data is the new oil' will note that this surpasses the US$540-billion being spent on global oil supply – a striking example of the changing nature of modern economies.”

Yet the world continues to fall short on action to avoid the worst effects of climate change, the analysis found; even with rapid action to reduce emissions, the planet is set to surpass 1.5 degrees of warming, failing the target laid out in the Paris Agreement. 

On a more hopeful note, the report said there is still scope to avoid the worst climate outcomes, if the world reaches net-zero emissions by mid-century. Doing so would bring temperatures back below 1.5 degrees in the long term, it said.

 China Gains From New Delhi's Support for South Asian Autocrats

 Muhib Rahman

In September 2025, tens of thousands of young protesters poured into the streets of Kathmandu and stormed Nepal's Parliament. They were furious about entrenched corruption and opposed recent attempts to clamp down on free speech and dissent through a social media blackout. Although the authorities killed numerous demonstrators, the uprising forced the resignation of Nepalese Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli and the installation of an interim government. Nepal, however, is only the latest example of a broader trend in South Asia. In 2024, a youth-led uprising ended the 15-year rule of Sheikh Hasina as prime minister of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka witnessed repeated waves of mass demonstrations, most dramatically in 2022, resulting in the ouster of a corrupt government. And in the Maldives, discontent over corruption, democratic backsliding, and polarizing foreign entanglements have led to similar protests demanding political change.

The uprisings across the region stem from domestic grievances, but that isn't the whole story. For years, India has embraced the notion that it is the world's largest democracy. It has championed liberal values and accepted the role—bestowed by the United States—of the Indo-Pacific's democratic linchpin. Yet when it comes to dealings in its own neighborhood, India has often behaved in decidedly illiberal ways, propping up autocratic regimes and meddling in the affairs of other sovereign countries. New Delhi has treated democratic ideals and human rights as expendable whenever its own strategic interests are at stake.

The United States, wary of alienating its key Indo-Pacific partner, rarely challenges India on how it manages its backyard. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter announced that the United States would defer to India in most matters to do with South Asia. Every U.S. administration since has echoed that policy of deference. New Delhi has propped up neighboring governments by bankrolling them, lobbying the West on their behalf, or deploying its security forces. In return, Washington has often stayed silent about any indiscretions it sees, retreating from the promotion of democracy when such an effort might clash with India's preferences.

As a result, smaller countries in South Asia view India as a regional hegemon, empowered to manipulate domestic politics with U.S. approval. This fuels resentment toward India and mistrust of the United States, catalysts for the kind of violent popular overthrow that has marked the subcontinent in recent years. Tellingly, the protesters in Nepal's September uprising angrily confronted Indian TV crews, associating them with the country's political crisis. This resentment not only threatens India but also creates fertile ground for the spread of Chinese influence. As South Asian publics have pushed back against governments closely aligned with New Delhi, Beijing has asserted itself, courting new regimes with loans and military hardware and stressing respect for their sovereignty.

South Asia's slide toward China has real consequences for Washington. As disillusioned governments draw closer to Beijing, the United States risks losing both influence and credibility in the region. This moment of flux calls for a reassessment of the U.S. relationship with New Delhi and the pursuit of a more balanced approach to South Asia—one that engages smaller neighbors as independent partners, not simply as appendages of India.

Nowhere has the contradiction between India's ostensible democratic principles and its support for autocrats been more glaring than in Bangladesh. For over a decade, India backed Hasina and her party, the Awami League, even as her rule grew more autocratic and as she retained power through controversial elections in 2014, 2018, and 2024. New Delhi's support enabled Hasina to undermine democratic institutions, politicize the judiciary and Election Commission, and enforce repressive laws such as the Digital Security Act, which limited free speech online and allowed arbitrary arrests and detentions of opponents of the regime.

Hasina's government helped India meet critical security objectives—notably, dismantling networks of anti-Indian insurgents that operated out of Bangladesh—and in return, India bolstered Bangladesh's authoritarian security apparatus. New Delhi provided diplomatic protection to the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), an elite Bangladeshi counterterrorism force that targeted opposition politicians, activists, and journalists. According to a 2023 report from Human Rights Watch, millions of Bangladeshis faced political persecution during Hasina's tenure, including arrests, prosecution, and violence. Indian officials frequently defended the actions of her government, insisting that it was a pillar of regional stability and a bulwark against terrorism. But New Delhi remained notably silent on the subject of domestic repression.

Public resentment toward India surged in response. In early 2024, the India Out movement flared, with widespread protests, boycotts of Indian-made goods, and powerful social media campaigns. The Bangladeshi government's brutal suppression of a student-led uprising in mid-2024, which according to the UN resulted in as many as 1,400 deaths, intensified public outrage. These demonstrations snowballed into mass protests that encouraged the country's military to abandon Hasina and toppled her government, forcing her to flee. Her exile in India exacerbated tensions with the interim government in Bangladesh, which has since held New Delhi at arm's length.



Before Hasina's ouster, the United States didn't do much to check the course of democratic backsliding in Bangladesh. It deferred, as it often has, to India's priorities. U.S. officials expressed concerns about irregularities in the 2014 and 2018 Bangladeshi elections but took little concrete action, yielding to India in its backing of Hasina. The Biden administration was the most assertive, imposing sanctions on the RAB in 2021 and, in 2023, implementing visa restrictions on Bangladeshi officials and political figures it deemed responsible for undermining elections. Still, the U.S. administration tempered its public criticism and held back broader penalties. Wary of straining ties with India, it acknowledged that Bangladesh's 2024 elections were “not free or fair” but avoided any stronger reproach.

Bangladeshi civil society welcomed rhetorical support for its democracy but was demoralized by Washington's reluctance to act decisively. After Hasina's government fell, China swiftly moved in. In October 2024, Chinese warships visited Chittagong—the first foreign naval vessels to do so after the establishment of the interim Bangladeshi government—signaling a major geopolitical shift. Significant diplomatic and military visits followed, as well as Chinese support for Bangladesh's involvement in naval exercises with Pakistan (a longtime Indian rival), Chinese defense technology transfers, and Chinese investment in infrastructure and economic zones. By mid-2025, the two countries had opened discussions on defense and free trade, and Bangladesh joined China and Pakistan for a trilateral summit in June after restoring diplomatic ties with the latter. This was a decisive turn away from Hasina's India-first posture and toward closer alignment with Beijing. The interim government turned to China and Pakistan to rebalance Bangladesh's options and secure tangible gains in defense cooperation and economic assistance. China's expanding role in Bangladesh is thus not merely opportunistic—it is the outcome of Washington's habitual deference to New Delhi. By failing to challenge India's support for an autocratic regime, the United States inadvertently opened the door for China.

A similar process unfolded in the Maldives, an archipelago country where domestic discontent over Indian influence led to a change in government and, subsequently, greater Chinese involvement. The outcome offered further evidence that prioritizing short-term stability over democratic values and accountable governance can invite long-term reversals, a trend that Washington and New Delhi would do well to reckon with.

After Abdulla Yameen became president of the Maldives in 2013, India treated him as an important ally, prioritizing military and surveillance cooperation with the government in Male even as Yameen became more authoritarian. By 2016, New Delhi had deepened its defense ties with Yameen's government, hosting him with high honors and signing agreements that made India the Maldives' primary security partner. Meanwhile, Yameen dismantled democratic institutions, jailing opposition leaders (including former President Mohamed Nasheed), manipulating the judiciary, and declaring states of emergency in 2015 and 2018 that allowed him to concentrate his power and silence dissent. In 2016, as the Commonwealth moved to censure the Maldives, New Delhi provided diplomatic cover by making the case for engagement over sanctions and supporting the Maldives' preemptive withdrawal from the organization. For many Maldivians, this was tantamount to India tacitly approving of repression.

But in 2018, Yameen was voted out of power. The Maldives' own India Out campaign—paradoxically led by Yameen after his electoral defeat to the pro-Indian politician Ibrahim Mohamed Solih—gained traction, casting India as a neoimperial power. By 2022, nationalist rhetoric from Yameen and his Progressive Party coalition intensified into a demand for the expulsion of the Indian troops stationed in the country. The movement helped propel Mohamed Muizzu, an opposition candidate from the anti-Indian People's National Congress, to a surprise victory in the 2023 presidential election. Framing his win as a reclamation of sovereignty, Muizzu expelled Indian troops and canceled defense agreements with New Delhi, abruptly ending decades of security cooperation between the two countries. A visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Male in July 2025 (his first since Muizzu took office) eased tensions somewhat, with the two leaders launching trade talks and opening a $565 million credit line for the Maldives in a shift toward a renewed economic partnership. But trust between New Delhi and Male remains thin, with the partnership yet to return to its former strength.



Despite the Maldives sitting along key sea-lanes, the United States has long treated the country as a footnote in its Indo-Pacific strategy. Washington delegated diplomatic responsibility for the Maldives to India, issuing no sanctions in response to democratic backsliding and refraining from penalizing Yameen as he undermined democratic institutions. As the anti-India movement in the Maldives gained momentum, China exploited the United States' absence, rapidly expanding its regional footprint by easing the tremendous debt the island country owed China. In January 2024, Muizzu visited Beijing and signed agreements spanning infrastructure, trade, fisheries, and digital connectivity.

In response, the Biden administration's secretary of state, Antony Blinken, attempted diplomatic damage control, hosting Maldivian Foreign Minister Moosa Zameer in Washington in June 2024 and extending offers of U.S. security and naval cooperation. Still, the gesture paled in comparison with what China offered: military assistance in the form of grants, hardware, and training, as well as a free trade agreement that included major infrastructure projects. The perception of Western indifference had hardened among Maldivians, who saw the U.S. overtures as reactions to Chinese regional influence rather than genuine efforts to support autonomy, democracy, and human rights in their country. Without convincing support for political transparency, democratic institutions, and a free civil society, U.S. attempts to engage the Maldives appeared to be mere geopolitical scheming.

The arc of discontent evident in Bangladesh and the Maldives, where Indian meddling has produced Chinese gains, is also visible in Sri Lanka. India emerged as a critical ally for Sri Lanka in the wake of the latter's civil war, which ended in 2009 with the defeat of the insurgent Tamil Tigers. As in Bangladesh and the Maldives, however, this support came at the expense of human rights and accountability. At a special session of the UN Human Rights Council that year, India voted in favor of a resolution praising Sri Lanka's victory and seeking to block Western calls for an investigation into alleged war crimes.

New Delhi continued to deflect international pressure from Sri Lanka in the years that followed, shielding Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa from meaningful global scrutiny and allowing him to consolidate power while dismissing Tamil grievances as Western propaganda. Meetings between Modi and Rajapaksa in subsequent years focused on security and counterterrorism strategy, sidestepping human rights issues. New Delhi's calculated leniency sent a clear signal: if the Sri Lankan government stayed aligned with India on regional security, India would not press it on past atrocities or its persecution of minorities.

By 2022, however, Sri Lanka faced economic collapse. Mismanagement by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Mahinda Rajapaksa's brother who was elected in 2019, triggered mass protests. New Delhi, in response, provided nearly $4 billion in condition-free assistance through credit lines, currency swaps, and emergency aid. India became Sri Lanka's de facto lender of last resort without requiring the Sri Lankan government to address concerns about the human rights abuses, militarization, or corruption that fueled the country's political crisis. But the bailout merely delayed the inevitable. Protesters stormed the palace in July 2022, forcing Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee. Much of the Sri Lankan public saw India as complicit in preserving a failing regime, and protesters spray-painted “India Out” on the walls of the presidential palace. Rajapaksa's successor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, turned to China for support. Beijing responded with alacrity, granting a two-year moratorium on debt repayments and, with the approval of the Sri Lankan government, advancing a $4.5 billion oil refinery project in Hambantota, one of the largest foreign investments in Sri Lanka's history. Once operational, the refinery will anchor a Chinese logistics hub just 180 miles from India's coast.

As the chaos unfolded, the United States expressed concern about Sri Lanka's democratic backsliding but largely followed India's lead. While Washington supported UN efforts to investigate wartime human rights abuses and provided humanitarian aid to Sri Lanka during the economic crisis in 2022, it did not press for the establishment of governance benchmarks or anticorruption safeguards from the Sri Lankan government, either through Indian cooperation or otherwise. U.S. officials praised India's financial lending but stayed quiet about the lack of accountability. Many Sri Lankans, especially the young protesters, viewed both New Delhi and Washington as responsible for the persistence of a corrupt old regime.

Like its South Asian peers, Nepal has watched for decades as India prioritized its regional influence over promoting local democracy, a policy that has exacerbated political upheavals in a country that has seen 14 different governments in the last 17 years. Although much of the country's instability is rooted in its internal fractiousness and troubled transition from monarchy to republican democracy, many Nepalis believe India's meddling has deepened their endemic political crisis.

New Delhi, for instance, imposed a blockade from late 2015 to early 2016 to punish Kathmandu for a constitutional change that affected Indian communities on the Nepali side of the border. At the time, the blockades crippled transportation routes and hospital services and prompted international warnings about a humanitarian crisis in the country, which was reeling from a devastating earthquake. Tensions between India and Nepal worsened. In 2020, the emergence of the #BackOffIndia social media campaign reflected a growing impatience among young Nepalis with New Delhi's overbearing influence and supposed sympathies for the royalist camp within Nepali politics. In 2025, protesters were not just rejecting oligarchic rot, but also reaffirming their long-standing frustration over India's role in sustaining it.

Washington has long seen Nepal as merely part of India's backyard, and therefore limits its involvement to aid projects and disaster relief while avoiding deeper diplomatic initiatives that might irk New Delhi. The only serious U.S. engagement with the country is the $500 million Millennium Challenge Corporation compact, which has funded major electricity transmission lines and road upgrades. To many Nepalis, however, the compact looked like a plan hatched in New Delhi to cement both Indian and U.S. authority in South Asia. Opponents of the agreement rallied outside the Parliament building in February 2022 and burned both American and Indian flags in protest.

These strained relations, and Nepal's domestic instability, opened the door for China to expand its influence in the country. In 2017, Nepal joined the Belt and Road Initiative, China's vast infrastructure investment program. It has since hosted a number of slow-moving Chinese-backed projects: the Kathmandu-Kerung railway, oil and gas exploration in the Dailekh district, and the cross-border economic corridor known as the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network, which forms part of the BRI. Chinese trade with Nepal is growing quickly, and Beijing touts the no-strings loans it has extended to Kathmandu. Even before he was forced from office, Oli began to hew closer to China, breaking protocol in 2024 by visiting Beijing before New Delhi to revive dormant rail talks and security coordination. Thus far, the interim government has signaled that it will maintain this China-friendly orientation while cautiously advancing domestic calls for accountability and autonomy.

Across South Asia, the pattern is clear: India prioritizes its narrow strategic interests over upholding democratic and liberal values. Washington, wary of straining its ties with New Delhi, looks the other way. Local populations view the dynamic as emblematic of U.S.-sponsored Indian hegemony, and the grievances pave the way for greater Chinese investment and influence. These are not isolated outcomes, but structural ones. South Asian democracies are battlegrounds for great-power rivalry. The more India interferes with democratic processes or props up unpopular strongmen, the wider the opening becomes for China. And as long as Washington continues to adopt a regional policy that defers to—and unthinkingly endorses—Indian preferences, it risks ceding South Asia to Beijing.

The remedy is not for Washington to micromanage India's neighborhood policy but to forge a shared democratic baseline for cooperation. If the world's two largest democracies cannot reconcile their geopolitical strategies with the democratic values they claim to share, China will continue to make strategic gains amid the wreckage that Indian and U.S. policies produce.

This is a prime moment for Washington to reassess its approach to South Asia. The U.S.-Indian partnership has been shaken in Trump's second term, with Washington slapping high tariffs on New Delhi ostensibly because of the latter's purchases of oil from Moscow. As U.S. officials determine what kind of partnership they want with India, they should change the way they look at the broader region. It is not simply India's backyard, but a series of independent partners home to hundreds of millions of people. Listening to local voices, setting clear standards for transparency and human rights, and responding firmly to breaches of those standards—including by India—will be key to making deals in South Asia that can last. If Washington does not want to see Chinese influence expand irrevocably in the region, it must stop deferring to India. Instead, it should take seriously the democratic aspirations of all South Asian states and remember that their citizens will not countenance repression and bad governance—especially when it is sponsored by the world's largest democracy.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen is questioning why the Trump administration sent money to Equatorial Guinea, which she describes as one of the world's most corrupt countries.Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images

The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has made a “highly unusual” payment of US$7.5-million to the small oil-rich country of Equatorial Guinea in a covert deal allowing Washington to send deported migrants there, a Democratic senator says.

Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democratic senator on the Senate foreign relations committee, disclosed the payment in a letter this week and questioned why the Trump administration was transferring U.S. money to what she describes as one of the world's most corrupt countries.

Equatorial Guinea has been ruled for 46 years by President Teodoro Obiang, who seized power in a military coup. His son and vice-president, known as Teodorin or Teddy, has made headlines for his playboy lifestyle and expensive spending habits, including his purchases of luxury yachts, Ferrari sports cars, a Malibu mansion and a US$275,000 jewel-studded glove that once belonged to Michael Jackson.

Despite the country's vast oil and gas wealth, its multibillion-dollar assets are monopolized by a small elite, while two-thirds of its 1.5 million people live below the poverty line of about US$2 a day. Critics of the government, including civil-society activists, have often been arrested and imprisoned.

In her letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio this week, Ms. Shaheen expressed “serious concerns” about the deportation deal and asked whether the administration has done anything to ensure that the money will not facilitate corruption, human trafficking or human rights abuses.

The agreement with Equatorial Guinea is the latest in a series of Trump administration deals with African and Latin American governments, in which they agree to accept deportees from the United States who are citizens of other countries. But the deal with Equatorial Guinea is a rare case where a U.S. politician has disclosed details of the payment.

The administration has not commented publicly on the agreement, but Ms. Shaheen said the payment was made directly to Equatorial Guinea's government by the U.S. State Department.

She called it a “stark departure” from previous U.S. assistance to the African country, which hasn't climbed above US$2-million annually in recent years. The latest payment “would far exceed the amount of U.S. foreign assistance provided over the last eight years combined,” she said in the letter.

Trump faces backlash over African deportation deals

Ms. Shaheen said the payment was financed by the U.S. government's migration and refugee program – the first time such funds have been given directly to a foreign government, rather than to a non-governmental group.

Human rights groups have criticized the Trump administration's deals with foreign countries, noting that the deported migrants often lose their access to legal counsel and end up isolated in remote prisons without any way to seek release.

Most of the African countries that have struck deportation deals with the Trump administration are authoritarian regimes such as South Sudan, Rwanda and the kingdom of Eswatini.

Ms. Shaheen, in her letter to Mr. Rubio, said she is worried that any migrants deported to Equatorial Guinea could be sent to Black Beach prison, an island jail that is widely known as one of Africa's most feared prisons, notorious for its brutal conditions.

She also quoted the U.S. State Department's latest report on human trafficking, which described bribery in Equatorial Guinea's judicial system and the involvement of senior officials in exploiting women and girls in human trafficking crimes.

Rwanda will accept up to 250 deportees from the U.S. under Trump's third-country program

Teodorin Obiang, seen as the likely successor to his 83-year-old father as the country's president, regularly flaunts his lavish lifestyle on Instagram, where he posts photos of himself at European beach resorts or on private jets.

In a case in France in 2017, he was convicted of embezzling and laundering tens of millions of euros. Many of his assets have been seized by authorities in Switzerland and France after corruption investigations, and he is under sanctions or visa restrictions in several countries, including the United States and Britain, because of the graft cases.

Ms. Shaheen, in her letter, noted that the U.S. Justice Department had filed a civil asset forfeiture case against Teodorin Obiang in 2011 after determining that he had amassed more than US$300-million in assets from corruption and money laundering. The department eventually reached a deal to seize nearly US$30-million in assets from him – including some of his Michael Jackson memorabilia.

Despite the sanctions and asset seizures, senior U.S. officials have been keen to curry favour with Teodorin Obiang, holding several meetings with him in recent years. They have been seeking to counteract Chinese influence in Equatorial Guinea, where China reportedly wants to build a naval base – its first on the Atlantic Ocean.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Approval of the way President Donald Trump is managing the government has dropped sharply since early in his second term, according to a new AP-NORC poll, with much of the rising discontent coming from fellow Republicans.

The survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research was conducted after Democrats' recent victories in off-year elections but before Congress took major steps to try to end the longest shutdown in U.S. history. It shows that only 33% of U.S. adults approve of the way the Republican president is managing the government, down from 43% in an AP-NORC poll from March.

That was driven in large part by a decline in approval among Republicans and independents. According to the survey, only about two-thirds of Republicans, 68%, said they approve of Trump's government management, down from 81% in March. Independents' approval dropped from 38% to 25%.




The results highlight the risks posed by the shutdown, which Trump and his administration have tried to pin squarely on Democrats, even as U.S. adults have cast blame on both parties as the funding lapse has snarled air traffic, left hundreds of thousands of federal workers without paychecks and compromised food aid for some of the most vulnerable Americans. But it could also indicate broader discontent with Trump's other dramatic — and polarizing — changes to the federal government in recent months, including gutting agencies and directing waves of mass layoffs.




Republicans have generally been steadfast in their support for the president, making their growing displeasure particularly notable.

“I'm thoroughly disturbed by the government shutdown for 40-something days,” said Beverly Lucas, 78, a Republican and retired educator who lives in Ormond Beach, Florida, and compared Trump's second term to “having a petulant child in the White House, with unmitigated power.”

“When people are hungry, he had a party,” she said, referring to a Great Gatsby-themed Halloween party held at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. “I thought he seems callous.”

The survey found an overwhelming majority of Democrats, 95%, continue to disapprove of Trump's management of the federal government, compared with 89% in March.

Even with the decline in support for his management of the government, Trump's overall approval rating has remained steady in the new poll. About one-third of U.S. adults, 36%, approve of his overall handling of the presidency, roughly in line with 37% in an October AP-NORC poll. Approval of his handling of key issues like immigration and the economy have also barely changed since last month.




Health care emerged as a key issue in the shutdown debate as Democrats demanded that Republicans negotiate with them to extend tax credits that expire Jan. 1. But Trump's approval on the issue, which was already fairly low, has barely changed.

About one-third, 34%, of Americans said they approved of Trump's handling of health care in the November poll, compared with 31% in October. 

And many of his supporters are still behind him. Susan McDuffie, 74, a Republican who lives in Carson City, Nevada, and retired several years ago, said she has “great confidence in Trump” and thinks the country is on the right track. She blames Democrats for the shutdown and the suffering it's caused.

“I just don't understand how the Democrats can care so little about the people,” she said, scoffing at the idea that Democrats were trying to use the shutdown to force Republicans to address soon-to-skyrocket health care costs.

“I don't have any patience for the Democrats and their lame excuses,” she said, arguing that people who are scared about SNAP benefits expiring and struggling to put food on the table are a more pressing issue. 

When it comes to the shutdown, there is still plenty of blame to go around. Recent polls have indicated that while Republicans may be taking slightly more heat, many think Democrats are at fault, too.

“I truly do believe it's everybody. Everybody is being stubborn,” said Nora Bailey, 33, a moderate who lives in the Batesville area in Arkansas and does not align with either party.

After recently giving birth, she said, she faced delays in getting a breast pump through a government program that helps new mothers while her son was in intensive care. And she is worried about her disabled parents, who rely on SNAP food stamp benefits.

Overall, she said she is mixed on Trump's handling of the job and disapproves of his management of the federal government because she believes he has not gone far enough to tackle waste.

“I don't see enough being done yet to tell me we have downsized the federal government instead of having all these excess people,” she said.

It's possible that Trump's approval on handling the federal government will rebound if the government reopens. But the showdown could have a more lasting impact on perceptions of the president, whose approval on the economy and immigration has eroded slightly since the spring.

Lucas, the Florida Republican, said shutdowns in which civilians aren't paid are the wrong way to address ideological disagreement.

“Air traffic controllers? Really? You want to not pay the people in whose hands your lives are every day?” she said. “We need to be addressing these conflicts like intelligent people and not thugs and bullies on the playground.”

The AP-NORC poll of 1,143 adults was conducted Nov. 6-10 using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.

CHICAGO (AP) — The cyclists arrive at sunrise, rolling through Chicago's Latino neighborhoods and stopping at tamale carts, elote stands and candy stalls. They buy out every last item — every tamale, every corn cob, every bundle of sweets. Then they load up the food and deliver it to shelters and families in need.

Since the start of a federal immigration crackdown that has led to more than 3,200 arrests in the Chicago metropolitan area, streets and storefronts in the city's Latino neighborhoods have emptied out. Street vendors, fearing arrest, have been afraid to leave their homes to work. Local restaurants have struggled as customers stay home.

But as fear spread, so did something else — neighbors stepping up for one another and finding creative ways to show up for vendors and restaurant owners. This includes a grassroots effort to organize so-called “buy out” events meant to allow vendors who fear being detained by immigration agents to go home early. Some Chicagoans have pooled money in their neighborhoods or through local organizations while others have simply bought out taco stands while on their way to work or tamale vendors outside their local bars.

In Little Village, Rick Rosales, community organizer with Cycling x Solidarity, helps organize two of these “buy out” rides per week that typically support five street vendors each.

“The vendors are often speechless,” Rosales said. “They'll say, ‘I have a lot of tamales. You want all of them?'”

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Once, after the group bought out a tamale vendor's cart, that man found them days later to say immigration agents were spotted on his block just hours after. “You saved my life,” Rosales said the man told them.

“This is about food and joy and bike rides,” Rosales said. “But it's also so incredibly high stakes because of the fear in our communities right now.”

It's hard to say how many street vendors have been targeted by federal immigration agents, said Maria Orozco, outreach organizer for the Street Vendors Association of Chicago, adding she knows of at least 10 who have been detained.

In September, a tamale vendor was detained while selling outside a Home Depot, according to local advocates. Soon after, federal agents arrested a flower seller in the southwest neighborhood of Archer Heights. Then they came for a cotton candy vendor in the predominantly Mexican American Little Village. Immigration agents descended on the Swap-O-Rama flea market in October and detained more than a dozen people. And last week, over 100 residents in the Brighton Park neighborhood rallied to demand the release of their local tamalero.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Orozco said losing these vendors is as much a cultural loss as an economic one, calling them part of the “fabric of our city.” She said they bring life, color and flavor to the city's streets, preserving culinary traditions and building a sense of community — and they are beloved by neighbors.

Street vendors who are afraid to work or are seeing drops in sales can apply to get financial support through the Street Vendors Association of Chicago. The group launched a GoFundMe with the goal of raising $300,000 to support street vendors.

Orozco said local businesses have also hosted pop-up events where a certain percentage of proceeds go to street vendors. The organization has also helped connect vendors to people hoping to “buy them out,” Orozco said.

“It's been emotional to see,” she said. “The vendors themselves didn't realize how much Chicagoans love and support them. None of us expected this.”

As Alonso Zaragoza, executive administrator of his neighborhood advocacy group, drove through his predominantly Latino community of Belmont Cragin, he noticed restaurants were mostly empty and dark. Restaurants in majority-Latino communities have reported significant drops in sales since federal agents descended on the city in September.

So Zaragoza began organizing restaurant crawls, drawing hundreds to struggling Latino-owned eateries. His previous event began at a taco and tamales restaurant and ended with a Mexican ice cream shop. Along the way, street cart vendors hawked elote, cotton candy and balloons as a local musical group played folk and bluegrass music.

“The financial support for our businesses is needed more than ever now,” Zaragoza said. “It goes such a long way.”

Delilah Martinez, a community organizer and owner of the Vault Gallerie in Pilsen, couldn't stand the silence on her street anymore. She was used to seeing familiar faces on 18th Street — a woman selling candy with her baby strapped to her back, a paletero who smiled at her each afternoon. Then one week, they were gone.

“It broke my heart,” Martinez said. “The streets felt empty. Our people were putting their freedom at risk just to work.”

She began raising money online and started “Operation Buyout,” approaching vendors one by one to purchase everything they had. The first woman was shocked when Martinez handed her $500.

“I just wanted her to have a day of rest, a day without fear,” Martinez said.

Among those Martinez helped recently was a baker from Mexico City who arrived in Chicago 24 years ago.

Each night, he works late, hands dusted with flour, kneading dough until they're sore and aching. For those few quiet hours, after his four children are asleep, the world feels simpler.

“There is a magic when I'm baking,” he said in Spanish. “I feel free. When I'm angry, I feel like the bread will absorb it. So I try to be happy and at peace, even when I know the reality is different.”

By 3 a.m., he's up again for his grocery store shift, juggling work and school drop-offs. For years, he's sold birthday cakes and pan dulce “by word of mouth” from his small kitchen, dreaming of one day opening his own shop.

But the baker has also heard the stories: street vendors arrested on residential streets and federal agents circling his historically Mexican American neighborhood of Pilsen. Two of his friends have been detained. When he hears sirens and helicopters, he feels “sick with fear.”

“I'm afraid for my youngest daughter,” he said. “It would be horrible to leave her. … I can't see myself without my children.”

Martinez led the baker to a table and pulled off a black cloth. A silver, restaurant-grade mixer gleamed under the fluorescent light. Martinez also handed him an envelope with $1,500 gathered from neighbors hoping to help support him when he feels unsafe selling his baked goods on the street.

The man's hand flew up to cover his mouth. He kicked his legs and began to cry.

LONDON (AP) — He's lost his titles, his house and his reputation, but the former Prince Andrew has gained a hyphen.

The disgraced royal is now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and not – as previously announced – Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.

The change makes the name's style conform to the double-barreled surname chosen by the late Queen Elizabeth II for her descendants 65 years ago.

It combines the royal family's name of Windsor, chosen by King George V in 1917, with Mountbatten, the surname of the queen's husband, Prince Philip.

The queen had initially decided to use Windsor alone, leading her husband to complain that he was the only man in England not allowed to give his children his name.

Elizabeth relented, and in an official declaration on Feb. 8, 1960 — days before her son Andrew was born — said: “My descendants other than descendants enjoying the style title or attribute of Royal Highness and the titular dignity of Prince or Princess and female descendants who marry and their descendants shall bear the name of Mountbatten-Windsor.”

The hyphen has been added after palace officials studied the 1960 declaration.

King Charles III announced on Oct. 30 that he was removing his brother's titles and evicting him from his royal residence near Windsor Castle over his relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Pressure had been growing on the palace to oust the 65-year-old prince from his Royal Lodge home over new revelations about his friendship with Epstein and renewed attention on sexual abuse allegations by one of Epstein's victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, whose posthumous memoir was published last month.

The king went even further to punish Mountbatten-Windsor for serious lapses of judgment by removing the title of prince that he had held since birth.

Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied Giuffre's allegations.

The daughter of Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is standing behind the National Football League's (NFL) decision to tap Bad Bunny to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show, which has garnered criticism due to what critics argue is the performer's anti-American brand. 

Charlotte Jones, who runs the famed Dallas Cowboys cheerleading team, called the NFL's choice to tap Bad Bunny "awesome" and "amazing." The United States is a society "based on immigrants that have come here and founded our country" and "we can celebrate that," Jones added during a podcast interview on "The Katie Miller Podcast" hosted by Katie Miller, the wife of top Trump aid Stephen Miller. Jones also argued during the podcast segment that football aims to "avoid politics," despite Bad Bunny's politically polarizing brand. 

"I think it's awesome, and I think our Latina fan base is amazing. And I think when you think about the Super Bowl you want the number one performer in the world to be there. We're on a global stage – and we can't ever forget that – our game goes out to everybody around the world. And to get the premier entertainer to want to be a part of our game, I think is amazing," Jones said when asked for her opinion about the selection of Bad Bunny for the Super Bowl halftime show.

"We have a mixed culture. I mean our whole society is based on immigrants that have come here and founded our country, and I think we can celebrate that, and I think the show is going to be amazing," she continued.

However, Miller did not let Jones off easy, saying, "You don't think that at a time when his comments were divisive as it relates to President Trump, when everyone is just seeking this political unification, that you'd want somebody who maybe didn't touch politics to be on that stage?" 

"I don't think our game is about politics. I don't think people tune in to look at politics. We do everything we can to avoid politics," Jones shot back. "I think, in that moment, that people will be watching the game, they'll be celebrating music, and nobody will be thinking about whose – what's comments on the left side, what comments on the right side. This is about bringing people together."

But, while Jones argues that the Super Bowl is not about politics, it certainly has been for Bad Bunny.

The Puerto Rican-born artist, for example, has made politically driven touring choices. He committed ahead of his 2025-2026 tour to no stops in the United States, which the performer explained was due, at least in part, because of the country's crackdown on immigration. Bad Bunny, who performs the majority of his songs in Spanish, said he was protecting his fans from being nabbed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials while attending his shows.

The soon-to-be Super Bowl halftime performer also explained that one of the reasons for not touring in the United States was because Puerto Rico, where he is from, is still not a state. But, at the same time, he has complained about ICE enforcement operations in the U.S. jurisdiction.  

"Look, those motherf---ers are in these cars, RAV4s. They're here on [Avenida] Pontezuela," the performer said of U.S. immigration officials arriving in the Puerto Rican city of Carolina, according to the Los Angeles Times. He lamented that they were going around arresting illegal immigrants "instead of leaving the people alone and working."

Meanwhile, the performer also endorsed Kamala Harris for president before she lost to Donald Trump.

Puerto Rican musician Bad Bunny sparked a litany of split conversation upon the announcement of his Super Bowl halftime show in 2026.

After Bad Bunny was selected by the NFL to be this year's halftime show, several rumors began circulating that multiple teams, including Jones' father's Cowboys, had petitioned the NFL to pick a new halftime performer. However, no formal announcements were put out by any teams making such demands, according to fact-checkers.

The NFL has said they will not amend their choice, with the league's commissioner, Roger Goodell, stating the decision had been "carefully thought through." 

"I'm not sure we've ever selected an artist where we didn't have some blowback or criticism," Goodell said. "It's pretty hard to do when you have literally hundreds of millions of people that are watching."

Manhattan Institute fellow Daniel Di Martino, who faces losing his Venezuelan citizenship, discusses Nicolás Maduro's plan to target opposition activists and President Donald Trump's denial that he is considering strikes within the country.

As President Donald Trump warns of "zero tolerance" for narco-states in America's backyard, China is tightening its grip on Venezuela — a high-risk economic and political bet that could soon collide with U.S. power.

U.S. defense officials confirmed to Reuters last month that a U.S. aircraft carrier strike group had entered the Southern Command region, which covers the Caribbean and the northern coast of South America, to monitor narcotrafficking routes linked to Venezuela's military leadership.

The Pentagon said the arrival of USS Gerald R. Ford, carrying more than 4,000 sailors and dozens of tactical aircraft, would "bolster US capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities." It added that the mission aims to "degrade and dismantle transnational criminal organizations."

Within weeks, Venezuelan officers were reportedly training for guerrilla-style defense against a possible U.S. strike — an acknowledgment, according to Reuters, of "rising anxiety inside Caracas."

Into this standoff, Beijing unveiled a "zero-tariff" trade agreement with Caracas at the Shanghai Expo 2025, announced by Deputy Minister for Foreign Trade Coromoto Godoy. Venezuelan officials said the accord covers roughly 400 tariff categories, removing duties on Chinese and Venezuelan goods.

While final implementation details remain pending verification, the goal is clear: Beijing is moving fast into a sanctioned economy that Washington has sought to isolate.

"This really looks like China is going to completely take over the Venezuelan economy," said Gordon Chang, an expert on China's global trade strategy. "It's going to decimate Venezuela's local industry."

"Venezuela basically sells petroleum to China and very little else," he said. "China, of course, is a manufacturer of many, many items. Venezuelan manufacturing is not going to experience a renaissance anytime soon — it's going the opposite direction."

Chang added that Maduro's sudden embrace of Beijing stems from fear of Trump's next move.

"Maduro probably doesn't have a choice," he said. "He realizes he's got a problem in the form of Donald J. Trump. There's a U.S. aircraft carrier not far from his shores, and a lot of military assets bearing down on him. He needs a friend, and he's desperate."

"For Maduro, the zero-tariff pact may offer temporary relief — but it only deepens dependence," Chang added. "I don't see this trade deal as strengthening Venezuela. I see it strengthening China's stranglehold over Venezuela."

US MILITARY BUILDUP IN CARIBBEAN SEES BOMBERS, MARINES AND WARSHIPS CONVERGE NEAR VENEZUELA

From Beijing's perspective, the tariff-free pact opens a commercial and strategic doorway into the Western Hemisphere just as Washington doubles down on sanctions.

The Council on Foreign Relations estimates that China has extended around $60 billion in loans to Venezuela over the past two decades, much of it repaid through oil shipments — a figure still cited by both Chinese and Venezuelan officials in 2025.

"China has leveraged multibillion-dollar loans and the establishment of satellite positioning and surveillance facilities to secure strategic control over Venezuela's natural resources and critical infrastructure," said Isaias Medina III, an Edward Mason Fellow at Harvard University and a former Venezuelan diplomat to the U.N. Security Council.

Medina was referring to the El Sombrero satellite ground station in Venezuela's Guárico province — a joint China-Venezuela project that Western analysts, including a recent Associated Press report, describe as part of a wider space cooperation network giving Beijing an intelligence foothold in Latin America.

Medina said the new pact must be understood as one layer in a wider anti-Western alignment.

"Under the banner of so-called ‘21st Century Socialism,' initiated by Hugo Chávez and expanded by Nicolás Maduro, the nation has evolved into a forward operating base for regimes openly hostile to the United States and its allies," he said.

"Iran, Russia, China, and Cuba have entrenched themselves across Venezuelan territory, using the country as a platform for asymmetric warfare, intelligence operations, and ideological expansion throughout Latin America."

He noted that "Russia's military footprint includes more than $12 billion in arms sales and ongoing defense cooperation and Wagner Group presence in military exercises," while Cuban military advisers remain embedded inside Venezuelan security institutions.

"Iran has exploited this environment to embed terrorist proxies such as Hezbollah and Hamas, using Venezuela as both a financial hub and a logistical corridor. These activities extend to former training camps in Syria, where Venezuelan operatives and mercenaries have been indoctrinated in hybrid warfare tactics," he added. "Iranian interest includes potential drone manufacturing and uranium mining."

"The Maduro government, shielded by the absence of the rule of law or legitimate governance, has replaced statecraft with criminal enterprise," Medina said. "Grand corruption is not the exception; it is the system."

"The humanitarian toll is catastrophic," he added. "Over 30% of Venezuela's population has been forcibly displaced. Starvation has been weaponized as a tool of social control, amounting to a war crime under international law. Despite the enormity of these crimes, many United Nations member states continue to recognize and engage with this illegitimate regime, thereby perpetuating its impunity. The failure to confront this crisis decisively enables a coalition of adversaries, state and non-state actors alike, to project power dangerously close to U.S. territory."

For now, Washington's sanctions campaign still constrains Venezuela's oil lifelines. In March 2025, Reuters reported that U.S. threats to impose tariffs on nations buying Venezuelan crude caused a temporary disruption in shipments to China. Beijing dismissed the measures as "illegal extraterritorial actions" and vowed to continue cooperation — but has not disclosed how it will enforce the new tariff-free pact.

Chang said the underlying reality hasn't changed: China can't protect Caracas from U.S. hard power.

"It can certainly launch a propaganda blitz," he said, "but it can't project military force in the region. It's really up to what President Trump does. China does not have the military strength to oppose American intervention if that's what Trump decides."

Medina agreed that the stakes reach beyond economics. "Just three hours from U.S. shores, this narco-terrorist regime has become the operational convergence of organized crime, drug trafficking, money laundering, and human rights atrocities," he said, urging a Western response combining "diplomatic isolation, targeted sanctions, and, when necessary, defensive deployments."

Energy Secretary Chris Wright discusses renewable energy demands, gas prices and artificial intelligence needs on 'Special Report.'

FIRST ON FOX: An expansive liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in the Arctic took a big step forward this week while officials at the Energy and Interior Departments heralded it as key to President Donald Trump's "American energy dominance" agenda.

Alaska LNG, a branch of the New York City and Anchorage-based Glenfarne energy company, and energy technology giant BakerHughes announced an alliance that will bring to reality and accelerate plans for a nearly 1,000-mile, 42-inch LNG pipeline down the middle of the Last Frontier, and a corresponding terminal on the Kenai peninsula.

The 807-mile pipeline is projected to begin near Prudhoe Bay on the Arctic Ocean and run down to Nikiski – a village halfway between Anchorage and Homer.

Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum announced the agreement, with Glenfarne CEO Brendan Duval saying that BakerHughes' partnership on the project is a big deal due to the company's expertise in LNG compression technology.

Duval said the deal reflects an increased momentum toward the mega-project's future realization and praised the project's ability to attract "global partners [in order] to achieve national and state energy objectives."

"Alaska LNG has the potential to be one of the most significant energy infrastructure projects in our nation's history," Wright said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

"Today's investment announcement is an important step forward for the project, prosperity in Alaska, and the energy security of America and our allies. The Trump administration remains committed to unleashing Alaska's energy potential, including by supporting Alaska LNG."

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum added that U.S. LNG is "not just an energy source [but] a strategic asset that powers our economy."

Burgum, who chairs the National Energy Dominance Council, added that Glenfarne and BakerHughes working together will undoubtedly bear fruit in terms of new energy infrastructure that will create long-term affordable power for Americans that is based in America.

BakerHughes chairman Lorenzo Simonelli said in a statement that natural gas provides secure and reliable energy at an affordable rate to consumers. Simonelli also touted its lower carbon output than other fuels.

According to reports, the project will include a carbon-capture plant on Alaska's remote North Slope that will have the capacity to remove seven million tons of carbon dioxide from the project annually.

Alaska's energy potential has been repeatedly touted by Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who previously told Fox News Digital he is interested in an all-of-the-above approach devoid of politics that instead focuses on what will work and what will keep energy jobs in Alaska and the U.S. writ large versus overseas.

Dunleavy and Alaska officials battled the Biden administration over what they called intentional roadblocks against natural resources exploration in places like Ambler and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's Section 1002; commonly dubbed ANWR.

Outside the Last Frontier's ubiquitous natural gas and oil prowess, Dunleavy previously told Fox News Digital he would also be open to exploring the power-generating potential of tides in Cook Inlet – said to be the second-strongest lunar-powered ebb and flow in the world.

"That basin in Cook Inlet is the most energy-rich basin on the planet: onshore wind, offshore wind, coalfields, oil, gas, tidal, geothermal — all right there," he said, noting a separate wind farm on Anchorage's Fire Island is easily visible from planes taking off at Ted Stevens International Airport.

He said, however, the major issue surrounding any green project is energy-storage capability, pointing to Germany as an example of where that problem has come up.

"You have to have something; a baseline power, which should be gas."

"What people need to know is that Alaska's got this enormous renewable potential that we're going to capitalize on – but you also have to be able to pay for the capital projects in renewables, such as hydro, solar, wind, and the storage — whether that's going to be pumped-hydro up here or some other way to store the energy — but you need to have oil and gas to help pay for that," Dunleavy said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — As the House returns Wednesday for the first time in months, Democrat Adelita Grijalva will be sworn in as its newest member, more than seven weeks after winning a special election in Arizona to fill the seat last held by her late father.

Grijalva's swearing-in is expected to be among the first actions by House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who had previously declined to seat her until the chamber reconvened following a deal to end the government shutdown. The official ceremony is set for 4 p.m. EST, shortly before the House is expected to begin voting. 

For Grijalva, it's the end of a weekslong delay that she and other Democrats said was intended to prevent her signature on a petition to eventually trigger a vote to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein. In an interview with The Associated Press, she said the thought of finally being sworn in was “emotional” and “very much a roller coaster.”

“We've been waiting for this so long that it's still surreal,” she added.

Grijalva's arrival kicks off a busy day on Capitol Hill as hundreds of House members return, their trips potentially complicated by travel delays caused by the shutdown. 

Lawmakers who win special elections typically take the oath of office on days when legislative business is conducted. But with the House out of session since Sept. 19, Johnson had said he would swear her in when everyone returned. He did swear in two Republican members this year when the chamber was not in legislative session. 




“I don't think he's thought of anything that he's doing, in this case, as anything personal,” Grijalva said. “It feels personal because, literally, my name was attached. I also know that if I were a Republican, I would have been sworn in seven weeks ago.”

She will start her House tenure by voting on the Senate-passed legislation to reopen the government. Grijalva and most Democrats are expected to oppose it because it does not extend Affordable Care Act tax credits that expire at the end of the year. Republicans can still pass the bill with their slim majority.

Grijalva would be the final necessary signature on a discharge petition linked to legislation that would require the Justice Department to release all unclassified documents and communications related to Epstein and his sex trafficking operation.

The Epstein Files Transparency Act, co-sponsored by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., is supported by all Democrats and three Republicans, Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Nancy Mace of South Carolina.

Grijalva can add her signature to the petition once she is sworn into office. But her move will not mean a vote right away, due to House rules.

Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern, the top Democrat on the House Rules Committee, said he expects voting on the Epstein bill to take place in early December.

Emails released Wednesday from Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee are likely to reignite interest in the issue. Epstein write in a 2011 email that Donald Trump had “spent hours” at Epstein's house with a victim of sex trafficking and said in a separate message years later that Trump “knew about the girls.”

“The Democrats selectively leaked emails to the liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. 

Leavitt and Republicans on the committee said the person in question was Virginia Giuffre, who accused Epstein of arranging for her to have sexual encounters with a number of his rich and powerful friends. Giuffre, before she died this year, had long insisted that Trump was not among the men who had victimized her.

Rep. Raúl Grijalva, Adelita's father, died in March after more than two decades in the House, where he built a reputation as a staunch progressive.

Adelita Grijalva has long been active in local politics. She served on the Tucson Unified School District board before joining the Pima County Board of Supervisors, where she became only the second woman to lead the board.

She won the Sept. 23 special election with ease to complete the remainder of her father's term, representing a mostly Hispanic district in which Democrats enjoy a nearly 2-to-1 voter registration advantage over Republicans. Grijalva said the win was emotional. 

“I would rather have my dad than have an office,” she said.

She told the AP that environmental justice, tribal sovereignty and public education are among her priorities, echoing the work her father championed.

“I know that the bar is set very high, and the expectation is high of what we're going to be able to do once sworn in,” she said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The sex-offending financier Jeffrey Epstein wrote in a 2019 email to a journalist that Donald Trump “knew about the girls,” according to communications released Wednesday, but the White House quickly accused Democrats of selectively leaking the emails to smear the president.

The emails made public by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee also include one that Epstein wrote in 2011 in which he said Trump had “spent hours” at Epstein's house with a victim of sex trafficking.

The disclosures seemed designed to raise new questions about Trump's friendship with Epstein and about any knowledge he may have had in what prosecutors call a yearslong effort by Epstein to exploit underage girls. The Republican president has consistently denied any knowledge of Epstein's alleged crimes and has said he ended their relationship years ago.

The version of the 2011 email released by the Democrats redacted the name of the victim, but Republicans on the committee later said it was Virginia Giuffre, who accused Epstein of arranging for her to have sexual encounters with a number of his rich and powerful friends.

That's notable because Giuffre, before she died earlier this year, had long insisted that Trump was not among the men who had victimized her.

In a court deposition, she said under oath that she didn't believe Trump had any knowledge of Epstein's misconduct with underage girls. And in her recently released memoir, she described meeting Trump only once, when she worked as a spa attendant at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.




Giuffre described being introduced to Trump by her father, who also worked at the club. She described Trump as friendly and said he offered to help her get babysitting jobs with parents at the club. Other members of Epstein's household staff also said in sworn depositions that, while Trump did stop by Epstein's house, they didn't see him engage in any inappropriate conduct.

White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt accused the Democrats of having “selectively leaked emails” to “create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.”

The messages are part of a batch of 23,000 documents provided by Epstein's estate to the Oversight Committee. The release resurfaces a storyline that had shadowed Trump's presidency during the summer when the FBI and the Justice Department abruptly announced that they would not be releasing additional documents that investigators had spent weeks examining, disappointing conspiracy theorists and online sleuths who had expected to see new revelations.




In one 2019 email to journalist Michael Wolff, who has written extensively about Trump, Epstein wrote of Trump, “Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”

In an April 2, 2011, email to Ghislaine Maxwell, an Epstein girlfriend now imprisoned for conspiring to engage in sex trafficking, Epstein wrote, “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump. (Redacted name) spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.”

Maxwell replied the same day: “I have been thinking about that.”

The name of the person said to have spent time with Trump was blacked out of the email, but House Democrats identified the person as a “victim.”

Leavitt said that the unnamed person referenced in the emails is Giuffre, who had accused Britain's then-Prince Andrew and other influential men of sexually exploiting her as a teenager and who died by suicide in April. Andrew, who recently was stripped of his titles and evicted from his royal residence by King Charles III after weeks of pressure to act over his relationship with Epstein, has rejected Giuffre's allegations and said he didn't recall meeting her.

Leavitt said in a statement that Giuffre had “repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and ‘couldn't have been friendlier' to her in their limited interactions.”

“The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,” the statement said. “These stories are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to distract from President Trump's historic accomplishments, and any American with common sense sees right through this hoax and clear distraction from the government opening back up again.”

Giuffre came forward publicly after an initial investigation ended in an 18-month Florida jail term for Epstein, who made a secret deal to avoid federal prosecution by pleading guilty instead to relatively minor state-level charges of soliciting prostitution. He was released in 2009.

In subsequent lawsuits, Giuffre said she was a teenage spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago when she was approached in 2000 by Maxwell.

Lawyers for Maxwell, a British socialite, have argued that she never should have been tried or convicted for her role in luring teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. She is serving a 20-year prison term, though she was moved from a low-security federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas after she was interviewed in July by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.

Epstein took his own life in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal charges.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Approval of the way President Donald Trump is managing the government has dropped sharply since early in his second term, according to a new AP-NORC poll, with much of the rising discontent coming from fellow Republicans.

The survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research was conducted after Democrats' recent victories in off-year elections but before Congress took major steps to try to end the longest shutdown in U.S. history. It shows that only 33% of U.S. adults approve of the way the Republican president is managing the government, down from 43% in an AP-NORC poll from March.

That was driven in large part by a decline in approval among Republicans and independents. According to the survey, only about two-thirds of Republicans, 68%, said they approve of Trump's government management, down from 81% in March. Independents' approval dropped from 38% to 25%.




The results highlight the risks posed by the shutdown, which Trump and his administration have tried to pin squarely on Democrats, even as U.S. adults have cast blame on both parties as the funding lapse has snarled air traffic, left hundreds of thousands of federal workers without paychecks and comprised food aid for some of the most vulnerable Americans. But it could also indicate broader discontent with Trump's other dramatic — and polarizing — changes to the federal government in recent months, including gutting agencies and directing waves of mass layoffs.




Republicans have generally been steadfast in their support for the president, making their growing displeasure particularly notable.

“I'm thoroughly disturbed by the government shutdown for 40-something days,” said Beverly Lucas, 78, a Republican and retired educator who lives in Ormond Beach, Florida, and compared Trump's second term to “having a petulant child in the White House, with unmitigated power.”

“When people are hungry, he had a party,” she said, referring to a Great Gatsby-themed Halloween party held at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. “I thought he seems callous.”

The survey found an overwhelming majority of Democrats, 95%, continue to disapprove of Trump's management of the federal government, compared with 89% in March.

Even with the decline in support for his management of the government, Trump's overall approval rating has remained steady in the new poll. About one-third of U.S. adults, 36%, approve of his overall handling of the presidency, roughly in line with 37% in an October AP-NORC poll. Approval of his handling of key issues like immigration and the economy have also barely changed since last month.




Health care emerged as a key issue in the shutdown debate as Democrats demanded that Republicans negotiate with them to extend tax credits that expire Jan. 1. But Trump's approval on the issue, which was already fairly low, has barely changed.

About one-third, 34%, of Americans said they approved of Trump's handling of health care in the November poll, compared with 31% in October. 

And many of his supporters are still behind him. Susan McDuffie, 74, a Republican who lives in Carson City, Nevada, and retired several years ago, said she has “great confidence in Trump” and thinks the country is on the right track. She blames Democrats for the shutdown and the suffering it's caused.

“I just don't understand how the Democrats can care so little about the people,” she said, scoffing at the idea that Democrats were trying to use the shutdown to force Republicans to address soon-to-skyrocket health care costs.

“I don't have any patience for the Democrats and their lame excuses,” she said, arguing that people who are scared about SNAP benefits expiring and struggling to put food on the table are a more pressing issue. 

When it comes to the shutdown, there is still plenty of blame to go around. Recent polls have indicated that while Republicans may be taking slightly more heat, many think Democrats are at fault, too.

“I truly do believe it's everybody. Everybody is being stubborn,” said Nora Bailey, 33, a moderate who lives in the Batesville area in Arkansas and does not align with either party.

After recently giving birth, she said, she faced delays in getting a breast pump through a government program that helps new mothers while her son was in intensive care. And she is worried about her disabled parents, who rely on SNAP food stamp benefits.

Overall, she said she is mixed on Trump's handling of the job and disapproves of his management of the federal government because she believes he has not gone far enough to tackle waste.

“I don't see enough being done yet to tell me we have downsized the federal government instead of having all these excess people,” she said.

It's possible that Trump's approval on handling the federal government will rebound if the government reopens. But the showdown could have a more lasting impact on perceptions of the president, whose approval on the economy and immigration has eroded slightly since the spring.

Lucas, the Florida Republican, said shutdowns in which civilians aren't paid are the wrong way to address ideological disagreement.

“Air traffic controllers? Really? You want to not pay the people in whose hands your lives are every day?” she said. “We need to be addressing these conflicts like intelligent people and not thugs and bullies on the playground.”

Kai Trump, the granddaughter of President Donald Trump, explains how her love for golf, which she will be playing at the University of Miami in 2026, was influenced by her grandfather.

President Donald Trump's granddaughter, Kai, is at Pelican Golf Club in Belleair, Florida, to make her LPGA debut this week.

The 18-year-old received a sponsorship exemption for The ANNIKA, given to emerging golfers to showcase their talents.

Ahead of her big weekend, Trump said she got advice from none other than Grandpa himself, who kept it short and sweet.

"Go out there and have fun. Just don't get nervous," she said.

Tiger Woods, who is currently dating Trump's mother, Vanessa — Don Jr.'s ex-wife —, also gave Trump advice.

"I mean, he is the best golfer in the entire world. I would say that. And even better person," she said. "He told me to go out there and have fun and just go with the flow. Whatever happens, happens."

Trump played a practice round with Annika Sorenstam, the host of the tournament that bears her name, and the LPGA legend gave the youngster nothing but praise.

"I was talking to her about my tendencies and said, ‘What are your tendencies?' And she went off, ‘this is what I do, and I'm trying to do that.' She's really interested in just getting better and learning about her swing…" she said, via the Golf Channel. "Just the excitement of learning and getting better, I thought that was pretty cool. I was trying to remember if I was 18, and I would play with somebody, if I would dare to ask a question. I probably would've been super quiet."

"Going out there and playing a big course and environment like this, I'm sure she's used to a lot of people looking at her and analyzing everything," Sorenstam added. "One thing that's different this year is I've never seen so many Secret Service people around here; I feel super safe, that's another thing. ... I just don't know how she does it honestly. To be 18 years old and hear all the comments, she must be super tough on the inside. I'm sure we can all relate what it's like to get criticism here and there, but she gets it a thousand times. So, that's why I just want to give her a break, come out here and have fun. We want her to feel like family here, and I want her to feel welcome.

"I mean, give this girl a chance, right?"

Nelly Korda is the reigning champ of The ANNIKA, also winning the event in 2021 and 2022.

Trump has gained a following on social media, mostly through YouTube, and recently posted a video of herself playing with her grandfather at Trump National Golf Club, Washington, D.C., and the two of them attending the Ryder Cup.

"I just don't view it as him being the president. I view it as, he's my grandpa. We're gonna go out there and play golf," Kai said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital. "We play golf all the time. It's nothing new."

In that interview, Trump reiterated her goal of going pro.

CHICAGO (AP) — The cyclists arrive at sunrise, rolling through Chicago's Latino neighborhoods and stopping at tamale carts, elote stands and candy stalls. They buy out every last item — every tamale, every corn cob, every bundle of sweets. Then they load up the food and deliver it to shelters and families in need.

Since the start of a federal immigration crackdown that has led to more than 3,200 arrests in the Chicago metropolitan area, streets and storefronts in the city's Latino neighborhoods have emptied out. Street vendors, fearing arrest, have been afraid to leave their homes to work. Local restaurants have struggled as customers stay home.

But as fear spread, so did something else — neighbors stepping up for one another and finding creative ways to show up for vendors and restaurant owners. This includes a grassroots effort to organize so-called “buy out” events meant to allow vendors who fear being detained by immigration agents to go home early. Some Chicagoans have pooled money in their neighborhoods or through local organizations while others have simply bought out taco stands while on their way to work or tamale vendors outside their local bars.

In Little Village, Rick Rosales, community organizer with Cycling x Solidarity, helps organize two of these “buy out” rides per week that typically support five street vendors each.

“The vendors are often speechless,” Rosales said. “They'll say, ‘I have a lot of tamales. You want all of them?'”

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Once, after the group bought out a tamale vendor's cart, that man found them days later to say immigration agents were spotted on his block just hours after. “You saved my life,” Rosales said the man told them.

“This is about food and joy and bike rides,” Rosales said. “But it's also so incredibly high stakes because of the fear in our communities right now.”

It's hard to say how many street vendors have been targeted by federal immigration agents, said Maria Orozco, outreach organizer for the Street Vendors Association of Chicago, adding she knows of at least 10 who have been detained.

In September, a tamale vendor was detained while selling outside a Home Depot, according to local advocates. Soon after, federal agents arrested a flower seller in the southwest neighborhood of Archer Heights. Then they came for a cotton candy vendor in the predominantly Mexican American Little Village. Immigration agents descended on the Swap-O-Rama flea market in October and detained more than a dozen people. And last week, over 100 residents in the Brighton Park neighborhood rallied to demand the release of their local tamalero.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Orozco said losing these vendors is as much a cultural loss as an economic one, calling them part of the “fabric of our city.” She said they bring life, color and flavor to the city's streets, preserving culinary traditions and building a sense of community — and they are beloved by neighbors.

Street vendors who are afraid to work or are seeing drops in sales can apply to get financial support through the Street Vendors Association of Chicago. The group launched a GoFundMe with the goal of raising $300,000 to support street vendors.

Orozco said local businesses have also hosted pop-up events where a certain percentage of proceeds go to street vendors. The organization has also helped connect vendors to people hoping to “buy them out,” Orozco said.

“It's been emotional to see,” she said. “The vendors themselves didn't realize how much Chicagoans love and support them. None of us expected this.”

As Alonso Zaragoza, executive administrator of his neighborhood advocacy group, drove through his predominantly Latino community of Belmont Cragin, he noticed restaurants were mostly empty and dark. Restaurants in majority-Latino communities have reported significant drops in sales since federal agents descended on the city in September.

So Zaragoza began organizing restaurant crawls, drawing hundreds to struggling Latino-owned eateries. His previous event began at a taco and tamales restaurant and ended with a Mexican ice cream shop. Along the way, street cart vendors hawked elote, cotton candy and balloons as a local musical group played folk and bluegrass music.

“The financial support for our businesses is needed more than ever now,” Zaragoza said. “It goes such a long way.”

Delilah Martinez, a community organizer and owner of the Vault Gallerie in Pilsen, couldn't stand the silence on her street anymore. She was used to seeing familiar faces on 18th Street — a woman selling candy with her baby strapped to her back, a paletero who smiled at her each afternoon. Then one week, they were gone.

“It broke my heart,” Martinez said. “The streets felt empty. Our people were putting their freedom at risk just to work.”

She began raising money online and started “Operation Buyout,” approaching vendors one by one to purchase everything they had. The first woman was shocked when Martinez handed her $500.

“I just wanted her to have a day of rest, a day without fear,” Martinez said.

Among those Martinez helped recently was a baker from Mexico City who arrived in Chicago 24 years ago.

Each night, he works late, hands dusted with flour, kneading dough until they're sore and aching. For those few quiet hours, after his four children are asleep, the world feels simpler.

“There is a magic when I'm baking,” he said in Spanish. “I feel free. When I'm angry, I feel like the bread will absorb it. So I try to be happy and at peace, even when I know the reality is different.”

By 3 a.m., he's up again for his grocery store shift, juggling work and school drop-offs. For years, he's sold birthday cakes and pan dulce “by word of mouth” from his small kitchen, dreaming of one day opening his own shop.

But the baker has also heard the stories: street vendors arrested on residential streets and federal agents circling his historically Mexican American neighborhood of Pilsen. Two of his friends have been detained. When he hears sirens and helicopters, he feels “sick with fear.”

“I'm afraid for my youngest daughter,” he said. “It would be horrible to leave her. … I can't see myself without my children.”

Martinez led the baker to a table and pulled off a black cloth. A silver, restaurant-grade mixer gleamed under the fluorescent light. Martinez also handed him an envelope with $1,500 gathered from neighbors hoping to help support him when he feels unsafe selling his baked goods on the street.

The man's hand flew up to cover his mouth. He kicked his legs and began to cry.

“Thank you so much,” he said, clutching a mixer attachment to his chest. “It's beautiful.”

Fox News host Jimmy Failla and guests highlight former first lady Michelle Obama's new podcast and discuss rumors surrounding her and former President Barack Obama on 'Fox News Saturday Night.'

Former first lady Michelle Obama revealed on a recent episode of her podcast that she was left infuriated by a moment on Air Force One in 2009 when she debated whether to wear Bermuda shorts while on vacation — which ultimately led to controversy. 

"The fact that we had to spend time thinking about that kind of stuff in ways that my husband didn't — it was really infuriating," Obama said during an episode on her podcast, "IMO With Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson," which she co-hosts with her brother. "Then an article, a negative article, still happened." 

The former first lady explained that in August 2009 she and the former president were set to depart Air Force One for a hike in the Grand Canyon while on their first vacation since the inauguration earlier that year. While she fretted over what attire would be appropriate for a first lady and not draw public criticism, Barack Obama did not need to put effort into thinking about his outfit, she recounted. 

"It was 100 degrees," Michelle Obama remembered of the conversation. "Barack — I was like, 'Well, what are you wearing?' He was like, 'Well, I'm gonna throw on some sneakers, I'm gonna take my jacket off and roll my sleeves up' because that's what men can do. White shirt, no collar, no tie. That was how he changed."

Michelle Obama said she debated whether to wear hiking shorts or a dress before landing on wearing Bermuda shorts. 

"I can't wear hiking shorts there, and I can't wear a dress to hike," she said. "That would be crazy. People would call me 'disconnected' and 'un-American.' I'm at the Grand Canyon in a tea-length dress with flats? I was like, 'That's not how people go to the Grand Canyon.'"

"I eventually opted for the thing that felt mostly me," Michelle Obama continued. "And it was the Bermuda shorts. Because if we're going on a hike, this is how a normal person would go on a hike."

The former first lady did face backlash for the attire, as pundits at the time criticized that a first lady wearing shorts while departing Air Force One was too casual, with outlets running headlines such as, "Who Wears Short Shorts? Michelle Obama," "First lady's shorts draw some long, hard looks," and "Michelle Obama: The Shorts Heard Round the World."

Michelle Obama said in 2013 that she would not wear shorts again on Air Force One after the 2009 outfit caused "a huge stink." She explained at the time that she made the more relaxed choice because "we're on vacation."

First lady Melania Trump also has faced backlash over her wardrobe attire, including in 2017 when she wore a baseball cap and jeans to visit Texas after Hurricane Harvey that was viewed by some critics as too casual, and again in 2018 when she wore a green jacket while on a trip to visit the border that read, "I really don't care. Do u?"

Melania Trump later told the media she wore the jacket as a message to the liberal media and other critics: "I want to show them that I don't care," she told ABC News in 2018.

DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin joins Saturday in America to discuss the economic impact of the government shutdown on TSA workers as they continue to work without pay and growing anti-ICE protests around the country.

A transgender Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officer in Virginia is suing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), accusing it of sex discrimination over a new policy that bars transgender agents from conducting security screening pat-downs, according to a federal lawsuit.

Danielle Mittereder, a transgender woman and TSA officer at Dulles International Airport, filed the lawsuit Friday claiming the new policy violates civil rights law, according to The Associated Press.

A TSA spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the new policy states that only male officers can perform pat-downs on male passengers and only female officers can perform pat-downs on female passengers.

MINNESOTA GIRLS SOFTBALL PLAYERS REACT AFTER JUDGE THROWS OUT THEIR LAWSUIT OVER TRANSGENDER PITCHER

The rule applies regardless of an officer's gender identity or transition status.

The spokesperson said that the rule change was implemented to comply with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump on Jan. 20. That order, titled "Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government," declared that the federal government will recognize only two sexes — male and female — defined by biological sex "at conception."

Until February, TSA assigned work consistent with officers' gender identity under a 2021 management directive, the agency said. 

"Male Transportation Security Officers will conduct pat-down procedures on male passengers and female Transportation Security Officers will conduct pat-down procedures on female passengers, based on operational needs," the statement reads.

According to internal documents obtained by the AP, transgender officers will also no longer serve as a TSA-required witness when a traveler elects to have a pat-down conducted in a private screening area.

Mittereder claims in the lawsuit that transgender officers are also barred from using restrooms that align with their gender identity, arguing the restrictions block promotions, specialized certifications and core job duties.

"Solely because she is transgender, TSA now prohibits plaintiff from conducting core functions of her job, impedes her advancement to higher-level positions and specialized certifications, excludes her from TSA-controlled facilities and subjects her identity to unwanted and undue scrutiny each workday," the complaint reads, according to the AP.

Mittereder's attorney, Jonathan Puth, called TSA's policy "terribly demeaning and 100% illegal," according to the AP.

DHS pushed back on assertions by some legal experts that the policy is discriminatory.

"Does the AP want female travelers to be subjected to pat-downs by male TSA officers?" Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a written response to the outlet. 

"What a useless and fundamentally dangerous idea, to prioritize mental delusion over the comfort and safety of American travelers," McLaughlin added.

Fox News Digital also reached out to DHS for comment.

NEW YORK (AP) — Visa and Mastercard have proposed a settlement in their long-running legal dispute with merchants and retailers over how much they charge merchants to accept their cards.

The most important part of the settlement could directly impact how customers use their Visa- and Mastercard-issued credit cards, and may result in some consumers getting denied at the point-of-sale for purchases

Visa and Mastercard have been in litigation with a class-action group of merchants for nearly 20 years over the costs they impose on merchants to use their payment networks, known as interchange. A previous settlement was rejected by the judge overseeing the case last this year, requiring Visa and Mastercard's lawyers to go back to the drawing board on the scope and size of the settlement.

The new part of the settlement announced Monday addresses the “honor all cards” rule, a cornerstone of how credit and debit cards work in the U.S.

The “honor all cards” rule states that if a merchant accepts Visa or Mastercard as a form of payment, they are required to accept all iterations of Visa and Mastercard products, regardless of who issues it and the cost to the merchant.

That has led to consternation among merchants over the years because rewards-heavy credit cards, like the Chase Sapphire Reserve or Citi Strata Elite, use a premium version of a Visa or Mastercard. For the Sapphire Reserve, Chase uses the Visa Infinite card, and for a card like Strata Elite, it's issued as a World Elite Mastercard. These cards have gotten far more popular in the last decade.




Both a Visa Infinite and World Elite Mastercard cost more for a merchant to accept. The amount of additional interchange a merchant will pay varies on size and industry, but one example is the Visa Infinite, which can be 15 basis points (0.15%) more expensive than a Visa Signature (a mid-tier credit card) for a merchant to accept.

Under the proposed settlement, merchants could discriminate between the different tiers of Visa and Mastercard products, meaning high-reward credit card users may be declined at checkout if the merchant has opted out of accepting the higher-tier card. A merchant may also be able to pass along the higher cost to accept the rewards cards to the customer in the form of a surcharge on their bill, under the proposed settlement.

This will place merchants in the position of making a choice: accept all cards with the higher fees or reject some of the higher-fee cards and likely upset wealthier consumers who typically enjoy earning points on routine purchases.

Like the previous settlement last year, merchants would receive a temporary reduction on swipe fees for a few years. In this settlement it would be a 10 basis point reduction in swipe fees for five years, and standard credit card transactions would be processed at 1.25% of the purchase price for eight years.

When the settlement was announced on Monday, the major merchant and retail lobby groups came out in opposition, so it's not certain whether this settlement will ultimately be the one that is finalized. Merchants and lobbyists have been pushing for years to get Congress to regulate interchange fees, as they do with debit cards. The merchant groups say this settlement does not go far enough. 

“Once again, this proposal is all window dressing and no substance. The reduction in swipe fees doesn't begin to go far enough, and the change in the honor-all-cards rule would accomplish nothing. If the courts can't fix this, it's time for Congress to take action,” said Stephanie Martz, chief administrative officer and general counsel for the National Retail Federation, in a statement.

The payment networks, who are ready to put the matter behind them after two decades of litigation, say this may be the best solution for the merchants to potentially avoid a drawn out trial-and-appeal process.

“We believe that this is the best resolution for all parties, delivering the clarity, flexibility and consumer protections that were sought in this effort,” a Mastercard company spokesperson said.

The settlement involves Visa and Mastercard only. American Express, which uses a closed-loop system where it's both the issuing bank and payment network for their cards, is not involved in this ongoing litigation. The settlement also does not impact debit cards.

California has revoked 17,000 nondomiciled commercial driver's licenses issued illegally in the state after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy demanded it do so.

The Transportation Department and the state of California have disagreed over the Golden State's compliance with federal trucking laws for several months. Duffy continues to reprimand the state for its noncompliance, and California officials have repeatedly argued they are following all regulations.

In a Wednesday announcement, the Transportation Department said the California Department of Motor Vehicles had issued 17,000 nondomiciled CDLs in violation of federal regulations. Duffy has made cracking down on non-English speaking commercial truck drivers a cornerstone priority of his department. His efforts heightened after a fatal semitruck crash in the summer caused by a non-English proficient illegal immigrant, who had one of his licenses issued in California.

“After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed,” Duffy said in a statement. “Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked.”

Duffy reiterated his threat to pull $160 million in federal funding from the state if it does not revoke all CDLs issued in violation of federal standards.

“This is just the tip of the iceberg,” Duffy said. “My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.”

The California Department of Motor Vehicles did not respond to the Washington Examiner‘s requests for comment.

In late October, the state's DMV told the Washington Examiner that the Transportation Department previously allowed CDLs “for asylum seekers and refugees.”

In a September letter obtained by the Washington Examiner, Alicia Fowler, the general counsel for the California State Transportation Agency, argued that the state is in full compliance with federal laws.

“California's laws, regulations, standards, and orders are either identical to or have the same effect as the federal safety requirements—including the English language proficiency requirement,” Fowler wrote.

However, a Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration audit this year revealed that 25% of nondomiciled CDLs were issued out of compliance with federal regulations. The audit found “systemic non-compliance” in California, Colorado, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, and Washington.

A spokesperson for the Transportation Department said it “urges all states to revoke illegally issued CDLs,” and that California was the first state found to be out of compliance.

California is also one of the top CDL-issuing states in the nation, according to the department.

DOT, CALIFORNIA DISAGREE ON STATE'S COMPLIANCE WITH ENGLISH REQUIREMENTS FOR TRUCKERS. HERE'S WHAT TO KNOW

“Sounds like the federal Secretary of Transportation needs a lesson on his own road rules,” Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D-CA) press office wrote in an X post. “The facts are plain and simple — California commercial driver's license holders had a fatal crash rate nearly 40% LOWER than the national average.”

The Transportation Department said it has notified the 17,000 nondomiciled CDL holders that their licenses are out of compliance with federal requirements. These licenses will expire in 60 days, according to the department.

Andrew Gwaivangmin, the executive secretary of the Nigeria Evangelical Missions Association, says Christians are "excited" that President Donald Trump is prioritizing efforts to stop violence against believers after years of bloodshed.

A Nigerian mission leader said President Donald Trump's push to end the violence against Christians in his country is an "answered prayer."

Andrew Gwaivangmin, the executive secretary of the Nigeria Evangelical Missions Association, told Fox News in an interview that Christians are "excited" Trump is prioritizing efforts to stop the killings of believers after years of bloodshed.

"We have cried out to the international community to force our government to do the right thing. This is the only time that America is focusing its attention on this violence in Nigeria. So, as a Christian, I'm excited," he said.

"I'm happy that Trump is focusing on ensuring that this violence stops. Anybody who doesn't support the intervention by Trump, clearly, you know that the person doesn't understand the reality and the gravity of the violence that have occurred in the north of Nigeria over the last 10 years."

RAP STAR NICKI MINAJ THANKS TRUMP FOR ADDRESSING PERSECUTION OF CHRISTIANS IN NIGERIA

Trump threatened in a November Truth Social post to send U.S. troops "guns-a-blazing" into the most populous country in Africa to "completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities." The president also threatened to stop all aid and assistance if the violence continued.

Nigerian President Bola Tinubu responded to Trump's threat, writing on social media that his administration has worked with Christian and Muslim leaders to address security challenges affecting citizens across all faiths and regions.

"The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians," he wrote on X.

"Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so. Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it."

Open Doors, an international Christian organization that supports persecuted believers, said attacks are most common in the northern, Muslim-majority states of Nigeria but have started spreading into the Middle Belt and farther south.

The organization stated that Christians are at risk from targeted attacks by Islamist militants, including Fulani fighters and Boko Haram. Women are often killed and subjected to sexual violence.

Gwaivangmin told Fox News that many of his organization's missionaries have been attacked and killed.

"We've had casualties. We've had to bury our missionaries. Our missionaries have to directly relocate. In fact, I can tell you that today, we have hundreds of widows whose husbands have been killed in their field as missionaries," he said.

"It's not easy to be a Christian in Nigeria, and sadly, our government doesn't seem to care to hold people accountable for all the killings, the mass killings that occur in this country," Gwaivangmin added.

The leader of the largest global missions organization for the Nigerian Christian church said he would welcome U.S. military involvement to help end the violence. He believes having American boots on the ground isn't realistic, but hopes the United States can provide logistical support and equipment to strengthen Nigeria's forces.

NEW YORK (AP) — In the decade following her debut album, Meghan Trainor has lived myriad lives — but the message of her bright, cheery pop music has remained the same: Stay true to who you are and ignore the haters. That spirit endures on her lead single, the jovial “Still Don't Care,” the first tease of her forthcoming seventh full-length album, “Toy with Me,” out April 24.

And in true Trainor fashion, “Still Don't Care” was inspired by real life situations. “I was seeing a lot of hate all over the world, but I was getting a lot of hate when I started posting more pictures of ... my fitness journey and my health journey. And I didn't really expect that,” Trainor told The Associated Press. “I would get really upset at comments and I was like, ‘I wish I didn't feel like this. I wish I didn't give them so much power.'

“And so, when I write songs, I always write in the perspective of how I wish I thought, like ‘All About That Bass.' I didn't feel like that when I wrote it,” she continued. “And all my self-love anthems. But when I perform them and I see how it affects other people, I start believing them.”

“Still Don't Care” is yet another example, with its maximalist, ‘80s pop production and choir courtesy of Pentatonix's Scott Hoying. Her mom, brother and sister-in-law contribute background vocals on it as well — perhaps softening the song's gloves-up approach to combating online hate. “You could tear me apart,” Trainor sings. “But I sleep well at night.”




It's the first taste of “Toy with Me,” which Trainor teases will have a few self-love bops, songs to excise her anger through and lots of familial love. “The only features I have right now in this moment are my kids, Riley and Barry, because I wrote them a beautiful song, the only, like, slower song. It's called ‘Little One' and it's about how I wish they could stay little forever,” she said, smiling. “When I play it, Riley goes, ‘Oh, this is my song. Play my song!' It's literally my lullaby for them. And at the end of the song they say, ‘I love you, Mama,' and it's just the cutest thing ever. And that's when everyone's crying.”

Trainor said she worked on the album for eight months. “I exhausted myself, and I went a little too hard. I got excited to be home with the kids and work on my songs, but then I definitely, I overdid it, and my body started doing weird things, giving me signals. Like, my tongue started burning one day. And I was like, ‘What's this?' And it wouldn't go away forever. And the dentist was like, ‘Oh, you're stressed,'” she recalled.

Songwriting, too, was a challenge. “I usually write a song in one day and I'm done with it, but each song on this album took, like, months to finish,” she said. “So that was the only difference from this album than any other album I've done.”

A lot of that was because she enlisted songwriters she's never worked with before — people who would push her to make the song the best it could be — challenges she welcomed with open arms. 

The work is fulfilling, and so she continues: Trainor will also embark on a North American tour in 2026 with openers Icona Pop. The Get in Girl tour kicks off June 12 at the Pine Knob Music Theatre in Clarkston, Michigan, and ends Aug. 15 at Los Angeles' Kia Forum.

Along the way, she'll hit Toronto, Cincinnati, St. Louis, New York, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Cleveland, Houston, Denver, Salt Lake City, Seattle, San Francisco, San Diego, Phoenix and many more.

Trainor's last tour, the Timeless Tour, marked her first in seven years. It proved to Trainor that she can do this thing again. “I'm not absolutely petrified like I was for the Timeless Tour,” she said. “I know I can survive it and it can be really fun.”

After an American Express pre-sale, tickets will become available to the general public on Nov. 21, at 10 a.m. local time.

America Reports' panelists analyze the public fallout over the shutdown deal in the Democratic Party.

FIRST ON FOX: House GOP leaders are looking to kick off next week in high gear to make up for the six weeks they spent out of session during the government shutdown.

With the end of Congress' 42-day fiscal standoff in sight, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told Fox News Digital that House lawmakers will be faced with an accelerated schedule to accomplish the GOP's priorities for this term.

"I wanted to rework the schedule to create more time to make up for what happened during the shutdown, and the fact that there were a lot of bills that stacked up that we planned to bring to the floor in October that weren't able to go," he said in an interview on Tuesday night.

Priorities for next week include legislation to help reduce federal restrictions on liquefied natural gas (LNG), and a bill aimed at expanding refining capacity in a bid to reduce soaring energy costs.

Measures aimed at D.C. are also expected to see votes, including a bill that D.C.'s pretrial release and detention processes require mandatory pretrial detention for defendants charged with violent crimes. 

Another bill expected to get a vote next week would undo local ordinances that Republicans say place burdensome barriers on the Metropolitan Police Department.

A largely symbolic measure to denounce socialism in the U.S. is also on next week's schedule.

Lawmakers will be expected to work long into the night in a departure from their traditional day-to-day in D.C. Votes will be scheduled in the evenings when lawmakers have normally departed Capitol Hill for other events.

Scalise also noted the House would have a five-day legislative week from Monday through Friday, rather than the more traditional four days in D.C.

More time will also be allotted during the day for House committees to conduct hearings and advance their legislation, something that has not been done on Capitol Hill since Sept. 19.

"We're going to do that for the next few weeks until we catch up on the time that we missed when everybody was back in their districts," Scalise said.

The latter point is critical considering Congress will be reckoning with several key priorities in the coming months.

The bill to end the government shutdown, expected to pass the House on Wednesday, kicks the majority of fiscal year (FY) 2026 federal spending to a Jan. 30 deadline. It would also authorize funding for three of Congress' 12 annual spending bills for FY 2026.

However, it will be an uphill battle for both the Senate and House appropriations committees to strike their remaining spending deals by then.

"There are nine remaining bills, and we'd like to get all of those done in the next few weeks. And so, [House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla.] and his appropriators will be working overtime as well," Scalise said.

Congress also still has to find a bipartisan compromise on the federal government's annual defense policy bill, called the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).

"There have been a lot of negotiations ongoing. I think we're getting close on the NDAA," Scalise said.

Scalise said Republicans would also be busy at work on a new Farm Bill, legislation that sets agricultural priorities as well as federal food policies for urban, suburban and rural areas across the country, as well as a highway bill — legislation that authorizes policy for surface infrastructure like roads, bridges and rail lines nationwide.

"A lot of those bills have been very active in the committee process. They just haven't gotten a lot of attention nationally during the shutdown. But the committees have been working, especially the chairman, to try to get those bills ready to move," he said.

"And so we will have a lot of big ticket items that are important to our America First agenda ready to go. And that's why we're going to just add more floor time to be able to get all of it done by the end of this year."

But in order to get all those "big-ticket items" done, the House will first need to pass the Senate's bipartisan bill to end the government shutdown.

Asked if his chamber had the votes to do so, Scalise said, "I'm very hopeful we will."

"I'm very confident our members are really eager to get back to a full House schedule. Many of them have been working overtime in their districts to mop up the mess Democrats created during the shutdown," he said.

Fox News correspondent Brooke Taylor details the Louisiana manhunt for a bank robber who allegedly faked a limp in a broad daylight heist on ‘America Reports.'

A man who limped into a Louisiana bank with a cane and sprinted out seconds later with cash in hand is wanted by police.

Surveillance video from a Fidelity Bank branch in Slidell, just outside New Orleans, captured the bizarre ruse.

In the video, the man hobbles through the doors wearing a neck brace and clutching a short cane before sliding a note to the teller.

Moments later, he stuffs a stack of cash into his fanny pack, then suddenly ditches the limp and bolts out the door.

The robbery happened shortly before 4 p.m. Friday, Nov. 7, police said. According to the Slidell Police Department, the suspect demanded money while shouting that it was a robbery before fleeing on foot, this time without any sign of injury.

"The suspect entered the bank appearing to be handicapped, walking with a fake limp, a cane, and a neck brace," police said in a Facebook post. "He then fled the scene, without a limp, with an undisclosed amount of cash."

A spokesperson for the Slidell Police Department told Fox News Digital the man's appearance immediately raised suspicions among bank employees.

"He walked in as a red flag, just out of pure appearance," the spokesperson said. "Everything he was dressed in, from the hat to the neck brace, to the cane, to the multiple layers of clothing, to the face mask. As an employee of a financial institution, somebody comes in where you can barely make out their identity — that's a red flag."

Before staff could process what was happening, the robbery was underway.

"They were taken back, they were shook up. Thankfully, it went the way it did, he didn't cause any harm to anybody," the spokesperson said.

Police said the suspect sat inside for several minutes, waiting for customers to leave before making his move.

"He went in there and sat around for a couple of minutes because there were other patrons of the bank present," the spokesperson said. "Once he was alone with the tellers, he slid a note. The victim didn't even get a chance to read it before he started screaming, ‘This is a robbery!' — just like something you'd see in a movie."

The suspect grabbed the money, snatched back the note and ran.

The spokesperson said that while bank robberies are increasingly rare, this one stood out because of the suspect's elaborate deception.

"We've dealt with bank robberies since the beginning of time," the spokesperson said. "It's not too common anymore just because of technology, but every now and then you get some bold person who thinks they can pull off a heist. The pure elaborate game plan that he went in there with — acting like he was crippled, going to that extent, and then just taking the money and running away, literally no injury — was something else."

The video ends with the man sprinting through the parking lot, disappearing from sight and the limp completely gone.

Officers and K-9 units searched nearby neighborhoods, but investigators believe the man may have escaped the area in a vehicle.

The suspect is described as a Black male wearing a gray tracksuit, bucket hat, neck brace, clear fanny pack and a face mask.

Police are urging anyone who recognizes the man, or who may have captured him on home security cameras along Choctaw Drive, to contact the Slidell Police Department at 985-643-3131.

Officials said the suspect remains on the loose as investigators analyze new leads.

"We're fishing through all the evidence," the spokesperson said, "but I've been told we've finally got our hands on something potentially promising."

A federal judge is poised to hear arguments this week in a joint motion by former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James seeking to disqualify interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan from overseeing their criminal prosecutions in the Eastern District of Virginia. 

U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton sitting by designation from South Carolina to avoid conflicts in the district, will preside over the hearing Thursday morning. Currie has already ordered full grand jury transcripts for review, signaling an unusual level of scrutiny of what Halligan's role was before the indictments were handed up to her by grand jurors.

If the court takes the unusual step of removing Halligan, the question arises whether the indictments she obtained must also be dismissed or whether a replacement prosecutor would simply assume the case.

In respective filings unsealed Monday, Comey and James argue that Halligan's appointment was invalid and that her involvement taints the integrity of both prosecutions. They note that Halligan had never worked as a prosecutor before being appointed to lead the Eastern District of Virginia and that her predecessor, Erik Siebert, resigned under pressure after declining to pursue these same cases. Within days of being sworn in, Halligan secured a grand jury indictment against Comey, followed by an indictment against James weeks later.

Comey's lawyers argue that those circumstances demonstrate improper political influence over the Justice Department. They say Halligan's direct involvement in presenting the cases to the grand jury, rather than delegating to a line prosecutor, is a “structural defect” that makes the indictments void.

James's attorneys have made similar claims, calling her appointment “unlawful” and alleging she was placed in the job to target political opponents.

If the judge finds Halligan's appointment invalid, the Justice Department could be ordered to name a new prosecutor, but legal experts say dismissal of the indictments themselves would require a higher showing of prejudice or fundamental unfairness.

Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told the Washington Examiner that Halligan's personal role in obtaining the Comey indictment distinguishes her situation from other recent challenges to acting or interim U.S. attorneys. 

“It's unique in that she's the one who actually went into the grand jury to get the indictment,” Rahmani said. “Typically, the U.S. attorney is not personally handling the case. They're on the caption, but they're not even in the room.”

Rahmani said that the difference could complicate the outcome if Currie disqualifies Halligan. “The question is, if she's disqualified, is the grand jury indictment improper because she secured it herself? Would they have to reindict? Would there be a statute of limitations issue? That's what makes this case unique,” he said.

Even so, Rahmani said disqualification alone would not automatically void the indictments. “You'd need to show more than just a technical violation,” he said. “Even if she were unlawfully appointed, the defense has to show prejudice — that it was fundamentally unfair. That's a higher bar than simply removing her from the case.” He added that any order disqualifying or dismissing the prosecutions would likely trigger immediate appeals and could delay the current trial timelines.

The Comey case has also become entangled in a separate dispute over grand jury secrecy. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick, who oversees pretrial proceedings, rebuked prosecutors last week for what he described as an “indict first, investigate later” approach and ordered the government to produce late-September grand jury transcripts and audio for review.

Prosecutors, including Halligan and Department of Justice trial attorneys Tyler Lemons and Gabriel Diaz, quickly appealed to U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff, a Biden appointee, arguing that Fitzpatrick's order exceeded his authority and that Comey had not shown sufficient grounds to overcome grand jury secrecy. Nachmanoff largely upheld Fitzpatrick's discretion but sent the matter back for a more limited review of whether the defense has “particularized and factually based grounds” to justify disclosure.

At a brief status conference on Monday, the Justice Department agreed to provide all grand jury transcripts and audio for Fitzpatrick's private review, but not for Comey's defense team. Fitzpatrick said an in-camera review was necessary “to make an informed decision” about possible disclosure and will also consider an ex parte filing from Comey's lawyers describing alleged breaches of attorney-client privilege during the grand jury process, according to Law and Crime.

Comey's team argues those materials could show misconduct in Halligan's presentation to the grand jury, the first of her career, while prosecutors maintain that no privileged evidence was used and that nothing in the grand jury process supports dismissal.

Prosecutors have sought to bolster Halligan's standing, filing a certification on Nov. 3 that Attorney General Pam Bondi lawfully appointed Halligan as a special attorney on Sept. 22, the same day the Comey indictment was presented and ratified her grand jury actions to eliminate any procedural doubt.

Supporters, including Mike Davis, a close Trump ally and former chief judicial nominations counsel to Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), have defended Halligan's record. 

In a recent Federalist op-ed, Davis argued Halligan “proved her critics wrong” by filing evidence that he said “overwhelmingly demonstrates Comey's guilt,” including handwritten notes, emails sent under Comey's alias Reinhold Niebuhr, and communications with Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman that prosecutors allege show coordination with the media.

The Campaign for Accountability, a left-leaning watchdog group, filed complaints Tuesday with the Florida and Virginia state bars, urging Halligan's disbarment.

The group alleges she violated ethics rules by acting at Trump's direction and prosecuting cases that career officials deemed unsupportable. 

“The evidence appears to demonstrate that, absent President Trump's intervention, neither Mr. Comey nor Ms. James would have been indicted,” the complaint states.

Comey faces charges of making false statements and obstructing Congress for his 2020 Senate testimony about the FBI's handling of Hillary Clinton's private email investigation and related leaks to the media. He has pleaded not guilty and claims the prosecution stems from political motives rather than independent law enforcement.

James is charged with bank fraud for allegedly misrepresenting her intent to personally occupy a Virginia home purchased in 2020 with a $109,600 mortgage and allegedly acquiring nearly $20,000 in ill-gotten gains due to her alleged misrepresentation of her intent. She has pleaded not guilty and argues that the case represents an unlawful abuse of power.

Both defendants have so far focused their defenses on challenging Halligan's appointment and claiming selective or vindictive prosecution, rather than disputing the substance of the allegations themselves.

Currie has required the government to submit the full grand jury transcript ahead of Thursday's hearing, indicating close attention to Halligan's role in securing the indictments. Fitzpatrick, meanwhile, is completing his in-camera review of the grand jury materials and an ex parte defense submission regarding alleged breaches of privilege.

The federal courthouse in Alexandria was closed Tuesday for the Veterans Day holiday, but a ruling from Fitzpatrick on whether any grand jury materials can be shared with Comey's defense team could come as early as Wednesday. 

Trials for both Comey and James remain set for January in the Eastern District of Virginia's “rocket docket,” assuming no delays or appeals force the dates to be pushed back.

            Former Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia announced her campaign to return to Congress on Wednesday, aiming to recapture a key battleground district with more favorable midterm tailwinds next year.
    


            “I cannot sit back and watch as Republicans in Congress create chaos while failing to address the rising cost of living and the issues that matter to Coastal Virginians,” Luria said in a statement announcing her bid. “Virginians are hungry for change, and I look forward to getting back to work for Hampton Roads.”
    


            A Navy veteran, Luria was among several Democrats with national security backgrounds elected during the 2018 midterms of President Donald Trump's first term. She lost her seat four years later to GOP Rep. Jen Kiggans as Republicans won control of the US House during Democrat Joe Biden's term.
    


            Virginia Democrats are ascendant after sweeping the top three statewide offices in this month's off-year elections and making gains in the House of Delegates. National Democrats are optimistic that Trump's overall unpopularity could help them regain the House, particularly by flipping districts in blue-leaning states like Virginia.
    


            Luria could also benefit from a potential mid-decade redistricting under consideration by Virginia state lawmakers that could make it harder for Kiggans to win reelection.
    


            During her time in Congress, Luria established a moderate reputation, aligning with national security-focused moderates like Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger, who were elected the new governors of New Jersey and Virginia last week, respectively.
    


            She also served on the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot, accusing Trump of a “dereliction of duty.”

Senate Democrats have little time to cobble together a bill extending premium Obamacare subsidies with no guarantee that the legislation can pass, a bitter pill to swallow after weeks spent fighting with Republicans over healthcare.

There are just three weeks when the Senate is in session before mid-December, when Republicans committed to holding a vote on the subsidies as part of a shutdown deal. The vote was a meager concession as Republicans are not willing to promise the bill will get through Congress or be signed into law.

But the vote at least leaves the door open to a breakthrough, and the Democrats who negotiated that deal are urging their caucus not to squander the opportunity.

“We have to write a version that is good for our values, that helps people, but is also designed to get some Republican votes,” said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), one of seven Senate Democrats to vote to reopen the government on Monday. “If we write this bill in that sweet spot, I think we got a really strong chance of getting it passed.”

Congressional Republicans have shown some willingness to extend the Obamacare subsidies, subject to new limitations on income and language, eliminating “phantom enrollees.” Senators from both parties also want to pass regulations on pharmacy benefit managers, meaning there is fertile ground for a grand bargain on healthcare before the end of the year.

“There are Democrats and Republicans who are both interested in trying to do something in the healthcare space,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) said. “And clearly, there is a need.”

Yet most Democrats lack trust in their GOP colleagues and believe they would not commit to extending the subsidies because there is no real interest among leadership or the White House. In the House, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) will not agree to hold the same vote on Obamacare subsidies as President Donald Trump has more recently begun to propose legislation that could only draw Republican support.

“The government shutting down seemed to be an opportunity to lead us to better policy, but it didn't work,” said Senate Minority Leader Dick Durbin (D-IL), another Senate Democrat who sided with Republicans on Monday. “It worked to this extent — health insurance became a big issue — and we get our day in court in December [with a vote]. But this government shutdown itself did not achieve that.”

For now, Democrats are looking to a bloc of centrist Republicans interested in hammering out a healthcare deal. 

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), a retiring lawmaker known for his bipartisan deal-making, echoed other centrists in advocating a one-year extension coupled with a one- or two-year ramp-down. He made the case that a three-year plan would avoid midterm election drama yet not cut off benefits “cold turkey.”

“I don't think you'll see a straight one-year extension, because does anybody really want to go through this drama next year during an election cycle?” Tillis said. “You have to give people time to react, and this sort of cold turkey that people are going through now, they couldn't possibly plan for some of these increases.”

Kaine, for his part, expressed optimism that common ground could be found when it comes to “means testing … so that the benefits are really to low- and moderate-income people.”

Democrats concede that, with the shutdown behind them, they have limited leverage to extend the Obamacare subsidies. Republicans are generally reluctant to prop up a law passed by the Democrats and feel that the premium subsidies, a product of the coronavirus pandemic, should not have been reauthorized.

However, Republicans are also aware that healthcare could become a liability for them in the midterm elections next year, as out-of-pocket premiums are set to increase for more than 20 million people with plans through the Obamacare marketplace.

Multiple rank-and-file Republicans are beginning to draft their own legislative proposals on how to address the rising cost of healthcare, while the top Republicans on the relevant committees are also expected to be engaged.

SENATE PASSES BILL TO END GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, TEEING UP HOUSE RETURN

Sen. Andy Kim (D-NJ) was among the frustrated Democrats to lambast the shutdown-ending funding deal, calling it a “disgrace” and a “setback” while also urging the party to “regroup.”

“In the same chamber where the nation watched Senator McCain show courage in saving the ACA, now we see a vote that will lead to millions losing healthcare,” Kim said in a post on X. “There is no excusing this. It's a huge setback. But we must regroup, expose the cruelty of Trump's actions, and never stop fighting for the right of healthcare for every American.”

            Entering the winemaking business is not for the faint of heart. Doing so with no prior experience, on the edge of a desert where temperatures hit 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit), might be considered foolhardy. But for Rudie van Vuuren, the gamble paid off.
    


            Van Vuuren is the managing director of Neuras Wine and Wildlife Estate, 140 miles south of Windhoek, Namibia. Situated in the foothills of the Naukluft Mountains, on the fringe of the Namib Desert, the boutique operation is, according to its owners, the driest vineyard outside of the Atacama Desert in Chile. Wrangling a hostile climate as well as hungry baboons, Neuras has plotted a journey from amateur enthusiasm to award-winning winemaking, putting this remote corner of Africa on the grape-growing map.
    


            In recent years the tiny vineyard has won international medals, including golds and double golds, for its red wine, ruby dessert wine and “nappa” (a spirit similar to grappa).
    


            The winery manager says that none of this would have happened without the unlikely help of a leopard called Lightning.
    


            Van Vuuren had lived multiple lives before pursuing winemaking. A medical doctor who was also a member of the Namibian national cricket and rugby teams —and who played at World Cups in both sports — he became a conservationist.



            In 2009, Van Vuuren was in a helicopter, tracking a leopard, Lightning, which had been rescued then released into the wild. Suddenly below him appeared a desert oasis. The land, he learned, belonged to a retired Shell executive who had nurtured vines on a small area of his 14,500-hectare tract. Van Vuuren descended to inform him there was a big cat on his property and fell in love with the vineyard — and its wine.
    


            “I went back and told Marlice (﻿van Vuuren, Rudie's wife) about the place and she just said, ‘Is there water? What's the camp look like? What do the roads look like?'” he recalled. “I said, ‘I didn't look at any of that, I just looked at the wine — and we're going to buy Neuras.'”
    


            In 2011, the vineyard and surrounding land became part of the couple's conservation program, the Naankuse Foundation.
    


            “It was perfect,” said Van Vuuren. The site could be used as a release point for animals into the neighboring Namib Naukluft National Park, “and on top of that, you had the economic engine of winemaking” — the proceeds of which could fund their conservation work.
    


            Without any professional knowledge of winemaking, the Van Vuurens' engine was never likely to hit top gear. It took the couple over a decade to hire the right person to elevate their part-time venture into a serious business. That person was South African winemaker Braam Gericke.
    


            Gericke talks about winemaking in mystical terms (“it's not work, it's a form of art;” “you don't change vineyards based on what you want; vineyards change you”) but his deft touch has paid dividends. “He was the one who cracked the code,” said Van Vuuren.
    


            Grapes are grown under netting to keep off hungry baboons and kudus (large antelopes) that roam the area. Each January, half a dozen employees harvest grapes by hand between 6 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. precisely, says Gericke, before the heat of the day sets in. After barrel fermentation for 12-18 months, a “really old school” manual bottling line is set up, where no more than 200 bottles of a given wine are produced in a season.
    


            “I like to think of it as Old World winemaking meeting New World winemaking,” he added.
    


            The location's secret sauce is how the vines are watered. In a region that can receive as little as 5mm (less than half an inch) of annual rainfall, Neuras has the good fortune of sitting on a basin with five underground freshwater springs.
    


            “It's the purest form of water that you can get,” said Gericke. He says the water has been carbon dated and takes 1,800 years to reach the point where it is collected and used in a drip irrigation system.
    


            “We considered expanding the vineyard when we started being successful, and then sanity prevailed,” said Van Vuuren. In fact, he explained, a water study of the property found that the vineyard couldn't expand with the available resources.
    


            “We now respect what nature has decided for us. We're going to keep the vineyard small (and) we are going to make sure the quality is where it is now, and gets even better,” he added.
    


            The skill of Gericke and his team, as well as time and weather, will play a large part in the vineyard's future success.
    


            Climate change is making winemaking an increasingly volatile business. Many wine growing regions around the world could be unsuitable for grape growing should the planet breach 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of human-induced climate change, according to a 2024 report. The race is on for winemakers: vineyards are ripping up vines to replace them with more resilient varieties, and some European producers are looking north to land with similar growing conditions to futureproof their businesses (see: champagne houses buying up parts of Kent in the UK).
    


            Does Neuras offer a blueprint for success?
    


            “We grow and make wine in extreme conditions. Intense heat, little rain … (and) climate change (is) only amplifying that,” said Van Vuuren. “So instead of resisting, we try and learn to adapt.”
    


            “Our water management approach takes every element into consideration: cultivar, temperature, soil composition, depth of the vine's roots. It's a science on its own,” he added. “You have to listen to the vine. It tells you what it needs and when.”
    


            That said, Neuras has one eye on necessary changes. The vineyard is exploring growing Pinotage, a red grape, known for its resilience and lower water requirements, said Van Vuuren, on an unconventional trellis system better suited to dry conditions.
    


            “While water limits physical expansion, it inspires smarter viticulture,” he added.

Democrats tried their hardest to convince the country that the government shutdown was the fault of President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. They relied on every political weapon at their disposal. They used their accomplices in the media. They used celebrities to advance their political narratives. They unleashed their social media army of trolls to constantly smear the GOP in hopes of persuading the public that the Republicans were responsible for the shutdown.

Yet, in the end, like so many times before with Democrats, they were the ones doing the very thing they accused Republicans of doing. And Trump and the Republicans broke them from continuing their harmful and divisive political games.

Consider the words of House Minority Whip Rep. Katherine Clark (D-MA), who said the quiet part out loud. During an interview on Fox News, Clark admitted — perhaps mistakenly, perhaps in a moment of rare political truth from a left-wing politician —  that the government shutdown was an opportunity for Democrats to gain political leverage, even if people were suffering.

“Shutdowns are terrible,” Clark said. “And of course, there will be families that are going to suffer. We take that responsibility very seriously. But it is one of the few leverage times we have.”

Leverage. Democrats repeatedly went on their soapboxes and preached about the shutdown hurting people when, in reality, the only thing they cared about was political power and using perceived “leverage” to amass more of it. They didn't care about any suffering. They gleefully accepted it and viewed it as necessary collateral damage. It is similar to the Democrats' antics during the COVID-19 pandemic when they openly admitted they were taking advantage of the worldwide emergency to benefit their political agenda.

It's all part of their “never let a crisis go to waste” political strategy, a sentiment embraced by Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC).

“This is a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision,” Clyburn said in the middle of the health crisis during the deadly pandemic. And if they were willing to let people die during a pandemic to advance a political agenda, clearly, they had no problem with people enduring hardships during a government shutdown. And so Democrats went on media circuits and talk shows and repeatedly lied to the people over and over and over again.

Consider their rhetoric. For weeks, a common refrain by Democratic politicians was that the shutdown was due to Republicans. “Republicans control the presidency, the House, and the Senate,” they would say. This message was disseminated through every available medium. Republicans held the majority and were the ones who could and should reopen the government.

So, Republicans did.

It was never true, of course, and Democrats knew it all along. Hence, Republicans needed eight Democrats to join them. They were, as usual, lying to the public. And, when Republicans did use their majority to vote to open the government, it was the Democrats, once again, trying to sabotage those efforts and obstruct the government from opening. Fortunately, eight Democrats had enough decency and common sense to go against their party's line.

WHY DID DEMOCRATS FIGHT SO LONG — BEFORE CAVING?

This stunt should cost the Democrats, politically. They should lose a ton of credibility with the public. They should be deemed untrustworthy. Their narrative, even before the shutdown began, was dishonest and deceptive, predicated on advancing a political agenda rather than prioritizing the welfare of the people. 

Typically, they would weaponize their accomplices in the media to influence and persuade public opinion. They used it the last time there was a government shutdown when Trump was president. It was a tactic Democrats used this time, too. The difference was that Trump and Republicans were privy to their tactics and did not cave. They stood firm and refused to acquiesce. They knew they were on the right side of history on this and were not going to surrender. 

Unfortunately, with the monopoly in legacy media, the truth will get convoluted, and the narrative will become misrepresented. The Democrats' lemmings and foot soldiers will try to position this as a political win, even though it was an embarrassing defeat. But if there is ever any justice, it is that the people, especially those affected by the shutdown, will realize any pain they endured during this time was due to Democratic political games.

I write about sleep products for a living, so trust me — I know good bedding. As Black Friday sales start early ahead of Thanksgiving, I'm already tracking the best early Black Friday bedding deals to help you save on a bedroom upgrade. Shop early and you can have your guest room perfectly outfitted before holiday visitors arrive.

Currently, our favorite weighted blanket of all time, the Bearaby Cotton Napper is 15% off. It's rare to find deals on Bearaby's flagship product, so I definitely recommend checking out this sale. I'm also impressed by the 30% discount you can snag on The Company Store Air Layer Quilt when using code BFDEALS25 at checkout.  Tons of the brand's bedding staples are on sale, with some basics on sale for as much as 40% off.

I'll be updating this article with the newest deals over the next few weeks, as while the cozy savings are heating up, some heavy hitters like Brooklinen, Parachute, and Coyuchi don't start their Black Friday deals until closer to Thanksgiving. For more early deals, check out our Black Friday coverage and early Black Friday pillow and mattress deals. 

Target's Threshold sheets — the ultra-silky, comfortable budget pick in our best sheets guide — are currently 30% off, reducing the price of a queen from $55 to $38.50. If you're on the hunt for premium bedding, Cozy Earth's bamboo sheets are 20% off, for over $60 of savings on a queen set. Meanwhile, if you're after the coziest flannel sheets, Boll & Branch has introduced prints and designs with a pretty whipstitch detail that are part of the site's 20% off sitewide sale.


                          Target's affordable Threshold sheet set is soft and holds up over time so you won't have to worry about pilling or shrinking. 
                        


                      These Cozy Earth sheets are the most cooling on our list with deep pockets for mattresses up to 20 inches thick. With prices starting at $289 for a twin set, these are an investment.
                    


                      Boll & Branch's flannel sheets are durable and provide breathability for warmer months and cozy warmth for winter, making them ideal for year-round use. 
                    


                      The cool, airy, and beautiful linen sheets from Sijo will be your summer favorite, or if you regularly sleep hot, a durable yearlong standby.
                    


                      The Company Store Velvet Flannel Sheets offer a perfect balance of thickness, durability, and breathability while maintaining a velvety soft, cozy feel. This set is ideal for hot sleepers who still want the warmth and comfort of flannel during colder months. 
                    


                      The Eddie Bauer Flannel Sheets are half the price of competitors and come in the most fun prints and patterns. They're comfortable but not quite as soft as our other top picks.
                    

Silk & Snow is currently hosting an impressive early Black Friday sale with it's lowest prices of the year, including 20% off the down alternative comforter, bringing it too under $100. It was the top down alternative comforter that we tested for our best comforter guide, with a lightweight, airy feel. For quilt lovers, you can take 30% off The Company Store Air Layer Jersey Quilt with code BFDEALS25. Soft and cozy, it was our favorite cotton quilt. Though, the Company Store's best comforter deal may just be 40% off the Lacrosse Premium LoftAIRE™ Down Alternative Comoforter in light, medium, or extra warmth weights.


                          The Silk & Snow down alternative comforter is a cozy hypoallergenic option with a plush microfiber fill that available in three weights that doesn't sacrifice quality or luxury.
                        


                      The Rest Evercool comforter is one of the coolest and most versatile options we tested, offering exceptional breathability and a silky-smooth feel in various colors and sizes, ensuring a sweat-free and comfortable night's sleep.
            
                    


                      The Brooklinen All-Season Down Comforter is a soft, light, and comfortable choice that's airy and warm but remains breathable so you can use it any time of the year.
                    


                      The Garnet Hill Agnes Linen Quilt is the best quilt we've tried, with premium fabric, a classic handmade-inspired look, and comfort for all seasons. 
                    


                      The Company Store Air Layer Jersey quilt feels like your favorite well-worn cotton T-shirt, with a lightweight texture that's great for layering. 
                    


                      The super-soft  Buffy Breeze Comforter, with a shell and fill made from 100% eucalyptus, is naturally breathable and cool to the touch.
                    

If you take advantage of one Black Friday bedding deal, I recommend saving on the Coop Original Pillow. You get our favorite pillow of all time for 25% off at Coop. For other great pillow sales, check out our early Black Friday pillow deals coverage. 


                          The Coop Sleep Goods Original Pillow offers thoughtful features like adjustable fill, a washable pillow cover, and an unparalleled 100-night trial, making it the best choice for most people.
                        


                      Soft and moldable but still supportive, the Boll & Branch Down Chamber Pillow comes in three firmness levels, including a soft option for stomach sleepers.
                    


                       The Birch Organic pillow combines premium organic materials like wool and cotton for a comfortable, temperature-balanced sleep experience, featuring GREENGUARD Gold & GOTS certifications for eco-friendly assurance.
                    


                      For those seeking a pillow that's exceptionally soft, breathable, and promises a fresh start every morning, the Cozy Earth Silk pillow is definitely worth considering. 
            
                    


                      The Easy Breather Pillow's luxurious feel and durable construction, combined with its cooling properties, make it a great option for anyone seeking personalized comfort and reliable temperature regulation. 
                    


                      Whether you want to knot it up for lounging on the couch, prop your feet on it, or snuggle up for a cozy night's sleep, the Buffy Wiggle Pillow offers great full-body support. It's also sustainably made. 
                    

Besides sheets, comforters, and pillows, we're also seeing savings on bedding accessories like weighted blankets and silk pillowcases. The Bearaby Cotton Weighted Blanket — the longstanding top pick in our best weighted blanket guide — is 15% off on Bearaby's site. It's an aesthetically-pleasing knit weighted blanket that gets its heft from a heavyweight cotton yarn. Don't forget the essentials either, like the best mattress protector. Our top pick, from Coop is under $50 at Amazon. Or, scoop up the best mattress topper to give an extra level of comfort to your bed. Our top pick from Helix is 27% off with code INSIDER27.


                      The cocoon-like, knit-woven Bearaby Cotton Napper keeps you cozy yet cool as you lounge on the couch. The 40-by-64-inch 10-pound blanket is entirely machine washable and made of 100% cotton.
                    


                      This double-sided throw is surprisingly weighty, so it feels like a warm, relaxing hug. Between the weight of the blanket, the quality and softness of the material, and the ease of washability, this wins our vote as the comfiest faux fur blanket on the list. We just wish it came in more than three colors.
                    


                      Coop's mattress protector protects against small spills, big accidents, and dust mites. It's also virtually silent, with no annoying crinkling noises to disturb your slumber. 
                    


                      Slip's Silk Pillowcase is smooth on the skin and hair, preventing frizziness and irritation. We also love its range of bright colors and fun designs. 
                    


                      The Helix Premium Mattress Topper with GlacioTex has layers of foam and microcoils for unmatched comfort and support. 
            
                    


                      The Avocado Organic Waterproof Mattress Protector is made of eco-friendly materials while still providing impressive waterproofing.
                    

We typically see the lowest prices of the year on bedding during Black Friday. There are pros and cons to shopping early — for one, shopping early sales could help you refresh your guest room before Thanksgiving. At the same time, many retailers actually offer better deals on the day, during traditional Black Friday sales. While Black Friday, in general, is a great time to upgrade bedding, we recommend considering whether you should shop early or wait.

We've covered many types of bedding over the years, ranging from sheets to silk pillowcases. Some of our all time favorites are on sale for Black Friday, including the Bearaby Cotton Weighted Blanket (15% off), the Brooklinen Luxe Sateen Sheet Set (15% off), and the Coop Sleep Goods Original Pillow (25% off).

Waymo robotaxis will now take passengers on freeways in three major U.S. cities, marking a major milestone for the driverless, ride-hailing company.

Alphabet-owned Waymo on Wednesday said it will begin offering those types of trips in the San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles markets "when a freeway route is meaningfully faster." The Google sister company will gradually extend freeway trips to more riders and locations over time.

Although Waymo's driverless cars have previously taken passengers on smaller highways and side streets, Wednesday's expansion marks the first time the company will take payment from public riders to go on freeways with higher speed limits.

"Freeway driving is one of those things that's very easy to learn, but very hard to master when we're talking about full autonomy without a human driver as a backup, and at scale," Waymo co-CEO Dmitri Dolgov said at a press event ahead of the announcement. "It took time to do it properly."

Waymo vehicles will generally travel up to a freeway's maximum posted speed limit, which is 65 mph in many cases, the company said. However, a spokesperson confirmed, the robotaxis may sometimes go a few miles over the limit for safety purposes in extraordinary circumstances.

Freeway operations required expanded operational protocols, including coordination with safety officials at the California Highway Patrol and the Arizona Department of Public Safety, Waymo said. The company also installed additional infrastructure needed to charge its fleet of electric robotaxis given the freeway expansion.

Over the last year, Waymo has offered select Alphabet employees robotaxi freeway rides around San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix in preparation for Wednesday's launch, said Waymo Product Manager Jacopo Sannazzaro.

The company has been testing on freeways for more than a decade in total, he added. Besides testing on public roads and closed courses, Waymo also conducts testing in simulation to determine how its vehicles will respond to both typical and hard-to-replicate events, like merging onto freeways, lane-splitting motorcyclists or another car flipping over.

CNBC took a freeway test ride in a Waymo in the San Francisco Bay Area, from YouTube's offices in San Bruno to San Mateo and back. The ride went on and off ramps along the California 101 seamlessly, with no incidents.

After already launching its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles, Waymo has also announced plans to expand to Miami, San Diego and Washington, D.C., in 2026. The company is also testing its vehicles in New York City, Tokyo and plans to begin offering rides to the public in London next year.

Waymo on Wednesday also announced that it's expanding its service footprint in the San Francisco Bay Area to San Jose. That includes rides to and from San Jose Mineta International Airport, marking the company's second international airport destination. The SJC airport plans were first announced in September.

In 2023, Waymo launched at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, which has become its most popular destination in the Phoenix metropolitan service area.

The company expanded its service in March to include an additional 27 square miles of coverage in the region, including cities like Mountain View and Palo Alto. After the Wednesday expansion, Waymo now offers service in about 260 square miles of Silicon Valley.

Would-be Waymo competitor Tesla also takes passengers to and from SJC. Customers can hail a ride via Tesla's "Robotaxi" app, but that name is not precisely descriptive. Tesla only operates a car service with human drivers on board, not a commercial robotaxi service like Waymo's, due to a mix of technical limits and permit requirements in California.

Israel-Iran War:

IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi

United Nations nuclear inspectors said they are seriously concerned about the status of Iran's inventory of near-bomb-grade uranium, as the Islamic Republic continues to deny them access to sites bombed several months ago by the US and Israel.

The International Atomic Energy Agency reiterated it hasn't been able to verify Iran's fuel stockpile since mid-June, according to documents seen by Bloomberg. It's the first IAEA report since the UN security council reimposed sanctions that demand Iran suspend enrichment activities.

Anthropic announced plans Wednesday to spend $50 billion on a U.S. artificial intelligence infrastructure build-out, starting with custom data centers in Texas and New York.

The facilities, which will be designed to support the company's rapid enterprise growth and its long-term research agenda, will be developed in partnership with Fluidstack.

Fluidstack is an AI cloud platform that supplies large-scale graphics processing unit, or GPU, clusters to clients like Meta, Midjourney and Mistral.

Additional sites are expected to follow, with the first locations going live in 2026. The project is expected to create 800 permanent jobs and more than 2,000 construction roles.

The investment positions Anthropic as a major domestic player in physical AI infrastructure at a moment when policymakers are increasingly focused on U.S.-based compute capacity and technological sovereignty.

"We're getting closer to AI that can accelerate scientific discovery and help solve complex problems in ways that weren't possible before. Realizing that potential requires infrastructure that can support continued development at the frontier," said CEO Dario Amodei. "These sites will help us build more capable AI systems that can drive those breakthroughs, while creating American jobs."

The move comes as Anthropic rival OpenAI pushes forward with an aggressive build-out of its own. The ChatGPT maker has secured more than $1.4 trillion in long-term infrastructure commitments through deals with Nvidia, Broadcom, Oracle and the major cloud providers, including Microsoft, Google, and, most recently, Amazon.

The scale of that spending has raised questions about whether the U.S. has the power capacity and industrial backbone to deliver on such promises, and whether the AI sector is drifting into bubble territory.

Anthropic serves more than 300,000 businesses, with enterprise clients driving most of its revenue.

The number of large accounts, which generate more than $100,000 annually, has nearly increased sevenfold in the past year. Internal projections obtained by The Wall Street Journal showed Anthropic expects to break even by 2028, well ahead of OpenAI, which is projecting $74 billion in operating losses that same year.

To support that trajectory, Anthropic tapped Fluidstack to build custom facilities optimized for its AI workloads, citing the firm's speed and ability to deliver gigawatts of power on short timelines.

In parallel, Amazon has opened a dedicated data center campus for Anthropic on 1,200 acres in Indiana.

The $11 billion facility is already up and running, while many competitors are still promising data centers of the future. Anthropic has also expanded its compute deal with Google by tens of billions of dollars.

The move also comes as the role of the federal government in financing AI infrastructure becomes a flashpoint.

Last week, OpenAI asked the Trump administration to expand a key CHIPS Act tax credit to include AI data centers and grid components like transformers, according to a letter obtained by Bloomberg.

That request followed backlash over comments from CFO Sarah Friar, who had floated the idea of a government "backstop" for OpenAI's compute deals.

Though the company has since walked back the suggestion of federal guarantees, the episode underscored the political and financial uncertainty surrounding how — and by whom — America's AI infrastructure will be funded.

A fired executive at WPP is suing the advertising agency giant, accusing the company of retaliating against him and firing him after he raised concerns that the group's media investment division was allegedly running an improper kickback operation.

Richard Foster spent 17 years working for GroupM, WPP's media arm, which controls more than $60 billion in advertising spending for clients such as Google, Unilever, and Ford. GroupM rebranded to become WPP Media this year.

Foster was formerly the global chief executive of Motion Content Group, a division of GroupM/WPP Media that produces and co-finances TV series such as "Love Island" and brokers other entertainment partnerships.

The lawsuit says that Foster grew increasingly concerned about a practice within GroupM's trading division known as "volume-based discounts." GroupM would leverage the power of its billions of dollars in client ad budgets to secure incentives from media owners — such as cash rebates or free or discounted inventory — but not always disclose or pass these back to clients, the lawsuit alleges.

In short, Foster alleges in the suit that WPP had created a hidden way of generating profit and wasn't acting in the interest of its advertiser clients. He claims that when he brought this to top management, the agency group reacted by firing him rather than investigating his concerns.

Receiving media rebates isn't illegal in the US. That said, the ad industry has previously been warned by legal experts that rebates could amount to a breach of contract or even fraud if not disclosed to the client or if advertisers were deceived about the practice. Public companies are required to accurately record all income, including rebates, in their financial statements.

"The scale of this purchasing power enabled GroupM to leverage their client spend to force many ad-supported television and media platforms to give GroupM discounts, which, rather than being passed back to clients, GroupM turned into a non-disclosed profit center," Foster's lawsuit says.

The lawsuit says Foster estimated that over the past five years, GroupM generated between $3 billion and $4 billion by striking rebate-driven deals, of which the agency improperly retained approximately $1.5 to $2 billion. The suit doesn't provide further documentation to support this claim.

"The Company is aware of a lawsuit in the New York State Court filed by a former employee who was let go in a recent organizational restructuring," said a WPP spokesperson in a statement. "The court has not yet made any findings in relation to the allegations and we will defend them vigorously."

The topic of agency kickbacks set a dark cloud over the ad industry a decade ago. In 2015, Jon Mandel, a former WPP media agency exec, gave a presentation at a marketing conference that alleged agency rebates and kickbacks were a widespread practice in the US. The following year, the Association of National Advertisers, a US trade body, published a bombshell report by the corporate investigations firm K2 Intelligence, which alleged rebates and other non-transparent business practices were "pervasive" among US media agencies. Big agency groups at the time slammed the report as inflammatory, criticized its methodology, and broadly denied wrongdoing.

In reaction to the report, some advertisers renegotiated their contracts or audited their media agencies to push for more transparency. In 2018, federal prosecutors in Manhattan initiated an investigation into media-buying practices in the US, The Wall Street Journal reported, though no criminal charges have been brought.

Foster's lawsuit catapults the controversial rebates issue into the present day. It comes at a rocky time for WPP, which has said it expects to report a second consecutive annual revenue decline this year. The company's share price has more than halved in the year to date, with the group having lost key media accounts, including many in the US, to rivals such as Publicis Groupe and Omnicom.

Foster said he repeatedly raised concerns over the years with senior WPP and GroupM executives, including Nicola McCormick, WPP's general counsel for media, that rebate deals were unethical and posed a significant legal risk to the company, the lawsuit alleges.

In October 2024, Brian Lesser, the newly appointed global CEO of GroupM, requested a meeting with Foster and asked him for a "candid assessment" of the division's operations, including any potential issues, the lawsuit says. Foster says he also detailed his recommendations to develop a new WPP Entertainment division, to build on what he had achieved with Motion Content Group.

Upon Lesser's request, Foster submitted a 35-page report after the meeting that included a section outlining his concerns about GroupM's rebate practices, the lawsuit says.

Foster estimated in the report that GroupM derived nearly $1 billion in global net sales from "non-product-related income," such as rebates and "purchase risk" media deals. In "purchase risk deals," the agency would use its collective client spending power to buy large blocks of advertising inventory upfront to obtain pricing discounts, and then sell it back to clients through opt-in agreements.

Foster claims many large advertisers were opposed to such deals because they were designed to benefit an agency's bottom line rather than the client's.

The suit appears to describe a form of what's known in the industry as principal media buying, so-called because by buying inventory and reselling it to clients, agencies act as a "principal," or vendor. A report published last year by the ANA found that principal media buying was on the rise at holding companies due to downward pressure on agency margins and a push from marketers to bring down media prices. The report found that principal media can save advertisers between 10% and 15% in media costs, but some marketers had concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the quality of the media they were purchasing.

The lawsuit says that in a phone call with Foster in January of this year, Lesser initially expressed concerns about potential risks tied to such deals, but later asked him via text to reproduce a "sanitized" version of his report to exclude any overt criticism of GroupM's trading operations. Unbeknownst to Foster, Lesser had already sent a copy of the original report to Mark Patterson, the executive responsible for GroupM's trading activities. Patterson is currently WPP Media's global president of markets and business operations.

Hours after that text, the suit says, Foster was "blindsided" by a restructure announcement that saw the sports and entertainment divisions report directly to Patterson. The following day, Patterson's role was changed to global president, with responsibility for the APAC and LATAM regions and the entertainment and sport divisions.

Foster alleges in the lawsuit that he was then immediately excluded from key meetings, cut out of deals, and isolated from decision-making. In July, GroupM terminated Foster without cause, the lawsuit says.

"At no point did WPP or WPP Media conduct a formal review or investigation into Foster's reports, as required under their compliance policies and applicable whistleblower protection laws, nor was corrective action ever taken," the lawsuit says.

The lawsuit, filed in the New York State Supreme Court, is seeking more than $100 million in damages for charges of retaliation, wrongful termination, and violations of whistleblower protection laws. William A. Brewer III, partner at Brewer, Attorneys & Counselors, is lead counsel to Foster.

Correction: November 12, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated the lawsuit's characterization of Foster's conversation with former WPP CEO Mark Read. It also misstated a change of roles within the company. Patterson's role, not Foster's, was changed to global president, with responsibility for the APAC and LATAM regions and the entertainment and sport divisions.

Coinbase is following Tesla out of Delaware and into Texas.

Paul Grewal, Coinbase's chief legal officer, wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Wednesday that the crypto exchange is moving its state of incorporation, a year after Elon Musk did the same with his electric vehicle maker. Musk also reincorporated his rocket maker SpaceX from Delaware to Texas.

"Delaware's legal framework once provided companies with consistency. But no more," Grawal wrote, pointing to recent "unpredictable outcomes" in the Delaware Chancery Court.

A handful of notable names, including Dropbox, TripAdvisor and venture firm Andreessen Horowitz have announced departures from Delaware. It's a move that was championed by Musk following a Delaware Chancery Court ruling that ordered Tesla to rescind the CEO's 2018 pay package, worth about $56 billion in options.

"If your company is still incorporated in Delaware, I recommend moving to another state as soon as possible," Musk wrote in a post on X in February 2024, when he filed to change SpaceX's incorporation state.

Last week, Tesla shareholders voted to approve Musk's more recent pay package, which could be worth up to $1 trillion.

Delaware has long been the dominant state for U.S. companies to incorporate due to its flexible corporate code and expert judiciary, and is seen as balancing the rights of executives and shareholders. A Texas state law allows corporations to limit shareholder lawsuits against insiders for breach of fiduciary duty. 

Coinbase and Andreessen Horowitz, an early backer, currently face a lawsuit in Delaware concerning the sale of shares in the crypto company tied to its public listing in 2021.

Like Musk, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong was a major contributor to President Donald Trump's 2024 campaign for the White House.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average surged to a new record close yesterday. But the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite sat out of the gains, as key artificial intelligence stocks floundered.

Here's the rundown:

While the government shutdown could be over soon, don't expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics to release all the missed economic data immediately.

As CNBC's Jeff Cox reports, government agencies will need time to catch up on data collection. If the shutdown ends this week, Goldman Sachs estimated that the BLS could have a schedule for when it would release reports — but not the data itself — out early next week.

Market watchers are especially eager to see what job market data will say, as other data sources point to loosening in the labor force. Adding to the uncertainty is the rise of "ghost job" postings, a term used to describe listings for open roles that have never appeared to be filled.

President Donald Trump floated a tariff rebate check over the weekend. Experts are warning you shouldn't hold your breath.

Policy analysts and economists told CNBC's Jessica Dickler that Trump's idea of paying Americans a "dividend" of at least $2,000 — except for "high income people" — likely wouldn't happen anytime soon. They also warned that this type of economic stimulus could drive up inflation.

Speaking of tariffs, CNBC's Lori Ann LaRocco reported that U.S. importers are expecting a simple repayment process if the Supreme Court rules against Trump's levies and forces a refund.

The Senate Agriculture Committee this week released a draft of its part of a market structure bill for digital assets, a major step toward greater investor adoption of cryptocurrencies. 

The draft lays out a framework for how to place guardrails on the industry and institutions that want to utilize digital assets. Cody Carbone, CEO of crypto trade association Digital Chamber, called it "the most consequential roadmap" for how institutions will utilize these currencies.

Here are our biggest takeaways from the draft.

On, the Swiss sportswear company, isn't seeing the same slowdown as other shoe makers. The company reported better-than-expected earnings and raised its guidance this morning, saying it wouldn't need to offer Black Friday deals to juice demand. Shares of On surged nearly 9% in premarket trading.

Elsewhere in fitness, Oura CEO Tom Hale told CNBC in an exclusive interview that the smart ring maker could see $2 billion in sales in 2026, almost doubling sales for a second straight year. Oura raised $900 million in a funding round last month, bringing its value to $11 billion. But public market investors shouldn't get too excited: Hale said there's "no news on an IPO" for the Finnish company. 

Consumer sentiment varies significantly by the amount of stocks individuals hold. Click here to read more about how the biggest owners are buoying economic confidence, and what could change that.

In this article

Autonomous EV freight trucking company Einride is planning to go public on the New York Stock Exchange through a SPAC deal with Legato Merger Corp. III, a blank check company, valuing it at $1.8 billion.

The deal is expected to raise $219 million in gross proceeds, with up to an additional $100 million in PIPE capital from institutional investors, with Einride to begin trading during the first half of 2026.

In announcing its plans, the Stockholm, Sweden-based company reported a contracted annual recurring revenue base of $65 million and over $800 million in potential long-term ARR.

Founded in 2016, Einride has over 25 customers across seven countries, and regulatory permits in the United States and Europe. Its current fleet of approximately 200 electric vehicles is used by customers including GE Appliances and Swedish online pharmacy company Apotea.

"Today marks a defining moment for Einride and for the future of freight technology," saidRoozbeh Charli, CEO of Einride, in a release. "We've proven the technology, built trust with global customers, and shown that autonomous and electric operations are not just possible, but better. This transaction positions us to accelerate our global expansion and continue to deliver with speed and precision for our customers," said Charli, who took over the CEO post from co-founder and previous CEO Robert Falck last May.

Einride has made the CNBC Disruptor 50 list for three consecutive years, ranking No. 24 in 2025.

Freight trucking in the U.S. and elsewhere, estimated by Einride at a $4.6 trillion market, is both carbon-intensive and inefficient. Einride's technology is designed to reduce emissions at scale and prove electric freight is viable both technologically and economically.

PepsiCo is among the companies that has piloted use of Einride freight solutions, in markets including the U.S., Germany, and Memphis, Tennessee. Heineken added EV freight routes between the Netherlands and Germany in 2024, and to Austria. Einride also has plans to deploy 300 electric trucks across Europe by 2030 with Mars.

To date, Einride provides freight services for both driver-operated electric trucks and heavy-duty autonomous EV trucks. Its technology can be licensed to third parties, both operational planning AI software and its autonomous driving system.

In May of last year, Einride signed a deal with DP World to deploy the largest autonomous EV fleet in the Middle East, at the major UAE port, Jebel Ali, one of the world's largest shipping points.

While many of its deals to date are for EV and not autonomous technology, in the U.S. it marked a year of autonomous operations with GE Appliances in 2024, and began autonomous freight shipments with Swedish online pharmacy company Apotea, Europe's first daily autonomous freight trips.

The U.S. is the company's second-largest market and it plans to continue to invest in the country to accelerate deployment of its autonomous systems. In all, Einride reports over 1,700 driverless hours in contracted customer operations, over 11 million electric miles driven, and over 350,000 executed shipments.

"This transaction with Einride aligns with our vision to bring industry-leading, innovative technology to the public markets," said Eric Rosenfeld, chief SPAC officer of Legato, in the release. "Einride's proven customer relationships, regulatory achievements, and technology platform position the Company to be a leader in the transformation of the freight industry."

It competes with autonomous trucking companies including Aurora Innovation and fellow Disruptor Waabi, which recently hired Uber Freight CEO and founder Lior Ron as its chief operating officer.

According to data from Matthew Kennedy, senior strategist at Renaissance Capital, a provider of pre-IPO research and IPO-focused ETFs, Legato Merger III raised $175 million in its February 2024 IPO ($201 million including a deal overallotment). The management team's prior two SPACs produced Algoma Steel, a Canada-based steel producer that closed its merger with Legato I in October 2021, and Southland Holdings, an engineering and construction company that completed its merger with Legato II in Feb 2023. Both stocks are currently trading below their $10 transaction price. "This is not unusual for a de-SPAC, but it does highlight the general risk of holding into the merger that we've seen," Kennedy said.

The SPAC market is booming this year, raising nearly 200% more in proceeds than at the same point last year, according to Renaissance Capital data. It is the third-biggest year ever for SPACs, behind 2020 and 2021, measured in deal flow and proceeds, with Kennedy citing an acceleration in retail trading in tech companies, "which are the wheelhouse of SPAC merger activity," he said.

Transportation technology, in particular, has been a focus for SPAC mergers, including autonomous driving and electrification. Kennedy noted SPACs in the space have a mixed track record. Recent winners include electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft company Joby Aviation and EV battery tech company Quantumscape. But there have been a significant number of losers, he added, including EV trucking companies Nikola and Volta, and several EV companies focused on the consumer auto market: Vinfast, Faraday Future, Polestar, Lucid and Canoo. 

There is another trucking-focused SPAC deal underway between Plus.AI and Churchill Capital Corp IX.

A new, first-of-its-kind "drone wall" built to defeat Russia's most menacing weapons before they can reach cities and civilians is set to be deployed in Ukraine soon, its maker told Business Insider.

Comprised of dozens of small drones, the wall is designed to intercept an incoming munition by blowing them out of the sky, "like a flying drone minefield," said the founder of Atreyd, the Western company that developed the system.

Atreyd has already shipped the system to Ukraine, and it expects it to be operational within a few weeks, explained the founder, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive developments.

The drone wall's deployment will mark the first known instance of a defense of this type becoming operational in any conflict, giving Ukraine a new layer of protection against the worsening Russian air attacks.

The system will first be used to defend cities and critical infrastructure from Russia's one-way attack drones, but it could later be deployed closer to the front lines to protect against highly destructive glide bombs, which are notoriously difficult to intercept.

Russian one-way attack drones and glide bombs have been two of the most challenging threats Ukraine is facing. These weapons are cheap, can be mass-produced, strain defenses, and can be highly destructive.

One-way attack drones — specifically, the Russian Shahed-style loitering munitions — are employed in nightly attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure. Sometimes, hundreds are included in a single bombardment, which can overwhelm air defenses.

And glide bombs are dumb bombs equipped with special kits that turn them into precision-guided munitions able to be launched from aircraft at standoff ranges beyond the reach of Ukrainian air defenses. With small radar signatures, short flight times, and non-ballistic trajectories, these weapons are difficult to intercept.

NATO, which has closely monitored Russian threats, hosted an "Innovation Challenge" in March for Ukrainian and Western defense companies to submit solutions for combating this kind of weaponry. Atreyd, with its drone wall concept, emerged as a finalist.

The wall is made up of a collection of first-person-view drones that take off from designated launch platforms after radars detect a potential threat. The battery-powered drones, each carrying small explosive payloads, can then be layered and spaced apart.

Once airborne, these drones form something like a curtain in the sky; it's designed to blunt air attacks by having the drone components detonate near incoming munitions to neutralize the threat and send debris plummeting to the earth below.

"We consider ourselves as a last layer of defense," Atreyd's founder said.

The system relies on artificial intelligence to change the structure of the wall to best respond to the detected trajectory of an incoming munition. The system is designed to be cheap; the cost of interception is just a few thousand dollars, and the drones that don't detonate can return to their launch platforms to be used in a later air defense mission.

Atreyd said that the drone wall can operate in GPS-denied environments because it is equipped with a pre-installed 3D map of its area of responsibility, a notable feature given the widespread use of electronic warfare and signal jamming on the battlefields in Ukraine.

The drones can operate at altitudes of several thousand meters and are equipped with identification technology to prevent friendly fire incidents. And while the system is able to function fully autonomously, a human can still override the system and work a kill switch.

Atreyd said one soldier can typically operate 100 drones, and they don't need any specific qualifications, either, nor do they need to be an established drone pilot. They will only be trained on how to operate the system and activate the kill switch if necessary.

The drone wall has a 100% success rating in testing, Atreyd said. But its deployment to Ukraine will be the first time that the system faces actual combat conditions.

In Ukraine, the drone wall could be used to defend its cities, energy infrastructure, and other civilian areas that are regularly under fire from devastating Russian attacks.

Atreyd's founder would not disclose exactly where, in Ukraine, the drone wall will be deployed, citing operational security concerns. However, they said it will be permanently stationed there and can expand to other locations in the country with domestically manufactured drones.

While Atreyd is developing ambitious launch platforms — such as uncrewed vehicles, flying motherships, and even a zeppelin — for foreign militaries, the drone wall that is being deployed to Ukraine will take off from ground stations for now.

The drone wall's deployment comes as Russia has modified its drones and glide bombs with jet engines, enabling the weapons to travel faster and creating new headaches for Ukrainian air defenses. Atreyd's founder is confident that the system will still be effective against them.

Atreyd already has a contract with at least one NATO member that has put in an order for a launch platform and drones. So far, the company has organized production lines in France and Ukraine, and it expects to expand these efforts soon to the US.

NATO needs to be ready to face new developments in weaponry, the founder stressed. If the alliance is caught unprepared, "we are going to lose big."

Google filed a lawsuit Wednesday against a foreign cybercriminal group behind a massive SMS phishing, or "smishing," operation.

Dubbed by some cyber researchers as the "Smishing Triad," the organization, which Google said is largely based out of China, uses a phishing-as-a-service kit named "Lighthouse" to create and deploy attacks using fraudulent texts.

The crime group has amassed more than a million victims across 120 countries, Google said in a release.

"They were preying on users' trust in reputable brands such as E-ZPass, the U.S. Postal Service, and even us as Google," Google general counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado told CNBC. "The 'Lighthouse' enterprise or software creates a bunch of templates in which you create fake websites to pull users' information."

Google brought claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO, Act, the Lanham Act, and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or CFAA, and is seeking to dismantle the group and the Lighthouse platform.

The texts usually contain malicious links to a fake website designed to steal victims' sensitive financial information, including Social Security numbers, banking credentials and more.

The messages can often appear in the form of a fake fraud alert, delivery update, unpaid government fee notification, or other seemingly urgent texts.

The crime group has stolen approximately between 12.7 million and 115 million credit cards in the U.S. alone, Google said.

"The idea is to prevent its continued proliferation, deter others from doing something similarly, as well as protect both the users and brands that were misused in these websites from future harm," DeLaine Prado said.

The Alphabet-owned company said it has found more than 100 website templates generated by Lighthouse using Google's branding on sign-in screens to trick victims into thinking the sites were legitimate.

Internal and third-party investigations found that around 2,500 members of the syndicate were corresponding on a public Telegram channel to recruit more members, share advice, and test and maintain the Lighthouse software itself, DeLaine Prado said.

She added that the organization also had a "data broker" group, which supplied the list of potential victims and contacts, a "spammer" group, responsible for the SMS messages, and a "theft" group that would coordinate their attacks using the procured credentials on public Telegram channels.

Google said it's the first company to take legal action against SMS phishing scams and is additionally endorsing three bipartisan bills intended to protect against fraud and cyberattacks.

"While the lawsuit is one potential vector in which we can disrupt it, we also think that this type of cyber activity requires a policy-based approach," DeLaine Prado said.

The trio of bills includes the Guarding Unprotected Aging Retirees from Deception, or GUARD, Act, the Foreign Robocall Elimination Act, which would establish a task force targeting foreign illegal robocalls, and the Scam Compound Accountability and Mobilization Act, which targets scam compounds and supports survivors of human trafficking within the centers.

The litigation is part of Google's broader strategy to bring cyber protection awareness to users.

The company recently rolled out more safety features, including a Key Verifier tool and artificial intelligence-powered spam detection in Google Messages.

On raised its full-year guidance for the third quarter in a row on Wednesday after the Swiss sportswear company posted another three months of double-digit growth, bucking a slowdown in the sneaker market. 

The company, known for its innovative approach to running shoes, is now expecting 2025 sales to reach 2.98 billion Swiss francs ($3.72 billion), up from its previous guidance of 2.91 billion francs, on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, the company anticipates sales will grow 34% from the prior year, rising from its previous forecast of 31%. 

The forecast is slightly above the 2.97 billion francs analysts were expecting, according to LSEG. 

"Our focus on premium, on full-price sales, on innovation, on that intersection between performance and design is just resonating very strongly with the consumer, and it's really setting ourselves apart," CEO Martin Hoffmann told CNBC in an interview. "You see it in the results. We have strong top-line growth, we have a strong margin, so that shows that we stay fully committed to full-price sales, and this is across all our channels."

Shares of On jumped more than 20% in morning trading Wednesday in New York.

During its 2025 third quarter, the sportswear company beat Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines. 

Here's how On performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Sept. 30 was 118.9 million francs, or 36 cents per share, compared with 30.5 million francs, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding one-time items, On posted earnings of 43 cents per share.

Sales rose to 794.4 million francs, up about 25% from roughly 636 million francs a year earlier. 

On's rosy results come as competitors like Nike and Hoka plan for either a sales decline or slowdown in growth, as discretionary spending stagnates and tariffs take a bite out of shoppers' wallets. In late September, Nike said it was expecting sales in its current quarter, which runs generally from early September to early December, to fall by a low single-digit percentage as it works to reignite innovation and streamline operations. Deckers, the parent company behind On's fellow buzzy footwear brand Hoka, trimmed its sales guidance for Hoka in October. 

Meanwhile, On is raising its sales guidance as it gears up for the holiday shopping season. Retail analysts expect most of the industry to lean heavily on discounts and promotions to drum up demand during the critical holiday shopping season, but On won't even be offering a Black Friday discount, said co-founder and Executive co-Chairman Caspar Coppetti.

On will be "full price through the holiday season," Coppetti said in an interview with CNBC. "This is against the backdrop of a very competitive and very discount-driven environment currently, and so this leveling up that we've done, and then just being able to command a much higher selling price, really sets On apart." 

While On is typically sold alongside brands like Nike, Hoka and Brooks Running, its holiday strategy is similar to those of luxury names. It's part of the company's strategy to be the most premium sportswear brand on the market by not just offering the highest prices but also the most innovative products across footwear and apparel. 

Still far smaller than many of the legacy brands it competes with, On has slowly been chipping away at their market share primarily through innovation, where industry leader Nike has been criticized for falling behind.

Last year, On launched its Cloudboom Strike LS produced with its "LightSpray" technology, which makes performance running shoes using a spray gun in a matter of minutes. Runner Hellen Obiri was wearing the shoes when she broke the women's record in the New York City Marathon by almost three minutes earlier this month.

"That's a very strong validation," said Coppetti. "Runners really do pay attention to what people are wearing now when they're in a race, because these innovations trickle down and they inform their choices."

Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman's expectations for how his employees work at the office are uniquely strict within the company.

Suleyman requires employees to work from the office more than is standard at the company and generally prefers to have open floor plans, a polarizing concept at Microsoft and in engineering in general.

"I very much believe in the in-person working culture," Suleyman told Business Insider. "We've been defragmenting our culture and trying to concentrate."

Microsoft recently announced a new return-to-office mandate requiring most employees to work in an office at least three days a week, starting January 26.

In contrast, Suleyman requires at least four-days-a-week for his employees who live near an office, according to an internal document viewed by Business Insider. Any exceptions must be approved by an executive who reports to Suleyman directly.

Suleyman told Business Insider that he's not a fan of traditional offices with doors that employees can keep closed. In one of his office setups, he has "neighborhoods" with 20 to 30 open desks placed relatively close together, he said.

"Much better for collaboration," Suleyman said. "Everyone can see everyone else who's in. You can feel the buzz, like there's a real intensity about the place, and it just creates a lot more, like informal collaboration. It's so much better."

The AI executive also has a penchant for hanging in Silicon Valley. Suleyman splits his time between Silicon Valley and Seattle, but said most of his team is in Silicon Valley versus Microsoft's Redmond headquarters.

"There's just huge talent density here," he added. "It's the place to be."

Microsoft leaves RTO and office-layout decisions up to individual organizations or teams. The company's Corporate, External, and Legal Affairs team, for example, has been working at least four days a week from the office for about a year.

Other teams working on AI have less strict guidelines. Executive Scott Guthrie's Cloud + AI organization has no org-specific return-to-office guidelines or considerations. Jay Parikh's Core AI group will apply the three-day-a-week guidance for all offices in February, with the exception of GitHub, according to the documents reviewed by Business Insider.

Two European pioneers of the modern wind power industry are sounding the alarm on the Trump administration's clean energy cutbacks, warning Washington's anti-climate agenda is part of a broader energy transition challenge.

Denmark's Henrik Stiesdal and Britain's Andrew Garrad, often referred to as the "Godfathers of wind" for their contributions in advancing the design, manufacture and deployment of wind turbines, said Trump's war on wind appears to be a symptom of more widespread climate apathy.

Stiesdal is known for framing the early design principles for wind turbines and led the installation of the world's first offshore wind farm in 1991, while Garrad developed computer models to optimize and certify turbine and farm designs.

"I think Trump's approach is symptomatic of a general shift," Garrad said, in comments echoed by Stiesdal, one that is opposed to the transition from fossil fuels to renewable technologies, such as wind and solar.

"We are facing right now, a change of mood. We had a very easy beginning, then quite a big struggle, then general acceptance, and now the worm is turning. And that's something which we all have to address," Garrad told CNBC.

Since returning to office at the start of the year, U.S. President Donald Trump has actively sought to disrupt the development of high-profile wind projects. His push to wipe out the offshore wind industry has included stop-work orders and the removal of green incentives under former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.

"Trump is symptomatic. I mean an extreme symptom of that, but you can see it I think in all Western countries certainly, perhaps not elsewhere. And that's a big issue," Garrad said.

"This isn't just a wind energy problem," Garrad said. "To do this sort of change is a very dangerous thing. And I think it has shown that this is a political business ... It's a personal decision by a politician, who happens to be a rather powerful one — and it has sent shockwaves around the place."

Trump's onslaught against the wind industry has hit the business models of renewable energy giants particularly hard. Denmark's Ortsed, the world's biggest offshore wind farm group, is one notable example.

Last week, Orsted reported a net loss of 1.7 billion Danish kroner ($261.8 million) for the July-September period. The result, which was slightly better than analysts feared, was significantly down from profit of 5.17 billion Danish kroner in the same period last year.

Shares of the Copenhagen-listed company, which have fallen more than 80% from a 2021 peak, notched a fresh record low in August after the Trump administration ordered the company to halt work on a near complete windfarm.

Danish wind turbine firm Vestas has also been battling industry uncertainty, in part because of the Trump administration's policies. When asked about some of these challenges, Vestas CEO Henrik Andersen said the company has a "well-established" supply chain in the U.S.

"For us, we see the U.S., both customers and the buildout in the U.S., as some of our core responsibility to help the U.S. with," Andersen told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Nov. 5.

"Then sometimes maybe we have to get a bit of a slap that it is not everyone that likes the nature of a wind turbine. But I think, in general, … energy drives decision making and [the] cost of energy drives decision making," he added.

Trump has repeatedly criticized the deployment of offshore wind turbines, describing them as "pathetic" and "expensive" in a recent speech at the United Nations General Assembly.

"I'm telling you that if you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail," Trump said on Sept. 23. The U.S. president also said climate change is the "greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world."

Scientists have since condemned Trump's characterization of climate change, pointing out that the overwhelming consensus is that climate change is already happening, with record-breaking heatwaves, flood events and hurricanes causing substantial economic damages across the globe.

Stiesdal, who refused to comment specifically on Trump's war on wind, said there appears to be "a fundamental misunderstanding" from those firmly opposed to the energy transition.

"A lot of people who would be inclined to vote for hard-right parties actually benefit both from the job offerings and the cost of their energy from renewables," Stiesdal said.

"It's not an easy thing to fight because a lot of it is kind of visceral or fundamental in the thinking about this tribal approach," he continued. "Whenever I am confronted with that, or with discussions about that, I try to emphasize energy security, the job creation, the local beneficial effects of doing renewables and the assurances you get in society."

Stiesdal and Garrad were speaking to CNBC shortly before being presented with the 2024 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering. The prize was presented by King Charles III during a reception at St. James's Palace in London earlier this month.

Monday - Friday, 10:00 - 11:00 SIN/HK  |  0400 - 05:00 CET

This report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. You can subscribe here.

Cultural shifts are subtle yet fundamental for any company aiming to succeed beyond its home market.

When I visited Chinese electric car company Xpeng's new headquarters in Guangzhou last week, what stood out wasn't just how shiny it was compared to the building I'd visited last year, but the fluency of its global mindset, down to the small details like accurate English translations in signs and presentations. It went beyond the cursory "innovation" banners often seen in China.

Leaders of Xpeng's autonomous driving, robotics and flying car units each delivered 40-minute presentations entirely in English — including their decks — without any translation device. In conversation with reporters, Xpeng founder and CEO He Xiaopeng even declared a ten-year goal to generate half of the company's sales from outside China.

He has reason to be upbeat. Xpeng notched 12 straight months of more than 30,000 deliveries each, and exported a small but growing number of cars: 29,000 in just three quarters. That was more than double what Xpeng shipped from a year earlier.

Xpeng's global ambitions reflect a broader trend across China. In the last year or so, overseas expansion has become a top priority for nearly every Chinese company — an eagerness that Joe Ngai, chairman of McKinsey Greater China, said he's never seen.

"It's astonishing what this phenomenon is," he said, noting that fierce competition in China is driving local companies to seek higher profit margins abroad. But he cautioned it won't be easy, and that local partnerships would be important.

Overseas markets only accounted for 8% of total revenue for the 50 largest Chinese companies as of 2021, according to McKinsey. That is far below 31% in overseas revenue for the largest U.S. companies, the data showed.

I first learned about Xpeng on the sidelines of CNBC's East Tech West conference in 2018, when the Alibaba-backed startup touted its edge in autonomous driving and drew comparisons to Tesla.

But Xpeng wasn't able to release regulator-approved driver-assist systems at scale for a few years yet. Deliveries averaged just over 10,000 a month in 2022, and dipped well below that in early 2023 while rivals surged ahead.

At a small Xpeng event in Shanghai that I attended in March 2023, there were hints that the startup might have the tech — just not the product Chinese consumers wanted. The event speaker, Xinzhou Wu, head of autonomous driving, soon left to lead Nvidia's automotive chip business.

It was also in early 2023 that Xpeng brought in veteran Great Wall Motor executive Fengying Wang as president to oversee product planning and sales. Her leadership, along with the launch of a more affordable Mona M03 car, helped spark the company's turnaround. Wang remains with Xpeng today.

"Of course, it's much better when [the electric car companies have an] English-language interface," said Nick Kolodko, a Shanghai-based auto influencer who has lived in China for over a decade. He noted how some Chinese EV startups in Europe had in-car AI assistants that didn't support local languages.

He's since observed some Chinese automakers granting their overseas teams more control over the last 18 months or so, though he said there's still a gap with European rivals in shaping a compelling brand narrative.

Critically for Xpeng, it secured a $700 million investment from German auto giant Volkswagen in July 2023. The two companies have gradually expanded the partnership to include technological development.

Down the road, "Chinese EV makers can also take a lot of [intellectual property] fees from such [tech] collaboration," said George Chen, managing director and co-chair of digital practice for The Asia Group. "This will be significant because 30, 40 years ago, European carmakers and American carmakers [were] doing exactly the same thing in Chinese markets."

For now, Xpeng is taking the first step beyond exporting cars and local production.

The company opened its first European factory in Austria in August, and plans to produce tens of thousands of cars there next year, according to Brian Gu, co-president of Xpeng. A former JPMorgan executive, Gu has been with Xpeng since its early days and helped the startup build ties with Wall Street ahead of its U.S. and Hong Kong listings.

Xpeng is set to release earnings on Monday. In the first half of 2025, Xpeng claimed to be the best-selling Chinese new-energy vehicle startup brand in Norway, France, Singapore and Israel.

"The whole overseas expansion of Chinese companies will be part of the global business landscape for the next five years," McKinsey's Ngai said, "and I have zero doubts about it."

Weiwen Han, Bain & Co.'s Asia-Pacific retail practice leader, said China's sales "month" could surpass U.S. Cyber Week sales and continue to grow steadily.

Fred Hu, Chairman and CEO of Primavera Capital, said China's economy will be in much better shape once consumer spending normalizes.

Georges Elhedery, CEO of HSBC, discussed the impact of tariffs on global trade and added that China's economic rebalancing is a "welcome development."

China's exports dip. Shipments of Chinese goods fell in October for the first time in more than a year as businesses slowed their ramp-up of orders to pre-empt tariffs.

Uneasy U.S.-China truce. Beijing has formalized agreements to delay restrictions on certain rare-earth exports for a year.

Luckin's second act. Jinyi Guo, CEO of Luckin Coffee, said the company is preparing to relist in the U.S. five years after an accounting scandal. It will face new Chinese IPO rules to do so.

The one thing that was different from Xpeng AI day from its previous tech day, is that it is talking more about its ambition oversea as a brand, not just as a EV maker, because it is pushing out all these other physical AI products beyond just an electric vehicle.

— Kevin Xu, founder and CIO of Interconnected Capital

Chinese stock markets traded mixed following Tuesday's session on Wall Street, where investors sold off technology names and drove a rally in more risk-off parts of the market.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 0.81%, while mainland's CSI 300 lost 0.13%.

The offshore Chinese yuan last traded at 7.1189 against the dollar.

Business Insider Edition 

Chinese automakers are stepping up investment in South Africa, with two leading Chinese carmakers, Beijing Automotive Group (BAIC) and Chery, set to build factories and expand local manufacturing.


Chinese automakers are stepping up investment in South Africa, with Beijing Automotive Group (BAIC) and Chery unveiling plans to expand local manufacturing; a move that underscores Africa's growing role in the global auto industry.
    


        With intense competition in their home market and increasing trade restrictions in Europe and the United States, Chinese carmakers are turning to Africa as a key growth market. 



        South Africa, with its well-established automotive infrastructure and rising consumer demand, has emerged as a prime destination for these strategic investments.
    


        BAIC, alongside BYD and Chery, is among roughly 18 Chinese brands now active in South Africa. The company's Gqeberha plant in the Eastern Cape currently assembles the BAIC B40 Plus and Beijing X55 Plus SUV models.
    


        BAIC South Africa plans to begin assembling its newly launched B30 off-road SUV at the same facility as early as January, according to Chief Financial Officer Anele Geza. 
    


        The move marks a major step toward boosting local production and integrating more deeply into South Africa's manufacturing base.
    


        Speaking at the B30 launch event, Geza said the new B30 combustion engine and hybrid models will be assembled locally using a completely knocked-down (CKD) process, which involves building cars from numerous smaller parts to increase local content.
    


        The company's current models are made using a semi-knocked-down approach, where large, partially assembled components are imported and completed locally.
    


        The expansion aligns with South Africa's Automotive Masterplan 2035, which aims to raise annual vehicle production from about 600,000 to 1.4 million units and boost local content. 
    


Global automakers such as Toyota and Ford, which already operate factories in South Africa, have urged new entrants to commit to local manufacturing to strengthen the industry's long-term viability.
    


        BAIC South Africa CEO Yang Yixin reaffirmed the company's long-term commitment to the country. He said, 
    


        “We will continue to introduce more new models while steadily expanding local production and value creation.”
    


        Meanwhile, another Chinese car giant, Chery, which owns the Omoda and Jaecoo sister brands, is exploring plans to establish a vehicle assembly plant in South Africa, a potential investment that could create jobs and give a major boost to the country's automotive sector.
    


        The company confirmed it is conducting feasibility studies on local production as it seeks to strengthen its presence in a market that has quickly warmed to Chinese vehicles.
    


        “We're currently conducting feasibility studies in South Africa, which remains a key focus for both Omoda and Jaecoo,” the company said. “The country plays an important role in our broader global strategy, and we're carefully assessing opportunities to expand our presence and meet the growing local demand.”
    


        Globally, Chinese automakers have been expanding their manufacturing footprints to diversify production and hedge against trade barriers. Chery said it also plans to bring some of its Chinese suppliers into South Africa to help meet local content requirements.
    


        “We are interested in the long-term investment in South Africa,” the company said.

Former DocuSign CEO Dan Springer graduated from Harvard Business School, but he says holding an Ivy League degree won't help his employees score a promotion during their annual reviews.

"I'll tell you what matters. It matters to me that people did something great," Springer said in an interview with Business Insider.

Springer was the CEO of DocuSign, the electronic signature company, from 2017 to 2022. In April, he left DocuSign's board and joined Ironclad, a contract management software company, as CEO.

Springer graduated with an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1991. He then joined McKinsey and worked at the consulting firm for over six years.

He told Business Insider that while he loved his time at Harvard, he's not that interested in hearing about people's degrees.

"I'd be more interested about: 'What did you do after you got that degree? How did you apply it and how are you growing your stuff?'" he said.

Springer said that when it comes to vetting people for promotions, he looks at three variables: an employee's skills, their ego, and how hard they work.

Those come together for him as a formula.

"Skills, having the skills that you work with, divided by your ego," Springer said. "You don't want to have a big ego. You want to maintain the ego and focus on the company and our customers, and then you raise that to the power of how hard they work."

"It's a lot of work to build a growing software company, and so people have to have that intensity to say, 'I'm going to put in the work.' Once you have the skills and values, in the end, it really comes to, 'Are you working smart and are you working hard?'" he added.

Springer isn't the only business leader who has stressed the importance of dedication.

Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder and CEO of the hedge fund Citadel, told his summer interns in 2022 that people needed to aggressively pitch themselves for bigger roles and responsibilities.

"Don't be shy in asking for bigger problems to take on. Don't be shy about asking for a promotion. What's the worst they're going to say — that you're too ambitious?" Griffin said.

Luis von Ahn, the cofounder and CEO of Duolingo, wrote in a LinkedIn post on September 22 that new hires who wanted to succeed at his company should be proactive at solving problems.

In his post, von Ahn said Duolingo didn't have a company blog, until an engineer took the initiative to start one. Von Ahn said that the engineer "did way better at Duolingo" than his colleague, who only complained about the problem instead of doing something about it.

"If something bothers you, you generally have the freedom here to fix it. We're still figuring lots of things out, and if you see a problem, you can actually do something about it here," von Ahn added.

OpenSea unveils Meetbit, an AI-powered plush toy project merging physical collectibles with blockchain, while preparing Q1 2026 SEA token launch amid FIFA World Cup opportunities.

OpenSea confirmed the launch of its AI Toy Mint, Meetbit, on Wednesday, signaling a bold new chapter for the NFT marketplace as it blends digital collectibles with real-world interaction. The project introduces Viz, an AI-powered plush toy combining adaptive intelligence with blockchain technology.

The Meebits AI Toy Mint is live on @opensea!





Mint your Early Access Pass to claim one of 1,000 Meebits x @CurioBeta Visitor AI-powered plush toys and unlock digital rewards.

— Meebits (@MeebitsNFTs) November 12, 2025



According to the project's website, holders of the Early Access Pass will receive exclusive early access to a limited batch of physical Viz plushies, along with digital Meebits rewards to be revealed later.



The announcement follows the debut of House of Pranksy, a collaborative project with one of crypto's earliest collectors earlier in the week. The marketplace also confirmed its support for Art Basel Miami Beach's Zero 10 initiative, a digital-first platform connecting NFT creators to the global art economy. The event is set to be held in early December 2025.

OpenSea's latest moves come after founder Devin Finzer confirmed expansion plans for 2026, including a native SEA token launch expected as early as Q1.

In an exclusive interview with Coinspeaker, Atleta Network CEO Dima Saksonov discusses Web3 and sport collectibles, offering expert insights into OpenSea's recent decision to launch a native token and plans for the World Cup 2026 hosted in the US and Mexico.

Regarding OpenSea's relevance to sports and collectibles today, Saksonov explains that OpenSea is still a place where many everyday collectors start, and that matters for sport. If they roll out the SEA token effectively, the immediate effect would be more buyers and sellers actually trading and new reasons to bid, list, and refer.

“The impact on direct exchanges between fans and athletes will depend on how quickly SEA rewards plug into partner marketplaces and whether royalties, revenue shares, and ticketed access can be recognized across venues. If OpenSea shares order flow and metadata with sport-specific platforms, you get a portable reputation and better pricing for clubs and creators,” Saksonov stated.

On the opportunities for the crypto fan economy with the 2026 FIFA World Cup hosted in the US and Mexico, Saksonov notes that the tournament spans 48 teams and 104 matches across 16 cities in the US, Canada, and Mexico. FIFA measured five billion people engaged around Qatar 2022 and roughly 1.5 billion for the final.

“For the World Cup cycle, we're prioritizing areas such as simple proof-of-presence and loyalty, transparent micro-funding to clubs and approved academies, and programmable collectibles that unlock access and milestones. We're working with clubs and fostering our own football academies in host markets to pilot these mechanics around friendlies and fan festivals ahead of kickoff, with announcements closer to the event,” Saksonov noted.

Solana SOL$151.70 faces renewed selling pressure as the token tumbles from $160.72 to $152.81, posting a 4.9% decline despite continued institutional support through exchange-traded fund products. The drop occurs on elevated volume running 17.25% above the seven-day average. Active repositioning dominates rather than passive drift.

Selling intensifies following another scheduled token unlock from bankrupt Alameda Research and the FTX estate on November 11. Analyst MartyParty reports approximately 193,000 SOL tokens worth $30 million get released as part of ongoing monthly vesting. The program has been gradually distributing over 8 million tokens since November 2023. These structured releases, managed under bankruptcy oversight, typically flow to major exchanges for creditor repayment.

Institutional demand remains robust with solana spot ETFs recording their tenth consecutive day of inflows totaling $336 million for the week. Major financial institutions including Rothschild Investment and PNC Financial Services disclosed new holdings in Solana-based products. Grayscale introduced options trading for its Solana Trust ETF (GSOL) to provide additional hedging tools for institutional traders.

Alameda's systematic token releases create predictable selling pressure while institutional flows provide underlying support. SOL finds itself caught between opposing forces. The bankruptcy estate maintains approximately 5 million tokens in locked or staked positions. Smaller monthly unlocks continue through 2028 based on pre-2021 investment agreements.

The 60-minute analysis reveals accelerating bearish momentum as SOL breaks critical support at $156 amid explosive selling volume. The breakdown occurs during 15:00-16:00 UTC when price collapses from $155.40 to $152.86 on 212,000 volume—123% above the hourly average. 

This technical failure confirms the earlier support breach and establishes a descending channel targeting the $152.50-$152.80 demand zone. However, underlying strength in ETF flows suggests institutional accumulation at lower levels. Bitwise's BSOL leads weekly inflows with $118 million while maintaining its yield-focused strategy through staking rewards averaging over 7% annually.

Support/Resistance: Primary support establishes at $152.80 demand zone with secondary levels at $150; immediate resistance at $156 (former support) and $160

Volume Analysis: 24-hour volume surges 17% above weekly average during breakdown, confirming institutional repositioning rather than retail capitulation

Chart Patterns: Descending channel formation with lower highs at $156.71 and $156.13; break above $160 needed to invalidate bearish structure

Targets & Risk/Reward: Bounce potential toward $160-$165 resistance if $152.80 holds; breakdown below $150 accelerates toward $145 support levels

CoinDesk 5 Index fell from $1,792.49 to $1,759.24, declining $33.25 (-1.85%) across a $74.31 total range as strong bearish momentum emerges after failing resistance at $1,824.82, with significant institutional volume during the 15:00-16:00 selloff confirming the downward break below key support at $1,767.

Overnight crypto gains once again evaporated by U.S. morning hours as bitcoin BTC$101,691.35 tumbled back below $102,000 on Wednesday.

Briefly topping $105,000 earlier today, the largest crypto nosedived 3% in just a couple hours as U.S. traditional markets opened. It wasn't just bitcoin; ether ETH$3,439.10 fell almost 5% below $3,400 during the same period, while Solana SOL$153.35, XRP$2.3489 and other altcoin majors suffered similar declines.

Crypto-related U.S. stocks are also taking a beating in the early session. USDC stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) dropped 9.5% after its third quarter earnings, while crypto miners with data center ambitions including Bitfarms (BITF), Bitdeer (BTDR), Cipher Mining (CIFR), Hive Digital (HIVE), Hut 8 (HUT) and IREN continued selling off, down 5%-10%.

Lackluster price action during U.S. trading hours has been a staple for the past few weeks now on crypto markets. Showcasing the weak American investor appetite is the so-called Coinbase Premium, a popular gauge for U.S. investor demand, which has been negative since late October.

The Coinbase Premium measures the price difference for spot BTC on Coinbase, widely used crypto exchange by U.S. customers and many institutional market participants, compared to prices on Binance, the leading exchange by trading volume that's popular among offshore retail users.

That's the metric's longest negative streak since March-April, when BTC fell to $75,000 from above $100,000 in a market-wide correction.

The shift in U.S. sentiment coincides with growing uncertainty around the Federal Reserve's next move since the central bank's October meeting. What had been widely assumed before the meeting to be a straightforward path to another rate cut in December, has now turned into an internal battle among policymakers.

According to a recent Wall Street Journal report, the central bank is facing an internal divide, with policymakers split over whether the greater risk now is persistent inflation or a softening labor market. That division has left the path to a December rate cut far less clear than it appeared just weeks ago.

The recent government shutdown, which temporarily froze key employment and inflation data releases, has only widened that divide by forcing policymakers to lean on private data and anecdotes, the report said.

A December cut is now a "tossup," the report said, and even deciding on lowering rates could come with guidance of higher bar for further reductions.

Since the Fed's October meeting, U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs saw more than $1.8 billion in net outflows, pointing to that uncertainty around the Fed's move, and the lack of clear positive catalysts, is keeping BTC on edge.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are struggling to stay above support zones after another wave of selling hit the market. The bullish energy that drove prices higher earlier this month is fading, and the clock is ticking for a strong recovery.

Bitcoin recently faced rejection near $104,000 and slid back toward $102,000. A close below that level could open the door for another move down toward $98,000. That range has acted as support several times, but repeated retests often make it fragile.

Bitcoin Faces “Make or Break” Moment

Price action on the daily chart shows a steady pattern of lower highs and lower lows, a sign of a continuing downtrend. Unless Bitcoin pushes back above $104,000–$106,000 soon, the next stop may be below the $100,000 line.

The current setup hints at a possible “death cross” — a point where short-term moving averages slide under long-term ones. Such formations often pull prices lower before any recovery attempt begins.

A brief bounce remains possible if the $98,000 support holds. Reclaiming lost ground above $104,000 would bring fresh hope of a rebound later in the month, but momentum needs to return fast.

Ethereum Struggles to Regain Strength

Ethereum is showing similar weakness. After a short recovery from around $3,000, the coin is again losing ground below resistance near $3,700. A strong daily close above that level could mark the first step toward recovery, but for now, the market remains cautious.

If selling continues, Ethereum may revisit the $2,800 zone, which has acted as a mid-range floor several times this year. The coin remains caught in a tight range with limited buying volume.

Altcoins Stay Mixed as Caution Grows

Some smaller altcoins are holding steady or showing minor rebounds, but the overall market tone remains soft. A few tokens have tried to push higher, yet none have sparked enough interest to change the broader direction.

Most digital assets are simply moving sideways while waiting for a clear shift in momentum from the top two cryptocurrencies.

Outlook for the Coming Days

The next few days could decide whether Bitcoin and Ethereum hold their ground or continue sliding lower. Strong buying near current support zones would bring some relief, but a break below could trigger another correction phase.

Price stability above $104,000 for Bitcoin and $3,700 for Ethereum remains the focus this week. If that happens, the market could regain strength heading into the second half of November.

The Brazilian government proposed a law to allow the sale of bitcoin BTC$101,341.64 and other cryptocurrencies seized during criminal investigations at a time when the nation appears to be cracking down on organized crime.

Bill 5.582/2025, sent to Congress by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, would authorize financial institutions to liquidate cryptocurrencies even before trial outcomes, just as foreign currencies, checks and securities are treated. What happens if suspects are later acquitted isn't clear.

Officials said the measure is intended to hit gangs where it hurts: their wallets, and is part of a broader "anti-faction bill" that amends legislation on criminal organizations and Brazil's code of criminal procedure. It is aimed at the financial infrastructure of gangs like Comando Vermelho, one of the country's most powerful criminal factions, 

The timing of the proposal is notable. It comes days after a major police operation in Rio's favelas left 121 people dead, most of them alleged gang members, in what is now the country's deadliest police raid.

Authorities said the raid targeted leaders of Comando Vermelho and involved more than 2,500 officers.

The push to liquidate seized crypto assets is unfolding alongside a major regulatory overhaul by Brazil's central bank. The central bank released new rules requiring crypto companies to be licensed and to hold capital reserves ranging from 10.8 million ($2 million) to 37.2 million reais, depending on their activities.

The rules, which take effect in February, classify a wide range of crypto activities under Brazil's foreign exchange and capital markets laws.

They require firms to report international transactions, including stablecoin payments and transfers to self-custody wallets, and place a $100,000 cap on each transaction involving foreign exchange.

The anti-faction bill is under urgent consideration in Congress and must be voted on by Dec. 18.

U.S. government agencies are cranking up the response to overseas scams that seek to trick people into sending crypto, with the Department of the Treasury announcing a Scam Center Strike Force on Wednesday even as it flagged its latest effort to target a Burmese operation that pursued Americans with fake investment schemes.



U.S. authorities, also including the Department of Justice, are standing up the strike force to go after so-called "pig butchering" often coordinated by massive organized-crime operations in places such as Burma, Cambodia, Laos and the Philippines. The newest case involved Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioning armed groups, companies and individuals in Burma associated with the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army and scam centers said to be backed by Chinese criminal organizations.



The strike force, led by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, aims to take apart the transnational criminal enterprises in Southeast Asia that have stolen tens of billions from Americans — much of it going unreported. The practice sees teams of operatives — often forced into it via human trafficking — working at a factory scale to trick people into fraudulent investing or into sending funds to fake romantic partners.



"The Administration will keep using every tool we have to go after these cybercriminals — wherever they operate — and to protect American families from their exploitation," said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John Hurley, in a statement.



The strike force envisions tapping various parts of the federal government with oversight duties related to this area, including DOJ, the Treasury Department, the State Department and domestic law enforcement agencies.



"The scale is staggering," said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs for TRM labs, of the global criminal enterprises involved in pig butchering. "The DOJ's Scam Center Strike Force reflects a hard truth: no single agency can tackle this alone."



In a similar vein, the DOJ has previously established a health care strike force and a trade-fraud task force.



Last month, U.S. authorities went after Prince Group, which was alleged to have run a Cambodia operation, with the DOJ taking what it said was its largest-ever seizure of 127,271 bitcoin BTC$101,696.11. The action was coordinated between the DOJ and the Treasury.



In Burma, the development of the scam centers was tied by the U.S. authorities to others among the sanctioned entities, including Trans Asia International Holding Group Thailand Company Ltd. (Trans Asia), Troth Star Co. Ltd. (Troth Star) and Thai national Chamu Sawang. The sanctions accused them of being linked to Chinese organized crime, and authorities said the proceeds are going toward funding Burma's civil war.

Oops, something went wrong

If you've attended any finance panels recently or glanced at the latest fund launches, you've probably heard about tokenisation, as it's everywhere these days. And with good reason: more than $34 billion in real-world assets have already moved on-chain, from tokenised US Treasuries to “digital gold” and even real estate. All of which makes it easy to believe that finance has finally reached its programmable, borderless future.

But look closer, and the reality proves more intricate. According to recent research, most tokenised assets barely trade — BUIDL, the largest RWA token by market capitalisation, has only 85 holders, 30 active wallets, and 104 monthly transfers. Liquidity is thin, market-makers remain on the sidelines, and the legal part, from wrappers to cross-border settlement, is still incomplete.

So why aren't RWAs working yet? Let's try to figure it out.

For all its excitement, the RWA market remains trapped between promise and proof. And if I had to name the first thing that comes to mind when asked what's holding tokenisation back, it'd be liquidity.

Most tokenised assets, whether Treasuries, funds, or private credit, hardly trade once issued, a reality confirmed by research revealing that “RWA tokens exhibit low trading volumes, long holding periods, and limited investor participation.” That meagre activity widens spreads, clouds valuations, and discourages market-makers who lack the depth to commit capital. The result is a market that looks liquid on paper but behaves like a closed loop — attractive to issue, difficult to exit.

Even if liquidity forms, regulation is the next bottleneck. When rules are consistent, markets follow; when they aren't, progress stalls, and, so far, tokenisation falls into the latter. Every jurisdiction defines digital securities differently: MiCA in Europe, the DSS in the UK, Project Guardian in Singapore, and case law in the US. That means each project demands bespoke legal work and compliance mapping — a reminder that geography still decides what tokenisation can and cannot be.

The infrastructure needs to be ready, too. Yet custody, settlement, and valuation systems remain fragmented, with most pilots still running outside core banking rails. As a recent market report observed, without trusted oracles and interoperable standards, tokenisation cannot yet deliver its full promise of instant settlement and collateral efficiency. This keeps institutions from treating tokens as balance-sheet assets or eligible collateral, preventing the market from scaling in any meaningful way.

So, each of these gaps shows that tokenisation may not be short on ambition, but it's certainly short on foundations. The real question now is how to lay them quickly enough for the market to stand on its own.

If tokenisation is to move from promise to practice, it needs firmer ground beneath, and in practice, that ground is credible, functioning secondary markets.

Such dedicated secondary venues as MAS's Project Guardian liquidity pools or the UK's Digital Securities Sandbox clearly prove that when issuers, custodians, and market-makers operate on shared standards, depth follows. Liquidity incentives, transparent pricing feeds, and interoperable disclosure rules could replicate that at scale, which could finally make on-chain assets investable, not just issuable.

Just as quickly, legal certainty must evolve, because a token that cannot prove title or settle under recognised custody rules will always sit at the periphery of finance. I think the solution to the current patchwork lies in standardised wrappers and mutual recognition across jurisdictions. That would finally let institutions treat tokenised assets as balance-sheet eligible, paving the way for global issuance and usability.

Eventually, unified-ledger prototypes, tokenised collateral networks introduced by leading global banks, and other market-grade experiments point to a future where custody, pricing, and settlement move on the same rails. So, interoperability is no longer a nice-to-have — it's a prerequisite. Once those rails are trusted and connected, capital may circulate through tokenised markets as efficiently as code.

If layers converge, tokenisation would go beyond the experiment and become the backbone of modern market architecture. But if they don't, it risks ending where NFTs did: with innovation outpacing adoption and a cycle of hype that never quite turns into habit. The industry still has time to decide which story it wants to write — but not much.

The best online casinos gain status through transparency and trustworthiness, calming the fears of prospective players. Online casinos that allow wagers with cryptocurrency face numerous similar challenges in comparison to apps and sites that offer online casino games for real money. Many of the fears relate to players' skepticism about cryptocurrency and a lack of information about how to identify a legitimate crypto casino.

Fear of the unknown can be strong. For many individuals, doubts regarding crypto casinos simply stem from a lack of experience and knowledge.

Those concerns can amplify when considering not only cryptocurrency itself but then adding in the gaming element. It's understandable to consider questions like whether you will actually collect your winnings if you get lucky playing on the casino site, for example.

However, many people voice similar concerns about licensed online casinos in the U.S. like Golden Nugget Casino. Although Golden Nugget and the ilk restrict currency usage to U.S. dollars, some people still hesitate to take advantage of the Golden Nugget Online Casino promo code due to security doubts. 

If doubts are steeped in a lack of information, then the upside is that information can quell those fears. Regarding crypto casinos, knowledge is power.

Click here to claim the Golden Nugget Casino promo code offer for new players:

If you hold cryptocurrency, it's natural to see a casino welcome bonus and be curious. These offers are also how legal sites like the BetMGM Casino app attract new players.

A first positive sign is the types of cryptocurrency accepted for play. If the site deals in Bitcoin and Ethereum, for example, you're on the right track.

A second consideration is the clarity and thoroughness of the casino site's policies for managing your crypto wallet. A lack of information or vague information in this regard is a red flag.

One of the most important points of evaluation is the casino's use of blockchain technology to provide transparency to game play. If you can't verify that, you're better off looking elsewhere to play.

Even if the website checks all these boxes, there is still risk involved any time you play casino games. In some ways, that risk elevates when you involve cryptocurrency.

Get your BetMGM Casino bonus code for new users now:

The value of your cryptocurrency can be highly volatile and a comparative lack of regulation compared to online casinos that run on US dollars means you are to some degree playing at your own risk without a high level of recourse to seek remedies from potential harms. The more research you do, the better suited you will be to avoid potential calamity.

Oops, something went wrong

A Russian policymaker is calling on the Federal Assembly to regulate cryptocurrencies as a third of web traffic going into international crypto exchanges is seen to originate from Russia.

Yevgeny Masharov, a member of the Civic Chamber of the Commission for Public Review of Bills and Other Regulatory Acts, told RIA Novosti that the state must do more to police digital assets.

“We must launch legislation to regulate cryptocurrency circulation as soon as possible,” Masharov said. “All transactions outside [licensed platforms] need to be outlawed. We must introduce criminal liability for illegal cryptocurrency transactions.”

His call for stronger regulation comes as a combination of factors has driven Russians to adopt crypto.

“The combination of a weakening ruble, capital controls, and international sanctions has accelerated adoption,” Ari Redbord, the vice president and global head of policy and government affairs at the blockchain intelligence provider TRM Labs, told DL News. “This is both for legitimate financial access and, in some cases, for sanctions evasion.”

Redbord added that TRM's data “shows that the vast majority of Russian crypto activity remains lawful,” and that the increase reflects a broader global trend where more people are turning to digital assets due to “necessity, innovation, and financial pressure.”

Crypto is a thorny political issue in Russia.

As things stand, crypto exchanges are completely unregulated in Russia. The Central Bank has previously called for a complete, China-style ban on crypto trading.

But the Ministry of Finance would prefer to regulate the industry and force traders to pay tax on their profits. This has led to a lengthy stand-off.

Masharov said that crypto trading in Russia must now be restricted to regulated financial bodies, such as the Moscow Exchange and the country's largest banks.

Policymakers are concerned that the Telegram chat app, which is widely used in Russia, offers its users access to crypto wallet services.

This, Masharov said, allows all Russian citizens “to buy, sell, and invest digital currency directly from the app.”

And that removes these citizens' financial activities from the scrutiny of the country's regulators and anti-money laundering bodies, he warned.

Russian IP addresses accounted for up to 28% of traffic to the crypto exchange Bybit in October, according to data from the AI-powered digital intelligence provider Similarweb.

Bybit saw 17.5 million visits last month, 4.9 million of which originated from Russia, according to the data.

Russians also accounted for 16% of traffic to the HTX platform and 5% of Gate visitors. In total, at least 6 million Russians visited these overseas exchanges in October, RBC wrote.

Meanwhile, a survey from the financial marketplace operator Vyberu found that 10% of Russians want to invest in crypto, Russian media outlet Finansy reported.

Over a third of this group said they thought crypto could grant them “independence from the banking system or political risk.” And 30% said that the ability to trade crypto at any time, from anywhere in the world, drew them to coins.

But despite their confidence, only 3% to 5% of the survey's 2,500 respondents admitted to owning crypto.

Ethereum's native token, Ether ETHUSD, is “seconds away” from entering a convincing breakout stage, according to analyst Kamran Asghar.

Key takeaways:

Ethereum is nearing a breakout from a falling wedge, with a target of $4,400.

A bullish crossover in Ethe's MACD indicator supports the short-term upside outlook.

ETH price may rise above $4,400 by mid-December

As of Wednesday, ETH painted a textbook falling wedge structure while its Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator signaled a bull cross. 

The falling wedge typically suggests that bearish momentum is fading. In Ether's case, the structure has been developing since early October and is now approaching a breakout point near $3,560, which also aligns with the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level.

A decisive move above this resistance could confirm a breakout, setting the stage for a rally toward $4,415 by mid-December, which is roughly 25% higher than current levels. 

The target corresponds to the 0.786 Fib level, which previously acted as a key resistance zone.

Adding weight to the bullish outlook, Asghar highlighted that Ethereum's MACD, a momentum indicator, is “seconds away” from completing a bullish crossover.

The MACD compares two moving averages to detect shifts in trend strength. When the faster blue line crosses above the slower orange line, it suggests that buying pressure is overtaking selling momentum.

Historically, similar MACD flips during consolidation phases have preceded both short-term and long-term rallies for ETH.

What could change the bullish view?

A pullback from the wedge's upper trendline, however, risks invalidating the breakout setup, instead pushing ETH's price toward the lower trendline, which is around the $3,000-3,200 range.

In the worst-case scenario, the price may consolidate until it reaches the apex of the wedge, where its two trendlines converge, at around $2,710.

Ethereum's MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands indicate a downside outlook, suggesting that ETH may slip toward its –0.5σ band (teal) at around $2,870 after closing below its mean valuation level.

Throughout Ether's history, similar breakdowns below the mean band have preceded extended sell-offs, often pushing ETH's price to or below the teal– 0.5σ band before a recovery began.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) plans to operationalize its Singapore Dollar wholesale CBDC testnet this week to support live tokenization trials. The move will provide infrastructure for cross border settlement and tokenization transactions.

MAS is adopting a hybrid approach, providing both a wholesale CBDC and an interoperability solution to interface with other DLT networks. 

The announcement came during a Layer One Summit speech by MAS Deputy Managing Director Leong Sing Chiong, in which he discussed several tokenization initiatives. However, he rated overall tokenization progress as “mixed, uneven and patchy” both across markets and within industries.

“Trusted, open and interoperable networks will not emerge by chance. Hard work and heavy lifting are required,” he said. Singapore has been advancing this work through Project Guardian pilots and its Global Layer One initiative, which aims to develop tokenization standards and an ecosystem.

Key Takeaways

Around the world, central banks are accelerating efforts to issue their own digital currencies, known as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), to modernize financial systems and reduce reliance on private cryptocurrencies and cash.

As of November 2025, 137 countries and currency unions, representing nearly the entire global economy, are actively exploring CBDCs.

Yet, only a handful have successfully launched fully operational systems.

This week, the United Arab Emirates became the latest nation to take a major step forward, launching a pilot of its Digital Dirham, signaling its ambitions to join the small but growing list of countries experimenting with government-backed digital currencies.

CBDCs are a digital form of a nation's fiat currency, issued and regulated by its central bank.

Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), CBDCs are centralized and fully backed by the issuing authority.

The primary goals of CBDCs vary by country — from improving cross-border payment efficiency to expanding financial inclusion and reducing the costs of handling cash.

Some also see CBDCs as tools for strengthening monetary sovereignty in an increasingly digital financial landscape.

CBDCs typically come in two forms:

The United Arab Emirates officially launched its Digital Dirham pilot  on Nov. 11, 2025, executing the country's first blockchain-based transaction through the central bank.

The Digital Dirham is a retail CBDC pegged 1:1 to the UAE dirham (AED), built to support faster, cheaper, and more secure financial transactions.

The pilot is being developed using mBridge, a multi-CBDC cross-border platform co-developed by the central banks of the UAE, China, Hong Kong, and Thailand.

According to the UAE Central Bank, the Digital Dirham will be gradually expanded into peer-to-peer, commercial, and cross-border use cases throughout 2026, with a full launch targeted for late 2026.

Officials have said the CBDC will help reduce remittance costs, a key economic driver in the Gulf, while improving transparency, security, and interoperability with other digital payment systems.

Despite the global rush, only four countries have successfully launched CBDCs with full retail functionality:

The Sand Dollar is the world's first retail CBDC, issued by the Central Bank of The Bahamas as a 1:1 digital representation of the Bahamian dollar (BSD), which is pegged to the U.S. dollar.

Its launch was driven by the Bahamas' high cash-handling costs and frequent hurricane disruptions to physical currency distribution.

By mid-2025, over 200,000 wallets will have been created in a population of 400,000 — yet circulation remains below 1% of the total currency issued.

The eNaira is Africa's first retail central bank digital currency, launched by the Central Bank of Nigeria as a 1:1 digital version of the Naira and built on the Hyperledger Besu blockchain.

Designed to expand access to financial services, the eNaira targets the country's large unbanked population, nearly 40% of adults, while addressing the high costs of remittances and restrictions on crypto use.

Users can access the eNaira through wallet apps that support peer-to-peer and merchant payments, offline transactions, and even smart contract-based remittance tools.

By October 2024, the eNaira had recorded more than 13 million wallets, a twelvefold increase since Nigeria's 2022 cash shortage, with ₦18.32 billion in transactions over the first ten months of the year.

Still, despite its impressive reach on paper, 98.5% of wallets were inactive on a weekly basis, according to the IMF.

Launched in 2022, JAM-DEX, short for Jamaica Digital Exchange, is the country's retail CBDC issued by the Bank of Jamaica.

It's pegged 1:1 to the Jamaican dollar (JMD) and operates on a centralized ledger.

The CBDC was introduced to modernize Jamaica's cash-heavy economy, where nearly 28% of adults remain unbanked.

It looks to make payments faster, cheaper, and more inclusive for everyday users and small merchants.

By March 2025, JAM-DEX circulation had reached J$258 million, with 230 million units minted since its launch.

Yet despite steady issuance, usage has remained modest — as of July 2024, only 257 million units were active, reflecting the broader challenge of driving CBDC adoption in a market still heavily reliant on cash.

ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, is the country's retail CBDC issued by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.

The token is backed by a basket of assets, including 40% gold reserves and U.S. dollars, making it one of the few hybrid-backed CBDCs in circulation.

Introduced in 2024, ZiG was designed to stabilize Zimbabwe's volatile currency system and restore confidence after years of inflation and currency devaluation.

By February 2025, ZiG accounted for 43% of formal-sector transactions, up from 26% at launch, and processed the equivalent of $480 million in pilot procurement activity.

However, challenges remain.

The informal economy, which dominates daily trade, still prefers the U.S. dollar, as ZiG has lost 94% of its value since launch, highlighting the difficulty of building trust in a digital currency amid persistent macroeconomic instability.

A further 49 countries are currently piloting CBDCs, testing everything from cross-border trade settlements to retail payments.

Among the most notable active pilots are:

Beyond these headline pilots, a diverse range of countries is conducting their own CBDC experiments.

Indonesia, Kazakhstan, the Philippines, and Russia are testing digital currencies for regional remittances and public-sector payments, while Sweden's e-Krona continues to explore how digital money could coexist with cash in advanced economies.

In Turkey, the Digital Lira is in limited testing across government procurement, and the United Arab Emirates' Digital Dirham pilot has already executed its first successful transaction.

Beyond active pilots, 72 countries are in the early or mid-stage of CBDC development.

These nations — including the U.K., Japan, Malaysia, Kenya, and Iran — are researching technological models, regulatory frameworks, and economic implications.

The United States remains the biggest outlier. Political opposition and privacy concerns have stalled the digital dollar initiative, even as the private stablecoin market flourishes.

Meanwhile, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan are pushing forward with digital currency experiments focusing on tokenized deposits and wholesale systems rather than fully public CBDCs.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) has launched a new deposit token called “JPM Coin” for its institutional clients. The move marks another step in the bank's push into digital assets and blockchain payments.





JPM Coin represents U.S. dollar deposits held at JPMorgan and lets users send and receive money through a public blockchain within seconds, rather than waiting several days for traditional transfers. The service currently operates on Coinbase's (COIN) Base blockchain, according to Naveen Mallela, global co-head of the bank's blockchain arm, Kinexys.

The bank said the rollout followed a successful trial with Mastercard (MA), Coinbase, and B2C2. It plans to offer the service to more clients and expand to other currencies and blockchains once regulators give approval.

Deposit tokens are digital versions of bank deposits that move on blockchain networks. Unlike stablecoins, which are issued by private firms and backed by assets like bonds, deposit tokens are backed by money already held in the bank.

Mallela said deposit tokens may appeal more to large institutions because they can earn interest, which stablecoin holders do not receive. JPM Coin will also be accepted as collateral on Coinbase (COIN), adding to its usefulness for digital finance firms.

JPMorgan is moving ahead of other major banks in using blockchain for payments. Its Kinexys network already handles billions in transactions daily, and the new JPM Coin could help meet growing demand for faster, round-the-clock transfers.

With JPM Coin, JPMorgan is strengthening its lead in digital finance, showing how traditional banks are moving closer to real-time, blockchain-based payments.

Currently, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on JPMorgan stock based on 11 Buys and six Holds. The average JPM stock price target of $340.29 indicates 7.82% upside potential from current levels.

The Bitcoin dominance has remained quite high over the last year, holding firmly above 50% and preventing altcoins from making any meaningful recovery. Even now, the dominance has climbed close to 60%, showing that Bitcoin is still determining the direction of the entire market. However, there has been a development that could change the trajectory of the Bitcoin dominance and put altcoins in the spotlight once again, highlighted by crypto analyst Unichartz.

Bitcoin Dominance Breaks Below 50 EMA

Since 2023, the Bitcoin dominance has remained firmly above the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), showing immense strength around this level. Even through market crashes, the digital asset has maintained its dominance, and with each passing year, the trendline has continued to rise. As long as the Bitcoin dominance stayed above the 50 EMA, it showed it would continue to dominate, but this is changing now.

According to the post by Unichartz, it shows that the Bitcoin dominance has now crashed below the 50-Day EMA for the first time in almost one year. This comes as the dominance lost its footing above 60% and has failed to reclaim its position above it.

Naturally, there has been an attempt to reclaim the 50-Day EMA once again. However, this attempt failed after the brief surge above 63% in early October was thwarted by the market-wide crash on October 10. Since then, the dominance has remained below the 50 EMA and has now spent a full consecutive month below this critical level.

What This Means For The Crypto Market

Historically, the altcoin season has only begun when the Bitcoin dominance has seen a decline. This trend has held strong through the years, and even through the current cycle, has prevented the rise of another altcoin season.

However, with the crash below the 50 EMA, the analyst predicts that the Bitcoin dominance is about to see a massive crash. It shows that the dominance will fall below 40% if it fails to reclaim the 50 EMA soon. Such a crash would give room for altcoins to actually run as the focus moves away from Bitcoin.

With the Altcoin Season Index sitting at a low 31 at the time of this writing, it shows that a crash in the Bitcoin dominance is sorely needed for altcoins to rise again. However, the analyst explains that if the dominance does reclaim the 50 EMA, then Bitcoin's lead may be extended for longer before attention rotates back to altcoin.

            A Chinese woman who was found with 5 billion pounds ($6.6 billion) in Bitcoin after defrauding more than 128,000 people in China in a Ponzi scheme was sentenced by a UK court on Tuesday to over 11 years in prison.
    


            Police said the investigation into Zhimin Qian, 47, led to officers recovering devices holding 61,000 Bitcoin in the largest cryptocurrency seizure in the UK.
    


            Qian, dubbed “cryptoqueen” by British media, was arrested in April 2024 after spending years evading the authorities and living an “extravagant” lifestyle in Europe, staying in luxury hotels across the continent and buying fine jewelry and watches, prosecutors said.
    


            Police said she ran a pyramid scheme that lured more than 128,000 people to invest in her business between 2014 and 2017, including many who invested their life savings and pensions. Authorities said she stored the illegally obtained funds in Bitcoin assets.
    


            When she attracted the attention of Chinese authorities, Qian fled to the UK under a fake identity. Once in London, police said she rented a “lavish” house for over 17,000 pounds ($23,000) per month, and tried but failed to buy multimillion pound properties in a bid to convert the Bitcoin.
    


            Investigators found notes Qian had written documenting her aspirations — including her “intention to become the monarch of Liberland, a self-proclaimed country consisting of a strip of land between Croatia and Serbia.”

            They said other notes showed Qian detailing her hopes of “meeting a duke and royalty.”
    


            Judge Sally-Ann Hales said Qian was the architect of the crimes from start to finish.
    


            “Your motive was one of pure greed. You left China without a thought for the people whose investments you had stolen and enjoyed for a period of time a lavish lifestyle. You lied and schemed, all the while seeking to benefit yourself,” Hales said.
    


            The businesswoman, who had pleaded guilty to money laundering offenses and transferring and possessing criminal property, was sentenced Tuesday to 11 years and eight months at Southwark Crown Court.
    


            She was sentenced alongside her accomplice Seng Hok Ling, 47, a Malaysian national who was accused of helping Qian transfer and launder the cryptocurrency. Ling was jailed at the same court for four years and 11 months after he pleaded guilty to one count of transferring criminal property.

A long-standing goal of artificial intelligence is to build systems capable of complex reasoning in vast domains, a task epitomized by mathematics with its boundless concepts and demand for rigorous proof. Recent AI systems, often reliant on human data, typically lack the formal verification necessary to guarantee correctness. By contrast, formal languages such as Lean1 offer an interactive environment that grounds reasoning, and reinforcement learning (RL) provides a mechanism for learning in such environments. We present AlphaProof, an AlphaZero-inspired2 agent that learns to find formal proofs through RL by training on millions of auto-formalized problems. For the most difficult problems, it uses Test-Time RL, a method of generating and learning from millions of related problem variants at inference time to enable deep, problem-specific adaptation. AlphaProof substantially improves state-of-the-art results on historical mathematics competition problems. At the 2024 IMO competition, our AI system, with AlphaProof as its core reasoning engine, solved three out of the five non-geometry problems, including the competition's most difficult problem. Combined with AlphaGeometry 23, this performance, achieved with multi-day computation, resulted in reaching a score equivalent to that of a silver medallist, marking the first time an AI system achieved any medal-level performance. Our work demonstrates that learning at scale from grounded experience produces agents with complex mathematical reasoning strategies, paving the way for a reliable AI tool in complex mathematical problem-solving.

The challenges associated with the transition of life from water to land are profound1, yet they have been met in many distinct animal lineages2,3,4,5. These constitute a series of independent evolutionary experiments from which we can decipher the role of contingency versus convergence in the adaptation of animal genomes. Here we compare 154 genomes from 21 animal phyla and their outgroups to reconstruct the protein-coding content of the ancestral genomes linked to 11 animal terrestrialization events, and to produce a timescale of terrestrialization. We uncover distinct patterns of gene gain and loss underlying each transition to land, but similar biological functions emerged recurrently pointing to specific adaptations as key to life on land. We show that semi-terrestrial species evolved convergent functional patterns, in contrast with fully terrestrial lineages that followed different paths to land. Our timeline supports three temporal windows of land colonization by animals during the last 487 million years, each associated with specific ecological contexts. Although each lineage exhibits distinct adaptations, there is strong evidence of convergent genome evolution across the animal kingdom suggesting that, in large part, adaptation to life on land is predictable, linking genes to ecosystems.

The colonization of land by life is one of the most notable transitions in the history of Earth, substantially shaping modern ecosystems, life forms and the planet itself1. Terrestrialization has occurred multiple times independently within the animal kingdom, including among arthropods5, vertebrates4, rotifers2, molluscs6, annelids2, nematodes2, tardigrades7 and onychophorans3. Nevertheless, each of these natural experiments in terrestrialization had to overcome similar physiological and environmental challenges2. Phenotypic adaptations—such as water-retentive skin or cuticle2, adapted immune systems8, changes in skeletal design and locomotion2, elevated metabolic rates9, developmental adaptations (such as encapsulated larvae and brooding) and adaptation of vision in aerial environments10—show widespread convergence across terrestrial lineages, suggesting largely predictable responses to similar environmental pressures. At the genotype level, recent studies have shown that genomic changes, including gene innovation11, duplication12 and loss13, were crucial to major metazoan evolutionary transitions. Furthermore, specific genes (for example, aquaporin-coding genes) have been linked to terrestrialization in several clades14, and genomic changes have been associated with individual lineages15,16,17,18; these support the roles of genes related to metabolism, stress response, osmoregulation and immunity in terrestrialization. However, in comparison to land plants19, the genomic basis of terrestrialization across animal lineages remains largely uncharacterized. These parallel natural experiments provide a unique opportunity to determine whether terrestrialization has led to lineage-specific contingent genomic adaptations or whether these are predictable changes in response to the same environmental challenges.

Here we apply a comparative genomics pipeline to a dataset of 154 genomes to explore the role of convergence and contingency in the evolutionary response of animal genomes to the process of terrestrialization, and to establish the timeline of acclimatization of animals to land. Our results reveal that independent terrestrial events were driven by the emergence of similar biological functions, although semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial lineages exhibit different patterns of genomic adaptation to terrestrialization. We identify three temporal windows in which animals colonized land, offering a new chronological framework for these transitions.

We designed an approach that we named intersection framework for convergent evolution (InterEvo), which identifies the intersection of biological functions between different sets of genes that were independently gained or reduced in different nodes along the phylogeny (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Methods). In brief, we mined 154 genomes—151 from 21 animal phyla and 3 from non-animal holozoans (Fig. 1, Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1)—and filtered them by completeness. These represent the diversity of animals and our sampling focuses on species flanking nodes that represent terrestrialization events. In this dataset, we identified 11 such events20 (Fig. 1): node 1 bdelloid rotifers, node 2 clitellate annelids, node 3 Stylommatophora (land gastropods), node 4 nematodes (roundworms), node 5 tardigrades (water bears), node 6 onychophorans (velvet worms), node 7 arachnids, node 8 myriapods (centipedes and millipedes), node 9 Armadillidium (woodlice), node 10 Hexapoda (insects and allies) and node 11 tetrapods (land vertebrates). For Onychophora, Tardigrada and Malacostraca (Armadillidium), only one or two genomes were available at the time of starting these analyses.

The phylogeny is based on 154 sampled taxa, with taxon sampling numbers shown after clade names in parentheses. Terrestrial events are highlighted in green text. HG content of terrestrial nodes is displayed in each corresponding box (from left to right, top to bottom: novel HGs, novel core HGs, expanded HGs, contracted HGs and lost HGs). Branch lengths are scaled to evolutionary time, with divergence times and 95% highest posterior density intervals indicated for terrestrial nodes. Organism silhouettes (sourced from phylopic.org and the authors, released under public domain dedication (CC0 1.0 Universal)) represent the 11 terrestrial events. Geological time abbreviations are as follows: Neop., Neoproterozoic (part); Camb., Cambrian; Ord., Ordovician; Sil., Silurian; Dev., Devonian; Carb., Carboniferous; Perm., Permian; Tri., Triassic; Palg., Paleogene; Ng., Neogene; Q., Quaternary. Myr, million years.

The 3,934,362 protein sequences from these genomes were clustered into 483,458 homology groups (HGs), groups of proteins that have distinctly diverged from other groups, comprising orthologues and/or paralogues21. Using a previously described approach11,13,19, we reconstructed the HG content for the key nodes in the tree and classified the HGs based on their mode of evolution: gene gains (novel, novel core and expanded) and gene reductions (contracted and lost). Novel HGs are those that are present in the ingroup and absent in all the outgroups, with core HGs being present in all the species of the ingroup (permitting one absence). Lost HGs are those that are absent in the ingroup but present in the sister groups and other species in outgroup. Finally, we used CAFE522 to infer expanded or contracted HGs, which are those presenting an increase or reduction, respectively, in the number of gene copies (more detailed definitions are provided in Methods and Supplementary Table 2).

Terrestrialization nodes are characterized by a large turnover of gene gains and reductions (Fig. 2). All terrestrial lineages display large gene gains (novel genes and expansions) compared to their immediate ancestors, except arachnids, hexapods and the novel genes in myriapods. Novelty is much higher in bdelloid rotifers, nematodes, tetrapods and land gastropods, the latter only in gene expansions, a finding supported by a previous study15. Similarly, terrestrial gene reduction (losses and contractions) is pervasive except in arachnids and hexapods; there is no increase in gene loss in land gastropods, tetrapods and bdelloid rotifers, the latter probably due to the massive losses in the last common ancestor (LCA) of the sampled rotiferans. Nematoda, Tardigrada and Onychophora show the largest gene losses, in agreement with previous studies12,13, together with Rotifera. Although sparse taxon sampling and the fast-evolving nature of some lineages can inflate gene turnover estimates13,23, the pattern persists after normalization by divergence time, measured as the accumulation of novel and novel core HGs per million years (Supplementary Table 3). Expansion and contraction need no correction as the birth–death model is intrinsically scaled by branch length. For the significance of gene turnover, a permutation test confirmed that the observed novel gene rates found in terrestrial lineages are significantly higher than in aquatic nodes (P = 0.0015; Extended Data Fig. 3a and Supplementary Information section 1.1.1). In summary, most terrestrialization events seem to display high levels of gene turnover, reflecting genome plasticity24 during the animal transition from water to land associated with new environmental challenges. Arachnids and hexapods show lower levels of plasticity, which may indicate that their evolution was dominated by gene co-option instead.

A total of 154 genomes were analysed to infer HGs and reconstruct ancestral states. Each bar chart represents one terrestrial event node and its three immediate ancestors. For each node, five categories of HGs are quantified: novel, novel core, expanded, contracted and lost. The y axis indicates the number of HGs in each category of each clade. Organism silhouettes (sourced from phylopic.org and the authors, released under public domain dedication (CC0 1.0 Universal)) represent 11 terrestrial events.

To infer functional convergence across the 11 terrestrial events, we annotated the functions of their novel and novel core HGs using both gene ontology (GO)25,26 and Pfam protein domains27. The number of shared GO terms among at least ten nodes are shown in Fig. 3a and shared Pfams among at least five nodes are shown in Fig. 3c. For novel HGs, there are 118 GO terms shared by different combinations of at least 10 nodes (green bars in Fig. 3a; Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Fig. 1), and 26 for novel core HGs (blue bars in Fig. 3a, and Supplementary Table 4). Our analyses show that novel gene families that emerged independently in different terrestrialization events are involved in osmosis (regulation of water transport in cells), metabolism (namely fatty acids, probably related to changes in diet), reproduction, detoxification, sensory reception and reaction to stimuli. All gene families reported here stem from the genome-wide comparative analysis of every HG, and none was chosen a priori.

a, Distribution of shared GO terms of gene novelty across terrestrialization. Bars indicate the number of GO terms from novel HGs and novel core HGs shared by at least ten terrestrial nodes. The UpSet diagram was generated using the UpSetR R package60. b, Tree map visualization of GO terms from novel HGs shared across terrestrialization. The 55 most specific GO terms from the 118 shared novel HGs are grouped into 3 major GO categories: biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. Tree maps were generated with REVIGO61. The hierarchical layout illustrates the relationships among GO terms within each category. c, Distribution of shared Pfam domains of gene novelty across terrestrialization. Bars indicate the number of Pfam domains from novel HGs (green) and novel core HGs (blue) shared by at least five terrestrial nodes, the orange bar indicates only one Pfam domain shared among fully terrestrial lineages. These Pfams are labelled above the bars using short names.

The 55 ‘most specific' (‘bottom' in the GO hierarchy) GO functions (Fig. 3b) in novel HGs include locomotion, membrane ion transport and transporter activity (osmosis), response to stimulus and neuronal functions (detection and reaction to stimulus), as well as metabolic, reproductive and developmental processes (lifecycle and diet adaptations). Additionally, cellular components include plasma membrane (related to better nutrient uptake, cell barriers and detoxification in adaptation to life on land28) and protein-containing complex (a crucial factor of membrane protein insertion29). Pfam domains echo these functions, recovering osmoregulation by neurotransmitter-gated ion channel domains, stimulus and neuronal functions by transmembrane receptor, and detoxification by cytochrome P450 (Fig. 3c). Moreover, the total number of HGs performing these functions also increased in terrestrial nodes (Supplementary Information section 1.2.1 and Extended Data Fig. 4), especially in Bdelloidea, Clitellata, Tardigrada, Onychophora, Armadillidium and Tetrapoda. Genes encompassed by these GO terms in humans (tetrapods) and the fruit fly (hexapods) also highlight the importance of biological functions linked to terrestrialization (Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Information section 1.2.2). Biological functions specific to terrestrial nodes further support these key adaptations to survival in terrestrial environments. Unique GO or unique Pfams are GO terms or Pfams associated with novel genes that are present in terrestrial nodes that are absent in the GO terms or Pfams of their ancestor nodes (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). All nodes except bdelloid rotifers and arachnids contain unique GOs, and all except stylommatophorans and arachnids contain unique Pfams. Shared unique GOs and Pfams are related to metabolism (fatty acid metabolism and kinase activity) and ion transport, which would have helped terrestrial animals maintain water and osmotic balance30 and allow them to interact with new terrestrial environments, diets and adapt their life cycles. Although some functions of terrestrial novel genes represent exaptations from freshwater ancestors (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 5), these novel genes remain functionally distinct from genes in aquatic lineages (Extended Data Fig. 3b and Supplementary Information section 1.1.2). Also, some functions appear to be contingent, being gained early and later lost in terrestrial events (Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 6).

For gene families predating these transitions, we investigated the presence of convergent gene expansions and contractions across the terrestrialization events using CAFE522. These gene families are shared with aquatic ancestors and relatives, so their convergent change in gene repertoire is an indication of parallel exaptations. Our analysis revealed ten HGs that significantly expanded their gene copy numbers in different combinations of four terrestrial nodes (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 7); no shared expanded HGs were found in more than four events. These convergently expanded gene families are involved in detoxification, oxidative stress, metabolism and reception of stimuli. Notable examples include the gene families cytochrome P450, which has crucial roles in xenobiotic metabolism particularly in the digestive tract31; flavin-containing monooxygenases, essential for processing toxic plant metabolites32; and glutathione S-transferase, which reduces reactive oxygen species and shows contraction in cetaceans33. We also find expansions in the G-protein-coupled receptor family, which is crucial for sensing environmental stimuli such as odours and light34. GO term enrichment analysis of expanded HGs, using the bilaterian ancestral genes as background, further supported the importance of stimulus response and ion transport functions in terrestrialization (Supplementary Information section 1.2.3, Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 8).

a, Shared expanded HGs across terrestrial nodes. b, Shared contracted HGs across terrestrial nodes. The UpSet diagrams show the intersections of HGs across different combinations of 11 terrestrial nodes. Bars indicate shared expanded and contracted HGs among at least four terrestrial events (green), semi-terrestrial events (blue), and fully terrestrial events (orange). Semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial groups are differentiated by blue and orange in set sizes (bottom left). HGs with no more than three members are labelled above the bars, other HGs are listed in Supplementary Table 7 (expanded) and Supplementary Table 10 (contracted). Approaches for HGs expansion and contraction inference and functional annotations are described in the Methods.

In summary, our results suggest that gene gains (novel, novel core and expanded gene families) are a key driver across all the transitions from water to land, indicating that functions such as response to stimuli, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism and ion transporter activity had an important role in these adaptive processes.

Gene reduction is another important genetic change in terrestrial events, including lost and contracted genes. Lost HGs are relatively higher in number than gene gains in most nodes (Fig. 2). We identified lost HGs shared in terrestrial events (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 9) and found the Dbl-homology domain gene family lost in 8 out of 11 terrestrial events, and the pleckstrin-homology domain gene family lost in 7 out of 11 terrestrial events; these are retained mainly in bdelloids, stylommatophorans, myriapods and tetrapods. For reference, there are no gene families convergently expanded or contracted in more than four nodes (Fig. 4), thus finding lost HGs in seven or eight terrestrial nodes is remarkable. Both domains are components of guanine nucleotide exchange factors of Rho GTPases (RhoGEF), implicated in regeneration (neurons35 and muscles36) and wound healing37. Other lost HGs among terrestrial events include chlorophyllase protein family (chlorophyll degradation38), potentially indicating dietary shifts during land colonization, and the Shugoshin C-terminal domain-containing protein, which regulates chromosome cohesion and segregation during meiosis and is involved in reproduction39.

Gene families showing convergent reduction in copy number also point to key adaptations to life on land. There are four HGs that are convergently contracted in at least four terrestrial lineages (green bars in Fig. 4b, and Supplementary Table 10): chloride channel protein members (osmoregulation40), two different carbohydrate sulfotransferases (extracellular communication and adhesion41), and melatonin-related receptors (circadian rhythms42).

We categorized the terrestrial lineages as semi-terrestrial or fully terrestrial according to their dependence on water, as no consensus definition of terrestriality is universally accepted. Semi-terrestrial animals rely on humid environments to avoid drying out, and include bdelloid rotifers, nematodes, tardigrades and some microscopic annelids, which require a film of water or pore spaces to live in43, as well as onychophorans and other annelids (such as clitellates). Fully terrestrial animals are less water-dependent, and encompass lineages such as land gastropods44, Arachnida, Myriapoda, Armadillidium (woodlice), Hexapoda5 and Tetrapoda. We compared GO and Pfam compositions associated with novel genes of terrestrial animal clades to capture function variation, performing both principal component analysis (PCA; Supplementary Fig. 8) and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA; Fig. 5 and Supplementary Information section 1.3). In the PCoA based on Jaccard dissimilarity, semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial groups showed partial separation, and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) confirmed significant differences between the two groups with both GO terms (Fig. 5a; R2 = 0.0995, P < 0.01) and Pfams (Fig. 5b; R2 = 0.0992, P < 0.01); group dispersions did not differ (GOs: P = 0.128; Pfams: P = 0.064). The enriched novel gene functions reveal that semi-terrestrial species carry an expansive and versatile toolkit for environmental flexibility, emphasizing cuticle remodelling, visual development and stress response, while fully terrestrial species display a small and streamlined set centred on neuronal development and ion membrane homeostasis vital for permanent colonization (Supplementary Table 11).

Each dot represents 1 of the 61 sampled terrestrial species, coloured by taxonomic group as indicated in the legend. Distances between dots correspond to Jaccard dissimilarities. Statistical ellipses highlight the semi-terrestrial group (orange; including Bdelloidea, Clitellata, Nematoda, Tardigrada and Onychophora) and the fully terrestrial group (green; including Stylommatophora, Arachnida, Myriapoda, Armadillidium, Hexapoda and Tetrapoda). Ellipses were generated using normal distribution parameters to visualize clustering patterns of taxonomic groups (95% confidence). The two axes represent the first two principal coordinates (PCoA1 and PCoA2) with their respective explained percentages of variation. Group separation was tested with PERMANOVA, which showed the significant differences between semi- and fully terrestrial groups for GO terms (R2 = 0.0995, P < 0.01) and Pfam domains (R2 = 0.0992, P < 0.01). Group dispersions did not differ (GOs: P = 0.128; Pfams: P = 0.064). Approaches for functional annotations are described in the Methods.

Notably, consistent with this expansive-versus-streamlined enrichment pattern, semi-terrestrial groups share broad biological functions whereas fully terrestrial lineages show little overlap. Gene gains (Supplementary Information sections 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 and Supplementary Fig. 9 for novel genes, Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 7 for expanded genes) across semi-terrestrial lineages converged on crucial functions for land adaptation, including circulatory system development, osmoregulation, nutrient processing, muscle function, energy metabolism, detoxification and sensory response mechanisms. These adaptations enabled essential physiological processes required for semi-terrestrial animals to cope with soil-dependent environments, from basic survival needs such as gas exchange, locomotion and nutrient uptake to environmental challenges such as osmotic stress and exposure to pollutants. By contrast, fully terrestrial lineages show limited convergence in the functions associated with gene novelty, with no shared GO terms and only one Pfam domain among novel genes and few shared expanded HGs (Figs. 3c and 4a, Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Information section 1.3.4). Most shared adaptations among fully terrestrial lineages are found in arthropods, where each terrestrial lineage emerged independently from aquatic ancestors that likely started from a similar genetic toolkit and evolved parallel streamlining later. Only glucose transport and stimulus sensing mechanisms are shared between woodlice and land snails, suggesting that fully terrestrial lineages probably evolved through diverse rather than common adaptive patterns. In addition, both semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial lineages display diverse gene reduction patterns, with few shared reductions (Fig. 4b for contraction, Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 14 for lost genes) except within arthropods, indicating low convergence of gene reduction across both habitat categories.

By uncovering novel core and exclusively expanded HGs, we inspected the gene functions associated with each of the 11 terrestrial nodes (Supplementary Information section 1.4 and Supplementary Tables 15–18). These include stress-response genes in bdelloid rotifers, nervous system and muscle adaptations of clitellates, shell formation, mucus secretion and estivation genes in land snails, and cuticle-related genes in nematodes. Tardigrades exhibit unique stress-resistance genes, whereas onychophorans share traits such as oxygen adaptation and nutrient uptake with woodlice. Arthropods and tetrapods, as well-studied terrestrial lineages, were further explored for their distinct adaptations.

Arthropods, the most diverse animal phylum, originated in the sea and colonized the land multiple times independently. In this study, we focus on the fully terrestrial clades Hexapoda, Myriapoda and Arachnida and the crustacean Armadillidium5 (Supplementary Information section 1.4.7). These lineages exhibit convergent evolution of traits for terrestrial adaptation, such as exoskeleton structure, water conservation and sensory development (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 7). For instance, myriapods and hexapods expand gene families linked to the synthesis of the exoskeleton wax layer responsible for waterproofing45. Similarly, retinol-binding protein genes required in the retinal pigment cells expanded in arthropods to adapt their vision to light conditions on land46. Hexapods5 show enriched GO annotations in expanded genes (Supplementary Table 15) related to moulting (for example, terpenoid metabolic process, juvenile hormone metabolic process, sesquiterpenoid metabolic process and steroid metabolic process) and vision (for example, rhodopsin biosynthetic process).

The other major lineage of terrestrial animals is land vertebrates (Supplementary Information section 1.4.8), which show both novel and expanded genes with enriched GO annotations related to immunity functions (Supplementary Table 18 for novel HGs, Supplementary Tables 15 and 16 for expanded HGs): T cell co-stimulation, positive regulation of activated T cell proliferation, and innate immunity-related processes (for example, neutrophil degranulation and specific granule lumen). Similar innate immunity functions are also found in expanded gene families, such as the Ly-6/uPAR family, siglecs, mucins and resistin. Previous studies have also supported innate immunity as crucial to evolving a specialized and reinforced epidermis with an active keratinization process and a resistant outer stratum corneum47. These defend against pathogens that spread in the terrestrial environment, forming both physical and chemical barriers48, as evidenced by our study.

The invasion of land by life influenced global biogeochemical cycles through effects on carbon storage and weathering, representing a notable milestone in the evolutionary history of the planet1. Land plant colonization paved the way to new habitats for animals and fungi and produced the emergence of new ecosystems49. Molecular timescales estimate the age of lineages, including soft-bodied animals that may not be well-represented in the fossil record. Here we focus on the terrestrialization events for which we have more than one taxon or genome. Our molecular evolutionary timescale (Fig. 1) is congruent with other recent studies50 and shows that the animal conquest of land occurred in three major temporal windows. These windows might not overlap and may be separated by millions of years, each contributing to the complexity of terrestrial ecosystems.

The first temporal window of terrestrialization occurred between the Middle Cambrian and Middle Ordovician epochs. Early land plants emerged49 approximately 515.0–473.6 million years ago (Ma), quickly followed by nematodes and arthropods. Our study suggests that nematodes (533.9–421.9 Ma), myriapods (521.9–402.8 Ma), hexapods (487.6–436.9 Ma) and arachnids (489.7–435.2 Ma) were among the first animals to transition to land, overlapping the rise of early land plants; an arthropod-focused study similarly reports temporal concordance5. A study estimated the origin of nematodes between Ediacaran and Silurian periods51 (620–455 Ma), overlapping, or even preceding, our interval. These early terrestrial species developed traits helping mitigate desiccation and providing structural support, including the arthropod exoskeletons and the nematode cuticles. In our analyses, gene gains in these lineages shared functions associated with cuticle formation, exoskeleton maintenance and lipid metabolism, as well as involvement in responses to drought, excessive light and oxidative stress (Supplementary Table 19), consistent with selection for water conservation and stress tolerance in patchy, intermittently wet terrestrial settings shaped by cryptogamic and bryophyte covers52.

The second temporal window of terrestrialization spans the Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous subperiod, a time of episodic flooding, deepening soils and strongly seasonal wetlands53. In this ecological setting, clitellate annelids (464.5–262.8 Ma) and the first tetrapods (351.2–337.7 Ma) independently adapted to land. The first land vertebrates evolved limbs for locomotion, lungs for aerial respiration and skin barriers to minimize water loss4. Clitellates adapted their nervous and muscular systems to cope with terrestrial challenges, enhancing locomotion and desiccation resistance. These species contributed to the establishment of modern terrestrial niches by enhancing nutrient cycling, improving soil structure and influencing ecosystem communities, thereby laying the conditions for further evolutionary innovations in terrestrial life. The floodplains of this period likely provided the ecological opportunities and selection pressures that drove these terrestrial transitions.

The third temporal window of terrestrialization, between 130–86 Ma during the Cretaceous period, saw bdelloid rotifers (180.9–78.4 Ma) and land gastropods (127.1–39.3 Ma) making their way onto land and sharing it with dinosaurs, as well as early mammals and birds. Bdelloid rotifers evolved exceptional stress tolerance mechanisms, including resistance to desiccation, extreme temperatures, and radiation, enabling them to thrive in harsh environments. Meanwhile, terrestrial snails developed adaptations such as shell formation, mucus secretion, and estivation to withstand diverse climatic conditions. At the molecular level, both clades exhibit gene expansions (Supplementary Table 19) in HGs, including ammonium transporters for water and ion homeostasis, NADP-dependent oxidoreductases54 and G-protein-coupled receptors for stress resistance. These shared adaptations are likely to reflect Cretaceous greenhouse landscapes, characterized by high sea levels, angiosperm expansion, coastal wetlands and seasonally dry microhabitats55 that favoured water and ion conservation and broad stress tolerance.

We applied comprehensive comparative genomic analysis to uncover the convergent evolutionary processes underlying 11 independent terrestrialization events. Our results reveal that these are marked by extensive gene turnover across all 11 lineages, adaptations to terrestrial environments. We found that terrestrial events generally display a high level of genomic novelties, mainly related to osmoregulation, stress response, immunity, sensory reception, metabolism and reproduction. We found shared ion transport functions in gene novelty, supporting their critical role in the adaptation from water to land by maintaining water and ionic balance. This is especially crucial for animals adapting to low-salinity and dry environments, as it involves changes in osmoregulation to maintain ion and water homeostasis and prevent water loss. Gene reductions show notably large numbers in terrestrial lineages, with some convergent losses of genes related to regeneration56. Although all terrestrial lineages exhibit a certain degree of convergent functional evolution, semi-terrestrial lineages share functional and molecular features, whereas fully terrestrial animals do not. However, it should be noted that habitat classifications are diverse and not universal. For example, another classification, including cryptic forms, poikilohydric organisms and homoiohydric organisms, categorizes Myriapoda and woodlice as cryptic forms2, whereas here they are classified as fully terrestrial5. More comparisons using various classifications are needed in the future. In addition to the convergent emergence of biological functions, each terrestrial lineage exhibits unique adaptations to land. The distinct features indicate the various genomic pathways to thrive in terrestrial environments. Additionally, three major temporal windows of terrestrialization identified by our molecular timescale occurred during the Ordovician, Devonian–Carboniferous and Cretaceous periods. These windows were potentially driven by major ecological and geological changes, forming new terrestrial niches. These results largely support the temporal congruence between the rise of land plants and the first window of terrestrial animals, providing new insights into the tempo of terrestrialization. There are interesting convergences between the adaptation to life on land by plants and terrestrial animals19. Plants also evolved genes linked to adaptations to life outside of the water similarly to animals, such as lignin to avoid desiccation and environmental responses (abscisic acid, salicylic acid and jasmonic acid). However, they also present new genes related to UV light protection, a signal that is not observed in animals.

The study faces certain limitations, such as the classification of terrestrialization highlighted above. Moreover, annotating lost and contracted genes poses challenges as these are lost in the most common model organisms, which are the reference for many functional annotations. For example, a significantly contracted HG in nematodes contains no gene copies in Caenorhabditis elegans and only a few poorly annotated copies in other nematodes. Functional analysis for such HGs often relies on distant homologues in humans or fruit flies, which may not accurately reflect functions owing to substantial sequence divergence across lineages. In more extreme cases, where the HGs are lost in traditional model organisms, annotation becomes virtually impossible. Similarly, many lost genes are classified as uncharacterized proteins, reflecting their absence in well-studied terrestrial models. Another methodological limitation is that we did not determine whether gene duplications occurred at the terrestrial nodes or independently within lineages, as CAFE5 infers gene expansions based on copy number, not gene trees. However, the observed expansions remain robust and meaningful as they consistently occur in terrestrial lineages, regardless of when they arose. Also, although our study relies on a robust phylogenetic framework, phylogenetic position incongruence complicates interpretations of terrestrial transitions, such as the debated relationships with Chelicerata. We followed recent studies that place Xiphosura as the sister group to Arachnida57, implying a single origin of terrestrialization in arachnids, whereas some placements propose that Xiphosura may be nested within arachnids58, which would suggest an alternative scenario. Additionally, there is limited taxon sampling for certain lineages, such as tardigrades, onychophorans and woodlice, which may lead to HG numbers that are not representative of the gene content of the clade. In the future, with more and more genomes being sequenced, the inclusion of more taxa in datasets will be possible. Future efforts should also focus on developing advanced annotation tools for lost and contracted genes, such as machine learning approaches (for example, language models59) to overcome challenges caused by sequence divergence and limited homologues. Moreover, improving gene family expansion inference by integrating gene tree-based approaches will be crucial to pinpoint duplication events more precisely.

This study uses an integrative approach, seamlessly combining comparative genomic analysis, functional annotation and evolutionary timescale reconstruction. By leveraging the InterEvo framework, which assesses the overlap of biological functions in genes repeatedly gained or reduced in these transitions, we systematically reveal the convergent genomic patterns across diverse metazoan taxa, capturing the breadth of animal diversity and providing a robust methodology for studying convergent genome evolution. Furthermore, the analysis incorporates diverse comparisons across terrestrial lineages, offering a comprehensive perspective on both global trends and category-specific patterns of terrestrial adaptations. Many genomic adaptations to terrestrial animal life are convergent, suggesting broadly predictable molecular responses. Yet, convergence is part of the story. Each terrestrial lineage also displays its own contingent adaptations, shaped by its unique evolutionary history, genomic background and ecological context. Even when facing similar challenges, different lineages often arrive at distinct molecular solutions, reflecting their ancestral constraints and trajectories. Terrestrialization, therefore, illustrates the interplay between convergence and contingency, highlighting both the repeatability and the uniqueness of evolutionary innovation.

We compiled 154 genome samplings from published projects uploaded in UniProt62, NCBI63, Ensembl64 and other resources (Supplementary Table 1). 154 genomes were downloaded, containing 3,934,362 predicted proteins, including 151 metazoan and 3 unicellular organism genomes. A side script provided by OrthoFinder (primary_transcript.py) and Cd-hit v.4.8.1 (ref. 65) (using a similarity threshold of 1.00) were used to extract the canonical proteins from the original data. The quality of canonical proteins from 154 genomes were assessed by BUSCO v.5.4.7 (ref. 66) (Supplementary Table 1). The completeness greater than 85% and fragmentation less than 15% were preferable. It should be noted that we considered not only genome completeness but also the habitat and phylogeny of the species, so we selected some genomes that did not perfectly meet the above standard. We then inferred HGs by Orthofinder v.2.5.5 (ref. 67), using dependencies of MAFFT v.7.505 (ref. 68) and DIAMOND v.2.1.8 (ref. 69). The HGs were then used for analysing gene content.

We drew a guide tree that was used for gene expansions/contractions analyses and the later time tree. This guide tree, based on the species positions inferred from previous literature70,71,72,73, was used to build the phylogeny of metazoans through the following steps. While some nodes are controversial (namely the position of sponges, ctenophors, or acoels), they are far removed from the terrestrial nodes of interest. First, we started from the conserved single-copy genes in the Metazoa_odb10 from BUSCO v.5.4.7 (ref. 66). Homo sapiens contains 943 of these genes, which were extracted to serve as reference orthologous. These identified conserved protein sequences were aligned using MAFFT v.7.505 (ref. 68) and trimmed using trimAl v.1.4.rev.15 (ref. 74) to remove poorly aligned regions. Next, we concatenated the trimmed alignments into a single supermatrix using FASconCAT-G v.1.05.1 (ref. 75). Finally, the concatenated supermatrix was used to build the phylogeny with IQ-TREE v.2.2.2.6 (ref. 76), using C60 + G + I model, using the guide tree as a constraint, and performing 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The resulting phylogeny, with branch lengths representing genetic changes, was subsequently used in CAFE5 for further analysis (see following methods).

Novel HGs: HGs that are present in at least one species within the LCA of a lineage (following we called a node), while being absent in all species of outgroup.

Novel core HGs: HGs that are present in all species within a node (or absent only once for node containing more than three species), while being absent in all species of outgroup. For the node with two species, novel HGs are equal to novel core HGs.

Lost HGs: HGs that are lost in all species within a node, while being present in the sister groups and other species in outgroup.

Expanded HGs: the increase in the number of gene copies occurred within HGs, often due to gene duplication events.

Contracted HGs: the reduction in the number of gene copies occurred within HGs.

Ancestral HGs: all HGs present in a node.

Novel, novel core and lost HGs were inferred by our host pipeline Phylogenetically Aware Parsing Script described by Paps and Holland11 (GitHub: https://github.com/PapsLab) with Perl v.5.30.0.

Expanded and contracted HGs were inferred by CAFE522. First, we generated an ultrametric phylogenetic tree with ape, TreeTools and phytools packages in R, based on phylogenetic tree built using IQ-TREE. CAFE5 was launched with the ultrametric tree. Owing to the large dataset, we were unable to run the entire phylogeny at once; therefore, we split the phylogeny into three smaller trees: Lophotrochozoa, Ecdysozoa and Deuterostomia. For each smaller tree, CAFE5 was run with Poisson distribution and error model, applying two- and three-lambda models ten times each to test convergence of Model Base Final Likelihood (-lnL). We selected the highest lnL from two- and three-lambda models to compare their fit using a likelihood ratio test with chi-squared distribution (via lmtest package in R), which indicated that three-lambda models are a better fit for all three phylogenies (P < 0.001). However, further tests using simulation function of CAFE5 revealed that values (including lambda and -lnL) of three-lambda model of Deuterostomia fluctuated, while that of two-lambda model were stable, thus the two-lambda model was judged to be the better fit for this phylogeny. For Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa, the simulation tests showed stable values for the three-lambda models, which were therefore chosen as the better fit (Supplementary Table 20).

To test the robustness, novel core HGs were tested by BLASTp v.2.14.0 +77 using NCBI RefSeq database78 (downloaded on 23 August 2023), which contains a broad range of high-quality molecular sequences. We launched BLASTp locally and searched novel core HGs against RefSeq records, excluding protein sequences from the in-groups (terrestrial nodes) with the option “-negative_taxidlist”. The results shown that BLASTp returned very weak hits; the vast majority of sequences had e-value > 10−10 and identity <50% (Supplementary Table 21).

We evaluated if the number of novel genes emerging per million years in terrestrial nodes differ from aquatic nodes. We collected the rate of emergence of novel gene in 11 terrestrial nodes and randomly selected 11 aquatic nodes (Actinopterygii, Ambulacraria, Bivalvia, Branchiopoda, Chondrichthyes, Cnidaria, Decapoda, Platyhelminthes, Priapulida, Sabellida and Vetigastropoda). We calculated the observed total evolutionary rate in the 11 terrestrial nodes as the total number of novel HGs divided by total divergence time (Rterr = 4.900). We then performed 10,000 bootstrap draws: in each permutation we sampled (with replacement) 11 aquatic nodes from this pool, recalculated the evolutionary rate (Rboot = total novel HG counts divided by total divergence time) and recorded the value, producing a null distribution of novel gene rates in aquatic nodes. The empirical one-tailed P value was the proportion of bootstraps with Rboot ≥ Rterr.

We assessed if the GO term composition of terrestrial lineages differs from that of aquatic lineages. We included lineages with the biggest taxon sampling from random aquatic lineages, including Actinopterygii, Ambulacraria, Bivalvia, Branchiopoda, Cnidaria, Decapoda and Platyhelminthes. We converted the GO matrix derived from the novel genes for each lineage into a binary presence/absence matrix, then quantified the dissimilarity between terrestrial and aquatic GO term profiles by measuring the proportion of non-shared terms (Jaccard distance). For the permutation test, we randomly reshuffled the ‘aquatic/terrestrial' labels across lineages 10,000 times; in each permutation we rebuilt the two group profiles and recalculated Jaccard distance between them. The empirical P value was the proportion of permutations distance ≥ the observed distance.

Both analyses were conducted in R using the packages vegan, car and ggplot2.

For each terrestrial event, we selected one species as representative. Rotaria sordida in Bdelloidea, Eisenia andrei in Clitellata, Candidula unifasciata in Stylommatophora, Pristionchus pacificus in Nematoda, Ramazzottius varieornatusa in Tardigrada, Epiperipatus broadwayi in Onychophora, Centruroides sculpturatus in Arachnida, Rhysida immarginata in Myriapoda, Armadillidium nasatum in Armadillidium, Drosophila melanogaster in Hexapoda, H. sapiens in Tetrapoda. For annotating Pfam domains and GO terms of the HGs of interest, egg-NOG-mapper v.2 (ref. 79) was applied online with default parameters. Further analysis of names of genes of interest was performed in UniProt62 using mapping IDs in sequence headers. We also used PANTHER 19.0 (ref. 80) to classify genes with ‘protein class'.

We conducted GO enrichment analysis to find overrepresented GO terms in novel and expanded HGs of terrestrial events, using background of GO terms hitting all HGs present in the LCA of Bilateria. Using Fisher's exact test, we compared the number of HGs hitting each GO term between the terrestrial events and bilaterian background. The P values for multiple comparisons were corrected with the Benjamini–Hochberg method. GO terms with adjusted P values < 0.05 were considered significantly enriched. In another way, we also used all HGs present in the LCA of terrestrial events as background to perform enrichment analysis, such as GO terms hitting expanded HGs of hexapods comparing with GO terms hitting all HGs present in LCA hexapods. However, to ensure normalization across all terrestrial events, we chose bilaterian background for the following analysis.

To identify biological functions driving the separation of semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial groups (following the PCoA), we tested differential presence of GO terms or Pfams between semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial groups using binary matrices (present/absent). Functional terms that lacked variability (present in all species or in none) were discarded. For every remaining feature we compiled a 2 × 2 contingency table (presence/absence number of species in two habitat categories) and subjected it to a two-tailed Fisher's Exact Test in R, using the marginal totals across entire pool of species as the background. P values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. The functional terms with adjusted P < 0.05 were considered significantly enriched and those of P < 0.01 were reported. To retain biological relevance, we excluded the functional terms present in ≤10% proportion in both groups.

To compare the distribution in GO terms linked to novel and ancestral HGs among semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial lineages, we performed a PCA. PCA was conducted using the prcomp function in R. The GO terms of species were plotted using the first two principal components, PC1 and PC2. Statistical analyses were applied to assess differences between semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial groups. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD) test was performed on the principal components scores to evaluate significant differences among these two groups and pairwise comparisons. Then, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted to examine the combined effect of these two groups on PC1 and PC2, respectively. Two ellipses, using normal distribution-based ellipse fitting, were merged based on their habitats, representing semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial groups. The semi-terrestrial group includes bdelloid rotifers, clitellates, nematodes, tardigrades and onychophorans, while fully terrestrial group includes stylommatophorans, arachnids, myriapods, Armadillidium, hexapods and tetrapods. The analyses were performed in R using the ggplot2, ggforce and car packages.

However, because shared absences might bias Euclidean-based PCA on binary presence/absence data, inflating similarity between groups that simply lack many of the same features, we further performed PCoA. We quantified compositional differences in GO term and Pfam presence/absence profiles between semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial species based on Jaccard dissimilarity. Pairwise dissimilarities among species were computed using the Jaccard distance in vegan R package. We then performed PCoA on the Jaccard distance matrix. The two axis labels explain the percentages of Jaccard distance variation. To test for overall group difference between semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial groups, we performed a PERMANOVA (adonis2 function) on the Jaccard distances with 10,000 permutations, with reassigning species to the two groups. To confirm the PERMANOVA results are not driven by unequal within-group spread, we tested for homogeneity of multivariate dispersion using betadisper function with permutations of sample–group labels (centroids recomputed each 999 permutation). Plots were generated using ggplot2 package and group ellipses represent 95% concentration regions. The comparison between freshwater and terrestrial species used the same methods described above.

Molecular clock analysis was performed using a two-step approach in MCMCTree81 (PAML package82). Using the previously described concatenated alignment of 943 conserved orthologous genes generated using BUSCO v.5.4.7 (ref. 66), MAFFT v.7.505 (ref. 68), trimAl v.1.4.rev.15 (ref. 74) and FASconCAT-G v.1.05.1 (ref. 75). The analysis was conducted in two steps. In the first step, branch lengths were estimated by maximum likelihood using CODEML83, which calculated the gradient and Hessian of the likelihood function at the maximum likelihood estimates. We used the Empirical + F model (model = 3) and an independent rates clock model (clock = 2). Subsequently, MCMCTree was executed to estimate divergence times, using the same independent rates clock model and discrete gamma distribution with 4 categories and a shape parameter alpha = 0.5. Using an R script provided by MCMCTree tutorial (GitHub: https://github.com/sabifo4/Tutorial_MCMCtree), the prior for the substitution rate was determined based on the approximate root age (591.255 Ma), resulting in a gamma distribution with shape α = 2 and scale β = 5.1. For each analysis, we ran the MCMC for about 20 million generations, with the first 100,000 generations discarded as burn-in, sampling every 1,000 generations to obtain 20,000 samples. To ensure convergence and reliability of the results, we performed six independent Markov chain Monte Carlo runs. We assessed convergence using Tracer v.1.7.2 (ref. 84), which showed effective sample sizes exceeding 200 for all parameters across all runs. Based on the consistency of results across runs and comparative summary statistics, we selected the fourth run for our final divergence time estimates (Supplementary Table 22).

The pipeline used in this study comprises three main analyses following homology group (HG) inference and ancestral genome reconstruction. Analyses of expanded HGs, contracted HGs, and lost HGs involve identifying HGs shared across transition nodes. Analyses of novel and expanded HGs involve identifying shared biological functions (including Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Pfam domains) across transition nodes, followed by enrichment analysis. The workflow integrates comparative genomics, homology inference, and functional annotation to detect convergent evolution patterns across independent terrestrialisation events.

Species tree of the 154 taxa sampled in this study. The habitat types are indicated as follows: marine (dark blue nodes), brackish (grey nodes), freshwater (light blue nodes), semi-terrestrial (yellow circles with green outlines), and fully terrestrial (red circles with green outlines).

a, Permutation test assesing whether the rate of novel genes emergence per million years (Myr) in terrestrial nodes is significantly higher than in aquatic nodes. The observed terrestrial rate is indicated by the red bar. b, Permutation test assesing whether the biological functions in terrestrial nodes are significantly different from those in other nodes The observed GO distance between terrestrial and aquatic groups is indicated by the red bar. See Supplementary Text 1.1 for details.

The heatmap compares the number of novel HGs associated with 10 most specific GO terms in terrestrial nodes and their three immediate ancestors. These 10 GO terms were selected from the bottom-level hierarchy of the 27 GO terms of novel genes shared across all terrestrial nodes. Terrestrial nodes are highlighted in green text, and their ancestor nodes are shown in black. Columns represent GO terms, and cells show the number of novel HGs associated with each term. The colour gradient from red (low) through white to blue (high) represents the log-transformed values of HG numbers to improve visualisation of differences in scale.

Scientists identified a gene in the amygdala that can cause anxiety by over-expressing itself. They treated that gene in mice and saw an instant change.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Anxiety plagues hundreds of millions of people, including over 40 million adults and 4 million children in the U.S. alone. Some psychologists even see it as an epidemic. Dystopian headlines in the news, not to mention the doomscrolling sessions they breed, already seem like enough to trigger near-apocalyptic levels of anxiety, but (dumpster fires and social media aside) its origins were uncertain—until now. 

There was previously some idea about which part of the brain that anxious feeling crawled out of. Overactivation of the amygdala, which processes emotional stimuli, switches on an inflammatory response when faced with stress. Inflammation is at least partly behind conditions that involve anxiety and depression (common comorbidities). Stress is also often a contributing factor, which can lead to the dysfunction of neurotransmitters like serotonin and epinephrine (antidepressants can help treat this dysfunction by raising neurotransmitter levels). But something was still missing from the picture.

Neuroscientist Juan Lerma, from the Institute for Neurosciences in San Juan de Alicante, Spain, investigated further. He and his research team found that over-expression of one gene can stress the amygdala and put the brain on edge. The Grik4 gene encodes a protein in the central nervous system that functions as a neurotransmitter and excites neurons. Butut this can cross the threshold to neural overexcitement. Lerma wanted to see what would happen if he targeted specific neurons in the amygdalas of mice that had been genetically modified with extra copies of Grik4.



“The amygdala, particularly its hyperactivity, is strongly implicated in anxiety,” he said in a study recently published in the journal iScience. “Mice overexpressing the Grik4 gene display anxiety, depression, social deficits, and disrupted amygdala excitability.”

Lerma gave the mice injections that balanced Grik4 levels in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala. Previous studies have suggested that this region helps with overcoming stress by regulating how the brain learns after a stressful experience. Neurons in the basolateral nucleus are what are called pyramidal neurons, which increase neural activity and are important for many cognitive functions, including consciousness and memory. The researchers focused on these neurons because of their potential to become overexcited. 

Grik4 is expressed throughout the amygdala, and if expression spikes in basolateral amygdala neurons, it can affect communication with neurons in the central amygdala—especially a group in the centrolateral amygdala, which are responsible for firing nerve impulses. These messages travel through the neuron, releasing a neurotransmitter at the synapse, where it is transferred to the end of the next neuron (this is how neurons communicate). Lowering Grik4 levels normalized communication between neural groups in the basolateral and centrolateral amygdala.

Levels of anxiety, depression, and social interaction were measured in the mice using behavioral tests and electrophysiological recordings. Before the mice with excess Grik4 were treated, they preferred closed spaces away from other mice and showed no interest in socializing with mice they had not been introduced to before. Adjusting Grik4 levels allowed neurons to communicate properly and reversed symptoms of anxiety and social withdrawal. Both the genetically modified lab mice and wild mice already prone to anxiety showed positive results after treatment.

“The identification of such a critical role for a small population of neurons in the [centrolateral] amygdala circuitry with specific firing properties pinpoints how subtle changes in input strength may be enough to reversibly distort circuit activity and provides a new target for the therapy of affective disorders,” Lerma said.

Further research will look at how other parts of the brain, such as the hippocampus, may be involved in conditions that produce or contribute to high anxiety. Opportunities for human research might arise in the future, but until then, some deep breathing exercises can help.

Geopolitical tensions are affecting international collaborations in key areas of research, including the semiconductor sector.Credit: Rebecca Bailey/AFP via Getty

Data indicate that geopolitical tensions are affecting how scientists around the world collaborate on research projects. But “rather than uniformly shrinking, global academic networks are being reconfigured”, says Marina Zhang, a technology and geopolitics researcher at the University of Technology Sydney, in Australia. Collaborations with Israel and Russia, and between China and the United States, are among those seeing such shifts.

Scientific collaborations between Israeli researchers and academics in other countries have declined this year, following the war in Gaza, which began in October 2023 after Hamas attacks on Israel. The analysis, by Science|Business, a network of universities, companies and research and policy organizations, looked at patterns of co-authorship in preprints indexed in the Scopus database.

Countries whose governments have been particularly critical of the Gaza war showed the biggest drops in collaborations with Israel. The percentage of all Israeli preprints that were co-authored with scientists in Spain fell from 9.2% in 2024 to 5.9% this year. Similarly, the proportion of Israeli preprints with South African co-authors declined from 3.4% in 2024 to just 1% this year (see ‘Research collaborations with Israel').

Some researchers who spoke to Nature say the data are an early indication that individual academics are boycotting Israeli science because of the war in Gaza. “This is a way of putting pressure on Israel,” says Giacomo Ortona, a nuclear physicist at Italy's National Institute for Nuclear Physics in Turin. In September, Ortona was involved in a petition calling on CERN — Europe's particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland — to suspend cooperation with Israel.

David Lehrer, director of the Centre for Applied Environmental Diplomacy at the Arava Institute, in Ketura, Israel, says the boycotts are having an impact on Israeli science. “We have recently encountered European countries such as Spain whose research institutes refuse to work with any Israeli research institute in applying for EU grants,” says Lehrer.

But Anat Paz, spokesperson for The Association of University Heads in Israel (VERA) says the data do not provide a full picture and that it is “too early to draw a conclusion” regarding the trend of collaborations involving Israeli universities. “We will have a much clearer picture once the complete data for 2025 has been compiled and reviewed early next year,” Paz adds.

In May 2024, VERA published a press release in response to a statement made by the Conference of Rectors of Spanish Universities (CRUE) expressing regret about the situation in Gaza, saying the association wishes to correct misunderstanding which “presupposes the possibility that Israeli academic institutions are not dedicated to peace and to international humanitarian law. [We] too mourn the loss of innocent life in this horrific conflict and want a better future for Palestinians and Israelis both. However, academic boycotts are dangerous and may very well cause more harm than good,” they wrote in the press release.

Indications of drop in collaborations between Israel and international research partners is part of a broader geopolitical story. A similar decline in global collaboration was seen with Russia following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Unlike individual scientists boycotting Israeli research, the decline in partnerships with Russia involves top-down policy statements from governments, most notably in the US, “to reduce or eliminate scientific work with Russia,” says Caroline Wagner, a science policy researcher at Ohio State University in Columbus.

An analysis by Nature in 2023 found research collaborations between Russia and Western institutions had dropped a year into its war on Ukraine. Some funders of these institutions and the Ukrainian government discouraged the co-authoring of papers with Russian researchers. This decline was not seen for China and India, whose collaborations with Russia increased the same year.

A separate analysis published in August this year by VoxUkraine, an independent analytical platform based in Kyiv, found that global publications with Russian co-authors dropped by 26% between 2021 and 2024. These papers were also cited less — with an 89% drop in the number of citations these papers received in 2024 compared to 2021 (see ‘Sharp fall in citations with Russian papers).

These “formal restrictions” have changed research collaborations with Russia. “Sanctions, funding cuts, brain drain, and tighter state control have deepened the decline since 2022”, says Zhang.

Declining rates of collaborations with individual countries like Russia and Israel are part of a wide-ranging reconfiguration of global academic networks, says Zhang.

Political tensions between the China and the US have also affected collaborations between the two countries. China still remains the top partner of the US, and Chinese scientists are increasingly lead joint projects with the UK, US and Europe, but the number of Chinese research papers with American co-authors dropped by 6.4% between 2017 and 2023.

Stereodivergent construction of multiple stereocentres is one of the most essential tasks in asymmetric synthesis. However, strategies for assembling all possible stereoisomers of optically active compounds bearing non-adjacent stereocentres remain scarce and suffer from certain limitations in terms of reaction types and chemical space. Here we succeed in utilizing the chain walking strategy to realize the simultaneous construction of acyclic 1,n-non-adjacent (n = 3 or 4) stereocentres via Ni-catalysed migratory hydroalkylation of trisubstituted alkenes in an enantioselective and diastereodivergent manner. A series of alkyl units can be site-selectively installed at α-C(sp3)–H sites adjacent to nitrogen, affording chiral amines bearing an α-stereogenic centre and a remote (γ- or δ-) all-alkyl-substituted stereocentre. All four stereoisomers can be accessed using a single catalyst via an appropriate selection of the olefin geometry and ligand configuration, with exceptional control of stereochemistry. This simple and mild platform offers opportunities for the streamlined synthesis of complex bioactive molecules and medicinally relevant scaffolds.

Chinese scientists have become the first to visit one of Earth's most remote and geologically intriguing realms: an underwater volcanic ridge in the Arctic Ocean.

The expedition, which concluded late last month, explored the eastern part of the Gakkel ridge — part of the global system of submerged mountain chains that play a key part in plate tectonics. A team of scientists took a submersible vessel beneath the Arctic sea ice and completed more than 40 dives, going as deep as 5,277 metres.

The analyses are far from complete, but this section of the Gakkel ridge might have hot-water vents that spew from the sea floor. Similar vents on the western, and better-explored, part of the ridge are home to bizarre ecosystems that thrive far from the reach of sunlight. They provide scientists with some of the best opportunities to understand how life might arise and evolve in icy oceans on worlds beyond Earth, such as on Jupiter's ice-encrusted moon Europa.

Expedition scientists will spend the next few years studying the rocks, water and animals that they gathered during the submersible dives. “It's the last piece of the puzzle” to understanding this unique Arctic environment, says Xiaoxia Huang, a marine geophysicist at the Institute of Deep-Sea Science and Engineering in Sanya, China, and the expedition's chief scientist.

The Gakkel ridge stretches from off the coast of Greenland to Siberia. Volcanic eruptions along it create new sea-floor crust, which spreads away from the ridge at some of the slowest rates on the planet — slower than the rate at which fingernails grow. Yet, somehow that sluggish geology manages to produce enough heat and chemical energy to sustain hydrothermal vents on the sea floor.

In 2001, a US–German expedition discovered hydrothermal vents on the western part of the Gakkel ridge1. Researchers have returned multiple times to that area to study the rich chemistry and biology of the deep, dark vent system2,3.

But the eastern side of the ridge is more remote and challenging to explore. Russian scientists have conducted some surveys, but the latest Chinese expedition is the first intensive geological survey and diving expedition in the area, Huang says.

“It's so hard to get there that anything anybody does is almost guaranteed to be exciting and different and new,” says Christopher German, a marine geochemist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. “The Chinese expedition is poised to yield significant new insights,” adds Elmar Albers, a marine geoscientist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany. 

The Chinese expedition, organized by the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, paired a deep-sea crewed submersible, named Fendouzhe, with an ice-breaker. It was the first time Fendouzhe, which has explored many parts of the oceans including the Mariana Trench, has visited the Arctic region. Other expeditions have used remotely operated vehicles to explore the Gakkel Ridge, because of the dangers of the vehicle becoming trapped under floating sea ice.

Dark excitons in atomically thin van der Waals materials provide an exciting platform for information transport and nanophotonic applications. Although dark excitons are difficult to access through free-space radiation, hybrid heterostructures incorporating plasmonic nanocavities provide a powerful platform to tailor their interactions with photons. Here we design a heterostructure consisting of optimized plasmonic nanocubes coupled to a WSe2 monolayer encapsulated between thin hexagonal boron nitride layers to unveil a new family of dark excitons. The emission from these dark excitons is 2,700 times stronger than bright excitons, yielding a striking enhancement factor of 3 × 105. We demonstrate the spin-forbidden nature of these dark states by studying their magneto-optical response. Furthermore, we selectively activate them by controlling the Fermi level via electric doping. Prominent features of these dark excitons include narrow linewidths, long lifetime, efficient electrical and magnetic modulation. Our findings unlock the potential for exploring exciton physics in two-dimensional materials using photonic heterostructures that preserve the intrinsic optical properties of two-dimensional materials in the coupling process. The demonstrated on-site control and ease of integration with passive photonic components make this platform particularly compelling for nanophotonic and sensing applications.

Spatiotemporal gating in signal transduction and corresponding activation or inhibition of a biochemical pathway is the hallmark of biological functionality. Herein, through both experimental and computational approaches, we developed a synthetic system to mimic one of the key biological signaling events - local inhibition and distal (long-range) activation (LIDA). The basis of our system lies in the differential diffusivity of – (i) injected dormant activator or pro-activator (Pro-A, urea, fast to diffuse due to non-binding with nanoparticle (NP) in gel matrix) that converts to activator (A, ammonium bicarbonate) via an enzyme (urease) embedded in the hydrogel) and (ii) inhibitor (IN, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), diffusion restricted due to interaction with NP). Here A and IN act as the activator and inhibitor of a base-catalyzed proton transfer reaction in the gel matrix, respectively. The indispensability of ProA to A conversion during diffusion for efficient time-regulated LIDA effect has also been demonstrated. The ability to input spatial gating of pH and reaction activation can potentially be extrapolated to develop neuromorphic self-assembled systems with distal programmability.

Differential diffusivity of activators and inhibitors in a signaling system is one of the fundamental aspects for the spatiotemporal regulation of biological processes1,2,3. In 1952, Alan Turing described the importance of reaction-diffusion (RD) phenomenon for pattern formation in biology4. Since then, researchers have realized the importance of RD of biological signaling molecules in processes ranging from embryonic to organ development, NOTCH signaling pathway, localized neuronal response etc.5,6,7,8. In general, pattern formation in biological organisms has been elucidated through the Turing model, where at least two interacting and diffusing species are involved. Here, a short-range activator is autocatalytic along with a long-range inhibitor that suppresses the activation effect, resulting in limitless number of distribution patterns with two species2. In 1960s, Burnett proposed a long-range activator-cum-inhibitor model using Hydra as a model system for demonstrating its distinct head-foot end and regeneration of the head at a different location9. Subsequently in 1972, Gierer and Meinhardt categorically demonstrated different pattern polarity (along with site variability) using activator-inhibitor-based model from a source of different density, gradient and position. Here the inhibitor is faster diffusing species than the activator and initially activator and inhibitor are equally distributed10. To this end, in 1969, Wolpert proposed the seminal concept of the positional information of a cell in a morphogen gradient governs the fate of the embryonic cell during the developmental process (also known as the French flag problem)11,12. Recent reports suggest biological RD phenomenon involving short-range inhibitor and long-range activator in cases like - embryonic development for distinguishing germ layers, retrograde signaling in the nervous system, and organelles inside cells, etc.13,14,15.

Inspired by biological pattern formation, scientists are also inclined in developing reaction-diffusion based models and systems, due to their manifold applications in diverse areas, ranging from - understanding biological morphogenesis to disease spread and to the designing of dynamic and spatially resolved (bio)materials for cell growth or sensors16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25. Usually, a hydrogel matrix is used for achieving different patterns via the differential self-assembly ability or diffusion of different components26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34. Employing original and modified Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction, researchers developed different kinds of Turing-like patterns in gel matrix, Liesegang pattern using nanoparticles, controlled one-dimensional gradient pattern of supramolecular assembly etc.26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38. Additionally, diverse complex (bio)chemical reaction network-based RD systems were developed to mimic biological processes and to generate programmable or patterned soft matters and actuators39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46. A recent report demonstrated an artificial developmental process by showing a French flag pattern-based colloidal aggregation to autonomously structure a soft material via DNA-based bistable reaction networks47.

In many cases, the addition of templating agent results in localized assembly by attracting a diffusive current of non-assembled molecules from surroundings48,49,50,51. This process eventually enhanced the formation of supramolecular assembly as well as associated properties like – signal generation and catalysis. In general, the desired assembly or associated enhancement in functionality resulting from RD processes takes place locally i.e. at the source point of chemical or energy input48,49,50. However, synthetic systems with short range inhibitor and long-range activator (where the desired functionality will be activated far from source input) are not reported so far to the best of our knowledge. Only in one instance, it has been shown that local addition of high concentration of catalytic inhibitor can enhance the activity at distant place after diffusion as the inhibitor acts as an activator at low concentration52. Although this is an elegant system, it is low in complexity and is based on only one diffusing species, whereas biological system specifically uses multiple reacting and diffusing species. It is worth mentioning that creating a synthetic RD system with local inhibition and distal activation (LIDA) will benefit the repertoire of synthetic systems that mimic natural spatiotemporal signaling pathways which possess precise temporal and positional information. Such a system might also have potential in the bottom-up development of complex chemical synthetic system with neuromorphic behavior. Therefore, the realization of complex chemical RD-based systems with spatiotemporally correlated output signals as a function of input information is one of the essential requirements for mimicking neuromorphic behavior in synthetic chemical systems53,54. This would be of importance to the development of complex pattern-based recognition systems, meta-gels, dynamic soft materials for diverse material and bioengineering applications55.

In this work, we develop a chemoenzymatic reaction-diffusion-based synthetic system to exhibit LIDA effect which is an important aspect of biological signal transmission. Using a combination of experimental and computational approaches, we demonstrate this LIDA effect in a hydrogel by injecting urea and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) at the center of the gel matrix. The experimental set up and detailed discussions has been given in Fig. 1 and in subsequent section. We show a base catalyzed reaction is activated by a combination of faster diffusion of urea and product of urease reaction at the distant zone from the injection center. Also, the reaction is locally suppressed by slow diffusion of ATP (due to binding with gold nanoparticles in the gel matrix). We experimentally demonstrated that reaction activation can be spatiotemporally gated by changing the amount of injected urea and ATP ratio. We also develop a computational model for the validation of the experimental results and a general platform (with varied enzymatic catalysis, reaction rates and diffusion parameters of the components) for future development of such systems.

a Reaction scheme with involved species and b reaction-diffusion event after injection of ProA and IN at a point. Here, distant zone becomes basic in pH due to enzymatic conversion of ProA to A, resulting in activation of Kemp Elimination reaction (i.e., conversion of NBI (R) to CNP (P)). Due to the presence of acidic inhibitor in the nearby zone, the reaction is suppressed. Slower diffusion of IN in the gel is due to binding with nanoparticles embedded in gel. c Schematic of the reaction set up with components (urea as ProA and ATP as IN) and reaction schemes. At the empty circular zone (5 mm diameter) aqueous solution of (ATP + urea) or (ATP + NH4HCO3) were added and allowed to diffuse into the agarose gel matrix (0.75 wt%). Experiment with the addition of (ATP as IN + NH4HCO3 as A) has been done as control experiment, to check the direct effect of A + IN. Blue and red arrow indices faster and slower diffusion of urea and ATP through gel matrix, due to non-binding and binding of GNP, respectively. The gel is embedded with CTAB-capped GNP (0.2 nM), urease enzyme (15 nM) and NBI (0.5 mM).

Our chemoenzymatic RD system is based on a catalytic hydrogel matrix with a reaction-diffusion system (Fig. 1). As mentioned in the preceding section, we aimed in activating a reaction spatially distant from the region of addition of inputs. We chose a base-catalyzed proton-transfer ring-opening reaction (also known as Kemp Elimination (KE) reaction) for this purpose56,57,58,59. The substrate for KE reaction 5-nitrobenzisoxazole (NBI, denoted as R in the manuscript) was evenly distributed in the agarose gel matrix. This R is converted to 2-cyanonitrophenol (CNP, denoted as P) in presence of a base and the reaction gets catalyzed by cationic gold nanoparticle (GNP)56,57. Therefore, the hydrogel was also embedded with GNP. Notably, in ultrapure water (with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ·cm at 25 °C), GNP does not catalyze the conversion of R to P. An enzyme, urease (E), is also present in the gel matrix that does not react with R or GNP. E can convert a neutral molecule, urea (dormant activator or pro-activator, ProA) to a base, ammonium bicarbonate (activator, A). We named urea and ammonium bicarbonate as ProA and A, respectively as A can activate the conversion of R to P and A formed only after the enzymatic action over ProA37. As we aimed to develop a LIDA-based system, we chose an anionic molecule, ATP as inhibitor (IN) of the KE reaction. We locally injected a mixture of ProA (urea) and IN (ATP) to achieve our desired system with local or short-range inhibition and distal or long-range activation.

The reasons behind choosing ATP as IN and urea as ProA are following – (i) due to acidic nature of ATP, it is known to suppress KE reaction, and thereby, it acts as a very good inhibitor for this process. Secondly, for local inhibition, IN needs to be slow to diffuse. In our case, ATP is anionic and has a great ability to bind with cationic GNP (already embedded in gel matrix), therefore, due to binding, diffusion of IN will be restricted through the gel matrix. (ii) We chose urea as ProA. As it is neutral, it does not bind to GNP and diffuses faster than IN. Therefore, upon injecting a mixture of ProA and IN, enzymatic ProA to A conversion will take place even in a zone devoid of IN. Thus, in principle, R to P conversion will take place far away from the zone of injection of ProA and IN. However, there is always the question of whether adding A (instead of ProA) and IN would provide the same effect or not. To address this issue, we also performed control experiments both experimentally and theoretically to demonstrate that enzymatic conversion of ProA to A during diffusion is a pre-requisite for developing such a system in a well-defined manner.

For experimental verification of the above-mentioned hypothesis, we designed our system as shown in Figs. 1c and 2a. In a petri dish, agarose gel casting was performed by keeping the center with 5 mm diameter vacant. The height of the gel was 3 mm. In the vacant zone, a solution of ATP + urea or ATP + NH4HCO3 was added and allowed to diffuse through the gel matrix. The gel is also embedded with cationic CTAB-capped gold nanoparticles (GNP), urease (E) and NBI (R). We used 0.75 wt% agarose gel for all our experiments for the following reasons (Supplementary Fig. 1). We found at higher concentration of agarose gel (1 wt %) GNP gets aggregated which can decrease the NBI to CNP reaction rate and alter the diffusion behavior of ATP. The aggregation was checked by noting the ratio of absorbances A620/A520, where an increase in the ratio indicates more aggregated AuNPs60. Higher agarose concentrations create a gel with a smaller mesh size, which acts as a physical barrier to nanoparticle movement, resulting enhanced interparticle friction and clustering of nanoparticles61. In contrary, at lower agarose concentration (0.5 wt%), the time taken to complete gel formation (after dissolving agarose at 110 °C) was ~25–30 min, resulting in some background conversion of NBI to CNP, prior to the addition of any reagent at the center. Therefore, to balance both issues, we used 0.75 wt% agarose gel for our study, where GNP aggregation was negligible and gel formation was fast (~5 min). We would like to mention here that only after complete solid-like gel formation, the solution of ATP + urea or ATP + NH4HCO3 at the center was added. Additionally, while preparing gel, we did not use any salt solution, as salt like NaCl can result in GNP aggregation and inhibit the base-catalyzed NBI to CNP reaction (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Before proceeding to the experiment with gel matrix, we analyzed the system in aqueous solution (milli Q water). At first, we checked the binding of ATP and NH4HCO3 and non-binding of urea with cationic GNP surface via zeta potential measurement (Supplementary Fig. 3). Then we checked in the presence of urease, addition of urea indeed results in conversion of NBI to CNP and the time of reaction outcome depends on the amount of urea (Supplementary Fig. 4). In absence of urease, no reaction occurs, and reaction can get activated in presence of NH4HCO3 (Supplementary Fig. 5). It is worth mentioning that in our previous studies, we already demonstrated the catalytic ability of GNP for this KE reaction in urea-urease system33. We also showed that with increasing ATP content in the reaction system with urea-urease and NBI, the KE reaction rate can be significantly slowed down (Supplementary Fig. 4). For example, only 0.2 mM ATP can slow down the NBI to CNP conversion rate by 50% when 2 mM urea was used in presence of 15 nM urease. In a similar condition, upon checking the inhibitory effect of a simple salt NaCl, we found 10–15 mM NaCl is needed to decrease the production of CNP by 50% (Supplementary Fig. 2). In this case, weakly basic chloride ion can act as a competitor of basic HCO3- ion for binding with the cationic GNP surface to hinder the conversion of NBI to CNP. Using a pH probe, bromothymol blue (BTB), we established that with increasing ATP, the time required for acidic to basic transformation was increased, resulting in a delay of the base-catalyzed proton transfer reaction (Supplementary Fig. 6)56,62.

Now, for the gel experiment, we measured the formation of CNP at 8 different zones, each separated by 1 mm in a plate reader (please see experimental procedure in the methods section for details). First, we injected 40 μl volume of aqueous solution containing 50 mM urea and 5 mM ATP at the center and allowed it to diffuse through the hydrogel matrix (Figs. 1c and 2a). We then monitored the evolution of reaction product, P by following the absorbance at 380 nm wavelength over time at different points (Fig. 2b, c). Upon injecting 50 mM urea + 5 mM ATP at the center, we were pleased to observe that the formation of P did not happen near the injection center (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 7). Indeed, in this case, the maximum product was found 5 mm away from the center between 2 h to 5 h (Fig. 2e). For the initial 60 and 90 min data, we observed that the maximum product formation was taking place at zone 4 (4 mm away from center). Interestingly, while injecting 40 μl of 50 mM NH4HCO3 (product formed after urea-urease reaction) + 5 mM ATP at the center, the maximum reaction product formed in the very beginning at zone 3 (up to 60 min), and then the maximum product always formed at zone 2 (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. 8). Although in this case, the reaction rate was very high and the amount of product was almost equally distributed from zone 1 to zone 5, 6 and 8, after 1, 2 and 4 h, respectively, suggesting the difference in concentration is negligible and the product mostly formed near the injection center. We also performed an additional experiment with lower urea (25 mM) but with similar ATP of 5 mM. In this case, we found the maximum product forming zone was further away by 1 mm up to 90 min in comparison to 50 mM urea + 5 mM ATP case (Fig. 2e, Supplementary Fig. 9). At both 1 and 1.5 h, the maximum product formation was found at zone 5 which was maintained up to 5 h. Again, at fixed ATP (2.5 mM), and decreasing urea from 25 to 10 mM, the maximum product formation zone moved further away at zone 5, compared to zone 4 after 3 h (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Figs. 10, 11). These experiments clearly suggest the importance of injecting urea, instead of NH4HCO3 and enzymatic conversion of urea to NH4HCO3 during diffusion plays the key role in generating distant reaction product forming zone. Also decreasing the amount of urea injected at a fixed ATP concentration, resulted in the product formation zone moving further away from reaction center. However, at very low urea (10 mM), the amount of formed P was too low. We also performed control experiments without either urease or GNP or both in the gel matrix. In all these cases, the product formation was too low, indicating the requirement of both E and GNP for the reaction conversion (Supplementary Figs. 12–14). Next, we also checked the effect of addition of only urea in the system having GNP and urease in the gel matrix (Supplementary Fig. 15). Here also, the product formed maximally at zone 1 and diffused to other distant zones with time, showing the importance of ATP (IN) and conversion of urea (ProA) to basic ammonium ions (IN) during diffusion through gel matrix for LIDA-effect.

Measurements were taken in all directions. To avoid the error due to angular contribution, the average values of the four points (as shown in cross pattern in panel b) at the same distance were calculated and extrapolated to represent the entire circumference as circle (indicated by showing dotted circle to represent zone 1 (Z1), zone 4 (Z4) and zone 8 (Z8) in panel c). d Spatiotemporal pattern of product (CNP) formation when 40 µl of aqueous solution of 5 mM ATP and 50 mM urea (top panel) and 5 mM ATP + 50 mM NH4HCO3 (bottom panel) were injected at the central zone. The color map showed the CNP concentration at each zone. Herein, concentrations above 400 µM were shown as deep red and below 100 µM as deep blue. e The maximum product-forming zone away from the source at different time points was plotted for the injection of urea (25 mM) + ATP (5 mM), urea (50 mM) + ATP (5 mM), and NH4HCO3 (50 mM) + ATP (5 mM). The color of each symbol depicts the concentration range as shown in the color map (below 400 µM as deep blue and 500 µM as deep red). f Maximum product forming zone away from the source at different time points was plotted for injection of urea (25 mM) + ATP (2.5 mM) and urea (10 mM) + ATP (2.5 mM). The color of each symbol depicts the concentration range as shown in the color map. Data are presented as mean ± SD (where n  =  8). Source data are provided as a source data file.

The results discussed in the previous paragraph suggest that enzymatic conversion of ProA to A during diffusion is the essential factor for developing LIDA-based systems. Next, we were curious to find the reason behind this phenomenon. As KE is a base-catalyzed reaction, R to P conversion should occur at high pH. Therefore, we were interested to find out the spatiotemporal evolution of pH in the system after injection of 50 mM urea and 5 mM ATP. For this, bromothymol blue (BTB) dye was incorporated in the gel instead of NBI, along with GNP and E (Fig. 3a). At first, we calibrated the gel system at 620 nm wavelength with BTB dye using known pH value (Supplementary Fig. 16). It is worth mentioning that absorbance value at 620 nm increases with increasing pH. Interestingly, we find that the initial zones (up to 2 mm) near the injection center remain acidic (below pH 6) for about 60 min, whereas pH of zone 3 and 5, at 60 min were 7.2 and 8.1, respectively (Fig. 3b, c, Supplementary Figs. 17, 18). It clearly suggests that initially the pH remains low at the injection center but was higher at zone 4 and 5. Even after 180 min, we found pH of zone 1 was close to 7, whereas the value was 8 or higher for zone 4 onwards. As pH of the distant zone becomes higher quickly, the reaction starts at distal zones from the injection center (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Fig. 17). This also suggests that acidic ATP remains close to injection center, whereas urea moved faster and converted to basic NH4HCO3, even at distant zones to activate the KE reaction.

a Schematic of the reaction set up with components as described in Fig. 1c. In this case, pH probe Bromothymol blue (0.02 mM) was added in the gel instead of NBI. At the empty circular zone (5 mm diameter) aqueous solution of (ATP + urea) was added and allowed to diffuse to the agarose gel matrix (0.75 wt%). b A snapshot of petridish taken after 60 min, showing the initial zone is acidic (yellow color) and outer region is basic (blue color). c Spatiotemporal pattern of pH in the gel matrix with time when 40 µl of aqueous solution of 5 mM ATP and 50 mM urea was injected in the central zone. Blue indicates pH of 8 or higher and red indicates pH lower than 6. The pH of the whole gel before injection was around 5.6 as it was made with mQ water (which is slightly acidic due to dissolved CO2). d pH (blue points, left sided Y-axis) and product formation (orange points, right-sided Y-axis) with time at zone 1, zone 3 and zone 5. Data are presented as mean ± SD (where n  =  8). Source data are provided as a source data file.

After establishing the system experimentally, we were interested to explore the spatiotemporal emergence of the reaction product at different diffusion parameters, activation and inhibition constant by developing a model system. This will be of importance for further understanding the present system and how to build similar LIDA-type synthetic system, with chemical components of different diffusivity and catalytic properties. This model simulates a two-dimensional reaction-diffusion system involving six chemical species undergoing transport and/or enzymatic reactions. The system is defined in polar coordinates \((r,\,\theta )\) over a circular domain, and it accounts for both radial and angular diffusion (Fig. 4). E and R are embedded in a circular reaction matrix. ProA and IN are injected at the center and allowed to diffuse and react. We also performed control experiments with only A instead of ProA to see the difference in spatiotemporal reaction pattern.

a Scheme of the reactions used for modeling. Here similar dimensions of two-dimensional circular disc (8 mm diameter) as used in experiment were chosen. b Spatiotemporal distribution of reaction product (P) at different kIN/kA and different diffusion coefficient ratios of ProA, IN and A when ProA (50 mM) and IN (5 mM) are injected at the center (left) and A (50 mM) and IN (5 mM) are injected at the center (right). The maximum product concentration (normalized) obtained in both ProA + IN and A + IN cases are given in Supplementary Table 1. Product distribution when kIN/kA = 103, and DProA:DIN:DA = 40: 1: 1, 40: 2: 2, 40: 5: 5 and 40: 8: 8 (where DProA = 4 × 10−10 m2/s) for c ProA + IN injection and d A + IN injection at the center at 150 min. Notably, product concentration in the case of A + IN injection is higher than ProA + IN injection. For (b–d), the concentration of product was normalized with respect to the maximum product concentration obtained for the case of kIN/kA = 103 and DProA:DIN:DA = 40:2:2 at 150 min.

The governing reaction-diffusion is described by partial differential equations (PDE) of the form:

Where \(i\) is the appropriate chemical species ProA, A, I or P. \({C}_{i}\) is the concentration of the chemical species \(i\). \({D}_{i}\) is the diffusion coefficient. \({R}_{i}(C)\) represents the reaction term. A constant concentration of enzyme (E) in the matrix is assumed.

The reaction terms for: ProA → A (Michaelis-Menten equation) and R → P conversions are given in Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively.

Where \({R}_{0}\) is the initial concentration of the reactant, NBI.

In Eq. (4), kA and kIN are rate constant of A-induced activation and IN-mediated inhibition (see supplementary information for detailed derivation of Eq. (4)). Central Finite Difference Approximations are used for spatial derivatives. Neumann boundary condition (no-flux) is imposed at the center and domain boundary. A circular disc of 8 mm diameter has been chosen to follow the reaction-diffusion phenomenon, and we followed the RD system until 150 min. At first, we checked the spatiotemporal emergence of the final product P in different ratio of kIN and kA (kIN / kA = 1, 103 and 106) while adding a mixture of 50 mM ProA and 5 mM IN at the center of the circular disc. Additionally, we checked 4 different diffusion ratio of ProA, A and IN (DProA: DIN: DA = 40: 1: 1; 40: 2: 2; 40: 5: 5 and 40: 8: 8) (Fig. 4, Supplementary Figs. 19–30). Here, we assumed DProA = 4 × 10−10 m2/s (considering diffusion co-efficient of urea) and kcat/KM = 3000 mM−1s−1 (kcat = 104 s−1, KM = 3.3 mM) for enzyme urease towards substrate urea63. For screening of the simulation parameters we assume both IN and A has similar diffusion co-efficient as both can bind with GNP. The diameter of GNP is around 25 nm; therefore, we assumed that bound IN and A would be of similar diffusion co-efficient with a much lower value than ProA. Additionally, we did not consider any diffusivity of P. Simultaneously, we checked the scenario when instead of ProA, we added 50 mM A (directly added without allowing it to form through enzymatic reaction) and 5 mM IN with similar kinetic and diffusion parameters (Fig. 4, Supplementary Figs. 31–42). From the theoretical plot, we can observe a trade-off between diffusion ratio and kIN/kA. In general, for kIN/kA of 103 a clear LIDA effect was observed at all ratios of diffusion coefficients studied in this work. However, the amount of P steadily decreased with increasing diffusion of IN. After 150 min, the highest LIDA was observed in the case of kIN/kA of 106, with DProA: DIN: DA = 40: 2: 2, although the product amount was lower than the case when kIN/kA was 103. Similarly, the system will be effective for DProA: DIN: DA = 40: 5: 5 or 40: 8: 8 cases quite efficiently when kIN/kA equals 103, but not with kIN/kA of 106. In fact, we were pleased to observe while injecting only A = 50 mM and IN = 5 mM at the center, and DIN = DA (1:1), the product always formed close to the injection center and the amount of product was higher than the case when (ProA + IN) was injected (Fig. 4b–d, Supplementary Table 1).

After analyzing the above data, we fixed DProA: DIN: DA = 40: 2: 2 and kIN/kA to 103 to explore the spatiotemporal emergent behavior of P with different concentration ratios of ProA and IN injection at the center. This model output is comparable to our observed experimental result (Supplementary Figs. 43, 44). We fixed the amount of IN to 5 mM and decreased the amount of ProA to 25 and 10 mM. In this case we found that, with low ProA (10 mM), maximum P emerged at a distant zone (3 mm away from the center) beforehand (in terms of time) than in the other two cases (Supplementary Fig. 45). In a similar manner we fixed the amount of ProA to 50 mM and found that, with increasing IN, maximum P was formed at a distant zone at earlier time point compared to low IN (Supplementary Fig. 46). Lower ProA or higher IN results in enhanced inhibition, therefore, maximum product was found at more distant zone. However, with high IN or low ProA, the amount of product is low and in some cases, negligible. Both simulations are similar to our experimentally observed scenario described at Fig. 2f to a considerable extent. Again, while using only (A + IN) injection, the maximum product forming zone remains same irrespective of the concentration and no concentration effect over spatiotemporal variation was observed (Supplementary Fig. 47).

At this point, we asked ourselves, in the development of LIDA type system, what is the benefit of including ProA to A conversion and higher diffusion co-efficient of ProA compared to IN? In fact, one might think that this system could be developed using a faster diffusing A and slower diffusing IN. We tested this by simulating the A + IN system, assuming DA to be greater than DIN. The model simulated conditions when DIN:DA = 1:40, 2:40, 5:40 and 8:40 at kIN/kA = 1, 103 and 106, with the amount of A and IN being 50 mM and 5 mM respectively (fixed DA = 4 × 10−10 m2/s) (Supplementary Figs. 48–59). The resulting plot of P concentration over time shows that P formation was concentrated in the central zone, near the injection point at all diffusion coefficient ratios at kIN/kA = 1. At kIN/kA = 103, maximum concentration of P was found at zone 3 at all ratios of DIN:DA. P formation in the case of kIN/kA = 106 was maximum at distal zones (zone 5, 6), although the maximum concentration of P was lowest here, out of the three kIN/kA cases tested (Supplementary Fig. 60). With faster diffusion of IN, the zone where maximum P is observed moves further away from the site of injection. And higher kIN/kA value shows stronger inhibition in the central zones. Although LIDA can be observed in this case, the addition of ProA to A reaction gives greater spatiotemporal control over the system, even after considering ProA converted A has similar diffusivity to IN. To prove this, we compared these results with the earlier case of ProA + IN at various ratios of diffusion coefficients and kIN/kA (Supplementary Fig. 61). While the concentration of P is lower in the case of ProA + IN, the zone of maximum P formation is consistently farther away than the case with A + IN at least by 1 mm in each case. This is applicable at all ratios of diffusion coefficients and kIN/kA. We also compared P output pattern for two different situations, DProA: DIN: DA = 40:2:5 and 40:2:20 with DIN: DA = 2:5 and 2:20 cases (Supplementary Fig. 62). Here we found that addition of ProA results shifting of maximum P formation zone by 1–2 mm distance compared to A + IN case with different spatiotemporal manner. Overall, the results show the LIDA effect is even more effective while using ProA and its conversion to A during diffusion, even when A has higher diffusivity than IN.

One other advantage of having ProA is that temporal control can be achieved by modifying the reaction parameters of ProA to A. We simulated cases where we modified the kcat/kM ratio to increase or decrease by 10- and 100-fold (at a range of five orders of magnitudes from 30 to 300000 mM−1s−1) (Supplementary Figs. 63–68). The point of time when the desired concentration of P is observed in the system is tracked. The results show that temporal control of this RD system can be achieved by modifying reaction kinetics of ProA to A reaction. This temporal control would not be possible in a simple system with only two diffusing species as shown in A + IN case and therefore, validating the necessity of reaction-diffusion for more distinct LIDA with manifold spatiotemporal diversity.

So far, we have not considered the pH sensitivity of urease reactivity. Urease activity followed a bell-shaped curve where at pH 7 enzyme showed its highest activity. In our experiment, we found that the initial zones remain acidic due to presence of ATP, whereas outer zone has higher pH (data demonstrated in Fig. 3). Indeed, upon measuring ammonia production rate during urease-urea reaction, we also found that with increasing ATP concentration urease reactivity decreased (Supplementary Table S3). Here pH of the system is also decreasing with increasing ATP.

For modeling pH-dependent urease activity, a Gaussian curve centered at pH 7 (enzyme's optimal pH) was used as previously shown by Straube et al.64. The experimentally measured pH values at each of the 8 zones over time are associated with the equivalent radial zones of the model at the specified time points (Supplementary Table 3). Zone 0, representing the central cavity is assigned a pH value of 3.7 to represent its acidic nature due to presence of 5 mM ATP. For each zone, the pH data is interpolated over the experimental time range using the ‘interp1d' function of Python, so that the local pH can be looked up at any simulation moment for each radial position.

The pH in each zone determines the enzyme activity factor (activity_factor variable in code ProA+I – with pH dependence.py), a scalar between 0 and 1. This value then multiplies the catalytic reaction term (reaction_AB variable in the code) in the model equations, thus controlling how efficiently the substrate is converted into the product based on the local pH. Therefore, this model accurately captures the spatial and temporal progression of the reaction system, considering the effect of pH on urease activity. In this case we also considered diffusion of P which is similar to IN and A (DProA: DIN: DA: DP = 40: 2: 2: 2). The simulation result is given in Supplementary Fig. 69. In this case also a clear LIDA effect was observed for ProA + IN case compared to A + IN injected scenario with a factor of 1–2 mm.

In summary, firstly, we experimentally demonstrated a complex chemoenzymatic system to gain control over catalysis at a spatially distant zone in a time-dependent manner. This reaction-diffusion system primarily relied on supramolecular interaction-based diffusion control and both enzymatic and nanoparticle surface-mediated catalysis. This demonstration will be important in the future development of chemical systems that aim to regulate the onset of chemical reactions both spatially and temporally65,66,67,68,69,70. Notably, our approach is entirely different for modulating chemical reactions at the far-off site from the injection point. We also designed a theoretical model to rationalize the experimental facts. We further analyzed the benefits of injecting (dormant activator + inhibitor) together rather than (activator + inhibitor) both in terms of gaining efficient spatial gating of the reaction activation zone from the injection center and temporal control via tuning the enzymatic rate of conversion of activator from dormant activator during diffusion. Overall, pH enhancement and corresponding reaction activation region in the gel matrix can be spatiotemporally gated by the enzymatic conversion rate of ProA to A and initial source concentration of ProA and IN. We believe both experimental and theoretical data presented in this manuscript will be important for the advancement of synthetic reaction-diffusion systems to achieve spatiotemporally diverse chemical signaling pathways via modulating chemical inputs, their interaction parameters and directions of reaction propagation ability with surrounding environmental precursors (for example in presence of ions)71,72,73. One can also envision the utility of this approach from the triggering of spatially distant self-assembly and positional information based chemical events akin to artificial developmental program for the construction of more complex chemical neural networks47,74.

All commercially available reagents were procured and used without any further purification. Ascorbic acid, Bromothymol Blue, Cetyltrimethylammonium Bromide, Sodium Borohydride, Urea, and Urease (UR) were purchased from Sisco Research Laboratory (SRL), India. Adenosine Triphosphate Disodium Salt, Gold (III) Chloride (HAuCl4.3H2O), 1,2-Benzisoxazole, and Sephadex G-25 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Agarose powder was purchased from Himedia.

For performing the Kemp Elimination reaction, the substrate 5-nitrobenzisoxazole (NBI) was synthesized by nitration of 1,2-benzisoxazole and its product 2-cyano-4-nitrophenol (CNP) was synthesized by base hydrolysis of NBI by following the previously reported procedure as discussed below58,75.

NBI synthesis: 0.4 g of 1,2-Benzisoxazole was dissolved in 5 ml concentrated H2SO4 at room temperature. After slowly adding 0.5 ml of a mixture of conc. HNO3 (0.5 ml) and conc. H2SO4 (0.2 ml) to the above solution, it was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was then slowly poured into a 20 ml ice-water mixture, followed by stirring for 10 min. The white precipitate obtained was filtered, washed with cold ethanol and the solvent was dried under a high vacuum. The product was recrystallized in absolute ethanol and a white, crystalline solid was obtained. Yield: 80%.

CNP synthesis: 3 ml of 2 M NaOH were added to a solution containing 0.1 g of 5-nitrobenzisoxazole in 2 ml ethanol and 1 ml water, and the mixture was left to stand for 10 min. Then in order to raise the mixture's pH to 1, HCl was gradually added. Dichloromethane was used to extract the solution, and a vacuum was used to evaporate the solvent. A bright yellow solid was obtained by air-drying the product. Yield: 70%.

For calculating CNP concentration, in aqueous solution after UV-vis kinetics, molar extinction co-efficient value of 16,000 M−1cm−1 was considered57,58.

Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) were synthesized using the seed growth method as described in previously reported literature56. Briefly, 3.75 ml of 100 mM CTAB solution was mixed with 0.052 ml of 24 mM HAuCl4.4H2O to create a seed solution. This was followed by the addition of 1.2 ml of freshly made 25 mM ice-cold sodium borohydride solution, which produced a brown solution that showed the development of gold seeds. For the growth solution, 6.25 ml of 4.0 mM HAuCl4.4H2O solution was mixed with 10 ml of 100 mM CTAB solution. Next, 7.5 ml of 100 mM L-ascorbic acid was added, and the mixture was gently shaken until it became colorless. After adding 62.5 µl of seed solution to the growth solution and vigorously stirring for 20 s, the creation of gold nanoparticles is indicated by the appearance of red. Finally, the resulting solution was left alone for 24 h at room temperature. For further purification it was then passed through a Sephadex G-25 column, containing 0.5 g of Sephadex G-25 swelled in Milli-Q water.

Hydrodynamic diameters (Dh) and zeta potentials of the GNP were measured using Horiba Scientific NanoParticle Observer (SZ-100V2).

Urease activity was measured experimentally using the salicylate-hypochlorite method as discussed in earlier literature76. For the urea-urease (UU) reaction, 50 mM urea and 15 nM of urease were used. 20 µl of UU reaction solution at different time points (t = 0, 5, 10 and 15 min) was added to sodium salicylate, sodium hypochlorite and trisodium phosphate with the final concentration of 250 mM, 50 mM and 100 mM respectively in a sequential manner. The final volume of the solution was 500 µl. This solution was heated at 50 °C for 1 hour after which the spectrum was recorded. A calibration curve was made by plotting absorbance at 640 nm against concentration (50, 100, 250, 500, 750 and 1000 µM) of ammonium bicarbonate as standard. From this plot, the concentration of the ammonia product from UU reaction was determined. Please see Supplementary Table 3 for the data.

The theoretical simulations were modeled using ‘solve_ivp' function of SciPy library in Python. The detailed equations are given in the supplementary information. The Github link for codes used to perform the simulation has been mentioned in ‘code availability' section.

For modeling pH-dependent urease activity, a Gaussian curve centered at pH 7 (enzyme's optimal pH) was used as previously shown by Straube et al.64.

22.5 mg agarose powder was dissolved in 3 ml of milliQ water by heating at 110 °C in a heating block. Then, the dissolved agarose gel was poured into a petri dish with a diameter of 35 mm by placing a cylindrical tube with a diameter of 5 mm at the center of the petri dish and was allowed to cool down at room temperature. This allowed the dissolved agarose powder to polymerize into a rigid yet porous hydrogel matrix. For preparing the GNP amalgamated agarose hydrogel, GNP was added to the dissolved agarose solution (by cooling it to around 55 °C) before pouring it into the petri dish. Hydrogels containing GNP + NBI, GNP + NBI + UR, GNP + BTB, GNP + BTB + UR, NBI + UR, and BTB + UR were synthesized following a similar procedure by keeping the final concentrations of GNP, NBI, UR, and BTB at 200 pM, 0.5 mM, 15 nM, and 30 µM, respectively.

To measure the Kemp elimination reaction and pH change in different zones in the hydrogel, the as-prepared hydrogel was placed inside a PolarStar Omega plate reader. Then, a 40 µl volume of ProA (urea), IN (ATP), or a mixture of IN + ProA (in different ratios), or a mixture of IN + A was added into the hole at the center of the agarose gel, and absorbance values at various zones of hydrogel were recorded at different interval of time. For the Kemp elimination reaction, absorbance values were recorded at 380 nm wavelength, whereas for pH change, absorbance values were recorded at 620 nm with matrix scanning (well scanning) mode, keeping the scan matrix dimension 23 × 23, scan width 23 mm. Then, for convenience, four points from each zone (highlighted with red color in Fig. 2b) were taken as the average value for the respective zone. All the experiments were performed twice, and the average value of 2 measurements for each zone was plotted in circular form as shown in Fig. 2a of the main manuscript. Here, each zone is separated by 1 mm, and the outermost 1 mm was excluded to avoid the boundary effect. All the experimental data are averages of 3 experiments. The absorbance value coming from only gel without CNP was subtracted in each case. For converting absorbance to CNP concentration, a calibration plot with known CNP-containing agarose gel (embedded with GNP and urease) was conducted (Supplementary Fig. 70). For pH determination, the calibration curve given at Supplementary Fig. 16 was used. Two independent experiments were performed in each case. Therefore, 8 datapoints were used to calculate the average KE product formation or pH value.

For theoretical data, the concentration of product was normalized with respect to the maximum product concentration obtained for the case of kIN/kA = 103 and DProA:DIN:DA = 40:2:2 at 150 min in the entire manuscript including supplementary information (Fig. 4c).

An international group of scientists has confirmed the discovery of three Earth-sized planets within the binary stellar system known as TOI-2267, located roughly 190 light-years from Earth. The finding, published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, offers new insight into how planets can form and remain stable in double-star systems, which were once thought too chaotic for complex planetary development.

"Our analysis shows a unique planetary arrangement: two planets are transiting one star, and the third is transiting its companion star," explains Sebastián Zúñiga-Fernández, a researcher at the University of Liège (ULiège) and first author of the paper. "This makes TOI-2267 the first binary system known to host transiting planets around both of its stars."

A Compact and Unusual Double-Star System

TOI-2267 consists of two stars locked in a close orbital dance, forming what astronomers call a compact binary system. Such systems create gravitational forces that typically disrupt planet formation. Despite this, researchers have detected three Earth-sized planets in tight orbits, a surprising outcome that challenges long-held theories about where rocky worlds can exist.

"Our discovery breaks several records, as it is the most compact and coldest pair of stars with planets known, and it is also the first in which planets have been recorded transiting around both components," says Francisco J. Pozuelos, a co-leader of the study and researcher at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (IAA-CSIC).

Combining Space and Ground Observations

NASA's TESS space telescope first provided the data leading to this discovery. Two of the planets were initially identified by astronomers at ULiège and IAA-CSIC using their custom software tool, SHERLOCK. This early detection prompted ground-based observations to confirm the findings.

The confirmation process required a major effort involving several observatories. Among the most important were the SPECULOOS and TRAPPIST telescopes operated by ULiège (PI: Michaël Gillon). Designed to detect small exoplanets around cool, dim stars, these robotic instruments were vital for verifying the planets and studying their characteristics in detail.

A Natural Testbed for Planet Formation

"Discovering three Earth-sized planets in such a compact binary system is a unique opportunity," says Zúñiga-Fernández. "It allows us to test the limits of planet formation models in complex environments and to better understand the diversity of possible planetary architectures in our galaxy."

Pozuelos adds, "This system is a true natural laboratory for understanding how rocky planets can emerge and survive under extreme dynamical conditions, where we previously thought their stability would be compromised."

Looking Ahead to Future Exploration

The discovery opens up new questions about how planets form and persist in binary systems. Upcoming observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and next-generation ground-based observatories could reveal more details, such as the planets' masses, densities, and even their atmospheric compositions.

Beyond its scientific importance, the finding underscores the value of combining data from space-based observatories like TESS with precise ground-based instruments such as SPECULOOS and TRAPPIST. Together, they continue to expand our understanding of how planetary systems form and evolve across the galaxy.

The rules for the 2025 version of the influential Highly Cited Researchers list exclude scientists whose co-authors have engaged in practices such as a tendency to cite their own papers. Credit: Getty

The creators of an influential list of highly cited researchers have shaken up their methodology this year, taking a swipe at scientists who associate with those linked to possible ethical breaches. The new rules have allowed the field of mathematics to return to the list, after being excluded for the past two years owing to concerns over suspicious citation patterns.

The Highly Cited Researchers (HCR) list is produced by the multinational data-analytics company Clarivate, which also owns the Web of Science database. The list aims to recognize contemporary researchers with “significant and broad influence”, who are among the authors of papers that are in the top 1% in their field by number of citations. The programme recognizes thousands of individuals each year across 21 natural- and social-science fields and factors into influential rankings of universities.

Thousands of highly cited scientists have at least one retraction

Thousands of highly cited scientists have at least one retraction

This year, the list was compiled with a new step: exclusion of any papers with an author who had been knocked off the previous year's HCR list owing to research-integrity issues. This means that anyone who routinely co-authored papers with someone who'd been excluded in the previous year was less likely to be acknowledged than before the change.

“It's quite a good idea. It's a big cleaning,” says Lauranne Chaignon, a bibliometrician at PSL University in Paris, who has studied the HCR list1. There is, she adds, a small chance of removing a deserving scientist.

This year's list, announced today, recognizes 6,868 people.

Starting around 2016, HCR organizers noticed a rise in suspicious activity in the data used to compile the list, says David Pendlebury, head of research analysis at Clarivate's Institute for Scientific Information (ISI). The issue became most pronounced in maths: a few people were publishing large numbers of papers, especially in the field of fractional differential equations. These authors frequently cited each other, causing others to fall off the HCR list. “A lot of these people were not known to us, and they were from institutions sometimes we'd never heard of,” says Pendlebury. “The world-famous mathematicians that we originally were seeing were disappearing.”

Maths is particularly vulnerable to gaming because its metrics are small: mathematicians tend to publish fewer papers with fewer co-authors and citations than do academics in other fields2. “Just a few more citations into the system is quite disruptive,” says Pendlebury. As a result, Clarivate chose to omit the field entirely from the 2023 and 2024 lists.

The process of constructing the HCR list starts with a ‘long list' of about 200,000 papers and reviews that are in the top 1% in their field by citation count. The ISI team then whittles this down by removing retracted papers and those with more than 30 authors (on which it's hard to determine individual contributions), for example.

In a surprise Wednesday drop, Bellevue, Wash.-based Valve Software unveiled three new physical gaming devices intended to work with its digital storefront Steam.

Planned for release in early 2026, the devices are described as new parts of the “Steam Hardware family.” They include the Steam Machine, a small console intended for users' living rooms; the Steam Frame, a lightweight VR headset; and a new Steam Controller, which features several new interfaces similar to those found on Valve's Steam Deck.

“We've been super happy with the success of Steam Deck, and PC gamers have continued asking for even more ways to play all the great titles in their Steam libraries,” Gabe Newell, president of Valve, said in a press release.

“Our work over the years on other hardware and even more importantly on SteamOS has enabled Steam Controller, Steam Machine, and Steam Frame to do just that,” Newell said.

The Steam Machine is a 6-inch cube that's designed to fit unobtrusively into a living room or entertainment center. It's intended to quietly and efficiently run games from your Steam library, with a removable front panel for decorative purposes and an LED so users can readily tell when it's on or off.

Like the Steam Deck, the Steam Machine runs on a Linux-based operating system that's built around Steam. If plugged into a monitor and keyboard, it can be used as a standalone PC with a KDE Plasma desktop environment.

The Steam Frame is a standalone virtual reality headset that's reportedly able to stream any game from users' Steam library, with full controller input. It's a PC in its own right, so it can be used by itself, rather than having to be hooked up to a desktop.

Finally, the Steam Controller “shares DNA” with the Steam Deck, and is described by Valve as “high-performance” and “ergonomic,” with magnetic thumbsticks, trackpads, a gyroscope, and buttons on the grips. In addition to being designed for the Steam Machine, the Steam Controller is compatible with PCs and laptops.

Valve's announcement on Wednesday came roughly 10 minutes after a series of rumors and leaks that went viral in the PC gaming community, apparently spurred by an accidental release by one of Valve's partner companies.

No announcements were made regarding exact release dates or prices for any of the devices, but Valve did state it hopes to share those details after the first of the year.

This is a full-circle move for Valve, which had previously attempted to break into both the controller and living room markets with similar devices. Previous editions of both the Steam Controller and Steam Machine were released in 2015 and discontinued in 2019. Valve still sells its high-end Valve Index VR system, which first came out in 2019, though it's out of stock at time of writing.

This is a seemingly strange time for Valve to revisit its hardware divisions, but the Steam Deck's success seems to have reignited its ambition to reshape the face of PC gaming. Newell has been vocal for years about how he believes Windows is a poor environment for computer games, and Valve has made a number of moves in recent memory that all come back to trying to expand Linux's presence in the scene. Through that lens, the new 2026 Steam Machine in particular seems like another quiet shot across Microsoft's bow.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

Microsoft says it has linked massive data centers in Wisconsin and Atlanta — roughly 700 miles and five states apart — through a high-speed fiber-optic network to operate as a unified system.

The announcement Wednesday morning marks the debut of what the company is calling its AI “superfactory,” a new class of data centers built specifically for artificial intelligence. The facilities are designed to train and run advanced AI models across connected sites — a setup that Microsoft describes as the world's first “planet-scale AI superfactory.”

Unlike traditional cloud data centers that run millions of separate applications for different customers, Microsoft says the new facilities are designed to handle single, massive AI workloads across multiple sites. Each data center houses hundreds of thousands of Nvidia GPUs connected through a high-speed architecture known as an AI Wide Area Network, or AI-WAN, to share computing tasks in real time.

Microsoft says it's using a new two-story data center design to pack GPUs more densely and minimize latency, a strategy enabled in part by a closed-loop liquid cooling system.

By linking sites across regions, the company says it's able to pool computing capacity, redirect workloads dynamically, and distribute the massive power requirements across the grid so that it isn't dependent on available energy resources in one part of the country.

This unified supercomputer will train and run the next generation of AI models for key partners such as OpenAI, and for Microsoft's own internal models.

The new approach shows the rapid pace of the AI infrastructure race among the world's largest tech companies. Microsoft spent more than $34 billion on capital expenditures in its most recent quarter — much of it on data centers and GPUs — to keep up with what it sees as soaring AI demand.

Amazon is taking a similar approach with its new Project Rainier complex in Indiana, a cluster of seven data center buildings spanning more than 1,200 acres. Meta, Google, OpenAI and Anthropic are making similar multibillion-dollar bets, collectively putting hundreds of billions into new facilities, chips, and systems to train and deploy AI models.

Some analysts and investors see echoes of a tech bubble in the rush to build AI infrastructure, if business customers don't realize enough value from AI in the near term. Microsoft, Amazon and others say the demand is real, not speculative, pointing to long-term contracts as evidence.

Story corrected at 11:30 a.m. PT to accurately reflect Microsoft's announcements about which companies will have AI models trained in the facilities.

Huawei accelerators gain traction as Chinese cloud giants retrain away from Nvidia silicon.

Restrictions on U.S. chip exports are beginning to force visible shifts in China's AI compute strategy, as a shortage of Nvidia accelerators drives cloud providers toward domestic alternatives. According to new reporting by The Wall Street Journal, supply has become tight enough that government officials are now overseeing allocation of remaining high-end parts, prioritizing homegrown options like Huawei's Ascend series for training and inference workloads.

The impact is reportedly most visible in China's public cloud and state-funded data center projects, which are now formally barred from using foreign AI chips. The directive follows earlier efforts by Beijing to promote domestic hardware through subsidies and procurement preference, but the latest guidance is more absolute. Chinese developers are rewriting code and restructuring workloads to run on domestic accelerators like Huawei's Ascend 910B and 910C, as a result, which are less powerful than Nvidia's latest GPUs.

As for the Ascend 910C, it's emerging as a default choice. An updated version of the company's 910B, the 910C combines two 910B dies in one package and reportedly began mass shipments this spring. Multiple Chinese developers are thought to already be using it for model training, making it the first domestic chip deployed at this scale for large-scale AI.

Alibaba and Baidu, two of China's largest cloud providers, have begun shifting workloads to their in-house AI silicon as well. Baidu recently revealed a new version of its Baige training platform that runs entirely on Chinese-made hardware and software, designed to keep its product road map moving without access to the latest Nvidia parts.

Meanwhile, others are trying to work around supply chains. Some Chinese companies have routed training runs through overseas subsidiaries, while others are relying on second-hand or refurbished Nvidia accelerators that predate the latest U.S. rules or procuring chips through grey-market brokers.

With Chinese developers pushing into less mature hardware ecosystems, memory bandwidth is becoming a key constraint. As we reported in September, Chinese memory firms like YMTC and CXMT are exploring HBM production to support domestic accelerators, but no large-scale supply has materialized.

For Nvidia, export restrictions and the growing pivot away from its products in China have eroded its entire share in what was once one of its biggest markets.

Valve doubles down on headset gaming, but it isn't all about VR.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Not quite four years on from the industry-bending success of the Steam Deck, Valve is back with its most ambitious collection of gaming hardware yet. Today, the pioneering PC gaming company is taking the wraps off the Arm-powered wireless Steam Frame gaming headset, a new Steam Controller that takes its design cues from the Steam Deck, and something I never would have guessed, given its past failures: a new compact, cube-shaped Steam Machine gaming desktop, rocking some more semi-custom AMD silicon.

Valve invited us to its headquarters for some early hands-on time with all this new hardware, and I came away mostly impressed. These are big swings for a company that has a tiny number of employees compared to competitors like Epic Games or Microsoft.

But after the huge success of the Steam Deck (and its many pricier copycats), Valve has firmly established itself on the hardware front. Its controller and Linux-powered gaming desktop have a good shot at success if the price is right (Valve isn't talking pricing on any of its new hardware yet).

For those more interested in traditional PC gaming, we're breaking the cube-shaped Steam Machine and new Steam Controller out into its own story [here]. We'll dig into the new headset in detail below, because as much as we love desktops and controllers, the Steam Frame headset is both the most interesting and complex of its new devices, and the one that might be the hardest sell.

 




But the company's secret weapon might be one of its simplest features, which applies to both the Steam Frame headset and the Steam Machine: the ability to pull the microSD card from your Steam Deck and insert it into either of the company's new SteamOS machines and get instant access to your library and saved games. We'll have to see how well that trick works once we get review hardware, but it sounds like a great way to get gamers to further buy into your hardware ecosystem and your game store.

 




The Steam Frame headset, formerly known in leaks as its codename, Deckard, is the real wildcard in Valve's new lineup, as well as the most complex. Aside from, perhaps, Valve's own Half-Life Alyx, compelling, high-production AAA VR games haven't materialized, despite a decade of hardware pushes from Valve, HTC, and most notably Meta.

Valve's solution? The Steam Frame (and its controllers) are designed to play VR titles, as well as traditional PC and mobile games in a resizable in-headset window that actually felt like a big-screen experience during my hands-on time with the headset. Valve engineers told me the company thinks of the Steam Frame less as a VR headset and more as “a new way to play your entire Steam library.” The Frame can do this both by streaming titles wirelessly from your PC, or running them internally on its built-in Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip.

This is all a major change from Valve's previous headset, the Valve Index. That headset, released in 2019, was purely for VR gaming, used base stations for tracking, and required attaching to a computer to play.

With the Steam Frame, streaming from a PC is one option, but the company has a new “Fex” (Valve stylizes it as FEX) software emulation layer that brings SteamOS to the Arm instruction set, which certainly has implications beyond this device. But I'm very curious how much running Windows titles via Proton and Fex is going to affect battery life and performance.

Valve had to design its Steam Frame controllers to handle traditional games alongside those that involve head and controller tracking. In short, in addition to the thumbsticks and triggers, there's a D-pad to the left controller and ABXY buttons on the right, as well as a second set of finger triggers. This is a major difference from Valve's previous VR controllers for its Index headset, which each included an A button, B button, thumb stick, gyroscope, and advanced finger tracking.

In short demos, this seemed to work fine, but I am not sure I'd want to play something like a platformer or other gamepad-focused title for long periods with a separated D-pad and button setup. That said, lots of Switch players have been doing that for years.

Comfort of a headset is going to vary between individuals, and I didn't spend hours using the Steam Frame, so I'm not ready to fully pass judgment yet. But the headset was fairly easy to put on and adjust the IPD (via a knob between the lenses), it never felt heavy in my demos, and I didn't experience nearly as much lens fogging as I have with previous VR headsets. But the latter might have more to do with the climate control in Valve's offices than the headset itself. Like so many other aspects of the Steam Frame, the fit feels good at first blush, but I'd need to spend a lot more time with it on my head to tell just how good it is.

At the very least, the Steam Frame's 440 gram weight (including the battery, padding, and straps) is less than the 515-gram Meta Quest 3.

 




Valve's engineers emphasized that the company sees the Steam Frame as a “wireless streaming-first device.” So while the headset (specifically, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip it runs on, which was a flagship smartphone processor back in 2024) technically supports Wi-Fi 7, for gaming that's streamed from your desktop or laptop, the company includes a dedicated Wi-Fi 6E dongle with the headset. That dongle uses the 6GHz band for game streaming, while the 5GHz band handles Wi-Fi communication duties, like downloads and multiplayer communication, and chat.

 




To improve streaming further, Valve is also offering up some new (but familiar) streaming tech. Foveated rendering — essentially saving compute resources by using eye tracking to render only the center of what you are looking at in the greatest detail — has been a staple of VR for nearly a decade now. But with the Steam Frame, Valve is taking that concept and applying it to game streaming, calling it Foveated Streaming, and pointing out that this isn't something developers need to get involved with.

"The game just renders the full field of view, like it normally would,” said Valve's Jeremy Selan. “The games don't have to do anything to take advantage of the technology."

In my brief time playing Half-Life: Alyx on the Steam Frame at Valve's headquarters, performance was flawless, and the controllers were intuitive. But, of course, we need to spend more time with the headset in settings that aren't Valve's HQ to pass judgment on how well the Steam Frame is at streaming titles from a PC.

But that's not the only way the Steam Frame can game. The company also showed off the x86 version of Hades 2 running standalone (as in not streaming from a PC) on the Steam Frame. And the game ran just fine and looked good at what Valve reps told me was 1400p in a window inside the headset, which I could actually resize to something that filled a large part of my field of view.

“The magic trick is that the game doesn't know it's running on an Arm chip,” designer Lawrence Yang told me. The game may be designed for a Windows PC, but “it's actually running on Linux, running on Arm.”

That happens thanks to Valve's Fex, which is an emulation layer, so that will almost certainly mean increased power consumption / shorter battery life. Valve isn't saying anything about battery life yet (except for the 40-hour per AA controller claim), as they continue to work on the software for now. But like the Steam Deck, this means your gaming time on the Steam Frame is going to vary dramatically, depending on whether you're streaming from a PC or playing something directly on the device.

And the headset definitely felt like it was working harder when running games on the Arm chip rather than streaming. The only time I actively noticed the Steam Frame's fan whirring was when playing the second game that Valve had me test on the headset itself, the VR title Ghost Town. It was very noticeable, but that was likely at least in part because the part of the game I was playing, exploring a small ship at sea, was pretty quiet.

You can see the fan, heatpipe, and other internals in this clear version that Valve had made solely to show off the internal layout. There is definitely a lot of hardware inside a fairly small headset.

 




This level of fan noise wouldn't be problematic for me when playing an action title or something with steady music, but it did slightly spoil the immersion in this one game. Hopefully, that's more the exception than the norm.

Adding your own headphones or earbuds might help with fan noise, but the speakers in the Steam Frame are part of the head strap mechanism. This was good for listening to Valve's engineers while I ran through demos, and sound generally felt fine when gaming, it's not the kind of isolating audio that you might want to be truly immersed in your game world.

Valve's software developer, Jeremy Selan, tried to assuage some of my fears about what Fex might do to battery life, saying the device uses Vulkan, that many games now are natively Vulkan, and that as soon as the game engine makes API calls, they start running in on “natively compiled Arm processing code.”

Similarly, on the CPU side, Selan says it's mostly things like the user interactions themselves (what happens when you pull a trigger or hit a jump button) that go through the Fex layer. He says there is about a 10-20% performance hit with the emulation, but that it only applies to specific aspects of the code.

“When we set out, we didn't know quite how far this would get,” said Selan. “But on games like Hades 2, where we are seeing 1440p at 90 Hz, while running the full VR stack. We're really very happy with it.”

As for which games you'll want to (or have to) run streaming from a PC to the Steam Frame, versus playing locally, Valve says all games (VR and non-VR) can be streamed to the headset from a PC. And similar to the Hades 2 demo, non-VR games will run in a resizable window.For games installed and running on the headset itself, Valve tells me there will be a "Verified" game program similar to what already exists for the Steam Deck, where the company is going to test titles in the Steam catalog and provide guidance. The company's goal is for the Steam Frame experience to be as frictionless as possible, so that people can focus on playing their Steam titles. But obviously there needs to be some distinction between games that you'll need to be near your gaming PC to play, and games you've installed natively and can play while you're at home or traveling with your headset.

Selan also says the Valve team is working on a way to pre-cache the CPU shaders, in a similar way that the company already pre-caches GPU shaders ahead of time on the Steam Deck. This should further reduce the overhead of Valve's Fex emulation layer, but it's not shipping yet.

 




That all sounds good, but Hades 2, which happily runs on the Nintendo Switch, obviously isn't the most demanding title. Again, I'm quite curious to see how the promised “new way to play your entire Steam library” holds up when we get review units – as well as what battery life is like. Obviously, I don't expect the Steam Frame with a smartphone chip to run games like a dedicated gaming rig, but Borderlands 4 is a recent addition to my Steam library, and it can bring my RTX 4090 to its knees.

“From the partner's perspective, we're trying to minimize the effort to get their software on this device,” said Selan, wrapping up my Steam Frame session.”And from a customer's perspective, they shouldn't have to think about anything. They're just going to hit play.

”We'll learn more about how smooth the streaming and native experience is, as well as battery life and how much the Steam Frame costs, as we get closer to launch, which Valve representatives said should be early next year.

Valve rattled the gaming industry in 2022 with the launch of the Steam Deck, letting you take your PC games anywhere with an easy-to-use operating system. Now, the company is taking its learnings from that device and bringing them to your living room in a new gaming PC, the Steam Machine.

Tom's Hardware visited Valve's offices in Bellevue, Washington to talk to the developers behind this new PC and get an early look at the hardware.

This is a system meant for living room play, armed with a new semi-custom AMD Zen 4 CPU and AMD RDNA 3 GPU, and it runs SteamOS just like the Steam Deck. In many ways, it's effectively a Steam-based console. Valve claims that this system is six times more powerful than the Steam Deck, though, so it should be a better couch experience than using the Steam Deck Dock and playing games at low resolution. The company suggests that the Steam Machine can play games in 4K and 60 frames per second, with the caveat that you'll have to rely on AMD's FSR upscaling.

The PC measures 6.39 x 6.14 x 5.98 inches — almost a cube (without the computer's feet, it's 5.83 inches tall). Most of the computer is on the bottom of the box, with the majority of the space inside taken up by a substantial heatsink and fan. The front of the system features a customizable light bar that you can personalize to indicate system status, such as when it is booting up, downloading games, or updating.

"It's mostly a heatsink, because we know that the living room environment is very challenging from a thermal standpoint, from an air flow standpoint," a Valve developer told Tom's Hardware. "So, to sort of make it as quiet as possible and as cool as possible, this is where we need to be."

The heatsink is truly massive. With the top and sides removed, the Steam Machine looks similar to a denser version of Noctua's NH-P1 air cooler, with similar dimensions and denser fins, and a couple of heatpipes poking out of the edges. Hopefully, it proves nearly as quiet as that fanless cooler.

 




The front of the Steam Machine is magnetic, which is designed for easy cleaning. The default is black, but Valve reps said the company will be releasing files for people with 3D printers to come up with their own designs. At their headquarters, Steam had a few custom options it designed, including a very classy woodgrain look and a Team Fortress 2 design.

There was also an e-ink front that displayed system stats in real-time, but it wasn't working when we were in the demo room. Regardless, the company said it doesn't have plans to sell any designs other than the plain front. So if you want something other than basic black, be prepared to make your own.

The Steam Machine's CPU is based on 6 AMD Zen 4 cores, runs up to 4.8 GHz, and has a 30W TDP. The GPU uses AMD's RDNA 3 cores and features 28 compute units, 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM, and a 2.45 GHz max sustained clock.

The processor and GPU are two distinct chips on the same motherboard, which Valve says allows for the best-size device, along with the best thermal performance. Valve did explore a separate add-in board GPU at one point, but we were told that "the compromises that we have to make on size and thermals and cost didn't really pan out."

The CPU is paired with 16GB of DDR5. And while the company is using traditional SODIMMs, it's a bit more complicated to reach them with the heatsink in the way. Technically, you can upgrade it, but with some RF shielding and an attempt to keep the memory as close as possible to the CPU for signal integrity, it might be a bit of work.

There's an integrated 300W power supply. Valve says the GPU uses 110W (though one Valve rep gave a range of 110W - 130W, stating that "we're still kind of fine-tuning that") while the CPU goes up to 30 watts. The CPU peaks at 4.8 GHz.

Valve will sell two configurations of the Steam Machine, and the only difference will be storage. You can get either a 512GB SSD or a 2TB SSD. Either way, Valve is using an M.2 2230 SSD in the system, though there is room to support an M.2 2280 if you decide to upgrade or replace the drive.

There is another way to expand storage. Just like on the Steam Deck, you can use a microSD card. If you remove the microSD card and place it in a Steam Deck or a Stream Frame, your library will come with you, ready to go in other devices.

"For most people, you never have to be seeing [the SSD] at all," said Valve hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat. "[An] SD card is your best way to expand your storage, but if you really want to, you can. It's your device."

In addition, there are distinct Wi-Fi and Bluetooth antennas to help prevent signal issues. If you're using Valve's new Steam Controller, a connection puck is built into the device, allowing for up to four Steam Controllers with no loss in Bluetooth performance. (You are, of course, welcome to connect a mouse and keyboard or use other controllers).

The system supports two displays via HDMI and DisplayPort on the rear. If you add a DisplayPort hub to the rear or use daisy-chaining, the system should be able to support more monitors. While Valve says the HDMI port supports 4K at 60 Hz, it's labeled as HDMI 2.0, not HDMI 2.1, because it doesn't currently use some software features of HDMI 2.1, such as like DSC and ALLM, which Valve says "we are currently working on and hope to rectify in the future."

With the new computer, Valve also has a new controller, the Steam Controller. This will be sold in an optional bundle with the Steam Machine, as well as on its own. Beyond the Steam Machine, the Controller works with anything that runs Steam, including Windows, Mac and Linux PCs, PC gaming handhelds, the Steam Frame, and Steam Deck. If you use Steam Link, iOS and Android devices should work, too.

The controller features two joysticks, ABXY buttons, and a D-Pad in a layout similar to PlayStation's DualSense controller, in that the joysticks are parallel. The extra buttons, including Steam, menu, view, and quick access menu buttons, are also there, along with two trackpads for haptic feedback. The touchpads are on a slight angle up — it's not drastic — and are tilted slightly sideways to address the way your thumbs meet to move them.

"They're clocked and canted, and that is just because based on a ton of experimentation, and probably 30 different orientations of these trackpads, we found that this angle is the most comfortable for the most users when they're playing," Valve's Steve Cardinali said.

The joysticks are using TMR (Tunneling Magnetoresistance) joysticks, which should help reduce stick drift. Valve also said that because these joysticks are so responsive, it could reduce the deadzone on the controllers by more than half.

There are also standard L/R triggers and L/R bumpers, along with four assignable grip buttons, just like on the Steam Deck. Effectively, this whole controller is the Steam Deck controls in a console-style controller.

The other inputs, though, are more unique. There's a 6-axis gyroscope and what Valve calls "Capacitive grip sense," which means the controller can tell that you're holding it. We demoed the Controller in Balatro, lifting fingers off of the controller to activate the gyroscope, making moves, and then placing our fingers back down.

There are four motors in the controller: two in the grips and another two specifically for the trackpads.

You can connect the Steam Controller to devices in three different ways. The primary option is the Steam Controller Puck, which comes pre-paired with the controller. (If you're using a Steam Machine, there's an internal puck inside). The Puck, which plugs into a USB port, uses a proprietary wireless connection that Valve claims is more stable than Bluetooth, and can connect to four controllers. Of course, standard Bluetooth is also an option, as is directly attaching to a computer with a USB cable.

 




The Steam Controller Puck can also charge the controller. There are pogo pins on the puck that you can connect to the Controller in order to charge it when you're not playing games. You can also charge the device over USB.

Valve estimates that you'll get 35 hours or more of playtime on the Steam Controller's rechargeable battery.

Tom's Hardware Managing editor Matt Safford said that the controller felt comfortable in his brief demo time, though he spent more time cycling through the various modes than settling on a specific one. Quickly using the gyroscope to move the cursor after removing a couple of fingers from the grip did instantly feel intuitive. More time, he said, will tell how he feels about the touchpads, given his muscle memory and proclivity for the FPS genre is based on a keyboard and mouse.

The controller didn't feel overly bulky, nor heavy or light. The plastic used in the construction generally felt fine, neither overly cheap or particularly premium. It feels similar to a Steam Deck.

Valve hasn't provided pricing or an exact release date for the Steam Machine or Steam Controller just yet, though we were told to expect the hardware early next year. Some of that uncertainty is because of a volatile market for computer components.

"The market is kind of weird right now," a Valve rep told us. "You know, memory prices are going up like right as we speak. Right now, depending on who you ask, they might tell you the GDDR we're using is not a thing next year, right? So, like, there's a lot of things that we're still trying to figure it out. But, uh, of course, our goal is to be ready, and we think we're doing a pretty good job of that.”

That being said, we were told that the company is aiming for a "great value" on "the entry level side of things." But Valve's developers also mentioned that the Steam Machine, being packed with features, makes pricing a bit of a "balancing act" in an attempt to find a sweet spot. But we won't find out pricing until closer to launch.

The Steam Machine moniker does come with some baggage. That was also the name of a series of small desktop computers released in 2015 running on a previous version of the Linux-based SteamOS. At the time, SteamOS only ran games that worked natively on Linux. And the Steam Machines, which were made by companies like Alienware, Zotac, and Origin, didn't perform as well as Windows-based competitors with similar hardware. At the time, Valve chose not to make its own computer, though it did make a controller.

That controller, also dubbed the Steam Controller, featured a single touchpad in lieu of the right control stick. While some praised it for its flexibility across game genres, the controller eventually went on a firesale in 2019, with Valve selling them at $5 a pop to clear inventory.

Valve's hardware developers told us they've learned from the original Steam Machines, and that they don't want game developers to have to do work to get their games working for the device unless it's additive to take advantage of SteamOS or Steam Machine features.

With newer hardware, better game compatibility, and the Steam Deck as a strong proof of concept, it sure seems from a brief hands-on that the Steam Machine has a better chance this time around.

BluePill, a new Seattle-based marketing startup that helps brands predict consumer behavior, raised $6 million in a seed round led by Ubiquity Ventures.

Founded earlier this year, BluePill helps marketers test ideas, products, and ads in minutes using artificial intelligence instead of traditional focus groups.

BluePill builds a custom AI consumer audience for each brand using real-world data — such as social conversations, surveys, and customer inputs — modeled after a brand's target segment.

Clients log into the platform, upload a new concept, campaign, or packaging design, and receive instant feedback predicting how their audience would respond — essentially running a massive, simulated focus group.

The company is also developing ready-made, domain-specific AI audiences (like “U.S. moms” or “Gen Z snack buyers”) that brands can directly query for insights without building custom models.

BluePill says its simulated audiences achieve 93% accuracy compared to human panels. The company is working with consumer brands including Magic Spoon, Kettle & Fire, and the Seattle Mariners, which use the platform to test fan engagement ideas and in-stadium activations.

“Our edge is validated, accurate insights — and the fact that we deliver these in minutes for a fraction of the cost makes it a no-brainer,”  said BluePill founder and CEO Ankit Dhawan.

BluePill is already generating revenue. It makes money off a fixed annual fee.

BluePill is taking on larger marketing research companies such as Ipsos, Qualtrics, and Nielsen. Dhawan said incumbents “rely on slow, costly human panels, while newer startups mostly have large language models role-play as consumers.”

Dhawan was an entrepreneur-in-residence at the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) and co-founded virtual experience startup Virtuelly. He also spent more than four years at Amazon as a product leader working on AI products.

Other team members at BluePill include Puneet Bajaj and Andy Zhu. BluePill was featured in GeekWire's Startup Radar in June.

Sunil Nagaraj, founding partner at Ubiquity, noted that “predicting consumer behavior is the holy grail of marketing.” Nagaraj is based in Silicon Valley but is active in the Seattle startup scene. He was an early investor in Auth0, the Seattle-area startup acquired by Okta for $6.5 billion.

Pioneer Square Labs and Flying Fish Ventures also invested.



University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

Melinda French Gates today announced the funding recipients of her $250 million open call supporting organizations worldwide that are working to address women's physical and mental health. 

The Action for Women's Health grantees include 83 organizations based in 22 countries. Recipients will receive between $1 million and $5 million, and many have previously been excluded from major funding opportunities. 

“In the 25 years I've worked on women's health, I've been struck by a grim reality that connects women across contexts and continents: No matter where you are in the world, if you live in a woman's body, you are likely to face a unique set of barriers to receiving the care you need to live a full and healthy life,” French Gates wrote in a blog post. 

Those barriers, she continued, include policies such as restrictive abortion laws that caused a woman in Louisiana to twice get turned away from emergency rooms when struggling through a miscarriage, and a lack of proximity to care for a pregnant woman in Malawi who lived hours from delivery services. 

The key focus areas for the Action for Women's Health grantees are: care for pregnant women and mothers and babies; community health and healthcare access; reproductive health and rights; public health; and mental health. Roughly one-third of the organizations receiving funding are focused on maternal and perinatal health, while one-quarter address community health. 

Pacific Northwest-based recipients include Open Arms Perinatal Services, an organization helping mothers with doula services, lactation assistance and other support for families, and Seattle Indian Health Board, a community health center serving Native people.

Action for Women's Health is part of a $1 billion initiative centered on women's and family issues that French Gates announced in May 2024, shortly after her resignation from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. She left the Seattle-based philanthropy, now called the Gates Foundation, with $12.5 billion for her own initiatives as part of her divorce agreement with Bill Gates.

Pivotal Ventures, French Gates' independent company, is overseeing her billion-dollar effort and Lever for Change managed the open call.  

Pivotal previously shared more details on two of its other components: the awarding of $200 million to U.S. groups focused on women's rights, and $20 million grants issued to 12 individuals globally whose work French Gates admires.

Crafting a perfect prompt for AI chatbots is often a challenge —  so much so that startups are creating roles for prompt engineers. Consumer-facing AI apps are increasingly adding features like suggestion buttons or autogenerated recommendations to nudge customers to use the chatbot more frequently and show them about what the app can do.

Hero, a productivity startup founded by former Meta employees, announced a new autocompletion SDK today that will fill in prompts for you based on context. The SDK is currently invite-only and will let developers integrate this tech into their apps.

Here is how it works: When you are booking a flight, you might write “Book a flight” in the prompt. The autocomplete SDK will start populating fields like “to,” “from,””on date,” “at time,” “airline,” and “returning on.” You can stop at any point and send the query to the chatbot.

This is also useful when you are using an AI-powered image or a video generator, where autocomplete can help you with different parameters like object, style, location, landscape, and camera angle. Notably, Adobe's new feature for creating soundtracks with its Firefly app lets user enter keywords in different sections of a prompt, such as mood, style, and purpose, to easily create a tune.

Hero engineer Saharsh Vedi, who worked on this feature, said that usually you usually need a lot of back-and-forth with an AI app to get the results you want. With this autocomplete feature, you can get there with fewer prompts — or even just one.

The startup's co-founder, Brad Kowalk, told TechCrunch that the company is using a series of models to predict what you might type into a prompt next.

“With AI autocomplete, we pull forward all the inputs needed to complete an action, finishing it 10 times faster as there are fewer back-and-forths involved. This unlocks a whole new set of use cases ranging from travel to commerce, and ads to customer support,” Kowalk said.

He added that because there are fewer messages involved, companies operating at scale can save on server costs.

Kowalk said that he and his co-founder, Seung W. Lee, thought of building the tech based on their experience working on AR features at Meta. On AR glasses, there are constraints on screen size, so the interface for prompts needs to be simple — like adding parameters to a query.

The startup, which raised $4 million in seed funding last year, has secured $3 million in additional funding led by Forerunner Ventures. Kowalk said that in the coming months, depending on the app and SDK growth, Hero plans to raise a bigger round.

Hero is testing a version of this technology in its app that helps users find time for a meeting or to catch up with a friend through autocomplete prompts. The feature will be released to users in a couple of months.

The company is also in talks with Koah Labs, an ad tech startup, to build AI-powered ads where brands can show up in autocomplete suggestions.

Blue Origin has again postponed the second launch of its New Glenn megarocket. This time, it wasn't bad weather or a wayward cruise ship that got in the way—it was an ongoing severe geomagnetic storm.

Last night, the arrival of two coronal mass ejections—huge eruptions of plasma and magnetic field from the Sun's surface—triggered dazzling auroras as far south as Alabama. NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) issued a G4—or “severe”—geomagnetic storm watch through Wednesday, as another larger CME is expected to reach Earth around midday.

New Glenn was set to lift off no earlier than 2:50 p.m. ET from Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, according to NASA's Kennedy Space Center. It's worth noting that the Federal Aviation Administration recently issued a ground stop on daytime commercial space launches during the government shutdown, but Blue Origin received an exemption for this launch.

Due to the risks associated with launching during a severe geomagnetic storm, Blue Origin opted to postpone the event until space weather conditions clear up, according to a company statement posted on X just before 10 a.m. ET.  The statement did not specify a new launch date.

NG-2 Update: New Glenn is ready to launch. However, due to highly elevated solar activity and its potential effects on the ESCAPADE spacecraft, NASA is postponing launch until space weather conditions improve. We are currently assessing opportunities to establish our next launch…

— Blue Origin (@blueorigin) November 12, 2025



Geomagnetic storms are major disturbances in Earth's magnetosphere that typically occur when the Sun blasts a CME toward our planet. These disturbances can increase the likelihood of aurora at latitudes farther south. They can also disrupt power systems, radio communications, and spacecraft operations.

According to the SWPC, Wednesday's geomagnetic storm could impact some critical infrastructure, “but mitigation is possible.” Had Blue Origin moved forward with the launch, solar weather could have messed with the communications and navigation systems that New Glenn relies on. Geomagnetic storms also heat the upper atmosphere, which can increase drag and alter ascent conditions.

It's easy to understand why the company chose to postpone. Both Blue Origin and NASA have a lot riding on this launch, so New Glenn won't get off the ground until conditions are just right.

This is only the second test flight for Blue Origin's megarocket. After significant delays, Jeff Bezos' company is under pressure to demonstrate New Glenn's ability to serve as a deep-space launch provider. To that end, the rocket will launch NASA's twin ESCAPADE probes on a journey to Mars during this test flight.

The $80 million NASA mission raises the stakes for New Glenn. ESCAPADE (the Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers mission) will use two identical spacecraft to investigate how solar wind interacts with Mars' magnetic environment and how this drives the planet's atmospheric escape, according to NASA.

It's the agency's first mission to Mars since the Perseverance rover launched in 2020, and it's the first-ever multi-spacecraft orbital science mission to the Red Planet.

Needless to say, Blue Origin needs this next launch to go well. New Glenn's success would make it a strong competitor for both NASA science missions and national security contracts. Here's hoping space weather conditions clear up soon.

iPhone and Apple Watch owners in the United States will now be able to carry a copy of their U.S. passport on their device, which they can then use at TSA checkpoints across more than 250 U.S. airports when traveling domestically. 

The feature, known as Digital ID, was previously announced as part of the iOS 26 release, and adds passports to the list of existing government IDs supported in Apple Wallet. The company has rolled out the feature to a dozen states and Puerto Rico, with more on the way.

Using Digital ID in Apple Wallet, users can create and present an ID, even if they don't have a REAL ID-compliant driver's license or state ID. The ID does not replace a physical passport, and it's not currently supported for international travel or crossing borders, Apple notes.

Users can add their passport to Wallet by tapping on the “Add” (+) button in the Wallet app, then selecting “Driver's License or ID Cards.” From there, select Digital ID and follow the steps to complete the setup process, which includes using the iPhone to scan the photo page of their passport and scanning the chip embedded on the back to ensure the passport's authenticity. Users will also have to take a selfie for verification and then complete a series of facial and head movements for additional security.

Support for IDs in Apple Wallet is the last obstacle standing in the way of making iPhones a replacement for a physical wallet, as it can now hold payment cards, loyalty cards, tickets and passes, and more.

Presenting Apple's new Digital ID in person works much like using Apple Pay. You can double-click the side button or Home button to access your Wallet, then select Digital ID. The iPhone or Apple Watch should be held near an identity reader, and users will use Face ID or Touch ID to authenticate their information. Users will also be able to see what identity information is being requested before completing the verification process.

The feature is still in beta as it hasn't fully rolled out to all the device readers at the TSA checkpoints at this time. (The TSA website offers a list of which states are currently supporting mobile ID, but still advises travelers to carry their physical ID.)

Apple says that users will eventually be able to present their Digital ID at businesses and organizations where they need to verify their age, both in-person and online.

This could include event venues or bars, where users need to present their ID at the door to verify if they're of drinking age. Online, websites that restrict content to adults could also leverage Apple's APIs to verify users' ages. For instance, if a user wanted to order alcohol for delivery through a service like Uber Eats, they could verify their ID during the ordering process.

In both cases, users would be able to confirm that their age is over 21 without having to also share personal information like their name, address or birthday. 

Apple said it can't see when or where a user presents their ID or what data was shared. Plus, users don't have to unlock their phone or hand it over to present their ID, as it works just like Apple Pay.

WisdomAI, the new AI data analytics startup from Rubrik co-founder Soham Mazumdar, has landed a fresh $50 million Series A led by Kleiner Perkins with participation from new investor NVentures (Nvidia's venture capital arm).  

This round comes roughly six months after the startup announced a seed round of $23 million led by Coatue. 

WisdomAI offers AI-driven data analytics that can answer business questions from structured, unstructured, and even “dirty” data, meaning data that hasn't been cleaned of typos or errors. A business user simply asks questions in natural language, such as, “How many customers do I have in my pipeline and what's preventing them from closing this quarter?”  

But the company is using a clever method to eliminate the LLM hallucination problem. WisdomAI is not using LLMs to write answers to questions. Instead, LLMs are only used to write the query —  the part that will go out to a data warehouse to retrieve data. So if the LLM hallucinates, it will simply write an ineffective query rather than inventing false answers.

WisdomAI has written its own logic that it calls the “enterprise context layer,” which studies the customer data to understand it. All of the startup's co-founders worked with Mazumdar at data security company Rubrik, giving them deep experience with enterprise storage warehouses. (Mazumdar left Rubrik in 2023.)

Since formally launching in late 2024, WisdomAI has grown from two enterprise customers to around 40 enterprise customers, CEO Mazumdar says. WisdomAI counts such companies like Descope, ConocoPhillips, Cisco, and Patreon as customers. 

Mazumdar said the young company is also growing usage within its enterprise customers. Some customers have doubled usage within two months. Another customer started with 10 seats and expanded to 450, which is almost everyone in the company, he said.  

In the last six months, WisdomAI has also added an agentic feature that will alert users in real time to important changes in situations they are monitoring. 

“I have created an agent which is watching our product usage metrics, our ticket information,” Mazumdar says, adding that it took him about five minutes to create it. But rather than sending him a daily or, even, hourly report on usage and helpdesk tickets, it alerts him “when something interesting happens,” he describes.

“I think that's the magic with analytics. It's always been a static report, but we are making it dynamic. We are making it proactive,” he said.

Why you can trust Tom's Hardware




Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.


Imagine not needing to replace your entire laptop when you want a new GPU. It's been tried before, but never successfully. But with the release of the second-generation Framework Laptop 16, you have a system with a realistic GPU upgrade path.The new Framework Laptop 16 comes with the option of an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 laptop GPU, which can power your new laptop or replace the GPU in the original Framework Laptop 16 from 2024.

While that makes this the most repairable and upgradeable laptop we've ever seen, it still may not be the best gaming laptop. It's more expensive than most other RTX 5070 machines, and Framework still needs to work on making this system feel as premium as its price.

Framework's latest 16-incher doesn't appear different from the one we tested in early 2024, but there are a few changes. While the laptop still has a silver lid with its logo on the top, the company says it's using a new structure for the CNC aluminum that should make it stronger. There's still some flex, though, particularly in the center (especially when the lid is open).

Our DIY edition laptop still came in a way that feels initially surprising — without a keyboard installed. That's because you have to choose how to align and install it. If you add the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Graphics module like we did, the laptop expands in the back, taking up more room on your desk. But with the touchpad in place and a bezel preinstalled (with a thick bottom edge), this is definitely a large laptop. How you add the keyboard will depend if you also bought a number pad, RGB macropad, or various spacers.

Building the system includes adding the SSD, RAM, and the optional GPU module. Framework has a comprehensive startup guide for the process.For the most part, you can install the keyboard and touchpad anywhere you want. There are a few combinations that won't work, but they don't look like choices I would make. They mostly have to do with having the keyboard or touchpad on the extreme right side.

The keyboard and other accessories go in easily. You place them at an angle and lower them into magnetic connectors. If you want to move them, there are easy pull tabs to get them out of the casing. The keyboard and macros are controlled by a browser-based version the open-source software VIA (found at keyboard.frame.work), which is often used in custom or enthusiast keyboards. Those unfamiliar with VIA will have a bit of a learning curve here.

 




The ports work just like every previous Framework system: with a series of modules that plug into recessed USB Type-C connectors. Like last time around, the company included a headphone jack, which is not included as standard on the device. USB Type-C and Type-A ports are $11 each; a headphone jack is $19. The most expensive options include Ethernet ($39), an SD card slot ($25), and storage modules (250GB for $45, 1TB for $125). Thankfully, the ports seem way easier to remove on this system than they were on previous models. No worries about breaking fingernails here.

Here, too, there are some limitations. Specifically, if you place the USB-A ports in the rear two slots, Framework warns that this could lead to increased power draw. (These slots let the USB-C ports use the USB4 standard, rather than USB 3.2 Gen 2 on the rest of the system.) The rear four slots also support fast 240W charging and DisplayPort output, while the front slots don't.

 




On the back of the Nvidia Geforce RTX 5070 graphics module, there's a USB Type-C port that supports a 240-watt USB Type-C GaN charger. This is the first time we've seen one of these with a system, and it's undeniably cool to not need a barrel connector for this much power. That port also supports video output and USB 2.0 data transfer.

Unfortunately, some of the fit and finish on the Framework Laptop 16 still has room for improvement. I don't have last year's model on me to compare if it's an improvement, but the seams between the spacers and the touchpad and keyboard make the Laptop 16 feel far less of a premium product than it is.

Framework's standout achievement is still the fact that you can replace effectively every part of its laptops. Getting into the Framework Laptop 16 takes a bit of elbow grease, but if you have any experience inside a computer, it shouldn't be too difficult (especially with a litany of step-by-step guides to help).

Getting inside requires removing all of the input modules and then pulling a cable in the metal plate labeled as an obvious step "1." You can use the T5 screwdriver included in the box to loosen the 16 captive Torx screws (also labeled as 2-17) in order. With the mid-plate off, you'll be able to see room for two SSDs: a primary M.2 2280 SSD and a secondary, shorter M.2 2230 slot. You can also add your own RAM, swap out the battery, or even the motherboard (though the AMD Ryzen AI 300 series boards are the latest available).

The other upgrade option is the graphics. If you buy it with this GeForce RTX 5070, you'll have the top-of-the-line option. But if you have an existing AMD Radeon RX 7700S module (or the new one with upgraded cooling) or opt to use the integrated graphics, you always have the option to add the RTX 5070 later.

 




This is perhaps Framework's standout accomplishment to date. Changing out motherboards in a laptop for multiple generations is impressive, no doubt, but successfully shipping a second-generation GPU (from another vendor than the previous one, to boot!), that users from new and existing Laptop 16s can upgrade to, is a promise fulfilled. It's also one that Alienware famously didn't fulfill with its Area-51m. While it shipped units within generations, when it became time to move to the next generation, you had to buy a whole new gaming laptop, which led to a class action lawsuit against Alienware's parent company, Dell.

In short: wow, they did it. I wish Framework had a larger range of GPUs for its customers to choose from, but the technological achievement is impressive.

The GPU upgrade is a bit more involved than other changes you can make to the Laptop 16, involving sensitive electronics like interposers.

After removing the keyboard and touchpad, there's a door to open to access the electrical interposer. (You don't need to remove the midplate, though. Count your blessings.) There are four captive screws to loosen (or three if you have the empty expansion bay shell installed), and then you can pull it out with a tab.

From there, two more captive screws hold either module in place. Then, you close the interposer door and flip the system over so you can slide the GPU module or expansion shell out.

 




If you're already getting the GPU, I'd suggest leaving it in there full time, unless the weight and slight thickness difference is going to make a massive difference to you.

The components in the new Framework Laptop 16, including the AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 CPU and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 laptop GPU provide a significant boost over the previous generation. If you upgrade your mainboard and GPU, you'll see some pretty big gains in games. The GPU doesn't support some of the Max-Q technologies found on Nvidia-based gaming laptops, like Dynamic Boost and WhisperMode, though.

We compared the system to the 2024 Framework Laptop 16 with Radeon RX 7700S to see the difference you get when you upgrade the CPU and GPU. We also compared an RTX 5070 gaming laptop, the MSI Katana 17 HX.

When I played Alan Wake 2, I set the screen to 1920 x 1200 and the render resolution to 1114 x 696 (balanced). I used DLSS (the game requires upscaling), but not frame gen, and opted for the high settings and ray tracing presets. The game ran between 70 and 82 frames per second as I navigated the New York City subway as Wake.

On the Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark (highest settings), the Framework with RTX 5070 ran the game at 132 FPS at 1080p, beating the MSI's 119 FPS. At native 2560 x 1600, it ran at 76 FPS.

At 1080p, the RTX 5070 was able to run Cyberpunk 2077  at its ray tracing ultra preset at 38 FPS, just one frame behind the Katana.

The Framework outperformed on Borderlands 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2, but the Katana won out on the CPU-focused Far Cry 6.

To stress test the system, we ran the Metro Exodus at RTX settings in a loop 15 times to simulate half an hour of gameplay. The Laptop 16 averaged 91.95 FPS.

During that test, the Zen 5 CPU cores ran at 4.19 GHz, while the Zen 5c cores reached 2.68 GHz. The GPU averaged 1,550 MHz.

The mainboard in the 2025 Framework Laptop 16 features an AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 CPU. Our unit came paired with 16GB of RAM, as well as a 1TB WD Black SN770.

We compared the system to the previous Framework Laptop 16 (AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) and a 17-inch gaming notebook, the MSI Katana 17 HX (Intel Core i7 14650HX, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD).

The first time we ran our benchmarks, the system rebooted during the tests. Framework replaced the unit with a second one and new, otherwise identical components.

On Geekbench 6, the Framework Laptop 16 won out over both its last-generation counterpart, and the Katana in single-core performance with a score of 2,878. In multi-core, the Framework saw gen-over-gen improvements with a score of 12,399, but the Katana HX scored higher. That processor may have older cores, but it has 16 cores while the Ryzen AI 7 350 has 8 cores.

The speed of your SSD is going to depend heavily on what you choose to put in this laptop. The 1TB WD Black SN770 in our review unit isn't a default pairing with the Laptop 16 (its successor, the SN7100, is), but the part is available on Framework's store as an option. The Framework Laptop 16 copied 25GB of files at a rate of 1,724.69 MBps.

It took the new Framework Laptop 16 a total of four minutes and 18 seconds to transcode a 4K video to 1080p. That beat both the Katana (4:30) and the previous-gen Framework (4:34).

While the Framework Laptop 16's screen is still 16-inches with a 2560 x 1600 resolution with a 165 Hz refresh rate, it has some new tricks up its sleeve. Specifically, if you have an Nvidia GPU, the screen now supports G-Sync to prevent screen tearing.

 




But in our instrumented measuring, we also found improvements in color gamut volume. Framework said that it's an identical screen, but that "NVIDIA graphics drivers may have different color optimization behaviors." It covered 113.1% of the DCI-P3 space by volume and 159.6% sRGB. Those are big jumps over the previous Laptop 16 screen (75.4% DCI-P3 / 106.5% sRGB). Both Frameworks were brighter than our comparison gaming laptop (though that MSI Katana is far cheaper).

When I used the system to play Alan Wake 2, the green and murky browns of a haunted New York subway system created a haunting aura. I appreciated the matte display, which let me play near a window, though that did seem to knock down a bit of the perceived colors.

The new screen measured 444 nits of brightness — 40 nits dimmer than the previous model, which isn't huge but isn't nothing, either.

Your keyboard and touchpad modules on the Framework Laptop 16 will depend on your preferences and what you buy. For example, we tested the standard US English keyboard, which doesn't feature a Windows Copilot key as it's set for both Windows and Linux. This computer does meet Microsoft's Copilot+ criteria, however, and there's another keyboard with the Copilot key if that's your thing.

 




There are also a number of languages available, as well as blacked-out keys and RGB options, for additional costs.

I tended to use the keyboard left-aligned, as I was often trying the RGB macropad or numberpad alongside it. That being said, you may prefer something centered. The touchpad, too, can be aligned in multiple ways.

 




I found that the keys, which Framework says offer 1.5 mm of travel, are overly mushy for my taste. That didn't stop me from bouncing along at 122 words per minute with a 1% error rate on the monkeytype test. For comfort, though, I'm not sure how much Framework can do. It's pretty limited by the fact that the keys have to fit in between the lid and the midplate.

The touchpad works fine (I didn't have any of the issues I had on the original Framework Laptop 16), with multitouch gestures and simple navigation all operating as expected, though clicks are a bit loud. I still, however, can't stand the seams between the spacers and the touchpad module, which both look and feel cheap on this premium-priced laptop. I suppose I'm the target audience for the 3D printer files Framework released for those who want a full-width palmrest.

I'm still waiting for Framework to release a module with a haptic trackpad.

Framework's stereo speakers on the Laptop 16 do the job, though they're average at best.

When I listened to Kaleo's "Way Down We Go," I appreciated the stereo speakers' balanced mix of drums, synths, guitars, and vocals. The drums, in particular, were impressively snappy. That being said, the bass was negligible when I noticed it at all, and while this computer got loud enough for my needs, there are others that can really fill a room.

In Alan Wake 2, the speakers did enough to keep me in the action, as it pumped out the sounds of bullets, and scared me as a surprise villain taunted the protagonist from behind when I wasn't paying enough attention.

Adding a discrete GPU often comes with battery life costs. On our test, which involves streaming video, light OpenGL tests, and web browsing at 150 nits of brightness, the Laptop 16 with RTX 5070 ran for 8 hours and 20 minutes. That's a dip from the original Framework Laptop 16 with AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS and Radeon RX 7700S, which went ran for 8:49.

 




The MSI Katana 17 HX, a dedicated gaming laptop, ran for 6:21.

One way to get more juice out of this system would be to remove the RTX 5070 and use it with just the CPU and integrated graphics, though that would reduce its usefulness in certain workflows.

We measured skin temperatures on the Framework Laptop 16 while running our Metro Exodus stress test, pushing the RTX 5070. The laptop was a bit hotter on the keyboard than I'd like to see, but it's still fine to use.

During the test, the keyboard measured 100.9 degrees Fahrenheit, the touchpad hit 91.5 F, and the hottest spot on the bottom, unsurprisingly on the GPU, measured 110.6 F.

The CPU averaged 62.13 degrees Celsius, and the GPU measured 637.34 MHz.

Framework is touting a second-generation webcam with an upgraded image sensor. The 1080p webcam, which records at 30 frames per second, is fine but not mind-blowing, particularly at this price.

While I found it to look good enough for most use cases, I did note some graininess, especially in the background. Colors appeared slightly cool, though the camera did have to contend with a window right next to my desk.

One of the best parts of using Windows 11 on a Framework Laptop is that the company doesn't fill the OS with extra bloatware. We installed Windows ourselves, and the only extra we got was a link to the Framework Marketplace in the Start Menu. It wasn't even pinned.

Of course, if you buy the DIY edition, you don't need to start with Windows 11. Framework also supports a ton of Linux distributions, if that's your thing.

Framework sells the Laptop 16 with a one-year warranty in the United States and Canada.

Framework sells the Laptop 16 in three different prebuilt configurations that are ready to use with Windows 11, or a DIY model in which you bring your own RAM, storage, and operating system (though Framework will happily sell those to you, if you would like).

The prebuilt options start at $1,499 with an AMD Ryzen AI 7 350, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. An extra $200 bumps you up to 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, while the top-end $2,549 option has a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, 64GB of RAM, and 2TB of storage. That's all without a discrete GPU; if you want to add the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070, you have to add $650 more. On the bright side, these systems include a power adapter.

You'll also have to buy expansion cards for ports. Framework recommends six (one for each port), which is a minimum of $66, assuming you get all USB Type-C and Type-A ports, but prices vary depending on the port.

The DIY Edition, which we tested, is a bit more free-flowing. You start with either a $1,499 model with the Ryzen AI 7 350 or a $1,799 option with a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. From there, you can add the RTX 5070 ($650) or Radeon RX 7700S ($350) if you want discrete graphics. Framework sells memory and storage separately, and also doesn't include a power adapter on DIY models — you have to shell out $109 for the 240W GaN adapter, or bring your own. Framework recommends a minimum of 100W without the graphics module or 180W with it, though it says 240W will "provide the best experience."

Our review laptop, with the Ryzen AI 7 350, 16GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, an RTX 5070, and a number pad is $2,396, though it would be more if we counted the RGB macropad ($79). That doesn't include the money necessary for the expansion cards, which will differ heavily depending on which ones you want.

Black bezels and a basic keyboard come included, though if you want special colors, layouts, or RGB, those cost extra. You also have to pay for spacers or input modules to finish out the laptop. At a minimum, two spacers are a total of $20. The numberpad is $39, while the RGB macropad is $79.

Framework did it. It made a laptop that supports multiple generations of GPUs. You can remove the module, replace it, and upgrade from a Radeon RX 7700S to an RTX 5070. It's a remarkable technical achievement, though I wish there were more GPU options.

And beyond that, the Framework Laptop 16 remains the most customizable laptop I've ever seen, though that does mean some unsightly seams and gaps that cheapen the experience.

The matte display is vivid and is great at avoiding reflections, and it's cool to see one of the first systems to come with a 240W GaN USB-C charger, assuming you pay for it.

But this system is more expensive than other RTX 5070 gaming laptops, so if you're just using it for gaming, you may want to consider other options. The MSI Katana we compared it to was $1,300 when we tested it.

But if you prioritize repairability above all else, and want the ability to change out GPUs, there's no other way to go. The Framework Laptop 16 is still one of a kind. You just have to be willing to deal with the hitches (and the high price) that can come with that.

When Google's self-driving car project began testing in the Bay Area back in 2009, its engineers focused on highways by sending its sensor-laden vehicles cruising down Interstate 280, which runs the length of Silicon Valley's peninsula.

More than 15 years later, the cars are back on the freeway—this time without drivers. On Tuesday, the project, now an Alphabet subsidiary we all know as Waymo, announced that its robotaxi service would now drive on freeways in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and Phoenix.

The new service marks another technical leap for Waymo, whose robotaxis currently serve five US metros: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area. The company says it will launch in several other US and international cities next year, including Dallas, Miami, Nashville, Las Vegas, Detroit, and London.

Waymo also announced Wednesday that it would begin curbside pickup and drop-off service at San Jose Mineta International Airport, allowing passengers to, theoretically, travel autonomously all the way from San Francisco to San Jose—a service area of some 260 square miles. Waymo has been offering its autonomous taxi service on area service roads since the summer of 2023, but the new freeway service could cut in half the time it takes for a robotaxi to travel from San Francisco to Mountain View, Waymo user experience researcher Naomi Guthrie says.

“Freeway driving is one of those things that's very easy to learn, but very hard to master,” Waymo co-CEO Dmitri Dolgov told reporters last week. Highways are predictable, with (mostly) clear signs and lane lines, and a limited set of vehicles and players (trucks, cars, motorcycles, trailers) that a vehicle's software must learn to recognize and predict. But Waymo executives said that, despite a year of employee- and guest-only highway testing, safety emergencies on highways are relatively rare, so the team was unable to collect as much real-world data as it needed to train its vehicles to operate safely there. Complicating the project was the fact that highway crashes, at high speeds, are subject to the laws of phsyics—and so more likely to maim or kill.

To get ready for highways, Waymo executives say, engineers supplemented real-world driving data and training with data collected on private, closed courses, and data created in simulations. Two onboard computers help create system “redundancies,” meaning the vehicles will have computer backup if something goes wrong. The vehicles have been trained to exit highways in the case of emergencies, but will be able to pull over as well. Waymo execs also say they have and will work with law enforcement and first responders, including highway patrols, to create procedures for vehicles and riders stranded on highway shoulders, where hundreds of Americans are killed every year.

The new service area, in blue, in the San Francisco Bay Area.

At launch, Waymo freeway trips will only occur on limited portions of certain highways: US Route 60, Interstates 10 and 17, and Loop 202 in Phoenix; US Route 101, Interstates 80, 280, and 380, and State Routes 85, 92, and 237 in the Bay Area; and Interstates 5, 10, 105, 110, and 405, and State Routes 2, 60, 90, and 187 in LA County. For now, freeway trips will only be accessible to Waymo riders who opt in to freeway driving within the app; gradually, they will be rolled out to all riders, the company says.

On a recent trip out to Washington D.C., I visited Whole Foods' Daily Shop store that just opened in Arlington, Va.

It's a new concept — a smaller, urban-focused version of the traditional Whole Foods grocery store. The first three Daily Shop locations opened in New York City over the past year, and Whole Foods announced Wednesday that it will open two more stores in Brooklyn and New Jersey in December. 

The store in Arlington sits at the base of a Booz Allen Hamilton office building in the Crystal City neighborhood, nearby Amazon HQ2. It replaced a former Amazon Fresh store — a reminder of Amazon's ongoing experimentation in the $890 billion grocery industry.

 “Pick up your grab-and-go meals, snacks, and weekly essentials,” noted a sign at the front door.

Outside, several black vertical metal-frame signs reading “Produce” and “Deli” are mounted on white subway-style brick tiles, giving the storefront an upscale, modern feel.

Inside, it feels much like a regular Whole Foods — green-painted walls and a produce section just past the entrance.

The Daily Shop occupies more than 10,000 square feet — roughly a quarter to half the size of an average 40,000-square-foot Whole Foods Market, according to the company. It still manages to fit the essentials — produce, prepared foods, packaged meat and fish, alcohol, toiletries — without feeling cramped.

It's also the first Daily Shop to offer Amazon pickup and returns. 

When I visited around 3 p.m., one staffed checkout and six self-checkout stations reinforced the store's grab-and-go focus. 

It's hard to place Daily Shop into a grocery category. It is larger than a 7-Eleven but smaller than a Safeway — closer to a mini grocery store. In some ways, it felt like a Trader Joe's, which have an average footprint of around 15,000 square feet.

In a press release announcing the Arlington Daily Shop, Jose Gomez, the store team leader, said: “If you want a quick lunch, need some ingredients on your way home from work or you're stopping in for a meal to-go ahead of a flight, we're ready to serve you!”

In fact, I was actually heading to my flight at the nearby Reagan airport — in the target market for the new store.

The Daily Shop in Arlington is just a short walk away from a full-sized Whole Foods adjacent to Amazon's HQ2 campus. So I walked less than a mile to compare the experience.

Prices were identical at the traditional store, compared to Daily Shop ($6.99 for a pound of chicken breasts, $5.29 for a dozen extra large brown eggs, $4.29 for a slice of pizza). Given its larger size, it also had much more to offer — a robust hot food bar (Daily Shop only had pizza slices and chicken), a coffee shop, a fresh meat/seafood case, etc. There were also advertisements for holiday catering and an area for grocery delivery orders.

Whether grabbing a quick lunch, a to-go meal before a flight, or a couple of ingredients for dinner — I prefer the larger Whole Foods location. The expansive hot bar and wider selection of items make it a better option for me. There's also a Costco a few blocks away.

Some of the initial Google reviews for the Daily Shop store reflect this sentiment. 

Other customers praised the store for friendly staff and cleanliness. 

Whole Foods reported Wednesday that 42% of shoppers at the Daily Shop location in New York City's Lenox Hill neighborhood were either new or re-engaged Whole Foods customers — “proving the concept is successful at driving new business to the retailer.”

I could see the stores attracting more traffic in a “food desert” where there aren't many other grocery options, including a traditional Whole Foods location. It seems to primarily serve urban professionals, commuters, or nearby office workers.

“At our new store formats, we're tailoring every square foot to the unique, fast-paced needs of urban lifestyles, ” Whole Foods exec Christina Minardi said in a press release last year.

The grocer said Wednesday that berries, grapes, and avocados are among the top-selling items across Daily Shop locations, along with ready-to-eat foods and rotisserie chickens.

Daily Shop may appeal more so as a place to return Amazon orders. Several customers mentioned their desire for a package return service in reviews of the Daily Shop in New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood.

The stores could also serve as a testbed for new Amazon grocery technologies — as the company did with its “Just Walk Out” checkout-free system, which debuted in Amazon Go stores before expanding (and later being removed) from Amazon Fresh locations.

Other retailers are finding recent success with small-format stores, which need to be more selective about which products are stocked but can offer a faster shopping experience and appeal to urban customers that just need a few items, Business Insider reported.

Whole Foods has tried small-format concepts before, including its now-discontinued “365 by Whole Foods Market” stores.

On a recent earnings call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said he was “very excited” about Daily Shop and said the initial three stores in New York City were off to a “very good start.”

Amazon has had mixed results in grocery overall, dating back to the initial launch of Amazon Fresh in 2007 to the $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017 and beyond. It has introduced new store formats, paused and restarted expansion, and shifted away from its “Just Walk Out” technology.

Last week, Amazon revealed another grocery experiment: a “store within a store” model that uses automated micro-fulfillment to bring name-brand items into Whole Foods locations.

It's part of a recent effort to weave Whole Foods into its broader grocery business. 

The company's grocery arm is led by Jason Buechel, the CEO of Whole Foods who expanded his role earlier this year to also oversee Amazon's Worldwide Grocery Stores business. Whole Foods workers will become Amazon employees in December.

Amazon said it had more than $100 billion in gross sales of groceries and household essentials in 2024, excluding sales from Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh. The company is also pushing tighter integration of fresh grocery delivery with other Amazon.com products.

Airbnb is piloting a service with Instacart that will allow guests to order groceries directly through the Airbnb app before and during their stay, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Wednesday.

“We are regularly testing new product updates, categories and initiatives, in order to provide the best possible experience for our community,” an Airbnb spokesperson said in an email. “As part of that, following the launch of Airbnb Services earlier this year, we will pilot groceries with Instacart in select markets across the U.S. beginning in January.”

The new kitchen stocking service will be available to select hosts with qualifying listings in Phoenix, Orlando, and Los Angeles, according to a help page on Airbnb's website.

The news was first reported by Bloomberg.

If hosts receive their guests' preorders and put them away before they check in, they will receive $25, according to the the help page. They will also receive a $100 bonus for their first completed order. Guests will be able to place orders on Instacart from the Airbnb app up to three weeks before their stay.

“By bringing groceries powered by Instacart directly into the Airbnb app, we're making it easier for guests to stock their kitchens and feel at home from day one,” an Instacart spokesperson said in an email. “We're excited to partner with Airbnb on this pilot and put our broad retailer network and leading technology to work for their guests.”

The new partnership with Instacart marks the latest addition to Airbnb's “Services,” which launched in May and allow guests to book services and experiences, like getting a massage, haircut, or chef-prepared meal. While these offerings can be added to your stay, they can also be booked independently. 

The launch of Services put Airbnb more directly in competition with other travel companies such as Tripadvisor, Booking.com, Viator, and GetYourGuide. 

Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky has said Services will help the company add $1 billion or more in revenue a year.

Stefan Kalb, a Seattle entrepreneur who previously founded grocery tech startup Shelf Engine, is back with a new venture — and a mission to bring artificial intelligence to mid-market companies that don't have technical expertise.

Kalb is co-founder and CEO of Super Labs, which launched in September and just raised $8 million in a seed funding round led by Seattle-area venture firm FUSE. Other backers include Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, Liquid 2 Ventures, Soma Capital, and others. 

Kalb said the idea for Super Labs emerged after he kept getting calls from people who run “non-tech businesses” and wanted to figure out how to implement AI. 

“If you're non-technical, and you're trying to move into the AI space — it's really hard,” Kalb said.

Super Labs operates as both a marketplace and an implementation partner. The platform allows business owners to describe their problems — “I need to stop manually tracking project hours across three spreadsheets,” for example — then visualizes their workflows and identifies where AI can be integrated.

The company doesn't typically build the AI solutions itself. Instead, it connects businesses with existing AI vendors — such as a voice AI tool — and handles the complex integration work that would normally require technical expertise.

Kalb sees massive opportunity in the mid-market segment, which he said is larger than the S&P 500 in economic terms. His concern is that without platforms like Super Labs, these companies will fall behind as enterprise customers gain access to AI tools.

“The mid-market companies are going to get screwed,” he said.

On the supply side, Super Labs provides a marketplace for developers to distribute their AI products through usage-based models, offering exposure to non-tech customers they otherwise couldn't reach.

For now, Super Labs is focused on proving its model with early customers in manufacturing, e-commerce, distribution, and retail — businesses that have “all these different workflows that can be automated,” Kalb noted.

Super Labs enters a crowded field of AI consultants and implementation firms. It competes against agent directory platforms such as Gumloop and Langflow, and enterprise software marketplaces such as Vendr and Tropic. Kalb said his company differentiates with its marketplace approach and focus on security and reliability.

Kalb co-founded Super Labs with Jared Kofron, who was a principal software engineer at Pioneer Square Labs and previously worked at Flux, Rover, and Glowforge.

Kalb's first entrepreneurial experience was founding Molly's, a healthy food company that supplied salads and sandwiches to Seattle-area cafes and hospitals. That brick-and-mortar experience exposed him to the operational challenges of traditional businesses. “I would have dreamed of having Super Labs,” he said. 

Shelf Engine, his next venture, applied AI to reduce food waste in grocery stores by predicting optimal ordering quantities for perishable goods. The company worked with major retailers like Kroger, Target, and Dollar General before its acquisition by retail data company Crisp earlier this year.

Shelf Engine raised more than $60 million from investors and landed celebrity endorsements — but later went through layoffs. Kalb called it a “disappointing acquisition.”

Kalb said he plans to be more deliberate about scaling Super Labs than he was with Shelf Engine, where rapid hiring led to challenges.

Other backers in Super Labs include Massive Tech Ventures (Kalb's own venture fund), Mercury CEO Immad Akhund, Pioneer Fund, and longtime tech leader Gokul Rajarm. 



University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

World Labs, the startup founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, is launching its first commercial world model product. Marble is now available via freemium and paid tiers that let users turn text prompts, photos, videos, 3D layouts, or panoramas into editable, downloadable 3D environments.

The launch of the generative world model, first released in limited beta preview two months ago, comes a little over a year after World Labs came out of stealth with $230 million in funding, and puts the startup ahead of competitors building world models. World models are AI systems that generate an internal representation of an environment, and can be used to predict future outcomes and plan actions.

Startups like Decart and Odyssey have released free demos, and Google's Genie is still in limited research preview. Marble differs from these — and even World Labs' own real-time model, RTFM — because it creates persistent, downloadable 3D environments rather than generating worlds on-the-fly as you explore. This, the company says, results in less morphing or inconsistency, and lets users export worlds as Gaussian splats, meshes, or videos.

Marble is also the first model of its kind to offer AI-native editing tools and a hybrid 3D editor that lets users block out spatial structures before AI fills in the visual details.  

“This is a brand new category of model that's generating 3D worlds, and this is something that's going to get better over time. It's something we've already improved quite a lot,” Justin Johnson, co-founder of World Labs, told TechCrunch. 

Last December, World Labs showed how its early models could generate interactive 3D scenes based on a single image. While impressive, the somewhat cartoonish scenes weren't fully explorable since movements were limited to a small area, and there were occasional rendering errors. 

In my trial of the beta preview, I found Marble generated impressive worlds from image prompts alone — from game-like environments to photorealistic versions of my living room. Scenes morphed at the edges, though that's apparently been improved in today's launch. That said, a world I'd generated in the beta using a single prompt looked better and matched my intent more closely than the same prompt does now. 

I haven't yet tested the editing features, though Johnson says they make Marble practical for near-term gaming, VFX, and virtual reality (VR) projects. 

“One of our main themes for Marble going forward is creative control,” Johnson said. “There should always be a quick pathway to generate something, but you should be able to dive even deeper and get a lot of control over the things that you're generating. You don't want the machine to just take the wheel and pull all that creativity away from you.” 

Marble's take on creative control starts with input flexibility. The beta only accepted single images, forcing the model to invent unseen details for a 360-degree view. With the full launch, users can now upload multiple images or short clips to show a space from different angles and have the model generate fairly realistic digital twins. 

Then we have Chisel, an experimental 3D editor that lets users block out coarse spatial layouts (think walls, boxes, or planes) and then add text prompts to guide the visual style. Marble generates the world, decoupling structure from style — similar to how HTML provides the structure of a website and CSS adds in color. Unlike text-based editing, Chisel lets you directly manipulate objects.  

“I can just go in there and grab the 3D block that represents the couch and move it somewhere else,” Johnson said. 

Another new feature that gives you more editing control is the ability to expand a world.  

“Once you generate a world, you can expand it up to once,” Johnson said. “When you move to a piece of the world that's starting to break apart, you can basically tell the model to expand there or generate more world in the vicinity of where you currently are, and then it can add more detail in that region.”

Users who want to create extremely large spaces can combine multiple worlds with “composer mode.” Johnson demonstrated this for me with two worlds he had already built — a room made of cheese with grape chairs, and another of a futuristic meeting room in space.

Marble is available via four subscription tiers: Free (four generations from text, image, or panorama), Standard ($20/month, 12 generations plus multi-image/video input and advanced editing), Pro ($35/month, 25 generations with scene expansion and commercial rights), and Max ($95/month, all features and 75 generations). 

Johnson thinks the initial use cases for Marble will be gaming, visual effects for film, and virtual reality.  

Game developers have mixed feelings about the tech. A recent Game Developers Conference survey found a third of respondents believed generative AI has a negative impact on the games industry — 12% more than the survey indicated year earlier. Intellectual property theft, energy consumption, and a decrease in quality from AI-generated content were among the top concerns aired. And last year, a Wired investigation found game studios like Activision Blizzard are using AI to cut corners and combat attrition. 

In gaming, Johnson sees developers using Marble to generate background environments and ambient spaces and then importing those assets into game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine to add interactive elements, logic, and code. 

“It's not designed to replace the entire existing pipeline for gaming, but to just give you assets that you can drop into that pipeline,” he said.  

For VFX work, Marble sidesteps the inconsistency and poor camera control that plague AI video generators, per Johnson. Its 3D assets let artists stage scenes and control camera movements with frame-perfect precision, he said. 

While Johnson said World Labs isn't focusing on virtual reality (VR) applications right now, he noted the industry is “starved for content” and excited about the launch. Marble is already compatible with the Vision Pro and Quest 3 VR headsets, and every generated world can be viewed in VR today.

Marble may also have potential use cases for robotics. Johnson noted that unlike image and video generation, robotics doesn't have the benefit of a large repository of training data. But with generators like Marble, it becomes easier to simulate training environments.  

According to a recent manifesto by Fei-Fei Li, CEO and co-founder of World Labs, Marble represents the first step toward creating “a truly spatially intelligent world model.” 

Li believes “the next generation of world models will enable machines to achieve spatial intelligence on an entirely new level.” If large language models can teach machines to read and write, Li hopes systems like Marble can teach them to see and build. She says the ability to understand how things exist and interact in three-dimensional spaces can eventually help machines make breakthroughs beyond gaming and robotics, and even into science and medicine. 

“Our dreams of truly intelligent machines will not be complete without spatial intelligence,” Li wrote.

Power demands of data centers have grown from tens to 200 kilowatts in just a few years, a pace that has data center developers scrambling to design future facilities that can handle the load. 

“In the next couple of years, it's going to be 600 kilowatts, and then we're going to a megawatt,” Tim Heidel, CEO of Veir, told TechCrunch. “We're speaking to folks that are now trying to wrap their heads around the architecture for how you design data centers that have multi-megawatt racks.”

At those scales, even the low-voltage cables that bring power to the racks start to take up too much space and generate too much heat.

To rein that in, Veir has adapted its superconducting electrical cables to bring them inside the data center. The Microsoft-backed startup's first product will be a cable system capable of carrying 3 megawatts of low-voltage electricity.

To demonstrate the technology, Veir built a simulated data center near its headquarters in Massachusetts. The cables will be piloted in data centers next year in advance of an expected 2027 commercial launch, Heidel said.

Superconductors are a class of materials that can conduct electricity with zero loss of energy. The only hitch is that they need to be cooled well below freezing temperatures.

Veir had previously focused on using superconductors to improve capacity on long-distance transmission lines. But utilities are cautious and tend to be slow to adopt new technology. While there's still a good chance utilities will eventually tap superconductors for high-demand transmission lines, that transition is a bit further in the future.

“The pace at which the data center community is moving, evolving, growing, scaling, and tackling challenges is far higher than the transmission community,” Heidel said.

Veir has been in talks with data centers for years. Recently, the tenor of those conversations changed.

“We were seeing a lot of folks saying, ‘Oh this grid interconnection problem is a real thing, and we got to figure out how to solve that.' But then a handful of potential customers started turning around and saying, we actually have really hard problems to solve on our campuses and inside of our buildings,” he said.

The startup took the same core technology that it had developed for transmission lines and adapted it to the low-voltage needs of data centers. Veir buys the superconductors from the same suppliers, and they're wrapped in a jacket to contain the liquid nitrogen coolant that keeps the material at -196˚ C (-321˚ F). Termination boxes sit at the end of those cables to transition from superconductors to copper cables.

“We're really a systems integrator that builds the cooling systems, manufactures the cables, puts the whole system together in order to deliver an enormous amount of power in a small space,” Heidel said.

The result are cables that require 20 times less space than copper while carrying power five times farther, Veir said.

“The AI and data center community is desperate to find solutions today and is desperate to stay ahead. There's a tremendous amount of competitive pressure to stay at the forefront,” Heidel said.

Japanese tech company Kyocera has developed underwater optical communications (UWOC) technology that enables short-distance, high-speed wireless communication. According to its press release, this allows data transmission speeds of up to 5.2 Gbps in freshwater laboratory settings, which is much faster than the few Mbps that typical underwater acoustic communications systems achieve.

The company achieved this by developing a laser specifically tailored for underwater communications using its own protocols and physical layers. Aside from that, it has an optical front-end circuit — the hardware that converts light into electrical signals — that can hit bandwidths greater than 1 GHz, making it around 2.5x faster than its competition.

This development is crucial for advancing underwater drone technologies, as it enables them to stream data to users on the surface or aboard a mothership, including high-resolution photos, a live video feed, and sensor data. This makes them useful for underwater inspections and can even be used to simultaneously communicate with multiple sensors for comprehensive data collection.

This still would not replace underwater fiber-optic cables for long-distance communication, though, as UWOC are typically limited to around 100 meters. Since the laser travels through water, this can greatly impact its range. And because it requires line-of-sight, you cannot use UWOC to control a drone for exploration, and even passing marine life can disrupt the connection.

However, it's great for specific applications, especially with its high speed, massive bandwidth, and low latency. It's also harder to intercept versus acoustic signals, which propagate in the water in all directions, and are heavily affected by environmental noise like ship engines and the sound emitted by large undersea mammals.

Aside from controlling underwater drones, this technology could also be used for communicating with permanently installed sensors. These can be used for monitoring undersea infrastructure, including fiber optic cables and pipelines, as well as for automatically tracking tagged marine wildlife when they come within range of a UWOC sensor. It may even serve in military applications, where it can be used to communicate with underwater drones launched from submarines or larger boats.

The U.S. says it's a seizure — China says it was stolen.

The China National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC), Beijing's primary cybersecurity agency, has accused Washington of stealing 127,272 Bitcoin — worth more than $13 billion USD at today's exchange rate — in a December 2020 hack. According to Nikkei Asia, the CVERC outlined the details of the cyberattack on its WeChat account, saying that the stolen amount from five years ago came from LuBian, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency miners, and matches the amount the U.S. DOJ says it seized from Zhi.

Chen Zhi and his company, Prince Group, were accused of running scam call centers across Cambodia. Aside from the cases that he's facing in the U.S., other countries and territories, like Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, have acted against the company, freezing more than $500 million in assets across borders and leading to the arrest of at least 25 people.

Although the hack happened in 2020, the stolen crypto remained dormant for over four years. Then, in 2024, the U.S. allegedly moved the funds after Zhi's indictment. There is currently no clear link between Zhi and LuBian, although Washington contends that Chen Zhi owned the wallet that contained the Bitcoin. On the other hand, Beijing's report says, “This is clearly not the behavior of a typical hacker eager to cash out for profits, and more like a precise operation orchestrated by a national hacking organization.”

This seizure is the largest of its kind in history, even eclipsing the $6.7 billion amount the U.K. confiscated from the “Bitcoin Queen”, who used the cryptocurrency to launder proceeds from over a hundred thousand victims in China. LuBian has no public ownership records, even though it was once one of the largest Bitcoin miners on Earth, reportedly controlling around 6% of the global hashrate, as reported by Blockscope Research. The operation seemingly disappeared overnight in 2021, though, and many analysts now link this to the 2020 hack.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have recently agreed to a truce to the trade war between the two powers that has been intensifying over the past months. Because of this, it's unclear why China released the statement, especially given that it's not directly involved in the cases. Although LuBian reportedly used to have a presence in Iran and China, Beijing has put a blanket ban on crypto trading and mining within the country in 2021. Aside from that, even though Zhi was born Chinese, he's now based in Cambodia and reportedly has citizenship in the country (although his exact whereabouts are unknown), and his company is registered in Phnom Penh.

This issue reveals the complication of digital assets, especially in the world of international crime and cross-border investigations. After all, if the seized amount were fiat currency, the U.S. would have to coordinate with the authorities of the host country where the seized amount is stored to recover it. But with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the individual wallets holding them do not fall under a specific jurisdiction, and the authority over them would vary depending on who has access to them.

ElevenLabs, the AI company slowly making itself synonymous with AI dubbing and narration, announced two deals with movie stars on Tuesday that are sure to irk AI opponents in wildly different ways. Aging Texan chill bro Matthew McConaughey is further intertwining his finances, and some of his minor creative output, with the AI company. Meanwhile, 92-year old Cockney legend Michael Caine is being inducted into ElevenLabs' rather chillingly named “Iconic Marketplace.”

McConaughey will be “investing an undisclosed sum” in the company, and adding its product to one of his steady creative workflows. “Since our first conversation, I've been impressed by how the ElevenLabs team has taken the magic of the core technology and turned it into products that creators, enterprises, and storytellers use daily,” McConaughey wrote in a Silicon Valley lingo-tinged statement about the deal.

Gizmodo asked ElevenLabs for McConaughey's ownership percentage, and will update if we hear back.

What McConaughey is literally doing is, well, having someone add ElevenLabs' tech to his newsletter-podcast-YouTube thingy called “Lyrics Of Livin' with McConaughey.”

Please do listen to it. It's very McConaughey.

It's a weekly newsletter of thoughts and stories from McConaughey-land that he also narrates. Judging from the audio quality and mic work, it sounds like McConaughey (quite charmingly) records the English-language audio track himself on home equipment before an animation pass is added and the product is uploaded to YouTube and emailed out.

What's coming, it seems, will ostensibly be a Spanish-language version of Lyrics Of Livin' with a robotic approximation of McConaughey's own vocal timbre and inflection. According to the newsletter's website, the new version will be called—you guessed it—”Lyrics Of Livin' con McConaughey.”

“Now, thanks to ElevenLabs, Lyrics of Livin' is expanding with a Spanish language edition, allowing us to reach and connect with even more people,” McConaughey said in his statement.

The other news item the company McConaughey owns some unspecified amount of announced on Tuesday at the same time is that Michael Caine is now a member, and seemingly the standard bearer, of the Iconic Marketplace. ElevenLabs describes what it's offering in the following terms:

“License AI voices and IP of history's most iconic figures for your creative projects. Request licensing for entertainment legends, sports heroes, musical pioneers, and transformative historical figures. Our marketplace connects creators with rights holders for the most iconic IP.”

The overwhelming majority of the voices on offer here, including Maya Angelou, John Wayne, Judy Garland, and Richard Feynman, are “speaking” from beyond the grave. In fact, it seems out of the 26 icons in the Iconic Marketplace, the only living ones other than Caine are Art Garfunkel and Liza Minnelli. What a trio.

But there's simply no refuting ElevenLabs' choice of word: Michael Caine's voice is iconic. And you can now license a digitized version of it for your “projects and content” through ElevenLabs for the low low price of, well, the price isn't provided until you tell ElevenLabs what the project is. But one can only assume it's much less than the cost of having the actual man vibrate his tremulous vocal cords for you.

A friend of mine got evicted illegally from the homeless shelter and got a moderately sized settlement which was a challenge for him to receive because he made it to his 50s without ever getting a bank account.He started getting scam texts from someone who kept needing money to get a bus ticket to visit him and one time claimed to be at the local airport needing money for a cab ride.  One of our friends convinced him to take a cab to the airport himself to meet this "person" who wasn't there.We were thinking that they might have targeted him based on public records but I can say in the last few months I've met five people who are think are scammers sending me DMs on the like of Mastodon, Bluesky and Tumblr.

I guess this is a first step toward some larger legal goal? It's not even clear if “Lighthouse” is the name of an overseas company or just the name of the service.

Figuring out what streaming ratings mean will probably always be a bit of a mystery. Unlike the days of broadcast TV, there's no centralized way of tracking and comparing what's grabbing the most eyeballs in any given week. However, when a streamer as big as Netflix trumpets a smash hit, you can figure that title is a bona fide success. Think Squid Game or KPop Demon Hunters—or Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein.

The Oscar-winning director's adaptation of Mary Shelley's gothic classic hit Netflix on Friday, November 7, after a brief theatrical run—and it seems many people waited to watch it at home or watched it again if they ventured out to see it. According to the streamer, Frankenstein was the top English-language movie in 72 countries in data drawn from November 3-9. So only a couple of days of that included Frankenstein, but that was still enough for the movie to pull in over 29 million views, for nearly 74 million hours watched of Oscar Isaac's mad-sciencing and Jacob Elordi's monster-emoting.

“Seeing people embracing Frankenstein in the way I have for over 50 years now is really meaningful,” del Toro said in a statement provided to Deadline. “I've seen an outpouring of love, with many sharing with me about their repeat viewing, both in the 600 sold-out screenings and now globally on Netflix. This is a film I've carried with me my entire life, and to see it resonate so deeply with audiences around the world is a really full circle moment.”

Whether Frankenstein can keep its spot on top remains to be seen, but it'll have a tough time catching up to KPop Demon Hunters‘ massive view count. Earlier this year the animated musical became Netflix's most-watched film release and still racked up over 12 million views this past week, which happens to be its 21st week in the streamer's top 10.

Chinese cybercriminals are scamming the world. Over the last few years, these fraudsters have sent millions of scam text messages—often impersonating the USPS or toll-road collection firms—and allegedly made more than a billion dollars from their brazen schemes. The groups of SMS scammers are a prolific—and annoying—menace to millions of people.

Now, in one of the most high-profile actions against the scammers so far, Google is suing alleged members of one “relentless” Chinese smishing group that it claims has tried to con people in more than 120 countries around the world. In a civil lawsuit filed today in the US Southern District of New York, Google alleges that 25 unnamed individuals have operated as part of the “Lighthouse” scam network and targeted millions of Americans with texts in a “staggering” operation.

As well as “stealing” information and money from people globally, the Lighthouse Enterprise, which is sometimes known as part of the “Smishing Triad,” also “preys on the public trust in Google” by using its logos on fraudulent websites and abusing its systems and technology, the company's lawsuit claims. “With the rise in scams, it's largely due to the action of organized crime networks, and most of them are transnational,” Halimah DeLaine Prado, general counsel at Google, alleges in an interview with WIRED. “The Lighthouse network has an enormous reach.”

The Lighthouse group is one of several Chinese-speaking smishing groups that have emerged in recent years. Broadly, the groups blast out scam messages to thousands of people using SMS, Google's RCS service, or Apple's iMessage. Each scam text impersonates an organization—such as delivery firms, banks, or law enforcement services—and includes a link to a fraudulent website. If someone enters their details into these false websites, the scammers can collect their personal information and bank details in real time. Some of the groups are also known to create false online shopping websites that can also steal data.

Central to the Lighthouse operation is its scamming software, called Lighthouse. This software is developed by cybercriminals and then sold as a subscription service to less technically capable fraudsters who use it to send the scam text messages. Scammers can purchase “weekly, monthly, seasonal, annual, or permanent” subscriptions to use the software, Google's lawsuit claims.

“The Lighthouse platform is a phishing-as-a-service tool used by cybercriminals to steal bank and card information, offering ready-made phishing templates, fake websites, and backend management tools, enabling collection of usernames, passwords, and one-time codes, and it supports large-scale message delivery via iMessage and Google Messages' RCS (Rich Communication Services) channels rather than just SMS,” says Halit Alptekin, chief intelligence officer at security firm Prodaft, which has tracked the Chinese-speaking phishing ecosystem. “It employs advanced anti-evasion techniques such as IP- and user-agent-based filtering, time-limited URLs, and domain rotation to hamper detection,” Alptekin says.

The Lighthouse platform has been widely used, according to research from cybersecurity firm Silent Push. Across a 20-day period, Silent Push analysis alleged that activity linked to Lighthouse had targeted people in at least 121 countries and that 200,000 scam websites can be linked back to the network. It's likely that the number of scam messages cybercriminals are sending each day is “significantly higher” than 100,000, the research says. Citing research by the CSIS Security Group, Google's legal filings claim that the Lighthouse network may have stolen between “12.7 million and 115 million” US credit or banking card details.

Google's lawsuit against two dozen individuals it says it has linked to the Lighthouse operation alleges how the broader network is made up of several types of cybercriminals: data brokers, who provide lists of people to target with scams; spammers, who provide the tech needed to send messages en masse; a theft group of individuals using stolen account details to access victims' bank accounts; and administrators who organize the groups. The lawsuit claims the 25 individuals it is targeting have all “participated in the management or operation” of the Lighthouse scheme.

Lighthouse “offers” more than 600 phishing templates that scammers can use to try to steal people's personal information, Google's legal filing says. These impersonate more than 400 entities or organizations, the firm says in its lawsuit. “Lighthouse users can filter and search for templates by geographic region, country, official website, and update time,” its court document claims. Around 200 of these templates spoof organizations in the United States, such as the US Postal Service, New York City's government website, New York's E-ZPass website, multiple state-level departments of transportation websites, and more. In total, 116 phishing templates use Google's branding or that of its Gmail, YouTube, or Google Play products, the lawsuit says.

Google's DeLaine Prado tells WIRED that the company has spent significant time and resources trying to crack down on the scammers' behavior. The lawsuit—while against individuals Google believes are in China and likely out of reach of proceedings—aims to give it and other companies the ability to dismantle the Lighthouse operation more broadly. The company argues that those involved have violated multiple legal statutes and is asking the court to issue a temporary restraining order and permanent injunctions against the individuals.

“Filing a case in the US actually allows us to have a deterrent impact outside of the US borders,” DeLaine Prado says. Rulings in the company's favor would also allow it to “go to other platforms that are hosting vectors or aspects” of the Lighthouse network and ask them to take them down, she says. “It enables others to do the same as well. That court order can be used for good to help dismantle the actual infrastructure of the operation,” she adds. The company also says it is now supporting multiple bipartisan bills in the US Congress, including those against scams, robocalls, and scam compounds.

While Google's lawsuit doesn't name specific individuals who may be behind the Lighthouse network, and those who are outside of the US may not respond to the claims, it does list the Telegram handles of accounts allegedly promoting the software and multiple Telegram groups that the lawsuit claims they run.

Telegram did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment.

Although the legal action could potentially help to dismantle what are alleged to be some of Chinese smishing groups' operations, it is possible that the groups will adapt. In recent years, the Lighthouse software has been updated multiple times, with new capabilities being added to it and frequent additions of new phishing templates, experts say.

“The wider Chinese-speaking smishing actors and fraud ecosystem are continually evolving and growing, and they have been incredibly innovative at every step,” says Ford Merrill, a security researcher who tracks the operations at SecAlliance, which is part of the CSIS Security Group. Merrill points out that in recent years, the groups have developed their tools to be able to add stolen card details to digital wallets on iPhones and Android phones, and also use a wide range of ways to send scam messages, from phone farms to SMS blasters. In recent years, there has been a surge in SMS blaster use, with criminals operating devices that can be carried around in backpacks.

“They have incredibly capable real-time modular phishing tools that allow so many possibilities for defrauding their victims,” Merrill says. “This has and continues to be a serious global problem that we continue to monitor actively as it evolves.”

Update: 11/12/2025, 10:43 am EDT: WIRED clarified how criminals are using SMS blasters, in relation to a quote from Ford Merrill.

As we mark Cybersecurity Awareness Month, it's important to recognize the opportunities and safeguards that come with emerging technologies. In the field of corrections, AI is beginning to help facilities work smarter, not harder, by supporting staff who manage complex workloads, staffing shortages, and budget constraints. In day-to-day facility operations, that means streamlining case routing, reducing paperwork bottlenecks, and giving officers back valuable time for investigations and direct engagement.

When thoughtfully designed, AI can reduce the strain on limited resources, streamline administrative processes, and help identify risks earlier. The result is a more efficient, responsive system where officers can focus on what matters most: safety, rehabilitation, and human connection.

Every meaningful technology advancement starts with listening. For correctional facilities, that means understanding the realities of those who keep operations running, from correctional officers and case managers to IT teams and administrators. Each faces distinct challenges: managing staff shortages, heavy caseloads, and time-consuming reporting requirements. When we listen to these perspectives, patterns emerge. For example, staff often cite time and paperwork as their biggest barriers, not willingness to innovate.

By engaging with officers and administrators early and often, technology partners can design tools that fit within existing workflows rather than disrupt them. Officers might identify that incident reports take hours to compile, or administrators might flag data silos that slow investigations. With that input, AI solutions can be tailored to reduce those pain points to automating reports, flagging relevant cases faster, and consolidating data for easier review. When officers see that their feedback directly shapes the tools they use, adoption and trust grow naturally.

Listening also extends beyond product design to implementation and training. Every facility has its own culture, infrastructure, and pace of change. By involving staff in testing and iteration, organizations ensure AI complements human judgment, supports compliance, and respects privacy. The goal isn't to introduce technology for technology's sake, but to co-create solutions that remove friction, enhance safety, and give officers back valuable time.

AI can streamline routine tasks and summarize data, duties that once required hours of manual review. Investigative workflows benefit from automated alerts, consolidated reporting, and smarter case management tools. Facilities using AI in this way often see:

These efficiencies give officers back valuable time to focus on investigations, mentorship, and direct engagement that fosters safer environments.

AI is powerful behind the scenes, but it cannot provide situational instinct. Only trained officers can read intent, de-escalate conflict, and respond to physical or mental health challenges in the moment. Officers bring the discernment and fairness that algorithms cannot replicate.

That's why integrating AI effectively also means investing in adaptive training and real-time support so officers remain in control of complex decisions. Correctional officers should always be valued for their unique perspective, the experience they hold across various facilities and environments, and their sharp mindset when making important in-the-moment decisions.

Pairing AI with human oversight is crucial. When correctional officers use AI to streamline tasks or flag risks, they remain the decision-makers. This balance ensures that technology supports, not substitutes, professional judgment.

Transparency is also key. AI systems must be explainable, auditable and designed to prevent bias. When officers can validate or dismiss recommendations quickly, trust grows, and facilities can refine technology in feedback. Success should be measured in case resolution speed, backlog reduction, time saved and accuracy in AI-driven alerts.

By embedding accountability into every step, correctional facilities can build trust not only among staff, but also with incarcerated individuals and the communities they return to. This integrated model, where officers, technology, and people work together, creates safer facilities and improved outcomes. It frees officers to focus core duties and keeping facilities safe while AI manages background tasks, supporting stability, and making better use of limited resources.

At Securus Technologies, we believe technology works best when guided by people. By listening to the needs of correctional officers and facility leaders, we design AI tools that reduce repetitive burdens and free up staff time for higher-impact work.

Our commitment is to responsible innovation: AI that supports safety, strengthens operations, and helps create opportunities for rehabilitation.

At its best, AI is not about surveillance or replacement; it's about enabling the power of technology to further advance and optimize solution driven product and services. It's empowering professionals, improving outcomes, and making better use of limited resources. Together, we can build a correctional system that is not only more effective but also more fair, stable, and compassionate.

Eighty years they drained the coastal lowland swamps making central Israel broadly livable - prior it was a morass eg Roman generals writing about the difficulty of transporting soldiers through the region, not catching malaria, etc.Then they figured out it was causing all kinds of environmental problems, so they had to reintroduce swamp like terrain in some cases.Everything is trade offs I guess.

IIRC reswamping is mostly done for rewilding terrain. A lot of migratory birds passing through area.The only hard problem caused by "terraforming", it's that because of water from Sea of Galilee not allowed fully to flow to Dead Sea, it's level gone down and it created a lot of sink holes.To mitigate it, there is another long discussed pumping projects that can't lift off:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea%E2%80%93Dead_Sea_Water...

Statements that they'll help thwart “mercenary spyware” are putting Apple and Meta on the side of platform users with fears about spying tools.

The Guardian reports that two spyware firms with ties to Israel are seeking to “make inroads with the Trump administration.” Those companies include the NSO Group—the notorious seller of the powerful Pegasus mobile spyware—and a firm called Paragon, which has previously contracted with the government.

Due to its many, many controversies over the years, NSO has had its fair share of financial problems, but the Israeli firm was recently bought by a U.S.-based group of investors. David Friedman, who previously served as Trump's ambassador to Israel during his first administration, has been named NSO's new head executive.

Recently, Friedman told the Wall Street Journal that he wanted to cozy up to the White House and sell NSO's services to American law enforcement agencies. “If the administration, as I expect they'll be, is receptive to considering any opportunity that might keep Americans safer, it will consider us,” Friedman told the newspaper.

Paragon, meanwhile, is another Israeli spyware firm that was also recently purchased by an American company. Last December, Paragon, maker of a piece of spyware called Graphite, was acquired by a U.S. investment firm called Red Lattice, Reuters previously reported. The Guardian notes that Paragon has worked in the past with the U.S. government, having “entered an agreement with ICE in 2024, under the Biden administration.” The outlet writes: 

Several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the relatively small contract had slipped under the White House's radar until it was reported by Wired. The contract was then paused in order to determine whether the contract met the requirements of an ambitious executive order that had been signed by the White House in May 2023 and prohibited the operational use of spyware that poses “risks to national security or has been misused by foreign actors to enable human rights abuses around the world.”

NSO has been accused of letting its products hack into some of the most prominent web messengers and platforms—including Meta's WhatsApp and Apple's iMessage. Paragon has also been accused of allowing its tool Graphite to target WhatsApp users. Now, The Guardian reports that both of those companies are pledging that they will protect mobile users from any future spyware.

A spokesperson from Apple told The Guardian: “Threat notifications are designed to inform and assist users who may have been individually targeted by mercenary spyware and geographic location is not a factor in who they are sent to.” Apple did not respond to Gizmodo's request for comment.

When reached for comment by Gizmodo, a Meta spokesperson said: “WhatsApp's priority is to protect our users by disrupting hacking efforts by mercenary spyware, building new layers of protection and alerting people whose device has come under threat, no matter where they are in the world.”

Gizmodo reached out to NSO for comment. It was unclear how to reach Paragon Solutions, as its website didn't appear to have a contact portal. NSO has previously claimed that its products do not target U.S. citizens.

Authorities in the U.S. have had their eyes on these spyware firms for some time—albeit for different, often contradictory, reasons. On the one hand, in 2021, the Biden administration acknowledged that companies like NSO were having a detrimental impact and blacklisted it from U.S. investment. On the other hand, the FBI also spent years mulling whether to use the spyware for domestic law enforcement investigations. Now, the two powerful cyberweapons distributors seem to be attempting to cozy up to the Trump administration.

Published today in Mayo Clinic Proceedings, a University of Minnesota Medical School research team found that access to wheelchairs through Medicare-listed suppliers is inconsistent and often challenging.

Using a secret-shopper approach where researchers posed as patients seeking care, the research team evaluated insurance acceptance, administrative requirements, delivery timelines and costs in two urban zip codes. Only one-half of suppliers with wheelchairs in supply accepted Medicare, and many imposed additional documentation requirements. Among these suppliers, nearly half reported it would take several weeks before wheelchair approval and delivery. 

For those paying cash, the median wheelchair cost was $300. Most suppliers accepting Medicare did not mention Medicare's rent-to-own program for wheelchairs.

Patients attempting to access a wheelchair through suppliers listed in the Medicare directory face administrative and logistical challenges, highlighting the need for urgent policy form to assist vulnerable older adults in accessing critical medical equipment. Greater oversight of supplier practices, clearer standards and improved directory accuracy are needed to reduce administrative and financial barriers for beneficiaries."

Arjun Gupta, MBBS, assistant professor, University of Minnesota Medical School

Further studies are suggested to expand to rural and diverse geographic settings, evaluate the accuracy of Medicare's supplier directory and assess the real-world impact of access barriers on patients and caregivers.

"Patients with mobility issues are often forced to navigate a maze of phone calls, insurance rejections and paperwork just to get a basic wheelchair. These delays and barriers leave many with no choice but to pay out-of-pocket through online marketplaces or other sources- this is an unacceptable burden on those already facing health problems," said Dr. Gupta, who is also an oncologist with M Health Fairview.

This research was funded by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.

Molecular and genetic testing has become a game-changer in brain tumor care - shaping diagnosis, guiding treatments and opening doors to new therapies. Once available to a handful of patients, these tests are now rapidly being adopted across the NHS, according to a new study led by Professor Kathreena Kurian at the University of Bristol and the Tessa Jowell Brain Cancer Mission. The findings, published in Neuro-Oncology Practice today [13 November], mark long-awaited progress in a field that has seen few new treatments in over two decades.

But the study also exposes deep regional inequalities. Access across the UK still depends on postcode, with some hospitals hampered by transport and processing delays, and others lacking the means to freeze tumor samples after surgery - a basic requirement for advanced testing.

Study lead, Professor Kurian from the University of Bristol and North Bristol NHS Trust, the issue is both scientific and personal. She said: "My husband, Gerard, was able to access cutting-edge treatment through a trial at the Royal Marsden. This was only possible because his tumor was frozen and underwent whole genome sequencing. The genetic data revealed a match with a new trial, and Gerard was able to have precious extra time with us as a result.

"Unfortunately, not all patients are given that same opportunity – often unaware that something as simple as how tissue is stored can determine what treatments or trials, they might later access. It is my mission to change this."

The study was conducted in collaboration with the Tessa Jowell Brain Cancer Mission, a national convening body of cancer charities, the Department of Health and Social Care and 47 NHS hospitals, committed to promoting equitable access to brain tumor care.

Using data collected as part of the Tessa Jowell Centre of Excellence from NHS centres covering 84% of the UK population, the research team found that although genomic testing has expanded rapidly – with a 291% increase in whole genome sequencing (WGS) since 2021 – many services are struggling to keep pace.

Two key findings include:

As well as the need for equitable investment and adoption of new innovations highlighted by the study, Professor Kurian sets out three practical steps that can be taken to achieve equity of access: 

We have seen extraordinary progress in brain tumor genomics over the past few years, thanks to the hard work of staff in our hospitals and the NHS's commitment to commissioning these advanced tests for brain tumor patients. But it is vital that this transformation benefits not just some but all patients, irrespective of where they are diagnosed.

The Tessa Jowell Brain Cancer Mission will continue to work with our charity members, the NHS, researchers and policymakers to close the gap between innovation and access, ensuring that every brain tumor patient has the opportunity to benefit from cutting-edge diagnostics and treatments."

Dr. Nicky Huskens, CEO, Tessa Jowell Brain Cancer Mission

The study was possible thanks to the dedicated efforts of the 21 NHS teams who provided data, the Centre of Excellence committee and through the funding and support of the Tessa Jowell Brain Cancer Mission's partners.

Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) has demonstrated a new application for its cell-expansion bioreactor to advance tissue engineering and cell-based therapies for treatment of injuries and diseases.

SwRI scientists used the bioreactor to replicate induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) derived from adult skin, blood, and other somatic cells. Their pluripotent state allows iPSCs to differentiate into any other cell type in the body, much like embryonic stem cells but without the same ethical ambiguity. Large quantities of iPSCs are needed for regenerative medicine and individualized healthcare, but current technology requires manual production.

Using the SwRI-developed single-use 3D-printed bioreactor, we successfully harvested significant quantities of iPSCs. We are working on further differentiating those iPSCs into neural progenitor cells, which could support the regeneration of neurons that are damaged due to injury. International studies have shown that neural progenitor cells can repair the spinal cord when administered in the first 28 days following a spinal cord injury."

Dr. Nick Mc Mahon,  Senior Research Scientist, leader on the project

SwRI's 3D printed bioreactor matrix boasts a larger surface-to-volume ratio compared to traditional 2D cell culture devices such as flasks or dishes, and it can grow more cells using an automated perfusion method. Due to the exceptional geometry of SwRI's bioreactor, cells maintain a monolayer without forming clusters during the cultivation process, minimizing the risk of spontaneous differentiation into the wrong type of cells.

"Since the discovery of iPSCs in the early 2000s, scientists have been exploring their potential to revolutionize medicine by using a patient's own cells to repair or replace damaged tissues to avoid immune rejection. Unlike embryonic stem cells, iPSCs pose no ethical controversy, making them a promising and responsible path toward personalized medicine," said Institute Engineer Dr. Jian Ling.

SwRI plans to further refine the prototype to advance automation and provide a simplified plug-and-play cell replication platform to accelerate the development of iPSC-based therapies.

This project received funding through SwRI's Internal Research and Development Program. In 2024, SwRI invested more than $11 million in tomorrow's technology to broaden its knowledge base, expand its reputation as a leader in science and technology and encourage its staff's professional development.

Autophagy, the process by which cells remove damaged organelles and pathogens, plays a vital role in maintaining cellular health. Yet its role during viral infection has remained elusive. Autophagy is crucial for immunity and the removal of viruses from the cell's cytoplasm, a process known as virophagy.1 When a viral infection occurs, the innate immune system can trigger autophagy to break down the invading viruses.

Herpesviruses have evolved strategies to sometimes evade autophagic degradation, such as by producing particular proteins that inhibit autophagy.

Two human herpesviruses that can lead to cancer are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), both of which are part of the gamma-herpesvirus sub-family.

Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is linked to several conditions, including Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), B-cell primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD), and osteosarcoma. KSHV is present globally but is less widespread than other herpesviruses, with a unique regional distribution. Worldwide, KSHV seroprevalence is generally below 10 %, though it is higher among men who have sex with men. In sub-Saharan Africa and Mediterranean regions, seroprevalence can vary from 20 % to 80 % across both genders. The virus is primarily transmitted through saliva.2

Currently, the autophagy process during KSHV entry into host cells remains unclear. Additionally, there is no curative treatment or vaccine for KSHV infection, highlighting the importance of understanding early immune responses to KSHV entry. This understanding could potentially lead to new targets for antiviral therapies.

Researchers at the University of Zurich3 visualized the rapid activation of autophagy within minutes of KSHV entering host cells. The autophagy marker, cytosolic microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), was shown to co-localize with viral capsid proteins, signaling that the cell's defense machinery was engaging incoming viruses.

Through correlative confocal microscopy using the Thermo Scientific Helios 5 Hydra UX DualBeam (focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope - FIB-SEM) and reconstructed in Thermo Scientific Amira Software, scientists produced high-resolution 3D models revealing that KSHV particles reside within amphisomes, fusion vesicles formed between autophagosomes and endosomes. These structures indicate that cells actively target virus-damaged compartments for degradation.

The study identified galectin-8 and the receptor NDP52 as critical mediators of the autophagic response to KSHV. When the virus disrupts endosomal membranes, galectin-8 detects the damage and recruits NDP52, which in turn mobilizes autophagy machinery to degrade the infected vesicles.

Through quantitative co-localization analysis, the researchers were able to visualize and analyze molecular interactions, confirming that the galectin-8-NDP52 partnership is central to early antiviral defense.

 The integrative imaging workflow, linking confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, and image segmentation in Amira Software, was key to visualizing the sequence of molecular events that drive viral restriction. Amira Software enabled the team to:

These capabilities confirmed that selective autophagy serves as a rapid, effective antiviral defense, intercepting KSHV before infection is established.

The discovery that selective autophagy restricts KSHV infection through the recruitment of galectin-8 and NDP52 marks a significant step forward in understanding how cells defend themselves against viral invasion. With Amira Software, scientists can explore these complex biological processes in remarkable 3D detail, transforming visualization into a powerful tool for discovery.

A research team in South Korea has successfully developed a novel technology that combines nanoparticles with stem cells to significantly improve 3D bone tissue regeneration. This advancement marks a major step forward in the treatment of bone fractures and injuries, as well as in next-generation regenerative medicine.

Dr. Ki Young Kim and her team at the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT), in collaboration with Professor Laura Ha at Sunmoon University, have engineered a nanoparticle-stem cell hybrid, termed a nanobiohybrid by integrating mesoporous silica nanoparticles (mSiO₂ NPs) with human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSCs). The resulting hybrid cells demonstrated markedly enhanced osteogenic (bone-forming) capability.

Three-dimensional stem cell aggregates such as spheroids and organoids have long been used to mimic organ and tissue structures. However, they have suffered from core cell death and non-uniform differentiation due to poor oxygen and nutrient diffusion, limiting their practical use in bone regeneration and drug evaluation.

To overcome these challenges, the research team evenly attached nanoparticles to the stem cell surfaces, allowing the cells to interweave and form stable spherical clusters. The nanoparticles function both as structural scaffolds and osteogenic stimulators, slowly releasing bone-promoting biomolecules that guide the stem cells to differentiate uniformly into bone tissue.

Experimental results revealed that the nanobiohybrid spheroids exhibited higher cell viability and uniform osteogenic differentiation compared to conventional spheroids. In a mouse calvarial (skull) defect model, the implanted nanobiohybrid spheroids regenerated 36% of the defected bone area within six weeks, achieving approximately 1.3 fold greater bone regeneration than spheroids made of stem cells alone.

Although the study is currently at the preclinical animal stage, the researchers expect that this platform could be further developed into patient-specific bone grafts after validation in large animal models and clinical studies.

This approach can be extended beyond bone to regenerate various tissues such as cartilage and skin."

KRICT President Dr. Young-Kuk Lee added, "We hope that our stem-cell-based regenerative technology will help improve treatments for bone fracture patients in an aging society."

This research was published in the journal ACS Biomaterials Science & Engineering (Impact Factor: 5.5) in August 2025, with Dr. Ki Young Kim as the corresponding author and Professor Laura Ha as the first author.

Conventional wearable ultrasound sensors have been limited by low power output and poor structural stability, making them unsuitable for high-resolution imaging or therapeutic applications. A KAIST research team has now overcome these challenges by developing a flexible ultrasound sensor with statically adjustable curvature. This breakthrough opens new possibilities for wearable medical devices that can capture precise, body-conforming images and perform noninvasive treatments using ultrasound energy.

KAIST (President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced on November 12 that a research team led by Professor Hyunjoo Jenny Lee from the School of Electrical Engineering developed a "flex-to-rigid (FTR)" capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) capable of transitioning freely between flexibility and rigidity using a semiconductor wafer process (MEMS).

The team incorporated a low-melting-point alloy (LMPA) inside the device. When an electric current is applied, the metal melts, allowing the structure to deform freely; upon cooling, it solidifies again, fixing the sensor into the desired curved shape.

Conventional polymer-membrane-based CMUTs have suffered from a low elastic modulus, resulting in insufficient acoustic power and blurred focal points during vibration. They have also lacked curvature control, limiting precise focusing on target regions.

Professor Lee's team designed an FTR structure that combines a rigid silicon substrate with a flexible elastomer bridge, achieving both high output performance and mechanical flexibility. The embedded LMPA enables dynamic adjustment and fixation of the transducer's shape by toggling between solid and liquid states through electrical control.

As a result, the new sensor can automatically focus ultrasound on a specific region according to its curvature - without requiring separate beamforming electronics - and maintains stable electrical and acoustic performance even after repeated bending.

The device's acoustic output reaches the level of low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU), which can gently stimulate tissues to induce therapeutic effects without causing damage. Experiments on animal models demonstrated that noninvasive spleen stimulation reduced inflammation and improved mobility in arthritis models.

In the future, the team plans to extend this technology to a two-dimensional (2D) array structure - arranging multiple sensors in a grid - to enable simultaneous high-resolution ultrasound imaging and therapeutic applications, paving the way for a new generation of smart medical systems.

Because the technology is compatible with semiconductor fabrication processes, it can be mass-produced and adapted for wearable and home-use ultrasound systems.

This study was conducted by Sang-Mok Lee, Xiaojia Liang (co-first authors), and their collaborators under the supervision of Professor Hyunjoo Jenny Lee. The results were published online on October 23 in npj Flexible Electronics (Impact Factor: 15.5).

The research was supported by the Bio & Medical Technology Development Program (Brain Science Convergence Research Program) of the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) and the Korea Medical Device Development Fund, a multi-ministerial R&D initiative.

A first-of-its-kind UK study reveals that while teachers feel more confident tackling vaping in the classroom, widespread confusion about how harmful vaping really is shows schools still need clearer, evidence-based messages for students.

Study: Teachers' experiences of delivering youth vaping prevention materials in schools in England and Scotland: A cross-sectional online survey. Image credit: Gera Photo/Shutterstock.com

Researchers at King's College London and their collaborators have recently explored the experiences of teachers who deliver smoking and vaping prevention materials to secondary school students in Great Britain (GB).

The study, which is published in PLOS ONE, suggests the potential effectiveness of smoking prevention programs in improving teachers' knowledge about vaping and smoking and changing vaping harm perceptions among students.

The usage of electronic cigarettes, commonly known as vaping, has increased among adolescents and young adults in GB over the past decade. Although vaping is commonly perceived as less harmful than smoking, biomarker and observational studies indicate that vaping exposes young people to nicotine and other potentially harmful toxicants, and long-term vaping may have adverse health outcomes. Regular exposure to nicotine through vaping can also induce addictive behaviors among young people.

In GB, several youth vaping prevention campaigns have been initiated to increase awareness about potential health adversities and restrain youth from using electronic-cigarettes (e-cigarettes).

The majority of these campaigns focus on potential health risks of vaping, which may help reduce vaping in youth, but at the same time may increase misperceptions that vaping is equally or more harmful than smoking. Such misperceptions may, in turn, increase the likelihood of smoking, which is a more harmful behavior. Vaping prevention campaigns should therefore be designed carefully to prevent the spread of misperceptions. 

INTENT is an evidence-based smoking prevention program in GB that targets secondary school students. The program is based on implementation intentions, which are “if-then” plans that specify how, where, and when to perform a behavior. This type of plan serves as a self-regulatory approach to increase the likelihood of achieving goal-directed behaviors. Existing evidence suggests that INTENT was previously found to weaken the association between vaping and subsequent smoking among school students.  

Given concerns about youth vaping among local authorities and teachers, as well as the lack of evidence-based educational materials on vaping in GB, INTENT was expanded in 2022 to include information on vaping-related health risks (INTENT youth vaping prevention materials).

The current survey, led by researchers from King's College London, aimed to explore the experiences of teachers who deliver the INTENT youth vaping prevention materials to school students in England and Scotland.

The INTENT vaping prevention materials comprised four session plans, covering the health impact of vaping and smoking, social influences on vaping, environmental implications of vaping, and addiction.

A total of 45 teachers were surveyed online in 2024. They were recruited from 10 schools across four regions of England and Scotland, so the sample was not nationally representative. The primary objective of the survey was to collect self-reported information about teachers' experiences of delivering INTENT materials in schools, their perceptions about the impact of INTENT on students, and their perceptions about levels of vaping and smoking in schools.

More than 50% of teachers who participated in the survey reported that their students possess or use e-cigarettes at least once a week. About 96% of teachers perceived vaping as a problem in their schools.

About 96% of teachers reported very or somewhat positive experiences about delivering INTENT materials. Regarding reasons for delivery, approximately 89% of respondents reported that these materials are important for teaching students about vaping, 58% expressed concerns about vaping in schools, and 53% specified the requirement to teach about vaping as part of school policy.

Regarding the effectiveness of INTENT materials, the majority of teachers reported a change in their perception about vaping harm, although misperceptions that vaping is equally or more harmful than smoking remained high among them.

Regarding the impact of INTENT materials on students, most teachers reported that their students are engaged with the materials and that the materials encourage students to make informed choices about vaping. However, about 36% of teachers perceived that these materials had no effect on their students' vaping habits, and 31% reported that they did not know whether there was any change.

This survey is the first of its kind to assess teachers' experiences with vaping and the delivery of vaping prevention materials to school students in GB. Most of the studies in this topic have been conducted in the U.S. and Canada.

The survey findings reveal that the INTENT youth vaping prevention materials have the potential to change perceptions of teachers about vaping harm and encourage students to make informed choices about vaping. These findings highlight the feasibility of implementing INTENT or similar programs in schools to improve youth health.

Notably, the survey finds that misperceptions about vaping being equally or more harmful than smoking persist among a group of teachers even after going through the INTENT materials. In this context, researchers noted that since they were unable to collect data before delivering the materials, pre- and post-intervention analyses could not be conducted. There remains a possibility that harm perceptions were already higher before the delivery of INTENT, particularly since vaping misperceptions are pervasive among teachers and in the general population.

Pre- and post-intervention studies are therefore required to evaluate the effectiveness of INTENT materials in improving teachers' and students' knowledge about vaping harm and changing students' vaping behaviors.

Shift Bioscience (Shift), a biotechnology company uncovering the biology of cell rejuvenation to end the morbidity and mortality of aging, today announced the release of new research detailing an improved framework for evaluating benchmark metric calibration in virtual cell models. Using well-calibrated metrics, the study demonstrates that virtual cell models consistently outperform key baselines, providing valuable and actionable biological insights to accelerate target identification pipelines.

Genetic perturbation response models are a subset of AI virtual cells used to predict how cells will respond to various genetic alterations, including up- and down-regulation of genes. These models are a valuable tool to augment target identification pipelines, providing a rapidly scalable, in silico solution to identify promising genetic targets without the time and resource requirements of wet lab experiments. However, recently published papers have questioned the utility of these models to correctly identify gene targets, noting concerns that virtual cell models fail to outperform simple, uninformative baselines in some experiments.

In this latest study from Shift Bioscience, the team demonstrated that incidents of poor model performance largely reflect metric miscalibration, with commonly-used metrics routinely failing to distinguish robust predictions from uninformative ones, particularly in datasets with weaker perturbations. Building on this finding, the team developed an improved framework for metric calibration. Using 14 perturb-seq datasets, the team identified several rank-based and DEG (Differentially Expressed Gene)-aware metrics that are well-calibrated across datasets.

Virtual cell models evaluated using these well-calibrated metrics were able to consistently outperform uninformative mean, control and linear baselines, providing clear evidence that virtual cell models can distinguish biologically significant signals when appropriate calibration is applied. These results challenge prior reports that genetic perturbation models do not work, and suggest that AI Virtual Cells can be effectively applied for target discovery.

This latest research from our talented team provides clear evidence that the reports of poor performance in AI virtual cells is largely due to limitations of metrics, not due to issues with the models. We showed that when models are evaluated on well-calibrated metrics, they perform quite well and consistently outperform key baselines. We believe that this work opens the door to more widespread use of virtual cells and reinforces our confidence in the virtual cell models that are helping to drive our target identification program for cell rejuvenation."

Researchers have long established that hormones significantly affect the brain, creating changes in emotion, energy levels, and decision-making. However, the intricacies of these processes are not well understood. 

A new study by a team of scientists focusing on the female hormone estrogen further illuminates the nature of these processes. In a series of experiments with laboratory rats, it finds that the neurological mechanisms underlying learning and decision-making naturally fluctuate over the female reproductive cycle due to previously undetected molecular changes related to dopamine, which broadcasts the "reward" signals that guide learning throughout the brain.

The work is reported in the journal Nature Neuroscience.

Despite the broad influence of hormones throughout the brain, little is known about how these hormones influence cognitive behaviors and related neurological activity. There is a growing realization in the medical community that changes in estrogen levels are related to cognitive function and, specifically, psychiatric disorders."

Christine Constantinople, professor in New York University's Center for Neural Science and the paper's senior author

"Our results provide a potential biological explanation that bridges dopamine's function with learning in ways that better inform our understanding of both health and disease," adds Carla Golden, an NYU postdoctoral fellow and the paper's lead author.

The study, which also included researchers from NYU Grossman School of Medicine's Neuroscience Institute and Virginia Commonwealth University's Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, examined the neurological activity of laboratory rats in response to a series of experiments. 

In them, the rodents successfully reached a "reward"-in this case, a water source-after learning the significance of audio cues, which signaled the water's availability and volume. 

Overall, the rats' learning capabilities were enhanced when estrogen levels were increased. This happens, the authors write, because estrogen boosts dopamine activity in the brain's reward center, making reward signals stronger. 

By contrast, when estrogen activity was suppressed, curbing its ability to regulate dopamine, learning capabilities were diminished-and pointed to a potential connection between hormone levels and symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. Importantly, the researchers note, cognitive decision making was not affected by estrogen activity-the effect was specific to learning.

"All neuropsychiatric disorders show fluctuations in symptom severity over hormonal states, suggesting that a better understanding of how hormones influence neural circuits might reveal what causes these diseases," observes Constantinople. 

This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (DP2MH126376, F32MH125448, 5T32MH019524, 1S10OD010582-01A1), the National Cancer Institute (P30CA016087), NYU Langone Health, and the Simons Foundation.

Researchers at the University of Southampton have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that can spot hard-to-see objects lodged in patients' airways better than expert radiologists.

In a study published in npj Digital Medicine, the AI model outperformed radiologists in checking CT scans for objects that don't show up well on scans.

These accidentally inhaled objects can cause coughing, choking, difficulty breathing and sometimes lead to more serious complications if not treated properly.

The findings highlight how AI can support doctors in diagnosing complex and potentially life-threatening conditions.

The research has been led by Dr Yihua Wang, Dr Zehor Belkhatir, and Prof Rob Ewing at the University of Southampton in partnership with researchers from Wuhan, China.

"These objects can be extremely subtle and easy to miss, even for experienced clinicians," said PhD Researcher Zhe Chen, co-first author of the study from the University of Southampton.

"Our AI model acts like a second set of eyes, helping radiologists detect these hidden cases earlier and more reliably."

Foreign body aspiration (FBA) occurs when an object, often food or a small piece of material, becomes lodged in the airways.

When the objects, such as plant material or crayfish shells, are radiolucent (invisible on X-rays and faint even on CT scans), it can be very difficult to detect. This often leads to missed or delayed diagnoses, putting patients at risk of serious complications. Up to 75 per cent of FBA cases in adults involve radiolucent foreign bodies.

To address this challenge, the research team created a deep learning model. It combines a high-precision airway mapping technique (MedpSeg) with a neural network that analyses CT images for hidden signs of foreign bodies.

The model was trained and tested using three independent patient groups, consisting of over 400 patients, in collaboration with hospitals in China.

To put the model to the test, researchers compared its performance to that of three expert radiologists, each with over ten years of clinical experience. The task was to examine 70 CT scans, 14 of which were cases of radiolucent FBA, confirmed by bronchoscopy.

When the radiologists detected a case of radiolucent FBA, they did so with total precision – there were no false positives. In comparison, the AI model did so with 77 per cent precision, detecting some false positives.

However, the radiologists missed a large portion of FBA cases, identifying just 36 per cent of them and highlighting the difficulty humans have in spotting such cases. The AI model, on the other hand, was able to spot 71 per cent of cases, meaning far fewer FBA cases slipped through the net.

In F1 score, which balances precision and recall, the model outperformed the radiologists with a score of 74 per cent vs 53 per cent.

The results demonstrate the real-world potential of AI in medicine, particularly for conditions that are difficult to diagnose through standard imaging." 

Dr. Yihua Wang, lead author of the study

The researchers emphasise that the system is designed to assist, not replace, radiologists - providing an additional layer of confidence in complex or uncertain cases.

The researchers now aim to conduct multi-centre studies with larger and more diverse populations to improve the model and reduce the risk of bias.

The paper Automated Detection of Radiolucent Foreign Body Aspiration on Chest CT Using Deep Learning is published in npj Digital Medicine and is available online.

The research was supported by the UK Medical Research Council and the China Scholarship Council.

A new review uncovers how the prized truffle's unique mix of antioxidants, polysaccharides, and sterols could make it more than a gourmet delicacy, positioning it as a potential ally in nutrition, medicine, and sustainable food innovation.



Bioactive Compounds and Antioxidant Potential of Truffles: A Comprehensive Review. Image Credit: kaicairone / Shutterstock

In a recent review published in the journal Antioxidants, researchers in Italy synthesized existing knowledge about the bioactive compounds in truffles and their biological properties. Their conclusions emphasize the potential of truffles as functional foods and natural sources of antioxidants.

The study also emphasizes the importance of advanced extraction and storage methods in preserving the bioactive integrity and quality.

Truffles, the underground fruiting bodies of ectomycorrhizal fungi, are valued for their aroma, rarity, and nutritional richness. The review examined species from the genera Tuber, Terfezia, Tirmania, and Picoa, which support rural economies and forest ecosystems across North America, North Africa, Europe, and Asia.

Beyond their culinary importance, truffles possess significant biochemical diversity, making them promising candidates for functional food and therapeutic applications.

Recent discoveries, including an endogenous endocannabinoid system and novel polysaccharides, expand their pharmacological relevance. Technological advances in extraction and preservation now enable their use in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical formulations, broadening their market scope beyond gastronomy.

Truffles are rich in carbohydrates and proteins but low in fats and fibers, providing essential minerals such as iron, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, and potassium. Their lipid fraction, although limited, is dominated by unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic and linoleic acids, and sterols like ergosterol and brassicasterol, which support antioxidant and cholesterol-lowering effects.

Structural polysaccharides, including β-glucans and heteropolysaccharides, exhibit immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties that are influenced by their molecular characteristics.

Phenolic compounds, such as cinnamic, coumaric, and gallic acids, and flavonoids like kaempferol and catechin, confer strong antioxidant capacity.

Desert truffles (Terfezia, Tirmania, Picoa) are richer in vitamin C, folate, vitamin E, and β-carotene, while European black and white truffles contribute B-vitamins and vitamin D precursors derived from ergosterol.

Notably, Tuber melanosporum contains the endocannabinoid anandamide, which may act as an olfactory attractant for mammal-mediated spore dispersal.

Truffles offer high-quality, digestible proteins that contain all essential amino acids, with glutamate and sulfur-containing amino acids contributing to their distinctive umami flavor.

Bioactive peptides exhibit antioxidant, antihypertensive, and immune-regulatory effects. The characteristic aroma arises from volatile sulfur compounds, such as bis(methylthio)methane in white truffles and 1-octen-3-ol in black truffles, combined with aldehydes, ketones, and phenolic derivatives responsible for distinctive earthy or garlicky notes.

Truffle extracts exhibit a diverse range of biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective, and anticancer effects. Terfezia claveryi extracts show hepatoprotective activity against CCl₄-induced toxicity, while certain Tuber and Terfezia species demonstrate anticancer properties via caspase-3 activation and HER2 oncogene suppression.

Additionally, truffle-derived compounds reduce oxidative stress, inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria, and protect hepatic and neural tissues through immune enhancement and the induction of apoptosis.



Bioactivities and health-promoting properties of truffles. Schematic representation of the main biological activities attributed to truffles and their bioactive compounds. Truffle-derived molecules, including polysaccharides, polyphenols, sterols, carotenoids, and terpenoids, exert multiple health-promoting effects. These properties include antimicrobial/antiviral activity, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, hepatoprotective functions, and antitumor potential. Such pleiotropic effects highlight the relevance of truffles not only as culinary delicacies but also as promising sources of nutraceutical and therapeutic agents. 

Preserving truffle bioactivity depends on efficient extraction and storage processes. Conventional solvent and Soxhlet extractions often expose heat-sensitive compounds, such as phenolics and volatiles, to degradation.

Modern green extraction methods, including ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), pressurized liquid extraction (PLE), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), and supercritical CO₂ extraction, enhance yield and purity while preserving antioxidant and sterol content. UAE and enzymatic pretreatment optimize polysaccharide recovery, whereas PLE efficiently isolates β-glucans and ergosterol under mild conditions.

Analytical techniques, such as headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME), enable the non-destructive identification of volatile compounds while maintaining their chemical integrity.

Post-harvest storage significantly impacts truffle composition and shelf life. Low-temperature storage and freezing slow spoilage but may alter aromatic compounds. Lyophilization best preserves bioactivity when combined with antioxidants or cryoprotectants.

Modified atmosphere packaging and edible coatings, such as chitosan or gum Arabic, minimize oxidation and microbial growth. Encapsulation using β- or γ-cyclodextrin and nano/microcarriers stabilizes volatile and antioxidant compounds. 

Gentle technologies, including irradiation and high-pressure processing, extend freshness without compromising chemical integrity, ensuring truffles remain viable for food, nutraceutical, and pharmaceutical applications.

Due to their antimutagenic, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory properties, truffles are gaining traction in the formulation of dietary supplements, dairy-based functional foods, and beverages.

Their extracts are increasingly utilized in cosmetics and perfumery due to their antioxidant and aromatic profiles. While most data are preclinical, future clinical trials and standardized extraction protocols will be crucial for validating therapeutic claims and ensuring reproducibility across products.

As demand increases, sustainability is critical, particularly for wild species such as Tuber magnatum, which face overharvesting pressures. Promoting sustainable cultivation practices, integrating traditional ecological knowledge, and advancing bioengineering approaches are essential for long-term viability.

Future research should focus on optimizing extraction and encapsulation technologies to enhance bioavailability and stability. 

Ultimately, truffles represent not only gourmet delicacies but also emerging functional foods with potential preventive and therapeutic applications across the food, nutraceutical, and pharmaceutical industries.

Researchers at the University of Southampton have identified a new subtype of lymphoma which could pave the way to improved and more targeted treatments for some blood cancer patients.

The cancer scientists and biologists have also found that lymphoma cells of this new subtype carry a unique sugar that promotes the survival and growth of the cancer.

Lymphoma is a type of blood cancer that affects white blood cells called lymphocytes. There are many different types of lymphoma, but this latest breakthrough is in a type called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which affects our B cells. When operating normally, B cells help to fight infection in the body.

Within DLBCL, the researchers have now discovered a new subtype named 'Mann-type DLBCL'.

The team, who worked with researchers in Canada and the United States, have described their findings in a recently published paper in the journal Blood.

Lead researcher Professor Francesco Forconi of the University of Southampton's Cancer B-cell Group says: "Patients with this new subtype, Mann-type DLBCL, have a high-risk cancer that cannot respond well to conventional therapies, so identifying this as a distinct group is very important to their treatment programme.

"Understanding the type of cancers we fight is a crucial part of battling the disease and opens the door to developing new and improved therapies."

The scientists analysed data from 595 DLBCL patients, accessed through two separate cohort datasets of DLBCL from the BC Cancer Agency (BCCA) de-novo DLBCL cohort and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) DLBCL. They looked for a specific sugar called mannose on the key B-cell receptor and successfully identified it in around a third of all DLBCL.

The researchers found that Mann-type DLBCL lymphoma cells always carry this sugar and are not sensitive to conventional anti-cancer drugs. Mannose is found naturally on the surface of many infective agents like viruses, but is typically not abundant on normal human cells.

The sugar's presence helps the cancer cells to survive and grow more quickly, making them resistant to standard treatments – eventually resulting in an aggressive form of cancer and poorer outcomes for patients.

It is highly unusual to see these kinds of carbohydrates play such a defining role in cancer biology. Finding mannose structures driving tumour growth is remarkable and a powerful example of how interdisciplinary science, combining molecular insight with clinical data, can transform our understanding of disease."

This research to identify Mann-type DLBCL means doctors can now recognise specific cases of this type more easily using conventional laboratory tests. The breakthrough means the scientists can now work to find more effective, tailored treatments for this subtype and help provide better patient outcomes.

An umbrella review finds that studies suggesting a link between prenatal paracetamol exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders are limited by bias and weak methodology, with stronger analyses showing no clear causal link.



Maternal paracetamol (acetaminophen) use during pregnancy and risk of autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder in offspring: umbrella review of systematic reviews. Image Credit: Skylines / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), researchers analyzed the quality, validity, and biases in existing evidence linking maternal paracetamol (acetaminophen) use during pregnancy with the risk of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children.

Paracetamol is one of the most commonly used medications during pregnancy. In September 2025, the president of the United States publicly advised against the use of Tylenol (acetaminophen) in pregnancy, citing autism risk in children. In response, medical authorities and regulatory health agencies worldwide reaffirmed the established safety of paracetamol during pregnancy, emphasizing that current evidence does not support such warnings.

While several systematic reviews have explored associations between prenatal paracetamol exposure and neurodevelopmental outcomes such as ADHD and ASD, the findings vary considerably in quality and interpretation. Many primary studies fail to account for key confounders, such as maternal health conditions, genetic factors, and family environment, thereby limiting the ability to draw causal conclusions about in utero exposure.

The BMJ study systematically evaluated the strength and validity of available evidence. Researchers searched major databases, including Embase, Medline, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PsycINFO, Epistemonikos, and grey literature sources, to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses on maternal paracetamol use and child neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Eligible reviews included cohort, cross-sectional, case-control studies, or randomized trials examining prenatal exposure and risk of ADHD or ASD. Titles and abstracts were screened, followed by full-text evaluation. The quality of the review was assessed using the AMSTAR-2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2) framework.

From 663 identified records, nine systematic reviews encompassing 40 primary studies met the inclusion criteria, including four meta-analyses. Most reviews were published within the past decade and focused on maternal use throughout pregnancy. Only one examined both antenatal and postnatal exposure.

The quality evaluation revealed significant methodological deficiencies. Most reviews lacked registered protocols, comprehensive search strategies, and justifications for study exclusions. Risk of bias assessments were either incomplete or missing, and none utilized standardized tools such as the ROBINS-I or ROBINS-E. Statistical methods were often inadequate, with only one review pooling adjusted estimates. As a result, overall confidence was rated low in two reviews and critically low in seven.

All reviews reported positive associations between prenatal paracetamol exposure and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, with pooled odds ratios or relative risks for ADHD ranging from 1.2 to 1.4, and smaller associations for ASD. Sensitivity analyses showed stronger associations with longer or third-trimester exposure. However, sibling-controlled analyses, which accounted for shared familial and genetic factors, attenuated these associations to null. This suggests that observed relationships likely stem from familial or unmeasured confounding rather than a causal drug effect.

Moreover, overlap among primary studies was high (23%), further limiting interpretability. Seven reviews explicitly cautioned against drawing causal conclusions, emphasizing that apparent risks may reflect study bias and design limitations rather than true biological effects.

The collective evidence indicates a weak, non-causal link between maternal paracetamol use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring. Most systematic reviews failed to meet methodological standards necessary for high-confidence conclusions.

The BMJ umbrella review concludes that the existing body of evidence does not demonstrate a clear association between prenatal paracetamol exposure and ADHD or ASD. Apparent associations in whole-cohort studies are likely attributable to familial or unmeasured confounding factors rather than a direct pharmacologic effect.

A research team including a scientist of Earth-Life Science Institute (ELSI) at Institute of Science Tokyo, Japan, has identified a novel principle in biology that mathematically explains why the growth of organisms slows as nutrients become more abundant-a phenomenon known as "the law of diminishing returns."

Understanding how living organisms grow under various nutritional environments has long been a central question in biology. Across microbes, plants, and animals, growth is shaped by the availability of nutrients, energy, and cellular machinery. While extensive research has explored these limitations, most studies focus only on individual nutrients or specific biochemical reactions, leaving a broader question unanswered: how do complex, interconnected cellular processes collectively regulate growth under constrained conditions?

To address this, a research team consisting of ELSI's Specially Appointed Associate Professor Tetsuhiro S. Hatakeyama and RIKEN Special Postdoctoral Researcher Jumpei F. Yamagishi has discovered a unifying principle that explains how all living cells regulate growth when resources are limited. Their study introduces the global constraint principle for microbial growth, a concept that could transform how scientists approach the study of biological systems.

For nearly eight decades, researchers have relied on the "Monod equation" in microbiology, formulated in the 1940s, to describe microbial growth. According to the Monod equation, growth rates increase with an increase in nutrients before reaching a stable growth. However, the model assumes that only one nutrient or biochemical reaction restricts microbial growth. In fact, cells carry out thousands of interacting chemical processes, all competing for the same limited resources.

According to the team, the Monod equation captures only part of the picture. Rather than a single bottleneck, cellular growth is shaped by a network of constraints acting together, resulting in the familiar flattening of growth rates, though caused by an entirely different reason. The global constraint principle explains the fact that when one nutrient becomes more abundant, other factors such as enzyme availability, cell volume, or membrane capacity, begin to limit growth. Using a method called "constraint-based modeling" that models how cells manage their resources, the team showed that adding more nutrients always helps microbes grow, but each additional nutrient has a lower effect on growth than the previous one.

"The shape of growth curves emerges directly from the physics of resource allocation inside cells, rather than depending on any particular biochemical reaction," says Hatakeyama.

This new principle unites two classic biological laws: the Monod's equation, which describes microbial growth, and the Liebig's law of the minimum, which states that a plant's growth is limited by whichever nutrient is in shortest supply, such as nitrogen or phosphorus. In other words, even if a plant has plenty of most nutrients, it can only grow as much as the scarcest nutrient allows. By combining these concepts, the researchers created a "terraced barrel" model. In this model, different limiting factors take effect sequentially as nutrients increase. This explains why both microbes and higher organisms show diminishing returns and growth slows down even when more nutrients are added, because a new limiting factor becomes dominant.

Hatakeyama likens his theory to an updated version of Liebig's barrel, where a plant can only grow as much as its shortest stave (i.e., its most limited nutrient) allows. "In our model, the barrel staves spread out in steps," he explains, "each step representing a new limiting factor that becomes active as the cell grows faster."

To test their theory, the team used large-scale computer models of Escherichia coli, which include how the cells utilize proteins, how they are spatially packed, and the capacities of their membranes. The simulations showed the predicted slowing of growth as more nutrients were added and revealed how oxygen or nitrogen levels affect growth patterns. The results agreed well with lab experiments, confirming the model's accuracy.

The discovery provides a fresh perspective for looking at growth across all forms of life. Combining different principles, the global constraint principle explains complex biological behaviors without needing to model every single molecule in detail.

Our work lays the groundwork for universal laws of growth. By understanding the limits that apply to all living systems, we can better predict how cells, ecosystems, and even entire biospheres respond to changing environments."

Jumpei F. Yamagishi, RIKEN Special Postdoctoral Researcher

The significance of the research goes beyond basic biology. It may help improve microbial production in industry, increase crop yields by pinpointing limiting nutrients, and guide predictions of ecosystem responses under changing climates. Future studies could help explore how the principle applies to different organisms and the way multiple nutrients are used together. By connecting microbial biology with ecological theory, this study takes a major step towards a universal foundation for understanding the limits of life's growth.

A major global trial shows that starting evolocumab early, before a first heart attack or stroke, lowers cardiovascular risk and strengthens the case for aggressive LDL cholesterol reduction in primary prevention.



Study: Evolocumab in Patients without a Previous Myocardial Infarction or Stroke. Image Credit: Lightspring / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers assessed whether adding the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab to standard therapy reduces first major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) compared with placebo in adults with atherosclerosis or high-risk diabetes but without previous myocardial infarction or stroke.

One in three adults will face heart disease, yet many have never suffered a heart attack or stroke. This raises a crucial question: could earlier, deeper low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering prevent that first cardiovascular crisis? PCSK9 inhibitors reduce LDL levels far more effectively than statins, but most supporting data come from patients with established cardiovascular disease. Investigators therefore explored whether initiating therapy earlier could improve outcomes, reduce the need for invasive procedures, and alleviate long-term health burdens.

Early lipid-lowering may not only prevent acute events but also lower rates of hospitalization and intensive care admissions. Clinicians, families, and policymakers are increasingly interested in whether the earlier use of PCSK9 inhibitors could help patients maintain their health, reduce procedural demand, and preserve quality of life. Future research must further define the long-term safety, equity, and cost-effectiveness of early PCSK9-based interventions.

This international, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial included adults at high cardiovascular risk without prior myocardial infarction or stroke. Eligible participants had atherosclerosis or high-risk diabetes, were on stable lipid-lowering therapy, and had LDL cholesterol of at least 90 mg/dl or equivalent non-HDL or apolipoprotein B thresholds. Participants were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either subcutaneous evolocumab 140 mg every two weeks or a matching placebo, stratified by region and baseline LDL cholesterol.

Investigators and participants remained blinded to assignment. Two primary endpoints were prespecified:

Three-point MACE: coronary heart disease death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke

Four-point MACE, the same, plus ischemia-driven arterial revascularization

A blinded TIMI Clinical Events Committee adjudicated all outcomes. Lipid substudies measured biochemical effects, and Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The study included 12,257 participants, excluding 44 due to site irregularities. Follow-up spanned a median of 4.5 years. The trial was funded by Amgen (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03872401).

Among 12,257 randomized participants (median age 66 years, 43% women), 6,129 received evolocumab and 6,128 received placebo. About two-thirds had qualifying atherosclerosis without prior events, and 59% had diabetes. The median baseline LDL cholesterol level was 122 mg/dL, and most participants received statins, with 68% at high intensity. Evolocumab reduced LDL cholesterol by 55% versus placebo at 48 weeks, yielding a median on-treatment LDL of 45 mg/dl.

Evolocumab significantly reduced the risk of first cardiovascular events. Three-point MACE occurred in 336 evolocumab patients and 443 placebo patients, with a 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of 6.2% versus 8.0% (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.65–0.86; P<0.001). The four-point MACE endpoint occurred in 747 versus 907 patients (13.4% vs 16.2%; HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.73–0.89; P<0.001). Key secondary outcomes, including myocardial infarction alone (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.52–0.79), also favored evolocumab. Mortality endpoints were exploratory but numerically lower in the evolocumab group.

Efficacy was consistent across age, sex, race, geography, baseline LDL cholesterol quartiles, and background use of statins or ezetimibe. Fine-Gray competing-risk analyses confirmed the robustness of the primary findings. Although most participants were White (93%), the treatment benefit appeared uniform. Safety profiles were comparable between groups, with no excess in serious adverse events or treatment discontinuations. The magnitude of benefit mirrored the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration (CTTC) projections relating LDL reduction to event risk.

Adding evolocumab to optimized background therapy significantly lowered the risk of first MACE in adults with atherosclerosis or high-risk diabetes who had not yet suffered a myocardial infarction or stroke. Benefits were consistent across key clinical subgroups and achieved without new safety signals.

These findings reinforce the concept of earlier, intensive LDL cholesterol lowering to prevent initial cardiovascular crises, reduce procedural interventions, and maintain functional independence for patients while easing the burden on healthcare systems.

Cancer Center at Illinois (CCIL) Program Leader Erik Nelson's lab made an important discovery about the relationship between cholesterol and breast cancer progression with crucial implications for breast cancer therapeutics.

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death for American women, and more than 90% of breast cancer deaths are caused by metastatic spread of the disease. While breast cancer therapies have improved significantly in recent years, scientists do not yet understand the totality of molecular mechanisms involved in breast cancer progression and treatment resistance.

With previous knowledge in hand about an association between cholesterol and poor breast cancer outcomes, Nelson's team identified-with preclinical animal models-a cholesterol metabolite called hydroxycholesterol (27HC) that suppresses the ability of the immune system to attack cancer. They showed that 27HC worked on neutrophils-a type of immune cell-and stimulated the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs). However, they were not certain whether 27HC changed the communication between immune cells and cancer cells.

In their latest study, Nelson's team made a significant breakthrough: a line of communication used by neutrophil-EVs stimulates breast cancer progression. The findings are detailed in a paper in the journal Cancer Letters. Additional research collaborators from the CCIL include members Jefferson Chan and Wawrzyniec Dobrucki.

In our study, we described one of the axes used by neutrophil-EVs to stimulate breast cancer progression. 27HC 'tells' neutrophils what to put into EVs before sending them out. These customized neutrophil-EVs communicate with cancer cells themselves and instruct them to change their 'makeup.' The cancer cells then change to become more 'stem-like,' allowing them to become resistant to standard chemotherapies as well as spread (metastasize) to other organs."

Natalia Krawczynska, first author

Of the research results, Nelson said, "We show that EVs from neutrophils instruct cancer cells to engage in pathways making them resistant to chemotherapies. That means, if we can disrupt this process, we can offer a solution to patients with current metastatic disease-making their current medications work better."

Based on these findings, the team will now start working on developing new treatment strategies focused on disrupting this communication in the early stages of breast cancer, with the goal of decreasing the occurrence of breast cancer metastasis.

"Given that technology allows us to diagnose breast cancer at early stages, finding a way to prevent metastatic cancer before it clinically appears-by stopping the communication of neutrophil-EVs with cancer cells-might help stop the spread of cancer cells and metastatic disease," added Krawczynska.

Nelson's lab will now evaluate how they can modulate this communication to boost current breast cancer treatment strategies. This will involve intense basic science research and pre-clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of various existing compounds. In addition-given the relatively new field of EVs-they plan to collaborate with chemists to screen and develop new compounds with the potential to alter EV communication with cancer cells.

Additionally, the lab will evaluate different cues from diets, drugs, or human biology that might also alter this neutrophil-EVs communication in cancer. "We want to investigate how neutrophil-EVs impact other cells directly, or via a 'telephone game' mechanism within the tumor microenvironment, influencing cancer progression," said Krawczynska.

This comprehensive investigation will leverage interdisciplinary expertise of biologists like Nelson, engineers, chemists, and computational biologists. Thankfully, the CCIL is ideally situated at the nexus of these research strengths.

From here, Nelson's lab plans to establish collaborations with clinicians and patients to start investigating whether monitoring of EVs in the blood could predict metastatic recurrence in breast cancer patients. This project has potential to open a new way for early preventative strategies, ultimately improving cancer patients' outcomes.

"Our work provides fundamental insight into how immune cells talk with cancer cells, and how that can be hijacked by a cholesterol metabolite," said Nelson of this study's significance. "This discovery offers hope, because we found that when the 'message' is eliminated, the cancer cells can revert to being more stationary and sensitive to medications, and thereby more effective," said Nelson.

Chelsea skipper Reece James has sent a warning to FIFA ahead of the 2026 World Cup as he urged the football's governing body to rethink kick-off times to protect players from potentially "dangerous" heat conditions. The 25-year-old defender, who lifted the Club World Cup with Chelsea in the United States earlier this year, described the sweltering temperatures during the tournament as "super difficult" and believes that matches played in similar conditions next summer could put players' health at risk.

A recent study by Queen's University Belfast found that 14 of the 16 stadiums hosting matches in North America could reach or exceed temperatures deemed unsafe for prolonged physical activity. During Chelsea's pre-tournament training sessions in Philadelphia, the team faced a severe heat warning with temperatures hitting 37°C and humidity levels pushing the perceived temperature closer to 45°C. The club's Argentine midfielder Enzo Fernandez nearly collapsed during the game against Fluminense. He later revealed that he "felt dizzy" and needed medical attention midway through the game. 

 "Thank you for asking that question, because honestly, the heat is incredible," he said. "The other day, I got a bit dizzy during a play and had to go down to the ground. Playing in this kind of temperature is very dangerous. Especially for the spectacle as well, for the people who come to enjoy the game at the stadium, and for those watching at home. The pace of the game isn't the same; everything slows down a lot. Hopefully next year they change the schedule at least, so that it's more of a show, and football stays beautiful and exciting."

James echoed those concerns and believes the solution lies in rescheduling kick-off times to cooler evening hours, especially for the games staged in southern and central US states. 

"It's super difficult conditions to play in that heat, especially us playing in England - there's not anything like that before," said James. "Later kick-offs when it's not so hot and humid. That would definitely help. For sure, that would definitely help."

When asked if FIFA had got in touch with him for any feedback, he replied, "No, I haven't been asked about my thoughts on kick-off times. I'm sure they will have asked someone. Maybe managers or people at the clubs. I'm sure they will have got some feedback."

According to The BBC, FIFA is considering late-night kick-offs for matches involving major European nations to mitigate the heat issue. This could mean start times mirroring the Club World Cup's schedule, with games at 17:00, 20:00, 23:00 and even 02:00 BST. Such timings would help avoid the worst of the afternoon sun in the US while also catering to international TV audiences. 

"You feel the heat the minute you step outside the hotel. The conditions are super hot," James continued. "Once you are out there you adapt the longer you are there, when you are settled in once place and try to limit the things you can. The pitches when we were there weren't the greatest either and made it a little bit harder but hopefully by the time the World Cup comes around hopefully it's better."

England have already secured qualification with two games to spare, and preparations are underway for the unique climate challenge that awaits them across the pond. Assistant coach Anthony Barry confirmed that the team will hold a warm-weather training camp in Florida to help players acclimatise to the conditions. Players will also undergo specific fitness conditioning to cope with the intense humidity that can sap energy and concentration. 

Concerns over player welfare in extreme temperatures are nothing new. The 2022 Qatar World Cup was moved to winter to avoid similar risks, but this time, with matches spread across three countries and multiple time zones, the challenge remains unprecedented. Cooling breaks will be an important tool to counter the heat, but more exhaustive measures are required to ensure player safety.

2026 World

Cup Countdown

FIFA hiked ticket prices for dozens of 2026 World Cup games ahead of the second phase of sales, which began Wednesday.

The initial prices, described last month by fan groups as “super high,” “astonishing” and “unacceptable,” were already multiple times higher than those at previous World Cups. But, sensing strong demand, FIFA raised the cost of many tickets to new record-setting heights — the first large-scale implementation of its “variable pricing” strategy.

The price of a Category 1 ticket to the 2026 World Cup final, the most expensive non-hospitality ticket, jumped from $6,730 last month to over $7,000 this month, according to multiple fans who gained access to pricing data.

The cost of upper-deck tickets to the final also rose, with most now priced at $5,055 (up from $4,210 last month) or $3,450 (up from $2,790).

Prices for many group stage games in the United States stayed stagnant. But tickets for the games in Mexico and Canada, which generally sold quicker in last month's “Visa Presale” phase, got more expensive across the board, with some prices rising by around 25%, according to screenshots and data seen by The Athletic.

And in the knockout rounds, prices for every single match jumped in at least one category. For the first semifinal at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, a Category 1 ticket now costs $3,295 (up from $2,780 at the start of the previous phase). A Category 2 ticket is $2,350 (up from $1,920) and a Category 3 ticket is $930 (up from $720).

In most stadiums, according to color-coded maps embedded in FIFA's ticketing portal, Category 1 encompasses the entire lower bowl and most or all of the second deck. Category 2 is predominantly the upper deck along the sidelines, while Category 3 is the upper deck above either goal. Category 4 tickets appear to be extremely scarce — confined to the upper portion of a few corner sections in the upper decks of stadiums. (Fans buy tickets by category, and FIFA assigns the exact section, row and seat closer to the start of the tournament.)

FIFA has not said how many tickets are available in each category. In fact, soccer's global governing body has not communicated pricing details to the general public at all, as it did ahead of past World Cups. It has tightly guarded prices, and hasn't made executives available for interviews. It even refused to reveal prices to fans who bought the “right to buy” tickets and clamored for the transparency they'd been promised.

But on Wednesday, the ticket portal opened to a random selection of fans in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. They'd entered FIFA's second lottery, the “early ticket draw,” and won the opportunity to purchase tickets to World Cup games in their country during a so-called “domestic exclusivity period.”

After hours-long waits in digital queues, they saw and revealed prices. Among the other matches subject to price hikes were:

Prices for the U.S. opener at SoFi Stadium did not change — perhaps because those tickets did not sell as quick as others in the first sales phase. On Wednesday, they were still listed at:

But for the USMNT's game in Seattle on June 19, they rose by 13% in Category 1, 16% in Category 2 and 22% in Category 3, to:

Prices also rose for the USMNT's third game, to:

Prices for Mexico's opener, the very first game of the World Cup, rose by around 20%:

Most other tickets, at this stage, are still for matches between unknown teams. Most matchups and game locations will be determined on Dec. 5 at the World Cup draw and shortly thereafter when FIFA sets the schedule.

Soon after that, FIFA will open a third ticket lottery phase, and its variable pricing strategy will likely kick in again.

Gennaro Gattuso confirms that Gianluca Scamacca and Giacomo Raspadori will start for Italy against Moldova tomorrow, but feels World Cup qualifying in Europe ‘needs to change.'

The penultimate match in Group I kicks off at the Stadionul Zimbru in Chisinau on Thursday at 19.45 GMT.

Even with a victory here and in the final game with Norway at San Siro, it is still practically certain the Azzurri will finish runners-up due to overall goal difference.

“There is absolutely nothing easy about any games, don't forget the game in Reggio Emilia four months ago,” warned Italy coach Gattuso on Sky Sport Italia.

When these sides met in June, Raspadori and Andrea Cambiaso got the goals in a 2-0 victory, which was Luciano Spalletti's last on the bench.

“Many people have in their minds the fact that Norway beat Moldova 11-1, but these are not players who just ran away from home and found themselves on a pitch by accident. They have their own difficulties to deal with, but tomorrow will not be a walk in the park.”

With the showdown against Norway coming up and focus already shifting to the play-offs, the CT warns he is going to shake things up.

“There will be more than one change tomorrow, I want to see the improvement that I've been talking about for a while. There is nothing easy.”

Moise Kean and Nicolò Cambiaghi are among the players who pulled out due to injury, but Gattuso is not hiding his decisions.

“Scamacca and Raspadori will start in Moldova. Scamacca is lacking regular playing time and match fitness, so he mustn't try to over-do it. We know what he can give and his characteristics, he just needs to relax and play his game.”

Italy know that because of that opening 3-0 defeat in Oslo and Norway's incredible goal difference, they didn't stand a chance of recovering to top the group and secure automatic World Cup qualification.

Could a win against Norway increase confidence or boost their regrets?

“There are no regrets. Winning helps us to win, so that is up to us now,” replied Gattuso.

“We do have a few issues over the criteria, because if we look at South America where six out of 10 teams go directly to the World Cup and the seventh head into a play-off with a team from Oceania, that does give you regrets. That is the disappointment, the system needs to change in Europe.”

The Nazionale are therefore already looking ahead to the play-offs in March 2026, where they already stumbled in 2018 and 2022.

“I am honest, my mind is on tomorrow's game and not beyond that. I want to see improvement, how the players train and work together.

“In my view, just having this get-together was not an easy task. We've already qualified for the play-offs, there are little aches and pains. I have to thank the likes of Barella, Calafiori and Bastoni for being here, as it was by no means to be taken for granted.

“I congratulate the lads for their professionalism and hunger, which they show every day,” concluded Gattuso.

Thomas Tuchel faces some tough decisions ahead of next year's World Cup, with the England boss revealing some players will be omitted as they won't all fit into his playing system. The Three Lions head coach has warned a big-name trio they can't start a game together as he puts the final touches to his plans ahead of the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Many managers would love to enjoy the attacking options at Tuchel's disposal. The German boss possesses a wealth of talent, but faces the challenge of harmonising them effectively. Harry Kane remains the central figure, though Tuchel must decide how best to integrate other stars. Phil Foden offers versatility, while rising talents like Morgan Rogers and Cole Palmer (injured in recent weeks) challenge for creative midfield spots. The competition for places means the final attacking line-up for the World Cup is far from settled.  

The relationship between Tuchel and midfielder Jude Bellingham has been a notable issue. Bellingham was controversially left out of the October squad, with Tuchel citing a need for rhythm and team cohesion. The manager has also publicly commented on Bellingham's aggressive on-field demeanour, suggesting it can be "repulsive" and must be channelled constructively. Bellingham was recalled for the November games, but the saga highlights the pressure on the young dynamo to adapt to Tuchel's structured approach. And that could mean heartbreak for certain stars, with the German tactician saying Kane, Bellingham and Foden "cannot play" together.

Tuchel told talkSPORT: "At the moment, if we keep the structure, they cannot play. They can, but not in the structure, not for the balance that we developed. Not for the structure that also comes with wingers who are like specialists in their positions. At the moment, we play with a No. 6, a No. 8, a No. 10 and a No. 9. 

"There is a lot of congruence, especially in the No. 10 position, if you think about Phil can play there, you think about Jude, you think about Morgan Rogers who played fantastic for us in this position. You have Cole Palmer, you have Morgan Gibbs-White, so there are a lot of players, and there is the chance that we will not take everyone. Not because we don't like (them), not because they don't individually deserve it, but we will always do what's best for the team. We will always do what's best for winning, we will always do what's best for balance, and we will try to keep the clarity, even if it means that we have to take tough decisions. We take tough decisions in any camp, and this will not change when we go to a tournament."

When asked if this decision puts Foden's place under the most jeopardy, Tuchel replied: "Yes and no. If you're a unique player, you can play both positions. I think he can play the No.9, he can play the No.10, it gives him an advantage to compete for both positions. For Man City, he plays almost like a No.8/10, so maybe during the next months, we consider him as a No.8. But again, I see a very, very low percentage that we take five No.10s into a tournament, I don't see how this will help."

England have already qualified for the 2026 World Cup after securing a first-place finish in Group K with two matches to spare. The Three Lions have so far gone unbeaten in their qualification campaign by winning all six of their games and have two final qualifiers coming up against Serbia at Wembley on Thursday and Albania in Tirana on Sunday.

Nashville SC defender Walker Zimmerman is out of contract and will depart the club this winter, sources briefed on the situation told The Athletic.

Zimmerman is a club legend, a cornerstone from the club's inaugural match. He twice won MLS Defender of Year while in Nashville (2020, 2021) and will be one of the top defenders on the free agency market this winter.

Zimmerman led the club to the playoffs in five of the club's first six seasons and lifted Nashville's first trophy this year, the U.S. Open Cup.

Very poetic and fitting that it's Hany Mukhtar and Walker Zimmerman the first two to get their hands on the trophy and lifting it together https://t.co/0Gi6V8I332 pic.twitter.com/DBY6ocXGQn

— Tom Bogert (@tombogert) October 2, 2025



The 32-year-old signed a contract extension in 2022 making him a designated player, a kind of deal rare for a defender and one that underpinned his quality and importance to the team.

Zimmerman has made 172 appearances for Nashville, fifth-most in the club's short MLS history.

He has 46 caps for the U.S. men's national team, appearing in all four of his country's matches at the 2022 World Cup. Injuries slowed him a bit this year, but he was with the national team in the summer for the Gold Cup.

Zimmerman missed time this year due to a concussion, knee issue and national team duty, making 26 appearances across all competitions for Nashville. The club's season ended last weekend at the hands of Inter Miami in a 4-0 Game 3 defeat in the opening round of the playoffs.

Prior to being traded to Nashville ahead of 2020, Zimmerman started his career with FC Dallas and then was part of LAFC's first few years. He won the 2016 Supporters' Shield and U.S. Open Cup with Dallas, then the Shield with LAFC in 2019.

The departure opens up a DP spot for Nashville. The club has the flexibility to add a DP or open an additional U-22 initiative slot.

Canadian soccer in the winter? It's gritty.

With frigid winds and snow at Toronto FC's training ground on Monday, the Canadian men's national team fine-tuned for their final two matches of 2025, starting with Ecuador on Thursday night at BMO Field (7:30 pm ET).

The match is expected to feature the largest home crowd since the 2022 World Cup qualifying cycle, with 35,000 fans set to fill the stadium that will host Canada's 2026 FIFA World Cup opener next June.

“It's going to be amazing," LAFC midfielder Mathieu Choinière smirked in regards to next summer's tournament.

“We have a few months left, and we're building something. We're expecting a loud crowd here, and that's what we're gonna need for the World Cup as we try to bring everybody, the community, behind us, because they've been great so far.”

Even with the dropping temperatures, the goal remains clear: close out 2025 with two wins over South American opposition. Especially after October's 1-0 loss to Australia and scoreless draw vs. Colombia.

“I want everybody to start to feel that this team is good, that this team is exciting, that there's major potential in what can be achieved," said head coach Jesse Marsch.

“We want people to know that next summer, this is going to be a fun team to watch, and it's going to be a real event.”

Les Rouges expect to continue building connections, especially in midfield, where Choinière, Stephen Eustáquio, Ismaël Koné, Nathan Saliba, and Jonathan Osorio are vying to be the beating hearts of the 4-4-2.

“Soccer is all about chemistry and understanding each other. If you find that partnership in midfield, everything is just easy, and you know what the other guy next to you likes to do,” Choinière told MLSsoccer.com.

“It's just easier. Our system is clear, and it's been amazing. Whoever is next to me, I know I'm capable of adapting.”

With fleeting opportunities before the World Cup, opportunities to tinker are shrinking. Yet the November window matches on Thursday and Tuesday could potentially lead to more consistency.

The overarching message, though, is a continued build. While key injuries have hampered the squad, they have added two new dual nationals: Middlesbrough center back Alfie Jones and Huddersfield Town goalkeeper Owen Goodman.

“We don't have a lot of time to prepare, so we need to try to make sure that everybody's up to speed with exactly what we want to be like for Thursday, and then we can look at Venezuela,” Marsch said.

“Alfie Jones has fit in really well. He understands many of the football concepts we have, and he's a high-level player. Owen Goodman also has big potential to be a strong, athletic goalkeeper.”

Alfie Jones has quite the Matchday -1 with the #CanMNT tomorrow.He's set to take his citizenship oath and officially become a Canadian.Then he'll wear the red and white against Ecuador at BMO Field on Thursday.More to come. https://t.co/QHzoL4WHKz

The November window also falls at a tenuous time for some, especially the four players currently in the Audi 2025 MLS Cup Playoffs.

When the team came together earlier in the week, both Vancouver Whitecaps FC's Ali Ahmed and Jayden Nelson approached Choinière, saying “We got you, we got you,” according to the LAFC midfielder, ahead of the Western Conference Semifinal on Nov. 22 (9:30 pm ET | MLS Season Pass, Apple TV).

“Keep talking, we'll see when it comes,” Choinière responded.

“I haven't been speaking to [Choinière] much,” Nelson said. “It's football, but this is our focus now, and when we do go back to our clubs, we have to put that switch to a playoff mentality.”

Can't wait for this showdown. 🍿Everything you need to know about @WhitecapsFC vs. @LAFC in the Western Conference Semifinal of the Audi MLS Cup Playoffs:

For Choinière, in particular, the window marks a national team bookend to a transformative season. After struggling in Switzerland with Grasshopper Zurich, he's hit his stride alongside Son Heung-Min at LAFC, bringing confidence into national team camp and the rest of the playoffs.

“I learned a lot about myself in 2025, about how I want to play the game, what style and who I am as a player,” he said. “I think I'm more mature at the moment and in my style of play and what I need to do to help the team, so I found joy again in playing soccer with LAFC and now Canada.”

On Thursday against Ecuador, he and Canada expect a “similar challenge to Colombia,” but know the primary focus is on building their identity.

After wrapping up the November window, only March and June 2026 international windows remain, making every step critical – especially when it comes in front of a raucous home crowd.

“I think we were pretty effective against Colombia, and we were a little bit lucky not to give up a goal, but we were a little bit lucky not to get a goal, " added Marsch. “Ecuador will be a good match.

"We know they're very athletic, very individually talented, and that as a team, they don't give much away. So we'll be ready for it at home.”

The draw for the 2026 World Cup will take place on Friday, 5 December at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC, at 17:00 GMT (12:00 local time).

It will be the biggest World Cup yet, with 48 nations taking part - an expansion from 32.

The three host countries qualify automatically, while nations from other confederations have their own qualifying campaigns.

The first ever Fifa Peace Prize will also be awarded by the organisation's president Gianni Infantino on the day of the draw. 

The 2026 World Cup will take place in the USA, Mexico and Canada, between 11 June-19 July.

Send us your questions

The 48 participating teams will be placed into pots based on Fifa rankings and confederation constraints.

The teams will be divided into four pots of 12 teams. Each group will have one team drawn from each pot.

Pot one includes the host nations and the nine top countries in the Fifa world rankings.

Pots two, three and four will include the next-best ranked teams - so in theory, each group should be balanced. 

The teams representing the host counties will be assigned to positions A1- Mexico, B1 - Canada and D1 - USA.

Teams from the same confederation, apart from Uefa, cannot be drawn in the same group.

No more than two teams from Uefa will be in the same group.

Participants will be drawn into a group of four teams. There will be 12 groups in total.

As of 12 November 2025, here are the teams who have qualified for the 2026 World Cup:

Hosts: Canada, Mexico, United States

Africa: Algeria, Cape Verde, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia

Asia: Australia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Uzbekistan

Europe: England

Oceania: New Zealand

South America: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay

It has not been announced who will do the draw in Washington DC, but US President Donald Trump will join Fifa president Gianni Infantino at the event.

England international Reece James called out the weather and pitch conditions in the United States ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

James and Chelsea won the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the U.S. this past summer. The club captain made five appearances in the expanded competition, getting some first-hand experience of what the summer conditions would be like come 2026. 

Describing the “difficult” conditions, the 25-year-old insisted England are keeping the weather in mind when preparing for the tournament.

“It's been a key message that the conditions will be tough in the middle of the summer in America. Everyone is aware of that. We're trying to prepare as best we can for that,” James told assembled media at England's press conference on Wednesday.

“It's super difficult conditions to play in that heat. Especially for us playing in England, there's not anything like that before. Once you are out there you adapt the longer you are there, when you are settled in one place and try to limit the things you can.”

James revealed England plan on arriving to the U.S. early to get themselves acclimated to the environment.

Even more concerning was James restarting the pitch conditions conversation with less than seven months to go until the World Cup.

“The pitches when we were there weren't the greatest either and made it a little bit harder. But hopefully by the time the World Cup comes around it's better,” James admitted, though he did not specify which stadiums were of concern.

Chelsea played at four different stadiums in the Club World Cup, three of which will be in use at the 2026 international tournament.

England international Reece James called out the weather and pitch conditions in the United States ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

James and Chelsea won the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the U.S. this past summer. The club captain made five appearances in the expanded competition, getting some first-hand experience of what the summer conditions would be like come 2026. 

Describing the “difficult” conditions, the 25-year-old insisted England are keeping the weather in mind when preparing for the tournament.

“It's been a key message that the conditions will be tough in the middle of the summer in America. Everyone is aware of that. We're trying to prepare as best we can for that,” James told assembled media at England's press conference on Wednesday.

“It's super difficult conditions to play in that heat. Especially for us playing in England, there's not anything like that before. Once you are out there you adapt the longer you are there, when you are settled in one place and try to limit the things you can.”

James revealed England plan on arriving to the U.S. early to get themselves acclimated to the environment.

Even more concerning was James restarting the pitch conditions conversation with less than seven months to go until the World Cup.

“The pitches when we were there weren't the greatest either and made it a little bit harder. But hopefully by the time the World Cup comes around it's better,” James admitted, though he did not specify which stadiums were of concern.

Chelsea played at four different stadiums in the Club World Cup, three of which will be in use at the 2026 international tournament.

Barcelona presidential hopeful Xavier Vilajoana has accused Joan Laporta's board of “lying” about the club's financial situation and called for transparency over Lionel Messi's 2021 exit. A new independent report commissioned by the former board member claims that Barca's debt has ballooned to €4.12 billion, sparking questions about the club's claims of economic recovery and whether Messi's departure was really driven by finances at all.

The foundations of Laporta's presidency have come under renewed fire following the publication of the “Economic X-ray of FC Barcelona (2005-2025)” report - a detailed, independent analysis presented at the Foment de Treball headquarters in Barcelona. Commissioned by Vilajoana, a former Barca director and now potential presidential challenger, the study paints a worrying picture of the club's financial trajectory. According to the report, Barcelona's total debt has reached €4.12 billion, the highest in European football history, marking a 293% increase since 2021.

It directly challenges Laporta's long-standing narrative that his administration “saved” the club from economic collapse. The report claims that even excluding the Espai Barca project €2.82 billion, operational and financial debts still exceed €1.3 billion - more than what Laporta inherited from Josep Maria Bartomeu's regime.

Perhaps most damningly, it accuses the club of using €929 million from asset sales (TV rights, Barca Studios, VIP seats) to finance everyday operations rather than long-term recovery - a strategy that Vilajoana calls “deceptive and unsustainable.”

As pressure mounts, Vilajoana has demanded answers from Laporta, insisting that the club's financial story has been “twisted to mislead members.”

Speaking during the report's presentation, Vilajoana issued a scathing assessment of how the Laporta administration has handled finances, membership relations, and transparency.

He accused the board of covering up a worsening financial situation, saying: “In these four years, Laporta has sold nearly €900 million of inherited assets. Without that inheritance, accumulated losses would already exceed €1 billion, a figure equivalent to the total value of the current first-team squad.

“The economic data reveal a situation far more delicate than the president has publicly admitted. The study detects accounting manipulation practices intended to present a recovery that does not match the Club's financial reality.

“In total, more than €380 million would have been included in the accounts without a real basis, altering the perception of debt and results. These operations do not reduce actual debt; they only hide it. Pretending the numbers balance is not saving the club, it is deceiving it."

Among the most striking claims in Vilajoana's report is the suggestion that Messi's departure may not have been purely financial. The former Barca director called on Laporta to “finally tell the truth” about why the Argentine legend was allowed to leave.

“Messi's departure was based on financial reasons. It was said that the club couldn't afford the best player in the world. If the reason was financial, I don't see it anywhere now,” Vilajoana stated. “Let Laporta tell us the real reason why Messi was let go. Messi should be left alone. The club is his home, regardless of the president. It would be a mistake to try to take over a figure like him.”

He also used the report to highlight cuts to La Masia, which he argues have jeopardised Barcelona's most reliable long-term asset: “Laporta lives off La Masia's successes while reducing investment. Since his term began, he has cut La Masia's investment from €40m to €25m. If we are to learn anything from this economic disaster, it's that La Masia is Barca's best asset.”

While the report sharply criticises the club's leadership, Vilajoana's message was not one of despair but of renewal. He announced that he will formally present his electoral project on November 27, outlining an alternative vision built on transparency, accountability, and youth development. 

“If I run, it will be with the intention of proposing, explaining, and persuading,” he said. “I don't like 'Frankenstein' projects everyone should forge their own path. I'm going to work on mine.”

Closing his address, Vilajoana expressed cautious optimism that the club can recover if leadership changes course: “I'm optimistic because we'll deal with it when we can. Barca has a solution, but it requires will and responsibility. What we can't do is say that everything is fantastic for four years.”

As Barcelona prepare for next summer's elections, the controversy surrounding Messi's departure and Laporta's financial stewardship is certain to dominate the campaign trail. Whether Laporta chooses to respond to the accusations or continue to deflect remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Barca's financial narrative is once again under the microscope.

England defender Reece James said his teammates must brace for “super difficult conditions” at the 2026 World Cup in North America having experienced intense summer heat during Chelsea's Club World Cup campaign earlier this year.

James, who captained Chelsea at the Club World Cup held in the United States from June 14 to July 13, playing through a heatwave in Philadelphia and thunderstorms in Charlotte, said England are readying for the World Cup heat next summer.

The 48-team showpiece event will feature 104 matches across 16 host cities in Canada, Mexico and the United States. Dallas, Houston, Miami, Atlanta, Monterrey, and Guadalajara, where June and July temperatures often exceed 33°C (91°F), will be tough to endure.

“Everyone is aware of that. We are trying to prepare as best we can for that. It's super difficult conditions to play in that heat. Especially for us playing in England, there's not anything like that before,” James told reporters on Tuesday.

“You feel the heat the minute you step outside the hotel. Once you are out there you adapt the longer you are there, when you are settled in one place and try to limit the things you can. Later kick-offs when it's not so hot and humid, that would definitely help.

Matches in venues such as Vancouver, Seattle, San Francisco and Toronto are expected to offer milder conditions at next year's finals. However, the 25-year-old James noted that poor pitch quality compounded the weather challenges.

“The pitches when we were there weren't the greatest either and made it a little bit harder but hopefully by the time the World Cup comes around it's better,” he added.

England host Serbia on Thursday and visit Albania on Sunday in their last two World Cup qualifiers.

Reece James has joked he'll avoid another awkward trophy presentation with Donald Trump if the opportunity arises next summer with England.

The US President's unexpected appearance at Chelsea's Club World Cup celebrations went viral following last summer's tournament. The Chelsea captain was on stage as Trump inserted himself into the presentation ceremony before Cole Palmer visibly reacted to the spectacle.

However, James laughed off the incident, insisting that if a similar situation occurred and England lifted the World Cup next summer, he would let Harry Kane handle it. The England defender smiled: "No, I don't have a plan. I'll leave that to Harry!"

Trump attended as FIFA's special guest at the Club World Cup final last summer when Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain to claim the trophy at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, which will also host next year's final.

James captained Chelsea to victory in July and confesses he's hoping to replicate that achievement with England at the World Cup next summer, reports the Mirror.

James said:

"It's my dream, every young boy or girl's dream to be a world champion for their country. It's something I've dreamt of since I started playing, since I got selected for England. I feel we could go close.

"I don't think it's related that much. Club football and international football are slightly different. It's one year apart, a completely different squad, but we'll do our best."

James is confident that leadership, team spirit, and healthy competition are the key elements for success, and he's enjoyed working under his former Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, who now manages England.

He further stated:

"I think I know what I bring. There are many experienced players here, there are a lot of young players. I think the stronger we are as a group, the easier it is. The key to achieving what we want and getting success is having the group's togetherness – it's not one person's leadership.

"Competition is key to going close to winning things. In competitions you can't have a small squad. They need to keep players on their toes with everyone hungry and fire in their belly to want to win."

Despite Trump's odd interruption last summer, it didn't overshadow Chelsea's accomplishment, which held immense personal significance for James. "It's amazing for me. Since a little boy I supported this team," he expressed at the time.

"I just wanted to play for this club just once. That would have been enough for me. To captain the team and lead them to two trophies this season has been a dream for me."

Trump was front and centre as James lifted the Club World Cup for Chelsea

Reece James joked he is happy to sidestep a second meeting with Donald Trump and leave Harry Kane with the US President should England fulfil their World Cup dreams next summer.

The Chelsea captain found himself in the spotlight in July after Enzo Maresca's Blues shocked Champions League holders Paris Saint-Germain to win the Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium.

Trump presented James with the trophy alongside Fifa president Gianni Infantino, whose suggestion that the US President moved out the way for the ensuing celebrations was ignored.

There was bemusement among the delighted Blues, including their skipper who will gladly leave the trophy presentation to England captain Kane should they win the World Cup.

Asked if he has a plan regarding Trump should they triumph next summer, full-back James said with a smile: “I don't have a plan. I'll leave that to Harry.

“It's my dream, every young boy or girl's dream, to be a world champion for their country.

“It's something I've dreamt of since I started playing, since I got selected for England. I feel we could go close.”

James has also issued a warning to his England teammates of "super difficult conditions" at the World Cup having experienced intense summer heat during Chelsea's Club World Cup campaign.

The defender played through conditions at both ends of the extreme weather spectrum, tasked with dealing with a heatwave in Philadelphia as well as thunderstorms in Charlotte.

He said: "Everyone is aware of that. We are trying to prepare as best we can for that. It's super difficult conditions to play in that heat. Especially for us playing in England, there's not anything like that before.

"You feel the heat the minute you step outside the hotel. Once you are out there you adapt the longer you are there, when you are settled in one place and try to limit the things you can. Later kick-offs when it's not so hot and humid, that would definitely help.”

Sixteen stadiums across the United States, Canada and Mexico will host the FIFA World Cup in 2026, and the University of Tennessee at Knoxville is leading the research to ensure turf quality is pristine and consistent across all 104 matches next summer.

John Sorochan, a distinguished professor of turfgrass sciences and management at UT, said the university is in the "11th hour" of research as his team of faculty members, technicians and students prepare for the ultimate test after putting their work into practice earlier this year at the Club World Cup.

Sorochan, who's collaborating with Michigan State University, joined Knox News on an exclusive tour at the East Tennessee AgResearch and Education Center-Plant Sciences Unit, where FIFA has built a covered facility to replicate the conditions of five domed stadiums hosting the 2025 FIFA World Cup between June 11 and July 19.

Growing sod on plastic lets it develop roots, allowing UT and the growers to easily roll up the sod and place it in stadiums faster. This reduces stress on the grass and keeps growers from cutting the roots. Artificial fibers make up about 5% of the sod and provide stability as the grass grows, and each sod plot is about 2 inches thick. When combined with other technology to create a "shallow pitch," the sod can be assembled and disassembled in under 12 hours both ways. “We've come up with something that you can put in a temporary surface and still play at the highest quality level,” Sorochan said.

UT uses LED grow lights to simulate how turf will grow inside the five domed stadiums in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles and Vancouver. Sorochan and his team have tested how long the lights need to be shining − about 12 hours for a full field − and when they need to be turned on. The color of lighting is important, as various color wavelengths produce varying levels of energy. Blue sends out more energy in shorter waves to produce short, sturdy growth, while red is used as a stimulus whose longer waves help grass grow lusher.

Sorochan and research associate Kyley Dickson developed the fLEX machine after an NFL game set for Mexico City had to be relocated in 2018 because the field was deemed unsafe. Sorochan returned from the experience annoyed but inspired to find a way to test fields based on how athletes will come into contact with the ground while playing, including how cleats affect turf. “We developed a machine that would simulate a foot strike," he said. "I gave the charge to Kyley, and we sat and brainstormed over what would it need to look like and do all that. And we engineered a foot that would strike the surface to measure the compliance of the surface. We put all sorts of sensors in it.” Sorochan used fLEX in the FIFA research, and several NFL teams now benefit from the technology. He sold the machine earlier this year to SGL System, a Norwegian company that develops grow lights.

Sorochan points out how his team took warm-season Bermuda grass and overseeded it with cool-season ryegrass, allowing the ryegrass to sprout up and act as a stabilizer − similar to how artificial fibers are used in the sod grown on plastic. UT found success using Bermuda grass for the Club World Cup and plans to use it again for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in specific climates, though most soccer pitches are Kentucky Bluegrass. Michigan State University, FIFA and UT will inform teams about the varying playing surfaces throughout the tournament, Sorochan said.

Dillon McCallum, lead technician for the FIFA research, was working for a country club when he showed an interest in turf. His boss pointed him to Sorochan, and McCallum arrived at UT to study for his master's degree in turfgrass pathology. “If I could have told myself sophomore year of college that I was going to be working on a project that was helping assist the organization in putting on the FIFA World Cup, I would have said, 'That's crazy' and 'That sounds perfect,'" he said.

When Sorochan, UT and FIFA install the turf at stadiums, they have a couple of options: the shallow pitch, left, or the slightly elevated one atop six inches of sand shown to the right. There's a layer of a geotextile fabric called Permavoid underneath that manages how water drains from the turf. For the shallow pitch, this layer gives grass the room sand would normally provide. Extra sand will be used for stadiums that require irrigation systems and sprinkler heads to run throughout the field. Turf at Neyland Stadium, for comparison, sits on about one foot of sand, Sorochan said.

Jumping on the turf is fun, sure, but it also illustrates the real reason behind the research − to make the playing surface feel consistent for players no matter where they're playing during the FIFA World Cup. If you were to jump on the different types of turf at UT like I did, you wouldn't be able to tell a difference between them. The consistency is important for player safety, but it also ensures athletes are able to compete at the highest level − and on a level playing field − by minimizing outside factors like torn-up turf. This is why FIFA brought in UT to help with the World Cup and why they plan to keep working together in years to come.

Arthur Blank has just added to his already-impressive sports portfolio after being awarded the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL)'s latest franchise. 

With Boston and Denver being awarded women's soccer franchises in 2023 and 2025, respectively - both of whom will enter the NWSL for their inaugural seasons in 2026 - Atlanta is the latest city to get involved as the sport continues to see growth. 

However, this has come at quite the cost, with Blank's AMB Sports + Entertainment - having to fork out an estimated $165 million record expansion fee to become the 17th team to join the league, and the seventh since 2021. 

AMB Sports + Entertainment is also the holding company of the NFL's Atlanta Falcons and MLS franchise Atlanta United FC, as well as the Mercedes-Benz Stadium, where its new NWSL franchise will play their home games. 

Blank, 83, who made his wealth as a co-founder of Home Depot, also owns the Atlanta Drive Golf Club - a Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy-led advanced tech TGL golf league - and the PGA TOUR Superstore. 

"We have had productive engagement with NWSL and others in its stakeholder group on the possibility of bringing an expansion franchise to Atlanta," a spokesperson for AMB Sports + Entertainment said, per The Athletic. 

"We have nothing to announce currently as those conversations are ongoing."

Although an exact date to join the league is currently unknown, with the final details still yet needing to be ironed out, Atlanta's team is expected to debut sometime after the 2026 NWSL campaign.

This would follow the trend of that of the league's 16th expansion team Denver Summit FC, after they were given the green light to join on January 30, 2025 for a then-record fee worth $110 million. 

This was over double that of 15th expansion team Boston Legacy's joining fee of $53 million - which USC women's basketball star JuJu Watkins has recently invested in - as has provided empirical support for the rate of growth which women's soccer, and women's sports in general, is seeing.

NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman announced in September that the league would shift away from formal bidding processes to a rolling expansion process. 

At the time, per ESPN, she said: "We've made the decision to shift to a rolling process mostly because we've been through this, two rounds, and so, we pretty much know the universe of who's interested. 

"There's more than a dozen of them. Those conversations are ongoing. 

"Each of them has a different perspective on how much time they need to launch, the investments they need to make to be successful, including potentially around infrastructure, and we want to not force a square peg into a round hole."

With huge demand for owning a NWSL franchise, Berman also boldly stated that there is "no reason" why they can't grow the league to 32 teams like that in the NFL. 

She further doubled-down on the league's future growth, announcing that there are plans for a second division to be launched in 2027, like that of the Women's Super League (WSL) and WSL2 at the top of the soccer pyramid across the pond in England.

It appears to be a great time for a market like Atlanta to join the NWSL, with it reportedly being the seventh-largest TV media market in the States, according to Nielsen data. 

The Mercedes-Benz Stadium - the new team's future home - is no stranger to hosting soccer games either, with it also being the home of Atlanta's MLS side, accommodating 42,500 spectators.

The stadium, which also hosts the Falcons, is expandable to accommodate up to 75,000 spectators, though, with it having hosted Super Bowl LIII in 2019, as Tom Brady, Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13-3. 

As it pertains to women's soccer, though, the retractable roof multi-purpose stadium was last in use in 2024 when it hosted the SheBelieves Cup, comprised of the national teams from Brazil, Canada, Japan and the United States. 

The league now houses 17 teams, with further expansion expected in the future

USWNT midfielder and Portland Thorns captain Sam Coffey was asked about the possibility of Atlanta getting a women's NWSL team back in 2024, where she said: “I think it would be a great market for one with Atlanta United here and now with U.S. Soccer starting to plant some roots here.

"I think it would be a great place to bring a team. It's an amazing city... I think it could do really well here."

The U.S. Soccer Federation announced that it was relocating its headquarters and training center to a brand new facility in Georgia back in 2023, with Blank donating $50 million to the project.

Whilst it is still currently under construction, it is expected to be fully completed ahead of the FIFA men's World Cup which takes place across the United States, Canada and Mexico in 2026.

Temperatures in New Jersey, where Chelsea beat Paris St-Germain in the Club World Cup final, reached 38C during the tournament

England defender Reece James is hoping Fifa will consider moving kick-off times for next year's World Cup to help players deal with potentially stifling summer temperatures.  

The United States, Canada and Mexico are co-hosting the tournament, which starts 11 June, but concerns have been raised over the extreme heat conditions teams will likely face. 

James, 25, captained Chelsea to victory in the Club World Cup this summer in the US but the competition faced criticism because of the severe conditions, with the defender's team-mate Enzo Fernandez saying he felt "dizzy" while playing in "very dangerous" heat. 

"It's super difficult conditions to play in that heat, especially us playing in England - there's not anything like that before," said James.

'Heat danger' warning about 2026 World Cup venues

Research led by Queen's University Belfast found the temperatures at 14 of the 16 stadiums being used for the 2026 World Cup could exceed potentially dangerous levels during the tournament. 

Philadelphia, which is one of the US cities hosting matches, was under a severe heat warning during one of Chelsea's training sessions this summer when temperatures reached 37C but because of the 45% humidity conditions felt more like 45C. 

England, who have qualified for the tournament with two games to spare, would benefit from later kick-offs when temperatures have cooled, according to manager Thomas Tuchel.

"For sure, that would definitely help," said James, "later kick-offs when it's not so hot and humid. That would definitely help."

England are planning a warm-weather training camp in Florida to help acclimatise for the tournament and will also build a "heat-proof" game plan, said assistant Anthony Barry. 

Asked if football's world governing body has contacted him for feedback after the Club World Cup, James added: "No, I haven't been asked about my thoughts on kick-off times.

"I'm sure they will have asked someone. Maybe managers or people at the clubs. I'm sure they will have got some feedback."

Fifa is likely to schedule World Cup matches involving major European nations after midnight UK time in an effort to combat heat issues.

It is anticipated these kick-off times will mirror those at the Club World Cup, when the earliest games started at 17:00 BST, followed by 20:00, 23:00 and 02:00.

"You feel the heat the minute you step outside the hotel. The conditions are super hot," James continued. 

"Once you are out there you adapt the longer you are there, when you are settled in once place and try to limit the things you can.

"The pitches when we were there weren't the greatest either and made it a little bit harder but hopefully by the time the World Cup comes around hopefully it's better."

England face Serbia at Wembley Stadium on Thursday and then are away to Albania on Sunday.

Mauricio Pochettino's assistants have been busy racking up some airline miles lately.

Over two weekends in late October and early November, they fanned out across the U.S. to watch a half-dozen World Cup hopefuls perform for their club teams in the MLS Cup playoffs.

Jesus Perez, the top lieutenant for the U.S. men's national team coach, was in Texas for FC Dallas vs. Vancouver Whitecaps and Austin FC vs. LAFC. Miguel D'Agostino saw games in New York and Seattle before wrapping up in Columbus, Ohio. 

And later this month, it'll be off to Europe. D'Agostino, Perez and goalkeeper coach Toni Jimenez will spend the next several months crisscrossing the continent to keep track of the Americans' overseas-based stars.

It's all part of the process of making sure nothing is overlooked, no stone left unturned before May, when Pochettino must name the country's final 26-man roster for the biggest World Cup in history.

The lineup for the Americans' World Cup opener on June 12 in Los Angeles is likely to have familiar names. The midfield duo of Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie. Star forwards Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah up top. 

But the last few decisions won't be easy, as the player pool is significantly deeper than it was even a year ago. Last November, the likes of left-back Max Arfsten, right-back Alex Freeman and goalkeeper Matt Freese didn't have a single cap. Now, all of three are projected to comfortably make the World Cup cut and, in Freese's case, be a starter when the curtain goes up on the biggest stage in sports next summer.

"Not being arrogant, I think we are a coaching staff that has the capacity to improve players," Pochettino told me this week. "Not only young players who are between 18 and 21, but even someone like [38-year-old U.S. captain] Tim Ream. 

"Because you can always improve. I think that is our talent: we like to — and we are able to — make players better."

Pochettino's track record speaks for itself. 

During a 16-year coaching career that included stints managing some of the world's biggest clubs, Pochettino earned a reputation for development. He fielded more than 50 academy graduates during spells at Espanyol, Southampton, Tottenham, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea.

Seventeen players that he managed at club level debuted for England's national team. His 2017-18 Tottenham side had nine representatives reach at least the semis of the 2018 World Cup, more than any other team. The last two World Cup-winning captains (Hugo Lloris and Lionel Messi) and the leading scorer at both events (Harry Kane and Kylian Mbappe) worked under Pochettino at the time.

But helping players reach new heights as an international boss is significantly more challenging.

"We spent every single day with guys at the clubs we worked at," Pochettino told me. "Here, it's about how you have influence in a very short period. At some point, we have to help them in an emotional way. The important thing is to connect them with their talent, for them to feel free, and when they arrive in the national team it's an environment where they're going to be happy."

Pochettino hasn't been able to spend more than a few days at a time on the training field with European-based standouts like Pulisic and McKennie. Injuries to other regulars, including Adams, striker Ricardo Pepi – along with full-back duo Sergino Dest and Antonee "Jedi" Robinson – have further reduced those opportunities.

Their absences also opened the door for others.

Take Freeman. The son of Super Bowl winner Antonio Freeman wasn't even invited to January camp. But then the 21-year-old strung together a number of fine performances in his first season as a starter for Orlando City. He earned a look and took his chance, logging every minute of the Gold Cup. He also went the full 90 minutes in the USMNT's 2-1 win over Australia last month. 

"Everything could be different if Sergiño arrived in a better condition in June, and we don't send him back [home]," Perez told me. "If Sergiño was there, maybe Alex Freeman doesn't play. This is a world of opportunities. But you need to be ready."

Freeman didn't land on Pochettino's radar by accident. He and his assistants visited more than 50 clubs during their first year at the helm. They leaned on people like former U.S. assistants B.J. Callaghan and Nico Estévez, now the head coaches with MLS teams Nashville SC and Austin FC, respectively, who knew intimately both the domestic league and USMNT pool. 

Every time Pochettino or his assistants spoke to a coach or sporting director, they wanted to know the same thing: Which players in your group do you think can reach the next level?

"If we go back 13 months," Perez told me, "That question helped some guys to be in the national team today."

Discussions with officials at top European clubs are just as important. Possibly more, such as the case with Pulisic.

"I remember one conversation in Milan," Perez told me. "The [AC Milan] coach at that time said to me, ‘I feel Christian shines if he's in this space, doing this role.' For me, it was important to translate to Mauricio. 

"I'm not saying we take 100 percent of what they say," Perez added. "But these guys are professionals like us. It's super valuable that our colleagues give us their opinion. Then we consider it and evaluate it. I think in soccer, like in life, you have to be humble enough to listen to everyone and then make your own choices."

When a player is given a chance, he must perform to keep his place.

"We identified in these guys that there was the potential to improve," Pochettino told me in reference to Arfsten, Freeman, Freese and others. "When you compare players that were in the last World Cup to Freeman or Max, who started to play with us less than one year ago, now they match the quality of the players in Europe. That is evident. It's obvious that they're now at the same level."

Freese might be the best example. The Harvard graduate didn't appear in the January wins over Venezuela and Costa Rica. But he won the Gold Cup job over 2022 World Cup starter Matt Turner and has now been in the lineup for 10 consecutive matches. In just a few months, he progressed from international novice to Pochettino's clear No. 1 keeper. 

"It allows me to kind of play like myself," Freese said during availability on Monday when asked how much the confidence shown by Jimenez and Pochettino has helped his game. "I consistently just want to repay that trust."

With Jedi sidelined indefinitely with his knee injury, Arfsten is all but certain to add to the 14 U.S. caps he's already won in 2025. 

"I do think I've improved this year, just in all aspects of the game," Arfsten said in a group on Tuesday. "Being involved in these camps and having our coaching staff here express belief in me, and give me advice on certain things, has definitely helped me become more confident. I think it's helped me grow as a player a lot."

Room for more growth remains. Plenty of work does, too. The USMNT won't gather for another four months when the year's final camp breaks on Nov. 20. When they convene again in late March, the World Cup will be just around the corner.

"That is a massive challenge for us," Pochettino told me. "But after one year, we know all the players. And they have started to understand what we want. So we're very excited, and we're convinced that we are going to arrive at the World Cup in a very good place."

Ben Shelton may not have hoped for the start he's had at the Nitto ATP Finals, but his perspective remains as sharp as his serve.

After a narrow three-set defeat to Felix Auger-Aliassime on Wednesday, the 23-year-old American slipped to 0-2 on his debut appearance at the season finale in Turin. Yet even in disappointment, Shelton's optimism and competitiveness shone through.

In a gripping contest defined by bold play and razor-thin margins, Shelton's fearless shotmaking was momentarily tested at 2/4 in the second-set tie-break, when he took a tumble and was left grimacing and limping between points for the remainder of the set.

“I think it should be okay. It was just one of those where it hit really hard on the ground,” Shelton said of his left knee. “It hurt really bad for the next 10, 15 minutes. I wasn't about to stop and call the trainer, then come back and try to serve down a mini-break and stay in the set. I just kept going, maybe [due to] adrenaline. But I didn't feel it at all through the whole third set.”

The fall came at a crucial moment, but Shelton's desire to carry on epitomised his fighting spirit, one that has become a defining trait throughout his 2025 campaign.

The American won his biggest career title at the ATP Masters 1000 in Toronto and reached a career-high No. 5 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Though he has also been tested with adversity, having been forced to retire from the US Open third round due to a shoulder injury.

“If I rated it 1 to 10, maybe an 8 out of 10,” Shelton said when asked to rate his 2025 season. “I made huge improvements and strides from the year before. What I've done post US Open, I haven't been happy with. But the rhythm that I found in the first three quarters of the year was really good.

“I'm a guy that gets into a really good rhythm when I'm playing a lot of matches. I had a lot of clarity this summer on how to play: shot tolerance, what shots to play at certain times. I had a lot of clarity on what my identity was on the court, how I was going to win, my winning formula. I'm still searching for that a little bit right now."

Upon returning from his injury in Shanghai in October, Shelton has struggled to post the results he was able to before. He notched a 3-3 record between then and arriving in Turin, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

“These last four tournaments of the year - Shanghai, Basel, Paris, here - have been more difficult for me trying to find that 'wow' feeling,” said Shelton. “All the guys that I have played have been in form and playing great tennis, competing well. [There are] certain things that feel very off at this point of the year. It can't be happening.

“For me this week, it's been my forehand, which usually is a money shot for me, money-maker. The first ball after the serve, things that have been a little off that make it disappointing, [but] a lot of things to be happy about this season.”



This week in Turin, Shelton has deployed an aggressive serve-and-volley approach, which was particularly evident against Auger-Aliassime. At 5-5 in the second set, Shelton escaped a nervy Deuce game with consecutive volley winners, which both came from second serves.

“I think it's something that I've always done since I was young [hitting big second serves],” Shelton said when asked of his high second-serve speeds. “I used to hit a lot more double faults and actually be more aggressive on my second serve because I wanted to get a free point on the first serve and second serve.

“That's always been my mentality, a more aggressive mentality. Whenever I'm serving, whether it is first or second, to have an advantage. I think that's the mindset for some guys and it isn't for others. I think if you look at the guys in the Top 10 right now, a lot of guys who go after the second serve have fast second serves that are difficult to deal with.”

After defeats to Alexander Zverev and Auger-Aliassime in Turin this week, Shelton is 0-2 in the Bjorn Borg Group, leaving just a small chance of him qualifying for the semi-finals. Despite this, he is able to draw lessons from the experience and admits that it usually takes him a few appearances to find his feet at tournaments.

“I'm just excited to be here, the opportunity,” said Shelton. “[It's] not the best week for me so far. Obviously that is frustrating and disappointing, being as big of a tournament as it is. Historically I haven't been the person who's come to a new place, a new tournament, and just been outstanding right away. I think there's a bit of a learning curve everywhere you go.

“For me it's just back to work regardless of how things end here, [to] be proud about the season that I had and the things that I accomplished. Let the things sting that I wasn't able to accomplish and that I fell short on. It will just motivate me for next year.”

Felix Auger-Aliassime showcased his trademark indoor brilliance and mental fortitude on Wednesday at the Nitto ATP Finals, where he got up and running with a thrilling comeback win over Ben Shelton.

The 25-year-old came within two points of defeat in a tense second-set tie-break, but he rallied with grit to seal a 4-6, 7-6(7), 7-5 victory after two hours, 25 minutes in Turin. Although Shelton's relentless serve-and-volley pressure posed constant challenges, Auger-Aliassime stayed composed to notch his Tour-leading 20th deciding-set win of the season.

“He was playing much better than me at the start,” Auger-Aliassime said. “It's not often that I get broken twice in the first set indoors… It was a weird start, but as the match went on I was finding ways to put returns in the court. Once we engaged in the rallies, I felt like I could win more. You just have to fight, believe, and play the next point the right way.”

With the victory, Auger-Aliassime keeps intact his hopes of reaching the semi-finals at the prestigious season finale for the first time. Having fallen to defending champion Jannik Sinner in his opener, he now sits at 1-1 in the Bjorn Borg Group and will face third seed Alexander Zverev in his final round-robin match on Friday.

There were concerns over Auger-Aliassime's physical state after he suffered an injury scare during his defeat to Sinner, but he silenced those doubts as he moved freely against Shelton. It was in fact the American who took a tumble in the second-set tie-break, in which he threw in a costly double fault on set point to offer Auger-Aliassime a route back in.

“I felt great, physically. We recovered well, did the right things,” said Auger-Aliassime. “Today I was able to play two-and-a-half hours of high-intensity tennis. I have to give him credit, he kept coming up with great serves. When the opponent plays that well, you have to give him credit, but also to myself for staying cool.”

Auger-Aliassime, the No. 8 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, has been a proven threat on indoor hard courts over the years, tallying a record 84 wins in these conditions this decade, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Once he levelled the score against Shelton, he found his groove on serve and ultimately found a way through to improving to 2-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

Shelton will be left to rue missed opportunities as he slips to 0-2 in the Bjorn Borg Group on his debut at the season finale. He lost five consecutive points from 6/3 in the second-set tie-break against Zverev in his first match and hit a series of crucial unforced errors at a similar moment against Auger-Aliassime.

Osaka joined a chorus of praise from fellow players towards Townsend during this year's US Open when the American was subject to a verbal tirade from Jelena Ostapenko following their second-round match—Ostapenko declaring Townsend had “no class” and “no education.”“I know Taylor and I know how hard she's worked and I know how smart she is,” Osaka said in a post-match press conference that week, “so she's the furthest thing from uneducated or anything like that.”Townsend went on to finish runner-up in the US Open women's doubles event and qualify for her first WTA Finals, partnering world No. 1 Katerina Siniakova to go undefeated in round-robin play before falling in the finals to No. 2 seeds Gabriela Dabrowski and Erin Routliffe.“I really feel like the type of tennis that I played and just the way that the person and the player that I am now really gained a lot of respect in the locker room amongst my counterparts,” Townsend said of her season in New York.“Even Novak [Djokovic] said something to me. Jannik [Sinner] said something to me. Like, ‘Hey, like, you played really well, keep going, keep going.' Everyone was watching. Even sometimes when you think, oh, nobody is, like, whatever, but they're watching. For them to actually go out of their way to comment something to me, it means everything.”

All of that makes for a well-deserved off-season for Townsend and Osaka, who reached the semifinals of women's singles at the US Open and earned her first Top 20 finish since becoming a mom in 2023.“Honestly, it's kind of inspiring for me, because it makes me just want to train and try to get better, and hopefully, yeah, just give it my very best shot again and see what happens,” Osaka said after her semifinal defeat to Amanda Anisimova.In the meantime, the sport's latest dynamic duo will refresh, recharge and, in the words of 4 Non Blondes frontwoman Linda Perry, “pray for a revolution” in 2026.

Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski continued to underline their intent at the Nitto ATP Finals on Wednesday, when they secured another clinical victory to move to the brink of semi-final qualification.

The British duo delivered a gritty performance to defeat second seeds Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten 7-6(7), 3-6, 10-7 after one hour, 43 minutes in their second round-robin clash. Salisbury required a medical timeout during the first set but — with strong support of Skupski — maintained his sharp reactions late in the Match Tie-break to extend his winning streak at the prestigious season finale to 12 matches, having won consecutive titles with Rajeev Ram in 2022-23.

“I wasn't feeling my best out there, I think I had a bug overnight, but Neal was great,” said Salisbury. “I didn't have as much energy as normal, but I knew Neal was there to support me. He played great and did most of the work. I'm not sure how we got through that one in the end.”

With their victory, Salisbury and Skupski improved to 2-0 in the John McEnroe Group. They can qualify for the semi-finals later on Wednesday if Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic defeat Christian Harrison and Evan King.

The decisive moment of the match came at 7/7 in the Match Tie-break, when Salisbury guided a forehand return winner past Patten to clip the outer edge of the line. It was one of three consecutive points to win the match and level their Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Heliovaara/Patten at 2-2.

“It was a very good level throughout, there were fine margins,” Skupski said. “We know as a team that we've fought hard all year, and when it comes to tie-breaks, we just fight until the end. We've had crucial matches throughout the year and that's helped us along the way.”

Salisbury and Skupski are making their team debut at the Nitto ATP Finals following a rock-solid 2025 season, during which they reached five finals, including at Roland Garros and the US Open. They now boast a 57-26 record on the year, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, and will face Harrison and King in their final group-stage clash on Friday.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's weekend to forget in Sao Paulo

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Every Max Verstappen overtake

Ahead of a wave of new technical regulations being introduced in 2026, Red Bull and Racing Bulls will hold a joint launch event alongside Ford.

Red Bull and Racing Bulls have announced a joint season launch alongside Ford ahead of the 2026 campaign.

At the United States home of Ford in Detroit, Michigan, on January 15, the two teams will unveil their respective liveries for the next generation of cars, a season in which Red Bull Ford Powertrains will debut as both squads' power unit manufacturer.

Red Bull have chosen Detroit to pay homage to Ford's heritage ahead of the partnership's maiden season together.

Laurent Mekies, CEO and Team Principal of Red Bull Racing, said: "The launch of the Red Bull Ford Powertrains era represents not only a bold step into the future, but a powerful expression of what's possible when world-class engineering, innovation, and passion come together.

“To see the energy, precision, and scale behind this project is inspiring. It's the culmination of several years of collaboration between two great names in motorsport. We're incredibly excited to begin this new chapter, driven by the same determination and excellence that defines both Ford and Red Bull."

Jim Farley, President and CEO of Ford Motor Company, added: "Since we announced our return to F1 with Red Bull, the Ford team have been working night and day to get ready for 2026. But this is about so much more than just the racing.

“It is about how we use our learnings from F1 to make our cars and trucks better for our customers. What we will learn together with Red Bull will define the technologies of the future and that is what excites me most about this relationship."

Peter Bayer, CEO of Racing Bulls, said: "We're incredibly excited to welcome Ford back into the world of Formula 1. With over 125 years of heritage, innovation, and absolute dedication to performance, Ford embodies the same competitive spirit that drives our team.

“This partnership brings together global brands united by a love of racing and a commitment to pushing boundaries.

“As a member of the Red Bull family and together with our title partners, Visa and Cash App, we see huge opportunities to join forces and connect with a new generation of fans and showcase the future of performance and mobility on a global stage. Launching this new era in Detroit, the birthplace of Ford, makes it all the more special."

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's weekend to forget in Sao Paulo

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Every Max Verstappen overtake

Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto reflect on the different challenges they faced in the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.

Pierre Gasly managed to score in both the Sprint and Grand Prix in Sao Paulo where he finished P10, as his strong run of form in Brazil continued. It was a much-needed confidence boost for Alpine as well, who had not scored since before the summer break.

Gasly started 13th for the Sprint but managed to fight forward to finish eighth, and his performance in the Grand Prix was just an impressive despite a top-10 starting berth.

He was forced to pit early after opting for the soft tyres off the line, and had to work hard to get back through plenty of traffic and climb back into the top 10.

With two cars one-stopping and creating a DRS train, Gasly finished just three tenths of a second ahead of Alex Albon for a very hard-fought point. While his tally of two points for the weekend did not have an affect on the Championship, with Alpine still rooted to the bottom of the table, it was a good boost for a team that have been up against it this season.

And for the Frenchman, it was just reward for two strong drivers – the sort he has put in without recognition at the back of the field weekend in, weekend out.

“I'm very, very happy. We hadn't scored a point on a Sunday since Spa before the summer break, so it has been a long three months, and this weekend, we just had a good car,” Gasly explained.

“We managed to score one point in the Sprint and another point on Sunday, which was pretty difficult, so I'm pleased.”

He then elaborated on the midfield battle, with the Frenchman getting to fight with Isack Hadjar more than once – something he was happy with, despite his fellow Frenchman eventually finishing ahead.

“It was a tough battle with Isack. I managed to dive twice into Turn 1. Unfortunately, he was getting me back every time on the straight before Turn 4, so I spent quite a lot of time thinking I'm going to have nightmares about that VCARB rear wing!

“But I think overall, they were fighting for – they got a podium this year? – they have been pretty strong this year, and just to be in that mix showed we had a good car this weekend.”

Gasly scored his maiden podium at Interlagos in his Toro Rosso days, and finished on the rostrum last season for Alpine – despite the team once again having a relatively uncompetitive car. While the track has been a happy hunting ground for Gasly, this year's result he credited to the car.

“For sure, Brazil is treating me well, but the car was just on another level compared to the last three months. So, we've just got to understand exactly why and from now, enjoy the good weekends. Hopefully we can repeat that again.”

As for Franco Colapinto, the Argentine racer had a very up and down weekend after the announcement that he was staying at Alpine for 2026. A heavy crash in the Sprint was the low point, but his fate in the race was largely out of his control after he was hit from behind at the start by Lewis Hamilton.

Colapinto did not blame the Ferrari man for a tricky race where he finished 15th, but saw the moment where he spun off in the Sprint as the turning point.

“I think definitely after the Sprint race, we were on the back foot a bit and just struggled as a team on my car, on my side of the garage. I struggled more as I kind of lost the pace that I had on Friday. It was easier to fix the little things on Friday, and we were in a good position already in the Sprint, then everything became a little bit more difficult.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's weekend to forget in Sao Paulo

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Every Max Verstappen overtake

Yuki Tsunoda conceded that "nothing worked" as he suffered "one of the worst weekends" for Red Bull at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.

Yuki Tsuonda was left scratching his head after what he called “one of the worst weekends” in Brazil.

Red Bull endured a difficult time in Brazil, with Max Verstappen's drive from pit lane to podium on Sunday adding some much-needed gloss.

For Tsunoda, however, there was no such reprieve, as early contact with Lance Stroll earned him a 10-second penalty, while he then earned a second sanction for failing to serve the penalty correctly, before crossing the line last of the classified finishers in P17.

“It's just a shame,” reflected Tsunoda. “Literally, nothing worked this weekend. When something works, something didn't work at the same time.

“One of the worst weekends. I don't know why. We just struggled with the grip overall, and that's it.”

Of the contact that had sent Stroll into a spin, Tsunoda added: “I don't know. It's a shame about the contact. I didn't notice that I even had contact, so I'm sorry for him. That's it.”

Tsunoda is believed to be fighting for his Red Bull future, with Racing Bulls driver Isack Hadjar rumoured to be in the frame for a promotion.

While attempting to take what positives he could from Tsunoda's performance, Red Bull Team Principal Laurent Mekies agreed with his driver's assessment of the weekend.

“Of course, it's a bit unfortunate,” he said. “He lost a lot of time in that contact, got the extra 10 seconds penalty, then we made a mistake on our side, we got another 10 seconds extra penalty.

“So, it's a shame, it doesn't seem to be going our way. His last stint in clean air is strong. You can do it yourself, if you take the race plot and remove these 2 x 10 seconds, you actually end up in a decent fight for points.

“But again, it's the same thing, would and should don't win races, so we can only pocket the last strong stint in clean air that he has done.”

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Scary Movie 6 has added Damon Wayans Jr. (New Girl), Kim Wayans (In Living Color), and Heidi Gardner to its cast, setting two franchise vets to return: Gardner's fellow SNL alum Cheri Oteri and Chris Elliott.


	Character details for the newcomers to the Miramax horror spoof franchise are under wraps. It's unclear whether Oteri and Elliott will reprise past roles or take on new ones — given the nature of these films, anything is possible. Oteri previously appeared in the first Scary Movie in 2000 as Gail Halstorm, a sensationalist television reporter parodying Courteney Cox's Scream character Gale Weathers. Elliott is remembered for playing Hanson, the creepy haunted mansion caretaker from 2001's Scary Movie 2, though he also appeared in 2006's Scary Movie 4 as a different character — Ezekiel, a village loon.

Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, and Keenen Ivory Wayans, the architects of the franchise, returned to write the script alongside longtime collaborator Rick Alvarez, who is also producing. Michael Tiddes is directing the project.

	Other newcomers in the cast include Olivia Rose Keegan, Savannah Lee Nassif, Cameron Scott Roberts, Sydney Park, Gregg Wayans, Ruby Snowber, and Benny Zielke. Miramax is producing, with Jonathan Glickman, Alexandra Loewy, and Thom Zadra as executive producers. Paramount will release the film worldwide, as part of its first-look deal with Miramax, on June 12, 2026.


	Damon Wayans Jr. is repped by UTA, Ziffren Brittenham, and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole; Kim Wayans by KFM Management; Gardner by CAA, OPE Partners, and Hansen Jacobson; Oteri by Brave Artists Management and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman; and Elliott by UTA and Vault Entertainment.

Amid the thicket of awards season, it's sometimes nice to pause and smell the nonfiction roses. Documentary film festival DOC NYC is America's largest showcase of documentary films and this month comes to New York City from November 12-20, with another week of online screenings through November 30. (Take a look at the organization's DOC NYC Shortlist of the best documentaries of the year, many of which are returning to theaters for the event.)

IFC Center, SVA Theatre, and Village East by Angelika will host screenings of more than 200 films and events, including 30 world premieres as well as many revivals of the year's best in nonfiction filmmaking so far.

The festival opens on November 12 (that's tonight) at the SVA Theatre with the U.S. premiere of Christopher Nelius's “Whistle,” which whimsically looks behind the curtain of the Masters of Musical Whistling festival, where the world's top whistlers gather to connect. Closing out the festival on November 20, also at the SVA Theatre, will be the NYC premiere of Ivy Meerpol's “Ask E. Jean,” an explosive look at writer and cultural icon E. Jean Carroll and her lawsuits against Donald Trump when he accused her of lying about charges of sexual assault she put against him.

 










Below, IndieWire rounds up 10 more films worth seeing.

From the “Sing Sing” team of Oscar-nominated executive producer Clarence Maclin and JJ Velazquez, who was exonerated last year after more than two decades behind bars, “Beyond” takes a documentary look inside the walls of the historic upstate New York prison — and the incarcerated men who live there and tell its stories. Directed by Asia Johnson (herself previously incarcerated) and Michael Kleiman, the film follows a group of incarcerated men as they prepare for a TED-style public speaking symposium. The event is designed to allow men to explore their humanity and narratives in ways that transcend their circumstances, in front of an audience of policymakers, prison officials, and their loved ones.

A world premiere earlier this year at CPH:DOX, Norwegian photographer-turned-filmmaker Monica Strømdahl brings a decidedly European lens to an American story: Of a family living in a rundown motel known as a flophouse. In the process, “Flophouse America” puts a telescopic lens on the overall housing crisis in the U.S., focused on 12-year-old Mikal, who lives in a constricted, inexpensive room with his hard-drinking parents and beloved cat, Smokey. This intimate documentary also doubles as a coming-of-age film, as Strømdahl tracked Mikal for more than three years, from childhood to young adulthood, and in often harrowing proximity to his parents.

 










Filmmaker Karla Murthy's immigrant portrait has been picking up buzz at other American festivals but makes its New York City premiere at DOC NYC. In “The Gas Station Attendant,” the South Asian-descended director reflects on her father's life, when he ran away from home to leave the poverty of his Indian village. His life changed after meeting a Texan couple, received a sponsored visa, and arrived in the United States — but the American dream, for H.N. Shantha Murthy, was not easily won. The film weaves home videos, phone conversations, and more to create an intimate love letter addressed to the immigrant working class.

Celia Aniskovich goes behind the curtain of a singular New York City holiday tradition: The Christmas tree trade, in which merchants set up shop across the five boroughs to sell firs on sidewalks. “The Merchants of Joy” follows five families hustling every winter to maintain the beloved tradition, and in a market rife with competition over tree sources as well as locations. New York City's own seasonal stand workers add texture to a documentary that tries to parse how the proceeds from just five weeks circa the holidays can make for a sustainable yearlong living.

“Do women make harsher films, and what does harsh even mean?” That's the question on filmmaker Isa Willinger's (“Plastic Fantastic”) mind with the cinematic ode “No Mercy.” The documentary features talking heads Céline Sciamma, Virginie Despentes, Nina Menkes, Catherine Breillat, Apolline Traoré, Joey Soloway, and Ana Lily Amirpour to examine how women (and more presently nonbinary filmmakers) have told stories onscreen since the 1960s. “No Mercy” also interweaves clips from nearly 50 films ranging the narrative to the experimental as filmmakers, and Willinger, reflect on their careers and how they've depicted violence, trauma, and power throughout their careers.

 










Filmmakers Jennifer Ash Rudick and Amanda Benchley chart four decades in “The Life and Time of Marilyn Minter,” a feminist provocateur who has been pushing against contemporary art's borders for almost five decades. The film interweaves rare footage, studio archival materials, and more glimpses into her artistic practice to trace her arc as a rising New York art star who was not without controversy for her brazenly sexual work. Jane Fonda, Naomi Fry, Jeff Koons, Monica Lewinsky, Padma Lakshmi, Lizzo, Laurie Simmons, and more among the celebrities who make an appearance in this fast-paced and entertaining documentary.

Pulled from Sundance due to significant developments in the story before ultimately premiering at Cannes, Eugene Jarecki's Julian Assange portrait “The Six Billion Dollar Man” arrives at DOC NYC this week. The “Why We Fight” and “The House I Live In” documentary filmmaker turns the story of the WikiLeaks founder into a tense inquiry into truth, power, and freedom of the press. The film features never-before-seen footage and unprecedented access to Assange — including CCTV footage from his time in confinement.

Filmmaker/actor Jeremy Xido returns to his home city of Detroit to untangle his complicated backstory as the white son of revolutionaries who then became “adopted” by an African American family in a mostly Black neighborhood. “Sons of Detroit” also charts a city shifting from its golden years as the epicenter of the automobile industry, circa Motor City and Motown days, to a city rattled by racism and violence and depleted industry. But it's also a love letter to the city, beginning in the 1970s through the present day, wherein Xido turns the camera back on himself to reconnect with an estranged chosen family member to examine what pulled them apart.

 










Zackary Canepari and Jessica Dimmock's gun violence documentary premieres at DOC NYC before heading to HBO later in November. Specifically, Canepari and Dimmock tackle the subject through the lens of school shootings and the increasing curricular preparation for them. They speak to teachers training with firearms who lead simulations of active shooter situations as well as students for whom preparing for a shooting is just part of the morning routine. Ultimately, the film takes a bird's eye view of a multi-billion-dollar industry that markets school safety with innovations like bulletproof desks. Anything but actual, tangible gun reform.

A decorated hit across multiple regional documentary festivals, Ian Bell chronicles the 1999 protest of the World Trade Organization, where 40,000 protests rallied against globalization beginning in Seattle and shared concerns about WTO's environmental and labor impacts. Anarchists, environmentalists, labor unions, and even religious organizations and more came together hoping to turn minds against support of the WTO, which was founded in 1995. The protest lasted from November 30 to December 3, and this film builds off 1,000 hours of archival footage to form an immersive look at a moment in time: a moment when environmental collapse and the end of the middle class were top-of-mind fears. Sound familiar?

This week, on the glittering 20th anniversary celebration episode of Dancing with the Stars (DWTS), seasoned pro Witney Carson and wildlife-champion-turned-ballroom-competitor Robert Irwin lit up the dance floor with a birthday-party themed routine that perfectly married flair, emotion and showmanship. As the show marked two decades of sequins and mirrorballs, Carson and Irwin brought a fresh, fun and heartfelt energy—proving that even in the spotlight of a milestone episode, they managed to keep the rhythm authentic and their partnership compelling.

Irwin broke down in tears multiple times immediately after his performance. The couple received tens from all four judges to create a perfect score of 40 out of 40.

Irwin also partnered up with Xochitl Gomez as a part of last night's anniversary episode.

For the show's landmark 20th-birthday episode, DWTS pulled out all the stops—returning pros, a relay round twist, and routines steeped in nostalgia. With stakes high and celebration in the air, Carson admitted to The Hollywood Reporter that this was a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to dance with Robert on such a pivotal episode.

Their performance opened with vibrant party vibes—balloons, flash lighting, and a nod to the show's past, with Carson guiding Irwin through the chart-topping medley of moves. She emphasized how the milestone context gave them a chance to stretch creatively. Meanwhile, Irwin embraced the moment with characteristic positivity, making it clear that for him this dance was more than competition: it was tribute. As a wildlife advocate whose family has long championed conservation, competing amid this celebratory atmosphere added emotional layers.

Witney Carson, now well-established on DWTS, is guided by experience; Robert Irwin, though less polished as a dancer, brings raw energy and authenticity. According to their interview, their dynamic relies on trust and playfulness—Carson guiding, Irwin soaking it in. For their birthday-night routine, Carson let Irwin's personality shine: bits of theatrical flair, a moment of surprise, and a wink to his conservation roots.

Beyond the ballroom, Robert Irwin and Witney Carson shared a charming off-stage moment that captured hearts. At his home base, the Australia Zoo, Irwin introduced a newborn wallaby named “Witney the Wallaby,” in honor of Carson. He presented the gift during a surprise reveal People reports, calling out the “uncanny” resemblance between the wallaby's energetic hops and Carson's dynamic presence. That sweet gesture echoed the spirit of their performance: grounded, genuine, and joyfully unexpected.

Carson's reaction—genuine surprise and delight—added a humanizing moment amid the glitz of DWTS. For Irwin, the move highlighted that his appearance on the show is part of a broader mission: leveraging his platform for wildlife awareness and meaningful connections. For Carson, it reinforced her role beyond choreography—the mentor, the collaborator, the one who helps the story shine. Together in this episode they proved that celebrations, when done with heart, can transcend spectacle.

Vacuuming doesn't have to suck.

If your home is in need of a deep clean ahead of the holidays, why not try the fancy mop-vac combo that Martha Stewart swears by?

Last year, the lifestyle magnate and self-proclaimed “clean fanatic” raved about the Bissell CrossWave OmniForce in an unsponsored Instagram post, and the nifty gadget happens to be on sale ahead of Black Friday at Amazon.

“Rather than sweeping (which raises dust), rather than vacuuming and then mopping, this machine does it all!!!” Stewart raved in her caption, mentioning how her four dogs and many daily visitors are no match for this lean cleaning machine.

Made to replace your mops and work on both dry and wet spills, the CrossWave OmniForce also sanitizes — killing 99.9% of bacteria on sealed hard floors, according to the brand — and has a convenient tangle-free brush roller.

Bissell's Pet Hair Erasers and hand vacs are also bestsellers, but we are ready to toss our dirty mops and dusty vacs for this modern innovation.

For those looking to spend under $200, the popular CrossWave Edge and CrossWave Pet Pro is also included in Amazon's early Black Friday deals. (The latter's better for homes with pets, like Stewart's.)

One of the features Stewart likes best is how quickly these all-in-one vac-mops work — and who is not in favor of spending less time cleaning? (And more time lounging.)

Over 17,000 Amazon shoppers have given the CrossWave Pet Pro five-star ratings, and we're ready to make room for it in our pantry as well. No word on how long the deal will last, so don't delay!

The K-pop girl group had attempted to break away from the label after the firing of mentor Min Hee-jin.

	After losing their legal battle against ADOR, the members of NewJeans have decided to resume activities with the label.


	On Wednesday (Nov. 12), ADOR announced that K-pop stars Haerin and Hyein had agreed to continue working with the HYBE subsidiary after “thoughtful consideration with their respective families and thorough discussions” about how to move forward.


	“The two members have decided to respect the court's latest ruling and adhere to their exclusive contract with the label,” the company wrote in a statement shared with Billboard. “ADOR is committed to providing its full support to HAERIN and HYEIN to ensure the seamless continuation of their artistic endeavors.” 

	











	“We request the warm support from the fans and respectfully urge you to avoid engaging in unfounded speculation regarding the members,” ADOR added.


	Other outlets are reporting that the remaining members, Minji, Hanni and Danielle, have also agreed to continue working with the label. Billboard has reached out to HYBE for comment.


	News of NewJeans' return comes a year after the members first announced plans to leave ADOR and release music independently, alleging that the label had violated their contract by firing their mentor, former CEO Min Hee-jin. This past October, a Korean judge sided with ADOR's stance that the termination of Min was not sufficient grounds to void the band's contract, upholding that NewJeans may not pursue any independent activities until 2029.


	“We sincerely hope that today's judgment, which comes after long-term verification of various claims and facts and reaffirms prior rulings, will serve as an opportunity for the artists to calmly reflect on this matter,” ADOR said in a statement following its victory. “As we stated during the trial, we have completed preparations for the artist's activities, including the release of a studio album, and are waiting. We will do our utmost to return to the fans through discussions with the artist.”

	











	Since forming in 2022, NewJeans has released a number of singles and two EPs, including 2nd EP ‘Get Up', which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. The group has also charted five songs on the Billboard Hot 100.


	In 2025, Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein began releasing music and performing under the name “NJZ.” They were ordered to stop doing so after ADOR filed a preliminary injunction, and in June, they were each fined $734,000 for “unauthorized activities.”

The most interesting thing about the sanitized, fully authorized celebrity biodocs that have been mass-produced during the streaming era — sometimes the only interesting thing about the sanitized, fully authorized celebrity biodocs that have been mass-produced during the streaming era — is that they offer an unusually clear glimpse at how the famous like to think of themselves. 

Often just candid enough to be described as “refreshingly honest” (as Netflix's editorial site declares the company's own portrait of Sylvester Stallone), these feature-length exercises in reputation laundering don't give us a peek behind the curtain so much as they invite their stars to remap their private lives onto a stage that gives them full control of the spotlight. If you don't want people to know who you really are, one of the smartest things you can do these days is to star in a slickly produced documentary about yourself so that people feel like you've already told them.

On that score, Angus Wall's super watchable “Being Eddie” is among the more convincing films of its kind, because instead — or by way — of trying to show us who the real Eddie Murphy is, it commits itself to arguing that Murphy has always known. Indeed, the doc goes so far as to suggest that Murphy's acute self-knowledge is his single most defining trait; that he's only become somewhat inscrutable to us over the years because our perception of him has fluctuated so much more than his perception of himself. He's changed a bit along the way, of course (to the point that he now sees the young stand-up comic on stage in “Raw” as a completely different person), but the highs didn't break him, and the lows didn't either. As “Trading Places” director John Landis puts it in one of this film's uncommonly insightful talking head interviews: “Eddie has solid middle-class values, and he's too vain to destroy himself.”  

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Murphy agrees with that assessment. “My biggest blessing is that I love myself, and that I knew what I wanted to do really, really early,” he says while leaning back into one of the ~412 different couches that line the sprawling Los Angeles mansion he shares with his (briefly glimpsed) wife Paige Butcher, and “Being Eddie” backs him up on both points. Determined to become the next Richard Pryor by the time he was 10 years old (“I wanted to be funny like Richard and cool like Elvis”), Murphy was so locked into his mission from such a young age that he became one of the '80s biggest stars without snorting even a single line of coke — in stark contrast to his hero, who was forced to drop out of “Trading Places” after he set himself on fire amid a rum-soaked freebasing session. 

He doesn't drink. He had his first joint at 30. He is never the life of the party, despite allegedly liking to party all the time. All of the arcade cabinets in his game room work perfectly, unlike Jamie Foxx's spray-happy bathroom sink, which he leaves broken in order to allow some funniness to seep into his otherwise enchanted life. Murphy's favorite thing to do is to binge watch “Ridiculousness” at home (he compares the MTV franchise to the films of Alejandro Jodorowsky), and when the doc inevitably reaches the part about how the disaster reception to “Norbit” cost him the Oscar for “Dreamgirls,” he insists that he was only mad because the Academy made him leave the house for nothing. Murphy describes himself as “a simple guy,” while good friend Dave Chappelle prefers to think of him as “unscathed.” 

 










Unscathed maybe, but not invulnerable. On the contrary, Murphy proudly identifies as an extremely sensitive type, insisting that sensitivity — as opposed to sheer talent — has been the biggest reason for his success as an artist. That sensitivity has cut both ways. As an upstart comedian it allowed him to be ahead of the culture; to see Hollywood's blind spots as clearly as Axel Foley could spot a shotgun at a strip club, and to recognize how a brash young Black kid could turn the entire country on its head by staring its true complexion straight in the face. As a 34-year-old icon whose “Vampire in Brooklyn” inspired David Spade to make a single joke at his expense during “Weekend Update” (“Look children, it's a falling star”), Murphy's sensitivity caused him to turn his back on “SNL” for almost 25 years. 

So eager to display its access that the documentary's opening shot pilots a drone right through the retractable roof of Murphy's estate, and even more eager not to lose it, “Being Eddie” lets its namesake set the terms for his own successes and failures. Murphy is justifiably proud of himself for belonging to “the first generation of Black overachievers,” and he never hesitates to pat himself on the back. “I can't think of another actor — a comedic actor, a dramatic actor, Black, white — who's done more different types of things,” he says. But, as might be expected of a man who actively changed his signature laugh because he felt like it was getting in the way, he always hears what he sounds like when he talks about himself. “I was even a rocket ship,” Murphy continues as part of a self-flagellating reference to the 2008 disaster “Meet Dave.” “And to all the young actors, I like to tell them ‘Don't ever play a rocket ship.'”

 










Murphy acknowledges that he was churning out a lot of shit in the “Meet Dave” era, but this documentary, which happens to be produced by the company responsible for last year's “Beverly Hills Cop” legacy sequel, makes sure to insist that the actor is on another hot streak (“Being Eddie” also includes a quick mention of the actor's upcoming George Clinton biopic, which Bill Condon is slated to direct for Amazon MGM Studios). Still, there's a certain solipsism to how he presents himself here. 

On the one hand, Murphy rightly places himself alongside the most transformational Black entertainers of the 20th century, and points out that he's been a trailblazer for so long that he paved the way for Morgan Freeman — Morgan Freeman! — to have their own success. On the other hand, Murphy is also quick to fall back on the classic “I just want to make people laugh” routine whenever things get too heavy, which can imply a lack of introspection at odds with his self-knowledge. The documentary's funniest moment stems from Murphy downplaying the nuances of his own image, as film critic Elvis Mitchell pops up to articulate the metatextual significance of a scene from “Beverly Hills Cop,” only for Murphy to jump in and explain that he was just laughing at a stupid face one of his friends made off-camera. 

 










Still, the takeaway from that edit is less “I'm oblivious to my own signifiers” than it is “I know myself better than even the sharpest viewers ever could.” Does that make it any less frustrating that “Being Eddie” almost completely elides Murphy's wife and children, and — a sweet aside to his late brother Charlie notwithstanding — makes no mention of the more difficult episodes from his personal life? No, not at all. But the point here isn't for us to know who Eddie Murphy is, it's for us to know that he does. And so we're left with the sight of him flipping through the pages of a tabloid magazine that's all about him. “What a life I've had” he laughs. 

“Being Eddie” is now streaming on Netflix.

Out with the old, in with the new.

Amy Schumer deleted all of her pre-weight loss photos from her Instagram while sharing new snaps of her slimmed-down figure.

On Tuesday, the comedian shared a carousel of pictures of herself sitting on the stairs and in a swivel chair as she rocked a red strapless mini dress and a pair of black Chanel slingback heels.

“Back on my staircase bulls–t again,” she captioned the post, before thanking her glam team for “hooking a sister up.”

“I actually left my house tonight. Who's proud? I'm feeling good and happy. Deleted my old pics for no reason!” Schumer, 44, added.

The “I Feel Pretty” star's Instagram has been wiped completely clean — except for her new post.

In January, Schumer revealed she dropped 30 pounds while taking Ozempic.

Two months later, she revealed that she was now taking Mounjaro after having a “horrible” experience with Wegovy. 

“Mounjaro's been great,” she said in a now-deleted Instagram video, noting that the medicine isn't covered by insurance unless a patient has diabetes or severe obesity.

“Which most of the internet thinks I have,” Schumer quipped. “But I'm having a really good experience with it and I wanted to keep it real with you about that.”

The “Life & Beth” alum said she tried Wegovy for years but it started to make her constantly throw up.

“I couldn't handle it. I don't know if they've changed the formula, whatever,” she shared.

Recently, Schumer has shown off her new figure in swimsuits and a black mini dresses.

Last month, the “Kinda Pregnant” star put her abs on display while taking a mirror selfie in a pink sports bra and blue sweatpants.

“No filter no filler no clean mirror,” she wrote atop the photo.

	It only took one sequel and Mario's already going into outer space. During a short Nintendo Direct this morning, Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto showed off the first official trailer for next year's The Super Mario Galaxy Movie (out April 26, 2026), featuring a new look at the animated interplanetary adventure.


	The follow-up to 2023's billion-dollar hit, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, was formally revealed back in September but the Nintendo livestream breaks open the mystery block on the film's story and characters, including many familiar faces for fans of the video games.


	Watch the trailer below.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The trailer begins with a look at diminutive Bowser (Jack Black), who is now living in a tiny version of his castle after being shrunk by a mini-mushroom at the end of the previous film. He retains an antagonistic relationship with Mario (Christ Pratt) but appears to be warming up to Luigi (Charlie Day). Their banter is followed by the arrival of a new threat, Bowser Jr., who aims to break his father out of the clutches of the plumber brothers. The teaser ends with a glimpse at an action sequence wherein new character Rosalina uses her magical powers to take down a giant robot.

	











	Following the trailer, Miyamoto kicked the presentation over to Illumination CEO, Chris Meledandri, to introduce the voice actors behind the two new additions: Brie Larson (Captain Marvel) as Rosalina, the godlike overseer of the cosmos, and Benny Safdie (Oppenheimer) as Bowser Jr.. One big omission is Yoshi, Mario's longtime dinosaur pal and ridable mount — although the character rarely has speaking lines in the games.

	











	Returning in their roles from the previous film are Pratt as Mario, Day as his brother Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, and Black as Bowser.


	The new additions have been hotly debated and joked about online following the lukewarm reception to the first movie's casting — primarily focused on Chris Pratt as Mario. Despite that left-field choice, the rest of the OG voice actors were much better received, with Charlie Day and Jack Black, especially, standing out as fan-favorites. Black's Bowser became so popular, he ultimately ended up being the unofficial marketing mascot for the film, with audiences leveraging for his performance of Bowser's ballad “Peaches” to be nominated for an Academy Award (it wasn't).

	While the 2023 Super Mario Bros. movie drew inspiration from numerous games in the franchise from all different eras of Nintendo history, the new film leans more heavily into two specific titles, 2002's Super Mario Sunshine and 2007's Super Mario Galaxy. The former introduced Bowser Jr., complete with his weaponized paint brush that's seen in the trailer. Most everything else seen comes from Galaxy, which is considered one of the best entries in the entire series, as well as an all-time great 3D platformer.

	Although it was met with mediocre reviews, The Super Mario Bros. Movie was a massive success for Nintendo and Illumination, grossing over $1 billion at the box office and having an extended run topping the streaming charts after releasing digitally on Peacock. The movie's reception was big enough to effectively wash away the sour taste of 1993's live-action catastrophe, with Nintendo accelerating its plans for future feature film adaptations of its properties, including a live-action take on The Legend of Zelda, due out in 2027.


The Super Mario Galaxy Movie arrives in theaters on April 26, 2026.

The workplace sitcom follows two best friends, voiced by creator George Gendi and Javone Prince, who work at a "we're-gonna-save-the-planet type company called Ecofood," according to the plot synopsis.


							By 

	Lily Ford



	A London-set adult animated comedy Living the Dream is coming to Netflix.


	From the BAFTA-nominated George Gendi (Gumball, Apple & Onion) and Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe, the eight-part Living the Dream follows best friends Des and Ray, “a couple of really cool guys from London who should have made it big by now but haven't but still could.”




	“Instead,” reads a plot synopsis, “they're stuck at a we're-gonna-save-the-planet type company called Ecofood, doing ‘social media' for hardly any money. Now they must navigate awkward workplace romance, HR blunders, directives from the L.A. office and Ray's dad's disapproval. Could be worse, but could be much, much better.”

	The show's voice cast includes Gendi, Javone Prince, Tom Stourton, Ellie White, Chris Diamantopoulos, and Stavros Halkias, as well as Gavin and Stacey‘s Julia Davis and One Day star Ambika Mod.


	Gendi said: “If living the dream is being asked for a quote for a press release to announce my new show and then at Netflix's request, trying to make it more cheeky/funny and then doing that countless times because none of them are good enough, then I've made it. Anyway, let's see if they let me use this one.”


	Executive producers on Living the Dream are Sam Register (Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go!) and Sarah Fell and Daniel Lennard (The Wonderfully Weird World of Gumball, The Heroic Quest of the Valiant Prince Ivandoe).


	Ireland's Boulder Media is the animation studio behind the series. In addition to Gendi, writers on the series include Phoebe Walsh, Ellie White, Joe Parnham and Joe Markham.

Ariana Grande declined the chance to explain, address, or backpedal her skepticism about the 1969 moon landing upon her highly anticipated return to the Vanity Fair lie-detector test. 


	During last year's wild Wicked press tour, Grande appeared on the same YouTube series, where her co-star Cynthia Erivo asked if she thought the moon landing was fake. Grande replied, “No,” but the polygraph machine ruled her answer “inconclusive.” Her subsequent insistence that she did not believe the moon-landing conspiracy also showed some deception. 


	The viral moment was, of course, addressed when Grande returned to the hot seat with Bowen Yang as the two promoted Wicked: For Good. When Yang asked Grande if she would like a chance to redeem herself, she curtly replied, “No. I want to move past it.” 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	But Yang did not let this very pressing issue die. He asked Grande if she believed in the moon itself, to which she said, “I do.” He then asked if she believed there was a flag planted on the moon, to which Grande coyly replied, “You know, I hear both arguments.” 

	











	Grande then added forcefully, “The truth is, I don't give a rat's ass. I'm worried about Earth, goddammit! We're burning alive! We're killing each other! Can we worry about Earth for five minutes? Who gives a fuck about the moon and the flag?”

	Elsewhere during the lie-detector test, Yang interrogated Grande about group chats and attending Wimbledon with their co-star, Jonathan Bailey. Yang even got Grande to do her extremely impressive Lorne Michaels impression as she told the story of how she called the Saturday Night Live boss personally to convince him to let Yang take part in Wicked, despite some tricky scheduling.

	











	When Grande got the chance to turn the tables, she asked him several questions about the kiss they shared during a SNL sketch, including whether he thought Grande was a good kisser. Yang replied, “Yeah, you were really good,” though his answer was ruled “inconclusive.”

In the lead-up to 'Being Eddie,' the star spoke with The Hollywood Reporter to reflect on his inimitable path: "There are things that I've done that nobody else could do." 


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


Eddie Murphy is celebrating 50 years in show business with an inside look at his storied career.


	The comedy legend goes under the microscope for the Netflix documentary Being Eddie, set to begin streaming Nov. 12. Director Angus Wall's film chronicles Murphy's path from a young stand-up to a teenage castmember of Saturday Night Live to the movie star known for Beverly Hills Cop, The Nutty Professor and Shrek. The documentary features interviews with Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Jerry Seinfeld, Dave Chappelle, Tracee Ellis Ross, Chris Rock and many others.

	During an interview with The Hollywood Reporter to promote the film, the star opens up about putting previous beefs behind him. That includes patching things up with director John Landis — who appears in the doc — and also with the SNL team for his 2019 return as host. Murphy reveals the colorful way he envisions accepting a potential honorary Oscar and teases the forthcoming reboot that he's most excited to tackle — if the finished script ever arrives.

Given that you're fairly private, what made you decide to do Being Eddie, and were there off-limits topics or guidelines you wanted to set? 


	There were no guidelines. It wasn't going to be this type of documentary. [When] it started out, I was going to do stand-up comedy again. In 2011, I stopped making movies for about six years. When I got off the couch, I was like, “Let's do Dolemite [Is My Name], and go back to Saturday Night Live, and do stand-up.” We were going to do this documentary just to show what it's like to put a [stand-up] show together. Then COVID hit, and everything shut down. Afterwards, I was like, “I'm not sure if I want to do stand-up,” because I was paranoid about COVID. We worked on this thing for five, six years, and now, coincidentally, it's my 50th year in show-business — a milestone for anybody in any business.

	











The documentary teases your potential return to stand-up after all these decades. Are you getting close to doing a special or a tour? 


	I'm open to the idea of doing stand-up again. I got to be having fun for it to work, so if it hits me like that, I'll go right up there and do it.


In the film, you talk about your stand-up shows having felt heavily scrutinized once you were famous. Given the debate in recent years about cancel culture, how do you feel about the stand-up landscape? 


	I can't think of a comedian that said a joke that made them get canceled. I feel like that whole canceled thing was just a moment in time where people were like, “Comics have to be careful what they say.” If you go into clubs, the comics are talking crazier than ever. They say whatever the fuck they want to say. It's a generation that's coming up now that's defiant about that whole cancel culture shit: “Fuck that cancel culture shit. Let the chips fall where they may.” If I ever did it again, I would say what I wanted to say and do whatever I wanted to do. I'm not even thinking about getting canceled at 64, after 50 years in the business.


When I worked at Playboy, one of our most popular interviews from over the years was yours [from 1990], where you discussed tensions with John Landis. Given that he's in the film, have you two put any disagreements in the past? 


	That heat that I had with John Landis 35, 40 years ago, that's so long ago. I love John, and he directed two of the best movies of my career — Trading Places and Coming to America. For years, we've had no heat whatsoever. We even did a movie after that shit. John Landis directed Beverly Hills Cop III. The movie sucked, but we were buddies after. (Laughs.) 

	











You talk about not having won an Oscar, and there are a lot of people who feel you should have won for Dreamgirls. It bothers me when talented comedians have to leave comedy to get critical recognition. 


	I never went like, “They didn't take me seriously because I'm a comedian.” I don't even think like that. There are things that I've done that nobody else could do. Nobody else could do Nutty Professor. With Jim Carrey, nobody else could do The Grinch. To me, the performance in The Grinch is just as amazing as Robert De Niro in Raging Bull. I know comedians that blow dudes off the stage that have got Oscars.


Among your projects in the works is a potential reunion with your Dreamgirls director Bill Condon for a George Clinton movie. Is awards recognition still on your mind?


	What's on my mind is just doing good stuff and only doing stuff that I'm going to have fun doing. I don't think about winning trophies. I got a bunch of trophies. I got everything but an Oscar, and I'm not like, “This is going to get the Oscar.” The fact of the matter is, if I never win an Oscar, eventually they'll give me one of those honorary Oscars when I'm 90 years old. If they made me wait that long, I'm going to wear a sky blue tuxedo, and when they give me the Oscar, I'm going to urinate on myself while I'm giving a speech. (As an old man:) “This is a wonderful moment here.” See all the piss coming down, and they're going to play the music to make me stop pissing, and it's just going to make me piss even more. I'm just going to piss all down. They have to come take me off the stage. If they made me wait to 90, that's what I'm going to do. So they got to give me one. Otherwise, the whole thing has no credibility. 

	











I'm sure you have younger fans who may know you best for Shrek, and now we have Zendaya joining for Shrek 5. How has it been to revisit Donkey? 


	I've always said I would do Shrek forever. Donkey is a great character to play. I love the whole cast. So I was excited when it was like, “Hey, they're doing another one,” and they want to do a Donkey one, too. I'm totally into it. I come in too hot, every vocal session.


You mention in the documentary that it takes a lot out of you.


	You have a headache after a Shrek session. The donkey has a lot of singing. You're on 10, and you're doing it over and over again. The great thing, though, is it's appreciated. Everybody loves the movie. Nothing's worse than working really hard on something, and doing makeup and sweat and all this shit, and then you put it out, and they'd be like, “Two thumbs down.” You go, “I was in the makeup chair for 50 hours!” (Laughs.)


I know you've been hoping to revive the Pink Panther franchise. Have you spoken to your Bowfinger co-star Steve Martin for advice on that? 


	No, but I'm looking forward to putting my spin on it. See, I associate Pink Panther with Peter Sellers.


Of course.


	He's the original Pink Panther, and it turned into this cool thing. Other comic actors have played it, and it'd be cool to put a new spin on it. There's been a few movies in my career where it was like, “OK, I'm doing this movie because no Black person has ever done a movie like this.” It was like, a Black Dr. Dolittle? So I had to do this movie. [And] they had no Black Inspector Clouseau. That's like a Black James Bond to me. I'm just looking forward to going into this area that nobody else Black had been in before.

	











Are we getting close to production on that?


	I'm waiting on the script. (To a nearby associate:) You said that script was coming in October, and it's Nov. 3. What happened to Pink Panther? (Back to the interview:) You heard it? She said it's really close. (To his associate:) Where's Mad, Mad World, too? You said that was coming in October.


What's that one?


	A reboot [of 1963's It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]. This has been in development for, shit, almost 15 years. They can never get the script right. But right now, we got the two writers that wrote The Pickup, and they wrote the Donkey [spinoff movie] — these writers are super hot and super smart — and supposedly they're really close on A Mad, Mad World. I'm cautiously optimistic because we've been in development for so long. That's the pet project. That's the one I want to do more than anything.


We see your home's retractable roof in the documentary. Do you have to worry about bird shit?


	Just recently, we had some shit on the carpet [under] the roof. Every now and then, a bird will fly in the house. (Laughs.) Other than that, the roof is no problem. Every now and then, some shit on the carpet. Somebody come in the room and say, “There's a bird in the living room.” Oh, shit. (Laughs.)

International TV Co-Editor


Netflix is making an adult animated workplace sitcom from Apple & Onion creator George Gendi with voice cast including Ambika Mod and Julia Davis.


Living the Dream follows best friends Des and Ray, a couple of guys from London who feel they should have made it big by now. Instead they're stuck working on social media at a company called Ecofood. Now they must navigate awkward workplace romance, HR blunders, directives from the L.A. office and Ray's dad's disapproval. 


	Gendi, the BAFTA-nominated creator of Cartoon Network's Apple & Onion, will lead voice cast alongside Javone Prince, while British stars including Mod, Davis, Ellie White and Tom Stourton are aboard. Warner Bros. Animation's Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe is producing the eight-part series.

	“If living the dream is being asked for a quote for a press release to announce my new show and then at Netflix's request, trying to make it more cheeky/funny and then doing that countless times because none of them are good enough, then I've made it,” joked Gendi.

Video game movies are bigger than ever, between recent hits like “Five Nights at Freddy's” and “A Minecraft Movie” that defied box office expectations to gross massive numbers worldwide. And next year promises to have another video game to movie hit: On a Nintendo Direct on Wednesday, November 12, Nintendo released the first trailer for “The Super Mario Galaxy Movie,” the second animated film adaptation of their flagship “Mario” game series. 

A sequel to 2023's “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” which was produced by Nintendo in partnership with Illumination, the film is based on 2007's “Super Mario Galaxy,” a 3D platformer released for the Nintendo Wii console system. The game follows the plumber Mario as he — like most entries in the series — races on an adventure to save Princess Peach from the villainous Bowser. The twist for “Super Mario Galaxy” is that the game departs from the Mushroom Kingdom for an interstellar adventure, as Mario teams up with the star-shaped Luma aliens and their caretaker Rosalina to find and defeat Bowser. The entry was a massive success, selling 12.80 million units worldwide by 2020, and received significant critical acclaim, often being listed by critics as one of the greatest video games in history.

“The Super Mario Galaxy Movie” will loosely adapt the original game, with both the Lumas and Rosalia being featured. In addition, the main voice cast of the original “Super Mario Bros. Movie” will return, led by Chris Pratt as Mario, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Charlie Day as Mario's brother Luigi, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, and Kevin Michael Richardson as Bowser's right-hand man Kamek. Seth Rogen and Fred Armisen, who played Donkey Kong and Cranky Kong, were also featured in the original movie but have not been announced to return. The film is directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, who return after helming the first movie. 

 










“The Super Mario Bros. Movie” originally released in April 2023. Critical reception to the movie was mixed (IndieWire gave it a B) but the film proved tremendously successful financially, grossing $1.3 billion worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of the year behind “Barbie.” Other upcoming video game films include “Five Nights at Freddy's 2” in December and “Mortal Kombat II” in May. 

“The Super Mario Galaxy Movie” releases in theaters on April 3, 2026, almost exactly three years after the original film. Watch the full trailer below.

Mandy, Indiana have announced a new album, Urgh. The Mancunian-Parisian four-piece will release the I've Seen a Way follow-up on February 6, 2026, via their new label home of Sacred Bones. With the announcement comes a new single, “Magazine”; listen to that below.

Vocalist Valentine Caulfield shared a statement about the single that includes description of sexual violence. “‘Magazine' is the expression of the frustration and deep-seated violence I felt while attempting to recover from being raped,” she wrote. “Just like most victims of sexual assault, I will never get justice, and just like most perpetrators, my attacker will never be punished. My therapist encouraged me to channel my anger into something productive, so here it is: my primal, screaming call for retribution. It is the only way I will ever get to say to my rapist: you hurt me, so I'm going to hurt you.”

The album tracklist, also below, features billy woods on a track called “Sicko!” The record is produced by guitarist Scott Fair, with Gilla Band's Daniel Fox on co-production and mixing duties. Scroll down to see the band's forthcoming European tour dates.

EXCLUSIVE: It's been nearly a decade since Tom Ford directed a film but it looks like the multi-hyphenate has zeroed in on his next project and lined up an all-star ensemble to lead the film. 


	Sources tell Deadline Ford has confirmed that he will direct an adaptation of the Anne Rice (Interview With The Vampire) novel Cry To Heaven. The screenplay has been written by Ford, who is also directing and producing through his Fade To Black production company.


	Set in 18th century Italy, the film stars Nicholas Hoult, Aaron Taylor Johnson, Adele (in her movie debut), Ciarán Hinds, George MacKay, Mark Strong, Colin Firth, Paul Bettany, Owen Cooper, Daniel Quinn-Toye, Hunter Schafer, Josephine Thiesen, Thandiwe Newton, Theodore Pellerin, Daryl McCormack, Cassian Bilton, Hauk Hannemann, and Lux Pascal.

	











	The film is currently in pre-production in London and Rome and principal photography is set to begin in mid-January for an anticipated late autumn 2026 release. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	The original Rice novel follows the paths of two unlikely collaborators: a Venetian noble and a castrated singer from Calabria, both trying to succeed in the world of the opera. The story touches on themes of identity, betrayal, love and the pursuit of artistic and personal freedom, all ideas that fall right in Ford's wheelhouse. He has explored these themes in his filmmaking as well in the world of fashion in the past.


	Ford has been eyeing this project as his next film since last year but wanted to make sure the right cast was in place before setting a start date to begin shooting. As for financing, Ford had been talking to several studios but ultimately decided to self-finance the film and shoot on his own terms with plans to take it out to market after production has ended. The former Gucci and YSL creative director sold his Tom Ford fashion label to The Estée Lauder Companies for $2.8BN in 2023.


	The film not only marks Adele's film acting debut, but it also reunites Ford with a handful of actors from past films including Taylor-Johnson, who starred in Nocturnal Animals, and Firth who earned rave reviews and won the Volpi Cup at the Venice Film Festival for his starring role in A Single Man.












	Ford wrote, produced and directed his critically acclaimed first film A Single Man, which launched in Competition at the Venice Film Festival in 2009. The film would go on to earn an Oscar nomination, BAFTA win, as well as the AFI Film of the Year and GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding film.


	Ford's second film Nocturnal Animals won the 2016 Grand Jury prize at the Venice Film Festival and went on to receive nine BAFTA nominations, three Golden Globe nominations, including Best Director and Best Screenplay for Ford, with Taylor-Johnson winning best supporting actor, and an Academy Award Best Supporting Actor nomination for Michael Shannon.


	Ford is repped by CAA.

	Several months ago, Little Feat keyboardist, singer, and co-founder Billy Payne, along with his bandmates, heard an interesting proposition from their managers. Little Feat had just released Strike Up the Band, a well-received new album that rebooted its funky, good-time sound, and tour dates were underway. But to Payne's surprise, their team suggested it may be time to hang it up as a road band.


	“Everybody and their brother is retiring now,” says Payne. “But I'll be honest, I resisted it at first. I'll be 77 in March, and [guitarist] Fred Tackett is 80 and [bassist] Kenny [Gradney] will be 76 next year. But what's the rush on farewelling this thing?”


	Eventually, the band came around to the idea. And next year, Little Feat, the beloved group that's been blending Americana genres for over 55 years, will join the growing list of classic artists like Journey, Kiss, the Eagles, Elton John, John Baez, and Aerosmith who've completed or are in the midst of long-goodbye tours. The Last Farewell Tour, a nod to their cheeky 1975 album title The Last Record Album, will start next April and make its way around the world for at least two years (the band announced the first round of dates today). “They've hit a major high note in their sound and career,” co-manager Brian Penix, of the Nashville-based Vector, tells Rolling Stone, “and we all want to celebrate the legacy of Little Feat one more time across the globe. And in the right way, while we still can.”

	











	For Payne, several factors played into him signing on, from the schedule to age to finances. “It's not an immediate cutoff,” he says. “If it were, I would have said, ‘No, absolutely not.' But when I really thought about it, if you play a venue, you just knock it off your list and don't have to jump on a bus and go places every night, which is probably not a bad thing. And you can do residencies, if they're available, or play music with other people or do special events. It's age-related, but as a business model, I guess prices go up, since people think, ‘Oh, we need to see those guys.'”

	At this point, Little Feat have encompassed many guys. The original lineup, fronted by the roguishly charming Lowell George, blended blues, boogie, and country and emerged with now-standards like George's “Willin,'” famously covered by Linda Ronstadt. As the Seventies plowed on, their music, with Payne and guitarist Paul Barrere leading the way, tipped into jazz fusion as well. Little Feat remained, in Payne's word, “a secret surfing spot” for music heads. But they were widely respected, and 1978's Waiting for Columbus is still considered one of rock's essential live albums.


	After George died of a heart attack in 1979, the group reconvened in 1988, finally trademarked their name, and recruited a new lead singer, ex-Pure Prairie League balladeer Craig Fuller. In the decades since, Little Feat have lost other core members (Fuller departed; Barrere died in 2019) but still retain core members Payne, Gradney, and percussionist Sam Clayton and longtime guitarist Tackett, along with two recent new-blood recruits, guitarist-singer Scott Sharrard and drummer Tony Leone. “It's about the chemistry and how it sounds when people play together, and that sound is what makes this band still that band,” Payne insists. “When I played our last album for people, they said the same thing: ‘God, that sounds like Little Feat,' with smiles on their faces. I go, ‘Yeah, it does.' It's a miracle.”


	Bringing the story of Little Feat full circle will be the release of a new Little Feat recording. Written by George around 1970, “Feathers and a Smile” was an unreleased portion of “Crazy Captain Gunboat Willie Suite” from the band's debut. The new version features a vocal by Payne and a harmony from George's daughter Inara George, a singer and songwriter in her own right best known as one half of the indie pop band the Bird and the Bee. “It doesn't really morph too far from what Lowell did, although I'm playing piano instead of guitar,” Payne says. “We did that to illustrate the purity of what Lowell brought to us when we got it.”

	Inara George, who was barely of grade-school age when her father died, admits she wasn't familiar with “Feathers and a Smile” until she'd heard about Payne resurrecting it. “I haven't really ever heard my dad's version of it,” she says. “I'm not a keeper of his history, really, because I was not even five when he died.” But she jumped at the chance to record it, at last, with her father's old band. “There's a sweetness to it, an innocence, that feels like it's indicative of an earlier time,” she says. “The imagery is a little more Sixties. Part of my dad's storytelling is that he used words that were not always expected, which is something I admire.”

	











	The fact that Little Feat carried on after George's passing remains a point of contention for some hardcore fans, Payne admits. “People are not saying that directly to me, but it's out there,” he says. “And my feeling about that is that people are more than entitled to hold that opinion. People can say, ‘Oh, God, without Lowell, it's not this and that.'” He recalls attending a recent music conference in Colorado where the topic came up. “It was a tough room, a bunch of business types, promoters, and God knows who else,” he says. “As I'm ambling up to the stage for this panel, a guy in the back of the room goes, ‘Is Lowell with ya?' I grabbed the microphone, and said, ‘Yeah, he's always with us, he's part of our family, you dumb-ass.' I mean, come on. We do it without Lowell, but we're never doing it without him, and the same with Paul.”


	When George died, he was on a tour promoting a solo album, and his future with the band seemed unclear. “Paul and I did not kick him out of the band or compromise him in any way, shape, or form,” Payne says, alluding to the differences between George's rootsy style and he and Barrere's jazzier one at the time. “Unfortunately, he did that to himself. But there was this notion that we curtailed or took away his creativity. And my retort to that was, first of all, it wouldn't happen. And if it were true, why are there so few Lowell George songs on his solo album? He wasn't writing.”


	Whether Little Feat could continue without Payne, Gradney, and Clayton — mimicking classic-rock bands whose current touring lineups don't include any original members — has not yet been decided. “I think it's possible, if you take the paradigm Lowell and I set up in the beginning,” Payne muses. “We really didn't know exactly what it all meant: ‘Do we need a horn section? Do we need another guitar player? What about more vocals?' It was all kind of loose.”

	In one regard, the end of Little Feat as a touring ensemble is bittersweet for Inara George, since the band was keeping her late father's songs alive on the road. “It's so incredible that they're still playing and they're all such good musicians,” she says. “But all beautiful things come to an end, and they're doing it on their own terms, which is a great thing.”

Speaking to his brother Jason Kelce on Wednesday's “New Heights” episode, he said, “I got a little bit out of the house, went to New York.”

The tight end, 36, then explained that he didn't do anything special but just “hung out, put the feet up, saw some cool places, ate some great food and got to feel the Big City in its electricity and buzz that it's always gotten.”

“It's my favorite time as the seasons are changing to be around the Midwest and the Northeast. But yeah, it was pretty fun.”

He also pointed out that he got together with some old friends and made new ones. 

“It's cool to just kinda vibe around the city like that,” Travis added. “I think it's one of my favorite things to do in New York, it's just be one with the city and just kinda walk the streets and feel the electricity, feeling everybody doing their own s–t and meeting a few new people along the way.”

Despite not bringing up his time with his fiancée, Travis was seen going on multiple dates with Swift last week. 

On Nov. 5, the two were pictured holding hands as they arrived at The Polo Bar in Manhattan.

The very next night, the “New Heights” co-host and Swift were spotted visiting one of her favorite restaurants, Zero Bond. 

“Bachelorette” alum Jason Tartick later — who was sitting next to them for “two hours” — revealed intimate details about the couple's date night, noting that no one approached them at their table or tried to sneak a photo.

“It was a little disheartening, but also kind of made me curious is knowing the privacy they had in this room, the second they walked outside this club — there was gonna be paparazzi,” he said in a social media video. “After this, two hours of just taking it all in, her electricity, her glow, her light in a room, it's like you just can't stop looking at her.”

He also gushed over how “f–king adorable” Travis and the “Fate of Ophelia” singer, 35, were.

Kelce and Swift are in the midst of planning their wedding after getting engaged three months ago. 

The NFL star popped the question in his backyard after the couple filmed a “New Heights” episode with Jason. 

The two began dating in the summer of 2023 and went public with their relationship by September.

Jimmy Kimmel is mourning the loss of his lifelong friend, Cleto Escobedo III, the leader of the Cleto and the Cletones, the house band on Jimmy Kimmel Live!

Escobedo tragically passed away on Tuesday, Nov. 11, at the age of 59, Kimmel announced in an Instagram post. This comes after the late-night host postponed his show on Nov. 6 due to a “personal matter.”

The cause of death was not released.

Kimmel and Escobedo grew up across the street from one another in Las Vegas, so when the late-night host first got his show, he made sure that it was Escobedo providing the live music on the show since it first premiered in 2003. 

Kimmel shared a post on Nov. 11 announcing the news. 

“Early this morning, we lost a great friend, father, son, musician and man, my longtime bandleader Cleto Escobedo III,” Kimmel wrote. “To say that we are heartbroken is an understatement. Cleto and I have been inseparable since I was nine years old. The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true. Cherish your friends and please keep Cleto's wife, children and parents in your prayers.”

Many comments were left after Kimmel's sentiments. 

“So sorry to hear this Jimmy. He was AWESOME. Love to his family,” actor Eric Stonestreet wrote.

“❤️❤️❤️ love to u, cleto and his whole family,” Johnny Knoxville commented.

Ahead of the taping for the Thursday, November 6, show, ticket holders were abruptly informed that it was canceled, the New York Post reported. The episode was set to include actor David Duchovny, “Stranger Things” star Joe Keery and singer Madison Beer.

“Due to unforeseen circumstances, @jimmykimmellive needed to reschedule my performance that was originally scheduled to air tonight to a later date,” Beer wrote in a post that same day, confirming the news.

Entertainment Weekly later confirmed that it was due to a “personal matter” involving Kimmel. 

Escobedo's father, Cleto Escobado Sr. is also a member of Cleto and the Cletones, playing tenor and alto saxophones.

In January 2022, Escobedo shared a photo of himself alongside his dad to celebrate nearly 20 years of playing together and performing on television. 

“19 years of this!! Love ya Dad,” he wrote.

There are many indications that the U.S. economy might be in a recession: Mass layoffs, high inflation, Toy Story 5, to name a few. The problem is that experts likely won't know that the economy is in a recession until we're already in one. It's a wonderful system. But of all the indicators we've seen lately (calling something a recession indicator has become an enjoyable, if fatalistic meme), one theory from author Erin Baldwin of TikTok might be the most convincing—mostly because she brought receipts. Baldwin argues that People‘s Sexiest Man Alive is a recession indicator when they actually pick the right guy, and her math checks out.

“People magazine is very good at picking the right man at the wrong time, but occasionally they do get it right,” Baldwin says in the video. “Every time they've gotten it right, there's been a recession.”



The first time this happened was in 1991, when People selected Patrick Swayze as the Sexiest Man Alive. “Good choice,” Baldwin says. Two years later, People begins a period of “weird choices,” starting with the selection of Richard Gere and Cindy Crawford as the Sexiest Couple Alive. But weird turns out to be good, economically speaking, because the American economy stabilized after Hurricane Swayze. But an overzealous People can't help but make the right choice in 2000, choosing Brad Pitt, fresh off of Fight Club and Snatch, and Pierce Brosnan in 2001, just before he left Bond behind. Both are excellent choices, but unfortunately, they are the Sexiest Men Alive during the 2000 to 2001 recession. And who might you ask was the Sexiest Man Alive in 2009, at the start of the Great Recession? Hugh Jackman.

Of course, the theory is subjective and relies on you agreeing with People‘s choice. But it doesn't bode well for the country that People made the right call and named Jonathan Bailey Sexiest Man Alive last week. “We know, we nailed,” People writes. Oh, how we wish you hadn't.

Prince William brought a royal surprise to the ballroom this week. The future king made a lighthearted cameo on “Dancing with the Stars”, cheering on wildlife conservationist Robert Irwin during the show's 20th anniversary episode.

Prince William surprised fans on Tuesday during “Dancing with the Stars” Season 34. He appeared via video call to support contestant Robert Irwin and his partner, Witney Carson, who performed a Foxtrot to Leona Lewis' “Footprints in the Sand.”

William called Robert “twinkle-toes” and wished the duo luck. He signed off with a friendly wave, leaving both performers visibly shocked. People magazine reported that the moment became an instant highlight online.

Before the call, Robert told his sister Bindi Irwin and her daughter Grace that he had expected to attend Prince William's Earthshot Prize ceremony in Brazil. Instead, he said he had to tell the royal he was “still here” competing on the show. People reported that the family moment made his performance more meaningful.

Robert shared that the song choice carried extra emotion. Bindi danced to the same track during her winning season, dedicating it to their late father, Steve Irwin. “There's a lot of weight,” Robert said during rehearsal. “I really want it to be our best dance yet.”

After an emotional performance, Bindi joined her brother onstage as a photo of their parents appeared on the ballroom floor. Robert ended the dance in tears while the crowd applauded.

Judge Bruno Tonioli said Robert earned a “royal seal of approval.” Carrie Ann Inaba called the performance “powerful and profound.” Derek Hough, who previously partnered with Bindi, said he felt “honored” to be part of the Irwin family's story. He called Robert “this generation's beacon of joy.” Guest Tom Bergeron added that he was “trying not to get choked up,” recalling meeting Robert as a child.

The judges awarded the pair the season's first perfect score of 40 out of 40.

Fans quickly shared their excitement online. Hindustan Times reported that many focused on Carson's stunned reaction when William mentioned Robert by name. Viewers called the cameo “unexpected” and “adorable.”The episode also featured tributes to former contestants and celebrated 20 years of “Dancing with the Stars.” William's cheerful call added humor and heart to a milestone night, reminding audiences that even royals enjoy a good dance moment.

Prince William's warm, playful appearance may be brief, but it turned a regular competition night into one of the show's most unforgettable episodes.

The Hamilton highlights album takes the stage and hits No. 1.


													By
												

	Keith Caulfield



	It's rare that the original Broadway cast recording of Hamilton: An American Musical is not No. 1 on Billboard's weekly Cast Albums chart. (After all, it's been No. 1 for 454 weeks out of the 528 it has been on the chart since its debut in 2015.) So when Hamilton is not No. 1 — as is the case this week — it's notable.

	











	But the title that bumps Hamilton down to No. 2 this week is actually another album related to the show. A 10-song highlights edition, Hamilton: 10 Shots, arrives at No. 1 on the Nov. 15-dated chart, with 17,000 equivalent album units earned in the United States in the week ending Nov. 6, according to Luminate.


	The original Hamilton debuted at No. 1 on the Cast Albums chart dated Oct. 17, 2015, and has never left the chart.


Hamilton: 10 Shots was issued as a streaming set, digital download, CD and on an array of vinyl variants. It also debuts on a number of other Billboard charts: No. 3 on Vinyl Albums, No. 5 on Indie Store Album Sales, No. 6 on Top Album Sales, No. 6 on Top Current Album Sales and No. 28 on the overall Billboard 200.


	Meanwhile, as for the original Broadway cast recording of Hamilton, it is No. 69 on the latest Billboard 200, spending its 528th consecutive week on the chart. It extends its record for the most weeks on the chart ever for a cast recording. It peaked at No. 2 in 2020, marking the highest-charting cast recording since Hair hit No. 1 in 1969.

	











	The Billboard 200 and Cast Albums charts rank the most popular overall albums, and cast recordings, respectively, of the week in the U.S. based on multimetric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album.

This post discusses the plot of Alien: Earth.

FX will be hearing Noah Hawley scream in space (or Earth, we guess) for years to come. Earlier today, FX announced season two of Alien: Earth as part of a new overall deal with Hawley, the series creator. While many probably assumed a second season was a lock, considering how much FX spent promoting the series, the network was silent on the matter for the last few months. Viewership for the Alien reboot, which focused on a child synthetic who befriends a young Xenomorph hunter through the power of mouth sounds, was solid, particularly among Baby Boomers. However, the show ended in September, when Hawley suggested that it might take a few months to get an official word on season two. Still, unlike previous entries in the series, pretty much everyone of import survived this latest run-in with the creature that typically kills everyone. It even spared the douchey trillionaire making everyone's life miserable this season for the sake of bringing him back, we presume.

The new overall deal isn't too surprising. Since his adaptation of Fargo debuted in 2014, Hawley has been loyal to the network and its parent companies, squeezing in Legion for a few years between trips to North Dakota and the greater Twin Cities metropolitan area. In 2019, 20th Century Fox released Hawley's lone feature film, Lucy In The Sky. The point is, Hawley is a company man, which, in the world of Alien, always turns out well. The only question now is, what was with all the Ice Age stuff last season?

There is no word on when season two will premiere, but production of Alien: Earth, which is moving from Thailand to London, will begin next year.

As season 34 of Dancing with the Stars hit its stride, actress Elaine Hendrix brought fresh energy and bold movement to the ballroom when she and pro partner Alan Bersten stepped into a salsa to “It Takes Two.” The routine not only showcased Hendrix's flair and commitment, but also arrived amid a personal journey marked by injury, resilience, and a strong support network. This week's performance became a statement of intent for Hendrix one that fused rhythm, theatricality, and her long-standing passion for dance.

Hendrix faced a turning point earlier in the competition when a rib injury during rehearsal forced her out of a live performance night. She described to The Hollywood Reporter the moment when “my ribs seized up and I couldn't move,” underscoring how even seasoned performers must battle physical setbacks.. The couple receive a 36 out of 40 for their performance tonight. Rather than allowing the setback to define her journey, Hendrix called it “a moment of clarity” that reignited her love for dance. She emphasized to Decider that she's “in it to win it” and dedicated herself to rehab, choreography and studio time with added focus.

Her return to full-on rehearsal mode paved the way for the salsa to “It Takes Two,” a genre and song choice that demanded both speed and coordination. It served as a triumphant path back from adversity.

Choosing “It Takes Two” was a smart strategic move. The track's infectious energy and hip-hop-inflected beat gave the classic salsa format an extra pop. On the dance floor, Hendrix and Bersten leaned into the fun, with quick feet, dynamic turns and plenty of partner interplay.Hendrix has been vocal about feeling underrated by the scores; she acknowledged that while she doesn't fully understand the scoring criteria, she focuses on judge feedback and fan support instead. That mindset fed into her salsa: rather than chasing perfection, she chased presence. The styling played to her strengths — theatrical flair, confident frame, and an ability to engage the audience. See last week's performance below.

Hendrix emphasized how much her off-floor support has meant: longtime friend and co-star Lisa Ann Walter has attended virtually every show, serving as a “life security blanket” in Hendrix's words. Her partner Bersten echoed that this journey feels bigger than the usual competition arc.Meanwhile, Hendrix and Walter both voiced concern that Hendrix has been underscored by the judges. Walter publicly stated that her friend “deserved more” for recent performances. (US Magazine) The salsa to “It Takes Two,” therefore, carried extra significance — it was not just another dance, but an opportunity to make a statement and reclaim narrative momentum. Hendrix framed it as more than a dance: “This minute is for me, and for anyone who's ever had to push through pain to reclaim joy.”

Rounding out a strong comeback too many queer cinephiles in L.A. thought might never come, Outfest NEXT just survived its 2025 edition. Although, judging by the sound of it, a speaker inside Glendale's LOOK Dine-In Cinema Auditorium 3 did not. 

On Sunday night at a screening of Avalon Fast's “Camp,” static erupted when the audio levels on Fast's self-proclaimed “girl horror” movie got too high. “If any film was going to blow the system, it would be ‘Camp,'” the Canadian filmmaker quipped on Instagram to IndieWire, quoting a sentiment Fast heard and liked coming from the programming team. 

 










Asked for just a few nice lines about the director for IndieWire, OutFest Next's top trio of tastemakers — Sheryl Santacruz, Daniel Crooke, and Gabi Grossman, all familiar festival circuit faces with real warmth behind them — sent an effervescent text wall of sincere and complex praise via email.

“With her second feature, Avalon is showing herself to be a vital member of the genre she calls GIRL HORROR, helping to redefine the aesthetic of a new generation of transgressive, DIY, queer cinema,” the group wrote in an email. “‘Camp' is a film that, like the best works of art, feels like a divining rod to something abstract and true that you can't quite put your finger on but makes you walk through the world a little differently. It's a film about grief, the way those experiences can distort our senses of ourselves, and the extremely different ways people react to those.”

 










The word “grief” overstates the loss of a movie theater speaker by a fair bit, but the belief that human beings can, do, and perhaps should experience the world we all live in differently was clearly felt during that final programming block of Outfest Next 2025. 

A handful of festival attendees left when the audio issues persisted, but many more stayed. Some soldiered on for sheer love of Fast's story. Others got tripped up by the nature of the presentation, reframing the technical difficulty as a happy accident unprompted.

“Many thought that the speaker issue was actually a conceit of the film,” interim executive director Christopher Racster told IndieWire in a post-fest interview. “Especially because it's part of our Platinum Program, which is for more experimental films. People really wanted to see the movie, yes, but there was also this idea of like, ‘Well, maybe that's just a directorial choice!,' which was lovely — just to be able to keep going and get through that and then have the flexibility to make sure that we are honoring the filmmaker and giving them another chance to show their film for anyone who didn't have the experience they hoped for and wanted to come back.”

 










“Camp” was shown again as a matinee the next day, free of charge. “This is a film that feels deeply mystical — not in a specific religious sense — but in the sense that this film mines the mire of these characters' unmistakably queer senses of exile, pain, and alienation to find something sublime,” the programmers explained. “We think it's fitting that, of any film that would overwhelm the [sound] system that was meant to contain it, it was ‘Camp.'”

Fast's film was one of only 20 “fun, emotional, and sometimes campy” features and shorts programs picked by Outfest NEXT because they “challenge convention and expand the boundaries of LGBTQ+ representation.” That's a sharp decrease from the dozens of movies the festival used to screen back when it was an established annual event. Before Outfest picked up the “NEXT,” it ran for 11 days and took place at nine different venues, attracting as many as 70,000 guests from across the city of Los Angeles. 

In 2025, the shorter screening series had just two locations — LOOK Dine-In in Glendale and the LGBT Center's Renberg Theater. It's a stark contrast that looks like a sad story to anyone missing the context.

“Being back in a theater surrounded by members of the Outfest community felt like a homecoming, screening after screening,” the programmers wrote to IndieWire. “It also felt like an announcement: that despite a brief lull in access, visionary queer and trans cinema will always have the power to transform, engage, and empower here in the city of Los Angeles.”

 










If you're just meeting Outfest NEXT (and the beloved indie film event it used to be) for the first time this year, then you've got some real reading to do before you can say you're fully versed in the SoCal movie scene. But ask Racster to quickly sum up that 43-year history for you and the interim executive director was clear-eyed with a response he said he's been putting his heart behind for months.

“We had several goals in coming back this year,” Racster told IndieWire. “First, we wanted to take the time to make sure that our foundation was secured. There was debt when I took over and our debt is paid. We even had reserves in the bank.”

After a cataclysmic economic collapse ended Outfest in 2023, the team behind it unionized amid the push to come back. They've been officially recognized and Racster told IndieWire he's ready to get out of the way as soon as establishing infrastructure starts to inhibit community. “If we are going to learn and grow and serve the community where it is now, we need a leader who is centered in that,” he said. “And you know what? I've had my time. It's time for me to step aside once we're stable and make sure somebody else has their time.”

What they do with that time isn't about what Racster wants or even what the board wants, the interim executive director. Ensuring there is an Outfest NEXT in 2026, 2027, and beyond comes down to “talking to all the different communities that make up the LGBTQ community and asking, ‘What do you need from an organization that is hoping to serve you? What do we need to do as both a community mooring point and as [an organization that wants to] develop and promote and platform your stories?'”

 










Noting the entire Outfest NEXT team has a well-earned nap in their future, Racster said an important step had been taken by ensuring the fest returned in 2025. Still, he emphasized that the nonprofit organization needed to focus on feedback during the rebuild. Racster concluded, “Our number one job is to listen and reflect. This gave us that opportunity.” 

Even if it did take out that speaker.

Outfest NEXT returned to Los Angeles from November 6 – 9, 2025.

When astronomers first spotted the fast-moving object 3I/ATLAS hurtling through the solar system in July 2025, speculation erupted online: was it another ʻOumuamua—or even an alien craft?

Months of data from NASA, JWST, and global observatories now provide a clear answer. 3I/ATLAS is indeed interstellar, but it's not extraterrestrial technology—it's a naturally formed, billion-year-old comet from another star system.

The Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile first detected 3I/ATLAS racing across the sky at extraordinary speed.

NASA Science later confirmed its hyperbolic trajectory, proving it was unbound to the Sun and would leave the solar system after its fly-through—making it only the third confirmed interstellar object after1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.

Almost immediately, Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb suggested that its unusual motion and brightness could hint at artificial propulsion. The idea spread quickly across social media, echoing his earlier claims about ʻOumuamua. But as new data arrived, that theory began to unravel.

The first breakthrough came from the MeerKAT Radio Telescope in South Africa. Scientists detected radio emissions consistent with cometary outgassing, not engineered transmissions, as reported by LiveScience.

Subsequent James Webb Space Telescope observations revealed an unusually high carbon-dioxide to water ratio (CO₂/H₂O ≈ 8 ± 1)—among the highest recorded in any comet. This ratio, astronomers say, reflects the extreme environment in which it formed, not alien machinery.

Further analysis using polarimetric imaging found a 'deep negative polarisation branch'—a scattering pattern unseen in ordinary asteroids but consistent with fine, porous dust from interstellar comets.

Even rumours of a post-perihelion explosion were dismissed; LiveScience confirmed the object remained intact. These findings collectively closed the door on the 'alien probe' narrative.

Experts say the fascination was inevitable. With only three known interstellar visitors ever recorded, the cosmic rarity alone fuelled public imagination.

Anomalous-looking features—such as faint acceleration, odd tail direction, and slowly fading brightness—added to the intrigue.

As Newsweek noted, social media's appetite for extraterrestrial mystery amplified every ambiguous observation. Yet, each anomaly found a natural explanation once more data became available.

Far from disappointing, the real story of 3I/ATLAS is even more compelling.

According to arXiv analyses, its surface is coated by a 15–20 metre-thick crust formed by billions of years of cosmic-ray exposure—potentially making it 7 billion years old, predating our own Sun.

Its extreme CO₂ content suggests it originated near the CO₂ ice-line of a distant protoplanetary disk or endured long-term radiation in interstellar space.

For astronomers, 3I/ATLAS offers a rare glimpse into material forged under alien stellar conditions—a frozen sample of another world, not a visiting spacecraft.

Scientists say 3I/ATLAS proves that the scientific process—not speculation—unveils cosmic truth.
Each new observation has transformed initial wonder into a deeper understanding of how planetary systems form beyond our own.

It reminds skywatchers that nature itself can be as strange and wondrous as any imagined alien technology.

In the end, 3I/ATLAS is no probe—it's a natural interstellar iceberg, silently carrying the history of another star system through our skies.

Tucker Carlson is currently in the middle of a political firestorm. The once titanic Fox News personality, now a massively popular podcaster, managed to destabilize the entire MAGA movement in late October by hosting a warm conversation with white nationalist Nick Fuentes, the leader of a nihilistic and hateful right-wing youth movement. The Republican Party's commentariat class is still furiously debating the Fuentes interview, but Carlson has blithely moved on to conducting interviews about A.I. girlfriends and George Santos' prison exploits.

But Carlson's dedication to proving his “open-mindedness,” at least when it comes to certain kinds of ideas, has persisted. On Monday, he reiterated this by releasing an episode of his podcast dedicated to an exciting new topic: chemtrails.

The episode was titled “US Government Admits Chemtrails Are Real (It's Worse Than You Think).” It was a conversation with Dane Wigington, a conspiracy theorist who appears to have dedicated his professional career to exposing the government's secret use of chemtrails—toxic chemicals being deposited into the skies, in long wispy trails, by aircraft. The details of the chemtrails conspiracy theory vary, but Carlson's guest focused on a version of the theory in which the chemicals are used to seize control of the weather for both practical aims and more sinister purposes. “Destabilize the food supply by destabilizing the rain, and you destabilize the population,” the show's expert guest says at one point.

“Chemtrails” aren't real, and the “contrails” you see coming out of airplanes are largely water vapor. Nevertheless, the belief in chemtrails has been around since at least the 1990s, but it appears to have experienced a resurgence in popularity over the past year, thanks to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s MAHA movement.

This episode seems to be Carlson's first foray into the world of chemtrail conspiracy theories, but his arrival at the topic unfolded not by accident: At the start of the episode, he says that his team had spent six months trying to find a “serious, sane person with an engineering background” for the subject.

And in some ways, Carlson's amplification of chemtrail beliefs makes sense. If you believe that the government is manipulating the weather, you don't have to grapple with the real causes of climate change—and ways to address it that don't fit into your ideological box. It's a new form of climate denial for an era in which climate change is undeniable. There may be superstorms and megafires, the thinking goes, but the solution isn't a carbon tax or a push for green energy. As is often the case, the solution is to overthrow the deep-state cabal. Carlson has long preached climate denial, even back in his neocon–bow tie incarnation. And in explaining erratic climate patterns by pointing to a nefarious weather program—rather than the human-caused crisis scientists have for decades been begging the globe to address—Carlson doesn't have to admit to being wrong.

It seems inevitable that many on the right would embrace it, particularly as the movement has devolved deeper into conspiracy theories since Donald Trump's ascendancy and the COVID pandemic.

Of course, none of that is how Carlson and Co. are framing their embrace of chemtrails. In the episode, the conspiracy theory is presented as a nonpartisan exploration of science. Wigington, the guest, has some old-fashioned West Coast–granola qualities. He speaks of being a steward of the planet and of the collapse of the bee population. At one point, he remarks wistfully that forests don't smell the way they used to. Coming from Wigington, chemtrails seem like another environmental cause, with villains in the defense corporations and the U.S. military.

But the real core of Wigington's theory is that chemtrails, deposited by the U.S. government for slightly amorphous aims, serve to diffuse radiation from the sun—this may be well intentioned but shortsighted, he argues—and play a role in weather modification. These latter projects, which he describes as “the crown jewel weapon with which they can, have been, and are bringing populations to their knees,” can help redirect storms, trigger droughts, and shape weather patterns at the continental level. More importantly, the chemtrails themselves, by poisoning the atmosphere, are ultimately a kind of existential threat to all life on Earth. As Wigington notes at one point during the episode, “It's virtually dismantling the planet's primary life-support systems and ubiquitously contaminating everything everywhere.”

This is all very ominous, and Carlson accepts Wigington's assertions as truth. The host was primed, based on his own observations, to deduce that something highly suspicious was going on. As he says of contrails in the episode, “I don't remember them as a child.” He describes the basic query—what are those lines in the sky?—as “one of the questions that's been the most discouraged over the past 30 years.” The official answer can't be right, he says, because it just doesn't make sense.

There is one factor Carlson mentions that helps explain this new milestone in his journey away from typical political discourse: the pandemic. “It would be hard for my middle-aged brain to accept a lie at this scale. How could you do that? How could you hide something this big, this profound, from an entire population?” Carlson says in the episode. “Except I just saw it five years ago with the COVID vax, which was, like, a total lie. … So I know for a fact what you're describing is possible.”

Carlson may represent a substantial number of people here, in bringing a post-COVID conspiracy mindset to the real problem of a changing climate. After the fires in Hawaii and California in recent years, some tossed around ideas about space lasers. Chemtrails allow for a more unified theory of the global climate crisis, explaining wildfires, hurricanes, droughts, flooding, and erratic weather. In the episode, Wigington credits secret geoengineering for the Palisades fire, flash flooding in Texas, freezes along the Gulf Coast, and Hurricane Helene.

But Carlson is not a powerless consumer of content: He is a highly influential figure for conservative America, and he spent years undermining the public's trust in climate science. In an ironic twist, Carlson appears to come around to the idea of human-caused climate change in this discussion, but only if the humans are not on his side. In the end, it's the military, but also the media, covering it up, as well as, crucially, the scientists and environmental activists who are playing God by trying to tamper with the climate in the name of fighting global warming.

Carlson is not the only political figure to have picked up this issue. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has discussed her concerns about chemtrails. Kennedy has accused the Defense Department of being behind them. Florida and Tennessee have passed laws banning geoengineering and weather modification, based on chemtrail conspiracy theories. Other state legislatures have proposed similar laws. When these conversations first popped up in the news, many laughed it off as ridiculous. But Carlson's show, beyond platforming a facile scientific theory, demonstrates the staying power of the conspiracy mindset in the post-COVID world, beyond the realm of medicine. As Carlson notes, once you're radicalized to believe that the entire world is lying to you, it's not much of a leap to think the government controls the weather.

Paranormal Activity, one of the most recognizable franchises in modern horror, is about to do something none of the others have ever done. It's coming off the screen and into your reality as part of a brand new stage show.

The show is called, simply enough, Paranormal Activity, and after a debut in Chicago earlier this fall, it's opening at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles this week and running through December 7. From there, it'll be at the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, DC, from January 28 through February 7, followed by the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco from February 19 through March 15. It'll also be in the West End in London from December 5 through March 28.

But what exactly is this show? How is the unmistakable found footage genre going to make the leap from screen to stage? Well, io9 sat down with the show's writer, Levi Holloway, to find out.

Holloway, best known for the Broadway plays Grey House and Turret, starring Michael Shannon, came on board the project in 2023. Felix Barrett (who directed the popular immersive show Sleep No More) was already attached as director, and very quickly the pair got on the same page about what it meant to bring Paranormal Activity to the stage. “Felix and I had the same memory,” Holloway said about the original film. “It was less about the film itself and more about the marketing surrounding it. It was all the night vision and the audience kind of freaking out, and that seemed really exciting. It seemed like, ‘Well, that's just an audience. We could do that to an audience.' Not sure how, but we could do that.”

Before they solved that problem, though, Holloway needed a story. And, thankfully, the franchise's rights holder, Paramount, didn't really interfere with that. “Paramount gave us a very loose mandate,” Holloway said. “The mandate, if anything, was tonal, and it seemed to be more about, like, ‘Okay, well, is it about a couple who are beset by something?' ‘Yeah.' And that was sort of it. They were pretty hands-off. There's a huge leap of faith on their part, which we're so grateful for.”

The story that he and Barrett began working on is inspired by, but not narratively linked to, the movies in any way. Instead, it sort of mirrors their journey as creatives. Paranormal Activity is about a couple from Chicago who move to London and realize that places aren't the only thing that can be haunted. People can be haunted, too. At the time, Holloway was newly married and living in Chicago, and he traveled to London to meet with Barrett to discuss the project.

“I spent about a year over in London, doing R&D over there, and really started looking at their relationship with ghosts and stuff like that,” he said. “I wasn't really interested in the demon angle that the movies take. I'm not knocking it. It's just that in this sort of Christian structuring of that and the sort of good versus evil, God versus the devil stuff, wasn't really a story that I felt like I had a lot to add to. But I do have a lot to say about ghosts.”

Specifically, Holloway found inspiration in the Victorian spiritualist movement, which he felt “really glommed on to this idea of the afterlife and ghosts and mediums and paranormal as a way of processing grief from this massive loss in World War I.”

“So that was pretty fertile ground,” he said. “And that was a huge kickoff point for me in terms of storytelling. So you'll see some of those bones very lightly buried throughout the script.”

Holloway also found that, in addition to those historical inspirations, simply the idea of this couple moving to a new country helped give the show important staples of the horror genre. “With every good horror story, you try to figure out a way to isolate your characters because the big question is always like, ‘Why don't they run?'” Holloway said. “So you have to honor that question. And for me, the way to do that was, number one, what if places aren't haunted? What if people are haunted? You can't run from something that's in you or that is attached to you. And then the other way to isolate them is to make them strangers in a strange land, thousands of miles from everything they know.”

The writer, of course, rewatched the movies (the first and third are Holloway's favorites) and found two specific things he knew they had to recreate to make the show feel like a Paranormal Activity movie. “One is the restraint of it,” Holloway said. “For huge [amounts] of time in that first film, nothing happens. And it's in that nothing where anything becomes possible. It's very charged in its durational periods, and that was really exciting because that's anti-theatrical, right? We have this feeling when we're watching a play, people have got to be walking and talking, moving and shaking, you know? But that stillness, that negative space, those durational pauses are where you really start building a kind of electricity and charging an atmosphere with potential. And the other major ingredient was darkness. We play a lot with darkness. A huge, huge challenge, and something we are always talking about, is how do you submerge the audience in total darkness? When you do that, you're not only building a community, but you're also dislocating them… And I'm not talking about jump scares. I'm talking about breathless anticipation.”

But there's also the notion that Paranormal Activity is a found footage-driven franchise. Holloway admitted it would have been easy, and maybe obvious, to make it a more multimedia show with cameras and screens, but, instead, he and Barrett found a new way in. “[The play] fits in the movies in that it's kind of this raw gesture of weaponizing the mundane,” he said. “We wanted to capture that feeling of placing the audience in front of this sawed-off dollhouse and letting them peer into every room and sort of letting them bear witness to something maybe they shouldn't be seeing. And the audience is sort of a voyeur. Because we are voyeurs in this story, it becomes non-theatrical. It becomes kind of dangerous. It feels almost like Rear Window or something. We might as well be given binoculars to look into somebody's house.”

All of which, seemingly, could have been done without the name brand of “Paranormal Activity.” But Holloway thinks working within an established franchise was “both a gift and a burden.” “It has a very passionate built-in audience,” he said. “And, for the most part, I think the franchise is cashing the checks it writes. It's cool. It plays with the eye. It's stripped down. It's mostly placing ordinary humans in extraordinary circumstances. And that's a really cool catapult from which to launch a story. The burden of it is sort of all of those same things. As an audience, you have embedded expectations. You might meet audience members with crossed arms and say, ‘Prove it. Thrill me,' and I take that seriously. I love a good dare.”

For Holloway, that was the biggest dare of Paranormal Activity. Living up to expectations, while also giving audiences something new, exciting, and worthy. “[Found footage] is saying to the audience that this is real,” he said. “[But] you can't really do that at the theater. You can't bring an audience into a theater and make them think what's happening is real unless you subvert their expectations, which is sort of the whole kit and caboodle for us.”

Well, almost the whole thing. The Paranormal Activity franchise exists because of its sequels, and Holloway admits that while he doesn't want to look too far down the road, that is something he's thought about. “There are some very literal buns in the oven in terms of where this particular story could go, but nothing is set in stone,” he said. “Mostly, just the notebooks we have full of ideas and mischief that we want to make fit very neatly into the many more iterations in the Paranormal Activity world.”

In the modern media landscape, it can feel like there are endless streaming services available for people to choose from. Despite that, the company that popularized the concept, Netflix, remains the industry leader since it has more worldwide subscribers than any of its competitors.

Given how successful Netflix is, it is a big deal when a show becomes available or departs the streaming service. Unfortunately for fans of one of the most popular and beloved paranormal horror-drama shows ever, it is set to leave Netflix soon.

Netflix has announced that all 15 seasons of Supernatural will be leaving on December 18, 2025. That means that, as of the time of this writing, fans have just over a month, or 36 days, left to watch the show on Netflix.

As an October 2011 Screen Rant article shows, many Supernatural seasons were added to Netflix in January 2012. In November 2020, the final season of the much-beloved show became available to watch on the streaming service. That timing is interesting since the timing of when Supernatural will be leaving Netflix was decided because of when the final season was added.

Since streaming services have forever changed how TV shows are watched, people have become used to seeing series move from one to another. As a result, many people rarely think about what leads to non-original shows becoming available and leaving different streaming services. With that in mind, it is interesting to look at why Supernatural is leaving Netflix and how the departure is part of a disappointing pattern for many users.

In May 2019, Deadline published an article about the business relationship that led to Netflix becoming the home of several shows that were produced for The CW network. That article stated that the streaming service signed a deal in 2011 with CBS and Warner Bros. to make The CW's shows available to watch on Netflix. However, Deadline's article revealed that the agreement wasn't being renewed.

Even though the decision not to renew the deal was made years ago, the original agreement ensured Supernatural would remain on Netflix for a long time. According to the terms of the original deal with Warner Bros. and CBS, the shows involved in the agreement had to be exclusive to Netflix for five years after the final season was added. Since Supernatural's final season was added to Netflix in November 2020, that set up the show's upcoming December 2025 departure.

As an article from What's on Netflix outlines, several other CW shows have already left or will depart the streaming service in the months and years to come. Between September 2022 and September 2024, Reign, The Vampire Diaries, Life Sentence, The Originals, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Jane the Virgin, and iZombie all left Netflix. On the same day that Supernatural will be departing, on December 18, 2025, The 100 and Arrow will also be leaving.

Black Lightning and Supergirl will stop being available on Netflix in September and December 2026, respectively. That will be followed by September 2027, marking the end for Legends of Tomorrow, Charmed, and Legacies. December 2027 will be the month Dynasty will no longer be available on Netflix, and The Flash and Riverdale will be gone after November 2028. Finally, the last show to leave the streaming service will be All American in December 2029.

What happens when someone walks into a psychic reading completely against their will? TikToker and medium Jonathan Mark (@jonathanmarkmedium) is sharing the story of how he turned a retired NFL player from a skeptic into a believer. By the end, there wasn't any doubt left in the room.

So, a husband and wife came in for a reading, but the wife clarified that it was just for her husband. She had tricked her husband into coming under the guise that the reading was for both of them.

This guy was a retired NFL player and towered at least six feet and five inches tall.  He was definitely not Jonathan's typical client base.

He tried to get out of it, saying that he didn't believe in psychics and mediums, but she urged him to give it a chance. So, he reluctantly sat down with Jonathan and did the reading.

During the session, Jonathan mentioned his mother and brought up specific details before she passed away. They were the kind of details that could not have been known publicly.

Jonathan also referred to private things about his family, particularly his father, and revealed a family secret.

“Mind you, the entire time, he hasn't said one thing,” said Jonathan.

“The reading's done, he stands up and starts crying, hugs me, and goes, ‘This was the best thing I could ever experience.' He said he didn't know what to expect, and he's blown away, and he's been coming to me ever since.”

He walked away completely changed. Many TikTok users in the comments section admitted that they had always wanted to see a medium but were afraid of being disappointed or scammed.

“Part of me has always wanted to go to a medium to make sure my brother is okay. We lost him suddenly 24 years ago, and it just hurts still. But I guess I'm skeptical,” commented one user.

“I was a skeptic until I saw someone who gave me the name of my ex. I was visiting a different state in a town where I knew no one,” stated another.

“I've always wanted a reading since my daughter passed away, but I struggle with believing people, but I have always felt like she has a message for me! I believe my guardian angels warned me she was going to die, but I just thought it was a nightmare until she passed away,” wrote a third.

Overall, Jonathan's story highlights how powerful the idea of connection can be, especially for those dealing with grief and loss. Moments like these can offer comfort and closure in ways that plain ol' logic can't provide. It's not about convincing people; it's about creating space for healing and communication.

Vatican City

Jesus did not appear to a woman in Dozulé, France, in the 1970s, and the messages she claimed to receive, including about Jesus' second coming, are misleading and twist central Christian teachings, said the prefect of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith.

"The phenomenon of the alleged apparitions said to have taken place in Dozulé is to be regarded, definitively, as not supernatural in origin," Cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández, the prefect, wrote in a letter confirming the judgment of Bishop Jacques Habert of Bayeux-Lisieux, the local bishop.

The letter, presented to Pope Leo XIV Nov. 3, was published on the Vatican website Nov. 12.

The apparitions were reported by Madeleine Aumont, a Catholic mother of five, who claimed to have seen Jesus and received messages from him four dozen times between 1972 and 1978.

A key part of the message was that he allegedly wanted a 24-foot-tall cross to be erected outside town and supposedly said that it would have the same power as the cross on which he was crucified in Jerusalem.

But, Cardinal Fernández wrote, "that wood, raised upon Calvary, has become the real sign of Christ's sacrifice, which is unique and unrepeatable."

"For this reason, every other 'sign' of the cross -- whether devout or monumental -- cannot be considered on the same plane," he said. "Thus, it seems misleading, both theologically and pastorally-symbolically, to compare 'the Glorious Cross' of Dozulé to the Cross of Jerusalem."

Some of the alleged messages, the cardinal said, say that the construction of "the Glorious Cross" is "necessary for the salvation of the world" or is "a privileged means of obtaining universal forgiveness and peace."

However, "the Catholic faith teaches that the power of the cross does not need to be replicated, for it is already present in every Eucharist, in every church, in every believer who lives united to the sacrifice of Christ," Cardinal Fernández wrote. It is about faith not visible signs.

Jesus' cross does not need to be constructed of massive amounts of steel or concrete to be recognized, he said. "It is raised every time a heart, moved by grace, opens itself to forgiveness; every time a soul converts; every time hope is rekindled where the situation seemed impossible; and even when, by kissing a small cross, believers entrust themselves to Christ."

Even more troubling, he said, were alleged messages that referred "to the remission of sins' through the contemplation of this particular cross" that Jesus supposedly wanted built at Dozulé.

Claims that simply going to the foot of the Dozulé cross would bring the forgiveness of sins and salvation is a "theological error," the cardinal said.

The Catholic Church, Cardinal Fernández wrote, "teaches that forgiveness does not proceed from a physical location, but from Christ himself; the remission of sins is received through the sacraments -- in particular, the Sacrament of Penance -- and no material object can replace sacramental grace."

"The Cross is indeed a sign of salvation, but a cross that we construct is not, of itself, a place of automatic forgiveness, since forgiveness comes from Christ," he added.

Then, he said, there is the problem of predictions of Christ's second coming and the end of the world.

In fact, one of the alleged messages urged people to build the Dozulé cross before the end of the Holy Year 1975 because the world would not make it to the next Holy Year in 2000.

"Clearly, this purported prophecy was not fulfilled," the cardinal wrote.

"Although the theme of the Lord's return is an integral part of the Christian faith," he said, "the Church -- while recalling that Christ's return is a truth of the faith, even though no one can know or predict the precise date or its signs -- remains alert against millenarian or chronological interpretations, which risk setting the time or determining the modalities for the Final Judgment."

"The eschatological vigilance that Jesus recommends to his disciples -- to 'watch and pray' (Mt. 26:41) -- is a stable spiritual attitude, and not a temporal prediction or a geographically localized event," the cardinal wrote. "The danger of reducing Christian hope to an expectation of an imminent return with extraordinary events must be firmly avoided."

Chart-topping septet PSYCHIC FEVER continue to cement their status as steadily rising act with their latest track “SWISH DAT.” A heavy-hitting production rooted in powerful basslines and sharp lyricism, the track paints a vivid picture of strength and precision.

Layering anthemic beats and vibrant imagery with their refreshing musicality, PSYCHIC FEVER continue their momentum following their hit EP and first-ever U.S. tour with this new track which is also the original soundtrack theme for hit Japanese TV show, Masked NINJA Akakage. Energetic and charming with their ability to blend intense sonics with crisp choreography, seven-piece continue to expand their fanbase across the globe with each new release.

Three years into their musical journey, PSYCHIC FEVER – consisting of KOKORO, WEESA, TSURUGI, RYOGA, REN, JIMMY, and RYUSHIN –  continue to go from strength to strength with their bold artistry.  In conversation with Earmilk, they talk about their latest single, their sonic evolution, memorable moments and genres they'd love to experiment with.



What's the inspiration/message behind “Swish Dat”?

KOKORO: This track is themed around ‘Masked NINJA Akakage.' I aimed to capture the silence and intensity of a ninja, blending traditional Japanese elements with hip-hop sounds.

WEESA: Since it's a song tied to a drama, we created both the track and the music video to match its concept. We focused on Japanese culture, using themes like ninjas and temples.

How would you say your sound has evolved over time and where do you see it going from here? 

RYOGA: When we debuted, we explored our individuality and group direction, mainly expressing ourselves through R&B and HIP HOP. Through experiences overseas, we realized the importance of delivering music beyond genre and language, and our sound has evolved to be more open and globally conscious. Moving forward, while keeping HIP HOP and R&B in mind, we want to challenge ourselves with collaborations that transcend national and cultural boundaries. We also want to cherish our roots in Japanese culture while creating music that resonates with listeners around the world.

JIMMY: PSYCHIC FEVER has tried many genres and styles. The result of these experiments can be seen in “PSYCHIC FILE.” After producing many songs since our debut, from this year onward, we want to focus even more on HIP HOP and R&B.

As the OST for “Masked NINJA Akakage,” how do you think this particular track adds to the mood of the show? 

TSURUGIi: “SWISH DAT” is a fast-paced, tense track, which I think enhances the mood of the ninja battles depicted in Akakage.

RYUSHIN: We challenged ourselves to create a unique atmosphere by blending Japanese elements with the song. Even though it has traditional aspects, it also includes hip-hop elements, creating a daring atmosphere that fits the drama well.

If you could experiment with any genre or concepts in the future, what would they be and why?

REN: I would like to try ballads. Most of our songs are R&B, and we don't have many opportunities to perform ballads. I think ballads are an essential part of expressing various genres as PSYCHIC FEVER, so I want to challenge myself with them.

WEESA：I personally like rock, so I'd like to create a song with rock elements.

In terms of performing live, what do you enjoy most other than of course getting to connect with fans?

TSURUGI: The atmosphere of the area where we perform! I love feeling the vibe of the city as well as the local fans. I also enjoy exploring the streets, so I hope fans will show us around!

KOKORO:  I focus on how far I can push myself during the performance. Since each stage is different in terms of health and environment, it's a challenge every time, so I enjoy performing while testing myself.

What's been the most memorable moment of your music journey so far? What's on your bucket list?

REN: My first U.S. tour. Until then, we had mainly performed in Japan and Asia, but performing in the U.S. was an invaluable experience for both myself and the team. Most of the audience had never seen our performance before, but they sang and danced along with us, making it a lifelong memory.

RYUSHIN: Going to Thailand for the first time and living there for six months was very memorable. It was my first time living abroad and performing there. That experience shaped who we are today, so it's an unforgettable moment.

JIMMY: The first tours in various locations are very memorable. The solo tour in Japan was a mix of tension and great accomplishment, and the Asia and U.S. tours brought the excitement of stepping into something new. I think the strength of LDH as a whole is shown through live performances, so I want to refine our sets and lighting overseas to convey our power to the world.

Finally, if you describe PSYCHIC FEVER's artistry in 3 words what would they be and why?

RYOGA: “ENERGY,” “UNITY,” and “EVOLVE.” We want to deliver full energy on every stage. Each of the seven members has a different personality, but above all, we value the sense of unity as a team. And we are always evolving—updating our music and performance from yesterday to today, and today to tomorrow. This is our style.

KOKORO: Love, Dream, Happiness. The name of our company, “LDH,” is actually derived from these three words, which are a constant motto for us. Through our music and live entertainment, we want to share these three values with fans all around the world.

	New Zealand-based genre specialist sales outfit Black Mandala Films is bringing a fresh lineup of horror and thriller titles to the American Film Market (AFM).


	The lineup features four distinct genre offerings spanning paranormal horror to folk-influenced cosmic dread. Leading the slate is “Nightfall – A Paranormal Investigation,” a debut feature from young Australian filmmakers Myles McEwen and Ripley Stevens. 




	Set in 1988, the paranormal thriller follows investigators Mick Sutherland and Archie Charlesworth as they respond to a desperate call from Elizabeth Blair's isolated home, where they encounter a malevolent presence that unravels their sanity over seven days in what becomes known as Case 13. The cast includes Lorenzo Marte, Bill McEwen and Jack Rawlinson.

	“Beyond the Drumlins,” directed by Dan Bowhers, combines cosmic horror with folk mystery as archaeologists uncover an ancient secret beneath the Irish countryside, awakening something beyond comprehension. The cast features Michael Kowalski, Emma Jessop, Morgan DeTogne, Dan Titmuss and Goodfella Mike G.


	Filmmaker Gene Dolders brings “The Blade Cuts Deeper,” which fuses giallo aesthetics with contemporary slasher elements. The visually stylized thriller follows a narcissistic TV host who becomes trapped in his own nightmare of televised cruelty and revenge. The cast includes horror icon Laurence R. Harvey, known for “The Human Centipede 2,” and Peter Durr.


	Rounding out the slate is “The Last Supper,” a horror anthology exploring themes of food, flesh and desire. The multi-story feature aims to evoke the tonal blend of “Creepshow” and “Delicatessen” with its mix of grotesque imagery and dark humor. The anthology is directed by Craig D. Foster, Aleksandr Boikov, Marc Martínez Jordán, Doyeon Noh, Pick Poison, Christer Runde and Felipe Vargas. The project is produced by Michael Kraetzer, Nicolás Onetti and Carlos Goitia.

It's Jessica Pratt season again, and I'm in trouble.

With a voice as soft as buttered silk, creaking, candlelit compositions, and melodies that drift like autumn leaves dropped from a celestial firmament, as soon as the nights draw in, year after year, I find myself trudging back towards Jessica Pratt records. By this stage, they are more well-thumbed than David Attenborough's passport, and I'm concerned.

‘Is this it?' I wonder prematurely, at the age of 32, ‘Is this the last of the artistic infatuations?' The worry is two-fold: firstly, am I missing out on the magic of discovery by continually returning to records I know so well I can time kettle boils around them – in essence, am I becoming boring? 

Secondly, am I somehow unhealthily addicted – if my Pratt records were stolen and she pulled her music from Spotify, how would I cope? Is my mind in a mire of melancholy, mellow, magical Pratt?

I decided not to face these questions alone and sought the psychological help of Dr Michael Swift, the founder of Birmingham-based Swift Psychology and Head of Counselling at the Uprawr Mental Health Foundation. His illuminating insight assured me that I am not alone. There is a strange psychological quirk to what have become known as ‘comfort' albums.

With great relief, I learnt that my repetitive mornings (and evenings and showers for that matter) were scientifically explainable. “Familiarity reduces uncertainty, which calms the nervous system,” Dr Swift explains. “Knowing exactly what emotional arc we're about to experience creates a sense of control that becomes predictable. This is powerful in times of stress, almost like returning to a safe place in the mind.” 

While I was relieved that habitual listening was perfectly normal, I was less keen on the implication that I was perhaps routinely responding to unaddressed anxiety. I work from home in the non-too-consequential world of music journalism, so the revelation of latent morning stress would be news to me. But as I found out, there is truth to this for anyone who works from home.

When you work from home, ‘transitional rituals' are lost. Good old time-sapping commutes actually serve a vital human function, preparing you for task-oriented thinking on the way in, and unwinding on the way out. When you simultaneously start your day at home and at work, a strange cognitive dissonance can lead to a build-up of low-level stress.

So, in some way, that same old album, podcast, or background playlist is actually a form of self-medication. It's a way of priming your thought process. As Dr Swift explains, “Research shows that repeated exposure to the familiar can reduce cortisol, our primary stress hormone, which explains why comfort media is so often revisited.” 

Maybe that explains why the effortlessly calming ways of Pratt appeal so endlessly, too. “A calming record can feel addictive because it trains the brain to associate it with relief,” Dr Swift continues. “Each time the music lowers stress or helps us regulate emotion, the neural pathways for reward are strengthened.” 

He adds, “This is similar to how habits form as repetition binds the stimulus (music in this instance) and the soothing response together. Over time, the brain doesn't just enjoy the record, it begins to crave it as a form of self-regulation.” 

So, it seemed as though I had been overthinking the threat of staleness, and stressing over nothing – maybe I hadn't been listening to enough Pratt? After all, it's a harsh world out there, and if something brings you comfort, then you ought to let it consume you. But I still thought I'd pass this assumption by the psychologist.

“Repetition can absolutely be a healthy ritual, much like meditation or a morning coffee routine,” Dr Swift thankfully confirmed. “These rituals provide grounding and rhythm in daily life. But…” there was a stinging caveat, “psychology also tells us that when rituals are used to avoid discomfort (for instance, looping the same podcast to block intrusive thoughts), they can become a form of avoidance.” 

He concludes, “The difference lies in intention: psychological enhancement versus escape.” After a promising start, this felt like a crushing blow to my wintery Pratt cycle – how was I to know whether I was escaping or psychologically enhancing?

“Leaning too heavily on one comfort album can narrow our cultural diet, limiting opportunities for novelty, which is crucial for psychological growth,” Dr Dwift damningly declared. “On the other hand,” he thankfully continued, “our ‘go-to' pieces often reveal something essential about what we seek from culture: intimacy, stability, or self-awareness. Research suggests both novelty and familiarity are important for wellbeing, so the healthiest approach is balance – returning to comfort while remaining open to discovery.”

That, like Pratt's albums, was music to my ears. I return to her sound so frequently because I need it in my life. We all need our little culture crutches, it would seem, and as long as they're beautiful and meaningful, they're worth giving yourself up to. There's always the summer to blast Geese and board a booze cruise in Benidorm for a novel shake-up.

We owe it to ourselves to do both now more than ever – not specifically a balance of brooze cruises and acoustic folk, but maybe an endless Chatabix podcast in the bath and a spot of wild camping on the weekend – the bravely novel and the belovedly known. 

As Dr Swift concludes, “Our hectic lifestyles make comfort culture particularly appealing. When we are bombarded with news, notifications, and endless choice, the brain becomes fatigued by decision-making. Familiar media cuts through that overload by offering certainty and reducing cognitive demand. It's less about laziness and more about conserving mental energy in a world that rarely slows down.”

So, as I stare through the wisps of smoke lifting off a fresh brew to the whirling beauty of a beaten-up copy of Here In The Pitch beyond, I feel assured that it is not ruining my life, it is bringing it much-needed routine. I thrive off the New York apartment saudade that it serves up, and it seems I always will. Now I know that the obsession is psychologically safe, just so long as I never lose sight of the next Jessica Pratt in my life… and I may well have found it in Studio Electrophonique.

Margate-based studio Outsiders has conjured up a new identity for Supernatural – a natural wine brand "not of this earth" – with monster-like wax seals that glow in the dark and tongue-in-cheek storytelling. 

Margate-based studio Outsiders has conjured up a new identity for Supernatural – a natural wine brand "not of this earth" – with monster-like wax seals that glow in the dark and tongue-in-cheek storytelling. 

Supernatural wine – dreamt up by Palms Pizzeria founders Stu and Josh – has been brought to life by Margate studio Outsiders, with a brand that's full of folklore, mischief, and myth. It takes the world of natural wine (usually drenched in minimalism and soil references) and flips it upside down, culminating in a small-batch label that's fun, eerie, and beautifully crafted, with bottles that glow after dark.

"The founders came to us with the idea for a natural wine called Supernatural," says Outsiders co-founder Tom Lovell. "From the start, they wanted something that stood out and had a sense of irreverence. 

"We all agreed there was already some fantastic design in this category, so how do you stand out? We wanted people to be immediately drawn to it when they saw it on the shelf and to leave them with a smile."

From its witty tagline ("a natural wine brand not of this earth") to the ghostly wax-sealed tops that double as glow-in-the-dark curiosities, the desire to be different is visible through every touchpoint. It's a brand built on contradiction, as it's both handmade and otherworldly.

"For us, that tagline captured the central tension in the brand idea," says Tom Rogers, the studio's other co-founder. "Natural wine is often described through its connection to the soil, sun, and ancient process. What's the exact opposite of that? The line summed it up perfectly."

Outsiders' approach to Supernatural was grounded in the question of how you make someone pick up your bottle out of the hundreds on a dimly lit shelf. Their answer was to think beyond the label.

"We quickly realised that the neck and top of the bottle are, for the most part, completely left alone," says Lovell. "Everyone focuses on the base label, but why aren't people playing with the other 50% of the bottle? We were excited to see if that area could become an owned asset."

That discovery led to Supernatural's signature feature – its wax seals. When cooled, the wax forms eerie, organic shapes, each one slightly different, like a ghost trapped in motion. "There's a strange, ghostly energy to it," Rogers says. "That quality felt like the perfect bridge between the handcrafted and the supernatural."

Of course, no supernatural story is complete without a glow-in-the-dark moment. "We're all from the Goosebumps generation," says Lovell. "Nothing says supernatural quite like something glowing in the dark. 

"We loved the idea of these bottles living in kitchens and, when the lights are switched off, a tiny ghost floating on the shelf."

Each bottle in the collection has its own personality, from the gothic red to the ghostly white and the Frankenstein-green Pet Nat. "We wanted each to embody its own genre," says Rogers. "A red naturally felt gothic, a white became ghostly, and the green worked perfectly for Frankenstein. 
"When you wax-seal a bottle cap, it even gives Frankenstein his hairline, which felt too good not to lean into."

The duo's background in fashion and product design also shaped their approach, as evidenced by Supernatural's design as an object of desire. "We were aiming for a sense of collectability, something you'd want two of: one to drink and one to keep," says Lovell. "Ideally, you'd want the whole set."

For all the humour and character, there's no shortage of craft. The studio worked with StickerWizard to create glossy relief labels, giving each bottle a tactile, high-end finish. "At no point did we want the wit to come at the cost of communicating that it's a beautiful, low-batch natural wine," says Rogers. "We worked hard on the craft and execution so that, although it's playful, it still feels aware and design-led."

Technically, the project was as demanding as it was inventive. The team spent weeks figuring out how to get character faces onto the wax. "For a long time we thought it wasn't going to work," says Lovell. "Then Tom had a moment of inspiration and tested one of his kid's temporary tattoos on a bottle of whisky he had at home. It worked perfectly."

Even the wax itself is an innovation. "I think we can claim that as an Outsiders' invention," Rogers says. "Mixing pigments with wax very specifically to make it glow correctly whilst still reading as white in the light."

Supernatural's first three releases – Ghost (white), Vampire (red), and Frankenstein (green Pet Nat) – have already built a cult following, but the brand's world is still expanding. "The concept grows stronger with each release," says Lovell. "There's an alien-inspired skin-contact wine coming soon, and from there we'll keep branching into the paranormal, fantasy, and magical."

The studio and founders are now exploring new extensions, from glow-in-the-dark candles that fit into the bottles to ghostly gift wraps. "There are so many ways to keep building Supernatural as a brand and a product universe, not just a wine," says Rogers.

At its core, Supernatural speaks to a new kind of wine drinker – one as interested in design and storytelling as they are in tannins and terroir. "They value quality, authenticity, and originality," says Lovell. "For them, the experience matters just as much as the taste."

If one thing is certain, it's that the experience of Supernatural wines feels truly out of this world.

A viral claim circulating online suggests that an alleged NASA leak has revealed an interstellar object, identified as 3I/ATLAS, emitting unusual pulse waves at 1,420 megahertz — the same frequency long used by the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) to scan the skies for alien life. The story, fuelled by trending TikTok videos and speculative social media posts, has reignited public fascination with the possibility of intelligent communication from beyond our solar system.

3I/ATLAS, officially known as an interstellar object that entered the solar system after the famous 'Oumuamua, has been the focus of several recent astronomical studies. It drew attention again when claims emerged online that the object was sending structured radio pulse patterns detectable in the 1,420 MHz band.

The alleged frequency corresponds to the hydrogen line — a natural radio wavelength emitted by neutral hydrogen and often described as the universal channel for potential interstellar communication.

According to viral social media discussions, the reported pulses appear in a repeating numeric sequence described as 'unlike any natural emission pattern'.

One widely shared TikTok video claims the pulses are transmitted exactly at 1,420 MHz, noting that this frequency mirrors the one SETI has historically used to listen for extraterrestrial intelligence.

The video amassed thousands of views and sparked widespread debate among astronomy enthusiasts, with many drawing parallels to earlier unexplained cosmic radio signals such as the 'Wow!' signal detected in 1977.

On the other hand, some users questioned the clip as no other news channel has reported the claim.

Despite the viral claims, no peer-reviewed research or official NASA confirmation has verified that 3I/ATLAS is emitting artificial or anomalous radio waves. The most recent scientific findings, reported by WIRED, show that astronomers using South Africa's MeerKAT radio telescope detected hydroxyl absorption lines at around 1,665 MHz and 1,667 MHz — both natural signatures associated with water molecules rather than communications.

The publication emphasised that there had been no confirmed radio transmission from the interstellar body beyond these absorption detections.

The SETI Institute has previously explained that while 1,420 MHz remains a critical listening frequency, it is also naturally active in the cosmos.

Numerous natural sources, such as hydrogen clouds, can emit or absorb energy in this band. As a result, scientists treat any unverified signal reports with caution until they are corroborated by multiple observatories and instruments.

The supposed 'leak' appears to have gained traction after users on X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok reposted short clips showing radio wave visualisations alongside captions referencing a 'NASA internal recording'.

None of the posts, however, provided verifiable documentation or data. Some users also shared what they called a 'pulse sequence', a repeating numerical pattern that online communities described as a potential coded message.

The 1,420 MHz band, known as the hydrogen line, has long been considered a prime candidate for interstellar communication due to its universality and minimal interference. SETI researchers have routinely monitored this frequency for decades in the hope that intelligent life elsewhere might use it as a cosmic standard for communication.

While the alleged 3I/ATLAS transmission has not been verified, its emergence on social media highlights how scientific speculation can quickly blend with public curiosity about the search for extraterrestrial life.

Experts continue to stress that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence — and for now, no evidence beyond online chatter has confirmed the existence of any artificial signals from 3I/ATLAS.

Tucker Carlson — who has peddled several conspiracy theories over the years — dug into his bag of misleading, bonkers claims on Monday to promote the fringe chemtrails conspiracy theory on his show.

The former Fox News host — alongside a clip of the episode on X — wrote that the government “has finally admitted that chemtrails are real,” highlighting points in the video that touched on “Strange Streaks in the Sky” and the U.S. military's “Role in Climate Engineering.”

Believers in the debunked theory have linked condensation trails left behind by aircraft to some form of chemical or biological agent used to control the weather and/or manipulate the public.

The episode sees Carlson interviewing Dane Wigington, who once pushed a pseudoscientific theory that California's drought between 2011 and 2017 was the government's doing.

Carlson's post was hit with a community note on X that points out there's been no U.S. government admission confirming that chemtrails are “real.”

Critics on X hit back at the former Fox News host over the episode, including one user who called the chemtrail claims “INSULTING to even basic intelligence.”

Yes, what his guest says (and what Tucker nods along to) is insane. But it's the false framing that's the biggest problem here.No, the government did not admit "chemtrails" as described in this video are real in any way, shape, or form. They are lying to people. https://t.co/W3nqvVIMD8

I spent a decade in aviation. I can tell you: the chemtrail accusations are INSULTING to even basic intelligence.Consider the logistics:- Thousands of modified jets = STCs, manuals, inspections, paper trails- Tens of thousands of pilots, mechanics, ramp crews, dispatchers—no… https://t.co/FA68tDmEoN

The Tucker Carlson who generously hired me full time at the Daily Caller as a college student would have laughed this kind of thing out of the room. https://t.co/wzbOdm5lic

Tucker, I'm a meteorologist.Geoengineering is a real proposed idea (a very bad one at that), but it is not the same thing as alleged “chemtrails” (the ominous line-shaped clouds). Please stop confusing these two things. I testified to Congress about this in September on behalf…

Nothing but clear skies in Dallas, Texas for 40 Days during the government shutdown. The chemtrails will return by Wednesday I'm sure. 😕 pic.twitter.com/uZtD97J2aM

Moore also revealed on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" that her own children often tell her "they think I'm part alien."

 As a native of Roswell, N.M., Demi Moore has a lot of thoughts about extraterrestrials. All of which she was happy to share with Stephen Colbert, much to his — and our — amusement.


 During an appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert in support of her role on the series Landman, Moore told the host that she learned recently of his "fascination with aliens," which she thought was perfect because her own children often tell her "they think I'm part alien."


 When Colbert asked why her daughters — Tallulah, 31, Rumer, 37, and Scout, 34 — think that about her, Moore replied, "I don't know, maybe it's just because I was born in Roswell."


 The town, of course, is most famous for the 1947 "Roswell Incident," when the debris of a crashed military balloon was recovered, fueling decades of conspiracy theories of aliens, UFOs, and a rumored crash of an extraterrestrial spacecraft. Roswell has since leaned into its identity, with annual events such as the UFO Festival, the opening of the International UFO Museum, and other related tourist attractions.


 When Colbert first brought up the topic to Moore, she said, "Something definitely happened. But when I was a kid, it was never spoken about. Never. It just was not ever ever talked about, not even in passing. It was as if it was a secret."


 She added that when Hollywood came calling, with documentaries and the popular WB show, Roswell, now all of a sudden in town, "there was a museum, and now there's a somewhat comprehensive museum discussing how they shut all communication down about it."


 When Colbert pressed her on what she meant when she said something definitely happened, she demurred, "I don't know. Well, you know, the largest landing strip in America is in Roswell, so there's a lot of testing that goes on."


 When she didn't elaborate further, Colbert teased, "Legally, you can't say anything or they'll take you out," to which she joked back, "It's possible."


 Moore then turned the tables on the late-night host, asking what his fascination with aliens is. "What is not to be fascinated about?" he replied. "The possibility there are aliens, or a branch of the military that's been putting out these videos of unexplainable pill-shaped things that go into the water and come out and go from like 0 to 6,000 miles an hour with absolutely no g-force impact — I mean, what? I am not the one with the problem."

 Moore shared with Colbert that she is taking her own alien fascination to the big screen with her upcoming film Strange Arrivals, which is based on the true story of Betty and Barney Hill's alleged alien abduction. Colman Domingo will play Barney, and Moore will play Betty.
