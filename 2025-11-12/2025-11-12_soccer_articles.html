                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea skipper Reece James has sent a warning to FIFA ahead of the 2026 World Cup as he urged the football's governing body to rethink kick-off times to protect players from potentially "dangerous" heat conditions. A recent study by Queen's University Belfast found that 14 of the 16 stadiums hosting matches in North America could reach or exceed temperatures deemed unsafe for prolonged physical activity. During Chelsea's pre-tournament training sessions in Philadelphia, the team faced a severe heat warning with temperatures hitting 37°C and humidity levels pushing the perceived temperature closer to 45°C. "Thank you for asking that question, because honestly, the heat is incredible," he said. "The other day, I got a bit dizzy during a play and had to go down to the ground. Playing in this kind of temperature is very dangerous. Hopefully next year they change the schedule at least, so that it's more of a show, and football stays beautiful and exciting." James echoed those concerns and believes the solution lies in rescheduling kick-off times to cooler evening hours, especially for the games staged in southern and central US states. "It's super difficult conditions to play in that heat, especially us playing in England - there's not anything like that before," said James. "Later kick-offs when it's not so hot and humid. When asked if FIFA had got in touch with him for any feedback, he replied, "No, I haven't been asked about my thoughts on kick-off times. I'm sure they will have got some feedback." According to The BBC, FIFA is considering late-night kick-offs for matches involving major European nations to mitigate the heat issue. This could mean start times mirroring the Club World Cup's schedule, with games at 17:00, 20:00, 23:00 and even 02:00 BST. England have already secured qualification with two games to spare, and preparations are underway for the unique climate challenge that awaits them across the pond. Assistant coach Anthony Barry confirmed that the team will hold a warm-weather training camp in Florida to help players acclimatise to the conditions. Players will also undergo specific fitness conditioning to cope with the intense humidity that can sap energy and concentration. Concerns over player welfare in extreme temperatures are nothing new. The 2022 Qatar World Cup was moved to winter to avoid similar risks, but this time, with matches spread across three countries and multiple time zones, the challenge remains unprecedented. Cooling breaks will be an important tool to counter the heat, but more exhaustive measures are required to ensure player safety.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The initial prices, described last month by fan groups as “super high,” “astonishing” and “unacceptable,” were already multiple times higher than those at previous World Cups. But, sensing strong demand, FIFA raised the cost of many tickets to new record-setting heights — the first large-scale implementation of its “variable pricing” strategy. The cost of upper-deck tickets to the final also rose, with most now priced at $5,055 (up from $4,210 last month) or $3,450 (up from $2,790). Prices for many group stage games in the United States stayed stagnant. But tickets for the games in Mexico and Canada, which generally sold quicker in last month's “Visa Presale” phase, got more expensive across the board, with some prices rising by around 25%, according to screenshots and data seen by The Athletic. In most stadiums, according to color-coded maps embedded in FIFA's ticketing portal, Category 1 encompasses the entire lower bowl and most or all of the second deck. Category 4 tickets appear to be extremely scarce — confined to the upper portion of a few corner sections in the upper decks of stadiums. FIFA has not said how many tickets are available in each category. In fact, soccer's global governing body has not communicated pricing details to the general public at all, as it did ahead of past World Cups. They'd entered FIFA's second lottery, the “early ticket draw,” and won the opportunity to purchase tickets to World Cup games in their country during a so-called “domestic exclusivity period.” After hours-long waits in digital queues, they saw and revealed prices. Among the other matches subject to price hikes were: Prices for the U.S. opener at SoFi Stadium did not change — perhaps because those tickets did not sell as quick as others in the first sales phase. Prices also rose for the USMNT's third game, to: Most other tickets, at this stage, are still for matches between unknown teams. Most matchups and game locations will be determined on Dec. 5 at the World Cup draw and shortly thereafter when FIFA sets the schedule.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gennaro Gattuso confirms that Gianluca Scamacca and Giacomo Raspadori will start for Italy against Moldova tomorrow, but feels World Cup qualifying in Europe ‘needs to change.' Even with a victory here and in the final game with Norway at San Siro, it is still practically certain the Azzurri will finish runners-up due to overall goal difference. “There is absolutely nothing easy about any games, don't forget the game in Reggio Emilia four months ago,” warned Italy coach Gattuso on Sky Sport Italia. When these sides met in June, Raspadori and Andrea Cambiaso got the goals in a 2-0 victory, which was Luciano Spalletti's last on the bench. “Many people have in their minds the fact that Norway beat Moldova 11-1, but these are not players who just ran away from home and found themselves on a pitch by accident. They have their own difficulties to deal with, but tomorrow will not be a walk in the park.” Moise Kean and Nicolò Cambiaghi are among the players who pulled out due to injury, but Gattuso is not hiding his decisions. Scamacca is lacking regular playing time and match fitness, so he mustn't try to over-do it. Italy know that because of that opening 3-0 defeat in Oslo and Norway's incredible goal difference, they didn't stand a chance of recovering to top the group and secure automatic World Cup qualification. Could a win against Norway increase confidence or boost their regrets? “We do have a few issues over the criteria, because if we look at South America where six out of 10 teams go directly to the World Cup and the seventh head into a play-off with a team from Oceania, that does give you regrets. “I am honest, my mind is on tomorrow's game and not beyond that. I want to see improvement, how the players train and work together. “In my view, just having this get-together was not an easy task. We've already qualified for the play-offs, there are little aches and pains. I have to thank the likes of Barella, Calafiori and Bastoni for being here, as it was by no means to be taken for granted. “I congratulate the lads for their professionalism and hunger, which they show every day,” concluded Gattuso.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With frigid winds and snow at Toronto FC's training ground on Monday, the Canadian men's national team fine-tuned for their final two matches of 2025, starting with Ecuador on Thursday night at BMO Field (7:30 pm ET). We're expecting a loud crowd here, and that's what we're gonna need for the World Cup as we try to bring everybody, the community, behind us, because they've been great so far.” Especially after October's 1-0 loss to Australia and scoreless draw vs. Colombia. “I want everybody to start to feel that this team is good, that this team is exciting, that there's major potential in what can be achieved," said head coach Jesse Marsch. Les Rouges expect to continue building connections, especially in midfield, where Choinière, Stephen Eustáquio, Ismaël Koné, Nathan Saliba, and Jonathan Osorio are vying to be the beating hearts of the 4-4-2. “Soccer is all about chemistry and understanding each other. Our system is clear, and it's been amazing. Boots on the ground in T.O.Sur le terrain de Toronto.#CANMNT pic.twitter.com/DJk5gYjQTq Yet the November window matches on Thursday and Tuesday could potentially lead to more consistency. The overarching message, though, is a continued build. While key injuries have hampered the squad, they have added two new dual nationals: Middlesbrough center back Alfie Jones and Huddersfield Town goalkeeper Owen Goodman. Owen Goodman also has big potential to be a strong, athletic goalkeeper.” Alfie Jones has quite the Matchday -1 with the #CanMNT tomorrow.He's set to take his citizenship oath and officially become a Canadian.Then he'll wear the red and white against Ecuador at BMO Field on Thursday.More to come. When the team came together earlier in the week, both Vancouver Whitecaps FC's Ali Ahmed and Jayden Nelson approached Choinière, saying “We got you, we got you,” according to the LAFC midfielder, ahead of the Western Conference Semifinal on Nov. 22 (9:30 pm ET | MLS Season Pass, Apple TV). “Keep talking, we'll see when it comes,” Choinière responded. “I haven't been speaking to [Choinière] much,” Nelson said. After struggling in Switzerland with Grasshopper Zurich, he's hit his stride alongside Son Heung-Min at LAFC, bringing confidence into national team camp and the rest of the playoffs. On Thursday against Ecuador, he and Canada expect a “similar challenge to Colombia,” but know the primary focus is on building their identity. After wrapping up the November window, only March and June 2026 international windows remain, making every step critical – especially when it comes in front of a raucous home crowd. "We know they're very athletic, very individually talented, and that as a team, they don't give much away. So we'll be ready for it at home.” Maybe you've been a fan since day one.

The club captain made five appearances in the expanded competition, getting some first-hand experience of what the summer conditions would be like come 2026. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. New SI FC Newsletter Global Embed We're trying to prepare as best we can for that,” James told assembled media at England's press conference on Wednesday. “It's super difficult conditions to play in that heat. Especially for us playing in England, there's not anything like that before. Even more concerning was James restarting the pitch conditions conversation with less than seven months to go until the World Cup. “The pitches when we were there weren't the greatest either and made it a little bit harder. But hopefully by the time the World Cup comes around it's better,” James admitted, though he did not specify which stadiums were of concern. Chelsea played at four different stadiums in the Club World Cup, three of which will be in use at the 2026 international tournament. Former Palmeiras player, Estêvão, also called out the pitch conditions at MetLife Stadium in their group stage match against Porto. MetLife historically is a controversial venue for its synthetic turf. The eye-raising amount of season-ending injuries suffered in the NFL at the stadium raised concern initially, but natural grass was installed for the Club World Cup as required by FIFA. Still, the changes seem to be substandard in players' minds. Argentina's Emiliano Martínez and Lionel Scaloni also denounced pitch conditions during the 2024 Copa América when they played at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are no new alerts at this time England defender Reece James said his teammates must brace for “super difficult conditions” at the 2026 World Cup in North America having experienced intense summer heat during Chelsea's Club World Cup campaign earlier this year. James, who captained Chelsea at the Club World Cup held in the United States from June 14 to July 13, playing through a heatwave in Philadelphia and thunderstorms in Charlotte, said England are readying for the World Cup heat next summer. The 48-team showpiece event will feature 104 matches across 16 host cities in Canada, Mexico and the United States. Dallas, Houston, Miami, Atlanta, Monterrey, and Guadalajara, where June and July temperatures often exceed 33°C (91°F), will be tough to endure. It's super difficult conditions to play in that heat. Especially for us playing in England, there's not anything like that before,” James told reporters on Tuesday. Later kick-offs when it's not so hot and humid, that would definitely help. Matches in venues such as Vancouver, Seattle, San Francisco and Toronto are expected to offer milder conditions at next year's finals. England host Serbia on Thursday and visit Albania on Sunday in their last two World Cup qualifiers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reece James has joked he'll avoid another awkward trophy presentation with Donald Trump if the opportunity arises next summer with England. The US President's unexpected appearance at Chelsea's Club World Cup celebrations went viral following last summer's tournament. However, James laughed off the incident, insisting that if a similar situation occurred and England lifted the World Cup next summer, he would let Harry Kane handle it. The England defender smiled: "No, I don't have a plan. Trump attended as FIFA's special guest at the Club World Cup final last summer when Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain to claim the trophy at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, which will also host next year's final. James captained Chelsea to victory in July and confesses he's hoping to replicate that achievement with England at the World Cup next summer, reports the Mirror. "It's my dream, every young boy or girl's dream to be a world champion for their country. "I don't think it's related that much. It's one year apart, a completely different squad, but we'll do our best." James is confident that leadership, team spirit, and healthy competition are the key elements for success, and he's enjoyed working under his former Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, who now manages England. The key to achieving what we want and getting success is having the group's togetherness – it's not one person's leadership. In competitions you can't have a small squad. Despite Trump's odd interruption last summer, it didn't overshadow Chelsea's accomplishment, which held immense personal significance for James. Since a little boy I supported this team," he expressed at the time. That would have been enough for me. To captain the team and lead them to two trophies this season has been a dream for me."

James has also issued a warning to his England teammates of "super difficult conditions" at the World Cup having experienced intense summer heat during Chelsea's Club World Cup campaign. The defender played through conditions at both ends of the extreme weather spectrum, tasked with dealing with a heatwave in Philadelphia as well as thunderstorms in Charlotte. He said: "Everyone is aware of that. It's super difficult conditions to play in that heat. Especially for us playing in England, there's not anything like that before.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John Sorochan, a distinguished professor of turfgrass sciences and management at UT, said the university is in the "11th hour" of research as his team of faculty members, technicians and students prepare for the ultimate test after putting their work into practice earlier this year at the Club World Cup. Sorochan, who's collaborating with Michigan State University, joined Knox News on an exclusive tour at the East Tennessee AgResearch and Education Center-Plant Sciences Unit, where FIFA has built a covered facility to replicate the conditions of five domed stadiums hosting the 2025 FIFA World Cup between June 11 and July 19. Growing sod on plastic lets it develop roots, allowing UT and the growers to easily roll up the sod and place it in stadiums faster. Artificial fibers make up about 5% of the sod and provide stability as the grass grows, and each sod plot is about 2 inches thick. When combined with other technology to create a "shallow pitch," the sod can be assembled and disassembled in under 12 hours both ways. “We've come up with something that you can put in a temporary surface and still play at the highest quality level,” Sorochan said. UT uses LED grow lights to simulate how turf will grow inside the five domed stadiums in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles and Vancouver. Sorochan and his team have tested how long the lights need to be shining − about 12 hours for a full field − and when they need to be turned on. Blue sends out more energy in shorter waves to produce short, sturdy growth, while red is used as a stimulus whose longer waves help grass grow lusher. Sorochan and research associate Kyley Dickson developed the fLEX machine after an NFL game set for Mexico City had to be relocated in 2018 because the field was deemed unsafe. Sorochan returned from the experience annoyed but inspired to find a way to test fields based on how athletes will come into contact with the ground while playing, including how cleats affect turf. We put all sorts of sensors in it.” Sorochan used fLEX in the FIFA research, and several NFL teams now benefit from the technology. He sold the machine earlier this year to SGL System, a Norwegian company that develops grow lights. Sorochan points out how his team took warm-season Bermuda grass and overseeded it with cool-season ryegrass, allowing the ryegrass to sprout up and act as a stabilizer − similar to how artificial fibers are used in the sod grown on plastic. UT found success using Bermuda grass for the Club World Cup and plans to use it again for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in specific climates, though most soccer pitches are Kentucky Bluegrass. Dillon McCallum, lead technician for the FIFA research, was working for a country club when he showed an interest in turf. “If I could have told myself sophomore year of college that I was going to be working on a project that was helping assist the organization in putting on the FIFA World Cup, I would have said, 'That's crazy' and 'That sounds perfect,'" he said. Extra sand will be used for stadiums that require irrigation systems and sprinkler heads to run throughout the field. Turf at Neyland Stadium, for comparison, sits on about one foot of sand, Sorochan said. If you were to jump on the different types of turf at UT like I did, you wouldn't be able to tell a difference between them. The consistency is important for player safety, but it also ensures athletes are able to compete at the highest level − and on a level playing field − by minimizing outside factors like torn-up turf.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arthur Blank has just added to his already-impressive sports portfolio after being awarded the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL)'s latest franchise. With Boston and Denver being awarded women's soccer franchises in 2023 and 2025, respectively - both of whom will enter the NWSL for their inaugural seasons in 2026 - Atlanta is the latest city to get involved as the sport continues to see growth. AMB Sports + Entertainment is also the holding company of the NFL's Atlanta Falcons and MLS franchise Atlanta United FC, as well as the Mercedes-Benz Stadium, where its new NWSL franchise will play their home games. Blank, 83, who made his wealth as a co-founder of Home Depot, also owns the Atlanta Drive Golf Club - a Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy-led advanced tech TGL golf league - and the PGA TOUR Superstore. "We have had productive engagement with NWSL and others in its stakeholder group on the possibility of bringing an expansion franchise to Atlanta," a spokesperson for AMB Sports + Entertainment said, per The Athletic. "We have nothing to announce currently as those conversations are ongoing." Although an exact date to join the league is currently unknown, with the final details still yet needing to be ironed out, Atlanta's team is expected to debut sometime after the 2026 NWSL campaign. This would follow the trend of that of the league's 16th expansion team Denver Summit FC, after they were given the green light to join on January 30, 2025 for a then-record fee worth $110 million. This was over double that of 15th expansion team Boston Legacy's joining fee of $53 million - which USC women's basketball star JuJu Watkins has recently invested in - as has provided empirical support for the rate of growth which women's soccer, and women's sports in general, is seeing. NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman announced in September that the league would shift away from formal bidding processes to a rolling expansion process. At the time, per ESPN, she said: "We've made the decision to shift to a rolling process mostly because we've been through this, two rounds, and so, we pretty much know the universe of who's interested. With huge demand for owning a NWSL franchise, Berman also boldly stated that there is "no reason" why they can't grow the league to 32 teams like that in the NFL. It appears to be a great time for a market like Atlanta to join the NWSL, with it reportedly being the seventh-largest TV media market in the States, according to Nielsen data.

The U.S. Soccer Federation announced that it was relocating its headquarters and training center to a brand new facility in Georgia back in 2023, with Blank donating $50 million to the project. Whilst it is still currently under construction, it is expected to be fully completed ahead of the FIFA men's World Cup which takes place across the United States, Canada and Mexico in 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mauricio Pochettino's assistants have been busy racking up some airline miles lately. Over two weekends in late October and early November, they fanned out across the U.S. to watch a half-dozen World Cup hopefuls perform for their club teams in the MLS Cup playoffs. Jesus Perez, the top lieutenant for the U.S. men's national team coach, was in Texas for FC Dallas vs. Vancouver Whitecaps and Austin FC vs. LAFC. And later this month, it'll be off to Europe. It's all part of the process of making sure nothing is overlooked, no stone left unturned before May, when Pochettino must name the country's final 26-man roster for the biggest World Cup in history. The midfield duo of Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie. Star forwards Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah up top. But the last few decisions won't be easy, as the player pool is significantly deeper than it was even a year ago. Last November, the likes of left-back Max Arfsten, right-back Alex Freeman and goalkeeper Matt Freese didn't have a single cap. Now, all of three are projected to comfortably make the World Cup cut and, in Freese's case, be a starter when the curtain goes up on the biggest stage in sports next summer. "Not being arrogant, I think we are a coaching staff that has the capacity to improve players," Pochettino told me this week. "Not only young players who are between 18 and 21, but even someone like [38-year-old U.S. captain] Tim Ream. During a 16-year coaching career that included stints managing some of the world's biggest clubs, Pochettino earned a reputation for development. He fielded more than 50 academy graduates during spells at Espanyol, Southampton, Tottenham, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea. Seventeen players that he managed at club level debuted for England's national team. His 2017-18 Tottenham side had nine representatives reach at least the semis of the 2018 World Cup, more than any other team. But helping players reach new heights as an international boss is significantly more challenging. "Here, it's about how you have influence in a very short period. At some point, we have to help them in an emotional way. The important thing is to connect them with their talent, for them to feel free, and when they arrive in the national team it's an environment where they're going to be happy." Pochettino hasn't been able to spend more than a few days at a time on the training field with European-based standouts like Pulisic and McKennie. Injuries to other regulars, including Adams, striker Ricardo Pepi – along with full-back duo Sergino Dest and Antonee "Jedi" Robinson – have further reduced those opportunities. The son of Super Bowl winner Antonio Freeman wasn't even invited to January camp. But then the 21-year-old strung together a number of fine performances in his first season as a starter for Orlando City. He earned a look and took his chance, logging every minute of the Gold Cup. "Everything could be different if Sergiño arrived in a better condition in June, and we don't send him back [home]," Perez told me. "If Sergiño was there, maybe Alex Freeman doesn't play. Freeman didn't land on Pochettino's radar by accident. He and his assistants visited more than 50 clubs during their first year at the helm. Every time Pochettino or his assistants spoke to a coach or sporting director, they wanted to know the same thing: Which players in your group do you think can reach the next level? "If we go back 13 months," Perez told me, "That question helped some guys to be in the national team today." Discussions with officials at top European clubs are just as important. "I remember one conversation in Milan," Perez told me. "The [AC Milan] coach at that time said to me, ‘I feel Christian shines if he's in this space, doing this role.' "I'm not saying we take 100 percent of what they say," Perez added. It's super valuable that our colleagues give us their opinion. "We identified in these guys that there was the potential to improve," Pochettino told me in reference to Arfsten, Freeman, Freese and others. "When you compare players that were in the last World Cup to Freeman or Max, who started to play with us less than one year ago, now they match the quality of the players in Europe. It's obvious that they're now at the same level." But he won the Gold Cup job over 2022 World Cup starter Matt Turner and has now been in the lineup for 10 consecutive matches. In just a few months, he progressed from international novice to Pochettino's clear No. "It allows me to kind of play like myself," Freese said during availability on Monday when asked how much the confidence shown by Jimenez and Pochettino has helped his game. "I consistently just want to repay that trust." With Jedi sidelined indefinitely with his knee injury, Arfsten is all but certain to add to the 14 U.S. caps he's already won in 2025. "I do think I've improved this year, just in all aspects of the game," Arfsten said in a group on Tuesday. "That is a massive challenge for us," Pochettino told me. "But after one year, we know all the players. And they have started to understand what we want.
