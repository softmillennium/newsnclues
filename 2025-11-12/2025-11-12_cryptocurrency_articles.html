                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenSea unveils Meetbit, an AI-powered plush toy project merging physical collectibles with blockchain, while preparing Q1 2026 SEA token launch amid FIFA World Cup opportunities. OpenSea confirmed the launch of its AI Toy Mint, Meetbit, on Wednesday, signaling a bold new chapter for the NFT marketplace as it blends digital collectibles with real-world interaction. The project introduces Viz, an AI-powered plush toy combining adaptive intelligence with blockchain technology. The Meebits AI Toy Mint is live on @opensea! Mint your Early Access Pass to claim one of 1,000 Meebits x @CurioBeta Visitor AI-powered plush toys and unlock digital rewards.

The marketplace also confirmed its support for Art Basel Miami Beach's Zero 10 initiative, a digital-first platform connecting NFT creators to the global art economy. The event is set to be held in early December 2025. OpenSea's latest moves come after founder Devin Finzer confirmed expansion plans for 2026, including a native SEA token launch expected as early as Q1. In an exclusive interview with Coinspeaker, Atleta Network CEO Dima Saksonov discusses Web3 and sport collectibles, offering expert insights into OpenSea's recent decision to launch a native token and plans for the World Cup 2026 hosted in the US and Mexico. Regarding OpenSea's relevance to sports and collectibles today, Saksonov explains that OpenSea is still a place where many everyday collectors start, and that matters for sport. We're working with clubs and fostering our own football academies in host markets to pilot these mechanics around friendlies and fan festivals ahead of kickoff, with announcements closer to the event,” Saksonov noted. Maxi Doge is a meme-based leverage trading ecosystem that combines social entertainment with aggressive yield potential. The project offers up to 1000x leverage with no stop-loss restrictions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Solana SOL$151.70 faces renewed selling pressure as the token tumbles from $160.72 to $152.81, posting a 4.9% decline despite continued institutional support through exchange-traded fund products. Selling intensifies following another scheduled token unlock from bankrupt Alameda Research and the FTX estate on November 11. Analyst MartyParty reports approximately 193,000 SOL tokens worth $30 million get released as part of ongoing monthly vesting. The program has been gradually distributing over 8 million tokens since November 2023. These structured releases, managed under bankruptcy oversight, typically flow to major exchanges for creditor repayment. Institutional demand remains robust with solana spot ETFs recording their tenth consecutive day of inflows totaling $336 million for the week. Alameda's systematic token releases create predictable selling pressure while institutional flows provide underlying support. The bankruptcy estate maintains approximately 5 million tokens in locked or staked positions. The 60-minute analysis reveals accelerating bearish momentum as SOL breaks critical support at $156 amid explosive selling volume. However, underlying strength in ETF flows suggests institutional accumulation at lower levels. Bitwise's BSOL leads weekly inflows with $118 million while maintaining its yield-focused strategy through staking rewards averaging over 7% annually. Chart Patterns: Descending channel formation with lower highs at $156.71 and $156.13; break above $160 needed to invalidate bearish structure CoinDesk 5 Index fell from $1,792.49 to $1,759.24, declining $33.25 (-1.85%) across a $74.31 total range as strong bearish momentum emerges after failing resistance at $1,824.82, with significant institutional volume during the 15:00-16:00 selloff confirming the downward break below key support at $1,767.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin and Ethereum are struggling to stay above support zones after another wave of selling hit the market. The bullish energy that drove prices higher earlier this month is fading, and the clock is ticking for a strong recovery. Bitcoin recently faced rejection near $104,000 and slid back toward $102,000. A close below that level could open the door for another move down toward $98,000. That range has acted as support several times, but repeated retests often make it fragile. Such formations often pull prices lower before any recovery attempt begins. A brief bounce remains possible if the $98,000 support holds. Reclaiming lost ground above $104,000 would bring fresh hope of a rebound later in the month, but momentum needs to return fast. After a short recovery from around $3,000, the coin is again losing ground below resistance near $3,700. If selling continues, Ethereum may revisit the $2,800 zone, which has acted as a mid-range floor several times this year. The coin remains caught in a tight range with limited buying volume. Some smaller altcoins are holding steady or showing minor rebounds, but the overall market tone remains soft. Most digital assets are simply moving sideways while waiting for a clear shift in momentum from the top two cryptocurrencies. The next few days could decide whether Bitcoin and Ethereum hold their ground or continue sliding lower. Strong buying near current support zones would bring some relief, but a break below could trigger another correction phase. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you've attended any finance panels recently or glanced at the latest fund launches, you've probably heard about tokenisation, as it's everywhere these days. And with good reason: more than $34 billion in real-world assets have already moved on-chain, from tokenised US Treasuries to “digital gold” and even real estate. All of which makes it easy to believe that finance has finally reached its programmable, borderless future. But look closer, and the reality proves more intricate. According to recent research, most tokenised assets barely trade — BUIDL, the largest RWA token by market capitalisation, has only 85 holders, 30 active wallets, and 104 monthly transfers. For all its excitement, the RWA market remains trapped between promise and proof. And if I had to name the first thing that comes to mind when asked what's holding tokenisation back, it'd be liquidity. Most tokenised assets, whether Treasuries, funds, or private credit, hardly trade once issued, a reality confirmed by research revealing that “RWA tokens exhibit low trading volumes, long holding periods, and limited investor participation.” That meagre activity widens spreads, clouds valuations, and discourages market-makers who lack the depth to commit capital. The result is a market that looks liquid on paper but behaves like a closed loop — attractive to issue, difficult to exit. Even if liquidity forms, regulation is the next bottleneck. That means each project demands bespoke legal work and compliance mapping — a reminder that geography still decides what tokenisation can and cannot be. Yet custody, settlement, and valuation systems remain fragmented, with most pilots still running outside core banking rails. As a recent market report observed, without trusted oracles and interoperable standards, tokenisation cannot yet deliver its full promise of instant settlement and collateral efficiency. If tokenisation is to move from promise to practice, it needs firmer ground beneath, and in practice, that ground is credible, functioning secondary markets. Such dedicated secondary venues as MAS's Project Guardian liquidity pools or the UK's Digital Securities Sandbox clearly prove that when issuers, custodians, and market-makers operate on shared standards, depth follows. Liquidity incentives, transparent pricing feeds, and interoperable disclosure rules could replicate that at scale, which could finally make on-chain assets investable, not just issuable. Just as quickly, legal certainty must evolve, because a token that cannot prove title or settle under recognised custody rules will always sit at the periphery of finance. That would finally let institutions treat tokenised assets as balance-sheet eligible, paving the way for global issuance and usability. Eventually, unified-ledger prototypes, tokenised collateral networks introduced by leading global banks, and other market-grade experiments point to a future where custody, pricing, and settlement move on the same rails. But if they don't, it risks ending where NFTs did: with innovation outpacing adoption and a cycle of hype that never quite turns into habit.

Online casinos that allow wagers with cryptocurrency face numerous similar challenges in comparison to apps and sites that offer online casino games for real money. Many of the fears relate to players' skepticism about cryptocurrency and a lack of information about how to identify a legitimate crypto casino. For many individuals, doubts regarding crypto casinos simply stem from a lack of experience and knowledge. Those concerns can amplify when considering not only cryptocurrency itself but then adding in the gaming element. It's understandable to consider questions like whether you will actually collect your winnings if you get lucky playing on the casino site, for example. However, many people voice similar concerns about licensed online casinos in the U.S. like Golden Nugget Casino. Although Golden Nugget and the ilk restrict currency usage to U.S. dollars, some people still hesitate to take advantage of the Golden Nugget Online Casino promo code due to security doubts. Click here to claim the Golden Nugget Casino promo code offer for new players: If you hold cryptocurrency, it's natural to see a casino welcome bonus and be curious. These offers are also how legal sites like the BetMGM Casino app attract new players. A first positive sign is the types of cryptocurrency accepted for play. Even if the website checks all these boxes, there is still risk involved any time you play casino games. In some ways, that risk elevates when you involve cryptocurrency. Get your BetMGM Casino bonus code for new users now: The value of your cryptocurrency can be highly volatile and a comparative lack of regulation compared to online casinos that run on US dollars means you are to some degree playing at your own risk without a high level of recourse to seek remedies from potential harms.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) plans to operationalize its Singapore Dollar wholesale CBDC testnet this week to support live tokenization trials. The move will provide infrastructure for cross border settlement and tokenization transactions. MAS is adopting a hybrid approach, providing both a wholesale CBDC and an interoperability solution to interface with other DLT networks. The announcement came during a Layer One Summit speech by MAS Deputy Managing Director Leong Sing Chiong, in which he discussed several tokenization initiatives. However, he rated overall tokenization progress as “mixed, uneven and patchy” both across markets and within industries. “Trusted, open and interoperable networks will not emerge by chance. Hard work and heavy lifting are required,” he said. Singapore has been advancing this work through Project Guardian pilots and its Global Layer One initiative, which aims to develop tokenization standards and an ecosystem.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Around the world, central banks are accelerating efforts to issue their own digital currencies, known as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), to modernize financial systems and reduce reliance on private cryptocurrencies and cash. As of November 2025, 137 countries and currency unions, representing nearly the entire global economy, are actively exploring CBDCs. Yet, only a handful have successfully launched fully operational systems. This week, the United Arab Emirates became the latest nation to take a major step forward, launching a pilot of its Digital Dirham, signaling its ambitions to join the small but growing list of countries experimenting with government-backed digital currencies. We sometimes use affiliate links in our content, when clicking on those we might receive a commission at no extra cost to you. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), CBDCs are centralized and fully backed by the issuing authority. The primary goals of CBDCs vary by country — from improving cross-border payment efficiency to expanding financial inclusion and reducing the costs of handling cash. Some also see CBDCs as tools for strengthening monetary sovereignty in an increasingly digital financial landscape. The Digital Dirham is a retail CBDC pegged 1:1 to the UAE dirham (AED), built to support faster, cheaper, and more secure financial transactions. According to the UAE Central Bank, the Digital Dirham will be gradually expanded into peer-to-peer, commercial, and cross-border use cases throughout 2026, with a full launch targeted for late 2026. Officials have said the CBDC will help reduce remittance costs, a key economic driver in the Gulf, while improving transparency, security, and interoperability with other digital payment systems. Despite the global rush, only four countries have successfully launched CBDCs with full retail functionality: Its launch was driven by the Bahamas' high cash-handling costs and frequent hurricane disruptions to physical currency distribution. By mid-2025, over 200,000 wallets will have been created in a population of 400,000 — yet circulation remains below 1% of the total currency issued. Users can access the eNaira through wallet apps that support peer-to-peer and merchant payments, offline transactions, and even smart contract-based remittance tools. Launched in 2022, JAM-DEX, short for Jamaica Digital Exchange, is the country's retail CBDC issued by the Bank of Jamaica. It's pegged 1:1 to the Jamaican dollar (JMD) and operates on a centralized ledger. The CBDC was introduced to modernize Jamaica's cash-heavy economy, where nearly 28% of adults remain unbanked. Yet despite steady issuance, usage has remained modest — as of July 2024, only 257 million units were active, reflecting the broader challenge of driving CBDC adoption in a market still heavily reliant on cash. The token is backed by a basket of assets, including 40% gold reserves and U.S. dollars, making it one of the few hybrid-backed CBDCs in circulation. Introduced in 2024, ZiG was designed to stabilize Zimbabwe's volatile currency system and restore confidence after years of inflation and currency devaluation. By February 2025, ZiG accounted for 43% of formal-sector transactions, up from 26% at launch, and processed the equivalent of $480 million in pilot procurement activity. The informal economy, which dominates daily trade, still prefers the U.S. dollar, as ZiG has lost 94% of its value since launch, highlighting the difficulty of building trust in a digital currency amid persistent macroeconomic instability. A further 49 countries are currently piloting CBDCs, testing everything from cross-border trade settlements to retail payments. Beyond these headline pilots, a diverse range of countries is conducting their own CBDC experiments. Indonesia, Kazakhstan, the Philippines, and Russia are testing digital currencies for regional remittances and public-sector payments, while Sweden's e-Krona continues to explore how digital money could coexist with cash in advanced economies. In Turkey, the Digital Lira is in limited testing across government procurement, and the United Arab Emirates' Digital Dirham pilot has already executed its first successful transaction. Beyond active pilots, 72 countries are in the early or mid-stage of CBDC development. Meanwhile, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan are pushing forward with digital currency experiments focusing on tokenized deposits and wholesale systems rather than fully public CBDCs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JPM Coin represents U.S. dollar deposits held at JPMorgan and lets users send and receive money through a public blockchain within seconds, rather than waiting several days for traditional transfers. The service currently operates on Coinbase's (COIN) Base blockchain, according to Naveen Mallela, global co-head of the bank's blockchain arm, Kinexys. Deposit tokens are digital versions of bank deposits that move on blockchain networks. Mallela said deposit tokens may appeal more to large institutions because they can earn interest, which stablecoin holders do not receive. JPM Coin will also be accepted as collateral on Coinbase (COIN), adding to its usefulness for digital finance firms. JPMorgan is moving ahead of other major banks in using blockchain for payments. Its Kinexys network already handles billions in transactions daily, and the new JPM Coin could help meet growing demand for faster, round-the-clock transfers. With JPM Coin, JPMorgan is strengthening its lead in digital finance, showing how traditional banks are moving closer to real-time, blockchain-based payments. Currently, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on JPMorgan stock based on 11 Buys and six Holds. The average JPM stock price target of $340.29 indicates 7.82% upside potential from current levels.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Qian, dubbed “cryptoqueen” by British media, was arrested in April 2024 after spending years evading the authorities and living an “extravagant” lifestyle in Europe, staying in luxury hotels across the continent and buying fine jewelry and watches, prosecutors said. Police said she ran a pyramid scheme that lured more than 128,000 people to invest in her business between 2014 and 2017, including many who invested their life savings and pensions. Authorities said she stored the illegally obtained funds in Bitcoin assets. Once in London, police said she rented a “lavish” house for over 17,000 pounds ($23,000) per month, and tried but failed to buy multimillion pound properties in a bid to convert the Bitcoin. Investigators found notes Qian had written documenting her aspirations — including her “intention to become the monarch of Liberland, a self-proclaimed country consisting of a strip of land between Croatia and Serbia.” The young tycoon accused of masterminding a multibillion-dollar international fraud network They said other notes showed Qian detailing her hopes of “meeting a duke and royalty.” You lied and schemed, all the while seeking to benefit yourself,” Hales said. The businesswoman, who had pleaded guilty to money laundering offenses and transferring and possessing criminal property, was sentenced Tuesday to 11 years and eight months at Southwark Crown Court. She was sentenced alongside her accomplice Seng Hok Ling, 47, a Malaysian national who was accused of helping Qian transfer and launder the cryptocurrency. Ling was jailed at the same court for four years and 11 months after he pleaded guilty to one count of transferring criminal property.</p>
