Red Bull and Racing Bulls have announced a joint season launch alongside Ford ahead of the 2026 campaign. At the United States home of Ford in Detroit, Michigan, on January 15, the two teams will unveil their respective liveries for the next generation of cars, a season in which Red Bull Ford Powertrains will debut as both squads' power unit manufacturer. Laurent Mekies, CEO and Team Principal of Red Bull Racing, said: "The launch of the Red Bull Ford Powertrains era represents not only a bold step into the future, but a powerful expression of what's possible when world-class engineering, innovation, and passion come together. “To see the energy, precision, and scale behind this project is inspiring. We're incredibly excited to begin this new chapter, driven by the same determination and excellence that defines both Ford and Red Bull." Jim Farley, President and CEO of Ford Motor Company, added: "Since we announced our return to F1 with Red Bull, the Ford team have been working night and day to get ready for 2026. But this is about so much more than just the racing. What we will learn together with Red Bull will define the technologies of the future and that is what excites me most about this relationship." With over 125 years of heritage, innovation, and absolute dedication to performance, Ford embodies the same competitive spirit that drives our team.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's weekend to forget in Sao Paulo 2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Every Max Verstappen overtake It was a much-needed confidence boost for Alpine as well, who had not scored since before the summer break. Gasly started 13th for the Sprint but managed to fight forward to finish eighth, and his performance in the Grand Prix was just an impressive despite a top-10 starting berth. He was forced to pit early after opting for the soft tyres off the line, and had to work hard to get back through plenty of traffic and climb back into the top 10. “We managed to score one point in the Sprint and another point on Sunday, which was pretty difficult, so I'm pleased.” He then elaborated on the midfield battle, with the Frenchman getting to fight with Isack Hadjar more than once – something he was happy with, despite his fellow Frenchman eventually finishing ahead. Unfortunately, he was getting me back every time on the straight before Turn 4, so I spent quite a lot of time thinking I'm going to have nightmares about that VCARB rear wing! – they have been pretty strong this year, and just to be in that mix showed we had a good car this weekend.” Gasly scored his maiden podium at Interlagos in his Toro Rosso days, and finished on the rostrum last season for Alpine – despite the team once again having a relatively uncompetitive car. “For sure, Brazil is treating me well, but the car was just on another level compared to the last three months. So, we've just got to understand exactly why and from now, enjoy the good weekends. As for Franco Colapinto, the Argentine racer had a very up and down weekend after the announcement that he was staying at Alpine for 2026. “I think definitely after the Sprint race, we were on the back foot a bit and just struggled as a team on my car, on my side of the garage. It was easier to fix the little things on Friday, and we were in a good position already in the Sprint, then everything became a little bit more difficult.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's weekend to forget in Sao Paulo Yuki Tsunoda conceded that "nothing worked" as he suffered "one of the worst weekends" for Red Bull at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix. Yuki Tsuonda was left scratching his head after what he called “one of the worst weekends” in Brazil. Red Bull endured a difficult time in Brazil, with Max Verstappen's drive from pit lane to podium on Sunday adding some much-needed gloss. For Tsunoda, however, there was no such reprieve, as early contact with Lance Stroll earned him a 10-second penalty, while he then earned a second sanction for failing to serve the penalty correctly, before crossing the line last of the classified finishers in P17. We just struggled with the grip overall, and that's it.” Of the contact that had sent Stroll into a spin, Tsunoda added: “I don't know. Tsunoda is believed to be fighting for his Red Bull future, with Racing Bulls driver Isack Hadjar rumoured to be in the frame for a promotion. While attempting to take what positives he could from Tsunoda's performance, Red Bull Team Principal Laurent Mekies agreed with his driver's assessment of the weekend. “Of course, it's a bit unfortunate,” he said. “He lost a lot of time in that contact, got the extra 10 seconds penalty, then we made a mistake on our side, we got another 10 seconds extra penalty. “But again, it's the same thing, would and should don't win races, so we can only pocket the last strong stint in clean air that he has done.”</p>
