                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The firings and gutting of Teen Vogue come amid a hard right pivot by media companies under Trump. Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! Condé Nast is being accused of engaging in “extreme” union busting and illegal conduct after the media giant fired four union leaders and suspended five others last week, shortly after they confronted management about recent mass layoffs at Teen Vogue. Avalle said that Wednesday's march to the boss was a routine union action and, in fact, was less tense than previous actions have been. One of the fired members, Jake Lahut, is not in union leadership, but has done critical coverage of the Trump administration as a reporter for Wired. The gutting of Teen Vogue, meanwhile, seems overtly targeted at silencing a crucial left-wing publication, analysts have noted. These things all feel like they're happening at the same time and for similar issues, you know, and are coming right off of Bari Weiss and the Free Press taking over CBS, this general right-wing shift in media,” said Avalle. “By firing us, the company is trying to make examples of us — in the same way that by shuttering Teen Vogue, the company is sending a message about what progressive coverage at Condé Nast leads to,” Avalle went on. Avalle — who is trans and an advocate for trans rights — said she wouldn't say her identity is the primary reason she was fired, but likely offered a “convenient” reason for Condé Nast to terminate her. “It's just kind of one fewer liability in that sense, you know, one fewer PR thing to worry about in the future,” she said. Aizenman said that Wednesday's rally is crucial to show worker solidarity in the face of an increasingly hostile political climate. “Tonight's rally is part of a campaign to demand that our unfairly fired colleagues be reinstated and that the company rescind all illegal retaliatory discipline immediately,” Aizenman said. “In our current anti-labor, anti-journalist climate, we recognize that the stakes of this fight extend beyond our own workplace: there are implications for the entire media industry, and for workers everywhere.” Truthout relies on individual donations to publish independent journalism, free from political and corporate influence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The emails also suggest Trump spent several hours with a victim at one of Epstein's residences. Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! Newly released emails from Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender and accused trafficker who was once good friends with President Donald Trump, reveal that Trump was likely aware of the disgraced financier's misdeeds. Trump has denied having knowledge of Epstein's misconduct at the time it was taking place, but the emails reveal he knew more about what transpired than he's previously claimed. In that same message, Epstein said that Trump had “spent hours at my house” with a person who later became known as one of Epstein's sex trafficking victims. A direct email exchange from 2011 between Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, just released by House Oversight Committee Democrats. In a 2015 correspondence with Wolff, Epstein asked the author how he should handle possible press inquiries if his past association with Trump was brought up during a 2015 GOP primary election debate. and political currency,” Wolff responded, adding that Epstein should let Trump “hang himself” if he tries to deny having a previous friendship with him. “Of course he knew about the girls,” Epstein said, adding that Trump had “asked Ghislaine to stop.” It's unclear what Trump meant by asking Maxwell to “stop” — whether he was requesting that they halt their operations altogether, or simply their recruitment of girls and women from his Mar-a-Lago resort, which is reportedly one of the reasons the two had a falling out. The disclosure of the emails comes as the House of Representatives is set to reconvene following a lengthy government shutdown, and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) has announced he finally plans to seat Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva (D-Arizona), who won a special election in September but has not yet been allowed to assume her role. Johnson had blocked her from becoming a member of Congress, claiming he couldn't swear her in because the House was out of session, despite the fact that he had allowed Republicans to be sworn in earlier this year under the same circumstances.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa's official visit to Washington marks a remarkable moment – not only for Syria-US relations, but for the broader political landscape of the Middle East. Against that backdrop, al-Sharaa's current visit looks like the next step in a dialogue that has become structured, pragmatic, and increasingly institutionalized. Farouk – a cousin of Ahmed al-Sharaa's father – was a key figure of the ‘old guard' from the Hafez Assad era and later served as vice president under Bashar Assad until 2014, when his path diverged from that of the ruling establishment. That lineage adds another layer of meaning to Ahmed al-Sharaa's appearance in Washington. The family name once associated with Ba'athist orthodoxy is now linked to a new generation of Syrian leadership seeking pragmatism and legitimacy in global politics. His transformation from an Islamist dissident to a pragmatic leader capable of mediating among rival power centers – both domestic and foreign – has become a defining feature of Syria's new political reality. During the White House meeting, US President Donald Trump alluded to his guest's past with a characteristic shrug: “Everyone has a difficult past,” he said, setting a tone of blunt pragmatism that resonated throughout the visit. Al-Sharaa himself handled the issue directly but without defensiveness. In an interview with Fox News, he noted that he was only 19 during the tragic events of September 11, 2001 – “very young,” as he put it – and that the following years were a period of personal and ideological transformation. He deliberately positioned himself as a man who outgrew radicalism and embraced statecraft. According to al-Sharaa, his discussions with the US president focused “not on the past, but on the present and future of Syria,” which Washington increasingly sees as both a geopolitical actor and a potential economic partner. The move, though largely symbolic, suggested a willingness to test new terms of engagement. In al-Sharaa's own words, these measures reflected a “new perception” of Syria. Yet, behind this rhetoric of optimism, the situation is far from straightforward. Despite bold talk of sanctions relief, the reality is far more limited. Washington has only suspended a few provisions of the Caesar Act for 180 days – a temporary measure authorized by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Moreover, any export of dual-use goods still requires special approval from the US authorities. In practice, this means Washington continues to maintain a firm economic grip on Damascus. Talk of “restoring sovereignty” sounds at this stage more like diplomatic rhetoric than a genuine policy shift. As much as Damascus wants to restore trade and attract investment, it also recognizes that the Caesar Act remains a powerful lever for Washington to dictate the terms of engagement. This asymmetric dynamic leaves Syria in a gray zone – formally sovereign, but still economically dependent on external approval. A second and perhaps even deeper obstacle lies in Syria's unwavering stance on Israel. While al-Sharaa's rhetoric has been noticeably moderate – he called on West Jerusalem to “exercise restraint” following Israeli airstrikes – he has categorically refused to join the Abraham Accords. For Washington, this came as a disappointment: The White House had hoped that Syria might be ready for gradual normalization with the Jewish state. This position is embedded in Syria's national identity and political culture. No government – whether that of Hafez Assad, Bashar Assad, or Ahmed al-Sharaa – can afford to renounce it without losing legitimacy at home. The Kurdish issue remains another unresolved pillar of Syria-US relations. Damascus, however, views Kurdish autonomy as a direct challenge to Syria's territorial integrity. These regions, rich in oil and gas, also represent a vital economic resource that Damascus cannot easily concede. Both Democrats and Republicans see their presence there as a strategic foothold. As a result, any dialogue between Washington and Damascus will inevitably run into questions of internal sovereignty – an obstacle that no diplomatic handshake can easily resolve. This makes the issue of funding reconstruction both politically and morally charged. With budget constraints at home and opposition in Congress, Washington's willingness to underwrite rebuilding efforts is minimal. Many believe al-Sharaa's status as ‘interim president' is too uncertain to justify long-term engagement. Economic cooperation – even limited – signals legitimacy and political rehabilitation. Al-Sharaa's government hopes that selective easing of sanctions could attract Gulf or European investors, opening pathways that remain formally consistent with US policy. Yet, without a full lifting of restrictions, Syria's economy remains confined to a narrow channel, its growth potential limited by Western approval mechanisms. His approach has been marked by deliberate balance – a state-centric pragmatism that seeks stability rather than ideological alignment. His first official visit after taking office was to Moscow, where he met with President Vladimir Putin and reaffirmed the continuity of strategic cooperation. The order of these visits was symbolic: It underscored Syria's intention to preserve its partnership with Russia while opening a new channel to the US. Al-Sharaa has also made clear that he supports Russia's continued military presence in Tartus and Khmeimim, calling it a stabilizing factor in Syria's security architecture. In his view, Russian bases act as deterrents against extremism and external interference – an argument that finds tacit understanding even among other regional actors, from Türkiye to the Gulf monarchies. These countries, while wary of Moscow's influence, recognize that the Russian military footprint contributes to regional balance and prevents the re-emergence of chaos. Relations with Iran remain the most delicate dimension of al-Sharaa's foreign policy. While Syria and Iran shared close ties during the war, Damascus has lately shown caution in its dealings with Tehran. The new administration appears intent on redefining this relationship in more transactional, less ideological terms. This triangular dynamic – with Russia balancing between Iran and Syria – is acceptable to other regional powers as well, including Türkiye and the Gulf states, all of whom seek to prevent another destabilizing escalation. The White House, too, is aware of these undercurrents. Despite rhetoric about Syria's ‘democratization', Washington understands that pushing Damascus away from Moscow could easily backfire, reigniting the very instability the region is trying to contain. Taken together, these developments reveal a Syrian leadership that is learning to navigate the multipolar order with growing sophistication. His foreign policy is built on cautious multi-vector diplomacy aimed at one overriding goal: Safeguarding Syria's sovereignty and security in a world where both are constantly under pressure. In that sense, his visit to Washington was indeed historic. It broke long-standing taboos, softened rhetoric, and produced a few tangible outcomes. But to call it a new era in Syria–US relations would be premature. Deep structural contradictions – sanctions, Israel, the Kurds, and reconstruction – remain unresolved. Until these are addressed institutionally rather than symbolically, the partnership will stay limited and fragile.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was forced Wednesday to address reports that rivals in his Labour Party are plotting to replace him as leader, just two weeks ahead of a government budget announcement that could worsen his already dire poll ratings. Several British news outlets quoted Starmer allies late Tuesday saying his job might be under immediate threat and singling out Wes Streeting, the health secretary, as a challenger whose “ambition” was being viewed with “particular suspicion.” Those same allies briefed that Starmer would fight any challenge to his leadership. By Wednesday afternoon, what might have remained as trivial political gossip had snowballed into a full-blown crisis. Accused by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch of presiding over a “toxic” culture in Downing Street, Starmer was forced to address the reports that his allies were briefing against senior members of his government. Starmer told Parliament that he had not authorized the negative briefings against his colleagues. The latest crisis to hit the government comes ahead of a budget announcement on November 26, when Labour – in order to fill a fiscal black hole – is expected to break a key election pledge by increasing the basic rate of income tax for the first time in half a century. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has indicated that both tax rises and spending cuts are possible when she lays out her plans for the year ahead, seeking to cut government debt. That would likely spur further attacks from Nigel Farage, whose upstart anti-immigrant Reform UK party has led Labour in national polls for months. Starmer's popularity went into freefall soon after Labour won a landslide general election victory in July 2024. YouGov, a pollster, said this month that just 17% of Britons approve of the job Starmer is doing as prime minister, while 73% disapprove. The decision by Starmer's allies to brief against Streeting, the minister tasked with repairing Britain's depleted National Health Service, bewildered and blindsided many Labour Party politicians and has raised questions about the prime minister's control of his governing operation in Downing Street. “People are flummoxed,” one Labour MP, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told CNN. “Nobody quite understands where this briefing is coming from.” After an unsteady first 16 months in office left Starmer one of the most unpopular British prime ministers on record, Labour MPs had previously signaled that the prime minister would not face a serious leadership contest until after local elections in May 2026, giving his government time to reverse its decline in the polls. Keir Starmer is polling as the UK's most unpopular prime minister on record. Despite Streeting's denial that he is seeking to challenge for the leadership of the Labour Party, a “Wes for Leader” website was created on Tuesday. Rumors of a leadership challenge last swirled in September, when Andy Burnham – a former MP and the current mayor of Greater Manchester – launched an audacious and abortive attempt at challenging Starmer's approach on the eve of Labour's annual conference.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The House on Wednesday was poised to vote on legislation that would end the longest government shutdown in US history, as Democrats voice fury that the Senate-brokered compromise fails to extend expiring healthcare subsidies. The House speaker, Mike Johnson, has instructed lawmakers to return to Washington after keeping the chamber out of session for more than 50 days. Influential progressive groups have even called for Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, to resign. All Republicans supported the measure's passage, except for Rand Paul of Kentucky, along with eight moderate members of the Democratic caucus, several of whom were recently re-elected, or serving their final terms in office. “Where the hell have you been?” he asked, during in his opening remarks adding later: “Republicans quiet quit their jobs. Virginia Foxx, the committee's chair, blamed Democrats for causing the shut down, and noted sharply they walked away “empty handed” after insisting they would not relent until securing an extension of the enhanced healthcare subsidies. If the subsidies expire, millions of Americans could see sharp rises in their healthcare premiums or lose their marketplace coverage entirely. The short-term government funding bill would extend government funding at current levels through January 2026 along with three year-long provisions that will fund programs at the Department of Veterans Affairs, the USDA and FDA, and legislative branch operations. The continuing resolution also includes language to stop mass federal firings and reverse dismissals that occurred during the shutdown – prohibiting additional reductions until the end of January – and guarantees back pay to workers who have spent weeks without paychecks. Speaking Tuesday at a press conference on Capitol Hill, Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, said it was his “strong expectation” that House Democrats will vote against the proposal. He joined a group of Democratic lawmakers to unveil an amendment that would extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits for three years. With a 219-member majority assuming full attendance, Johnson can only afford to lose two votes on the bill, and the Kentucky representative Thomas Massie is likely to vote no. But Republican leaders have expressed optimism that the legislation would pass on Wednesday, and be sent to Trump for his signature. Addressing a crowd at Arlington National Cemetery on Tuesday, Veterans day, Trump congratulated Johnson, calling the Senate bill a “very big victory”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. Earlier on Nov. 12, President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Hrynchuk and Halushchenko to resign. Halushchenko is being investigated by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) as part of a large-scale corruption case into state nuclear power company Energoatom involving Timur Mindich, a close associate of Zelensky. When asked by the Slidstvo.info investigative journalism project, Hrynchuk said she "has not heard about it." "This is, among other things, a matter of trust. Zelensky added that he had asked Svyrydenko to "ensure that these ministers submit resignation letters" and asked the Ukrainian parliament to support their resignations. "Right now, things are extremely difficult for everyone in Ukraine — enduring power outages, Russian strikes, and losses," Zelensky added. "It is absolutely unacceptable that, on top of this, there are still some (corruption) schemes in the energy sector." An extraordinary meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers has suspended Halushchenko and appointed Lyudmila Suhak, deputy justice minister for European integration, as acting justice minister, Svyrydenko said on Telegram. "I fully agree: a political decision needs to be made first, and only then should we deal with all the details," he added. I believe that suspension during the investigation is a civilized and proper course of action. I will defend myself in the legal domain and prove my position.” Meanwhile, Halushchenko's critics argued that suspension was not sufficient. Two ministers must either resign or be dismissed from their positions by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine," Anastasia Radina, head of the Ukrainian parliament's anti-corruption committee, wrote on Facebook in an apparent reference to Halushchenko and Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk. Halushchenko, who is sometimes identified as "energy minister" and sometimes by the code name "Professor," features in audio recordings published by the NABU. In the NABU tapes, suspects Ihor Myroniuk and Dmytro Basov appear to divide kickbacks between themselves and "Professor" — an alleged reference to Halushchenko. "We will (divide) it by three: you, me and Professor," Myroniuk said in the recordings. Myroniuk, who has also been charged in the case, is a former advisor to Halushchenko. Anti-corruption prosecutor Serhiy Savytskyi said at a court hearing on Nov. 11 that Mindich had allegedly committed his crimes by unlawfully influencing Halushchenko. In the tapes, there is a conversation between Mindich and Halushchenko. Mindich also discusses receiving money from another suspect, Oleksandr Tsukerman, in the recordings. An anti-corruption prosecutor said at a court hearing on Nov. 12 that, according to the NABU tapes, Zelensky had called Halushchenko during a conversation between the minister, Mindich and Tsukerman. Zelensky's press service did not respond to a request for comment. Halushchenko had been involved in several corruption scandals even before the ongoing Energoatom case. He was the executive director for legal support at Energoatom from 2013 to 2014 and a vice president at the company from 2020 to 2021. Halushchenko has also taught law at Kyiv National University's International Relations Institute. Oleg Sukhov is a reporter at the Kyiv Independent. He is a former editor and reporter at the Moscow Times. He has a master's degree in history from the Moscow State University. He moved to Ukraine in 2014 due to the crackdown on independent media in Russia and covered war, corruption, reforms and law enforcement for the Kyiv Post. Halushchenko is being investigated by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) as part of a large-scale corruption case into Energoatom involving Timur Mindich, a close associate of President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ex-Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov was financing a construction of high-end houses near Kyiv. After talking to Rubio at the G7 meeting in Canada, Sybiha praised Trump's "peace efforts and very effective energy sanctions against Russia." A separate branch of Ukraine's Armed Forces dedicated to unmanned systems was formed in 2024. The comments follow reporting by the Financial Times (FT) that British national security advisor Jonathan Powell tried to open a backchannel with Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov earlier this year. Ukraine's Special Operations Forces confirmed its "successful fire attack" on Stavrolen petrochemical enterprise, a Lukoil-owned petrochemical complex in Budyonnovsk, southern Russia, overnight on Nov. 12. Romania must take control over the local subsidiary of Russia's Lukoil to protect its national energy system and enforce international sanctions, Romanian Energy Minister Bogdan Ivan said on Nov. 12. Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi confirmed that Russian troops have managed to seize "three settlements" amid "fierce fighting" in the region. Purported videos posted on social media appear to show a large explosion and subsequent fire emanating from the Starobesheve power plant in the occupied community of Novyi Svit in Donetsk Oblast, following a projectile strike on the target.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A last-minute provision in the federal spending bill heavily restricting hemp-derived products such as CBD and THC drinks could lead some Republicans to vote against the spending bill which, if passed, could end the government shutdown as early as Wednesday. Jonathan Miller, an advocate for the hemp industry and former Kentucky state treasurer, said that “Kentucky is really ground zero for the rebirth of hemp” – a niche industry until the 2018 farm bill allowed a much wider variety of legal products. Miller said Congress has been batting around provisions to ban hemp for months. “First it was as part of the farm bill, and later was part of last year's spending bill,” Miller said. Senator Mitch McConnell and Congressman Andy Harris were instrumental in adding the provision, Miller said. 95% of hemp products have more than .4 milligrams,” Miller said. The 2018 farm bill's only restriction on hemp was that it contain less than 0.3% delta 9 THC. The new provision would ban THC in all forms, including delta 8 THC and THCA, which are common in hemp products, and would also criminalize non-intoxicating CBD products with trace amounts of THC, Miller said. There are 219 Republican House members, but Kentucky representatives James Comer, Thomas Massie and Andy Barr have all spoken out against the ban. Alcohol distributors, who also distribute THC beverages, wrote a letter calling for regulation rather than an outright ban, while the American Distilled Spirits Alliance supported the ban. Miller said that although distributors want to continue to profit from THC beverages, some alcohol manufacturers blame hemp for the recent decline in alcohol consumption among US adults. “If sweeping restrictions move forward, it won't be the bad actors who disappear,” said Jammie Treadwell, CEO of Treadwell Farms, a hemp manufacturer, adding “Instead, we need thoughtful, science-based regulation” “Policy made by omnibus surprise, rather than through open hearings, invites unintended harm and fuels the very unregulated, unsafe market lawmakers claim to oppose,” he said. The unregulated hemp market has led to problems with heavy metal, contaminants and under-age consumption. “The good news, though, is that this bill doesn't go into effect until a year after passage, so we have a year to try to fix this, and we're hopeful to replace the ban with some strong regulations of these products,” said Miller, who expects the bill to pass. Cameron Clarke, CEO of Kanha, which makes edibles for the regulated cannabis industry and the hemp market, said in the end, he expects politicians will have to cave to consumer demand for hemp products one way or another.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The House of Representatives will try to end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history on Wednesday, with a vote on a stopgap funding package to restart disrupted food assistance, pay hundreds of thousands of federal workers and revive a hobbled air-traffic control system. But President Donald Trump's support for the bill is expected to keep his party together in the face of vehement opposition from House Democrats, who are angry that a long standoff launched by their Senate colleagues failed to secure a deal to extend federal health insurance subsidies. U.S. Speaker Mike Johnson faces rebellious House as lawmakers return for shutdown vote House Democrats remain adamantly opposed, angered by the Senate deal that came less than a week after Democrats won high-profile elections in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City that many thought strengthened their odds of winning an extension of health insurance subsidies. “Donald Trump and Republicans believe the affordability crisis in America is made up. That's why these extremists haven't done a damn thing to lower the high cost of living. You deserve better,” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a social media posting on Wednesday. If approved by the House, the funding package would have to be signed into law by Trump, who heralded Senate passage as “a very big victory” on Tuesday. Johnson on Wednesday will swear in Democrat Adelita Grijalva, who won a September special election to fill the Arizona seat of her late father, Raul Grijalva. That means that after performing its constitutionally mandated duty of keeping the government funded, the House could once again be consumed by a probe into Trump's former friend whose life and 2019 death in prison have spawned countless conspiracy theories. The funding package also contains three full-year appropriations bills to fund military construction, agriculture programs including food assistance for lower-income Americans and legislative branch operations. It retroactively makes it illegal in most cases to obtain a senator's phone data without disclosure and allows those whose records were obtained to sue the Justice Department for US$500,000 in damages, along with attorneys' fees and other costs. The funding vote is expected late on Wednesday, and is likely to face some token Republican opposition, from Representative Thomas Massie, a Kentucky hardliner who opposed an initial House funding package in September along with fellow Representative Victoria Spartz of Indiana.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. Help us reach 25,000 members by the end of 2025. A large-scale assault by Russian troops in light vehicles on the city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast was "partially successful," the 7th Corps of Ukraine's Air Assault Forces reported on Nov. 12. During the defense of the city, Ukrainian forces destroyed five motorcycles and five cars on Nov. 11 and are working to eliminate firing positions the Russian army established in recent days in some neighborhoods of Pokrovsk, the report said. Russian troops are also attempting small-group infiltrations, sending two- to four-person teams to probe the southeastern outskirts of Myrnohrad daily. Delivering humanitarian aid to civilians in Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad has become impossible due to the threat of ongoing Russian attacks, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on Nov. 12. "It is impossible to reach the people who are there. It is impossible to deliver drinking water, humanitarian aid, or medicine," Filashkin said. Ukraine is facing increasingly intense Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure, while civilian casualties remain high, according to a U.N. monthly report published on Nov. 12. Three large-scale attacks on Oct. 10, 22, and 30 targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, triggering emergency power outages across most regions of the country, the report read. Russian attacks killed at least 148 civilians and injured another 929 in October. Russia has established the Unmanned Systems Forces, Russian state media reported on Nov. 12. "Operational regiments and other units have been formed," Sergey Ishtuganov, the deputy head of the new unit, said in an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda. "Combat work of the unmanned systems units is being carried out following a single plan and in cooperation with other units in battlegroups," he added. A separate branch of Ukraine's Armed Forces dedicated to unmanned systems was formed in 2024. Andrii Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation, said that Russia "copied (Ukraine's) successful approaches" as Ukraine's Armed Forces drone units are now operating "very effectively." The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has exposed an alleged Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) agent from Crimea who was planning a series of terrorist attacks in Kyiv, the agency said on Nov. 12. He searched for "like-minded people" to be recruited by the FSB, including Ukrainian citizens from the occupied territory who were not subject to mobilization in Ukraine due to their age. Kyiv City Prosecutor's Office reported on Nov. 12 that a 55-year-old resident of Crimea, the alleged organizer of terrorist attacks, has been charged in absentia. Ukrainian forces withdrew from its positions near the village of Rivnopillia in northeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast late on Nov. 11, Ukraine's Southern Defense Forces reported. In the Oleksandrivka and Huliaipole sectors, the Russian army continues mass strikes and has stepped up assault operations near the settlements of Pryvilne, Zelenyi Hai, Rivnopillia, Pavlivka, Vorone, Stepove, and Novopavlivske. "While attempting to advance, the enemy has suffered heavy losses. In the past day alone, 58 (Russian) personnel were killed and nearly three dozen wounded," the report read. Soldiers from the 28th Separate Mechanized Brigade have foiled a Russian attempt to break through toward the city of Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast, the brigade said on Nov. 12 on Telegram. The Russian army attempted to use foggy weather and low visibility to penetrate Kostiantynivka and its outskirts, deploying additional personnel for a potential breakthrough. Yet Ukrainian forces detected the movement in time and launched a counterattack. "Their equipment was also damaged, so there will be fewer vehicles to attack with next time." Three Russian Geran-2 drones struck the Holodnohirskyi district in central Kharkiv, injuring five people, on Nov. 12, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. The attack also damaged a civilian enterprise and nearby buildings, according to Syniehubov. Ukraine's Special Operations Forces confirmed its "successful fire attack" on the Stavrolen petrochemical enterprise, a Lukoil-owned petrochemical complex in Budyonnovsk, southern Russia, overnight on Nov. 12. "Numerous explosions and a fire were recorded in the target area. Supernova+, a well-known Ukrainian Telegram channel, posted video footage of the attack, saying that there were "at least three direct hits" on the Stavrolen petrochemical plant facilities. Russia is deploying additional forces near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast due to a shortage of reserves, the Atesh partisan group reported on Nov. 12. Russian military equipment and personnel are moving toward Pokrovsk on a daily basis, likely from the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia directions, according to the group. The newly arrived troops are reportedly being sent straight into assault operations, sometimes without even being formally registered with the regiment. At least two people have been killed and 13 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Nov. 12. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 90 out of the 121 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys launched by Russia overnight, according to the Air Force. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian drones attacked the Synelnykove district, killing a 47-year-old man, according to Governor Vladyslav Haivanenko. In Kharkiv Oblast, Russia targeted 11 settlements, injuring six people, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. In Kherson Oblast, Russian attacks injured five people over the past day, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian strikes injured two people in the city of Kostiantynivka, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. Russia has lost around 1,154,180 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Nov. 12. According to the report, Russia has also lost 23,556 (+3) armored fighting vehicles, 67,126 (+87) vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,379 (+13) artillery systems, 1,240 (+1) anti-aircraft systems1,540 (+1) multiple rocket launchers,  and 79,804 (+162) drones.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Trump penned a letter asking the Israeli president to grant a full pardon to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his ongoing corruption trial. In a letter distributed by the Israeli president's spokesperson, Trump wrote, “I hereby call on you to fully pardon Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a formidable and decisive War Time Prime Minister, and is now leading Israel into a time of peace.” He has entered a plea of not guilty and maintains his innocence. Neither Netanyahu nor any of his close associates have submitted such a petition. Trump has weighed in on Netanyahu's trial several times before. In June, after the 12-day war between Israel and Iran, he wrote a lengthy post on Truth Social in which he called Netanyahu's trial a “ridiculous witch hunt,” echoing language he's used about his own legal threats. And last month, during his short trip to Israel, Trump raised the issue of a pardon during his address to Israel's parliament. Trump's new letter sparked conflicting reactions across the Israeli political spectrum. Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir wrote on X: “President Herzog, listen to President Trump!”, he said, claiming that the “disgraceful” indictments against Netanyahu “have long since become an indictment against the prosecution itself.” Controversial death penalty and foreign media bills clear first reading in Israel's parliament Netanyahu's own testimony started in December 2024 but has been subject to repeated delays and cancellations, the majority of them at his request. It is not the first time Trump attempted to intervene in overseas ongoing judicial proceedings. In July, in a social media post, Trump urged Brazilian authorities to end their prosecution of another international ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, who has since been convicted of plotting a coup, saying Bolsonaro was “not guilty of anything, except having fought for people.” In April, he came out in support of French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, when she was barred from running for political office for five years after being found guilty of embezzling European Union funds. “The Witch Hunt against Marine Le Pen is another example of European Leftists using Lawfare to silence Free Speech, and censor their Political Opponent, this time going so far as to put that Opponent in prison,” he posted. “It is the same ‘playbook' that was used against me.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new hires include a husband-and-wife team of economists, Mark Duggan from Stanford University and Jacquelyn Pless from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as Canadian-born astrophysicist Sara Seager, also currently at MIT. The university plans to hire 100 postdoctoral fellows across a range of disciplines over two years, providing combined salary and research funding support of about $100,000 for each. The U of T initiative announced Wednesday will be funded by the university and is separate from funding packages announced in last week's federal budget. The Liberal government led by Prime Minister Mark Carney has pledged $1.7-billion to attract top international researchers over the next decade or more, with $1-billion earmarked for recruitment of senior researchers. Federal Budget 2025: Postsecondary schools cheer funds for talent, bemoan foreign student caps Hiring a cohort of talented, young scholars allows the university to get to know them and their work over an extended period at a relatively low cost, Prof. Barker said. The expectation is that some will eventually be hired as permanent faculty. “This gives us a span of time to work with people, see where the dust is settling globally and then position ourselves for that future,” Prof. Barker said. As Trump cuts university research, American scholars look north A faculty member at MIT since 2007, she has built her career trying to understand conditions on planets of other solar systems beyond our own and the potential for finding life on some of them. Under the current U.S. administration, NASA and the U.S. National Science Foundation are facing steep budget cuts, but Prof. Seager said her recent work is funded primarily through private money. The decision to come to Toronto was chiefly motivated by other factors including a strong offer of support for her program from U of T and the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics. He and Prof. Pless, an MIT economist, have been living at opposite ends of the continent. Although both said they are concerned with U.S. politics and the situation facing universities, they said it was not a core driver of their decision to come to Canada. “The way I see Toronto and Canada more broadly is that it's really a great place to study how innovation can solve major societal challenges like climate change,” she said. She and her husband will move to Toronto next summer. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last month, a former Chinese intelligence officer known as Eric publicly accused Chen Zhi, the Cambodian-Chinese tycoon behind the Prince Holding Group, of secretly collaborating with China's security apparatus. Posting on X, Eric, currently based in Australia, alleged that Chen maintained close ties with senior officials in the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) Ministry of State Security and Ministry of Public Security, and that his sprawling business conglomerate had become a covert instrument for the regime's global operations. “The Prince Group was not a target of China's anti-corruption campaign,” Eric said. He said that he witnessed Chinese officials from Beijing and Chongqing holding secret meetings at Chen's private club in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh. Eric said he also saw Chen pleading with his former superior, asking China's Public Security Ministry to “make concessions” on his behalf. Prosecutors said Chen led an international criminal enterprise operating under the guise of legitimate business. Behind its commercial facade, the Prince Group maintained multiple compounds in Cambodia where trafficked workers were held captive and forced to conduct online investment scams, according to Eric. Chen's rapid ascent in Cambodia was fueled by political patronage and connections to China. Soon afterward, he was appointed as an adviser to then Prime Minister Hun Sen, a position he has maintained under the current administration. Those positions provided both political cover and legitimacy for his alleged hidden activities, according to Eric. One of his London office buildings, worth nearly £100 million, has been frozen by the British authorities. In 2019, his associates purchased items worth over $3 million for a senior foreign official, the civil complaint stated. “In an authoritarian system,” Zhang said, “those who hold power must be held responsible for what happens under their jurisdiction. If convicted on all charges, Chen could face up to 40 years in prison.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. MUHIB RAHMAN is a Perry World House Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania. China Gains From New Delhi's Support for South Asian Autocrats They were furious about entrenched corruption and opposed recent attempts to clamp down on free speech and dissent through a social media blackout. Nepal, however, is only the latest example of a broader trend in South Asia. And in the Maldives, discontent over corruption, democratic backsliding, and polarizing foreign entanglements have led to similar protests demanding political change. New Delhi has treated democratic ideals and human rights as expendable whenever its own strategic interests are at stake. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter announced that the United States would defer to India in most matters to do with South Asia. Every U.S. administration since has echoed that policy of deference. New Delhi has propped up neighboring governments by bankrolling them, lobbying the West on their behalf, or deploying its security forces. In return, Washington has often stayed silent about any indiscretions it sees, retreating from the promotion of democracy when such an effort might clash with India's preferences. As a result, smaller countries in South Asia view India as a regional hegemon, empowered to manipulate domestic politics with U.S. approval. This resentment not only threatens India but also creates fertile ground for the spread of Chinese influence. As South Asian publics have pushed back against governments closely aligned with New Delhi, Beijing has asserted itself, courting new regimes with loans and military hardware and stressing respect for their sovereignty. South Asia's slide toward China has real consequences for Washington. Nowhere has the contradiction between India's ostensible democratic principles and its support for autocrats been more glaring than in Bangladesh. Hasina's government helped India meet critical security objectives—notably, dismantling networks of anti-Indian insurgents that operated out of Bangladesh—and in return, India bolstered Bangladesh's authoritarian security apparatus. New Delhi provided diplomatic protection to the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), an elite Bangladeshi counterterrorism force that targeted opposition politicians, activists, and journalists. According to a 2023 report from Human Rights Watch, millions of Bangladeshis faced political persecution during Hasina's tenure, including arrests, prosecution, and violence. Indian officials frequently defended the actions of her government, insisting that it was a pillar of regional stability and a bulwark against terrorism. But New Delhi remained notably silent on the subject of domestic repression. In early 2024, the India Out movement flared, with widespread protests, boycotts of Indian-made goods, and powerful social media campaigns. The Bangladeshi government's brutal suppression of a student-led uprising in mid-2024, which according to the UN resulted in as many as 1,400 deaths, intensified public outrage. These demonstrations snowballed into mass protests that encouraged the country's military to abandon Hasina and toppled her government, forcing her to flee. Her exile in India exacerbated tensions with the interim government in Bangladesh, which has since held New Delhi at arm's length. U.S. officials expressed concerns about irregularities in the 2014 and 2018 Bangladeshi elections but took little concrete action, yielding to India in its backing of Hasina. Still, the U.S. administration tempered its public criticism and held back broader penalties. Wary of straining ties with India, it acknowledged that Bangladesh's 2024 elections were “not free or fair” but avoided any stronger reproach. Bangladeshi civil society welcomed rhetorical support for its democracy but was demoralized by Washington's reluctance to act decisively. In October 2024, Chinese warships visited Chittagong—the first foreign naval vessels to do so after the establishment of the interim Bangladeshi government—signaling a major geopolitical shift. Significant diplomatic and military visits followed, as well as Chinese support for Bangladesh's involvement in naval exercises with Pakistan (a longtime Indian rival), Chinese defense technology transfers, and Chinese investment in infrastructure and economic zones. This was a decisive turn away from Hasina's India-first posture and toward closer alignment with Beijing. A similar process unfolded in the Maldives, an archipelago country where domestic discontent over Indian influence led to a change in government and, subsequently, greater Chinese involvement. The outcome offered further evidence that prioritizing short-term stability over democratic values and accountable governance can invite long-term reversals, a trend that Washington and New Delhi would do well to reckon with. After Abdulla Yameen became president of the Maldives in 2013, India treated him as an important ally, prioritizing military and surveillance cooperation with the government in Male even as Yameen became more authoritarian. By 2016, New Delhi had deepened its defense ties with Yameen's government, hosting him with high honors and signing agreements that made India the Maldives' primary security partner. Meanwhile, Yameen dismantled democratic institutions, jailing opposition leaders (including former President Mohamed Nasheed), manipulating the judiciary, and declaring states of emergency in 2015 and 2018 that allowed him to concentrate his power and silence dissent. For many Maldivians, this was tantamount to India tacitly approving of repression. The Maldives' own India Out campaign—paradoxically led by Yameen after his electoral defeat to the pro-Indian politician Ibrahim Mohamed Solih—gained traction, casting India as a neoimperial power. Framing his win as a reclamation of sovereignty, Muizzu expelled Indian troops and canceled defense agreements with New Delhi, abruptly ending decades of security cooperation between the two countries. A visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Male in July 2025 (his first since Muizzu took office) eased tensions somewhat, with the two leaders launching trade talks and opening a $565 million credit line for the Maldives in a shift toward a renewed economic partnership. Washington delegated diplomatic responsibility for the Maldives to India, issuing no sanctions in response to democratic backsliding and refraining from penalizing Yameen as he undermined democratic institutions. In response, the Biden administration's secretary of state, Antony Blinken, attempted diplomatic damage control, hosting Maldivian Foreign Minister Moosa Zameer in Washington in June 2024 and extending offers of U.S. security and naval cooperation. Still, the gesture paled in comparison with what China offered: military assistance in the form of grants, hardware, and training, as well as a free trade agreement that included major infrastructure projects. The perception of Western indifference had hardened among Maldivians, who saw the U.S. overtures as reactions to Chinese regional influence rather than genuine efforts to support autonomy, democracy, and human rights in their country. Without convincing support for political transparency, democratic institutions, and a free civil society, U.S. attempts to engage the Maldives appeared to be mere geopolitical scheming. The arc of discontent evident in Bangladesh and the Maldives, where Indian meddling has produced Chinese gains, is also visible in Sri Lanka. At a special session of the UN Human Rights Council that year, India voted in favor of a resolution praising Sri Lanka's victory and seeking to block Western calls for an investigation into alleged war crimes. New Delhi continued to deflect international pressure from Sri Lanka in the years that followed, shielding Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa from meaningful global scrutiny and allowing him to consolidate power while dismissing Tamil grievances as Western propaganda. New Delhi's calculated leniency sent a clear signal: if the Sri Lankan government stayed aligned with India on regional security, India would not press it on past atrocities or its persecution of minorities. India became Sri Lanka's de facto lender of last resort without requiring the Sri Lankan government to address concerns about the human rights abuses, militarization, or corruption that fueled the country's political crisis. Protesters stormed the palace in July 2022, forcing Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee. Rajapaksa's successor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, turned to China for support. Beijing responded with alacrity, granting a two-year moratorium on debt repayments and, with the approval of the Sri Lankan government, advancing a $4.5 billion oil refinery project in Hambantota, one of the largest foreign investments in Sri Lanka's history. Once operational, the refinery will anchor a Chinese logistics hub just 180 miles from India's coast. While Washington supported UN efforts to investigate wartime human rights abuses and provided humanitarian aid to Sri Lanka during the economic crisis in 2022, it did not press for the establishment of governance benchmarks or anticorruption safeguards from the Sri Lankan government, either through Indian cooperation or otherwise. U.S. officials praised India's financial lending but stayed quiet about the lack of accountability. Many Sri Lankans, especially the young protesters, viewed both New Delhi and Washington as responsible for the persistence of a corrupt old regime. Like its South Asian peers, Nepal has watched for decades as India prioritized its regional influence over promoting local democracy, a policy that has exacerbated political upheavals in a country that has seen 14 different governments in the last 17 years. Although much of the country's instability is rooted in its internal fractiousness and troubled transition from monarchy to republican democracy, many Nepalis believe India's meddling has deepened their endemic political crisis. New Delhi, for instance, imposed a blockade from late 2015 to early 2016 to punish Kathmandu for a constitutional change that affected Indian communities on the Nepali side of the border. In 2025, protesters were not just rejecting oligarchic rot, but also reaffirming their long-standing frustration over India's role in sustaining it. Washington has long seen Nepal as merely part of India's backyard, and therefore limits its involvement to aid projects and disaster relief while avoiding deeper diplomatic initiatives that might irk New Delhi. To many Nepalis, however, the compact looked like a plan hatched in New Delhi to cement both Indian and U.S. authority in South Asia. Opponents of the agreement rallied outside the Parliament building in February 2022 and burned both American and Indian flags in protest. In 2017, Nepal joined the Belt and Road Initiative, China's vast infrastructure investment program. Chinese trade with Nepal is growing quickly, and Beijing touts the no-strings loans it has extended to Kathmandu. Thus far, the interim government has signaled that it will maintain this China-friendly orientation while cautiously advancing domestic calls for accountability and autonomy. Across South Asia, the pattern is clear: India prioritizes its narrow strategic interests over upholding democratic and liberal values. Washington, wary of straining its ties with New Delhi, looks the other way. These are not isolated outcomes, but structural ones. And as long as Washington continues to adopt a regional policy that defers to—and unthinkingly endorses—Indian preferences, it risks ceding South Asia to Beijing. The remedy is not for Washington to micromanage India's neighborhood policy but to forge a shared democratic baseline for cooperation. If the world's two largest democracies cannot reconcile their geopolitical strategies with the democratic values they claim to share, China will continue to make strategic gains amid the wreckage that Indian and U.S. policies produce. The U.S.-Indian partnership has been shaken in Trump's second term, with Washington slapping high tariffs on New Delhi ostensibly because of the latter's purchases of oil from Moscow. If Washington does not want to see Chinese influence expand irrevocably in the region, it must stop deferring to India. Instead, it should take seriously the democratic aspirations of all South Asian states and remember that their citizens will not countenance repression and bad governance—especially when it is sponsored by the world's largest democracy.
