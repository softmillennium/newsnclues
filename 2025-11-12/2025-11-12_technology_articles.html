                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a surprise Wednesday drop, Bellevue, Wash.-based Valve Software unveiled three new physical gaming devices intended to work with its digital storefront Steam. “We've been super happy with the success of Steam Deck, and PC gamers have continued asking for even more ways to play all the great titles in their Steam libraries,” Gabe Newell, president of Valve, said in a press release. It's intended to quietly and efficiently run games from your Steam library, with a removable front panel for decorative purposes and an LED so users can readily tell when it's on or off. The Steam Frame is a standalone virtual reality headset that's reportedly able to stream any game from users' Steam library, with full controller input. It's a PC in its own right, so it can be used by itself, rather than having to be hooked up to a desktop. Announcing: New @steampowered.com Hardware, coming in 2026:Steam ControllerSteam MachineSteam Frame. Valve's announcement on Wednesday came roughly 10 minutes after a series of rumors and leaks that went viral in the PC gaming community, apparently spurred by an accidental release by one of Valve's partner companies. This is a full-circle move for Valve, which had previously attempted to break into both the controller and living room markets with similar devices. Valve still sells its high-end Valve Index VR system, which first came out in 2019, though it's out of stock at time of writing. Newell has been vocal for years about how he believes Windows is a poor environment for computer games, and Valve has made a number of moves in recent memory that all come back to trying to expand Linux's presence in the scene. Through that lens, the new 2026 Steam Machine in particular seems like another quiet shot across Microsoft's bow. AWS re:Invent connects you with global leaders, builders, and innovators.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft says it has linked massive data centers in Wisconsin and Atlanta — roughly 700 miles and five states apart — through a high-speed fiber-optic network to operate as a unified system. The facilities are designed to train and run advanced AI models across connected sites — a setup that Microsoft describes as the world's first “planet-scale AI superfactory.” Unlike traditional cloud data centers that run millions of separate applications for different customers, Microsoft says the new facilities are designed to handle single, massive AI workloads across multiple sites. Each data center houses hundreds of thousands of Nvidia GPUs connected through a high-speed architecture known as an AI Wide Area Network, or AI-WAN, to share computing tasks in real time. This unified supercomputer will train and run the next generation of AI models for key partners such as OpenAI, and for Microsoft's own internal models. Microsoft spent more than $34 billion on capital expenditures in its most recent quarter — much of it on data centers and GPUs — to keep up with what it sees as soaring AI demand. Some analysts and investors see echoes of a tech bubble in the rush to build AI infrastructure, if business customers don't realize enough value from AI in the near term. Microsoft, Amazon and others say the demand is real, not speculative, pointing to long-term contracts as evidence. Story corrected at 11:30 a.m. PT to accurately reflect Microsoft's announcements about which companies will have AI models trained in the facilities. University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines. Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Huawei accelerators gain traction as Chinese cloud giants retrain away from Nvidia silicon. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Restrictions on U.S. chip exports are beginning to force visible shifts in China's AI compute strategy, as a shortage of Nvidia accelerators drives cloud providers toward domestic alternatives. According to new reporting by The Wall Street Journal, supply has become tight enough that government officials are now overseeing allocation of remaining high-end parts, prioritizing homegrown options like Huawei's Ascend series for training and inference workloads. The impact is reportedly most visible in China's public cloud and state-funded data center projects, which are now formally barred from using foreign AI chips. Chinese developers are rewriting code and restructuring workloads to run on domestic accelerators like Huawei's Ascend 910B and 910C, as a result, which are less powerful than Nvidia's latest GPUs. Multiple Chinese developers are thought to already be using it for model training, making it the first domestic chip deployed at this scale for large-scale AI. Alibaba and Baidu, two of China's largest cloud providers, have begun shifting workloads to their in-house AI silicon as well. Baidu recently revealed a new version of its Baige training platform that runs entirely on Chinese-made hardware and software, designed to keep its product road map moving without access to the latest Nvidia parts. Some Chinese companies have routed training runs through overseas subsidiaries, while others are relying on second-hand or refurbished Nvidia accelerators that predate the latest U.S. rules or procuring chips through grey-market brokers. With Chinese developers pushing into less mature hardware ecosystems, memory bandwidth is becoming a key constraint. As we reported in September, Chinese memory firms like YMTC and CXMT are exploring HBM production to support domestic accelerators, but no large-scale supply has materialized.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Valve doubles down on headset gaming, but it isn't all about VR. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Not quite four years on from the industry-bending success of the Steam Deck, Valve is back with its most ambitious collection of gaming hardware yet. Today, the pioneering PC gaming company is taking the wraps off the Arm-powered wireless Steam Frame gaming headset, a new Steam Controller that takes its design cues from the Steam Deck, and something I never would have guessed, given its past failures: a new compact, cube-shaped Steam Machine gaming desktop, rocking some more semi-custom AMD silicon. Valve invited us to its headquarters for some early hands-on time with all this new hardware, and I came away mostly impressed. These are big swings for a company that has a tiny number of employees compared to competitors like Epic Games or Microsoft. Its controller and Linux-powered gaming desktop have a good shot at success if the price is right (Valve isn't talking pricing on any of its new hardware yet). For those more interested in traditional PC gaming, we're breaking the cube-shaped Steam Machine and new Steam Controller out into its own story [here]. We'll have to see how well that trick works once we get review hardware, but it sounds like a great way to get gamers to further buy into your hardware ecosystem and your game store. Aside from, perhaps, Valve's own Half-Life Alyx, compelling, high-production AAA VR games haven't materialized, despite a decade of hardware pushes from Valve, HTC, and most notably Meta. The Steam Frame (and its controllers) are designed to play VR titles, as well as traditional PC and mobile games in a resizable in-headset window that actually felt like a big-screen experience during my hands-on time with the headset. Valve engineers told me the company thinks of the Steam Frame less as a VR headset and more as “a new way to play your entire Steam library.” The Frame can do this both by streaming titles wirelessly from your PC, or running them internally on its built-in Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. That headset, released in 2019, was purely for VR gaming, used base stations for tracking, and required attaching to a computer to play. With the Steam Frame, streaming from a PC is one option, but the company has a new “Fex” (Valve stylizes it as FEX) software emulation layer that brings SteamOS to the Arm instruction set, which certainly has implications beyond this device. But I'm very curious how much running Windows titles via Proton and Fex is going to affect battery life and performance. USB Type-A Wi-Fi 6E with dual-band low-latency direct PC connection This is a major difference from Valve's previous VR controllers for its Index headset, which each included an A button, B button, thumb stick, gyroscope, and advanced finger tracking. In short demos, this seemed to work fine, but I am not sure I'd want to play something like a platformer or other gamepad-focused title for long periods with a separated D-pad and button setup. Comfort of a headset is going to vary between individuals, and I didn't spend hours using the Steam Frame, so I'm not ready to fully pass judgment yet. But the headset was fairly easy to put on and adjust the IPD (via a knob between the lenses), it never felt heavy in my demos, and I didn't experience nearly as much lens fogging as I have with previous VR headsets. Like so many other aspects of the Steam Frame, the fit feels good at first blush, but I'd need to spend a lot more time with it on my head to tell just how good it is. That dongle uses the 6GHz band for game streaming, while the 5GHz band handles Wi-Fi communication duties, like downloads and multiplayer communication, and chat. Foveated rendering — essentially saving compute resources by using eye tracking to render only the center of what you are looking at in the greatest detail — has been a staple of VR for nearly a decade now. But with the Steam Frame, Valve is taking that concept and applying it to game streaming, calling it Foveated Streaming, and pointing out that this isn't something developers need to get involved with. In my brief time playing Half-Life: Alyx on the Steam Frame at Valve's headquarters, performance was flawless, and the controllers were intuitive. But, of course, we need to spend more time with the headset in settings that aren't Valve's HQ to pass judgment on how well the Steam Frame is at streaming titles from a PC. And the game ran just fine and looked good at what Valve reps told me was 1400p in a window inside the headset, which I could actually resize to something that filled a large part of my field of view. “The magic trick is that the game doesn't know it's running on an Arm chip,” designer Lawrence Yang told me. That happens thanks to Valve's Fex, which is an emulation layer, so that will almost certainly mean increased power consumption / shorter battery life. Valve isn't saying anything about battery life yet (except for the 40-hour per AA controller claim), as they continue to work on the software for now. But like the Steam Deck, this means your gaming time on the Steam Frame is going to vary dramatically, depending on whether you're streaming from a PC or playing something directly on the device. You can see the fan, heatpipe, and other internals in this clear version that Valve had made solely to show off the internal layout. This level of fan noise wouldn't be problematic for me when playing an action title or something with steady music, but it did slightly spoil the immersion in this one game. This was good for listening to Valve's engineers while I ran through demos, and sound generally felt fine when gaming, it's not the kind of isolating audio that you might want to be truly immersed in your game world. Valve's software developer, Jeremy Selan, tried to assuage some of my fears about what Fex might do to battery life, saying the device uses Vulkan, that many games now are natively Vulkan, and that as soon as the game engine makes API calls, they start running in on “natively compiled Arm processing code.” Similarly, on the CPU side, Selan says it's mostly things like the user interactions themselves (what happens when you pull a trigger or hit a jump button) that go through the Fex layer. He says there is about a 10-20% performance hit with the emulation, but that it only applies to specific aspects of the code. “But on games like Hades 2, where we are seeing 1440p at 90 Hz, while running the full VR stack. The company's goal is for the Steam Frame experience to be as frictionless as possible, so that people can focus on playing their Steam titles. But obviously there needs to be some distinction between games that you'll need to be near your gaming PC to play, and games you've installed natively and can play while you're at home or traveling with your headset. This should further reduce the overhead of Valve's Fex emulation layer, but it's not shipping yet. Again, I'm quite curious to see how the promised “new way to play your entire Steam library” holds up when we get review units – as well as what battery life is like. Obviously, I don't expect the Steam Frame with a smartphone chip to run games like a dedicated gaming rig, but Borderlands 4 is a recent addition to my Steam library, and it can bring my RTX 4090 to its knees. “From the partner's perspective, we're trying to minimize the effort to get their software on this device,” said Selan, wrapping up my Steam Frame session.”And from a customer's perspective, they shouldn't have to think about anything. ”We'll learn more about how smooth the streaming and native experience is, as well as battery life and how much the Steam Frame costs, as we get closer to launch, which Valve representatives said should be early next year.

Now, the company is taking its learnings from that device and bringing them to your living room in a new gaming PC, the Steam Machine. Tom's Hardware visited Valve's offices in Bellevue, Washington to talk to the developers behind this new PC and get an early look at the hardware. This is a system meant for living room play, armed with a new semi-custom AMD Zen 4 CPU and AMD RDNA 3 GPU, and it runs SteamOS just like the Steam Deck. In many ways, it's effectively a Steam-based console. Valve claims that this system is six times more powerful than the Steam Deck, though, so it should be a better couch experience than using the Steam Deck Dock and playing games at low resolution. The front of the system features a customizable light bar that you can personalize to indicate system status, such as when it is booting up, downloading games, or updating. Wi-Fi 6E, dedicated Bluetooth antennae, integrated 2.4 GHz Steam Controller radio With the top and sides removed, the Steam Machine looks similar to a denser version of Noctua's NH-P1 air cooler, with similar dimensions and denser fins, and a couple of heatpipes poking out of the edges. The default is black, but Valve reps said the company will be releasing files for people with 3D printers to come up with their own designs. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. There was also an e-ink front that displayed system stats in real-time, but it wasn't working when we were in the demo room. So if you want something other than basic black, be prepared to make your own. The Steam Machine's CPU is based on 6 AMD Zen 4 cores, runs up to 4.8 GHz, and has a 30W TDP. Valve did explore a separate add-in board GPU at one point, but we were told that "the compromises that we have to make on size and thermals and cost didn't really pan out." Technically, you can upgrade it, but with some RF shielding and an attempt to keep the memory as close as possible to the CPU for signal integrity, it might be a bit of work. Valve says the GPU uses 110W (though one Valve rep gave a range of 110W - 130W, stating that "we're still kind of fine-tuning that") while the CPU goes up to 30 watts. Either way, Valve is using an M.2 2230 SSD in the system, though there is room to support an M.2 2280 if you decide to upgrade or replace the drive. Just like on the Steam Deck, you can use a microSD card. If you remove the microSD card and place it in a Steam Deck or a Stream Frame, your library will come with you, ready to go in other devices. "For most people, you never have to be seeing [the SSD] at all," said Valve hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat. "[An] SD card is your best way to expand your storage, but if you really want to, you can. In addition, there are distinct Wi-Fi and Bluetooth antennas to help prevent signal issues. If you're using Valve's new Steam Controller, a connection puck is built into the device, allowing for up to four Steam Controllers with no loss in Bluetooth performance. (You are, of course, welcome to connect a mouse and keyboard or use other controllers). If you add a DisplayPort hub to the rear or use daisy-chaining, the system should be able to support more monitors. While Valve says the HDMI port supports 4K at 60 Hz, it's labeled as HDMI 2.0, not HDMI 2.1, because it doesn't currently use some software features of HDMI 2.1, such as like DSC and ALLM, which Valve says "we are currently working on and hope to rectify in the future." If you use Steam Link, iOS and Android devices should work, too. The controller features two joysticks, ABXY buttons, and a D-Pad in a layout similar to PlayStation's DualSense controller, in that the joysticks are parallel. The extra buttons, including Steam, menu, view, and quick access menu buttons, are also there, along with two trackpads for haptic feedback. The touchpads are on a slight angle up — it's not drastic — and are tilted slightly sideways to address the way your thumbs meet to move them. "They're clocked and canted, and that is just because based on a ton of experimentation, and probably 30 different orientations of these trackpads, we found that this angle is the most comfortable for the most users when they're playing," Valve's Steve Cardinali said. Valve also said that because these joysticks are so responsive, it could reduce the deadzone on the controllers by more than half. There are also standard L/R triggers and L/R bumpers, along with four assignable grip buttons, just like on the Steam Deck. There's a 6-axis gyroscope and what Valve calls "Capacitive grip sense," which means the controller can tell that you're holding it. You can connect the Steam Controller to devices in three different ways. (If you're using a Steam Machine, there's an internal puck inside). The Puck, which plugs into a USB port, uses a proprietary wireless connection that Valve claims is more stable than Bluetooth, and can connect to four controllers. There are pogo pins on the puck that you can connect to the Controller in order to charge it when you're not playing games. You can also charge the device over USB. Valve estimates that you'll get 35 hours or more of playtime on the Steam Controller's rechargeable battery. Tom's Hardware Managing editor Matt Safford said that the controller felt comfortable in his brief demo time, though he spent more time cycling through the various modes than settling on a specific one. More time, he said, will tell how he feels about the touchpads, given his muscle memory and proclivity for the FPS genre is based on a keyboard and mouse. The controller didn't feel overly bulky, nor heavy or light. Valve hasn't provided pricing or an exact release date for the Steam Machine or Steam Controller just yet, though we were told to expect the hardware early next year. "The market is kind of weird right now," a Valve rep told us. "You know, memory prices are going up like right as we speak. Right now, depending on who you ask, they might tell you the GDDR we're using is not a thing next year, right? So, like, there's a lot of things that we're still trying to figure it out. But, uh, of course, our goal is to be ready, and we think we're doing a pretty good job of that.” That being said, we were told that the company is aiming for a "great value" on "the entry level side of things." But we won't find out pricing until closer to launch. The Steam Machine moniker does come with some baggage. At the time, SteamOS only ran games that worked natively on Linux. And the Steam Machines, which were made by companies like Alienware, Zotac, and Origin, didn't perform as well as Windows-based competitors with similar hardware. While some praised it for its flexibility across game genres, the controller eventually went on a firesale in 2019, with Valve selling them at $5 a pop to clear inventory. Valve's hardware developers told us they've learned from the original Steam Machines, and that they don't want game developers to have to do work to get their games working for the device unless it's additive to take advantage of SteamOS or Steam Machine features. With newer hardware, better game compatibility, and the Steam Deck as a strong proof of concept, it sure seems from a brief hands-on that the Steam Machine has a better chance this time around.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Founded earlier this year, BluePill helps marketers test ideas, products, and ads in minutes using artificial intelligence instead of traditional focus groups. BluePill builds a custom AI consumer audience for each brand using real-world data — such as social conversations, surveys, and customer inputs — modeled after a brand's target segment. Clients log into the platform, upload a new concept, campaign, or packaging design, and receive instant feedback predicting how their audience would respond — essentially running a massive, simulated focus group. moms” or “Gen Z snack buyers”) that brands can directly query for insights without building custom models. BluePill says its simulated audiences achieve 93% accuracy compared to human panels. “Our edge is validated, accurate insights — and the fact that we deliver these in minutes for a fraction of the cost makes it a no-brainer,”  said BluePill founder and CEO Ankit Dhawan. BluePill is taking on larger marketing research companies such as Ipsos, Qualtrics, and Nielsen. Dhawan said incumbents “rely on slow, costly human panels, while newer startups mostly have large language models role-play as consumers.” Dhawan was an entrepreneur-in-residence at the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) and co-founded virtual experience startup Virtuelly. He also spent more than four years at Amazon as a product leader working on AI products. Other team members at BluePill include Puneet Bajaj and Andy Zhu.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crafting a perfect prompt for AI chatbots is often a challenge —  so much so that startups are creating roles for prompt engineers. Consumer-facing AI apps are increasingly adding features like suggestion buttons or autogenerated recommendations to nudge customers to use the chatbot more frequently and show them about what the app can do. Hero, a productivity startup founded by former Meta employees, announced a new autocompletion SDK today that will fill in prompts for you based on context. The SDK is currently invite-only and will let developers integrate this tech into their apps. This is also useful when you are using an AI-powered image or a video generator, where autocomplete can help you with different parameters like object, style, location, landscape, and camera angle. Notably, Adobe's new feature for creating soundtracks with its Firefly app lets user enter keywords in different sections of a prompt, such as mood, style, and purpose, to easily create a tune. Hero engineer Saharsh Vedi, who worked on this feature, said that usually you usually need a lot of back-and-forth with an AI app to get the results you want. The startup's co-founder, Brad Kowalk, told TechCrunch that the company is using a series of models to predict what you might type into a prompt next. “With AI autocomplete, we pull forward all the inputs needed to complete an action, finishing it 10 times faster as there are fewer back-and-forths involved. He added that because there are fewer messages involved, companies operating at scale can save on server costs. Kowalk said that he and his co-founder, Seung W. Lee, thought of building the tech based on their experience working on AR features at Meta. On AR glasses, there are constraints on screen size, so the interface for prompts needs to be simple — like adding parameters to a query. The feature will be released to users in a couple of months. The company is also in talks with Koah Labs, an ad tech startup, to build AI-powered ads where brands can show up in autocomplete suggestions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blue Origin has again postponed the second launch of its New Glenn megarocket. Last night, the arrival of two coronal mass ejections—huge eruptions of plasma and magnetic field from the Sun's surface—triggered dazzling auroras as far south as Alabama. NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) issued a G4—or “severe”—geomagnetic storm watch through Wednesday, as another larger CME is expected to reach Earth around midday. New Glenn was set to lift off no earlier than 2:50 p.m. It's worth noting that the Federal Aviation Administration recently issued a ground stop on daytime commercial space launches during the government shutdown, but Blue Origin received an exemption for this launch. The statement did not specify a new launch date. However, due to highly elevated solar activity and its potential effects on the ESCAPADE spacecraft, NASA is postponing launch until space weather conditions improve. We are currently assessing opportunities to establish our next launch… Geomagnetic storms are major disturbances in Earth's magnetosphere that typically occur when the Sun blasts a CME toward our planet. These disturbances can increase the likelihood of aurora at latitudes farther south. They can also disrupt power systems, radio communications, and spacecraft operations. According to the SWPC, Wednesday's geomagnetic storm could impact some critical infrastructure, “but mitigation is possible.” Had Blue Origin moved forward with the launch, solar weather could have messed with the communications and navigation systems that New Glenn relies on. Geomagnetic storms also heat the upper atmosphere, which can increase drag and alter ascent conditions. Both Blue Origin and NASA have a lot riding on this launch, so New Glenn won't get off the ground until conditions are just right. This is only the second test flight for Blue Origin's megarocket. ESCAPADE (the Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers mission) will use two identical spacecraft to investigate how solar wind interacts with Mars' magnetic environment and how this drives the planet's atmospheric escape, according to NASA. New Glenn's success would make it a strong competitor for both NASA science missions and national security contracts. Wasn't Trump just calling Jared Isaacman a blue-blooded Democrat? Both NASA and Blue Origin have a lot riding on this flight. Jared Isaacman's radical plans for NASA have suddenly come to light, and sources allege that Acting Administrator Sean Duffy may be behind the leak. Experts warn that the Starship Human Landing System may be years behind schedule, but SpaceX says it has a new plan to save its Artemis 3 contract. X-59 is designed to usher in a new era of air travel with its quiet supersonic technology. NASA is eyeing alternative options for its Artemis 3 lunar lander, and it looks like Blue Origin has a shot at securing the contract.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>iPhone and Apple Watch owners in the United States will now be able to carry a copy of their U.S. passport on their device, which they can then use at TSA checkpoints across more than 250 U.S. airports when traveling domestically. Users will also have to take a selfie for verification and then complete a series of facial and head movements for additional security. Support for IDs in Apple Wallet is the last obstacle standing in the way of making iPhones a replacement for a physical wallet, as it can now hold payment cards, loyalty cards, tickets and passes, and more. The iPhone or Apple Watch should be held near an identity reader, and users will use Face ID or Touch ID to authenticate their information. Users will also be able to see what identity information is being requested before completing the verification process. (The TSA website offers a list of which states are currently supporting mobile ID, but still advises travelers to carry their physical ID.) Apple says that users will eventually be able to present their Digital ID at businesses and organizations where they need to verify their age, both in-person and online. This could include event venues or bars, where users need to present their ID at the door to verify if they're of drinking age. For instance, if a user wanted to order alcohol for delivery through a service like Uber Eats, they could verify their ID during the ordering process. In both cases, users would be able to confirm that their age is over 21 without having to also share personal information like their name, address or birthday. Plus, users don't have to unlock their phone or hand it over to present their ID, as it works just like Apple Pay.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WisdomAI, the new AI data analytics startup from Rubrik co-founder Soham Mazumdar, has landed a fresh $50 million Series A led by Kleiner Perkins with participation from new investor NVentures (Nvidia's venture capital arm). A business user simply asks questions in natural language, such as, “How many customers do I have in my pipeline and what's preventing them from closing this quarter?” So if the LLM hallucinates, it will simply write an ineffective query rather than inventing false answers. WisdomAI has written its own logic that it calls the “enterprise context layer,” which studies the customer data to understand it. All of the startup's co-founders worked with Mazumdar at data security company Rubrik, giving them deep experience with enterprise storage warehouses. WisdomAI counts such companies like Descope, ConocoPhillips, Cisco, and Patreon as customers. Mazumdar said the young company is also growing usage within its enterprise customers. Another customer started with 10 seats and expanded to 450, which is almost everyone in the company, he said. “I have created an agent which is watching our product usage metrics, our ticket information,” Mazumdar says, adding that it took him about five minutes to create it. But rather than sending him a daily or, even, hourly report on usage and helpdesk tickets, it alerts him “when something interesting happens,” he describes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Google's self-driving car project began testing in the Bay Area back in 2009, its engineers focused on highways by sending its sensor-laden vehicles cruising down Interstate 280, which runs the length of Silicon Valley's peninsula. On Tuesday, the project, now an Alphabet subsidiary we all know as Waymo, announced that its robotaxi service would now drive on freeways in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and Phoenix. The new service marks another technical leap for Waymo, whose robotaxis currently serve five US metros: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area. The company says it will launch in several other US and international cities next year, including Dallas, Miami, Nashville, Las Vegas, Detroit, and London. Waymo also announced Wednesday that it would begin curbside pickup and drop-off service at San Jose Mineta International Airport, allowing passengers to, theoretically, travel autonomously all the way from San Francisco to San Jose—a service area of some 260 square miles. Waymo has been offering its autonomous taxi service on area service roads since the summer of 2023, but the new freeway service could cut in half the time it takes for a robotaxi to travel from San Francisco to Mountain View, Waymo user experience researcher Naomi Guthrie says. “Freeway driving is one of those things that's very easy to learn, but very hard to master,” Waymo co-CEO Dmitri Dolgov told reporters last week. But Waymo executives said that, despite a year of employee- and guest-only highway testing, safety emergencies on highways are relatively rare, so the team was unable to collect as much real-world data as it needed to train its vehicles to operate safely there. Two onboard computers help create system “redundancies,” meaning the vehicles will have computer backup if something goes wrong. Waymo execs also say they have and will work with law enforcement and first responders, including highway patrols, to create procedures for vehicles and riders stranded on highway shoulders, where hundreds of Americans are killed every year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meanwhile, 92-year old Cockney legend Michael Caine is being inducted into ElevenLabs' rather chillingly named “Iconic Marketplace.” McConaughey will be “investing an undisclosed sum” in the company, and adding its product to one of his steady creative workflows. Gizmodo asked ElevenLabs for McConaughey's ownership percentage, and will update if we hear back. What McConaughey is literally doing is, well, having someone add ElevenLabs' tech to his newsletter-podcast-YouTube thingy called “Lyrics Of Livin' with McConaughey.” It's a weekly newsletter of thoughts and stories from McConaughey-land that he also narrates. Judging from the audio quality and mic work, it sounds like McConaughey (quite charmingly) records the English-language audio track himself on home equipment before an animation pass is added and the product is uploaded to YouTube and emailed out. “Now, thanks to ElevenLabs, Lyrics of Livin' is expanding with a Spanish language edition, allowing us to reach and connect with even more people,” McConaughey said in his statement. ElevenLabs describes what it's offering in the following terms: “License AI voices and IP of history's most iconic figures for your creative projects. Request licensing for entertainment legends, sports heroes, musical pioneers, and transformative historical figures. Our marketplace connects creators with rights holders for the most iconic IP.” But there's simply no refuting ElevenLabs' choice of word: Michael Caine's voice is iconic. And you can now license a digitized version of it for your “projects and content” through ElevenLabs for the low low price of, well, the price isn't provided until you tell ElevenLabs what the project is. But one can only assume it's much less than the cost of having the actual man vibrate his tremulous vocal cords for you.

A friend of mine got evicted illegally from the homeless shelter and got a moderately sized settlement which was a challenge for him to receive because he made it to his 50s without ever getting a bank account.He started getting scam texts from someone who kept needing money to get a bus ticket to visit him and one time claimed to be at the local airport needing money for a cab ride.  One of our friends convinced him to take a cab to the airport himself to meet this "person" who wasn't there.We were thinking that they might have targeted him based on public records but I can say in the last few months I've met five people who are think are scammers sending me DMs on the like of Mastodon, Bluesky and Tumblr.

I guess this is a first step toward some larger legal goal? It's not even clear if “Lighthouse” is the name of an overseas company or just the name of the service.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Unlike the days of broadcast TV, there's no centralized way of tracking and comparing what's grabbing the most eyeballs in any given week. Think Squid Game or KPop Demon Hunters—or Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein. So only a couple of days of that included Frankenstein, but that was still enough for the movie to pull in over 29 million views, for nearly 74 million hours watched of Oscar Isaac's mad-sciencing and Jacob Elordi's monster-emoting. “Seeing people embracing Frankenstein in the way I have for over 50 years now is really meaningful,” del Toro said in a statement provided to Deadline. “I've seen an outpouring of love, with many sharing with me about their repeat viewing, both in the 600 sold-out screenings and now globally on Netflix. This is a film I've carried with me my entire life, and to see it resonate so deeply with audiences around the world is a really full circle moment.” Whether Frankenstein can keep its spot on top remains to be seen, but it'll have a tough time catching up to KPop Demon Hunters‘ massive view count. Earlier this year the animated musical became Netflix's most-watched film release and still racked up over 12 million views this past week, which happens to be its 21st week in the streamer's top 10. Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what's next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who. If you can't get enough 'Squid Game' or 'Stranger Things' this year, Netflix House has some immersive experiences in Dallas for you. Witness a de-aged Will run from a tree-climbing Demogorgon ahead of the final season of 'Stranger Things' this November on Netflix. Ahead of 'Stranger Things' season 5, Netflix has given us a first look at its new animated spinoff, coming in 2026. The sequel to Netflix's biggest film of all time is aiming at a 2029 release.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over the last few years, these fraudsters have sent millions of scam text messages—often impersonating the USPS or toll-road collection firms—and allegedly made more than a billion dollars from their brazen schemes. Now, in one of the most high-profile actions against the scammers so far, Google is suing alleged members of one “relentless” Chinese smishing group that it claims has tried to con people in more than 120 countries around the world. In a civil lawsuit filed today in the US Southern District of New York, Google alleges that 25 unnamed individuals have operated as part of the “Lighthouse” scam network and targeted millions of Americans with texts in a “staggering” operation. As well as “stealing” information and money from people globally, the Lighthouse Enterprise, which is sometimes known as part of the “Smishing Triad,” also “preys on the public trust in Google” by using its logos on fraudulent websites and abusing its systems and technology, the company's lawsuit claims. “With the rise in scams, it's largely due to the action of organized crime networks, and most of them are transnational,” Halimah DeLaine Prado, general counsel at Google, alleges in an interview with WIRED. The Lighthouse group is one of several Chinese-speaking smishing groups that have emerged in recent years. Broadly, the groups blast out scam messages to thousands of people using SMS, Google's RCS service, or Apple's iMessage. If someone enters their details into these false websites, the scammers can collect their personal information and bank details in real time. This software is developed by cybercriminals and then sold as a subscription service to less technically capable fraudsters who use it to send the scam text messages. Scammers can purchase “weekly, monthly, seasonal, annual, or permanent” subscriptions to use the software, Google's lawsuit claims. “The Lighthouse platform is a phishing-as-a-service tool used by cybercriminals to steal bank and card information, offering ready-made phishing templates, fake websites, and backend management tools, enabling collection of usernames, passwords, and one-time codes, and it supports large-scale message delivery via iMessage and Google Messages' RCS (Rich Communication Services) channels rather than just SMS,” says Halit Alptekin, chief intelligence officer at security firm Prodaft, which has tracked the Chinese-speaking phishing ecosystem. The Lighthouse platform has been widely used, according to research from cybersecurity firm Silent Push. Across a 20-day period, Silent Push analysis alleged that activity linked to Lighthouse had targeted people in at least 121 countries and that 200,000 scam websites can be linked back to the network. Citing research by the CSIS Security Group, Google's legal filings claim that the Lighthouse network may have stolen between “12.7 million and 115 million” US credit or banking card details. Google's lawsuit against two dozen individuals it says it has linked to the Lighthouse operation alleges how the broader network is made up of several types of cybercriminals: data brokers, who provide lists of people to target with scams; spammers, who provide the tech needed to send messages en masse; a theft group of individuals using stolen account details to access victims' bank accounts; and administrators who organize the groups. These impersonate more than 400 entities or organizations, the firm says in its lawsuit. Around 200 of these templates spoof organizations in the United States, such as the US Postal Service, New York City's government website, New York's E-ZPass website, multiple state-level departments of transportation websites, and more. Google's DeLaine Prado tells WIRED that the company has spent significant time and resources trying to crack down on the scammers' behavior. “It enables others to do the same as well. The company also says it is now supporting multiple bipartisan bills in the US Congress, including those against scams, robocalls, and scam compounds. Telegram did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment. Although the legal action could potentially help to dismantle what are alleged to be some of Chinese smishing groups' operations, it is possible that the groups will adapt. In recent years, the Lighthouse software has been updated multiple times, with new capabilities being added to it and frequent additions of new phishing templates, experts say. “The wider Chinese-speaking smishing actors and fraud ecosystem are continually evolving and growing, and they have been incredibly innovative at every step,” says Ford Merrill, a security researcher who tracks the operations at SecAlliance, which is part of the CSIS Security Group. “They have incredibly capable real-time modular phishing tools that allow so many possibilities for defrauding their victims,” Merrill says. Update: 11/12/2025, 10:43 am EDT: WIRED clarified how criminals are using SMS blasters, in relation to a quote from Ford Merrill.

Eighty years they drained the coastal lowland swamps making central Israel broadly livable - prior it was a morass eg Roman generals writing about the difficulty of transporting soldiers through the region, not catching malaria, etc.Then they figured out it was causing all kinds of environmental problems, so they had to reintroduce swamp like terrain in some cases.Everything is trade offs I guess.

IIRC reswamping is mostly done for rewilding terrain. A lot of migratory birds passing through area.The only hard problem caused by "terraforming", it's that because of water from Sea of Galilee not allowed fully to flow to Dead Sea, it's level gone down and it created a lot of sink holes.To mitigate it, there is another long discussed pumping projects that can't lift off:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea%E2%80%93Dead_Sea_Water...
