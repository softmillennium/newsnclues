                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Waymo robotaxis will now take passengers on freeways in three major U.S. cities, marking a major milestone for the driverless, ride-hailing company. Alphabet-owned Waymo on Wednesday said it will begin offering those types of trips in the San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles markets "when a freeway route is meaningfully faster." The Google sister company will gradually extend freeway trips to more riders and locations over time. Although Waymo's driverless cars have previously taken passengers on smaller highways and side streets, Wednesday's expansion marks the first time the company will take payment from public riders to go on freeways with higher speed limits. "Freeway driving is one of those things that's very easy to learn, but very hard to master when we're talking about full autonomy without a human driver as a backup, and at scale," Waymo co-CEO Dmitri Dolgov said at a press event ahead of the announcement. Waymo vehicles will generally travel up to a freeway's maximum posted speed limit, which is 65 mph in many cases, the company said. However, a spokesperson confirmed, the robotaxis may sometimes go a few miles over the limit for safety purposes in extraordinary circumstances. Freeway operations required expanded operational protocols, including coordination with safety officials at the California Highway Patrol and the Arizona Department of Public Safety, Waymo said. Over the last year, Waymo has offered select Alphabet employees robotaxi freeway rides around San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix in preparation for Wednesday's launch, said Waymo Product Manager Jacopo Sannazzaro. The company has been testing on freeways for more than a decade in total, he added. Besides testing on public roads and closed courses, Waymo also conducts testing in simulation to determine how its vehicles will respond to both typical and hard-to-replicate events, like merging onto freeways, lane-splitting motorcyclists or another car flipping over. After already launching its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles, Waymo has also announced plans to expand to Miami, San Diego and Washington, D.C., in 2026. The company is also testing its vehicles in New York City, Tokyo and plans to begin offering rides to the public in London next year. The SJC airport plans were first announced in September. In 2023, Waymo launched at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, which has become its most popular destination in the Phoenix metropolitan service area. The company expanded its service in March to include an additional 27 square miles of coverage in the region, including cities like Mountain View and Palo Alto. After the Wednesday expansion, Waymo now offers service in about 260 square miles of Silicon Valley. Would-be Waymo competitor Tesla also takes passengers to and from SJC. Customers can hail a ride via Tesla's "Robotaxi" app, but that name is not precisely descriptive. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Israel-Iran War:

IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi

United Nations nuclear inspectors said they are seriously concerned about the status of Iran's inventory of near-bomb-grade uranium, as the Islamic Republic continues to deny them access to sites bombed several months ago by the US and Israel.

The International Atomic Energy Agency reiterated it hasn't been able to verify Iran's fuel stockpile since mid-June, according to documents seen by Bloomberg. It's the first IAEA report since the UN security council reimposed sanctions that demand Iran suspend enrichment activities. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anthropic announced plans Wednesday to spend $50 billion on a U.S. artificial intelligence infrastructure build-out, starting with custom data centers in Texas and New York. The facilities, which will be designed to support the company's rapid enterprise growth and its long-term research agenda, will be developed in partnership with Fluidstack. Fluidstack is an AI cloud platform that supplies large-scale graphics processing unit, or GPU, clusters to clients like Meta, Midjourney and Mistral. Additional sites are expected to follow, with the first locations going live in 2026. The project is expected to create 800 permanent jobs and more than 2,000 construction roles. The investment positions Anthropic as a major domestic player in physical AI infrastructure at a moment when policymakers are increasingly focused on U.S.-based compute capacity and technological sovereignty. "We're getting closer to AI that can accelerate scientific discovery and help solve complex problems in ways that weren't possible before. "These sites will help us build more capable AI systems that can drive those breakthroughs, while creating American jobs." The move comes as Anthropic rival OpenAI pushes forward with an aggressive build-out of its own. The ChatGPT maker has secured more than $1.4 trillion in long-term infrastructure commitments through deals with Nvidia, Broadcom, Oracle and the major cloud providers, including Microsoft, Google, and, most recently, Amazon. Anthropic serves more than 300,000 businesses, with enterprise clients driving most of its revenue. The number of large accounts, which generate more than $100,000 annually, has nearly increased sevenfold in the past year. Internal projections obtained by The Wall Street Journal showed Anthropic expects to break even by 2028, well ahead of OpenAI, which is projecting $74 billion in operating losses that same year. To support that trajectory, Anthropic tapped Fluidstack to build custom facilities optimized for its AI workloads, citing the firm's speed and ability to deliver gigawatts of power on short timelines. The $11 billion facility is already up and running, while many competitors are still promising data centers of the future. Last week, OpenAI asked the Trump administration to expand a key CHIPS Act tax credit to include AI data centers and grid components like transformers, according to a letter obtained by Bloomberg. That request followed backlash over comments from CFO Sarah Friar, who had floated the idea of a government "backstop" for OpenAI's compute deals.

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A fired executive at WPP is suing the advertising agency giant, accusing the company of retaliating against him and firing him after he raised concerns that the group's media investment division was allegedly running an improper kickback operation. Richard Foster spent 17 years working for GroupM, WPP's media arm, which controls more than $60 billion in advertising spending for clients such as Google, Unilever, and Ford. Foster was formerly the global chief executive of Motion Content Group, a division of GroupM/WPP Media that produces and co-finances TV series such as "Love Island" and brokers other entertainment partnerships. The lawsuit says that Foster grew increasingly concerned about a practice within GroupM's trading division known as "volume-based discounts." GroupM would leverage the power of its billions of dollars in client ad budgets to secure incentives from media owners — such as cash rebates or free or discounted inventory — but not always disclose or pass these back to clients, the lawsuit alleges. He claims that when he brought this to top management, the agency group reacted by firing him rather than investigating his concerns. Receiving media rebates isn't illegal in the US. That said, the ad industry has previously been warned by legal experts that rebates could amount to a breach of contract or even fraud if not disclosed to the client or if advertisers were deceived about the practice. Public companies are required to accurately record all income, including rebates, in their financial statements. The suit doesn't provide further documentation to support this claim. The following year, the Association of National Advertisers, a US trade body, published a bombshell report by the corporate investigations firm K2 Intelligence, which alleged rebates and other non-transparent business practices were "pervasive" among US media agencies. It comes at a rocky time for WPP, which has said it expects to report a second consecutive annual revenue decline this year. Foster said he repeatedly raised concerns over the years with senior WPP and GroupM executives, including Nicola McCormick, WPP's general counsel for media, that rebate deals were unethical and posed a significant legal risk to the company, the lawsuit alleges. Foster says he also detailed his recommendations to develop a new WPP Entertainment division, to build on what he had achieved with Motion Content Group. Upon Lesser's request, Foster submitted a 35-page report after the meeting that included a section outlining his concerns about GroupM's rebate practices, the lawsuit says. Foster estimated in the report that GroupM derived nearly $1 billion in global net sales from "non-product-related income," such as rebates and "purchase risk" media deals. Foster claims many large advertisers were opposed to such deals because they were designed to benefit an agency's bottom line rather than the client's. The suit appears to describe a form of what's known in the industry as principal media buying, so-called because by buying inventory and reselling it to clients, agencies act as a "principal," or vendor. A report published last year by the ANA found that principal media buying was on the rise at holding companies due to downward pressure on agency margins and a push from marketers to bring down media prices. The report found that principal media can save advertisers between 10% and 15% in media costs, but some marketers had concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the quality of the media they were purchasing. The lawsuit says that in a phone call with Foster in January of this year, Lesser initially expressed concerns about potential risks tied to such deals, but later asked him via text to reproduce a "sanitized" version of his report to exclude any overt criticism of GroupM's trading operations. Unbeknownst to Foster, Lesser had already sent a copy of the original report to Mark Patterson, the executive responsible for GroupM's trading activities. Patterson is currently WPP Media's global president of markets and business operations. Hours after that text, the suit says, Foster was "blindsided" by a restructure announcement that saw the sports and entertainment divisions report directly to Patterson. Foster alleges in the lawsuit that he was then immediately excluded from key meetings, cut out of deals, and isolated from decision-making. In July, GroupM terminated Foster without cause, the lawsuit says. "At no point did WPP or WPP Media conduct a formal review or investigation into Foster's reports, as required under their compliance policies and applicable whistleblower protection laws, nor was corrective action ever taken," the lawsuit says. The lawsuit, filed in the New York State Supreme Court, is seeking more than $100 million in damages for charges of retaliation, wrongful termination, and violations of whistleblower protection laws. It also misstated a change of roles within the company.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase is following Tesla out of Delaware and into Texas. Paul Grewal, Coinbase's chief legal officer, wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Wednesday that the crypto exchange is moving its state of incorporation, a year after Elon Musk did the same with his electric vehicle maker. Musk also reincorporated his rocket maker SpaceX from Delaware to Texas. "Delaware's legal framework once provided companies with consistency. But no more," Grawal wrote, pointing to recent "unpredictable outcomes" in the Delaware Chancery Court. A handful of notable names, including Dropbox, TripAdvisor and venture firm Andreessen Horowitz have announced departures from Delaware. It's a move that was championed by Musk following a Delaware Chancery Court ruling that ordered Tesla to rescind the CEO's 2018 pay package, worth about $56 billion in options. "If your company is still incorporated in Delaware, I recommend moving to another state as soon as possible," Musk wrote in a post on X in February 2024, when he filed to change SpaceX's incorporation state. Last week, Tesla shareholders voted to approve Musk's more recent pay package, which could be worth up to $1 trillion. Delaware has long been the dominant state for U.S. companies to incorporate due to its flexible corporate code and expert judiciary, and is seen as balancing the rights of executives and shareholders. A Texas state law allows corporations to limit shareholder lawsuits against insiders for breach of fiduciary duty.

A new, first-of-its-kind "drone wall" built to defeat Russia's most menacing weapons before they can reach cities and civilians is set to be deployed in Ukraine soon, its maker told Business Insider. Russian one-way attack drones and glide bombs have been two of the most challenging threats Ukraine is facing. One-way attack drones — specifically, the Russian Shahed-style loitering munitions — are employed in nightly attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure. Sometimes, hundreds are included in a single bombardment, which can overwhelm air defenses. And glide bombs are dumb bombs equipped with special kits that turn them into precision-guided munitions able to be launched from aircraft at standoff ranges beyond the reach of Ukrainian air defenses. With small radar signatures, short flight times, and non-ballistic trajectories, these weapons are difficult to intercept. NATO, which has closely monitored Russian threats, hosted an "Innovation Challenge" in March for Ukrainian and Western defense companies to submit solutions for combating this kind of weaponry. The battery-powered drones, each carrying small explosive payloads, can then be layered and spaced apart. "We consider ourselves as a last layer of defense," Atreyd's founder said. The system is designed to be cheap; the cost of interception is just a few thousand dollars, and the drones that don't detonate can return to their launch platforms to be used in a later air defense mission. Atreyd said that the drone wall can operate in GPS-denied environments because it is equipped with a pre-installed 3D map of its area of responsibility, a notable feature given the widespread use of electronic warfare and signal jamming on the battlefields in Ukraine. The drones can operate at altitudes of several thousand meters and are equipped with identification technology to prevent friendly fire incidents. Atreyd said one soldier can typically operate 100 drones, and they don't need any specific qualifications, either, nor do they need to be an established drone pilot. The drone wall has a 100% success rating in testing, Atreyd said. In Ukraine, the drone wall could be used to defend its cities, energy infrastructure, and other civilian areas that are regularly under fire from devastating Russian attacks. Atreyd's founder would not disclose exactly where, in Ukraine, the drone wall will be deployed, citing operational security concerns. However, they said it will be permanently stationed there and can expand to other locations in the country with domestically manufactured drones. While Atreyd is developing ambitious launch platforms — such as uncrewed vehicles, flying motherships, and even a zeppelin — for foreign militaries, the drone wall that is being deployed to Ukraine will take off from ground stations for now. The drone wall's deployment comes as Russia has modified its drones and glide bombs with jet engines, enabling the weapons to travel faster and creating new headaches for Ukrainian air defenses. Atreyd's founder is confident that the system will still be effective against them. If the alliance is caught unprepared, "we are going to lose big."</p>

Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman's expectations for how his employees work at the office are uniquely strict within the company. Suleyman requires employees to work from the office more than is standard at the company and generally prefers to have open floor plans, a polarizing concept at Microsoft and in engineering in general. "I very much believe in the in-person working culture," Suleyman told Business Insider. "We've been defragmenting our culture and trying to concentrate." Microsoft recently announced a new return-to-office mandate requiring most employees to work in an office at least three days a week, starting January 26. In contrast, Suleyman requires at least four-days-a-week for his employees who live near an office, according to an internal document viewed by Business Insider. Any exceptions must be approved by an executive who reports to Suleyman directly. You can feel the buzz, like there's a real intensity about the place, and it just creates a lot more, like informal collaboration. The AI executive also has a penchant for hanging in Silicon Valley. Suleyman splits his time between Silicon Valley and Seattle, but said most of his team is in Silicon Valley versus Microsoft's Redmond headquarters. Microsoft leaves RTO and office-layout decisions up to individual organizations or teams. The company's Corporate, External, and Legal Affairs team, for example, has been working at least four days a week from the office for about a year. Other teams working on AI have less strict guidelines. Executive Scott Guthrie's Cloud + AI organization has no org-specific return-to-office guidelines or considerations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chinese automakers are stepping up investment in South Africa, with two leading Chinese carmakers, Beijing Automotive Group (BAIC) and Chery, set to build factories and expand local manufacturing. Chinese automakers are stepping up investment in South Africa, with Beijing Automotive Group (BAIC) and Chery unveiling plans to expand local manufacturing; a move that underscores Africa's growing role in the global auto industry. With intense competition in their home market and increasing trade restrictions in Europe and the United States, Chinese carmakers are turning to Africa as a key growth market. South Africa, with its well-established automotive infrastructure and rising consumer demand, has emerged as a prime destination for these strategic investments. BAIC, alongside BYD and Chery, is among roughly 18 Chinese brands now active in South Africa. BAIC South Africa plans to begin assembling its newly launched B30 off-road SUV at the same facility as early as January, according to Chief Financial Officer Anele Geza. The move marks a major step toward boosting local production and integrating more deeply into South Africa's manufacturing base. Speaking at the B30 launch event, Geza said the new B30 combustion engine and hybrid models will be assembled locally using a completely knocked-down (CKD) process, which involves building cars from numerous smaller parts to increase local content. “We will continue to introduce more new models while steadily expanding local production and value creation.” The company confirmed it is conducting feasibility studies on local production as it seeks to strengthen its presence in a market that has quickly warmed to Chinese vehicles. “We're currently conducting feasibility studies in South Africa, which remains a key focus for both Omoda and Jaecoo,” the company said. “The country plays an important role in our broader global strategy, and we're carefully assessing opportunities to expand our presence and meet the growing local demand.” Globally, Chinese automakers have been expanding their manufacturing footprints to diversify production and hedge against trade barriers.

Former DocuSign CEO Dan Springer graduated from Harvard Business School, but he says holding an Ivy League degree won't help his employees score a promotion during their annual reviews. It matters to me that people did something great," Springer said in an interview with Business Insider. In April, he left DocuSign's board and joined Ironclad, a contract management software company, as CEO. Springer graduated with an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1991. He then joined McKinsey and worked at the consulting firm for over six years. Springer said that when it comes to vetting people for promotions, he looks at three variables: an employee's skills, their ego, and how hard they work. Those come together for him as a formula. "You don't want to have a big ego. You want to maintain the ego and focus on the company and our customers, and then you raise that to the power of how hard they work." Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder and CEO of the hedge fund Citadel, told his summer interns in 2022 that people needed to aggressively pitch themselves for bigger roles and responsibilities. "Don't be shy in asking for bigger problems to take on. Don't be shy about asking for a promotion. What's the worst they're going to say — that you're too ambitious?" Luis von Ahn, the cofounder and CEO of Duolingo, wrote in a LinkedIn post on September 22 that new hires who wanted to succeed at his company should be proactive at solving problems. In his post, von Ahn said Duolingo didn't have a company blog, until an engineer took the initiative to start one. Von Ahn said that the engineer "did way better at Duolingo" than his colleague, who only complained about the problem instead of doing something about it. We're still figuring lots of things out, and if you see a problem, you can actually do something about it here," von Ahn added.</p>
