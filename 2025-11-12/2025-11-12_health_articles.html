                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Published today in Mayo Clinic Proceedings, a University of Minnesota Medical School research team found that access to wheelchairs through Medicare-listed suppliers is inconsistent and often challenging. Using a secret-shopper approach where researchers posed as patients seeking care, the research team evaluated insurance acceptance, administrative requirements, delivery timelines and costs in two urban zip codes. Only one-half of suppliers with wheelchairs in supply accepted Medicare, and many imposed additional documentation requirements. Among these suppliers, nearly half reported it would take several weeks before wheelchair approval and delivery. For those paying cash, the median wheelchair cost was $300. Patients attempting to access a wheelchair through suppliers listed in the Medicare directory face administrative and logistical challenges, highlighting the need for urgent policy form to assist vulnerable older adults in accessing critical medical equipment. Greater oversight of supplier practices, clearer standards and improved directory accuracy are needed to reduce administrative and financial barriers for beneficiaries." Arjun Gupta, MBBS, assistant professor, University of Minnesota Medical School "Patients with mobility issues are often forced to navigate a maze of phone calls, insurance rejections and paperwork just to get a basic wheelchair. These delays and barriers leave many with no choice but to pay out-of-pocket through online marketplaces or other sources- this is an unacceptable burden on those already facing health problems," said Dr. Gupta, who is also an oncologist with M Health Fairview.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Molecular and genetic testing has become a game-changer in brain tumor care - shaping diagnosis, guiding treatments and opening doors to new therapies. Once available to a handful of patients, these tests are now rapidly being adopted across the NHS, according to a new study led by Professor Kathreena Kurian at the University of Bristol and the Tessa Jowell Brain Cancer Mission. But the study also exposes deep regional inequalities. Access across the UK still depends on postcode, with some hospitals hampered by transport and processing delays, and others lacking the means to freeze tumor samples after surgery - a basic requirement for advanced testing. Study lead, Professor Kurian from the University of Bristol and North Bristol NHS Trust, the issue is both scientific and personal. She said: "My husband, Gerard, was able to access cutting-edge treatment through a trial at the Royal Marsden. "Unfortunately, not all patients are given that same opportunity – often unaware that something as simple as how tissue is stored can determine what treatments or trials, they might later access. The study was conducted in collaboration with the Tessa Jowell Brain Cancer Mission, a national convening body of cancer charities, the Department of Health and Social Care and 47 NHS hospitals, committed to promoting equitable access to brain tumor care. Using data collected as part of the Tessa Jowell Centre of Excellence from NHS centres covering 84% of the UK population, the research team found that although genomic testing has expanded rapidly – with a 291% increase in whole genome sequencing (WGS) since 2021 – many services are struggling to keep pace. As well as the need for equitable investment and adoption of new innovations highlighted by the study, Professor Kurian sets out three practical steps that can be taken to achieve equity of access: We have seen extraordinary progress in brain tumor genomics over the past few years, thanks to the hard work of staff in our hospitals and the NHS's commitment to commissioning these advanced tests for brain tumor patients. But it is vital that this transformation benefits not just some but all patients, irrespective of where they are diagnosed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) has demonstrated a new application for its cell-expansion bioreactor to advance tissue engineering and cell-based therapies for treatment of injuries and diseases. Their pluripotent state allows iPSCs to differentiate into any other cell type in the body, much like embryonic stem cells but without the same ethical ambiguity. Large quantities of iPSCs are needed for regenerative medicine and individualized healthcare, but current technology requires manual production. Using the SwRI-developed single-use 3D-printed bioreactor, we successfully harvested significant quantities of iPSCs. We are working on further differentiating those iPSCs into neural progenitor cells, which could support the regeneration of neurons that are damaged due to injury. International studies have shown that neural progenitor cells can repair the spinal cord when administered in the first 28 days following a spinal cord injury." Dr. Nick Mc Mahon,  Senior Research Scientist, leader on the project SwRI's 3D printed bioreactor matrix boasts a larger surface-to-volume ratio compared to traditional 2D cell culture devices such as flasks or dishes, and it can grow more cells using an automated perfusion method. Unlike embryonic stem cells, iPSCs pose no ethical controversy, making them a promising and responsible path toward personalized medicine," said Institute Engineer Dr. Jian Ling. This project received funding through SwRI's Internal Research and Development Program. To learn more, visit: Southwest Research Institute Internal R&D.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Autophagy, the process by which cells remove damaged organelles and pathogens, plays a vital role in maintaining cellular health. Yet its role during viral infection has remained elusive. Herpesviruses have evolved strategies to sometimes evade autophagic degradation, such as by producing particular proteins that inhibit autophagy. Two human herpesviruses that can lead to cancer are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), both of which are part of the gamma-herpesvirus sub-family. Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is linked to several conditions, including Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), B-cell primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD), and osteosarcoma. In sub-Saharan Africa and Mediterranean regions, seroprevalence can vary from 20 % to 80 % across both genders. Currently, the autophagy process during KSHV entry into host cells remains unclear. Additionally, there is no curative treatment or vaccine for KSHV infection, highlighting the importance of understanding early immune responses to KSHV entry. This understanding could potentially lead to new targets for antiviral therapies. The autophagy marker, cytosolic microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), was shown to co-localize with viral capsid proteins, signaling that the cell's defense machinery was engaging incoming viruses. Through correlative confocal microscopy using the Thermo Scientific Helios 5 Hydra UX DualBeam (focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope - FIB-SEM) and reconstructed in Thermo Scientific Amira Software, scientists produced high-resolution 3D models revealing that KSHV particles reside within amphisomes, fusion vesicles formed between autophagosomes and endosomes. These structures indicate that cells actively target virus-damaged compartments for degradation. Ultrastructural images of KSHV-containing vesicles and their three-dimensional reconstructions reveal amphisomal structures. Image Credit: Figure reproduced from Schmidt et al. under CC-BY 4.0. Through quantitative co-localization analysis, the researchers were able to visualize and analyze molecular interactions, confirming that the galectin-8-NDP52 partnership is central to early antiviral defense. The integrative imaging workflow, linking confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, and image segmentation in Amira Software, was key to visualizing the sequence of molecular events that drive viral restriction. These capabilities confirmed that selective autophagy serves as a rapid, effective antiviral defense, intercepting KSHV before infection is established. The discovery that selective autophagy restricts KSHV infection through the recruitment of galectin-8 and NDP52 marks a significant step forward in understanding how cells defend themselves against viral invasion. With Amira Software, scientists can explore these complex biological processes in remarkable 3D detail, transforming visualization into a powerful tool for discovery.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A research team in South Korea has successfully developed a novel technology that combines nanoparticles with stem cells to significantly improve 3D bone tissue regeneration. This advancement marks a major step forward in the treatment of bone fractures and injuries, as well as in next-generation regenerative medicine. Dr. Ki Young Kim and her team at the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT), in collaboration with Professor Laura Ha at Sunmoon University, have engineered a nanoparticle-stem cell hybrid, termed a nanobiohybrid by integrating mesoporous silica nanoparticles (mSiO₂ NPs) with human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSCs). The resulting hybrid cells demonstrated markedly enhanced osteogenic (bone-forming) capability. Three-dimensional stem cell aggregates such as spheroids and organoids have long been used to mimic organ and tissue structures. The nanoparticles function both as structural scaffolds and osteogenic stimulators, slowly releasing bone-promoting biomolecules that guide the stem cells to differentiate uniformly into bone tissue. In a mouse calvarial (skull) defect model, the implanted nanobiohybrid spheroids regenerated 36% of the defected bone area within six weeks, achieving approximately 1.3 fold greater bone regeneration than spheroids made of stem cells alone. Although the study is currently at the preclinical animal stage, the researchers expect that this platform could be further developed into patient-specific bone grafts after validation in large animal models and clinical studies. This approach can be extended beyond bone to regenerate various tissues such as cartilage and skin." KRICT President Dr. Young-Kuk Lee added, "We hope that our stem-cell-based regenerative technology will help improve treatments for bone fracture patients in an aging society." This research was published in the journal ACS Biomaterials Science & Engineering (Impact Factor: 5.5) in August 2025, with Dr. Ki Young Kim as the corresponding author and Professor Laura Ha as the first author.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conventional wearable ultrasound sensors have been limited by low power output and poor structural stability, making them unsuitable for high-resolution imaging or therapeutic applications. This breakthrough opens new possibilities for wearable medical devices that can capture precise, body-conforming images and perform noninvasive treatments using ultrasound energy. KAIST (President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced on November 12 that a research team led by Professor Hyunjoo Jenny Lee from the School of Electrical Engineering developed a "flex-to-rigid (FTR)" capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) capable of transitioning freely between flexibility and rigidity using a semiconductor wafer process (MEMS). Conventional polymer-membrane-based CMUTs have suffered from a low elastic modulus, resulting in insufficient acoustic power and blurred focal points during vibration. They have also lacked curvature control, limiting precise focusing on target regions. Professor Lee's team designed an FTR structure that combines a rigid silicon substrate with a flexible elastomer bridge, achieving both high output performance and mechanical flexibility. The embedded LMPA enables dynamic adjustment and fixation of the transducer's shape by toggling between solid and liquid states through electrical control. As a result, the new sensor can automatically focus ultrasound on a specific region according to its curvature - without requiring separate beamforming electronics - and maintains stable electrical and acoustic performance even after repeated bending. The device's acoustic output reaches the level of low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU), which can gently stimulate tissues to induce therapeutic effects without causing damage. In the future, the team plans to extend this technology to a two-dimensional (2D) array structure - arranging multiple sensors in a grid - to enable simultaneous high-resolution ultrasound imaging and therapeutic applications, paving the way for a new generation of smart medical systems. Because the technology is compatible with semiconductor fabrication processes, it can be mass-produced and adapted for wearable and home-use ultrasound systems. This study was conducted by Sang-Mok Lee, Xiaojia Liang (co-first authors), and their collaborators under the supervision of Professor Hyunjoo Jenny Lee. The results were published online on October 23 in npj Flexible Electronics (Impact Factor: 15.5).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A first-of-its-kind UK study reveals that while teachers feel more confident tackling vaping in the classroom, widespread confusion about how harmful vaping really is shows schools still need clearer, evidence-based messages for students. Researchers at King's College London and their collaborators have recently explored the experiences of teachers who deliver smoking and vaping prevention materials to secondary school students in Great Britain (GB). The study, which is published in PLOS ONE, suggests the potential effectiveness of smoking prevention programs in improving teachers' knowledge about vaping and smoking and changing vaping harm perceptions among students. The usage of electronic cigarettes, commonly known as vaping, has increased among adolescents and young adults in GB over the past decade. Although vaping is commonly perceived as less harmful than smoking, biomarker and observational studies indicate that vaping exposes young people to nicotine and other potentially harmful toxicants, and long-term vaping may have adverse health outcomes. Regular exposure to nicotine through vaping can also induce addictive behaviors among young people. In GB, several youth vaping prevention campaigns have been initiated to increase awareness about potential health adversities and restrain youth from using electronic-cigarettes (e-cigarettes). The majority of these campaigns focus on potential health risks of vaping, which may help reduce vaping in youth, but at the same time may increase misperceptions that vaping is equally or more harmful than smoking. Such misperceptions may, in turn, increase the likelihood of smoking, which is a more harmful behavior. Vaping prevention campaigns should therefore be designed carefully to prevent the spread of misperceptions. INTENT is an evidence-based smoking prevention program in GB that targets secondary school students. The program is based on implementation intentions, which are “if-then” plans that specify how, where, and when to perform a behavior. Existing evidence suggests that INTENT was previously found to weaken the association between vaping and subsequent smoking among school students. Given concerns about youth vaping among local authorities and teachers, as well as the lack of evidence-based educational materials on vaping in GB, INTENT was expanded in 2022 to include information on vaping-related health risks (INTENT youth vaping prevention materials). The current survey, led by researchers from King's College London, aimed to explore the experiences of teachers who deliver the INTENT youth vaping prevention materials to school students in England and Scotland. A total of 45 teachers were surveyed online in 2024. They were recruited from 10 schools across four regions of England and Scotland, so the sample was not nationally representative. The primary objective of the survey was to collect self-reported information about teachers' experiences of delivering INTENT materials in schools, their perceptions about the impact of INTENT on students, and their perceptions about levels of vaping and smoking in schools. More than 50% of teachers who participated in the survey reported that their students possess or use e-cigarettes at least once a week. About 96% of teachers perceived vaping as a problem in their schools. Regarding reasons for delivery, approximately 89% of respondents reported that these materials are important for teaching students about vaping, 58% expressed concerns about vaping in schools, and 53% specified the requirement to teach about vaping as part of school policy. Regarding the effectiveness of INTENT materials, the majority of teachers reported a change in their perception about vaping harm, although misperceptions that vaping is equally or more harmful than smoking remained high among them. Regarding the impact of INTENT materials on students, most teachers reported that their students are engaged with the materials and that the materials encourage students to make informed choices about vaping. However, about 36% of teachers perceived that these materials had no effect on their students' vaping habits, and 31% reported that they did not know whether there was any change. This survey is the first of its kind to assess teachers' experiences with vaping and the delivery of vaping prevention materials to school students in GB. The survey findings reveal that the INTENT youth vaping prevention materials have the potential to change perceptions of teachers about vaping harm and encourage students to make informed choices about vaping. These findings highlight the feasibility of implementing INTENT or similar programs in schools to improve youth health. Notably, the survey finds that misperceptions about vaping being equally or more harmful than smoking persist among a group of teachers even after going through the INTENT materials. In this context, researchers noted that since they were unable to collect data before delivering the materials, pre- and post-intervention analyses could not be conducted. There remains a possibility that harm perceptions were already higher before the delivery of INTENT, particularly since vaping misperceptions are pervasive among teachers and in the general population.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shift Bioscience (Shift), a biotechnology company uncovering the biology of cell rejuvenation to end the morbidity and mortality of aging, today announced the release of new research detailing an improved framework for evaluating benchmark metric calibration in virtual cell models. Using well-calibrated metrics, the study demonstrates that virtual cell models consistently outperform key baselines, providing valuable and actionable biological insights to accelerate target identification pipelines. Genetic perturbation response models are a subset of AI virtual cells used to predict how cells will respond to various genetic alterations, including up- and down-regulation of genes. These models are a valuable tool to augment target identification pipelines, providing a rapidly scalable, in silico solution to identify promising genetic targets without the time and resource requirements of wet lab experiments. However, recently published papers have questioned the utility of these models to correctly identify gene targets, noting concerns that virtual cell models fail to outperform simple, uninformative baselines in some experiments. In this latest study from Shift Bioscience, the team demonstrated that incidents of poor model performance largely reflect metric miscalibration, with commonly-used metrics routinely failing to distinguish robust predictions from uninformative ones, particularly in datasets with weaker perturbations. Building on this finding, the team developed an improved framework for metric calibration. Using 14 perturb-seq datasets, the team identified several rank-based and DEG (Differentially Expressed Gene)-aware metrics that are well-calibrated across datasets. Virtual cell models evaluated using these well-calibrated metrics were able to consistently outperform uninformative mean, control and linear baselines, providing clear evidence that virtual cell models can distinguish biologically significant signals when appropriate calibration is applied. These results challenge prior reports that genetic perturbation models do not work, and suggest that AI Virtual Cells can be effectively applied for target discovery. This latest research from our talented team provides clear evidence that the reports of poor performance in AI virtual cells is largely due to limitations of metrics, not due to issues with the models. We showed that when models are evaluated on well-calibrated metrics, they perform quite well and consistently outperform key baselines. We believe that this work opens the door to more widespread use of virtual cells and reinforces our confidence in the virtual cell models that are helping to drive our target identification program for cell rejuvenation."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have long established that hormones significantly affect the brain, creating changes in emotion, energy levels, and decision-making. However, the intricacies of these processes are not well understood. A new study by a team of scientists focusing on the female hormone estrogen further illuminates the nature of these processes. In a series of experiments with laboratory rats, it finds that the neurological mechanisms underlying learning and decision-making naturally fluctuate over the female reproductive cycle due to previously undetected molecular changes related to dopamine, which broadcasts the "reward" signals that guide learning throughout the brain. Despite the broad influence of hormones throughout the brain, little is known about how these hormones influence cognitive behaviors and related neurological activity. There is a growing realization in the medical community that changes in estrogen levels are related to cognitive function and, specifically, psychiatric disorders." Christine Constantinople, professor in New York University's Center for Neural Science and the paper's senior author "Our results provide a potential biological explanation that bridges dopamine's function with learning in ways that better inform our understanding of both health and disease," adds Carla Golden, an NYU postdoctoral fellow and the paper's lead author. This happens, the authors write, because estrogen boosts dopamine activity in the brain's reward center, making reward signals stronger. By contrast, when estrogen activity was suppressed, curbing its ability to regulate dopamine, learning capabilities were diminished-and pointed to a potential connection between hormone levels and symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. Importantly, the researchers note, cognitive decision making was not affected by estrogen activity-the effect was specific to learning. "All neuropsychiatric disorders show fluctuations in symptom severity over hormonal states, suggesting that a better understanding of how hormones influence neural circuits might reveal what causes these diseases," observes Constantinople.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at the University of Southampton have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that can spot hard-to-see objects lodged in patients' airways better than expert radiologists. These accidentally inhaled objects can cause coughing, choking, difficulty breathing and sometimes lead to more serious complications if not treated properly. The findings highlight how AI can support doctors in diagnosing complex and potentially life-threatening conditions. The research has been led by Dr Yihua Wang, Dr Zehor Belkhatir, and Prof Rob Ewing at the University of Southampton in partnership with researchers from Wuhan, China. "These objects can be extremely subtle and easy to miss, even for experienced clinicians," said PhD Researcher Zhe Chen, co-first author of the study from the University of Southampton. "Our AI model acts like a second set of eyes, helping radiologists detect these hidden cases earlier and more reliably." Foreign body aspiration (FBA) occurs when an object, often food or a small piece of material, becomes lodged in the airways. When the objects, such as plant material or crayfish shells, are radiolucent (invisible on X-rays and faint even on CT scans), it can be very difficult to detect. This often leads to missed or delayed diagnoses, putting patients at risk of serious complications. Up to 75 per cent of FBA cases in adults involve radiolucent foreign bodies. To address this challenge, the research team created a deep learning model. It combines a high-precision airway mapping technique (MedpSeg) with a neural network that analyses CT images for hidden signs of foreign bodies. When the radiologists detected a case of radiolucent FBA, they did so with total precision – there were no false positives. In comparison, the AI model did so with 77 per cent precision, detecting some false positives. However, the radiologists missed a large portion of FBA cases, identifying just 36 per cent of them and highlighting the difficulty humans have in spotting such cases. In F1 score, which balances precision and recall, the model outperformed the radiologists with a score of 74 per cent vs 53 per cent. The results demonstrate the real-world potential of AI in medicine, particularly for conditions that are difficult to diagnose through standard imaging." The researchers emphasise that the system is designed to assist, not replace, radiologists - providing an additional layer of confidence in complex or uncertain cases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new review uncovers how the prized truffle's unique mix of antioxidants, polysaccharides, and sterols could make it more than a gourmet delicacy, positioning it as a potential ally in nutrition, medicine, and sustainable food innovation. Bioactive Compounds and Antioxidant Potential of Truffles: A Comprehensive Review. Truffles, the underground fruiting bodies of ectomycorrhizal fungi, are valued for their aroma, rarity, and nutritional richness. The review examined species from the genera Tuber, Terfezia, Tirmania, and Picoa, which support rural economies and forest ecosystems across North America, North Africa, Europe, and Asia. Beyond their culinary importance, truffles possess significant biochemical diversity, making them promising candidates for functional food and therapeutic applications. Recent discoveries, including an endogenous endocannabinoid system and novel polysaccharides, expand their pharmacological relevance. Technological advances in extraction and preservation now enable their use in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical formulations, broadening their market scope beyond gastronomy. Structural polysaccharides, including β-glucans and heteropolysaccharides, exhibit immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties that are influenced by their molecular characteristics. Desert truffles (Terfezia, Tirmania, Picoa) are richer in vitamin C, folate, vitamin E, and β-carotene, while European black and white truffles contribute B-vitamins and vitamin D precursors derived from ergosterol. Notably, Tuber melanosporum contains the endocannabinoid anandamide, which may act as an olfactory attractant for mammal-mediated spore dispersal. Truffles offer high-quality, digestible proteins that contain all essential amino acids, with glutamate and sulfur-containing amino acids contributing to their distinctive umami flavor. Bioactive peptides exhibit antioxidant, antihypertensive, and immune-regulatory effects. The characteristic aroma arises from volatile sulfur compounds, such as bis(methylthio)methane in white truffles and 1-octen-3-ol in black truffles, combined with aldehydes, ketones, and phenolic derivatives responsible for distinctive earthy or garlicky notes. Truffle extracts exhibit a diverse range of biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective, and anticancer effects. Terfezia claveryi extracts show hepatoprotective activity against CCl₄-induced toxicity, while certain Tuber and Terfezia species demonstrate anticancer properties via caspase-3 activation and HER2 oncogene suppression. Additionally, truffle-derived compounds reduce oxidative stress, inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria, and protect hepatic and neural tissues through immune enhancement and the induction of apoptosis. Schematic representation of the main biological activities attributed to truffles and their bioactive compounds. Truffle-derived molecules, including polysaccharides, polyphenols, sterols, carotenoids, and terpenoids, exert multiple health-promoting effects. Such pleiotropic effects highlight the relevance of truffles not only as culinary delicacies but also as promising sources of nutraceutical and therapeutic agents. Preserving truffle bioactivity depends on efficient extraction and storage processes. UAE and enzymatic pretreatment optimize polysaccharide recovery, whereas PLE efficiently isolates β-glucans and ergosterol under mild conditions. Analytical techniques, such as headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME), enable the non-destructive identification of volatile compounds while maintaining their chemical integrity. Post-harvest storage significantly impacts truffle composition and shelf life. Low-temperature storage and freezing slow spoilage but may alter aromatic compounds. Lyophilization best preserves bioactivity when combined with antioxidants or cryoprotectants. Modified atmosphere packaging and edible coatings, such as chitosan or gum Arabic, minimize oxidation and microbial growth. Gentle technologies, including irradiation and high-pressure processing, extend freshness without compromising chemical integrity, ensuring truffles remain viable for food, nutraceutical, and pharmaceutical applications. Due to their antimutagenic, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory properties, truffles are gaining traction in the formulation of dietary supplements, dairy-based functional foods, and beverages. Their extracts are increasingly utilized in cosmetics and perfumery due to their antioxidant and aromatic profiles. While most data are preclinical, future clinical trials and standardized extraction protocols will be crucial for validating therapeutic claims and ensuring reproducibility across products. As demand increases, sustainability is critical, particularly for wild species such as Tuber magnatum, which face overharvesting pressures. Promoting sustainable cultivation practices, integrating traditional ecological knowledge, and advancing bioengineering approaches are essential for long-term viability. Ultimately, truffles represent not only gourmet delicacies but also emerging functional foods with potential preventive and therapeutic applications across the food, nutraceutical, and pharmaceutical industries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at the University of Southampton have identified a new subtype of lymphoma which could pave the way to improved and more targeted treatments for some blood cancer patients. The cancer scientists and biologists have also found that lymphoma cells of this new subtype carry a unique sugar that promotes the survival and growth of the cancer. There are many different types of lymphoma, but this latest breakthrough is in a type called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which affects our B cells. When operating normally, B cells help to fight infection in the body. Lead researcher Professor Francesco Forconi of the University of Southampton's Cancer B-cell Group says: "Patients with this new subtype, Mann-type DLBCL, have a high-risk cancer that cannot respond well to conventional therapies, so identifying this as a distinct group is very important to their treatment programme. They looked for a specific sugar called mannose on the key B-cell receptor and successfully identified it in around a third of all DLBCL. The researchers found that Mann-type DLBCL lymphoma cells always carry this sugar and are not sensitive to conventional anti-cancer drugs. Mannose is found naturally on the surface of many infective agents like viruses, but is typically not abundant on normal human cells. The sugar's presence helps the cancer cells to survive and grow more quickly, making them resistant to standard treatments – eventually resulting in an aggressive form of cancer and poorer outcomes for patients. It is highly unusual to see these kinds of carbohydrates play such a defining role in cancer biology. Finding mannose structures driving tumour growth is remarkable and a powerful example of how interdisciplinary science, combining molecular insight with clinical data, can transform our understanding of disease." This research to identify Mann-type DLBCL means doctors can now recognise specific cases of this type more easily using conventional laboratory tests. The breakthrough means the scientists can now work to find more effective, tailored treatments for this subtype and help provide better patient outcomes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An umbrella review finds that studies suggesting a link between prenatal paracetamol exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders are limited by bias and weak methodology, with stronger analyses showing no clear causal link. Maternal paracetamol (acetaminophen) use during pregnancy and risk of autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder in offspring: umbrella review of systematic reviews. In a recent study published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), researchers analyzed the quality, validity, and biases in existing evidence linking maternal paracetamol (acetaminophen) use during pregnancy with the risk of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children. Paracetamol is one of the most commonly used medications during pregnancy. In response, medical authorities and regulatory health agencies worldwide reaffirmed the established safety of paracetamol during pregnancy, emphasizing that current evidence does not support such warnings. Many primary studies fail to account for key confounders, such as maternal health conditions, genetic factors, and family environment, thereby limiting the ability to draw causal conclusions about in utero exposure. Researchers searched major databases, including Embase, Medline, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PsycINFO, Epistemonikos, and grey literature sources, to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses on maternal paracetamol use and child neurodevelopmental outcomes. Eligible reviews included cohort, cross-sectional, case-control studies, or randomized trials examining prenatal exposure and risk of ADHD or ASD. Titles and abstracts were screened, followed by full-text evaluation. From 663 identified records, nine systematic reviews encompassing 40 primary studies met the inclusion criteria, including four meta-analyses. Most reviews were published within the past decade and focused on maternal use throughout pregnancy. Only one examined both antenatal and postnatal exposure. Most reviews lacked registered protocols, comprehensive search strategies, and justifications for study exclusions. Risk of bias assessments were either incomplete or missing, and none utilized standardized tools such as the ROBINS-I or ROBINS-E. Statistical methods were often inadequate, with only one review pooling adjusted estimates. All reviews reported positive associations between prenatal paracetamol exposure and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, with pooled odds ratios or relative risks for ADHD ranging from 1.2 to 1.4, and smaller associations for ASD. Sensitivity analyses showed stronger associations with longer or third-trimester exposure. However, sibling-controlled analyses, which accounted for shared familial and genetic factors, attenuated these associations to null. This suggests that observed relationships likely stem from familial or unmeasured confounding rather than a causal drug effect. Moreover, overlap among primary studies was high (23%), further limiting interpretability. Seven reviews explicitly cautioned against drawing causal conclusions, emphasizing that apparent risks may reflect study bias and design limitations rather than true biological effects. The collective evidence indicates a weak, non-causal link between maternal paracetamol use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring. Most systematic reviews failed to meet methodological standards necessary for high-confidence conclusions. The BMJ umbrella review concludes that the existing body of evidence does not demonstrate a clear association between prenatal paracetamol exposure and ADHD or ASD. Apparent associations in whole-cohort studies are likely attributable to familial or unmeasured confounding factors rather than a direct pharmacologic effect.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Understanding how living organisms grow under various nutritional environments has long been a central question in biology. While extensive research has explored these limitations, most studies focus only on individual nutrients or specific biochemical reactions, leaving a broader question unanswered: how do complex, interconnected cellular processes collectively regulate growth under constrained conditions? To address this, a research team consisting of ELSI's Specially Appointed Associate Professor Tetsuhiro S. Hatakeyama and RIKEN Special Postdoctoral Researcher Jumpei F. Yamagishi has discovered a unifying principle that explains how all living cells regulate growth when resources are limited. Their study introduces the global constraint principle for microbial growth, a concept that could transform how scientists approach the study of biological systems. However, the model assumes that only one nutrient or biochemical reaction restricts microbial growth. In fact, cells carry out thousands of interacting chemical processes, all competing for the same limited resources. Rather than a single bottleneck, cellular growth is shaped by a network of constraints acting together, resulting in the familiar flattening of growth rates, though caused by an entirely different reason. The global constraint principle explains the fact that when one nutrient becomes more abundant, other factors such as enzyme availability, cell volume, or membrane capacity, begin to limit growth. Using a method called "constraint-based modeling" that models how cells manage their resources, the team showed that adding more nutrients always helps microbes grow, but each additional nutrient has a lower effect on growth than the previous one. "The shape of growth curves emerges directly from the physics of resource allocation inside cells, rather than depending on any particular biochemical reaction," says Hatakeyama. This new principle unites two classic biological laws: the Monod's equation, which describes microbial growth, and the Liebig's law of the minimum, which states that a plant's growth is limited by whichever nutrient is in shortest supply, such as nitrogen or phosphorus. In other words, even if a plant has plenty of most nutrients, it can only grow as much as the scarcest nutrient allows. By combining these concepts, the researchers created a "terraced barrel" model. In this model, different limiting factors take effect sequentially as nutrients increase. This explains why both microbes and higher organisms show diminishing returns and growth slows down even when more nutrients are added, because a new limiting factor becomes dominant. Hatakeyama likens his theory to an updated version of Liebig's barrel, where a plant can only grow as much as its shortest stave (i.e., its most limited nutrient) allows. "In our model, the barrel staves spread out in steps," he explains, "each step representing a new limiting factor that becomes active as the cell grows faster." The simulations showed the predicted slowing of growth as more nutrients were added and revealed how oxygen or nitrogen levels affect growth patterns. The discovery provides a fresh perspective for looking at growth across all forms of life. Combining different principles, the global constraint principle explains complex biological behaviors without needing to model every single molecule in detail. Our work lays the groundwork for universal laws of growth. By understanding the limits that apply to all living systems, we can better predict how cells, ecosystems, and even entire biospheres respond to changing environments." It may help improve microbial production in industry, increase crop yields by pinpointing limiting nutrients, and guide predictions of ecosystem responses under changing climates. By connecting microbial biology with ecological theory, this study takes a major step towards a universal foundation for understanding the limits of life's growth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A major global trial shows that starting evolocumab early, before a first heart attack or stroke, lowers cardiovascular risk and strengthens the case for aggressive LDL cholesterol reduction in primary prevention. Study: Evolocumab in Patients without a Previous Myocardial Infarction or Stroke. In a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers assessed whether adding the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab to standard therapy reduces first major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) compared with placebo in adults with atherosclerosis or high-risk diabetes but without previous myocardial infarction or stroke. One in three adults will face heart disease, yet many have never suffered a heart attack or stroke. This raises a crucial question: could earlier, deeper low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering prevent that first cardiovascular crisis? PCSK9 inhibitors reduce LDL levels far more effectively than statins, but most supporting data come from patients with established cardiovascular disease. Investigators therefore explored whether initiating therapy earlier could improve outcomes, reduce the need for invasive procedures, and alleviate long-term health burdens. Early lipid-lowering may not only prevent acute events but also lower rates of hospitalization and intensive care admissions. Clinicians, families, and policymakers are increasingly interested in whether the earlier use of PCSK9 inhibitors could help patients maintain their health, reduce procedural demand, and preserve quality of life. Future research must further define the long-term safety, equity, and cost-effectiveness of early PCSK9-based interventions. This international, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial included adults at high cardiovascular risk without prior myocardial infarction or stroke. Participants were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either subcutaneous evolocumab 140 mg every two weeks or a matching placebo, stratified by region and baseline LDL cholesterol. Three-point MACE: coronary heart disease death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke Four-point MACE, the same, plus ischemia-driven arterial revascularization A blinded TIMI Clinical Events Committee adjudicated all outcomes. Lipid substudies measured biochemical effects, and Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The study included 12,257 participants, excluding 44 due to site irregularities. The median baseline LDL cholesterol level was 122 mg/dL, and most participants received statins, with 68% at high intensity. Evolocumab significantly reduced the risk of first cardiovascular events. Three-point MACE occurred in 336 evolocumab patients and 443 placebo patients, with a 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of 6.2% versus 8.0% (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.65–0.86; P<0.001). The four-point MACE endpoint occurred in 747 versus 907 patients (13.4% vs 16.2%; HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.73–0.89; P<0.001). Key secondary outcomes, including myocardial infarction alone (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.52–0.79), also favored evolocumab. Mortality endpoints were exploratory but numerically lower in the evolocumab group. Efficacy was consistent across age, sex, race, geography, baseline LDL cholesterol quartiles, and background use of statins or ezetimibe. Although most participants were White (93%), the treatment benefit appeared uniform. Safety profiles were comparable between groups, with no excess in serious adverse events or treatment discontinuations. Adding evolocumab to optimized background therapy significantly lowered the risk of first MACE in adults with atherosclerosis or high-risk diabetes who had not yet suffered a myocardial infarction or stroke. Benefits were consistent across key clinical subgroups and achieved without new safety signals. These findings reinforce the concept of earlier, intensive LDL cholesterol lowering to prevent initial cardiovascular crises, reduce procedural interventions, and maintain functional independence for patients while easing the burden on healthcare systems.

With previous knowledge in hand about an association between cholesterol and poor breast cancer outcomes, Nelson's team identified-with preclinical animal models-a cholesterol metabolite called hydroxycholesterol (27HC) that suppresses the ability of the immune system to attack cancer. In their latest study, Nelson's team made a significant breakthrough: a line of communication used by neutrophil-EVs stimulates breast cancer progression. Additional research collaborators from the CCIL include members Jefferson Chan and Wawrzyniec Dobrucki. In our study, we described one of the axes used by neutrophil-EVs to stimulate breast cancer progression. 27HC 'tells' neutrophils what to put into EVs before sending them out. These customized neutrophil-EVs communicate with cancer cells themselves and instruct them to change their 'makeup.' Of the research results, Nelson said, "We show that EVs from neutrophils instruct cancer cells to engage in pathways making them resistant to chemotherapies. That means, if we can disrupt this process, we can offer a solution to patients with current metastatic disease-making their current medications work better." "Given that technology allows us to diagnose breast cancer at early stages, finding a way to prevent metastatic cancer before it clinically appears-by stopping the communication of neutrophil-EVs with cancer cells-might help stop the spread of cancer cells and metastatic disease," added Krawczynska. Nelson's lab will now evaluate how they can modulate this communication to boost current breast cancer treatment strategies. This will involve intense basic science research and pre-clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of various existing compounds. In addition-given the relatively new field of EVs-they plan to collaborate with chemists to screen and develop new compounds with the potential to alter EV communication with cancer cells. Additionally, the lab will evaluate different cues from diets, drugs, or human biology that might also alter this neutrophil-EVs communication in cancer. "We want to investigate how neutrophil-EVs impact other cells directly, or via a 'telephone game' mechanism within the tumor microenvironment, influencing cancer progression," said Krawczynska. From here, Nelson's lab plans to establish collaborations with clinicians and patients to start investigating whether monitoring of EVs in the blood could predict metastatic recurrence in breast cancer patients. This project has potential to open a new way for early preventative strategies, ultimately improving cancer patients' outcomes. "Our work provides fundamental insight into how immune cells talk with cancer cells, and how that can be hijacked by a cholesterol metabolite," said Nelson of this study's significance. "This discovery offers hope, because we found that when the 'message' is eliminated, the cancer cells can revert to being more stationary and sensitive to medications, and thereby more effective," said Nelson. Neutrophils exposed to a cholesterol metabolite secrete extracellular vesicles that promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stemness in breast cancer cells.
