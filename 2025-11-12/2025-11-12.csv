            US President Trump penned a letter asking the Israeli president to grant a full pardon to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his ongoing corruption trial.
    


            In a letter distributed by the Israeli president's spokesperson, Trump wrote, “I hereby call on you to fully pardon Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a formidable and decisive War Time Prime Minister, and is now leading Israel into a time of peace.”
    


            For any other president, the letter would be an unusual intervention in the domestic politics of a foreign country. But it's only Trump's latest effort to intervene on behalf of one of his most vocal international supporters.
    


            Netanyahu faces charges of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust in three separate cases which began in Trump's first term. He has entered a plea of not guilty and maintains his innocence.
    


            “While I absolutely respect the independence of the Israeli Justice System, and its requirements, I believe that the ‘case' against Bibi, who has fought alongside me for a long time, including against the very tough adversary of Israel, Iran, is a political,  unjustified prosecution,” Trump wrote in the letter.
    


            Despite the ceremonial nature of the role, Herzog has the power to issue pardons. But the request must come from the individual accused of wrongdoing, their legal representatives or a family member. Neither Netanyahu nor any of his close associates have submitted such a petition.
    


            In a statement, Herzog's office said that he holds Trump “in high regard” and appreciates his “unwavering support of Israel, his immense contribution to the return of the hostages, the transformation of the Middle East and Gaza, and the safeguarding of Israel's security”.
    


            But Herzog's office also said that “anyone seeking a pardon must submit a request in accordance with the established procedures.”
    


            Trump has weighed in on Netanyahu's trial several times before. In June, after the 12-day war between Israel and Iran, he wrote a lengthy post on Truth Social in which he called Netanyahu's trial a “ridiculous witch hunt,” echoing language he's used about his own legal threats.
    


            And last month, during his short trip to Israel, Trump raised the issue of a pardon during his address to Israel's parliament.
    


            Turning to Herzog seated nearby, he said, “Mr. President, why don't you give him a pardon?”
    


            Trump's new letter sparked conflicting reactions across the Israeli political spectrum.
    


            Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir wrote on X: “President Herzog, listen to President Trump!”, he said, claiming that the “disgraceful” indictments against Netanyahu “have long since become an indictment against the prosecution itself.”
    


            Opposition Leader Yair Lapid responded to the letter in a statement, saying, “A reminder: Israeli law clearly stipulates that the first condition for a presidential pardon is admitting guilt and expressing remorse.”
    


            Netanyahu is the first incumbent prime minister in the history of Israel to face criminal prosecution while in office.
    


            His trial on charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust began in May 2020.
    


Controversial death penalty and foreign media bills clear first reading in Israel's parliament



            Netanyahu's own testimony started in December 2024 but has been subject to repeated delays and cancellations, the majority of them at his request. Given the remaining stages of testimony, judgment, and potential appeals, the proceedings are expected to continue for several more years.
    


            It is not the first time Trump attempted to intervene in overseas ongoing judicial proceedings.
    


            In July, in a social media post, Trump urged Brazilian authorities to end their prosecution of another international ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, who has since been convicted of plotting a coup, saying Bolsonaro was “not guilty of anything, except having fought for people.”
    


            In April, he came out in support of French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, when she was barred from running for political office for five years after being found guilty of embezzling European Union funds.
    


            “The Witch Hunt against Marine Le Pen is another example of European Leftists using Lawfare to silence Free Speech, and censor their Political Opponent, this time going so far as to put that Opponent in prison,” he posted. “It is the same ‘playbook' that was used against me.”

            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was forced Wednesday to address reports that rivals in his Labour Party are plotting to replace him as leader, just two weeks ahead of a government budget announcement that could worsen his already dire poll ratings.
    


            Several British news outlets quoted Starmer allies late Tuesday saying his job might be under immediate threat and singling out Wes Streeting, the health secretary, as a challenger whose “ambition” was being viewed with “particular suspicion.” Those same allies briefed that Starmer would fight any challenge to his leadership.
    


            Streeting dismissed the reports as “self-defeating nonsense,” telling British media that he could “not see any circumstances under which I would do that to our prime minister.” He accused those responsible for the briefings – the claims circulated to the press – of trying to “kneecap” him.
    


            By Wednesday afternoon, what might have remained as trivial political gossip had snowballed into a full-blown crisis. Accused by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch of presiding over a “toxic” culture in Downing Street, Starmer was forced to address the reports that his allies were briefing against senior members of his government.
    


            Starmer told Parliament that he had not authorized the negative briefings against his colleagues. “I appointed them to their posts because they're the best people to carry out their jobs,” he said. “Any attack on any member of my cabinet is completely unacceptable.”
    


            The latest crisis to hit the government comes ahead of a budget announcement on November 26, when Labour – in order to fill a fiscal black hole – is expected to break a key election pledge by increasing the basic rate of income tax for the first time in half a century.
    


            Chancellor Rachel Reeves has indicated that both tax rises and spending cuts are possible when she lays out her plans for the year ahead, seeking to cut government debt. That would likely spur further attacks from Nigel Farage, whose upstart anti-immigrant Reform UK party has led Labour in national polls for months.
    


            Starmer's popularity went into freefall soon after Labour won a landslide general election victory in July 2024. YouGov, a pollster, said this month that just 17% of Britons approve of the job Starmer is doing as prime minister, while 73% disapprove.
    


            The decision by Starmer's allies to brief against Streeting, the minister tasked with repairing Britain's depleted National Health Service, bewildered and blindsided many Labour Party politicians and has raised questions about the prime minister's control of his governing operation in Downing Street.
    


            “People are flummoxed,” one Labour MP, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told CNN. “Nobody quite understands where this briefing is coming from.”
    


            Lawmakers are also perplexed by the timing of the briefing. After an unsteady first 16 months in office left Starmer one of the most unpopular British prime ministers on record, Labour MPs had previously signaled that the prime minister would not face a serious leadership contest until after local elections in May 2026, giving his government time to reverse its decline in the polls.
    


Keir Starmer is polling as the UK's most unpopular prime minister on record. Where did it all go wrong?



            But the Tuesday night briefing raised the possibility that Starmer could face a leadership challenge after the budget.
    


            Despite Streeting's denial that he is seeking to challenge for the leadership of the Labour Party, a “Wes for Leader” website was created on Tuesday. CNN has asked Streeting's office for comment.
    


            Rumors of a leadership challenge last swirled in September, when Andy Burnham – a former MP and the current mayor of Greater Manchester – launched an audacious and abortive attempt at challenging Starmer's approach on the eve of Labour's annual conference.
    


            Ousting a Labour leader is difficult, however, since any challenger would need the support of 20% of the party's members of parliament, meaning 80 lawmakers would need to agree on an alternative candidate.

            In the end, there was no honeymoon period.
    


            Just two weeks ago, Japan's new prime minister Sanae Takaichi was shaking hands with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Now, relations between the two Asian nations have dramatically soured, with escalating nationalist rhetoric in China and even an apparent threat of beheading from one of its diplomats.
    


            Takaichi, who was elected as Japan's first female prime minister just last month, has become embroiled in a growing row with Beijing over Taiwan – the democratic island that China's ruling Communist Party claims as its own, and a red line it has warned other countries not to cross.
    


            The furor began when Takaichi told the Japanese parliament on November 7 that a Chinese attack on Taiwan – which lies just 60 miles (100 kilometers) from Japanese territory – would count as “a situation threatening Japan's survival” and could trigger a military response from Tokyo.
    


            Beijing has not ruled out using force to take control of the island and has ramped up the frequency and complexity of its military drills around Taiwan in recent years.
    


            Previous Japanese leaders have avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response. And Washington deliberately remains vague on how it would respond to a hypothetical invasion, a policy known as “strategic ambiguity.”
    


China warns Taiwan and human rights remain among its ‘red lines' after Trump-Xi talks



            Wading into the thorny issue of Taiwan's defense has gotten other world leaders in hot water with Beijing before. Former US President Joe Biden set off a diplomatic panic during his time in office when he said multiple times that the United States would be willing to intervene militarily if China attacked Taiwan – forcing the White House to repeatedly walk back his comments, and sparking anger each time in Beijing.
    


            Takaichi's remarks were met with an even more vehement response.
    


            “The dirty neck that sticks itself in must be cut off,” wrote the Chinese consul general in Osaka, Xue Jian, in a post on X that has since been deleted.
    


            The fallout has spiraled since, with Japan criticizing Xue's “extremely inappropriate” post and Taiwan voicing concern about Xue's “threatening” remarks, according to Reuters.
    


            Beijing, meanwhile, has defended its position and Xue's comments.
    


            A spokesperson from China's foreign ministry on Monday accused Japan of “grossly interfering with China's internal affairs,” saying Xue's post was simply responding to Takaichi's “erroneous and dangerous remarks.”
    


            For some, the controversy harks back to China's “wolf warrior” diplomacy – an aggressive style of foreign policy that emerged in the early 2020s, which often saw Chinese officials take to social media platforms to hit back directly - and often colorfully - at any criticism of China, but has since been dialed back as Beijing looked to win back lost goodwill among Western nations.
    


            And within China, where there is already significant streak of anti-Japanese sentiment, state media and other prominent voices this week have further fanned outrage over Takaichi's statement.
    


            Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily condemned Takaichi as “recklessly shooting her mouth off,” and warning: “No one should harbor any illusion that they can cross the line on the Taiwan issue without paying a price.”
    


            A social media account affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV asked: “Has her head been kicked by a donkey?”
    


            Hu Xijin, a Chinese pundit and former editor-in-chief of the state-run tabloid Global Times, offered a more violent warning, echoing the threats from the diplomat Xue.
    


            “China's battle blade for beheading invaders has been sharpened to a very keen edge,” he wrote in a post on Tuesday. “If Japanese militarism wishes to come to the Taiwan Strait to sacrifice themselves on our blades, we will fulfill them.”
    


            Takaichi said Monday that her comments were “hypothetical,” and said she would avoid making similar comments in parliament again. But the prime minister is walking a tightrope every Japanese leader has had to balance.
    


            China remains Japan's largest trading partner, and Takaichi inherited a country facing mounting economic woes. At the same time, Takaichi is known for her hardline conservative views, like her mentor former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. She has pushed to strengthen Japan's defense capacity and criticized Beijing's growing military presence in the region.
    


            This uneasy relationship was on display when Takaichi met Xi at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in late October. The two leaders agreed to build a “strategic mutually beneficial relationship,” Takaichi said afterward; however, she also raised with Xi the hot-button issue of China's activity in the East China Sea, including around islands claimed by both countries.
    


            Even before she took office, Takaichi's stance on Taiwan was clear. She visited the island earlier this year and called for cooperation on “defense challenges,” which Beijing condemned at the time. During the APEC summit, she also met with Taiwan's representative, again angering China.
    


            The current spat comes during a year when Japan-China relations are already strained, in part because of Tokyo's colonial and war-time past.
    


            September marked the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, which Beijing commemorated with a massive military parade. There's longstanding historical hostility between the two countries; China was a crucial Allied partner, fighting against Japan's full-scale invasion that ended only with Tokyo's formal surrender in 1945.
    


            The scars of that era run deep. Japanese Imperial troops killed more than 200,000 unarmed men and civilians, and raped and tortured tens of thousands of women and girls, in what is known as the Nanjing Massacre – one of the most notorious wartime atrocities of the 20th century.
    


            Ahead of the parade, Chinese officials ramped up their rhetoric and accused Japan of whitewashing history. Adding fuel to the fire, China also released at least four WWII films this year, including some that depict the Nanjing Massacre and the sinking of a Japanese vessel.
    


            Fearing a spike in anti-Japanese sentiment ahead of the parade, the Japanese embassy in Beijing warned its citizens to stay cautious and avoid speaking Japanese loudly in public – perhaps mindful that in recent years, there has been a spate of violent attacks against Japanese nationals in China.
    


            That complex history involves Taiwan, too.
    


            The island was once a Japanese colony that Imperial China had ceded to Imperial Japan. After Japan was defeated in WWII, China's ruling Nationalists took control of Taiwan – then, several years later, fled to the island and moved their seat of government there after losing a bloody civil war to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
    


            Today, the CCP views the self-ruling island as its own territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to seize it by force if necessary. Party leaders and state media have repeatedly claimed that the end of WWII marked the island's return to Chinese rule and liberation from Japanese occupation – a view Chinese officials alluded to this week as they berated Takaichi.
    


            “Japan holds historical responsibility towards the Chinese people regarding the Taiwan issue, having committed unmentionable crimes during the 50 years of colonial rule over Taiwan,” said Chen Binhua, a spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, on Wednesday when asked about Takaichi's comments.
    


            “Eighty years ago, we defeated the Japanese aggressors, restored Taiwan, and ended their occupation and plunder,” he said.
    


            “Should anyone again attempt to challenge China's core interests” or thwart reunification with Taiwan, Chen said, Beijing “will never accept or tolerate it.”

The UK has stopped sharing intelligence on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean with the US after the Pentagon began conducting lethal strikes on the vessels, CNN and The Times reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The US has killed at least 76 people in international waters since September as part of President Donald Trump's campaign against what he says are “narcoterrorists” operating out of Venezuela.

According to CNN, London suspended intelligence-sharing because it believes the strikes are illegal under international law. A UK military source told The Times: “We don't just target the vessel and kill people. We would arrest them.”

The UK had used intelligence assets stationed on its Caribbean overseas territories to help the US Coast Guard intercept vessels suspected of smuggling drugs, CNN reports.

The UN's top human rights official, Volker Turk, condemned the strikes as “extrajudicial killing.”

Venezuela and neighboring Colombia have denied that the victims were involved with cartels. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has rejected Trump's allegations that his government is profiting from the drug trade.

Trump has deployed a naval armada, including the USS Gerald R. Ford, near Venezuela's coast, hinting that he could authorize strikes on Venezuelan soil. He denies, however, that he is seeking regime change. Maduro has placed the military on alert and vowed to repel any attack.

A new species of bee has been discovered in Western Australia, named ‘Lucifer' due to the devil-like horns found on its females.

The discovery of the species, formally named Megachile (Hackeriapis) lucifer, was announced by Curtin University on Tuesday. Lead researcher Kit Prendergast said the name was inspired by the insect's appearance and the Netflix series ‘Lucifer'.

“The name just fit perfectly. I'm also a huge fan of the Netflix character Lucifer, so it was a no-brainer,” Prendergast said in a statement. “The female had these incredible little horns on her face,” she added.

Prendergast, from the university's School of Molecular and Life Sciences, first encountered the bee in 2019 during a survey of a critically endangered wildflower and was struck by its unique features, according to the study published in the Journal of Hymenoptera.

Genetic analysis revealed it was the first new species in its group to be studied in more than 20 years, Prendergast said, with DNA barcoding confirming it was a unique find not represented in any major databases or museum collections.

The function of the female's horns is still under investigation but may be related to gathering resources or nest defense, the researchers noted. The males of the species lack the distinctive horns.

The finding highlights the importance of researching native bees in ecosystems threatened by climate change and habitat disturbance, Prendergast said, adding that it “really shows how much life we still have to discover.”

She expressed hope that the discovery would raise awareness of the vast number of species still unknown to science, particularly in regions under threat from climate change and mining.

“Many mining companies still don't survey for native bees, so we may be missing undescribed species, including those that play crucial roles in supporting threatened plants and ecosystems,” she said.

The discovery comes as pollinators, which are essential for nearly all of the world's flowering plants, face severe threats. Habitat loss and climate change are pushing many vital bee species to the brink of extinction.

MOSCOW, November 12. /TASS/. The actions of the British Broadcasting Company (BBC), which distorted the statements of US President Donald Trump regarding the 2021 Capitol riots, constitute an information crime, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stated during a broadcast on Sputnik radio.

As the diplomat noted, BBC leadership has been accused of tampering with programs and censoring Trump's speeches. ""They mangled his [Trump's] speech so severely that it gave the impression he was, at the time of the broadcast, almost calling for – or at the very least approving – the events that unfolded following the election in which he competed with [Joe] Biden. That he supposedly endorsed what later occurred in and around the Capitol,"" she said.

""They were manipulating his speech by splicing it. Generally, for those who pose as a free, independent press operating under a ban on censorship, such actions constitute a monstrous crime,"" Zakharova stressed.

""I view this as a genuine information crime.

Kentucky trio oppose provision restricting hemp-derived products, with House to vote on Wednesday on funding bill

A last-minute provision in the federal spending bill heavily restricting hemp-derived products such as CBD and THC drinks could lead some Republicans to vote against the spending bill which, if passed, could end the government shutdown as early as Wednesday.

Kentucky is one of the largest producers of hemp in the country, and Republicans in the state have shown strong support for the hemp industry. Jonathan Miller, an advocate for the hemp industry and former Kentucky state treasurer, said that “Kentucky is really ground zero for the rebirth of hemp” – a niche industry until the 2018 farm bill allowed a much wider variety of legal products.

On Monday night, Kentucky senator Rand Paul broke with the Republican party and voted against the bill because of the hemp provision, which was revealed at the 11th hour and which Paul tried unsuccessfully to have removed.

Miller said Congress has been batting around provisions to ban hemp for months.

“First it was as part of the farm bill, and later was part of last year's spending bill,” Miller said. Paul successfully had the provision blocked before it found its way back into the bill. “Fast forward to November, and the deliberations behind the scenes of the appropriations bill [mean the hemp provision] has been added to the minibus” – the addition concerning spending over various sectors, including agriculture.

Senator Mitch McConnell and Congressman Andy Harris were instrumental in adding the provision, Miller said.

The current version of the provision “criminalizes any product that has more than .4 milligrams of total THC per container. That's basically zero. 95% of hemp products have more than .4 milligrams,” Miller said.

The 2018 farm bill's only restriction on hemp was that it contain less than 0.3% delta 9 THC. The new provision would ban THC in all forms, including delta 8 THC and THCA, which are common in hemp products, and would also criminalize non-intoxicating CBD products with trace amounts of THC, Miller said.

The bill will progress to a House vote as early as Wednesday, and needs 218 votes to pass. There are 219 Republican House members, but Kentucky representatives James Comer, Thomas Massie and Andy Barr have all spoken out against the ban.

Massie said, according to Louisville Public Media: “I detest the tactics that are being used to try to get the ban enacted into law.”

The alcohol industry has been divided in its lobbying for the provision. Alcohol distributors, who also distribute THC beverages, wrote a letter calling for regulation rather than an outright ban, while the American Distilled Spirits Alliance supported the ban.

Miller said that although distributors want to continue to profit from THC beverages, some alcohol manufacturers blame hemp for the recent decline in alcohol consumption among US adults.

Hemp industry leaders are worried the ban will simply turn the market over to unregulated manufacturers.

“If sweeping restrictions move forward, it won't be the bad actors who disappear,” said Jammie Treadwell, CEO of Treadwell Farms, a hemp manufacturer, adding “Instead, we need thoughtful, science-based regulation”

Evan Eneman, CEO of Iconic Tonics, which makes hemp-derived products, said the whiplash around the provision is “destabilizing and unnecessary”.

“Policy made by omnibus surprise, rather than through open hearings, invites unintended harm and fuels the very unregulated, unsafe market lawmakers claim to oppose,” he said.

The unregulated hemp market has led to problems with heavy metal, contaminants and under-age consumption.

“The good news, though, is that this bill doesn't go into effect until a year after passage, so we have a year to try to fix this, and we're hopeful to replace the ban with some strong regulations of these products,” said Miller, who expects the bill to pass.

Cameron Clarke, CEO of Kanha, which makes edibles for the regulated cannabis industry and the hemp market, said in the end, he expects politicians will have to cave to consumer demand for hemp products one way or another.

“Politicians don't typically lead consumer preferences; they follow consumer demands,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The House on Wednesday was poised to vote on legislation that would end the longest government shutdown in US history, as Democrats voice fury that the Senate-brokered compromise fails to extend expiring healthcare subsidies.

The House speaker, Mike Johnson, has instructed lawmakers to return to Washington after keeping the chamber out of session for more than 50 days.

On Monday, a splinter group of Senate Democrats joined with Republicans to advance legislation that would fund the federal government through the end of January, without extending the tax credits. The move sparked a furious backlash among Democrats, many of whom have called the plan a betrayal. Influential progressive groups have even called for Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, to resign.

All Republicans supported the measure's passage, except for Rand Paul of Kentucky, along with eight moderate members of the Democratic caucus, several of whom were recently re-elected, or serving their final terms in office.

The expected House vote, on day 42 of the shutdown, comes as hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal workers miss paychecks, millions of Americans risk losing food assistance and airlines warn travelers to brace for continued disruptions.

On Tuesday night, the House rules committee voted 8-4 along party lines to advance the Senate package, setting the stage for it to come to the House floor on Wednesday.

At the start of the hearing, the panel's top Democrat, Jim McGovern, welcomed Republicans back to Washington, decrying their absence during the shutdown.

“Where the hell have you been?” he asked, during in his opening remarks adding later: “Republicans quiet quit their jobs. They disappeared.”

Virginia Foxx, the committee's chair, blamed Democrats for causing the shut down, and noted sharply they walked away “empty handed” after insisting they would not relent until securing an extension of the enhanced healthcare subsidies.

While they did not win that concession, the senators who broke with the Democratic caucus claimed credit for getting the Republican Senate majority leader, John Thune, to agree to hold a vote by mid-December on an extension of the tax credits.

If the subsidies expire, millions of Americans could see sharp rises in their healthcare premiums or lose their marketplace coverage entirely.

The short-term government funding bill would extend government funding at current levels through January 2026 along with three year-long provisions that will fund programs at the Department of Veterans Affairs, the USDA and FDA, and legislative branch operations. The continuing resolution also includes language to stop mass federal firings and reverse dismissals that occurred during the shutdown – prohibiting additional reductions until the end of January – and guarantees back pay to workers who have spent weeks without paychecks.

Speaking Tuesday at a press conference on Capitol Hill, Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, said it was his “strong expectation” that House Democrats will vote against the proposal. He joined a group of Democratic lawmakers to unveil an amendment that would extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits for three years. The proposal was rejected by the Republican-controlled House rules committee on Tuesday night.

“Because of the Republican refusal to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits, in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis that already exists, that they failed to address, healthcare for people all across this country is on the brink of becoming unaffordable,” Jeffries said.

With a 219-member majority assuming full attendance, Johnson can only afford to lose two votes on the bill, and the Kentucky representative Thomas Massie is likely to vote no. But Republican leaders have expressed optimism that the legislation would pass on Wednesday, and be sent to Trump for his signature.

Addressing a crowd at Arlington National Cemetery on Tuesday, Veterans day, Trump congratulated Johnson, calling the Senate bill a “very big victory”.

“We're opening up our country,” he added. “Should have never been closed.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Hello, this is Kateryna Hodunova reporting from Kyiv on day 1,357 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story so far:

A large-scale assault by Russian troops in light vehicles on the city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast was ""partially successful,"" the 7th Corps of Ukraine's Air Assault Forces reported on Nov. 12.

During the defense of the city, Ukrainian forces destroyed five motorcycles and five cars on Nov. 11 and are working to eliminate firing positions the Russian army established in recent days in some neighborhoods of Pokrovsk, the report said.

The 68th Separate Jaeger Brigade, stationed in the Pokrovsk direction, also released a video on Nov. 12 showing damage to the city caused by the Russian offensive and ongoing attacks.

Russian forces are continuing attempts to strike the neighboring city of Myrnohrad, but have not yet managed to breach its fortified positions, according to the 7th Corps.

The assaults on Myrnohrad are reportedly being launched from the occupied village of Hrodivka, about 5 kilometers (3 miles) southeast of the city, with support of armored vehicles.

Russian troops are also attempting small-group infiltrations, sending two- to four-person teams to probe the southeastern outskirts of Myrnohrad daily.

Last updated 6:29 p.m. Kyiv time.

Delivering humanitarian aid to civilians in Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad has become impossible due to the threat of ongoing Russian attacks, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on Nov. 12.

""It is impossible to reach the people who are there. It is impossible to deliver drinking water, humanitarian aid, or medicine,"" Filashkin said.

Some 1,253 people remain in Pokrovsk, and 1,350 remain in Myrnohrad.

Only local Ukrainian military personnel are still able to provide assistance to civilians remaining in Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, according to the governor. 

Last updated 5:31 p.m. Kyiv time.

Ukraine is facing increasingly intense Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure, while civilian casualties remain high, according to a U.N. monthly report published on Nov. 12.

Three large-scale attacks on Oct. 10, 22, and 30 targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, triggering emergency power outages across most regions of the country, the report read.

Russian attacks killed at least 148 civilians and injured another 929 in October. The majority of casualties,  around 65%, occurred in front-line regions, particularly in Kherson, Kharkiv, and Donetsk oblasts.

Civilian casualties from January to October 2025 are 27% higher than during the same period last year, and the total number of deaths and injuries in the first ten months of 2025 has already surpassed the figures for all of 2024.

Last updated 5:30 p.m. Kyiv time.

Russia has established the Unmanned Systems Forces, Russian state media reported on Nov. 12.

""Operational regiments and other units have been formed,"" Sergey Ishtuganov, the deputy head of the new unit, said in an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda.

""Combat work of the unmanned systems units is being carried out following a single plan and in cooperation with other units in battlegroups,"" he added.

A separate branch of Ukraine's Armed Forces dedicated to unmanned systems was formed in 2024.

Andrii Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation, said that Russia ""copied (Ukraine's) successful approaches"" as Ukraine's Armed Forces drone units are now operating ""very effectively.""

Last updated 3:17 p.m. Kyiv time.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has exposed an alleged Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) agent from Crimea who was planning a series of terrorist attacks in Kyiv, the agency said on Nov. 12.

According to the investigation, the plan involved explosions in Kyiv's large shopping and entertainment centers, and in one of the capital's metro stations.

The suspect, a Crimean resident, began working for the FSB after the occupation of the peninsula in 2014. He searched for ""like-minded people"" to be recruited by the FSB, including Ukrainian citizens from the occupied territory who were not subject to mobilization in Ukraine due to their age.

Kyiv City Prosecutor's Office reported on Nov. 12 that a 55-year-old resident of Crimea, the alleged organizer of terrorist attacks, has been charged in absentia.

Last updated 2:54 p.m. Kyiv time.

Ukrainian forces withdrew from its positions near the village of Rivnopillia in northeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast late on Nov. 11, Ukraine's Southern Defense Forces reported.

Ukrainian troops pulled back from Rivnopillia to more ""defensible positions to safeguard the lives of their personnel,"" according to the Southern Defense Forces.

At the same time, the advance of Russian forces in this sector has been halted, though heavy fighting continues in other areas along the line, the report said.

In the Oleksandrivka and Huliaipole sectors, the Russian army continues mass strikes and has stepped up assault operations near the settlements of Pryvilne, Zelenyi Hai, Rivnopillia, Pavlivka, Vorone, Stepove, and Novopavlivske.

""While attempting to advance, the enemy has suffered heavy losses. In the past day alone, 58 (Russian) personnel were killed and nearly three dozen wounded,"" the report read.

Last updated 2:22 p.m. Kyiv time.

Soldiers from the 28th Separate Mechanized Brigade have foiled a Russian attempt to break through toward the city of Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast, the brigade said on Nov. 12 on Telegram.

The Russian army attempted to use foggy weather and low visibility to penetrate Kostiantynivka and its outskirts, deploying additional personnel for a potential breakthrough. Yet Ukrainian forces detected the movement in time and launched a counterattack.

The brigade did not provide details on the time or location of the fighting.

""The enemy's losses were significant. Some groups retreated, while others remained in the fields,"" the brigade said. ""Their equipment was also damaged, so there will be fewer vehicles to attack with next time.""

Last updated 2:05 p.m. Kyiv time.

Three Russian Geran-2 drones struck the Holodnohirskyi district in central Kharkiv, injuring five people, on Nov. 12, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported.

Four of the injured were hospitalized.

The attack also damaged a civilian enterprise and nearby buildings, according to Syniehubov.

Last updated 12:13 p.m. Kyiv time.

Ukraine's Special Operations Forces confirmed its ""successful fire attack"" on the Stavrolen petrochemical enterprise, a Lukoil-owned petrochemical complex in Budyonnovsk, southern Russia, overnight on Nov. 12.

Drones of the Deep Strike unit of Special Operations Forces attacked an industrial zone in Budyonnovsk.

""Numerous explosions and a fire were recorded in the target area. The results of the strike are being clarified,"" Ukraine's General Staff said.

Supernova+, a well-known Ukrainian Telegram channel, posted video footage of the attack, saying that there were ""at least three direct hits"" on the Stavrolen petrochemical plant facilities. Local residents also reported explosions.

Russia is deploying additional forces near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast due to a shortage of reserves, the Atesh partisan group reported on Nov. 12.

Russian military equipment and personnel are moving toward Pokrovsk on a daily basis, likely from the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia directions, according to the group.

""The Russian army appears to have depleted both its main forces and operational reserves for continuing the offensive, leaving it no choice but to expose other parts of the front,"" the group said.

Agents from the 506th Russian Motorized Rifle Regiment, operating in the Pokrovsk direction, informed the group that hundreds of soldiers are arriving at their position daily. 

The newly arrived troops are reportedly being sent straight into assault operations, sometimes without even being formally registered with the regiment.

At least two people have been killed and 13 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Nov. 12.

Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 90 out of the 121 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys launched by Russia overnight, according to the Air Force. Thirty-one drone strikes occurred at 19 locations. The fall of the drone debris was recorded at one location.

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian drones attacked the Synelnykove district, killing a 47-year-old man, according to Governor Vladyslav Haivanenko.

Romania aims to take control over the local subsidiary of Russia's Lukoil in order to protect its national energy system and comply with U.S. sanctions, Romanian Energy Minister Bogdan Ivan said on Nov. 11.

Lukoil operates 320 gas stations in Romania, manages the Petrotel refinery (which supplies about a quarter of the country's fuel market), and holds exploration rights in a section of the Black Sea.

The company, alongside Rosneft, was recently targeted by U.S. sanctions linked to Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, set to take effect on Nov. 21.

Ivan said Romania would not seek an extension of the sanctions deadline, adding that Bucharest supports enforcement of the recent U.S. measures. “I will support fully applying sanctions initiated by the United States at the level of the entire European Union,"" he said.

He noted that the Energy Ministry is drafting legislation to maintain refinery operations and fuel supply stability while complying with sanctions.

The government has yet to clarify which of Lukoil's assets would be taken under state control or how the process would unfold. 

Lukoil and Rosneft are critical parts of Russia's economy. Kyiv has long encouraged its allies to sanction Russia's energy sector, arguing that depriving Moscow of oil revenues would limit its ability to finance its war against Ukraine.

Editor's note: The article is being updated.

Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko and Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk submitted their resignation on Nov. 12 amid a large-scale corruption scandal, Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said. 

She added that she had submitted their resignation requests to the Ukrainian parliament. 

Earlier on Nov. 12, President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Hrynchuk and Halushchenko to resign. Halushchenko had been suspended from the job of justice minister earlier the same day. 

Halushchenko is being investigated by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) as part of a large-scale corruption case into state nuclear power company Energoatom involving Timur Mindich, a close associate of Zelensky. He has not been officially charged yet. 

Meanwhile, Hrynchuk spent three nights in Halushchenko's apartment in July and August, an anti-corruption prosecutor said at a court hearing on Nov. 12. 

When asked by the Slidstvo.info investigative journalism project, Hrynchuk said she ""has not heard about it."" She has denied the accusations of wrongdoing. 

A prosecutor also said at a court hearing on Nov. 12 that Ihor Myroniuk, a suspect in the corruption case, had conducted a job interview for Hrynchuk when she was considered for the position of energy minister.

""I believe that the justice minister and the energy minister cannot remain in their positions,"" Zelensky said on Telegram. ""This is, among other things, a matter of trust. If there are accusations, they must be addressed.""

Zelensky added that he had asked Svyrydenko to ""ensure that these ministers submit resignation letters"" and asked the Ukrainian parliament to support their resignations. 

He also said that the National Security and Defense Council would sanction two people implicated in the Energoatom corruption case. 

""Right now, things are extremely difficult for everyone in Ukraine — enduring power outages, Russian strikes, and losses,"" Zelensky added. ""It is absolutely unacceptable that, on top of this, there are still some (corruption) schemes in the energy sector.""

An extraordinary meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers has suspended Halushchenko and appointed Lyudmila Suhak, deputy justice minister for European integration, as acting justice minister, Svyrydenko said on Telegram.

Halushchenko said on Facebook on Nov. 12 that he had spoken with Svyrydenko.

""I fully agree: a political decision needs to be made first, and only then should we deal with all the details,"" he added. “I am not clinging to the position of minister and will not cling to it. I believe that suspension during the investigation is a civilized and proper course of action. I will defend myself in the legal domain and prove my position.”

Meanwhile, Halushchenko's critics argued that suspension was not sufficient. 

“The suspension of the justice minister by the Cabinet is not enough. Two ministers must either resign or be dismissed from their positions by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine,"" Anastasia Radina, head of the Ukrainian parliament's anti-corruption committee, wrote on Facebook in an apparent reference to Halushchenko and Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk. 

Halushchenko was energy minister from 2021 to 2025 and was appointed justice minister in July. 

The NABU searched premises linked to Halushchenko as part of the Energoatom investigation on Nov. 10. 

Halushchenko, who is sometimes identified as ""energy minister"" and sometimes by the code name ""Professor,"" features in audio recordings published by the NABU. 

In the NABU tapes, suspects Ihor Myroniuk and Dmytro Basov appear to divide kickbacks between themselves and ""Professor"" — an alleged reference to Halushchenko.

""We will (divide) it by three: you, me and Professor,"" Myroniuk said in the recordings. 

Myroniuk, who has also been charged in the case, is a former advisor to Halushchenko.

Anti-corruption prosecutor Serhiy Savytskyi said at a court hearing on Nov. 11 that Mindich had allegedly committed his crimes by unlawfully influencing Halushchenko.

In the tapes, there is a conversation between Mindich and Halushchenko.

Mindich also discusses receiving money from another suspect, Oleksandr Tsukerman, in the recordings. The Anti-Corruption Bureau said that the conversation took place after Halushchenko visited the President's Office.

An anti-corruption prosecutor said at a court hearing on Nov. 12 that, according to the NABU tapes, Zelensky had called Halushchenko during a conversation between the minister, Mindich and Tsukerman. The president allegedly made the call after Mindich sent him a message.

The prosecutor argued that the episode proves Mindich's political influence. Zelensky's press service did not respond to a request for comment. 

Halushchenko had been involved in several corruption scandals even before the ongoing Energoatom case.

In 2024, he was summoned to the Verkhovna Rada for a report on corruption in the energy sector.

The same year, the NABU charged Halushchenko's deputy Oleksandr Heilo with receiving a $500,000 bribe and his former deputy Maksym Nemchynov with corruption in the energy industry. 

Halushchenko, 52, is from Lviv in western Ukraine. He has a law degree from Lviv State University and a management degree from the Ukrainian Foreign Commerce Academy. 

He was the executive director for legal support at Energoatom from 2013 to 2014 and a vice president at the company from 2020 to 2021. 

Halushchenko has also taught law at Kyiv National University's International Relations Institute.

A carrier ship docked at LNG Canada's export facility in Kitimat, B.C., on Aug. 19.Jesse Winter/Reuters

A wave of liquefied natural gas development is set to double global supplies by the end of the decade, with around 300 billion cubic metres of new annual export capacity scheduled to come online, according to a new analysis from the International Energy Agency. 

That's the largest ever global addition to LNG capacity, some of which will come from Canada. 

The new LNG Canada terminal in Kitimat, B.C., only began exporting the fuel in June. But the country's trajectory for natural gas production – set to rise by roughly 35 billion cubic metres (bcm) to 250 bcm by 2035 – puts it on course to cement its “entrance to the club of LNG exporters,” said the IEA's World Energy Outlook 2025, released Thursday. 

Natural gas has been a focus for the federal government as part of Prime Minister Mark Carney's bid to make Canada an energy superpower. Expansion of the LNG Canada facility was on the first list of projects that will be reviewed for fast-track approval under Ottawa's Building Canada Act; on Monday, Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne called the project a “game changer.” 

LNG Canada project underlines change in public opinion on energy sector, Champagne says

In its 2025 report, the Paris-based IEA outlined outcomes under three scenarios: current policies, stated policies and policies put in place to bring emissions to net-zero by 2050. 

Under current government policies, the new supply of LNG will be absorbed “relatively quickly by robust increases in demand,” the report said. Similarly, under stated policies, a well-supplied global gas market remains into the 2030s. 

In the net-zero scenario, however, global demand and prices are much lower. Both will remain significantly below 2024 levels by 2035 as the rapid expansion of renewables and electrification limits gas demand growth, despite abundant availability of the fossil fuel.

Common among all scenarios, however, is that the world will have ample supplies of oil and gas in the near term, owing to a “quintet of producers in the Americas – the United States, Canada, Guyana, Brazil and Argentina – and muted demand growth,” the report said.

Tony Keller: Does Canada need a new oil pipeline? Maybe. More LNG? Definitely

The world's growing need for energy, particularly for emerging economies in India and Southeast Asia, is also set to continue under all scenarios.

Countries in those regions will increasingly shape energy market dynamics in the years ahead, the report said. They are set to take the baton from China, which has accounted for half of global oil and gas demand growth and 60 per cent of electricity demand growth since 2010. 

But the surging demand for energy of all kinds comes amid an uncertain geopolitical landscape, which could place the security of supplies in a precarious spot. 

“When we look at the history of the energy world in recent decades, there is no other time when energy security tensions have applied to so many fuels and technologies at once,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a statement. 

With energy security front and centre for many governments, he said, responses need to consider affordability, access, competitiveness and climate change in a data-driven way. 

That's particularly true for electricity. 

Opinion: Canada, don't make the same mistake with LNG that Australia did

The annual report has for years flagged increasing global demand for electricity, but in 2025, it said that demand has reached “breakneck growth” owing to surging investment in data centres – a sector expected to reach US$580-billion in 2025. 

“In a break from the trend of the past decade, the increase in electricity consumption is no longer limited to emerging and developing economies,” Dr. Birol said.

“Those who say that ‘data is the new oil' will note that this surpasses the US$540-billion being spent on global oil supply – a striking example of the changing nature of modern economies.”

Yet the world continues to fall short on action to avoid the worst effects of climate change, the analysis found; even with rapid action to reduce emissions, the planet is set to surpass 1.5 degrees of warming, failing the target laid out in the Paris Agreement. 

On a more hopeful note, the report said there is still scope to avoid the worst climate outcomes, if the world reaches net-zero emissions by mid-century. Doing so would bring temperatures back below 1.5 degrees in the long term, it said.

The House of Representatives will try to end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history on Wednesday, with a vote on a stopgap funding package to restart disrupted food assistance, pay hundreds of thousands of federal workers and revive a hobbled air-traffic control system. 

Republicans currently hold a narrow 219-213 majority in the House. But President Donald Trump's support for the bill is expected to keep his party together in the face of vehement opposition from House Democrats, who are angry that a long standoff launched by their Senate colleagues failed to secure a deal to extend federal health insurance subsidies.

Eight Senate Democrats on Monday broke with party leadership to pass the funding package, which would extend funding through Jan. 30, leaving the federal government on a path to keep adding about US$1.8-trillion a year to its US$38-trillion in debt.

U.S. Speaker Mike Johnson faces rebellious House as lawmakers return for shutdown vote

“My urgent plea of all my colleagues in the House – that means every Democrat in the House – is to think carefully, pray and finally do the right thing,” Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who kept his chamber in recess for nearly two months as a pressure tactic in shutdown negotiations, told reporters. 

House Democrats remain adamantly opposed, angered by the Senate deal that came less than a week after Democrats won high-profile elections in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City that many thought strengthened their odds of winning an extension of health insurance subsidies. While the deal sets up a December vote on those subsidies in the Senate, Johnson has made no such promise in the House.

“Donald Trump and Republicans believe the affordability crisis in America is made up. That's why these extremists haven't done a damn thing to lower the high cost of living. You deserve better,” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a social media posting on Wednesday. If approved by the House, the funding package would have to be signed into law by Trump, who heralded Senate passage as “a very big victory” on Tuesday.

Political analysts representing both the Republican and Democratic viewpoints agree that a government shutdown is a bipartisan failure to the people, but think opposing parties should shoulder more of the blame.

The return of the House also means that Johnson could soon face a vote to release all unclassified records related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, something he and Trump have resisted up to now.

Johnson on Wednesday will swear in Democrat Adelita Grijalva, who won a September special election to fill the Arizona seat of her late father, Raul Grijalva. She is expected to provide the final signature needed for a petition to force a House vote on the issue. That means that after performing its constitutionally mandated duty of keeping the government funded, the House could once again be consumed by a probe into Trump's former friend whose life and 2019 death in prison have spawned countless conspiracy theories. 

The funding package also contains three full-year appropriations bills to fund military construction, agriculture programs including food assistance for lower-income Americans and legislative branch operations.

Analysis: The end of the U.S. government shutdown is the result of a fraught compromise

The package would allow eight Republican senators to seek hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages for alleged privacy violations stemming from the federal investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump's supporters. It retroactively makes it illegal in most cases to obtain a senator's phone data without disclosure and allows those whose records were obtained to sue the Justice Department for US$500,000 in damages, along with attorneys' fees and other costs.

“Not a cent for health care, but Republicans wrote in a corrupt cash bonus of at least $500k each for 8 GOP Senators,” Senator Patty Murray, top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a social media posting. 

The funding vote is expected late on Wednesday, and is likely to face some token Republican opposition, from Representative Thomas Massie, a Kentucky hardliner who opposed an initial House funding package in September along with fellow Representative Victoria Spartz of Indiana. 

But the hardline House Freedom Caucus, often a stumbling block to spending bills, is not expected to attempt to block it, said Representative Andy Harris of Maryland, the group's chairman, who added, “I believe we're all going to be on board with this.” 

The pace of airline ticket sales for Thanksgiving travel has slowed as more travellers have reconsidered whether to fly amid all the delays and cancellations.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen is questioning why the Trump administration sent money to Equatorial Guinea, which she describes as one of the world's most corrupt countries.Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images

The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has made a “highly unusual” payment of US$7.5-million to the small oil-rich country of Equatorial Guinea in a covert deal allowing Washington to send deported migrants there, a Democratic senator says.

Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democratic senator on the Senate foreign relations committee, disclosed the payment in a letter this week and questioned why the Trump administration was transferring U.S. money to what she describes as one of the world's most corrupt countries.

Equatorial Guinea has been ruled for 46 years by President Teodoro Obiang, who seized power in a military coup. His son and vice-president, known as Teodorin or Teddy, has made headlines for his playboy lifestyle and expensive spending habits, including his purchases of luxury yachts, Ferrari sports cars, a Malibu mansion and a US$275,000 jewel-studded glove that once belonged to Michael Jackson.

Despite the country's vast oil and gas wealth, its multibillion-dollar assets are monopolized by a small elite, while two-thirds of its 1.5 million people live below the poverty line of about US$2 a day. Critics of the government, including civil-society activists, have often been arrested and imprisoned.

In her letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio this week, Ms. Shaheen expressed “serious concerns” about the deportation deal and asked whether the administration has done anything to ensure that the money will not facilitate corruption, human trafficking or human rights abuses.

The agreement with Equatorial Guinea is the latest in a series of Trump administration deals with African and Latin American governments, in which they agree to accept deportees from the United States who are citizens of other countries. But the deal with Equatorial Guinea is a rare case where a U.S. politician has disclosed details of the payment.

The administration has not commented publicly on the agreement, but Ms. Shaheen said the payment was made directly to Equatorial Guinea's government by the U.S. State Department.

She called it a “stark departure” from previous U.S. assistance to the African country, which hasn't climbed above US$2-million annually in recent years. The latest payment “would far exceed the amount of U.S. foreign assistance provided over the last eight years combined,” she said in the letter.

Trump faces backlash over African deportation deals

Ms. Shaheen said the payment was financed by the U.S. government's migration and refugee program – the first time such funds have been given directly to a foreign government, rather than to a non-governmental group.

Human rights groups have criticized the Trump administration's deals with foreign countries, noting that the deported migrants often lose their access to legal counsel and end up isolated in remote prisons without any way to seek release.

Most of the African countries that have struck deportation deals with the Trump administration are authoritarian regimes such as South Sudan, Rwanda and the kingdom of Eswatini.

Ms. Shaheen, in her letter to Mr. Rubio, said she is worried that any migrants deported to Equatorial Guinea could be sent to Black Beach prison, an island jail that is widely known as one of Africa's most feared prisons, notorious for its brutal conditions.

She also quoted the U.S. State Department's latest report on human trafficking, which described bribery in Equatorial Guinea's judicial system and the involvement of senior officials in exploiting women and girls in human trafficking crimes.

Rwanda will accept up to 250 deportees from the U.S. under Trump's third-country program

Teodorin Obiang, seen as the likely successor to his 83-year-old father as the country's president, regularly flaunts his lavish lifestyle on Instagram, where he posts photos of himself at European beach resorts or on private jets.

In a case in France in 2017, he was convicted of embezzling and laundering tens of millions of euros. Many of his assets have been seized by authorities in Switzerland and France after corruption investigations, and he is under sanctions or visa restrictions in several countries, including the United States and Britain, because of the graft cases.

Ms. Shaheen, in her letter, noted that the U.S. Justice Department had filed a civil asset forfeiture case against Teodorin Obiang in 2011 after determining that he had amassed more than US$300-million in assets from corruption and money laundering. The department eventually reached a deal to seize nearly US$30-million in assets from him – including some of his Michael Jackson memorabilia.

Despite the sanctions and asset seizures, senior U.S. officials have been keen to curry favour with Teodorin Obiang, holding several meetings with him in recent years. They have been seeking to counteract Chinese influence in Equatorial Guinea, where China reportedly wants to build a naval base – its first on the Atlantic Ocean.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Germany news: Google plans data center in Hesse","https://www.dw.com/en/germany-news-google-plans-data-center-in-hesse/live-74695204","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 00:05:47 GMT","

Tech giant Google intends to build a data center just south of Germany's finance capital Frankfurt am Main. This project is part of Google's plans to invest €5.5 billion ($6.4 billion) in Germany.

Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil has been busy! He joined Google country manager Phillip Justus in announcing plans to build a data center in western Germany's Hesse.

The plans will come as part of Google's largest-ever investment in cloud infrastructure in Germany .

Meanwhile, a Saudi-born doctor accused of carrying out a deadly car attack on the Christmas market in the eastern city of Magdeburg has said he was ""as cold as ice"" on the day.

He has said he wishes to testify ""for hours, perhaps days"" from Tuesday as his trial continues.

Six people were killed and more than 300 injured in the December 20, 2024, attack.

The 51-year-old is charged on six counts of murder and 338 counts of attempted murder.

Meanwhile, Chancellor Friedrich Merz is celebrating his 70th birthday as his coalition government turns in increasingly dismal popularity ratings.

This blog is now closed. Below are headlines and analyses covering issues from and about Germany on Tuesday, November 11. For the latest on Germany on Wednesday, November 12, follow our blog here.

Germany and California have agreed to deepen cooperation on climate action and renewable energy, according to the Environment Ministry.

The ""Joint Statement on Climate and Energy Cooperation"" between Baden-Württemberg and California was signed at the UN climate summit in Brazil.

California Governor Gavin Newsom and Jochen Flasbarth, Germany's environment state secretary, presided over the signing.

""California and Germany have been standing side by side for years when it comes to understanding climate protection as a necessary driver of innovation,"" Flasbarth said.

The partnership will focus on green technology, renewable energy, and strategies to adapt to climate change.

""Together, we want to show that progress, innovation, and climate protection go hand in hand,"" Flasbarth said. 

Newsom criticized US President Donald Trump's decision to reverse the US government's course on climate action.

""The United States of America is as dumb as we want to be on this topic, but the state of California is not. And so we are going to assert ourselves, we're going to lean in, and we are going to compete in this space,"" he said.

Alice Weidel, co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, has criticized her own party members for agreeing to travel to Russia amid allegations of espionage and ties to the Kremlin.

Several AfD politicians plan to attend a symposium this week in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, a move that has drawn sharp backlash in Germany amid strained relations with Moscow.

""I cannot understand what they are actually supposed to do there, to put it bluntly,"" Weidel told reporters on Tuesday.

The trip comes as lawmakers from other parties, including the conservative head of Germany's intelligence oversight committee, accused AfD members of effectively spying for Russia by submitting extensive parliamentary inquiries on sensitive security topics.

The Sochi visit was repeatedly mentioned in a parliamentary debate over those allegations. A meeting with former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, a vocal supporter of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, had reportedly been planned but was later canceled on party orders.

Weidel, who has tried to position the AfD as a mainstream political force, defended its more conciliatory stance toward Moscow but said the trip offers ""very little to be gained.""

A major trial has begun in western Germany against ten defendants accused of running a human trafficking and prostitution network that brought women and transgender people from Thailand to Germany.

Prosecutors say the victims were forced to work in brothels to repay travel debts and were controlled through financial coercion. The defendants, aged between 29 and 64, face charges including organized human trafficking, forced prostitution, and money laundering.

According to investigators, the suspects held various roles in the network — from arranging travel and managing finances to transporting victims and running brothels, mainly in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

Authorities said some of the profits were smuggled to Thailand in cash. In one case, €110,000 ($127,500) was flown from Hamburg Airport hidden inside packets of sweets.

Most defendants are Thai. Several hold European passports, including one German national. 

The Bielefeld Regional Court has set hearings through April 2026.

German police have uncovered a professional laboratory for synthetic drug production in the state of Lower Saxony and arrested several suspects in a joint operation with Dutch authorities, officials said Tuesday.

The illegal facility was discovered in northwestern Germany near the Dutch border and is believed to have been operated by a gang made up mostly of Dutch nationals.

Four suspects were provisionally detained in Germany, and another was arrested on an outstanding warrant. In the Netherlands, three additional suspects were detained under German warrants, police said.

During coordinated raids at eight sites in Lower Saxony and nine in the Netherlands, officers seized 130 liters (about 35 gallons) of an amphetamine precursor — equivalent to the total amount seized across Germany in all of 2024.

Investigators estimate the material could yield about 1.5 million doses with a street value in the tens of millions of euros. Specialized police units discovered the now-unused lab during the raids.

Authorities said the investigation has been underway since December 2024, involving close cooperation between German and Dutch police as well as Europol.

The multinational tech giant Google said on Tuesday that it plans to build a data center in Dietzbach, just south of Frankfurt am Main in Germany. German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil joined the announcement.

The data center will be part of Google's wider investment in cloud infrastructure in Germany, which Reuters reported will also include projects using renewables and waste heat.

Overall, Google plans to invest a record-breaking €5.5 billion ($6.4 billion) in Germany by 2029, making this what Google has said will be its largest-ever investment in the country.

In a push to reduce the country's carbon footprint, German law requires that around two thirds of heat in newly installed heating systems must be derived from renewable sources or unavoidable waste heat.

Germany opened the doors to its very first Google data center in 2023. The center in Hanau, just east of Frankfurt am Main, will now reportedly be expanded as part of Google's investment scheme, as the regional German paper Hessenschau reported.  

Germany's chemical sector, which is widely seen as a barometer of the country's general economic health, is currently stagnant at a three-decade low, a group representing the chemical and pharmaceutical industries said on Tuesday.

The sector, which includes major German companies such as BASF and Bayer, is ""struggling on all fronts,"" according to Wolfgang Grosse Entrup, head of the VCI association

""Production, sales, prices... everything is in the red,"" he told a press conference.

Grosse Entrup said chemical production was languishing around levels seen in 1995, with only some 70% of chemical plant capacity in use.

Quarterly sales to the US were down some 20% and those to Asia about 12% from the same period in the previous year, according to the VCI.

The pharmaceutical sector was in better shape, with production having risen from a year earlier, but unpredictable US tariff policy had led to diminished confidence there as well, the group said.

Grosse Entrup said the coalition government under Chancellor Friedrich Merz, which took power in May on the back of promises to boost the ailing economy, had so far failed to ""generate a spirit of optimism in industry.""

""The economy is still stagnating. There is a lack of a convincing strategy that can restore confidence and get Germany back on track,"" he said.

The Saudi doctor standing trial over the Christmas market car attack in Magdeburg last year has confessed to the deed and described his feelings and motivation before the court.

He told the court that his dealings with German authorities and their lack of support for Saudi women had motivated him to carry out the attack, in which six people died and 338 were injured.

He said he had wanted to inform and warn the authorities, and had made criminal complaints that were not acted upon.

""There were only two paths to take,"" he said. ""Either I leave Germany or I attack.""

He said he had been ""as cold as ice"" on the day of the attack and had had the feeling that he was ""doing something terrible.""

""At the last moment, I saw there was no hope,"" he said, adding that he was sure the police would shoot him.

The 51-year-old accused was instead arrested just minutes after the attack on December 20, 2024, and has been in pre-trial detention since then.

Afghans living in Germany are concerned that representatives from the Taliban regime are now working in diplomatic posts in the country, the head of a project supporting single mothers from Afghanistan and their children has said.

Zohra Soori-Nurzad told public broadcaster WDR that the presence of representatives from the radical Islamist group at diplomatic missions, including the Afghan Consulate General in Bonn, was a ""great risk and danger"" to Afghans, some of whom have fled from the Taliban's oppressive measures, particularly against women.

She said Afghans might find it more difficult to apply for passports or advance their asylum proceedings.

According to Soori-Nurzad, who runs the aid project ""Stitching for Life,"" it was also dangerous if members of the Taliban gained access to sensitive data, as this could be used against people coming from Afghanistan.

She said Afghans currently residing in Germany were for this reason ""very frightened"" to contact the consulate.

Soori-Nurzad also said it could not be ruled out that the Taliban regime would use the consulate for secret service activities.

The German Foreign Ministry told the epd news agency that although the Afghan diplomatic missions in Germany were led by people sent by the country before the Taliban's return to power in August 2021, the government had permitted two new staff to be sent by Kabul, one to Bonn and one to Berlin.

It said that the German government ""had an interest in seeking that Afghan missions in Germany continue to be operative and that Afghan nationals in German receive adequate consular care.""

This included the issuance of travel documents, it said.

The Taliban regime in Afghanistan remains officially unrecognized by almost all countries around the world, including Germany, with Russia the only nation to have so far reinstated formal diplomatic ties.

Germany has, however, held talks ""at a technical level"" with the Taliban over issues such as deporting Afghans who have committed crimes

A German-Polish man has been arrested in the western German city of Dortmund on suspicion of having issued calls to attack politicians and offering rewards for doing so, federal prosecutors said on Tuesday.

They said the man, identified only as Martin S. under German privacy laws, also published instructions on the darknet for manufacturing explosives, while calling for donations in cryptocurrency that were to be used as rewards for carrying out such attacks.

The suspect, who prosecutors said was detained on Monday, is also alleged to have included a list with names and personal details of politicians and public figures on his platform, along with self-formulated death sentences.

The man, who has been accused of financing terrorism, instigating violence aimed at undermining the state and dangerous publication of personal details, is to come before the Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe on Tuesday, the prosecutors said.

The court will decide on whether and how the man should be detained ahead of a likely trial.

November 11 in Germany marks both the start of the boisterous Carnival season and the day on which the Catholic St. Martin and the legend about his sharing his cloak with a beggar are remembered with children's lantern parades.

US-based artificial intelligence giant OpenAI lost a case in a Munich court over its use of German song lyrics under copyright. 

German national music rights association GEMA had brought the suit, arguing that the German ChatGPT large language model (LLM) had been partially trained on at least 100,000 stolen songs.

In the US, writers and musicians have decried their work being stolen to train ChatGPT, and accused OpenAI of deleting its datasets to obfuscate ts source material.

OpenAI is in the midst of a controversial deal with German software giant SAP to create a Germany-based AI data center.

While SAP claims it has been granted ""full sovereignty"" over the data, observers worry the process hasn't been made transparent enough to ensure that the US won't gain access to private German data.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz turns 70 on Tuesday, with a celebration planned by his Christian Democrats (CDU) in the late afternoon before the German leader marks the occasion with his wife, Charlotte, his children and grandchildren.

Merz himself has said he is not going to make a fuss about the occasion and that Tuesday will be a ""normal working day.""

""A great advantage of aging is that you become more philosophical and learn to tell what is important and what is not,"" he said.

He has also said that he is ""grateful to be fit and healthy and to be able to concentrate completely on my task as chancellor.""

Not everyone in Germany is of the opinion, however, that his age is not a hindrance, with 52% of respondents in a survey by the Forsa polling institute for private broadcaster RTL saying it would be better if he were younger.

The same poll showed a slump in his popularity, with just 18% saying they would welcome it if he ran for chancellor again in 2029.

This comes as the coalition government he leads, with the Social Democrats (SPD) as junior partner, comes under growing criticism amid infighting, rows over policy and its seeming failure to boost the ailing economy.

Merz is the first German chancellor to turn 70 in office since his CDU predecessor Konrad Adenauer, the first person to hold the position in the postwar Federal Republic of Germany.

Adenauer became chancellor at 73 in 1949 and remained in the post until 1963, when he was 87.

Taleb A.*, the Saudi-born doctor accused of the deadly attack on the Christmas market in the eastern city of Magdeburg on December 20 last year, has announced that he wants to testify for ""hours, perhaps days"" as his trial enters its second day.

He has also said he intends to answer questions put to him by the Magdeburg regional court.

Taleb A. has already admitted to being the driver of the car that ran into passersby at a pedestrian crossing before slamming into crowds at the market, killing six people and injuring more than 300 more.

The 51-year-old has been charged on six counts of murder and 338 counts of attempted murder.

So far, the Christmas market in Magdeburg has not received permission to take place amid criticisms of its security concept.

However, city officials hope that it can go ahead from November 20 as planned after improvements have been made.

The outcome of Bihar Legislative Assembly elections could reflect Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity and his alliance's influence in the key state.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance, or NDA, is poised to return to power in Bihar, according to several exit polls.

Phase one of voting for a new Legislative Assembly in Bihar, in eastern India, took place on November 6, the second phase wrapped up on Tuesday.

Official results are expected on Friday in the state, long seen as India's political bellwether.

Bihar is part of a politically crucial heartland region for Modi's NDA, and the vote comes ahead of key state polls in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Assam in the run-up to national elections in 2029. Bihar sends 40 lawmakers to Parliament's lower house, and a win in the state could strengthen Modi's coalition.

The state recorded its highest voter turnout at 66.91%, according to Election Commission data.

If the polls are accurate, the NDA coalition is expected to secure well over the majority mark of 122 seats in the 243-member state assembly. The opposition Mahagathbandhan alliance, led by the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress party, is predicted to win fewer seats.

Congress member of Parliament Tariq Anwar told the ANI news agency the polls ""cannot be considered accurate.""

""They are only a speculation. It indicates what might happen. It would not be right to think that they are accurate,"" he said.

But BJP leader Syed Shahnawaz said the exit polls showed, ""People have voted for Prime Minister Modi, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and development.""

			US president accuses the broadcaster of dishonestly ‘butchering' the address he made before the 2021 Capitol riots

Donald Trump has said he has an “obligation” to sue the BBC for doctoring his speech the day of the Capitol Hill riot to make it sound “radical”.

In his first public remarks since announcing he planned to sue the broadcaster, the US president accused the BBC of dishonestly “butchering” his Jan 6 2021 address and “defrauding” the public.

The Telegraph disclosed last week that Panorama spliced together separate parts of the speech in a way that wrongly suggested Mr Trump had urged his supporters to storm the US Capitol.

Asked on Fox News if he planned to follow through with his $1bn (£760m) lawsuit, Mr Trump said: “Well, I guess I have to, why not? Because they defrauded the public, and they've admitted it.”

The Panorama episode merged two sections of Mr Trump's speech to suggest the president encouraged his followers to march in Washington, DC, and “fight like hell”.

It omitted another passage in which he said he wanted supporters to protest peacefully.

“They [the BBC] actually changed my Jan 6 speech, which was a beautiful speech, which was a very calming speech, and they made it sound radical,” Mr Trump told Laura Ingraham on her show The Ingraham Angle.

He added: “And they actually changed it. What they did was rather incredible. They're showing me the results later on, the results of what they did, how they butchered it up, but it was very dishonest, and the head man quit, and a lot of the other people.”

Asked again if he would pursue legal action, he said: “Well I think I have an obligation to do it.”

Lawyers for Mr Trump sent a legal letter to the BBC on Sunday demanding compensation, an apology and a retraction of “false” and “inflammatory statements”.

The US president gave the BBC a deadline of Friday at 10pm GMT to comply, or face a legal claim for $1bn in the Florida courts.

Mr Trump added: “This is within one of our great allies, this [Britain] is supposedly a great ally. BBC, the Government has a chunk of that one, I guess.”

The scandal forced the resignations of Tim Davie, the director-general, and Deborah Turness, who stepped down as news chief on Sunday.

Mr Davie has since blamed “enemies” of the BBC for stoking the scandal engulfing the corporation, declaring the broadcaster “the very best of society”.

Addressing staff for the first time since his resignation on Monday, he said he was “fiercely proud” of the organisation and the work it does. “And that speaks louder than any newspaper, any weaponisation.”

“We are the very best of what I think we should be as a society, and that will never change,” he added. “We will thrive. And this narrative will not just be given by our enemies. It's our narrative. We own things.”

Lisa Nandy, the Culture Secretary, echoed Mr Davie's sentiment in the Commons, defending the BBC as “a light on the hill for people here and across the world”.

The White House is now considering blacklisting BBC reporters from White House events and limiting their access to the president.

Mr Trump has flexed his legal muscles to push organisations into line since his return to office.

Paramount, the parent company of CBS News, agreed a $16m (£12.2m) settlement with the US president in 2024 after he accused the broadcaster of deceptively editing an interview with Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent.

The president's remarks on Tuesday evening were the first since he took toTruth Social, his social media platform, to celebrate their resignations and praise The Telegraph's reporting on Sunday.

“The TOP people in the BBC, including TIM DAVIE, the BOSS, are all quitting/FIRED, because they were caught ‘doctoring' my very good (PERFECT!) speech of Jan 6,” Mr Trump wrote.

“Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists'.

“These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.

“On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!”

When President Donald Trump told reporters on Sept. 5 he'd started looking at sending the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, he said it was because of something he saw on television.

He said the city was being destroyed by paid agitators. “What they've done to that place, it's like living in hell,” he said, a comment that became an internet meme as some Portland residents juxtaposed it with tranquil images of the city.

Trump didn't say which channel he watched; he said at one point he saw something “today” and at another “last night.”

The evening before, on Sept. 4, Fox News aired a two-and-a-half-minute segment spotlighting protests outside a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Portland. Similar footage aired the morning of Trump's remarks. The president went on to announce Sept. 27 on Truth Social that he would send troops, saying that he was “authorizing Full Force, if necessary.”

He later said he'd told Oregon's governor, Tina Kotek, that “unless they're playing false tapes, this looked like World War II. Your place is burning down.”

ProPublica examined months of Fox News' coverage and reviewed more than 700 video clips posted to social media by protesters, counterprotesters and others in the three months preceding the Sept. 4 broadcast.

The review found that the news network repeatedly provided a misleading picture of what was happening in Portland.



As The Guardian and The Oregonian/OregonLive have reported, Fox News on Sept. 4 used footage from the 2020 protests after the police killing of George Floyd and said it was from 2025. We found two clear cases from that night as well as one that seemed to match a scene filmed at a key site of the 2020 protests. Fox also mislabeled two other dates of actions shown on screen, and one broadcast implied that a protest from elsewhere was happening in Portland.

Fox News chyrons about Portland the week of Trump's remarks carried phrases like “violent demonstrators,” “protesters riot,” “anti-I.C.E. Portland rioters” and “war-like protests.” One host said protesters were attacking federal officers.

This portrayal of protesters as routinely instigating violence or rioting was also misleading.

As ProPublica reported last week, most clashes between protesters and police before the Fox News segment did not result in any criminal charges or arrests alleging protesters committed violence. What's more, based on news releases from federal and local authorities, charges and arrests for assault, arson or destruction of property were almost entirely confined to a period that ended the night of July 4.

Videos after that date captured numerous images of federal officers forcefully moving in on protesters without corresponding criminal charges alleging protester violence.

A spokesperson for Fox News did not respond to ProPublica's requests for comment.

The Department of Homeland Security did not answer requests to comment on its officers' tactics.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said of action on the ground in Portland: “This isn't a peaceful protest that's under control, like many on the left have claimed, it's radical violence. President Trump is taking lawful action to protect federal law enforcement officers and address the out-of-control violence that local residents have complained about and Democrat leaders have failed to stop.”

Here's how Fox News' coverage of the Portland story was misleading.

Protests in 2020 in the wake of Floyd's murder by a police officer attracted large, sometimes violent crowds to Portland — along with a federal law enforcement response authorized by Trump.

The protests outside the ICE facility have typically been far smaller. Still, Fox spliced footage from 2020 into its coverage this year and claimed it was from 2025.

The Fox News correspondent in the segment that aired the night Trump was watching TV said: “On this night in late June, police used tear gas.”



The accompanying image appears to be not from the ICE building but from the federal courthouse in downtown Portland, more than a mile away. A nearly identical scene was shown in a Fox News video five years earlier. Footage that aired Sept. 4, shot at a slightly different angle, blurs out spots where graffiti was visible on the building in Fox's July 2020 broadcast.

Almost immediately after showing the courthouse scene, the segment cuts to another image as the correspondent says, “federal police used tear gas and flashbangs.”

On screen at that moment is a U.S. Navy veteran who was pepper-sprayed and repeatedly struck with a baton. But it didn't happen in September 2025. The video was posted on social media on July 18, 2020.



The Fox News segment about the ICE protests soon shows an American flag burning.

That image was posted on social media July 16, 2020.

The location: the base of a downtown Portland statue more than a mile away from the ICE building where protests are happening in 2025.

On the webpage for its Sept. 4 video segment, Fox News added an editor's note at least two weeks later: “This video contains footage from protests in Portland in 2020 and 2025.”

After mislabeling 2020 events as 2025, Fox's Sept. 4 evening broadcast explicitly drew a connection between the two periods.

“The protest chaos, which began with riots aimed at social justice in 2020, has severely damaged Portland's reputation,” the correspondent said.

The dramatic footage at this moment shows fires in the street and was broadcast on Fox on Aug. 19, 2020, the day after a crowd smashed through windows and set items on fire in the headquarters for the government of Multnomah County, where Portland is located.

We don't know for certain which broadcast got Trump thinking about Portland. The White House did not respond to questions about what Trump watched. But the president said on Sept. 5 that what he'd seen about Portland on TV was “unbelievable.”

“I didn't know that was still going on,” he said. “This has been going on for years.”

The reality: Portland's 2020 social justice protests, which resulted in hundreds of arrests and continued for months, turned sporadic by early 2021. Protests in years since have led to occasional property damage, but nothing in Portland has matched the scale of events that followed Floyd's death.

Portland police Chief Bob Day said at a Sept. 29 press conference that the city had been inaccurately portrayed through the lens of the protests in 2020 and 2021.

“What's actually happening, and the response we're seeing both from Portlanders and from the Portland Police Bureau,” Day said, “is not in line with that national narrative. And it is frustrating.”

In a Sept. 2 segment featuring the video from a day earlier, anchor Bill Hemmer said it shows “riots raging.” Anchor Trace Gallagher teased another Sept. 2 news segment by once again showing the video, saying, “It's a riot outside a Portland ICE facility.”



The Sept. 4 segment shows Julie Parrish, an attorney for a neighbor of the ICE facility, accusing Portland police of saying, “Meh, we're just gonna let violent rioters do this for 80 straight nights.”

The physical behavior of protesters that was captured on the video is not violent. The camera instead shows federal agents advancing on them. In the moments before officers tossed munitions into the crowd, videos show, one protester was blowing bubbles. The Portland police did not declare a riot, a legal designation that allows for an elevated police use of force. (They declared a riot just once, a police spokesperson said, on June 14.)

The Sept. 1 protest had “little to no energy,” according to an internal Portland police summary, before federal officers dispersed the crowd to collect a prop guillotine that had been brought. Katie Daviscourt, a Trump-aligned commentator who filmed the clips, noted on X that protesters were having dance parties and that their main problems were “not leaving restricted areas, burning a flag, and possessing a deadly object (guillotine).”

ProPublica found a similar pattern for the three months before Fox's Sept. 4 broadcast: clashes that on most days and nights had no criminal allegations of protester violence to explain them.

After dozens of arrests and charges were announced in June through July 4, federal prosecutors accused just three people of crimes at the ICE building in the roughly two months leading up to Fox's Sept. 4 broadcast.

During that same two-month time frame, ProPublica's review found numerous instances of police using force: videos from more than 20 days or nights with federal officers grabbing, shoving, pepper-spraying, tackling, firing on or using other munitions on protesters.

No local arrests or federal criminal charges were announced on these days or nights, and only a handful of dates corresponded with incidents of protester aggression later asserted by federal authorities in their legal case for sending troops.

Asked whether Fox News accurately represented her footage, Daviscourt said: “I stand by my four months of accurate reporting.”

Parrish told ProPublica she had collected evidence that “shows ongoing and persistent activity” outside the facility that under statute and police directive “would be considered riotous, unlawful assembly and/or disorderly conduct.” She declined to share this evidence, saying it was privileged as part of her client's file.

Her lawsuit on behalf of a neighbor living near the ICE facility, which sought to require police to enforce Portland's noise ordinance, was dismissed.

A Sept. 5 “Fox & Friends” segment showed a neighbor from an apartment building confronting protesters over noise, shouting at protesters: “Turn that (bleep) down, it's midnight! … We the people need sleep!”

Fox said it happened Tuesday, which would have been Sept. 2. Co-host Ainsley Earhardt said, “This has been going on for months now, but a lot of this since Labor Day,” as the video shown on screen sandwiches footage of the neighbor between other scenes from the Labor Day protest.

“This is a chaotic city,” co-host Brian Kilmeade said.

The next day, the clip of the neighbor appeared again on Fox News. This time, the network said the footage was from Wednesday, or Sept. 3.

In reality, the confrontation was captured on video months before. Daviscourt published the video on June 29 on X.

On the two September nights that Fox said the neighbor's confrontation happened, ProPublica's review found no videos of violent clashes posted on social media, and federal authorities announced no arrests.
For example, according to a Portland police email from 11:22 p.m. on Sept. 3: “There are still about 20 people hanging around but only 4 were even on the sidewalk in front of the building.”
Misrepresentations Continue After Trump's Guard Order
On Sept. 28, the day Trump's order was implemented, a Fox News broadcast played a clip of Kotek saying that Guard troops were not needed in Portland, then immediately cut to a clip of a hectic scene of protesters clashing with police.
“Wish she could see some of those images,” the anchor said. Sarcastically, as a co-anchor chuckled, she added: “Look at that. Just a peaceful protest.”
A small box on the screen showed the footage wasn't from Oregon.
It was from Illinois.

Last month, a former Chinese intelligence officer known as Eric publicly accused Chen Zhi, the Cambodian-Chinese tycoon behind the Prince Holding Group, of secretly collaborating with China's security apparatus.

Posting on X, Eric, currently based in Australia, alleged that Chen maintained close ties with senior officials in the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) Ministry of State Security and Ministry of Public Security, and that his sprawling business conglomerate had become a covert instrument for the regime's global operations.

“The Prince Group was not a target of China's anti-corruption campaign,” Eric said. “It was a deeply entangled partner.”

He said that he witnessed Chinese officials from Beijing and Chongqing holding secret meetings at Chen's private club in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh. “These officials met there to conspire to lure and arrest the exiled cartoonist Wang Liming,” he said, “and the entire meeting, from transportation to hospitality, was arranged by the Prince Group.”

Eric said he also saw Chen pleading with his former superior, asking China's Public Security Ministry to “make concessions” on his behalf.

“The company has become the financial reservoir and logistical base for China's intelligence system,” he said.

According to him, China's intelligence network operates under a principle known as “using business to support intelligence,” a military-derived doctrine that leverages commercial enterprises to fund and conceal espionage work.

Prosecutors said Chen led an international criminal enterprise operating under the guise of legitimate business. FBI Director Kash Patel described the operation as “one of the largest financial fraud takedowns in history,” after seizing $15 billion in bitcoin linked to the network.

Behind its commercial facade, the Prince Group maintained multiple compounds in Cambodia where trafficked workers were held captive and forced to conduct online investment scams, according to Eric. Victims' passports were confiscated, and they were threatened with violence.

Chen's rapid ascent in Cambodia was fueled by political patronage and connections to China. Born in China's Fujian Province, he later became a Cambodian citizen, receiving a prestigious civilian honor in the country, the Neak Oknha title, in 2020.

Soon afterward, he was appointed as an adviser to then Prime Minister Hun Sen, a position he has maintained under the current administration. Those positions provided both political cover and legitimacy for his alleged hidden activities, according to Eric.

Before the seizure, the FBI says Chen spent lavishly on yachts, private jets, luxury watches, and artwork, including a Picasso painting. One of his London office buildings, worth nearly £100 million, has been frozen by the British authorities.

Chen's co-conspirators, Prince Group's top executives, also allegedly used connections to Chinese law enforcement to bribe and influence local Cambodian police to extort businesses on behalf of Prince Group. In 2019, his associates purchased items worth over $3 million for a senior foreign official, the civil complaint stated.

“In an authoritarian system,” Zhang said, “those who hold power must be held responsible for what happens under their jurisdiction. The connection between Chen and the CCP's top leadership corresponds to specific levels within the power hierarchy, and those levels should bear responsibility for the crimes that occurred.”

Chen Zhi is now on the run. The federal government has frozen his assets in London and imposed sanctions on six individuals and six companies tied to him. If convicted on all charges, Chen could face up to 40 years in prison.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

 How His Second Term Is Reshaping America and the World

 Peter D. Feaver

Both supporters and critics of U.S. President Donald Trump agree that the first year of his second term has been an extraordinarily disruptive one. But for all its significance, this disruption wasn't entirely unexpected. Even as the final votes were being tallied, enough was known about Trump's intentions to make some relatively confident predictions about the shape of his second term, as I did one year ago for Foreign Affairs. Many of these predictions have already manifested. For example, Trump's most senior advisers are, as he promised they would be, people chosen based on personal loyalty and their capacity to mobilize his base. With some notable exceptions, such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, who may have fit into the old Trump cabinet, the personnel now driving Trump's second term policy apparatus are the “chaos agents” who were expected after the election.

Trump is also leaning even further into unilateralism, which was predictable given that he entered office this time around without many of the geopolitical constraints he had previously. In 2017, for instance, he inherited two coalitional wars with U.S. troop involvement (Afghanistan and the counter-ISIS campaign), and his hands were tied in regard to Iran by the coalitional diplomatic approach embodied in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Similarly, the constraints of the global trading system, which the first Trump administration had already sought to reduce, were reduced still further in the intervening years by efforts after the COVID-19 pandemic to create greater resiliency. Economically, Trump had a much freer hand to play in 2025, and as such he could pursue his maximalist approach to tariffs.

It was also possible to foresee much rockier civil-military relations this time around. Trump spent much of his first term surrounded by retired military brass, but during the last six months of that term, when their advice increasingly diverged from Trump's preferences and his base criticized him for giving in to their concerns, Trump concluded that the military was part of a “deep state” that was committed to hobbling him. Trump and his surrogates made clear that they intended to clean house on their return. Although his decision to summarily remove at least 15 senior officers—many of them women or people of color—without reference to specific instances of dereliction was alarming, it was not altogether surprising.

Still, despite the predictability of this opening act, several developments have progressed much further and faster than most had expected. Indeed, Trump has managed to truly shock observers on three fronts: his deployment of the military within U.S. borders; his pivot to the Western Hemisphere as the primary foreign policy theater, effectively pushing China to the back burner; and his ability to cow Congress into abdicating its powers and responsibilities. The significance, and perhaps permanence, of these first-year surprises suggests they could have an outsize influence on Trump's national security and foreign policy legacy. They also create the conditions for a wild swing of the pendulum, as future presidents attempt to overcorrect or, alternatively, pursue their own agendas to the new limits established by the Trump precedent.

Given how extensively Trump campaigned on the issue of immigration, it was no secret that on retaking office, he would turn inward with an exacting stance on undocumented immigrants. In his stump speeches, he floated the idea of involving the National Guard in deportation efforts—an outgrowth of how he used military units to patrol the southern border with Mexico during his first term. He also doubled down on his argument that local law enforcement was chronically overwhelmed, a conclusion he reached during the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.

But little from his first stint in office or from his campaign foretold the kinds of domestic military deployments that he has ordered in his second term. Trump has sent thousands of troops from the National Guard to major U.S. cities, such as Chicago, Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland, and Washington, D.C., in most cases over the objections of local authorities. In Los Angeles, Trump also authorized the use of active-duty marines, saying that local protests—which were sparked by aggressive raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement—had gotten out of hand. Trump and his advisers even talked repeatedly about invoking the Insurrection Act, which would empower the president to direct a large military response to function as an arm of law enforcement and address what he considered to be a domestic emergency.

Trump is by no means the first U.S. president to federalize the National Guard or deploy active-duty forces to handle problems within U.S. borders. But most domestic deployments are in response to natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005, or to help at major events, such as the Super Bowl or the inauguration. Likewise, using the military to patrol the border is not a shocking mission. Even critics of Trump's use of the military for border patrol during his first term didn't focus on the legitimacy of the deployment itself; instead, they questioned whether it was an efficient or appropriate use of military resources and training.



By contrast, Trump's domestic use of military forces over the past year has more clearly crossed a line by putting the apolitical military in the middle of partisan conflicts. Service members were sometimes sent to respond to peaceful protests of Trump's policies, other times to deal with a chronically high crime rate. In certain cases, they were sent for no evident reason beyond trolling or threatening predominantly Democratic cities. To be sure, prior presidents deployed the military domestically for contentious missions that they framed as defending the Constitution, most notably during the civil rights era, when local law enforcement could not be trusted to ensure the rights of the entire citizenry. Those deployments were politically controversial at the time, especially to those in the South who wanted to preserve the Jim Crow system of segregation. But history ultimately vindicated the decision, as Trump may believe it will do for him. The wide gap between the enormity of the military response and the triviality of the local threats in the present moment, however, raises the possibility that Trump's deployments will be judged not as a victory for constitutional defense, but rather as an attempt to advance a partisan policy agenda.

It is not surprising that the military has obeyed every order from Trump so far. The military plays only an advisory role in the American system, giving input to the president's deliberations but not otherwise independently adjudicating whether his or her decision is wise. Instead, the surprising part of the deployments is Trump's intention. Why Trump thinks they are necessary or smart remains uncertain. In the absence of clear and convincing explanations from the Trump administration as to the purpose of the deployments, many critics are offering worst-case extrapolations. They are surmising, for instance, that this is a dress rehearsal for aggressive deployments timed to shape, if not interfere with, the 2026 and 2028 elections. If accurate even only in part, such a dramatic escalation would cast doubt on the reliability of the election results and put the military at the center of the blame for the outcome. This would make it difficult for the military to remain the nonpartisan institution on which every administration depends. It would also turn the military into an unreliable protector of the Constitution.

It may have been obvious that the “America first” president intended to focus more of his attention on the Western Hemisphere, but it remains surprising the extent to which the second Trump administration has elevated the Western Hemisphere above the Indo-Pacific in its foreign policy approach. Based on the model of the first Trump administration, which effectively mobilized the entire federal government to take a more aggressive posture toward China, the Indo-Pacific seemed likely to be a priority in Trump's second term. The messaging from Trump's second campaign similarly promised an end to the distractions in Gaza and Ukraine in order to, as Vice President JD Vance stated, “focus on the real issue of China.” Addressing competition with China is also the one area for which there is broad bipartisan support.

But while the administration has certainly not ignored the Indo-Pacific, it has surprised many, and perhaps Beijing most of all, just how unexceptional China is in Trump's second-term view. Trump seems to be approaching China through the narrow lens of trade deals as opposed to a comprehensive, all-elements-of-national-power competitive strategy. China currently faces higher tariff rates than most other countries, but Trump has earnestly signaled his willingness to bring China's rates in line with those of other countries in exchange for a suspension of Beijing's restrictions on U.S. access to rare-earth minerals. After Trump met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea in October, he confirmed the potential to decrease, or even suspend, certain U.S. tariffs on China.

Adding to this surprise is Trump's unexpected treatment of the Western Hemisphere, where expansive foreign policy aims and considerations of the use of force have suddenly arisen. Trump's musings about expanding U.S. territory to include both Canada and Greenland and retaking control of the Panama Canal, for instance, which were originally dismissed as jokes, seem to be genuine foreign policy goals. Trump has returned to the threats more than once, including in direct statements on social media.



The president has also turned the “war on drugs” from a metaphor to a manifest. He has repeatedly threatened military force to strike drug gangs in Mexico without the cooperation of the Mexican government, which would amount to an act of war against the United States' southern neighbor—the first major military operation there since U.S. President Woodrow Wilson authorized the Punitive Expedition to capture the Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa on the sidelines of World War I. At the same time, Trump is dramatically ramping up aggressive military actions and coercive diplomacy against Nicolás Maduro's regime in Venezuela with repeated, lethal strikes on vessels he says are carrying drugs in the Caribbean and the Pacific.

Along the way, the Trump administration has given every indication that it is pursuing regime change in Venezuela, including Trump's recent confirmation that he has authorized covert CIA action there. Trump famously criticized regime change as a strategy in 2016, which helped make him a viable presidential candidate in the first place. The transformation of Trump from regime-change critic to champion is among the most astonishing developments thus far. Trump's pursuit of the violent collapse of a South American country is especially ironic considering it could directly increase the flow of migrants across the United States' southern border—an issue Trump campaigned aggressively on solving.

In every respect, Trump's pivot from China to the Western Hemisphere is a significantly unexpected dimension of his second term. If it's sustained, it will have global reverberations, possibly shifting the balance of power decisively in China's favor and further shrinking U.S. global influence.

To a certain extent, it is normal for second-term presidents to start with lofty, even overreaching ambitions. They enter office believing they have a clear mandate from the electorate, and they don't require the same learning curve as first-term presidents do. They are also eager to hit the ground running because, inevitably, they will confront the lame-duck stage of their presidency.

But while this political pattern could be predicted, Trump's impressive control over his base and his party is new. Even as his agenda oscillates wildly between opposing policies and backtracks on campaign promises—arming Ukraine versus not arming Ukraine, getting tough on China versus cutting a deal with China, ending forever wars versus striking adversaries in multiple theaters—Trump boasts stunning levels of popularity, with over 90 percent approval among Republicans. For the roughly 43 percent of respondents who self-identify as or lean Republican, what matters most is loyalty to Trump's agenda.

Even more surprising than Trump's continued control of his base, however, is the truly shocking dominance he has managed to assert over the legislative branch. Every modern president has dreamed of bypassing Congress and poaching congressional prerogatives, such as control of the purse strings, but no president since Franklin Roosevelt has been able to do so as effectively as Trump. This is especially impressive given the razor-thin majorities Republicans have in the current Congress. Only a few Republicans would have to defect to the Democrats' side to thwart some of Trump's more radical policies, but they have been remarkably reluctant to do so. The few who have flirted with defying the president have quickly seen their reelection fortunes falter. More remarkably still, the members who have announced their retirement and thus should be immune to reelection worries nevertheless remain reluctant to vote with Democrats to check the Trump administration in any meaningful way. In the wake of the dramatic Democratic sweep in the November 2025 elections, Republicans who are concerned about Trump's policies may be emboldened to flex their congressional oversight muscles. But thus far, the defining feature of Trump's second term has been the extent of Congress's deference to the executive, even as Trump usurps his colleagues' independent authority.



Trump, for instance, has ignored explicit congressional mandates in the area of foreign aid and undermined quasi-independent foreign policy institutions created by Congress. He has also sidelined the Government Accountability Office and the inspectors general. He has curtailed briefings to Congress by executive branch officials in the national security and foreign policy arenas. And he has bypassed congressional oversight on arms sales to the Middle East and security aid to Ukraine, even when those benefits were appropriated by Congress. But despite the litany of overt infringements on congressional authority, legislators have done little to retake their traditional role in policymaking.

If this trend continues, the American constitutional system could be decisively altered. The framers of the Constitution created a powerful president because they counted on powerful legislative and judicial branches to serve as counterbalances. If those branches willingly cede their responsibility to enforce guardrails on the executive, then the only check on presidential impulses will be whatever restraint the administration's internal deliberative process provides.

One year after Trump's reelection, the biggest unknown is how long any of this can last. Trump's actions, those foreseen and those unforeseen, are creating immense opportunities for change. Both domestic and international actors are sure to respond. Domestically, for instance, Trump has unsettled delicate equilibriums critical to both civil-military relations and constitutional checks and balances. In doing so, he has raised troubling questions about the future of the constitutional system. Yet the trends at home are not irreversible. If Congress rediscovers a zeal for protecting legislative prerogatives and exercising rigorous oversight of the executive branch, the rest of Trump's second term could diverge sharply from the first year. And if Democrats win one or both chambers of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections, the checks on the president would likely revert to historical norms—perhaps even returning to the congressional assertiveness of the immediate post-Watergate era.

If Republicans maintain control or even extend their majorities in Congress, the prospects are harder to predict. By that point, Trump would look increasingly like a lame duck, and ambitious Republicans might see some advantage in putting distance between themselves and the more controversial second-term Trump policies. On the other hand, such a history-defying electoral outcome could just as easily empower the administration to do whatever is necessary to cement Trump's legacy as the most transformative president of the modern era.

Internationally, the United States has long relied on the global power and influence that it built in the post–Cold War era to preserve great-power peace. But Trump is drawing down on these reserves, and at some point, the institutions that the United States relies on to constitute its power and manage the global order will crack. What comes next is anyone's guess. China, for instance, as the United States' principal rival for global power, has made it clear that it has no interest in shoring up the American-built order. Beijing seeks a replacement system that would more parochially benefit China, and at the moment, it might relish Trump's diversion to the Western Hemisphere so it can pursue its agenda in Asia, the region of greatest economic importance in the future.

Meanwhile, no foreseeable amalgamation of U.S. partners and allies appears capable of replacing American leadership on the global stage. While our European and Asian partners are keen to work with the United States to address geopolitical challenges, they are not capable of effecting lasting beneficial solutions without the United States shouldering its part of the burden. Without a change in trajectory, Trump's siphoning of American global power could usher in a new geopolitical order—one in which great powers that are hostile, or at best indifferent, to U.S. interests would hold sway in vast spheres of influence. Those spheres would increasingly rub up against one another, and the prospects for geopolitical fracture and great-power war would intensify.

Ultimately, Trump and his supporters are right when they boast about the extraordinary impact the second administration has had since taking office. It is as consequential a first year as any president since Roosevelt. Much of Trump's approach was predictable, including his general unpredictability. But the true surprises are those that are likely to reverberate for years to come. They are also the ones that make the long-term forecast harder to discern.

 China Gains From New Delhi's Support for South Asian Autocrats

 Muhib Rahman

In September 2025, tens of thousands of young protesters poured into the streets of Kathmandu and stormed Nepal's Parliament. They were furious about entrenched corruption and opposed recent attempts to clamp down on free speech and dissent through a social media blackout. Although the authorities killed numerous demonstrators, the uprising forced the resignation of Nepalese Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli and the installation of an interim government. Nepal, however, is only the latest example of a broader trend in South Asia. In 2024, a youth-led uprising ended the 15-year rule of Sheikh Hasina as prime minister of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka witnessed repeated waves of mass demonstrations, most dramatically in 2022, resulting in the ouster of a corrupt government. And in the Maldives, discontent over corruption, democratic backsliding, and polarizing foreign entanglements have led to similar protests demanding political change.

The uprisings across the region stem from domestic grievances, but that isn't the whole story. For years, India has embraced the notion that it is the world's largest democracy. It has championed liberal values and accepted the role—bestowed by the United States—of the Indo-Pacific's democratic linchpin. Yet when it comes to dealings in its own neighborhood, India has often behaved in decidedly illiberal ways, propping up autocratic regimes and meddling in the affairs of other sovereign countries. New Delhi has treated democratic ideals and human rights as expendable whenever its own strategic interests are at stake.

The United States, wary of alienating its key Indo-Pacific partner, rarely challenges India on how it manages its backyard. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter announced that the United States would defer to India in most matters to do with South Asia. Every U.S. administration since has echoed that policy of deference. New Delhi has propped up neighboring governments by bankrolling them, lobbying the West on their behalf, or deploying its security forces. In return, Washington has often stayed silent about any indiscretions it sees, retreating from the promotion of democracy when such an effort might clash with India's preferences.

As a result, smaller countries in South Asia view India as a regional hegemon, empowered to manipulate domestic politics with U.S. approval. This fuels resentment toward India and mistrust of the United States, catalysts for the kind of violent popular overthrow that has marked the subcontinent in recent years. Tellingly, the protesters in Nepal's September uprising angrily confronted Indian TV crews, associating them with the country's political crisis. This resentment not only threatens India but also creates fertile ground for the spread of Chinese influence. As South Asian publics have pushed back against governments closely aligned with New Delhi, Beijing has asserted itself, courting new regimes with loans and military hardware and stressing respect for their sovereignty.

South Asia's slide toward China has real consequences for Washington. As disillusioned governments draw closer to Beijing, the United States risks losing both influence and credibility in the region. This moment of flux calls for a reassessment of the U.S. relationship with New Delhi and the pursuit of a more balanced approach to South Asia—one that engages smaller neighbors as independent partners, not simply as appendages of India.

Nowhere has the contradiction between India's ostensible democratic principles and its support for autocrats been more glaring than in Bangladesh. For over a decade, India backed Hasina and her party, the Awami League, even as her rule grew more autocratic and as she retained power through controversial elections in 2014, 2018, and 2024. New Delhi's support enabled Hasina to undermine democratic institutions, politicize the judiciary and Election Commission, and enforce repressive laws such as the Digital Security Act, which limited free speech online and allowed arbitrary arrests and detentions of opponents of the regime.

Hasina's government helped India meet critical security objectives—notably, dismantling networks of anti-Indian insurgents that operated out of Bangladesh—and in return, India bolstered Bangladesh's authoritarian security apparatus. New Delhi provided diplomatic protection to the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), an elite Bangladeshi counterterrorism force that targeted opposition politicians, activists, and journalists. According to a 2023 report from Human Rights Watch, millions of Bangladeshis faced political persecution during Hasina's tenure, including arrests, prosecution, and violence. Indian officials frequently defended the actions of her government, insisting that it was a pillar of regional stability and a bulwark against terrorism. But New Delhi remained notably silent on the subject of domestic repression.

Public resentment toward India surged in response. In early 2024, the India Out movement flared, with widespread protests, boycotts of Indian-made goods, and powerful social media campaigns. The Bangladeshi government's brutal suppression of a student-led uprising in mid-2024, which according to the UN resulted in as many as 1,400 deaths, intensified public outrage. These demonstrations snowballed into mass protests that encouraged the country's military to abandon Hasina and toppled her government, forcing her to flee. Her exile in India exacerbated tensions with the interim government in Bangladesh, which has since held New Delhi at arm's length.



Before Hasina's ouster, the United States didn't do much to check the course of democratic backsliding in Bangladesh. It deferred, as it often has, to India's priorities. U.S. officials expressed concerns about irregularities in the 2014 and 2018 Bangladeshi elections but took little concrete action, yielding to India in its backing of Hasina. The Biden administration was the most assertive, imposing sanctions on the RAB in 2021 and, in 2023, implementing visa restrictions on Bangladeshi officials and political figures it deemed responsible for undermining elections. Still, the U.S. administration tempered its public criticism and held back broader penalties. Wary of straining ties with India, it acknowledged that Bangladesh's 2024 elections were “not free or fair” but avoided any stronger reproach.

Bangladeshi civil society welcomed rhetorical support for its democracy but was demoralized by Washington's reluctance to act decisively. After Hasina's government fell, China swiftly moved in. In October 2024, Chinese warships visited Chittagong—the first foreign naval vessels to do so after the establishment of the interim Bangladeshi government—signaling a major geopolitical shift. Significant diplomatic and military visits followed, as well as Chinese support for Bangladesh's involvement in naval exercises with Pakistan (a longtime Indian rival), Chinese defense technology transfers, and Chinese investment in infrastructure and economic zones. By mid-2025, the two countries had opened discussions on defense and free trade, and Bangladesh joined China and Pakistan for a trilateral summit in June after restoring diplomatic ties with the latter. This was a decisive turn away from Hasina's India-first posture and toward closer alignment with Beijing. The interim government turned to China and Pakistan to rebalance Bangladesh's options and secure tangible gains in defense cooperation and economic assistance. China's expanding role in Bangladesh is thus not merely opportunistic—it is the outcome of Washington's habitual deference to New Delhi. By failing to challenge India's support for an autocratic regime, the United States inadvertently opened the door for China.

A similar process unfolded in the Maldives, an archipelago country where domestic discontent over Indian influence led to a change in government and, subsequently, greater Chinese involvement. The outcome offered further evidence that prioritizing short-term stability over democratic values and accountable governance can invite long-term reversals, a trend that Washington and New Delhi would do well to reckon with.

After Abdulla Yameen became president of the Maldives in 2013, India treated him as an important ally, prioritizing military and surveillance cooperation with the government in Male even as Yameen became more authoritarian. By 2016, New Delhi had deepened its defense ties with Yameen's government, hosting him with high honors and signing agreements that made India the Maldives' primary security partner. Meanwhile, Yameen dismantled democratic institutions, jailing opposition leaders (including former President Mohamed Nasheed), manipulating the judiciary, and declaring states of emergency in 2015 and 2018 that allowed him to concentrate his power and silence dissent. In 2016, as the Commonwealth moved to censure the Maldives, New Delhi provided diplomatic cover by making the case for engagement over sanctions and supporting the Maldives' preemptive withdrawal from the organization. For many Maldivians, this was tantamount to India tacitly approving of repression.

But in 2018, Yameen was voted out of power. The Maldives' own India Out campaign—paradoxically led by Yameen after his electoral defeat to the pro-Indian politician Ibrahim Mohamed Solih—gained traction, casting India as a neoimperial power. By 2022, nationalist rhetoric from Yameen and his Progressive Party coalition intensified into a demand for the expulsion of the Indian troops stationed in the country. The movement helped propel Mohamed Muizzu, an opposition candidate from the anti-Indian People's National Congress, to a surprise victory in the 2023 presidential election. Framing his win as a reclamation of sovereignty, Muizzu expelled Indian troops and canceled defense agreements with New Delhi, abruptly ending decades of security cooperation between the two countries. A visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Male in July 2025 (his first since Muizzu took office) eased tensions somewhat, with the two leaders launching trade talks and opening a $565 million credit line for the Maldives in a shift toward a renewed economic partnership. But trust between New Delhi and Male remains thin, with the partnership yet to return to its former strength.



Despite the Maldives sitting along key sea-lanes, the United States has long treated the country as a footnote in its Indo-Pacific strategy. Washington delegated diplomatic responsibility for the Maldives to India, issuing no sanctions in response to democratic backsliding and refraining from penalizing Yameen as he undermined democratic institutions. As the anti-India movement in the Maldives gained momentum, China exploited the United States' absence, rapidly expanding its regional footprint by easing the tremendous debt the island country owed China. In January 2024, Muizzu visited Beijing and signed agreements spanning infrastructure, trade, fisheries, and digital connectivity.

In response, the Biden administration's secretary of state, Antony Blinken, attempted diplomatic damage control, hosting Maldivian Foreign Minister Moosa Zameer in Washington in June 2024 and extending offers of U.S. security and naval cooperation. Still, the gesture paled in comparison with what China offered: military assistance in the form of grants, hardware, and training, as well as a free trade agreement that included major infrastructure projects. The perception of Western indifference had hardened among Maldivians, who saw the U.S. overtures as reactions to Chinese regional influence rather than genuine efforts to support autonomy, democracy, and human rights in their country. Without convincing support for political transparency, democratic institutions, and a free civil society, U.S. attempts to engage the Maldives appeared to be mere geopolitical scheming.

The arc of discontent evident in Bangladesh and the Maldives, where Indian meddling has produced Chinese gains, is also visible in Sri Lanka. India emerged as a critical ally for Sri Lanka in the wake of the latter's civil war, which ended in 2009 with the defeat of the insurgent Tamil Tigers. As in Bangladesh and the Maldives, however, this support came at the expense of human rights and accountability. At a special session of the UN Human Rights Council that year, India voted in favor of a resolution praising Sri Lanka's victory and seeking to block Western calls for an investigation into alleged war crimes.

New Delhi continued to deflect international pressure from Sri Lanka in the years that followed, shielding Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa from meaningful global scrutiny and allowing him to consolidate power while dismissing Tamil grievances as Western propaganda. Meetings between Modi and Rajapaksa in subsequent years focused on security and counterterrorism strategy, sidestepping human rights issues. New Delhi's calculated leniency sent a clear signal: if the Sri Lankan government stayed aligned with India on regional security, India would not press it on past atrocities or its persecution of minorities.

By 2022, however, Sri Lanka faced economic collapse. Mismanagement by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Mahinda Rajapaksa's brother who was elected in 2019, triggered mass protests. New Delhi, in response, provided nearly $4 billion in condition-free assistance through credit lines, currency swaps, and emergency aid. India became Sri Lanka's de facto lender of last resort without requiring the Sri Lankan government to address concerns about the human rights abuses, militarization, or corruption that fueled the country's political crisis. But the bailout merely delayed the inevitable. Protesters stormed the palace in July 2022, forcing Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee. Much of the Sri Lankan public saw India as complicit in preserving a failing regime, and protesters spray-painted “India Out” on the walls of the presidential palace. Rajapaksa's successor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, turned to China for support. Beijing responded with alacrity, granting a two-year moratorium on debt repayments and, with the approval of the Sri Lankan government, advancing a $4.5 billion oil refinery project in Hambantota, one of the largest foreign investments in Sri Lanka's history. Once operational, the refinery will anchor a Chinese logistics hub just 180 miles from India's coast.

As the chaos unfolded, the United States expressed concern about Sri Lanka's democratic backsliding but largely followed India's lead. While Washington supported UN efforts to investigate wartime human rights abuses and provided humanitarian aid to Sri Lanka during the economic crisis in 2022, it did not press for the establishment of governance benchmarks or anticorruption safeguards from the Sri Lankan government, either through Indian cooperation or otherwise. U.S. officials praised India's financial lending but stayed quiet about the lack of accountability. Many Sri Lankans, especially the young protesters, viewed both New Delhi and Washington as responsible for the persistence of a corrupt old regime.

Like its South Asian peers, Nepal has watched for decades as India prioritized its regional influence over promoting local democracy, a policy that has exacerbated political upheavals in a country that has seen 14 different governments in the last 17 years. Although much of the country's instability is rooted in its internal fractiousness and troubled transition from monarchy to republican democracy, many Nepalis believe India's meddling has deepened their endemic political crisis.

New Delhi, for instance, imposed a blockade from late 2015 to early 2016 to punish Kathmandu for a constitutional change that affected Indian communities on the Nepali side of the border. At the time, the blockades crippled transportation routes and hospital services and prompted international warnings about a humanitarian crisis in the country, which was reeling from a devastating earthquake. Tensions between India and Nepal worsened. In 2020, the emergence of the #BackOffIndia social media campaign reflected a growing impatience among young Nepalis with New Delhi's overbearing influence and supposed sympathies for the royalist camp within Nepali politics. In 2025, protesters were not just rejecting oligarchic rot, but also reaffirming their long-standing frustration over India's role in sustaining it.

Washington has long seen Nepal as merely part of India's backyard, and therefore limits its involvement to aid projects and disaster relief while avoiding deeper diplomatic initiatives that might irk New Delhi. The only serious U.S. engagement with the country is the $500 million Millennium Challenge Corporation compact, which has funded major electricity transmission lines and road upgrades. To many Nepalis, however, the compact looked like a plan hatched in New Delhi to cement both Indian and U.S. authority in South Asia. Opponents of the agreement rallied outside the Parliament building in February 2022 and burned both American and Indian flags in protest.

These strained relations, and Nepal's domestic instability, opened the door for China to expand its influence in the country. In 2017, Nepal joined the Belt and Road Initiative, China's vast infrastructure investment program. It has since hosted a number of slow-moving Chinese-backed projects: the Kathmandu-Kerung railway, oil and gas exploration in the Dailekh district, and the cross-border economic corridor known as the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network, which forms part of the BRI. Chinese trade with Nepal is growing quickly, and Beijing touts the no-strings loans it has extended to Kathmandu. Even before he was forced from office, Oli began to hew closer to China, breaking protocol in 2024 by visiting Beijing before New Delhi to revive dormant rail talks and security coordination. Thus far, the interim government has signaled that it will maintain this China-friendly orientation while cautiously advancing domestic calls for accountability and autonomy.

Across South Asia, the pattern is clear: India prioritizes its narrow strategic interests over upholding democratic and liberal values. Washington, wary of straining its ties with New Delhi, looks the other way. Local populations view the dynamic as emblematic of U.S.-sponsored Indian hegemony, and the grievances pave the way for greater Chinese investment and influence. These are not isolated outcomes, but structural ones. South Asian democracies are battlegrounds for great-power rivalry. The more India interferes with democratic processes or props up unpopular strongmen, the wider the opening becomes for China. And as long as Washington continues to adopt a regional policy that defers to—and unthinkingly endorses—Indian preferences, it risks ceding South Asia to Beijing.

The remedy is not for Washington to micromanage India's neighborhood policy but to forge a shared democratic baseline for cooperation. If the world's two largest democracies cannot reconcile their geopolitical strategies with the democratic values they claim to share, China will continue to make strategic gains amid the wreckage that Indian and U.S. policies produce.

This is a prime moment for Washington to reassess its approach to South Asia. The U.S.-Indian partnership has been shaken in Trump's second term, with Washington slapping high tariffs on New Delhi ostensibly because of the latter's purchases of oil from Moscow. As U.S. officials determine what kind of partnership they want with India, they should change the way they look at the broader region. It is not simply India's backyard, but a series of independent partners home to hundreds of millions of people. Listening to local voices, setting clear standards for transparency and human rights, and responding firmly to breaches of those standards—including by India—will be key to making deals in South Asia that can last. If Washington does not want to see Chinese influence expand irrevocably in the region, it must stop deferring to India. Instead, it should take seriously the democratic aspirations of all South Asian states and remember that their citizens will not countenance repression and bad governance—especially when it is sponsored by the world's largest democracy.

            Latest Market News 





            Hot Stocks 





            Creating revolutionary pharmaceutical drugs, testing new materials for cars and simulating how market scenarios can affect banks — these are just some of the tasks that could take months or years to develop, even with the most advanced computers.
    


            But what if that timeframe could be cut down to minutes or hours?
    


            That's the promise behind quantum computing, a field that's been studied for decades and has garnered increasing interest — and investments — from tech giants and startups alike.
    


            On Wednesday, IBM revealed its new experimental Loon processor and Nighthawk quantum computing chip, which can perform more complex computations than its predecessor. The past two years have seen quantum-related announcements from Google, Microsoft and other tech companies.
    


            Quantum computing could potentially lead to a $1.3 trillion increase in value across certain industries by 2035, according to McKinsey & Company, and for good reason. Experts believe quantum computing could lead to breakthroughs in fields like cryptography, finance, science and transportation, and IBM says the technology could solve some problems in minutes or hours that would typically take non-quantum standard computers thousands of years.
    


            But there's a long road ahead. Cracking quantum computing isn't a matter of upgrading existing computers. It's an entirely separate approach to computing that relies on the principles of quantum physics.
    


            “A fighter jet is not a faster Ferrari because it has wings,” said Sridhar Tayur, a professor with Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business. “Quantum computing is not just a faster classical computer, because it works on a different principle.”
    


            Computers store and process information using a language made up of zeros and ones, also known as “bits.” But quantum computing uses “quantum bits,” also known as “qubits.” Instead of being either zero or one, qubits can behave like zero or one simultaneously and exist in states between zero and one, allowing them to process information much more quickly.
    


            Picture it as a flipping coin, as CNN's Anna Stewart explained. Bits are the coin when it lands on heads or tails, while qubits are the coin as it's spinning between heads and tails, or if the coin could represent heads and tails at the same time.
    


            But don't expect quantum computers to replace your laptop or smartphone. Instead, these types of computers are ideal for solving big-picture problems involving chemistry and mathematics, making them potentially game-changing in areas such as health, environmental studies, finance, materials science and cryptography.
    


            BMW Group and Airbus, for example, are working with quantum computing startup Quantinuum to research how the technology could be used in the development of fuel cells. Meanwhile, Accenture Labs, biotechnology firm Biogen and quantum computing company 1QBit are collaborating on research related to drug discovery. Quantum computers can compare molecules that are much larger than the ones classical computers can compute, Accenture said on its website.
    


            “The big hope is that a quantum computer can simulate any sort of chemical or biological experiment you would do in the lab,” said Anand Natarajan, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at MIT.

            Quantum computing could be hugely influential when it comes to cryptography and cybersecurity since it can be used to break codes used to protect data, said Natarajan.
    


            “So that's also a major motivation, to make sure that our adversaries cannot do it and that we have this capability,” he said.
    


            The Wall Street Journal reported in October that a handful of quantum computing companies were discussing potential deals with the Commerce Department that would provide federal funding in exchange for an equity stake.
    


            When asked for comment, a Commerce Department spokesperson told CNN that it “is not currently negotiating equity stakes with quantum computing companies.”
    


            But the industry has a wave of challenges to overcome before quantum computing can solve modern dilemmas. For example, qubits are extremely fragile, making them very susceptible to external factors like changes in temperature or light.
    


            IBM's new experimental Loon processor attempts to address this hurdle by demonstrating that the components exist to build a fault-tolerant quantum computer at scale that can function effectively even when errors are present. It's an important step because errors are inevitable given qubits are so susceptible to interference.
    


            “If I just vibrate a table, I'll kill our quantum computers. If a little bit of light gets in there, it can hurt it,” said Jay Gambetta, director of research at IBM.
    


            IBM's new Nighthawk chip, meanwhile, can run more complicated “gates,” according to Gambetta. Gates are the “building blocks” quantum computers use to process information, as the National Institute of Standards and Technology describes it.
    


            IBM is just one contender in the quantum computing race. Microsoft in February introduced its Majorana 1 quantum computing chip. That chip contains a special material the company says can create a new state of matter capable of producing more stable qubits. Google in December unveiled its Willow quantum computing chip that it says reduces errors as more qubits are used and can do in five minutes what would take a classical computer 10 septillion years.
    


            The jury is still out on exactly when quantum computing will live up to its potential.
    


            Natarajan believes we're still likely a decade or two away. McKinsey said 72% of the tech executives, investors and academics it spoke with say a fully fault-tolerant quantum computer could arrive by 2035. IBM expects to reach fault-tolerant quantum computing by the end of the decade.
    


            But when it does happen, the benefits could be tremendous.
    


            “Right now, in some sense … we are trying to do brain surgery using a spoon and a fork. But ideally, to do brain surgery, you would need far more refined tools,” said Tayur of Carnegie Mellon. “And that far more refined tools (are) one of the promises of the quantum computer.”

            Former Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia announced her campaign to return to Congress on Wednesday, aiming to recapture a key battleground district with more favorable midterm tailwinds next year.
    


            “I cannot sit back and watch as Republicans in Congress create chaos while failing to address the rising cost of living and the issues that matter to Coastal Virginians,” Luria said in a statement announcing her bid. “Virginians are hungry for change, and I look forward to getting back to work for Hampton Roads.”
    


            A Navy veteran, Luria was among several Democrats with national security backgrounds elected during the 2018 midterms of President Donald Trump's first term. She lost her seat four years later to GOP Rep. Jen Kiggans as Republicans won control of the US House during Democrat Joe Biden's term.
    


            Virginia Democrats are ascendant after sweeping the top three statewide offices in this month's off-year elections and making gains in the House of Delegates. National Democrats are optimistic that Trump's overall unpopularity could help them regain the House, particularly by flipping districts in blue-leaning states like Virginia.
    


            Luria could also benefit from a potential mid-decade redistricting under consideration by Virginia state lawmakers that could make it harder for Kiggans to win reelection.
    


            During her time in Congress, Luria established a moderate reputation, aligning with national security-focused moderates like Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger, who were elected the new governors of New Jersey and Virginia last week, respectively.
    


            She also served on the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot, accusing Trump of a “dereliction of duty.”
    


            Virginia's 2nd District currently covers a large southeastern portion of the state surrounding Norfolk, shaped by its significant exposure to a large US Navy base there.

            Entering the winemaking business is not for the faint of heart. Doing so with no prior experience, on the edge of a desert where temperatures hit 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit), might be considered foolhardy. But for Rudie van Vuuren, the gamble paid off.
    


            Van Vuuren is the managing director of Neuras Wine and Wildlife Estate, 140 miles south of Windhoek, Namibia. Situated in the foothills of the Naukluft Mountains, on the fringe of the Namib Desert, the boutique operation is, according to its owners, the driest vineyard outside of the Atacama Desert in Chile. Wrangling a hostile climate as well as hungry baboons, Neuras has plotted a journey from amateur enthusiasm to award-winning winemaking, putting this remote corner of Africa on the grape-growing map.
    


            In recent years the tiny vineyard has won international medals, including golds and double golds, for its red wine, ruby dessert wine and “nappa” (a spirit similar to grappa).
    


            The winery manager says that none of this would have happened without the unlikely help of a leopard called Lightning.
    


            Van Vuuren had lived multiple lives before pursuing winemaking. A medical doctor who was also a member of the Namibian national cricket and rugby teams —and who played at World Cups in both sports — he became a conservationist.



            In 2009, Van Vuuren was in a helicopter, tracking a leopard, Lightning, which had been rescued then released into the wild. Suddenly below him appeared a desert oasis. The land, he learned, belonged to a retired Shell executive who had nurtured vines on a small area of his 14,500-hectare tract. Van Vuuren descended to inform him there was a big cat on his property and fell in love with the vineyard — and its wine.
    


            “I went back and told Marlice (﻿van Vuuren, Rudie's wife) about the place and she just said, ‘Is there water? What's the camp look like? What do the roads look like?'” he recalled. “I said, ‘I didn't look at any of that, I just looked at the wine — and we're going to buy Neuras.'”
    


            In 2011, the vineyard and surrounding land became part of the couple's conservation program, the Naankuse Foundation.
    


            “It was perfect,” said Van Vuuren. The site could be used as a release point for animals into the neighboring Namib Naukluft National Park, “and on top of that, you had the economic engine of winemaking” — the proceeds of which could fund their conservation work.
    


            Without any professional knowledge of winemaking, the Van Vuurens' engine was never likely to hit top gear. It took the couple over a decade to hire the right person to elevate their part-time venture into a serious business. That person was South African winemaker Braam Gericke.
    


            Gericke talks about winemaking in mystical terms (“it's not work, it's a form of art;” “you don't change vineyards based on what you want; vineyards change you”) but his deft touch has paid dividends. “He was the one who cracked the code,” said Van Vuuren.
    


            Grapes are grown under netting to keep off hungry baboons and kudus (large antelopes) that roam the area. Each January, half a dozen employees harvest grapes by hand between 6 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. precisely, says Gericke, before the heat of the day sets in. After barrel fermentation for 12-18 months, a “really old school” manual bottling line is set up, where no more than 200 bottles of a given wine are produced in a season.
    


            “I like to think of it as Old World winemaking meeting New World winemaking,” he added.
    


            The location's secret sauce is how the vines are watered. In a region that can receive as little as 5mm (less than half an inch) of annual rainfall, Neuras has the good fortune of sitting on a basin with five underground freshwater springs.
    


            “It's the purest form of water that you can get,” said Gericke. He says the water has been carbon dated and takes 1,800 years to reach the point where it is collected and used in a drip irrigation system.
    


            “We considered expanding the vineyard when we started being successful, and then sanity prevailed,” said Van Vuuren. In fact, he explained, a water study of the property found that the vineyard couldn't expand with the available resources.
    


            “We now respect what nature has decided for us. We're going to keep the vineyard small (and) we are going to make sure the quality is where it is now, and gets even better,” he added.
    


            The skill of Gericke and his team, as well as time and weather, will play a large part in the vineyard's future success.
    


            Climate change is making winemaking an increasingly volatile business. Many wine growing regions around the world could be unsuitable for grape growing should the planet breach 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of human-induced climate change, according to a 2024 report. The race is on for winemakers: vineyards are ripping up vines to replace them with more resilient varieties, and some European producers are looking north to land with similar growing conditions to futureproof their businesses (see: champagne houses buying up parts of Kent in the UK).
    


            Does Neuras offer a blueprint for success?
    


            “We grow and make wine in extreme conditions. Intense heat, little rain … (and) climate change (is) only amplifying that,” said Van Vuuren. “So instead of resisting, we try and learn to adapt.”
    


            “Our water management approach takes every element into consideration: cultivar, temperature, soil composition, depth of the vine's roots. It's a science on its own,” he added. “You have to listen to the vine. It tells you what it needs and when.”
    


            That said, Neuras has one eye on necessary changes. The vineyard is exploring growing Pinotage, a red grape, known for its resilience and lower water requirements, said Van Vuuren, on an unconventional trellis system better suited to dry conditions.
    


            “While water limits physical expansion, it inspires smarter viticulture,” he added.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Approval of the way President Donald Trump is managing the government has dropped sharply since early in his second term, according to a new AP-NORC poll, with much of the rising discontent coming from fellow Republicans.

The survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research was conducted after Democrats' recent victories in off-year elections but before Congress took major steps to try to end the longest shutdown in U.S. history. It shows that only 33% of U.S. adults approve of the way the Republican president is managing the government, down from 43% in an AP-NORC poll from March.

That was driven in large part by a decline in approval among Republicans and independents. According to the survey, only about two-thirds of Republicans, 68%, said they approve of Trump's government management, down from 81% in March. Independents' approval dropped from 38% to 25%.




The results highlight the risks posed by the shutdown, which Trump and his administration have tried to pin squarely on Democrats, even as U.S. adults have cast blame on both parties as the funding lapse has snarled air traffic, left hundreds of thousands of federal workers without paychecks and comprised food aid for some of the most vulnerable Americans. But it could also indicate broader discontent with Trump's other dramatic — and polarizing — changes to the federal government in recent months, including gutting agencies and directing waves of mass layoffs.




Republicans have generally been steadfast in their support for the president, making their growing displeasure particularly notable.

“I'm thoroughly disturbed by the government shutdown for 40-something days,” said Beverly Lucas, 78, a Republican and retired educator who lives in Ormond Beach, Florida, and compared Trump's second term to “having a petulant child in the White House, with unmitigated power.”

“When people are hungry, he had a party,” she said, referring to a Great Gatsby-themed Halloween party held at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. “I thought he seems callous.”

The survey found an overwhelming majority of Democrats, 95%, continue to disapprove of Trump's management of the federal government, compared with 89% in March.

Even with the decline in support for his management of the government, Trump's overall approval rating has remained steady in the new poll. About one-third of U.S. adults, 36%, approve of his overall handling of the presidency, roughly in line with 37% in an October AP-NORC poll. Approval of his handling of key issues like immigration and the economy have also barely changed since last month.




Health care emerged as a key issue in the shutdown debate as Democrats demanded that Republicans negotiate with them to extend tax credits that expire Jan. 1. But Trump's approval on the issue, which was already fairly low, has barely changed.

About one-third, 34%, of Americans said they approved of Trump's handling of health care in the November poll, compared with 31% in October. 

And many of his supporters are still behind him. Susan McDuffie, 74, a Republican who lives in Carson City, Nevada, and retired several years ago, said she has “great confidence in Trump” and thinks the country is on the right track. She blames Democrats for the shutdown and the suffering it's caused.

“I just don't understand how the Democrats can care so little about the people,” she said, scoffing at the idea that Democrats were trying to use the shutdown to force Republicans to address soon-to-skyrocket health care costs.

“I don't have any patience for the Democrats and their lame excuses,” she said, arguing that people who are scared about SNAP benefits expiring and struggling to put food on the table are a more pressing issue. 

When it comes to the shutdown, there is still plenty of blame to go around. Recent polls have indicated that while Republicans may be taking slightly more heat, many think Democrats are at fault, too.

“I truly do believe it's everybody. Everybody is being stubborn,” said Nora Bailey, 33, a moderate who lives in the Batesville area in Arkansas and does not align with either party.

After recently giving birth, she said, she faced delays in getting a breast pump through a government program that helps new mothers while her son was in intensive care. And she is worried about her disabled parents, who rely on SNAP food stamp benefits.

Overall, she said she is mixed on Trump's handling of the job and disapproves of his management of the federal government because she believes he has not gone far enough to tackle waste.

“I don't see enough being done yet to tell me we have downsized the federal government instead of having all these excess people,” she said.

It's possible that Trump's approval on handling the federal government will rebound if the government reopens. But the showdown could have a more lasting impact on perceptions of the president, whose approval on the economy and immigration has eroded slightly since the spring.

Lucas, the Florida Republican, said shutdowns in which civilians aren't paid are the wrong way to address ideological disagreement.

“Air traffic controllers? Really? You want to not pay the people in whose hands your lives are every day?” she said. “We need to be addressing these conflicts like intelligent people and not thugs and bullies on the playground.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The sex-offending financier Jeffrey Epstein wrote in a 2019 email to a journalist that Donald Trump “knew about the girls,” according to communications released Wednesday, but the White House quickly accused Democrats of selectively leaking the emails to smear the president.

The emails made public by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee also include one that Epstein wrote in 2011 in which he said Trump had “spent hours” at Epstein's house with a victim of sex trafficking.

The disclosures seemed designed to raise new questions about Trump's friendship with Epstein and about any knowledge he may have had in what prosecutors call a yearslong effort by Epstein to exploit underage girls. The Republican president has consistently denied any knowledge of Epstein's alleged crimes and has said he ended their relationship years ago.

The version of the 2011 email released by the Democrats redacted the name of the victim, but Republicans on the committee later said it was Virginia Giuffre, who accused Epstein of arranging for her to have sexual encounters with a number of his rich and powerful friends.

That's notable because Giuffre, before she died earlier this year, had long insisted that Trump was not among the men who had victimized her.

In a court deposition, she said under oath that she didn't believe Trump had any knowledge of Epstein's misconduct with underage girls. And in her recently released memoir, she described meeting Trump only once, when she worked as a spa attendant at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.




Giuffre described being introduced to Trump by her father, who also worked at the club. She described Trump as friendly and said he offered to help her get babysitting jobs with parents at the club. Other members of Epstein's household staff also said in sworn depositions that, while Trump did stop by Epstein's house, they didn't see him engage in any inappropriate conduct.

White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt accused the Democrats of having “selectively leaked emails” to “create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.”

The messages are part of a batch of 23,000 documents provided by Epstein's estate to the Oversight Committee. The release resurfaces a storyline that had shadowed Trump's presidency during the summer when the FBI and the Justice Department abruptly announced that they would not be releasing additional documents that investigators had spent weeks examining, disappointing conspiracy theorists and online sleuths who had expected to see new revelations.




In one 2019 email to journalist Michael Wolff, who has written extensively about Trump, Epstein wrote of Trump, “Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”

In an April 2, 2011, email to Ghislaine Maxwell, an Epstein girlfriend now imprisoned for conspiring to engage in sex trafficking, Epstein wrote, “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump. (Redacted name) spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.”

Maxwell replied the same day: “I have been thinking about that.”

The name of the person said to have spent time with Trump was blacked out of the email, but House Democrats identified the person as a “victim.”

Leavitt said that the unnamed person referenced in the emails is Giuffre, who had accused Britain's then-Prince Andrew and other influential men of sexually exploiting her as a teenager and who died by suicide in April. Andrew, who recently was stripped of his titles and evicted from his royal residence by King Charles III after weeks of pressure to act over his relationship with Epstein, has rejected Giuffre's allegations and said he didn't recall meeting her.

Leavitt said in a statement that Giuffre had “repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and ‘couldn't have been friendlier' to her in their limited interactions.”

“The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,” the statement said. “These stories are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to distract from President Trump's historic accomplishments, and any American with common sense sees right through this hoax and clear distraction from the government opening back up again.”

Giuffre came forward publicly after an initial investigation ended in an 18-month Florida jail term for Epstein, who made a secret deal to avoid federal prosecution by pleading guilty instead to relatively minor state-level charges of soliciting prostitution. He was released in 2009.

In subsequent lawsuits, Giuffre said she was a teenage spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago when she was approached in 2000 by Maxwell.

Lawyers for Maxwell, a British socialite, have argued that she never should have been tried or convicted for her role in luring teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. She is serving a 20-year prison term, though she was moved from a low-security federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas after she was interviewed in July by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.

Epstein took his own life in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal charges.

CHICAGO (AP) — The cyclists arrive at sunrise, rolling through Chicago's Latino neighborhoods and stopping at tamale carts, elote stands and candy stalls. They buy out every last item — every tamale, every corn cob, every bundle of sweets. Then they load up the food and deliver it to shelters and families in need.

Since the start of a federal immigration crackdown that has led to more than 3,200 arrests in the Chicago metropolitan area, streets and storefronts in the city's Latino neighborhoods have emptied out. Street vendors, fearing arrest, have been afraid to leave their homes to work. Local restaurants have struggled as customers stay home.

But as fear spread, so did something else — neighbors stepping up for one another and finding creative ways to show up for vendors and restaurant owners. This includes a grassroots effort to organize so-called “buy out” events meant to allow vendors who fear being detained by immigration agents to go home early. Some Chicagoans have pooled money in their neighborhoods or through local organizations while others have simply bought out taco stands while on their way to work or tamale vendors outside their local bars.

In Little Village, Rick Rosales, community organizer with Cycling x Solidarity, helps organize two of these “buy out” rides per week that typically support five street vendors each.

“The vendors are often speechless,” Rosales said. “They'll say, ‘I have a lot of tamales. You want all of them?'”

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Once, after the group bought out a tamale vendor's cart, that man found them days later to say immigration agents were spotted on his block just hours after. “You saved my life,” Rosales said the man told them.

“This is about food and joy and bike rides,” Rosales said. “But it's also so incredibly high stakes because of the fear in our communities right now.”

It's hard to say how many street vendors have been targeted by federal immigration agents, said Maria Orozco, outreach organizer for the Street Vendors Association of Chicago, adding she knows of at least 10 who have been detained.

In September, a tamale vendor was detained while selling outside a Home Depot, according to local advocates. Soon after, federal agents arrested a flower seller in the southwest neighborhood of Archer Heights. Then they came for a cotton candy vendor in the predominantly Mexican American Little Village. Immigration agents descended on the Swap-O-Rama flea market in October and detained more than a dozen people. And last week, over 100 residents in the Brighton Park neighborhood rallied to demand the release of their local tamalero.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Orozco said losing these vendors is as much a cultural loss as an economic one, calling them part of the “fabric of our city.” She said they bring life, color and flavor to the city's streets, preserving culinary traditions and building a sense of community — and they are beloved by neighbors.

Street vendors who are afraid to work or are seeing drops in sales can apply to get financial support through the Street Vendors Association of Chicago. The group launched a GoFundMe with the goal of raising $300,000 to support street vendors.

Orozco said local businesses have also hosted pop-up events where a certain percentage of proceeds go to street vendors. The organization has also helped connect vendors to people hoping to “buy them out,” Orozco said.

“It's been emotional to see,” she said. “The vendors themselves didn't realize how much Chicagoans love and support them. None of us expected this.”

As Alonso Zaragoza, executive administrator of his neighborhood advocacy group, drove through his predominantly Latino community of Belmont Cragin, he noticed restaurants were mostly empty and dark. Restaurants in majority-Latino communities have reported significant drops in sales since federal agents descended on the city in September.

So Zaragoza began organizing restaurant crawls, drawing hundreds to struggling Latino-owned eateries. His previous event began at a taco and tamales restaurant and ended with a Mexican ice cream shop. Along the way, street cart vendors hawked elote, cotton candy and balloons as a local musical group played folk and bluegrass music.

“The financial support for our businesses is needed more than ever now,” Zaragoza said. “It goes such a long way.”

Delilah Martinez, a community organizer and owner of the Vault Gallerie in Pilsen, couldn't stand the silence on her street anymore. She was used to seeing familiar faces on 18th Street — a woman selling candy with her baby strapped to her back, a paletero who smiled at her each afternoon. Then one week, they were gone.

“It broke my heart,” Martinez said. “The streets felt empty. Our people were putting their freedom at risk just to work.”

She began raising money online and started “Operation Buyout,” approaching vendors one by one to purchase everything they had. The first woman was shocked when Martinez handed her $500.

“I just wanted her to have a day of rest, a day without fear,” Martinez said.

Among those Martinez helped recently was a baker from Mexico City who arrived in Chicago 24 years ago.

Each night, he works late, hands dusted with flour, kneading dough until they're sore and aching. For those few quiet hours, after his four children are asleep, the world feels simpler.

“There is a magic when I'm baking,” he said in Spanish. “I feel free. When I'm angry, I feel like the bread will absorb it. So I try to be happy and at peace, even when I know the reality is different.”

By 3 a.m., he's up again for his grocery store shift, juggling work and school drop-offs. For years, he's sold birthday cakes and pan dulce “by word of mouth” from his small kitchen, dreaming of one day opening his own shop.

But the baker has also heard the stories: street vendors arrested on residential streets and federal agents circling his historically Mexican American neighborhood of Pilsen. Two of his friends have been detained. When he hears sirens and helicopters, he feels “sick with fear.”

“I'm afraid for my youngest daughter,” he said. “It would be horrible to leave her. … I can't see myself without my children.”

Martinez led the baker to a table and pulled off a black cloth. A silver, restaurant-grade mixer gleamed under the fluorescent light. Martinez also handed him an envelope with $1,500 gathered from neighbors hoping to help support him when he feels unsafe selling his baked goods on the street.

The man's hand flew up to cover his mouth. He kicked his legs and began to cry.

“Thank you so much,” he said, clutching a mixer attachment to his chest. “It's beautiful.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Visa and Mastercard have proposed a settlement in their long-running legal dispute with merchants and retailers over how much they charge merchants to accept their cards.

The most important part of the settlement could directly impact how customers use their Visa- and Mastercard-issued credit cards, and may result in some consumers getting denied at the point-of-sale for purchases

Visa and Mastercard have been in litigation with a class-action group of merchants for nearly 20 years over the costs they impose on merchants to use their payment networks, known as interchange. A previous settlement was rejected by the judge overseeing the case last this year, requiring Visa and Mastercard's lawyers to go back to the drawing board on the scope and size of the settlement.

The new part of the settlement announced Monday addresses the “honor all cards” rule, a cornerstone of how credit and debit cards work in the U.S.

The “honor all cards” rule states that if a merchant accepts Visa or Mastercard as a form of payment, they are required to accept all iterations of Visa and Mastercard products, regardless of who issues it and the cost to the merchant.

That has led to consternation among merchants over the years because rewards-heavy credit cards, like the Chase Sapphire Reserve or Citi Strata Elite, use a premium version of a Visa or Mastercard. For the Sapphire Reserve, Chase uses the Visa Infinite card, and for a card like Strata Elite, it's issued as a World Elite Mastercard. These cards have gotten far more popular in the last decade.




Both a Visa Infinite and World Elite Mastercard cost more for a merchant to accept. The amount of additional interchange a merchant will pay varies on size and industry, but one example is the Visa Infinite, which can be 15 basis points (0.15%) more expensive than a Visa Signature (a mid-tier credit card) for a merchant to accept.

Under the proposed settlement, merchants could discriminate between the different tiers of Visa and Mastercard products, meaning high-reward credit card users may be declined at checkout if the merchant has opted out of accepting the higher-tier card. A merchant may also be able to pass along the higher cost to accept the rewards cards to the customer in the form of a surcharge on their bill, under the proposed settlement.

This will place merchants in the position of making a choice: accept all cards with the higher fees or reject some of the higher-fee cards and likely upset wealthier consumers who typically enjoy earning points on routine purchases.

Like the previous settlement last year, merchants would receive a temporary reduction on swipe fees for a few years. In this settlement it would be a 10 basis point reduction in swipe fees for five years, and standard credit card transactions would be processed at 1.25% of the purchase price for eight years.

When the settlement was announced on Monday, the major merchant and retail lobby groups came out in opposition, so it's not certain whether this settlement will ultimately be the one that is finalized. Merchants and lobbyists have been pushing for years to get Congress to regulate interchange fees, as they do with debit cards. The merchant groups say this settlement does not go far enough. 

“Once again, this proposal is all window dressing and no substance. The reduction in swipe fees doesn't begin to go far enough, and the change in the honor-all-cards rule would accomplish nothing. If the courts can't fix this, it's time for Congress to take action,” said Stephanie Martz, chief administrative officer and general counsel for the National Retail Federation, in a statement.

The payment networks, who are ready to put the matter behind them after two decades of litigation, say this may be the best solution for the merchants to potentially avoid a drawn out trial-and-appeal process.

“We believe that this is the best resolution for all parties, delivering the clarity, flexibility and consumer protections that were sought in this effort,” a Mastercard company spokesperson said.

The settlement involves Visa and Mastercard only. American Express, which uses a closed-loop system where it's both the issuing bank and payment network for their cards, is not involved in this ongoing litigation. The settlement also does not impact debit cards.

WASHINGTON (AP) — As the House returns Wednesday for the first time in months, Democrat Adelita Grijalva will be sworn in as its newest member, more than seven weeks after winning a special election in Arizona to fill the seat last held by her late father.

Grijalva's swearing-in is expected to be among the first actions by House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who had previously declined to seat her until the chamber reconvened following a deal to end the government shutdown. The official ceremony is set for 4 p.m. EST, shortly before the House is expected to begin voting. 

For Grijalva, it's the end of a weekslong delay that she and other Democrats said was intended to prevent her signature on a petition to eventually trigger a vote to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein. In an interview with The Associated Press, she said the thought of finally being sworn in was “emotional” and “very much a roller coaster.”

“We've been waiting for this so long that it's still surreal,” she added.

Grijalva's arrival kicks off a busy day on Capitol Hill as hundreds of House members return, their trips potentially complicated by travel delays caused by the shutdown. 

Lawmakers who win special elections typically take the oath of office on days when legislative business is conducted. But with the House out of session since Sept. 19, Johnson had said he would swear her in when everyone returned. He did swear in two Republican members this year when the chamber was not in legislative session. 




“I don't think he's thought of anything that he's doing, in this case, as anything personal,” Grijalva said. “It feels personal because, literally, my name was attached. I also know that if I were a Republican, I would have been sworn in seven weeks ago.”

She will start her House tenure by voting on the Senate-passed legislation to reopen the government. Grijalva and most Democrats are expected to oppose it because it does not extend Affordable Care Act tax credits that expire at the end of the year. Republicans can still pass the bill with their slim majority.

Grijalva would be the final necessary signature on a discharge petition linked to legislation that would require the Justice Department to release all unclassified documents and communications related to Epstein and his sex trafficking operation.

The Epstein Files Transparency Act, co-sponsored by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., is supported by all Democrats and three Republicans, Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Nancy Mace of South Carolina.

Grijalva can add her signature to the petition once she is sworn into office. But her move will not mean a vote right away, due to House rules.

Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern, the top Democrat on the House Rules Committee, said he expects voting on the Epstein bill to take place in early December.

Emails released Wednesday from Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee are likely to reignite interest in the issue. Epstein write in a 2011 email that Donald Trump had “spent hours” at Epstein's house with a victim of sex trafficking and said in a separate message years later that Trump “knew about the girls.”

“The Democrats selectively leaked emails to the liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. 

Leavitt and Republicans on the committee said the person in question was Virginia Giuffre, who accused Epstein of arranging for her to have sexual encounters with a number of his rich and powerful friends. Giuffre, before she died this year, had long insisted that Trump was not among the men who had victimized her.

Rep. Raúl Grijalva, Adelita's father, died in March after more than two decades in the House, where he built a reputation as a staunch progressive.

Adelita Grijalva has long been active in local politics. She served on the Tucson Unified School District board before joining the Pima County Board of Supervisors, where she became only the second woman to lead the board.

She won the Sept. 23 special election with ease to complete the remainder of her father's term, representing a mostly Hispanic district in which Democrats enjoy a nearly 2-to-1 voter registration advantage over Republicans. Grijalva said the win was emotional. 

“I would rather have my dad than have an office,” she said.

She told the AP that environmental justice, tribal sovereignty and public education are among her priorities, echoing the work her father championed.

“I know that the bar is set very high, and the expectation is high of what we're going to be able to do once sworn in,” she said.

This story has been corrected to reflect that Adelita Grijalva was elected more than seven weeks ago, not nearly seven weeks ago.

NEW YORK (AP) — In the decade following her debut album, Meghan Trainor has lived myriad lives — but the message of her bright, cheery pop music has remained the same: Stay true to who you are and ignore the haters. That spirit endures on her lead single, the jovial “Still Don't Care,” the first tease of her forthcoming seventh full-length album, “Toy with Me,” out April 24.

And in true Trainor fashion, “Still Don't Care” was inspired by real life situations. “I was seeing a lot of hate all over the world, but I was getting a lot of hate when I started posting more pictures of ... my fitness journey and my health journey. And I didn't really expect that,” Trainor told The Associated Press. “I would get really upset at comments and I was like, ‘I wish I didn't feel like this. I wish I didn't give them so much power.'

“And so, when I write songs, I always write in the perspective of how I wish I thought, like ‘All About That Bass.' I didn't feel like that when I wrote it,” she continued. “And all my self-love anthems. But when I perform them and I see how it affects other people, I start believing them.”

“Still Don't Care” is yet another example, with its maximalist, ‘80s pop production and choir courtesy of Pentatonix's Scott Hoying. Her mom, brother and sister-in-law contribute background vocals on it as well — perhaps softening the song's gloves-up approach to combating online hate. “You could tear me apart,” Trainor sings. “But I sleep well at night.”




It's the first taste of “Toy with Me,” which Trainor teases will have a few self-love bops, songs to excise her anger through and lots of familial love. “The only features I have right now in this moment are my kids, Riley and Barry, because I wrote them a beautiful song, the only, like, slower song. It's called ‘Little One' and it's about how I wish they could stay little forever,” she said, smiling. “When I play it, Riley goes, ‘Oh, this is my song. Play my song!' It's literally my lullaby for them. And at the end of the song they say, ‘I love you, Mama,' and it's just the cutest thing ever. And that's when everyone's crying.”

Trainor said she worked on the album for eight months. “I exhausted myself, and I went a little too hard. I got excited to be home with the kids and work on my songs, but then I definitely, I overdid it, and my body started doing weird things, giving me signals. Like, my tongue started burning one day. And I was like, ‘What's this?' And it wouldn't go away forever. And the dentist was like, ‘Oh, you're stressed,'” she recalled.

Songwriting, too, was a challenge. “I usually write a song in one day and I'm done with it, but each song on this album took, like, months to finish,” she said. “So that was the only difference from this album than any other album I've done.”

A lot of that was because she enlisted songwriters she's never worked with before — people who would push her to make the song the best it could be — challenges she welcomed with open arms. 

The work is fulfilling, and so she continues: Trainor will also embark on a North American tour in 2026 with openers Icona Pop. The Get in Girl tour kicks off June 12 at the Pine Knob Music Theatre in Clarkston, Michigan, and ends Aug. 15 at Los Angeles' Kia Forum.

Along the way, she'll hit Toronto, Cincinnati, St. Louis, New York, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Cleveland, Houston, Denver, Salt Lake City, Seattle, San Francisco, San Diego, Phoenix and many more.

Trainor's last tour, the Timeless Tour, marked her first in seven years. It proved to Trainor that she can do this thing again. “I'm not absolutely petrified like I was for the Timeless Tour,” she said. “I know I can survive it and it can be really fun.”

After an American Express pre-sale, tickets will become available to the general public on Nov. 21, at 10 a.m. local time.

DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin joins Saturday in America to discuss the economic impact of the government shutdown on TSA workers as they continue to work without pay and growing anti-ICE protests around the country.

A transgender Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officer in Virginia is suing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), accusing it of sex discrimination over a new policy that bars transgender agents from conducting security screening pat-downs, according to a federal lawsuit.

Danielle Mittereder, a transgender woman and TSA officer at Dulles International Airport, filed the lawsuit Friday claiming the new policy violates civil rights law, according to The Associated Press.

A TSA spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the new policy states that only male officers can perform pat-downs on male passengers and only female officers can perform pat-downs on female passengers.

The rule applies regardless of an officer's gender identity or transition status.

The spokesperson said that the rule change was implemented to comply with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump on Jan. 20. That order, titled ""Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,"" declared that the federal government will recognize only two sexes — male and female — defined by biological sex ""at conception.""

Until February, TSA assigned work consistent with officers' gender identity under a 2021 management directive, the agency said. 

""Male Transportation Security Officers will conduct pat-down procedures on male passengers and female Transportation Security Officers will conduct pat-down procedures on female passengers, based on operational needs,"" the statement reads.

According to internal documents obtained by the AP, transgender officers will also no longer serve as a TSA-required witness when a traveler elects to have a pat-down conducted in a private screening area.

Mittereder claims in the lawsuit that transgender officers are also barred from using restrooms that align with their gender identity, arguing the restrictions block promotions, specialized certifications and core job duties.

""Solely because she is transgender, TSA now prohibits plaintiff from conducting core functions of her job, impedes her advancement to higher-level positions and specialized certifications, excludes her from TSA-controlled facilities and subjects her identity to unwanted and undue scrutiny each workday,"" the complaint reads, according to the AP.

Mittereder's attorney, Jonathan Puth, called TSA's policy ""terribly demeaning and 100% illegal,"" according to the AP.

DHS pushed back on assertions by some legal experts that the policy is discriminatory.

""Does the AP want female travelers to be subjected to pat-downs by male TSA officers?"" Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a written response to the outlet. 

""What a useless and fundamentally dangerous idea, to prioritize mental delusion over the comfort and safety of American travelers,"" McLaughlin added.

Fox News Digital also reached out to DHS for comment.

Fox News host Jimmy Failla and guests highlight former first lady Michelle Obama's new podcast and discuss rumors surrounding her and former President Barack Obama on 'Fox News Saturday Night.'

Former first lady Michelle Obama revealed on a recent episode of her podcast that she was left infuriated by a moment on Air Force One in 2009 when she debated whether to wear Bermuda shorts while on vacation — which ultimately led to controversy. 

""The fact that we had to spend time thinking about that kind of stuff in ways that my husband didn't — it was really infuriating,"" Obama said during an episode on her podcast, ""IMO With Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson,"" which she co-hosts with her brother. ""Then an article, a negative article, still happened."" 

The former first lady explained that in August 2009 she and the former president were set to depart Air Force One for a hike in the Grand Canyon while on their first vacation since the inauguration earlier that year. While she fretted over what attire would be appropriate for a first lady and not draw public criticism, Barack Obama did not need to put effort into thinking about his outfit, she recounted. 

""It was 100 degrees,"" Michelle Obama remembered of the conversation. ""Barack — I was like, 'Well, what are you wearing?' He was like, 'Well, I'm gonna throw on some sneakers, I'm gonna take my jacket off and roll my sleeves up' because that's what men can do. White shirt, no collar, no tie. That was how he changed.""

Michelle Obama said she debated whether to wear hiking shorts or a dress before landing on wearing Bermuda shorts. 

""I can't wear hiking shorts there, and I can't wear a dress to hike,"" she said. ""That would be crazy. People would call me 'disconnected' and 'un-American.' I'm at the Grand Canyon in a tea-length dress with flats? I was like, 'That's not how people go to the Grand Canyon.'""

""I eventually opted for the thing that felt mostly me,"" Michelle Obama continued. ""And it was the Bermuda shorts. Because if we're going on a hike, this is how a normal person would go on a hike.""

The former first lady did face backlash for the attire, as pundits at the time criticized that a first lady wearing shorts while departing Air Force One was too casual, with outlets running headlines such as, ""Who Wears Short Shorts? Michelle Obama,"" ""First lady's shorts draw some long, hard looks,"" and ""Michelle Obama: The Shorts Heard Round the World.""

Michelle Obama said in 2013 that she would not wear shorts again on Air Force One after the 2009 outfit caused ""a huge stink."" She explained at the time that she made the more relaxed choice because ""we're on vacation.""

First lady Melania Trump also has faced backlash over her wardrobe attire, including in 2017 when she wore a baseball cap and jeans to visit Texas after Hurricane Harvey that was viewed by some critics as too casual, and again in 2018 when she wore a green jacket while on a trip to visit the border that read, ""I really don't care. Do u?""

Melania Trump later told the media she wore the jacket as a message to the liberal media and other critics: ""I want to show them that I don't care,"" she told ABC News in 2018.

Kai Trump, the granddaughter of President Donald Trump, explains how her love for golf, which she will be playing at the University of Miami in 2026, was influenced by her grandfather.

President Donald Trump's granddaughter, Kai, is at Pelican Golf Club in Belleair, Florida, to make her LPGA debut this week.

The 18-year-old received a sponsorship exemption for The ANNIKA, given to emerging golfers to showcase their talents.

Ahead of her big weekend, Trump said she got advice from none other than Grandpa himself, who kept it short and sweet.

""Go out there and have fun. Just don't get nervous,"" she said.

Tiger Woods, who is currently dating Trump's mother, Vanessa — Don Jr.'s ex-wife —, also gave Trump advice.

""I mean, he is the best golfer in the entire world. I would say that. And even better person,"" she said. ""He told me to go out there and have fun and just go with the flow. Whatever happens, happens.""

Trump played a practice round with Annika Sorenstam, the host of the tournament that bears her name, and the LPGA legend gave the youngster nothing but praise.

""I was talking to her about my tendencies and said, ‘What are your tendencies?' And she went off, ‘this is what I do, and I'm trying to do that.' She's really interested in just getting better and learning about her swing…"" she said, via the Golf Channel. ""Just the excitement of learning and getting better, I thought that was pretty cool. I was trying to remember if I was 18, and I would play with somebody, if I would dare to ask a question. I probably would've been super quiet.""

""Going out there and playing a big course and environment like this, I'm sure she's used to a lot of people looking at her and analyzing everything,"" Sorenstam added. ""One thing that's different this year is I've never seen so many Secret Service people around here; I feel super safe, that's another thing. ... I just don't know how she does it honestly. To be 18 years old and hear all the comments, she must be super tough on the inside. I'm sure we can all relate what it's like to get criticism here and there, but she gets it a thousand times. So, that's why I just want to give her a break, come out here and have fun. We want her to feel like family here, and I want her to feel welcome.

""I mean, give this girl a chance, right?""

Nelly Korda is the reigning champ of The ANNIKA, also winning the event in 2021 and 2022.

Trump has gained a following on social media, mostly through YouTube, and recently posted a video of herself playing with her grandfather at Trump National Golf Club, Washington, D.C., and the two of them attending the Ryder Cup.

""I just don't view it as him being the president. I view it as, he's my grandpa. We're gonna go out there and play golf,"" Kai said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital. ""We play golf all the time. It's nothing new.""

In that interview, Trump reiterated her goal of going pro.

Andrew Gwaivangmin, the executive secretary of the Nigeria Evangelical Missions Association, says Christians are ""excited"" that President Donald Trump is prioritizing efforts to stop violence against believers after years of bloodshed.

A Nigerian mission leader said President Donald Trump's push to end the violence against Christians in his country is an ""answered prayer.""

Andrew Gwaivangmin, the executive secretary of the Nigeria Evangelical Missions Association, told Fox News in an interview that Christians are ""excited"" Trump is prioritizing efforts to stop the killings of believers after years of bloodshed.

""We have cried out to the international community to force our government to do the right thing. This is the only time that America is focusing its attention on this violence in Nigeria. So, as a Christian, I'm excited,"" he said.

""I'm happy that Trump is focusing on ensuring that this violence stops. Anybody who doesn't support the intervention by Trump, clearly, you know that the person doesn't understand the reality and the gravity of the violence that have occurred in the north of Nigeria over the last 10 years.""

RAP STAR NICKI MINAJ THANKS TRUMP FOR ADDRESSING PERSECUTION OF CHRISTIANS IN NIGERIA

Trump threatened in a November Truth Social post to send U.S. troops ""guns-a-blazing"" into the most populous country in Africa to ""completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities."" The president also threatened to stop all aid and assistance if the violence continued.

Nigerian President Bola Tinubu responded to Trump's threat, writing on social media that his administration has worked with Christian and Muslim leaders to address security challenges affecting citizens across all faiths and regions.

""The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians,"" he wrote on X.

""Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so. Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it.""

Open Doors, an international Christian organization that supports persecuted believers, said attacks are most common in the northern, Muslim-majority states of Nigeria but have started spreading into the Middle Belt and farther south.

The organization stated that Christians are at risk from targeted attacks by Islamist militants, including Fulani fighters and Boko Haram. Women are often killed and subjected to sexual violence.

Gwaivangmin told Fox News that many of his organization's missionaries have been attacked and killed.

""We've had casualties. We've had to bury our missionaries. Our missionaries have to directly relocate. In fact, I can tell you that today, we have hundreds of widows whose husbands have been killed in their field as missionaries,"" he said.

""It's not easy to be a Christian in Nigeria, and sadly, our government doesn't seem to care to hold people accountable for all the killings, the mass killings that occur in this country,"" Gwaivangmin added.

The leader of the largest global missions organization for the Nigerian Christian church said he would welcome U.S. military involvement to help end the violence. He believes having American boots on the ground isn't realistic, but hopes the United States can provide logistical support and equipment to strengthen Nigeria's forces.

Fox News correspondent Brooke Taylor details the Louisiana manhunt for a bank robber who allegedly faked a limp in a broad daylight heist on ‘America Reports.'

A man who limped into a Louisiana bank with a cane and sprinted out seconds later with cash in hand is wanted by police.

Surveillance video from a Fidelity Bank branch in Slidell, just outside New Orleans, captured the bizarre ruse.

In the video, the man hobbles through the doors wearing a neck brace and clutching a short cane before sliding a note to the teller.

Moments later, he stuffs a stack of cash into his fanny pack, then suddenly ditches the limp and bolts out the door.

The robbery happened shortly before 4 p.m. Friday, Nov. 7, police said. According to the Slidell Police Department, the suspect demanded money while shouting that it was a robbery before fleeing on foot, this time without any sign of injury.

""The suspect entered the bank appearing to be handicapped, walking with a fake limp, a cane, and a neck brace,"" police said in a Facebook post. ""He then fled the scene, without a limp, with an undisclosed amount of cash.""

A spokesperson for the Slidell Police Department told Fox News Digital the man's appearance immediately raised suspicions among bank employees.

""He walked in as a red flag, just out of pure appearance,"" the spokesperson said. ""Everything he was dressed in, from the hat to the neck brace, to the cane, to the multiple layers of clothing, to the face mask. As an employee of a financial institution, somebody comes in where you can barely make out their identity — that's a red flag.""

Before staff could process what was happening, the robbery was underway.

""They were taken back, they were shook up. Thankfully, it went the way it did, he didn't cause any harm to anybody,"" the spokesperson said.

Police said the suspect sat inside for several minutes, waiting for customers to leave before making his move.

""He went in there and sat around for a couple of minutes because there were other patrons of the bank present,"" the spokesperson said. ""Once he was alone with the tellers, he slid a note. The victim didn't even get a chance to read it before he started screaming, ‘This is a robbery!' — just like something you'd see in a movie.""

The suspect grabbed the money, snatched back the note and ran.

The spokesperson said that while bank robberies are increasingly rare, this one stood out because of the suspect's elaborate deception.

""We've dealt with bank robberies since the beginning of time,"" the spokesperson said. ""It's not too common anymore just because of technology, but every now and then you get some bold person who thinks they can pull off a heist. The pure elaborate game plan that he went in there with — acting like he was crippled, going to that extent, and then just taking the money and running away, literally no injury — was something else.""

The video ends with the man sprinting through the parking lot, disappearing from sight and the limp completely gone.

Officers and K-9 units searched nearby neighborhoods, but investigators believe the man may have escaped the area in a vehicle.

The suspect is described as a Black male wearing a gray tracksuit, bucket hat, neck brace, clear fanny pack and a face mask.

Police are urging anyone who recognizes the man, or who may have captured him on home security cameras along Choctaw Drive, to contact the Slidell Police Department at 985-643-3131.

Officials said the suspect remains on the loose as investigators analyze new leads.

America Reports' panelists analyze the public fallout over the shutdown deal in the Democratic Party.

FIRST ON FOX: House GOP leaders are looking to kick off next week in high gear to make up for the six weeks they spent out of session during the government shutdown.

With the end of Congress' 42-day fiscal standoff in sight, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told Fox News Digital that House lawmakers will be faced with an accelerated schedule to accomplish the GOP's priorities for this term.

""I wanted to rework the schedule to create more time to make up for what happened during the shutdown, and the fact that there were a lot of bills that stacked up that we planned to bring to the floor in October that weren't able to go,"" he said in an interview on Tuesday night.

Priorities for next week include legislation to help reduce federal restrictions on liquefied natural gas (LNG), and a bill aimed at expanding refining capacity in a bid to reduce soaring energy costs.

Measures aimed at D.C. are also expected to see votes, including a bill that D.C.'s pretrial release and detention processes require mandatory pretrial detention for defendants charged with violent crimes. 

Another bill expected to get a vote next week would undo local ordinances that Republicans say place burdensome barriers on the Metropolitan Police Department.

A largely symbolic measure to denounce socialism in the U.S. is also on next week's schedule.

Lawmakers will be expected to work long into the night in a departure from their traditional day-to-day in D.C. Votes will be scheduled in the evenings when lawmakers have normally departed Capitol Hill for other events.

THE 5 LONGEST GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS IN HISTORY: WHAT HAPPENED, HOW THEY ENDED

Scalise also noted the House would have a five-day legislative week from Monday through Friday, rather than the more traditional four days in D.C.

More time will also be allotted during the day for House committees to conduct hearings and advance their legislation, something that has not been done on Capitol Hill since Sept. 19.

""We're going to do that for the next few weeks until we catch up on the time that we missed when everybody was back in their districts,"" Scalise said.

The latter point is critical considering Congress will be reckoning with several key priorities in the coming months.

The bill to end the government shutdown, expected to pass the House on Wednesday, kicks the majority of fiscal year (FY) 2026 federal spending to a Jan. 30 deadline. It would also authorize funding for three of Congress' 12 annual spending bills for FY 2026.

However, it will be an uphill battle for both the Senate and House appropriations committees to strike their remaining spending deals by then.

""There are nine remaining bills, and we'd like to get all of those done in the next few weeks. And so, [House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla.] and his appropriators will be working overtime as well,"" Scalise said.

Congress also still has to find a bipartisan compromise on the federal government's annual defense policy bill, called the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).

""There have been a lot of negotiations ongoing. I think we're getting close on the NDAA,"" Scalise said.

Scalise said Republicans would also be busy at work on a new Farm Bill, legislation that sets agricultural priorities as well as federal food policies for urban, suburban and rural areas across the country, as well as a highway bill — legislation that authorizes policy for surface infrastructure like roads, bridges and rail lines nationwide.

""A lot of those bills have been very active in the committee process. They just haven't gotten a lot of attention nationally during the shutdown. But the committees have been working, especially the chairman, to try to get those bills ready to move,"" he said.

""And so we will have a lot of big ticket items that are important to our America First agenda ready to go. And that's why we're going to just add more floor time to be able to get all of it done by the end of this year.""

But in order to get all those ""big-ticket items"" done, the House will first need to pass the Senate's bipartisan bill to end the government shutdown.

Asked if his chamber had the votes to do so, Scalise said, ""I'm very hopeful we will.""

""I'm very confident our members are really eager to get back to a full House schedule. Many of them have been working overtime in their districts to mop up the mess Democrats created during the shutdown,"" he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","From ‘leverage' to lies, Democrats were always responsible for shutdown suffering","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3882362/democrats-leverage-government-shutdown-political-agenda/","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT","

Democrats tried their hardest to convince the country that the government shutdown was the fault of President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. They relied on every political weapon at their disposal. They used their accomplices in the media. They used celebrities to advance their political narratives. They unleashed their social media army of trolls to constantly smear the GOP in hopes of persuading the public that the Republicans were responsible for the shutdown.

Yet, in the end, like so many times before with Democrats, they were the ones doing the very thing they accused Republicans of doing. And Trump and the Republicans broke them from continuing their harmful and divisive political games.

Consider the words of House Minority Whip Rep. Katherine Clark (D-MA), who said the quiet part out loud. During an interview on Fox News, Clark admitted — perhaps mistakenly, perhaps in a moment of rare political truth from a left-wing politician —  that the government shutdown was an opportunity for Democrats to gain political leverage, even if people were suffering.

“Shutdowns are terrible,” Clark said. “And of course, there will be families that are going to suffer. We take that responsibility very seriously. But it is one of the few leverage times we have.”

Leverage. Democrats repeatedly went on their soapboxes and preached about the shutdown hurting people when, in reality, the only thing they cared about was political power and using perceived “leverage” to amass more of it. They didn't care about any suffering. They gleefully accepted it and viewed it as necessary collateral damage. It is similar to the Democrats' antics during the COVID-19 pandemic when they openly admitted they were taking advantage of the worldwide emergency to benefit their political agenda.

It's all part of their “never let a crisis go to waste” political strategy, a sentiment embraced by Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC).

“This is a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision,” Clyburn said in the middle of the health crisis during the deadly pandemic. And if they were willing to let people die during a pandemic to advance a political agenda, clearly, they had no problem with people enduring hardships during a government shutdown. And so Democrats went on media circuits and talk shows and repeatedly lied to the people over and over and over again.

Consider their rhetoric. For weeks, a common refrain by Democratic politicians was that the shutdown was due to Republicans. “Republicans control the presidency, the House, and the Senate,” they would say. This message was disseminated through every available medium. Republicans held the majority and were the ones who could and should reopen the government.

So, Republicans did.

It was never true, of course, and Democrats knew it all along. Hence, Republicans needed eight Democrats to join them. They were, as usual, lying to the public. And, when Republicans did use their majority to vote to open the government, it was the Democrats, once again, trying to sabotage those efforts and obstruct the government from opening. Fortunately, eight Democrats had enough decency and common sense to go against their party's line.

WHY DID DEMOCRATS FIGHT SO LONG — BEFORE CAVING?

This stunt should cost the Democrats, politically. They should lose a ton of credibility with the public. They should be deemed untrustworthy. Their narrative, even before the shutdown began, was dishonest and deceptive, predicated on advancing a political agenda rather than prioritizing the welfare of the people. 

Typically, they would weaponize their accomplices in the media to influence and persuade public opinion. They used it the last time there was a government shutdown when Trump was president. It was a tactic Democrats used this time, too. The difference was that Trump and Republicans were privy to their tactics and did not cave. They stood firm and refused to acquiesce. They knew they were on the right side of history on this and were not going to surrender. 

Unfortunately, with the monopoly in legacy media, the truth will get convoluted, and the narrative will become misrepresented. The Democrats' lemmings and foot soldiers will try to position this as a political win, even though it was an embarrassing defeat. But if there is ever any justice, it is that the people, especially those affected by the shutdown, will realize any pain they endured during this time was due to Democratic political games.

THE CHANGING HISTORY OF THE SHUTDOWN. Why did Senate Democrats shut the government down for more than 40 days? Now that the standoff is over, it appears a number of Democrats cannot agree among themselves on why they did what they did.

The stated reason for the shutdown, of course, was the Democratic demand that Republicans extend taxpayer-paid, Covid-era “emergency” subsidies for people who purchase health insurance through Obamacare. Democrats created the subsidies, on top of the massive subsidies that already exist under the Affordable Care Act, to help Americans pay for coverage during the pandemic. The 2022 Democratic legislation called for “emergency” subsidies to remain in effect until Dec. 31, 2025. Now, of course, the “emergency” is long over, and the subsidies' expiration date is fast approaching. So Democrats, who are also worried about hefty price increases of Obamacare coverage in general, came up with a plan to demand that the “emergency” subsidies be extended, or they would shut down the government. Republicans offered a “clean” bill to fund the government; Democrats filibustered, and the shutdown came.

But why did it come? For over 40 days, Democrats pounded on the healthcare theme. Every day, every waking hour, they accused Republicans of taking away healthcare from millions of Americans. That's why Democrats simply had to shut down the government. “We're in a government shutdown, and you may be asking yourself, ‘How the hell did we get here?'” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer after one week. “Donald Trump and the Republican Party are hellbent on taking healthcare away from 16 million people.” On the House side, Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said, “The government remains closed because Republicans have zero interest in actually providing affordable healthcare to everyday Americans.” And so it went, day after day.

It was never going to work. This newsletter has explained it many times, but the short version is that the party that attaches conditions to reopening the government is the party that loses the shutdown. As a shutdown drags on, the public wants the government to open first, and any policy negotiations to take place later.

So now, the shutdown is nearly over, and the action has turned to Democrats pointing fingers of blame at each other. Progressives throughout the party are angry at the eight “moderate” Senate Democrats who abandoned the blockade and voted with Republicans to move forward on funding the government.

And then there is the debate over how the shutdown came about. Here is what the New York Times‘ Ezra Klein, who is well-connected among progressive Democrats, wrote this week: “Democrats said the shutdown was about the subsidies, but for most of them, it wasn't. It was about Trump's authoritarianism. It was about showing their base, and themselves, that they could fight back….The Affordable Care Act subsidies emerged as the shutdown demand because they could keep the caucus sufficiently united.”

Whoa. It wasn't about the subsidies? And when Democrats said, over and over and over, that it was about the subsidies, they weren't telling the truth? That appears to be the case, according to the “dozen or so House and Senate Democrats” Klein spoke to.

If Democrats were really targeting “Trump's authoritarianism,” then what, specifically, did they mean by that? You can bet they would put the administration's immigration enforcement high on the list, but that probably wouldn't be a very effective topic for a shutdown. After all, a recent Harvard-Harris poll found that 79% of Americans favor “deporting immigrants who are here illegally and have committed crimes,” and 54% favor “deporting all immigrants who are here illegally.” Shut down the government for that?

What about other manifestations of Trump's “authoritarianism”? Sending the National Guard to fight crime in some high-crime areas? Blowing up drug-running boats in international waters? The prosecution or investigation of John Bolton, James Comey, and John Brennan? It's hard to imagine shutting down the government over any or all of those issues. 

Maybe an issue, like affordability? Certainly, that's an important issue with voters; it played a big role in last week's Democratic electoral victories. Democrats could certainly argue that President Donald Trump hasn't done enough to bring down prices. The problem is, Democrats would have a huge glasshouse problem if they were to shut down the government over prices. Which party presided over inflation that rose to 9.1%?

Apparently, if they had their choice, Senate Democrats would have launched a kind of everything bagel shutdown, based on a little bit of all their grievances against Trump's “authoritarianism.” But the party's more strategic minds decided to focus on healthcare. And so Democrats spent more than 40 days telling Americans that the government was shut down because Republicans wanted to take away their healthcare. In fact, it now appears the shutdown was more of a Democratic tantrum against Trump in search of a rationale.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Motion by Letitia James and James Comey cases fights to remove Lindsey Halligan","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/3883331/letitia-james-james-comey-motion-fights-remove-lindsey-halligan/","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

A federal judge is poised to hear arguments this week in a joint motion by former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James seeking to disqualify interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan from overseeing their criminal prosecutions in the Eastern District of Virginia. 

U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton sitting by designation from South Carolina to avoid conflicts in the district, will preside over the hearing Thursday morning. Currie has already ordered full grand jury transcripts for review, signaling an unusual level of scrutiny of what Halligan's role was before the indictments were handed up to her by grand jurors.

If the court takes the unusual step of removing Halligan, the question arises whether the indictments she obtained must also be dismissed or whether a replacement prosecutor would simply assume the case.

In respective filings unsealed Monday, Comey and James argue that Halligan's appointment was invalid and that her involvement taints the integrity of both prosecutions. They note that Halligan had never worked as a prosecutor before being appointed to lead the Eastern District of Virginia and that her predecessor, Erik Siebert, resigned under pressure after declining to pursue these same cases. Within days of being sworn in, Halligan secured a grand jury indictment against Comey, followed by an indictment against James weeks later.

Comey's lawyers argue that those circumstances demonstrate improper political influence over the Justice Department. They say Halligan's direct involvement in presenting the cases to the grand jury, rather than delegating to a line prosecutor, is a “structural defect” that makes the indictments void.

James's attorneys have made similar claims, calling her appointment “unlawful” and alleging she was placed in the job to target political opponents.

If the judge finds Halligan's appointment invalid, the Justice Department could be ordered to name a new prosecutor, but legal experts say dismissal of the indictments themselves would require a higher showing of prejudice or fundamental unfairness.

Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told the Washington Examiner that Halligan's personal role in obtaining the Comey indictment distinguishes her situation from other recent challenges to acting or interim U.S. attorneys. 

“It's unique in that she's the one who actually went into the grand jury to get the indictment,” Rahmani said. “Typically, the U.S. attorney is not personally handling the case. They're on the caption, but they're not even in the room.”

Rahmani said that the difference could complicate the outcome if Currie disqualifies Halligan. “The question is, if she's disqualified, is the grand jury indictment improper because she secured it herself? Would they have to reindict? Would there be a statute of limitations issue? That's what makes this case unique,” he said.

Even so, Rahmani said disqualification alone would not automatically void the indictments. “You'd need to show more than just a technical violation,” he said. “Even if she were unlawfully appointed, the defense has to show prejudice — that it was fundamentally unfair. That's a higher bar than simply removing her from the case.” He added that any order disqualifying or dismissing the prosecutions would likely trigger immediate appeals and could delay the current trial timelines.

The Comey case has also become entangled in a separate dispute over grand jury secrecy. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick, who oversees pretrial proceedings, rebuked prosecutors last week for what he described as an “indict first, investigate later” approach and ordered the government to produce late-September grand jury transcripts and audio for review.

Prosecutors, including Halligan and Department of Justice trial attorneys Tyler Lemons and Gabriel Diaz, quickly appealed to U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff, a Biden appointee, arguing that Fitzpatrick's order exceeded his authority and that Comey had not shown sufficient grounds to overcome grand jury secrecy. Nachmanoff largely upheld Fitzpatrick's discretion but sent the matter back for a more limited review of whether the defense has “particularized and factually based grounds” to justify disclosure.

At a brief status conference on Monday, the Justice Department agreed to provide all grand jury transcripts and audio for Fitzpatrick's private review, but not for Comey's defense team. Fitzpatrick said an in-camera review was necessary “to make an informed decision” about possible disclosure and will also consider an ex parte filing from Comey's lawyers describing alleged breaches of attorney-client privilege during the grand jury process, according to Law and Crime.

Comey's team argues those materials could show misconduct in Halligan's presentation to the grand jury, the first of her career, while prosecutors maintain that no privileged evidence was used and that nothing in the grand jury process supports dismissal.

Prosecutors have sought to bolster Halligan's standing, filing a certification on Nov. 3 that Attorney General Pam Bondi lawfully appointed Halligan as a special attorney on Sept. 22, the same day the Comey indictment was presented and ratified her grand jury actions to eliminate any procedural doubt.

Supporters, including Mike Davis, a close Trump ally and former chief judicial nominations counsel to Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), have defended Halligan's record. 

In a recent Federalist op-ed, Davis argued Halligan “proved her critics wrong” by filing evidence that he said “overwhelmingly demonstrates Comey's guilt,” including handwritten notes, emails sent under Comey's alias Reinhold Niebuhr, and communications with Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman that prosecutors allege show coordination with the media.

The Campaign for Accountability, a left-leaning watchdog group, filed complaints Tuesday with the Florida and Virginia state bars, urging Halligan's disbarment.

The group alleges she violated ethics rules by acting at Trump's direction and prosecuting cases that career officials deemed unsupportable. 

“The evidence appears to demonstrate that, absent President Trump's intervention, neither Mr. Comey nor Ms. James would have been indicted,” the complaint states.

Comey faces charges of making false statements and obstructing Congress for his 2020 Senate testimony about the FBI's handling of Hillary Clinton's private email investigation and related leaks to the media. He has pleaded not guilty and claims the prosecution stems from political motives rather than independent law enforcement.

James is charged with bank fraud for allegedly misrepresenting her intent to personally occupy a Virginia home purchased in 2020 with a $109,600 mortgage and allegedly acquiring nearly $20,000 in ill-gotten gains due to her alleged misrepresentation of her intent. She has pleaded not guilty and argues that the case represents an unlawful abuse of power.

Both defendants have so far focused their defenses on challenging Halligan's appointment and claiming selective or vindictive prosecution, rather than disputing the substance of the allegations themselves.

Currie has required the government to submit the full grand jury transcript ahead of Thursday's hearing, indicating close attention to Halligan's role in securing the indictments. Fitzpatrick, meanwhile, is completing his in-camera review of the grand jury materials and an ex parte defense submission regarding alleged breaches of privilege.

FLORIDA AND VIRGINIA PRESSURED TO INVESTIGATE LINDSEY HALLIGAN OVER PROSECUTING COMEY AND JAMES

The federal courthouse in Alexandria was closed Tuesday for the Veterans Day holiday, but a ruling from Fitzpatrick on whether any grand jury materials can be shared with Comey's defense team could come as early as Wednesday. 

Trials for both Comey and James remain set for January in the Eastern District of Virginia's “rocket docket,” assuming no delays or appeals force the dates to be pushed back.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The oral arguments before the Supreme Court last week added another level of debate to the ongoing arguments among everyone interested in President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Until last week, most of the arguments about tariffs have swirled around the economic impact of the president's tariffs. But the arguments before the court had very little to do with huge revenues the tariffs are undeniably bringing into the federal Treasury, their impact on GDP, or the balance of trade.

Rather, the debate before “The Nine” was an extended discussion between the justices and able counsel on both sides about whether the president has the power to do what he has already done and no doubt plans to continue to do unless the Supreme Court tells him to stop.

A GOOD DAY FOR THE SEPARATION OF POWERS IN THE SUPREME COURT

First, a prediction. My guess is that a majority of the Court, and quite possibly all nine of the justices, will leave the tariffs in place pending the results of a remand of the proceeding to a district court for fact-finding outlined by the majority. Such fact finding should sort through and categorize all of the tariffs which the president has imposed to date (and all those to be imposed prior to the next ruling of the district court.)

When that fact-finding is done, a ruling that separates the tariffs into categories should emerge, and don't be surprised if the Supreme Court provides direction on those categories. One “bucket” of Trump tariffs should be those which involve nations that are obviously hostile to the U.S., most obviously the People's Republic of China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela and Cuba. The “alliance of tyrants” are all enemies of the United States, and every president needs broad an unreviewable authority to impose tariffs and even absolute trade embargos on such nations when the president concludes the tariffs and embargoes are necessary.

A second “bucket” are those Trump tariffs which have already yielded agreements on trade between the U.S. and the other nations.  The court ought to be very slow to upend such agreements whether or not they think the president had the authority to impose them under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

The third and final bucket is the everything else bucket, and odds are the District Court will fill that to the rim and declare them all void as either a “major rule” that did not proceed through the minimum requirements of regulatory rule-making or even (perhaps, not very likely, but perhaps) an unconstitutional exercise of tariff and/or taxing power committed by Article I to the Congress which cannot be delegated away.

The “non-delegation doctrine” was employed to strike down two laws enacted by Congress in 1935, and went into the witness protection program thereafter. Don't expect a surprise return from hiding.

The regulatory agencies to which vast powers have been delegated by Congress are being corralled in their legislating via rule-making and guidance letters in slow but steady fashion. So I expect IEEPA will not be struck down, but that its future reach will be significantly limited, but not for tariffs on nations that threaten America or for agreements reached in the months prior to the next ruling of the District Court which gets the remanded proceedings.

A second prediction: The Federal Circuit will get a chance to review that second round of proceedings before the District Court and will tweak the findings and the language of any rule set that emerges, and then the highest court will get its second shot at the biggest ball of yarn in the world. Don't be surprised by a third round of such proceedings.

Recall the many back-and-forths between the branches on the subject of the treatment of unlawful combatants in the Global War on Terror, and the (not done yet) up and down the federal courts of all the proceedings around the terrorists held at Guantanamo Bay? We are still in the judicial wilderness there and it's doubtful we will ever emerge from it.

The tariff power under the IEEPA, by contrast, demands an answer and a pretty specific set of rules regarding its future deployment. But not just yet. What is allowed and why, what must be undone and why, are questions that require answers. Just not speedy ones.

The court could very well demand of the president's lawyers a country-by-country account of why the tariff imposed was necessary to deal with which emergency.  Other questions could be posed by the Supreme Court that the District Court would have to sort through and answer in the search for “limiting principles” that put fences around the powers conferred by IEEPA.

That the nine would agree on the need for limiting principles of some sort seems obvious to me, or else the Congress would be empowered to delegate all of its duties to legislate to the president. Justice Neil Gorsuch hammered on this possibility with Solicitor General John Sauer in one of many interesting exchanges that occurred during the arguments. All of the justices should be concerned with maintaining separation of powers between the three branches.

But they also have to take judicial notice of all the consequences of the tariffs already imposed, and not just the revenue raised —which has been immense— but also the national security aspects of many of the tariffs, most notably vis-a-vis China.

SUPREME COURT COULD SAVE TRUMP BY OVERTURNING HIS TARIFFS

Prudence dictates that the court move carefully if it intends to impose “black-letter” limits on the powers that the IEEPA gives the president.

Very few people can pull the tablecloth out from under the setting of a  Thanksgiving feast without destroying the dishes, the food and the mood. The caution that keeps that trick out of almost all dining rooms should prevail here too. The majority of the Supreme Court will want, I suspect, to act with the prudence dictated by the complexity of the situation the vast array of consequences that the tariffs have already wrought.

Senate Democrats have little time to cobble together a bill extending premium Obamacare subsidies with no guarantee that the legislation can pass, a bitter pill to swallow after weeks spent fighting with Republicans over healthcare.

There are just three weeks when the Senate is in session before mid-December, when Republicans committed to holding a vote on the subsidies as part of a shutdown deal. The vote was a meager concession as Republicans are not willing to promise the bill will get through Congress or be signed into law.

But the vote at least leaves the door open to a breakthrough, and the Democrats who negotiated that deal are urging their caucus not to squander the opportunity.

“We have to write a version that is good for our values, that helps people, but is also designed to get some Republican votes,” said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), one of seven Senate Democrats to vote to reopen the government on Monday. “If we write this bill in that sweet spot, I think we got a really strong chance of getting it passed.”

Congressional Republicans have shown some willingness to extend the Obamacare subsidies, subject to new limitations on income and language, eliminating “phantom enrollees.” Senators from both parties also want to pass regulations on pharmacy benefit managers, meaning there is fertile ground for a grand bargain on healthcare before the end of the year.

“There are Democrats and Republicans who are both interested in trying to do something in the healthcare space,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) said. “And clearly, there is a need.”

Yet most Democrats lack trust in their GOP colleagues and believe they would not commit to extending the subsidies because there is no real interest among leadership or the White House. In the House, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) will not agree to hold the same vote on Obamacare subsidies as President Donald Trump has more recently begun to propose legislation that could only draw Republican support.

“The government shutting down seemed to be an opportunity to lead us to better policy, but it didn't work,” said Senate Minority Leader Dick Durbin (D-IL), another Senate Democrat who sided with Republicans on Monday. “It worked to this extent — health insurance became a big issue — and we get our day in court in December [with a vote]. But this government shutdown itself did not achieve that.”

For now, Democrats are looking to a bloc of centrist Republicans interested in hammering out a healthcare deal. 

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), a retiring lawmaker known for his bipartisan deal-making, echoed other centrists in advocating a one-year extension coupled with a one- or two-year ramp-down. He made the case that a three-year plan would avoid midterm election drama yet not cut off benefits “cold turkey.”

“I don't think you'll see a straight one-year extension, because does anybody really want to go through this drama next year during an election cycle?” Tillis said. “You have to give people time to react, and this sort of cold turkey that people are going through now, they couldn't possibly plan for some of these increases.”

Kaine, for his part, expressed optimism that common ground could be found when it comes to “means testing … so that the benefits are really to low- and moderate-income people.”

Democrats concede that, with the shutdown behind them, they have limited leverage to extend the Obamacare subsidies. Republicans are generally reluctant to prop up a law passed by the Democrats and feel that the premium subsidies, a product of the coronavirus pandemic, should not have been reauthorized.

However, Republicans are also aware that healthcare could become a liability for them in the midterm elections next year, as out-of-pocket premiums are set to increase for more than 20 million people with plans through the Obamacare marketplace.

Multiple rank-and-file Republicans are beginning to draft their own legislative proposals on how to address the rising cost of healthcare, while the top Republicans on the relevant committees are also expected to be engaged.

SENATE PASSES BILL TO END GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, TEEING UP HOUSE RETURN

Sen. Andy Kim (D-NJ) was among the frustrated Democrats to lambast the shutdown-ending funding deal, calling it a “disgrace” and a “setback” while also urging the party to “regroup.”

“In the same chamber where the nation watched Senator McCain show courage in saving the ACA, now we see a vote that will lead to millions losing healthcare,” Kim said in a post on X. “There is no excusing this. It's a huge setback. But we must regroup, expose the cruelty of Trump's actions, and never stop fighting for the right of healthcare for every American.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

New email correspondence released by House Oversight Committee Democrats revealed conversations held by late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein about President Donald Trump, alleging that the president “spent hours at my house” and “of course he knew about the girls.”

The Democrats released email correspondence between Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as author Michael Wolff, on Wednesday morning, hours before Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva's (D-AZ) swearing-in ceremony, after which she will provide the 218th signature on a discharge petition to release the Epstein files.

In a private email with Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence after being convicted of conspiring in Epstein's sex trafficking ring, Epstein allegedly said the “dog that hasn't barked is trump … [victim name] spent hours at my house with him, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc.”

Maxwell allegedly responded, “I have been thinking about that.”

In another email, Epstein allegedly told Wolff, who has written several books about Trump, that “of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”

“[Victim] mara lago. [identifier]. Trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever,” the full correspondence allegedly reads. “Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”

In another email exchange between Wolff and Epstein, the author allegedly told the financier he heard CNN was “planning to ask Trump tonight about his relationship with you–either on air or in scrum afterwards.”

Epstein allegedly responded, “If we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?”

Wolff allegedly said he thought Epstein should let Trump “hang himself.”

“If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency,” Wolff said, according to the released email. “You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt.”

“Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime,” Wolff allegedly added.

Trump has repeatedly insisted he has committed no wrongdoing and has called the Epstein saga a “hoax,” leading to outrage from some of his fellow congressional Republicans and much of his conservative base.

The emails came from the estate of Epstein, part of 23,000 documents that the committee is reviewing as part of its larger investigation into the Epstein files.

The files have become a point of contention on Capitol Hill, as all House Democrats and four House Republicans have signed a petition to release all information related to Epstein in the Justice Department's possession immediately.

“The more Donald Trump tries to cover up the Epstein files, the more we uncover,” House Oversight Committee ranking member Robert Garcia (D-CA) said. “These latest emails and correspondence raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the President. The Department of Justice must fully release the Epstein files to the public immediately. The Oversight Committee will continue pushing for answers and will not stop until we get justice for the victims.”

However, House Republican leadership and other conservatives have insisted that the petition is not necessary, as the Oversight Committee conducts a thorough investigation into Epstein's crimes that will release information to the public without harming the victims.

A House GOP Oversight Committee spokesperson told the Washington Examiner that Democrats continue to “carelessly cherry-pick documents to generate clickbait that is not grounded in the facts.”

“The Epstein Estate has produced over 20,000 pages of documents on Thursday, yet Democrats are once again intentionally withholding records that name Democrat officials,” the spokesperson argued. “Democrats should stop politicizing this investigation and focus on delivering transparency, accountability, and justice for the survivors.”

The House GOP Oversight Committee also accused Democrats of covering up names when the Epstein estate did not censor them in the redacted documents provided to the committee in a post on X.

“It's because this victim, Virginia Giuffre, publicly said that she never witnessed wrongdoing by President Trump,” the committee said. “Democrats are trying to create a fake narrative to slander President Trump. Shame on them.”

Why did Democrats cover up the name when the Estate didn't redact it in the redacted documents provided to the committee?It's because this victim, Virginia Giuffre, publicly said that she never witnessed wrongdoing by President Trump. Democrats are trying to create a fake… https://t.co/vd7gw3kJl0

Democrats have accused Republicans of wanting to protect Trump and pedophiles, a major argument as the caucus bashed House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) for weeks for not swearing in Grijalva during the House's nearly two-month recess during the government shutdown.

Grijalva has said for weeks that she will provide the 218th signature on the discharge petition to release the Epstein files. Reps. Thomas Massie (R-KY), Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Nancy Mace (R-SC), and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) are the four Republican lawmakers who signed the petition.

Massie, who is co-leading the bill with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) and has been a constant thorn in the side of the Republican trifecta, has said he will not budge. However, eyes will be on the three female lawmakers to see whether they will remove their names from the petition to avoid it being brought to the floor for what is likely to be a politically challenging vote for many Republicans.

The White House has been whipping the three signatories to remove their names to no avail.

Mace told the Hill that she will not remove her name from the petition. Greene has been incredibly vocal about releasing all the information regardless of whose names are in the files. Boebert has previously indicated she will not remove her name despite pressure from the White House.

JOHNSON TO SWEAR IN ADELITA GRIJALVA SEVEN WEEKS AFTER ELECTION WIN

House leadership has said it will not stop the bill from hitting the floor: Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) told the Washington Examiner he will not break precedent and whip against privileged motions, Johnson said in early October he will not block a floor vote on the bill, and House Rules Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) said her panel won't turn off the petition or seek to jam it in the panel's deliberations.

The latter, essentially sticking language in a rule to kill a petition, has been a tactic used by Republican leadership before to avoid votes they dislike. Most recently, they used it for Rep. Anna Paulina Luna's (R-FL) discharge petition on proxy voting for new parents.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A new book about Chernobyl's child victims shows the human cost of seeking technological dominance.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

On April 28, 1986, the Soviet news program Vremya made a 14-second announcement about an accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine. One of the plant's nuclear reactors had been damaged, the broadcaster said. Mitigation actions were being taken, aid to those affected was being provided, and a government commission had been formed. The rest of the Soviet Union hummed along, making plans for the upcoming May Day holiday.

Although I lived just 100 miles from the border with Ukraine, it took me three months to begin attaching faces and names to the incident. I was vacationing with my mother near Sochi, on the Black Sea, when a group of women and children entered our hotel. They were Chernobyltsy, “people of Chernobyl.” They had a startled air around them, and the mood in the hotel became tense: Most vacationers wanted to avoid the “radioactive” intruders. I was too young to be afraid, so I befriended a girl named Katya, a 5-year-old with remarkable dimples.

In the years that followed, as perestroika and glasnost revealed the scale of Chernobyl, I kept thinking about Katya, with whom I had played so obliviously on that pebble beach. Where did she go after that summer? Did she manage to stay healthy? Did she even get to grow up?

Decades later, the German historian Melanie Arndt set out to answer the same questions about kids like Katya. Her book Chernobyl Children, translated by Alastair Matthews, is a pioneering history of the event that focuses on what happened to its children by tracing an ongoing disaster that stemmed from the world superpowers' race for technological supremacy. After the accident, as Arndt demonstrates, the children of Chernobyl were failed by a state that prioritized its image over their safety, but aided by people around the planet who were waking up to their shared vulnerability in a post-industrial world. Born in a country that would soon vanish off the map, these children became accidental trailblazers of a new global condition: life in the shadow of catastrophes that cross borders and don't end when news cameras move on.

The word disaster suggests the inevitable, yet Chernobyl was anything but. In its three years of operation, the reactor that exploded, No. 4, had suffered numerous malfunctions and partial shutdowns, which were ignored by a typically bungling Soviet bureaucracy. A competition to outdo the United States in nuclear capacity had spurred the construction of power plants at a breakneck pace. Ukraine alone hosted four, despite its abundant energy from rivers and coal fields. Government leaders pushed a “peaceful atom” propaganda campaign, which cast nuclear power as a safe, advanced source of electricity and a pillar of Soviet prestige. Just months before the catastrophe, a Ukrainian minister estimated the chance of a meltdown to be once every 10,000 years.

Then on the night of April 26, a late-night safety test at Chernobyl went terribly wrong, resulting in two explosions that blew apart the reactor's core and set off a radioactive blaze that burned for days. The blast released as much radiation as 500 Hiroshima bombs, contaminating tens of thousands of square miles and exposing millions of people. About 3 million of those victims were children.

Read: What were the Russians doing in Chornobyl?

The U.S.S.R. hailed children as the “only privileged class.” They smiled happily from television screens and propaganda posters—symbols of a bright Communist future—and were promised carefree childhoods. Yet, as Arndt shows, they fared poorly after the accident. Pripyat, an atomgrad (or “nuclear town,”) built to serve the Chernobyl plant, went about its normal business for hours after the explosion; children were pushed in strollers by unsuspecting parents and played soccer in already contaminated streets. Although officials were at the plant the next morning, taking stock of the situation, the evacuation of Pripyat's population did not begin until a day and a half later.

That initial delay, which resulted from confusion about the scale of the incident and the authorities' decision to downplay it—ostensibly to avoid panic—was only the first in a chain of fatal mishandlings. With radiation readings so high they had triggered alarms in countries as far away as Sweden, mandatory May Day demonstrations across the U.S.S.R., including in contaminated areas, went on as planned. Children were sent to wave balloons and flags in air thick with radioactive dust.

For thousands of kids, those early days of inadequate response would lead to what Arndt calls “living in prognosis”: a childhood defined by constant medical testing and a lingering fear that sickness could surface at any time. Many of their fates came down to the decisions of local officials in the days after the incident. In Kyiv, for instance, schools closed weeks before the normal end of the school year. Valentyna Shevchenko, then chairwoman of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet, made a unilateral decision to evacuate 700,000 people, breaking with the party recommendations—and likely saving many lives.

Beyond evacuations, the Soviet state had little to offer. To save face, authorities initially rejected help from the United States and Western Europe. Instead, Arndt writes, school-age children from the immediate vicinity were separated from their parents and shipped to summer pioneer camps—state-run recreational facilities meant to instill patriotism—for what officials called “the betterment of health.” Mothers of young children, like Katya's, were eligible to receive vouchers for month-long stays at sanatoria and tourist bases across the U.S.S.R. (Fathers were not considered.)

These arrangements barely lasted through the summer. Only a handful of flagship pioneer camps were open year-round; many children had to return to areas that had been superficially decontaminated. There, each child would receive an extra pair of indoor shoes, to prevent them bringing radioactive matter into the classrooms, along with a largely useless warning to avoid local food and drink. Many lived in homes without electric stoves, leaving them to burn contaminated wood.

Arndt documents how, in the years following the accident, medical commissions collected data on the effects of radiation but offered almost no treatment or guidance. Meanwhile, the incidence of thyroid and blood cancers among children rose—in one hospital in Minsk, the number of leukemia patients almost doubled from 1986 to 1990. In another town in Russia, Arndt writes, doctors and nurses felt that the children they were caring for were “exploited and abandoned.” According to a letter they sent to Mikhail Gorbachev, “every second child suffering from dizziness, stomach, joint and bone pain”—symptoms officials refused to link to radiation exposure. Having rejected help from its Cold War adversaries, the party left children at the mercy of a health-care system crippled by shortages of specialists, modern equipment, and effective drugs.

When radiation-contamination maps were made public in the winter of 1989, the disintegrating Soviet regime belatedly created the State Chernobyl Children Program, which aspired to tackle the “unwelcome effects of Chernobyl” by funding the construction of recovery centers, buying medical equipment, and conducting radiation research. But by then, many children had already gotten sick. Some would not live to see adulthood.

In Belarus, where roughly 70 percent of the radioactive fallout settled, Arndt credits successful aid efforts to activists and parents who mobilized to protect their children. Groups such as the Belarusian nongovernmental organization For the Children of Chernobyl, founded in 1990, drew global attention. Appalled by what they saw in private visits and on TV, European and American charities, philanthropists, doctors, and religious organizations sent large amounts of humanitarian supplies beginning in the early '90s. They also funded trips for children to recover in hospitals, camps, and private homes abroad.

Arndt shows that this act of global empathy was rooted in something deeper than pity for a former enemy: an understanding of humanity's shared peril. Chernobyl's children became emblems of a borderless world—and a future in which disasters aren't confined to a single place. We now seem to fully inhabit that era, one defined by pandemics such as the coronavirus, climate disasters, and new technologies whose promises carry their own dangers. These crises may arise in one country or another, but in many cases, their consequences are global, and they cannot be solved by any single group or government alone.

The stories of individual children give Arndt's account its poignancy. She writes about 7-year-old Vova Malofienko, who was flown by an American aid organization from a Kyiv cancer hospital to a Connecticut camp for seriously ill children. Tatsiana Khvitsko, born without lower legs, was rescued from a Belarusian home for disabled people by an American charity and fitted with prosthetics; she ran her first marathon in 2018. Some children who went abroad for treatment never returned. One girl's refusal to go back to her grandmother's crumbling house after living in a homestay in California even prompted Alexander Lukashenko, Belarus's authoritarian president, to suspend programs that sent sick children to the U.S. for recuperation. After a brief post-Soviet respite, nationalist face-saving was again putting children in harm's way.

Chernobyl Children is not just a story of ruined childhoods; it is also a portrait of life in the Anthropocene. Arndt's book shows how present the disaster remains, even almost 40 years later. Nearly 5 million people still live on contaminated land, where the radioactive earth is a part of daily existence. Alena Oginets, whose story bookends Arndt's account, was 12 at the time of the explosion; she evacuated and grew up elsewhere. The daughter of a Chernobyl plant worker who died at 50, she remembers Pripyat as a vibrant, modern town surrounded by picturesque marshes and forests. When she returned two decades later, all that remained in her looted apartment was a bathtub that couldn't fit through the door. The forest of her childhood is now roamed by wild boars. Pripyat will remain uninhabitable for centuries, as will the rest of Chernobyl's 30-kilometer exclusion zone.

Read: A vision of Russia as a country that runs on violence

In 2022, a drone captured images of Russian troops in a Chernobyl forest, whose pines were still orange-red from the blast. The first footage of the invasion itself came from a Chernobyl tour company's checkpoint camera, which happened to record the advancing columns. Just as in 1986, tragedy came to Ukraine from a regime consumed by the country's greatness.

Arndt's book isn't without shortcomings: Its narrative is dry and confined primarily to Belarus, where she worked in the '90s. It also stops short of asking why, given the scale of suffering, there has been hardly any attempt at real redress through lawsuits or settlements. Yet Chernobyl Children is an astute and thought-provoking work, connecting the unfinished past to a present and future in which disasters travel faster and wider. It shows the pitfalls of blind faith in technological progress—and the human cost of a quest for dominance devoid of responsibility.

Federal charges against two players for pitch fixing are a warning about the league's embrace of gambling.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Gambling is a numbers game, so here are a few: The pitcher Emmanuel Clase's 2025 salary from Major League Baseball's Cleveland Guardians is $4.5 million dollars. This weekend, prosecutors unveiled charges that he had made just $12,000 from two recent rigged pitches. And he could face as many as 65 years in prison (though such a stiff sentence seems unlikely).

Clase and the fellow Guardians hurler Luis Ortiz were indicted last week for their involvement in the scheme, which allegedly netted bettors hundreds of thousands of dollars. (Attorneys for Clase and Ortiz have denied the allegations.) The scheme outlined in the indictment is the latest instance of legalized gambling's corrosive influence on professional sports. Major leagues have welcomed the industry with open arms and greedy palms, signing contracts with betting companies and bringing casinos into stadiums and arenas, but they act astonished when gambling starts to corrupt their own players.

Traditional sports fandom involves rooting for your team to win; traditional sports gambling involves putting money on the game results too. The most notorious baseball-gambling episode was the 1919 “Black Sox” scandal, in which members of the Chicago White Sox (including “Shoeless Joe” Jackson) were accused of intentionally losing the World Series as part of a mob betting scheme and banned from the sport.

The indictment against Clase and Ortiz alleges something that is both less directly threatening to the game's integrity and somehow even bleaker. Nothing in the charges suggests that Clase, a fearsome closer and three-time All-Star, intentionally lost any games. Instead, prosecutors say, he and Ortiz agreed to throw balls on particular pitches. The gamblers then placed prop bets—wagers on specific outcomes—and won money. In other words, this was gambling for gambling's sake, staking money on things that no one would care about for any independent reason, and then concocting elaborate methods of cheating to make those things happen.

For decades after the Black Sox scandal, MLB rigorously pushed gambling away. Pete Rose, the sport's all-time-hits leader, was permanently banned when he was revealed to have placed bets on baseball, though he claimed this didn't taint the game, because he bet only on his teams to win. (Rose's ban was repealed earlier this year, after his death, following pressure from President Donald Trump, a longtime casino owner.)

Since a 2018 Supreme Court ruling effectively legalized it, betting has been available widely and has shed much of its stigma. Individual problem gamblers are suffering, and Clase and Ortiz seem likely to pay for their involvement if found guilty. Yet the big corporations of the sports world are doubling down on gambling. Last week, ESPN announced that it was ending ESPN Bet, a gambling foray with Penn Entertainment that failed to capture many users. But the network isn't abandoning its hopes: It's signing a new deal with DraftKings, one of the two biggest industry players.

The big sports leagues are way out ahead. Hard figures on how much revenue their involvement with betting has brought them aren't available, but it's safe to say the numbers are large. A 2018 projection from an industry group suggested MLB would make $1.1 billion and the NFL would make $2.3 billion annually. And if those estimates aren't exactly impartial, anyone who's watched a game, looked at the ESPN app, or driven past innumerable billboards for DraftKings and FanDuel can surmise that a lot of cash is washing around—whether from direct agreements or indirect effects such as ad spending and more attention.

The answer from the leagues has been to try to cut back on prop bets. Keith O'Brien argued in The Atlantic last month—after another depressing gambling scandal, this time in the NBA—that “prop bets pose a particular threat to the integrity of the game.” Any individual athlete has only so much control over whether his or her team wins or loses. But prop bets focus on smaller outcomes over which one player can have a great deal of influence, such as their point total (in basketball) and yardage (in football). As a result, players are particularly susceptible to manipulation, and that in turn corrupts their sport as a whole. After the Clase and Ortiz indictment, MLB said that its partners would limit bets on specific pitches, and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver earlier asked platforms to “pull back some of the prop bets.”

That seems better than nothing, but barely. As Charles Fain Lehman wrote in The Atlantic last fall, the problem is not particular kinds of sports gambling—it's sports gambling more broadly. “The rise of sports gambling has caused a wave of financial and familial misery, one that falls disproportionately on the most economically precarious households,” he argued, citing research that has found that less saving, more bank overdrafts, and greater rates of bankruptcy are associated with looser gambling laws. These problems are particularly common among young men, who are becoming dangerously addicted, as my colleague Hana Kiros has reported.

Young men also, of course, make up the rosters of MLB, the NFL, and the NBA. No one should be naive about how money suffuses professional sports—the leagues exist to turn a profit—but it's easy to see why putting intensely competitive men in situations where gambling is celebrated and advertised is going to create temptations they can't all resist, even if the payoff likely amounts to a rounding error on their paychecks, as in the Clase and Ortiz indictment.

Prohibition has a bad reputation, and American society seems to be turning against regulating vices. I tend to agree that banning everything that is socially undesirable just creates opportunities for overweening enforcement, but gambling still brings out my most puritanical impulses. (You can make a good policy case against banning betting and other vices while still disapproving of them; a principled libertarianism need not be libertine.) Before the 2018 Supreme Court ruling, though, betting wasn't completely banned. In addition to friendly leagues among friends, gambling was legal in a few select places: Las Vegas, Atlantic City, certain Native American lands. That provided enough of an outlet for people to be able to indulge in gambling from time to time yet ensured that it was viewed as an irregular indulgence, faintly improper.

The past month has seen the best of baseball, in the epochal World Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Toronto Blue Jays, and some of the worst, in this indictment. MLB should think hard about the lessons of the latter. Sports leagues think that they're in on the deal, but they're really the mark, falling for the same trap that every gambler does. They see money on the table and can't resist trying for it, forgetting that the house always comes out ahead.

What a Cranky New Book About Progress Gets Right

By Tyler Austin Harper

During the five years I worked as an environmental-studies professor at a progressive private college, I undertook a small, semesterly rebellion: I had students read “Confessions of a Recovering Environmentalist,” a 2011 essay by the British writer and former green radical Paul Kingsnorth. In it, Kingsnorth chronicles his disenchantment with the activism that had once been his life's work—the very kind of advocacy that had driven many of my students, that had driven me, into that classroom in the first place.

The essay makes the case that mainstream environmentalism has abandoned the commitments and ideas that originally defined it.

Back in April, I wrote about what I called the “pardon-to-prison pipeline”: the string of people who reoffend after receiving clemency from Trump. Yesterday I saw two relevant updates: First, John Banuelos, who allegedly fired a gun into the air during the January 6, 2021, insurrection, was arrested last month in Utah on charges of sexual assault and kidnapping. And in New York, Jonathan Braun, whom I mentioned in April, was sentenced to more than two years in federal prison after his conviction on charges including assault and sexual abuse. “He is at least the eighth convict to whom Mr. Trump granted clemency during his first term who has since been charged with a crime,” The New York Times noted. Also on Monday, the White House announced that Trump had pardoned 77 people accused of involvement in his attempt to overturn the 2020 election. I'm not a betting man, as you may have guessed, but if I were, I wouldn't stake much on that group staying out of trouble with the law.

Guillermo del Toro's new adaptation is a feat of design but not of story.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Guillermo del Toro has spent his filmmaking career finding sympathy for monsters. His best-known stories balance compassion and edge. He won the Oscar for Best Picture for The Shape of Water, an aching if gory ballad of an aquatic creature falling in love with a human; his superhero movies focus on fringe characters such as Blade (half-man, half-vampire) and the demonic Hellboy, both outcasts operating in society's shadows. It's hardly a surprise, then, that he's been trying to get an adaptation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein off the ground for many years. The final result of that endeavor, now on Netflix, is a handsome, burnished production with gorgeous sets, colorful costumes, and the deep well of compassion that runs through all of del Toro's work. So why does it feel so inert?

The answer may lie with del Toro himself. The director, it seems, is prone to becoming almost too enamored of his source material. Frankenstein is del Toro's third take in a row on a classic novel, after his remake of Nightmare Alley and his Oscar-winning, stop-motion version of Pinocchio. I walked out of each dazzled by the design elements; in a cinematic era reliant on CGI-rendered locations and cheap technological embellishment, the director has a distinct commitment to practical effects. He refuses to skimp on the creativity of his art direction, no matter the scale of the project. For Frankenstein, Netflix handed him a massive budget to play with, and the money is all up on the big screen, if you can catch the movie on one. But just like del Toro's previous reverent adaptations, all of that sumptuousness is hamstrung by his apparent desire to remain faithful to the original tale.

Read: Why Guillermo del Toro made Frankenstein

The film begins, as Shelley's novel does, on a giant ship that's trapped in the Arctic ice—one that is clearly a physical, colossal prop. When the hulking Creature (played by Jacob Elordi) shows up and starts throwing sailors around, the stunt work is stunningly tactile. Del Toro captures the action beautifully and always knows where to throw in a surprising spine crunch to prove to his audience that he's not serving up a staid period piece. Despite the on-screen spectacle, however, I was soon fidgeting in my seat, waiting for the story's pathos to catch up. Yet the cast members are never able to match the grandiosity of del Toro's vision, drowned out by the wonderful sets around them.

Oscar Isaac plays Baron Victor Frankenstein—the man responsible for animating del Toro's latest lovable monster—with as much Gothic panache as he can summon. His hair is lustrous and flowy, his brow eternally furrowed; he spits out every vaguely European-accented line, emphasizing the scientist's arrogance. As the Creature, Elordi is tremendous. He uses his exaggerated physique to communicate otherworldliness, but his gaze is deep and childlike. Because the character can barely speak for most of the movie, Elordi's eyes have to do the talking, and they do an impressive job of it. Watching him, I began to long for a simpler, leaner adaptation that truly puts Frankenstein's monster front and center. Del Toro, like Shelley, changes up the protagonists; the film focuses on Frankenstein before switching in the second half to the Creature's point of view. Although that shift works in the book—an epistolary novel written in the first person—here, it means there's less time to develop either character's perspective.

The audience likely already knows that Frankenstein's controversial science experiment is doomed to fail: The Creature will come to life and then turn against his cruel master, seeking freedom and, eventually, revenge. Del Toro and Isaac can't quite explain why Frankenstein becomes such a base villain, locking his life's work in a dungeon and treating him like an animal. The viewer gets a taste of backstory in flashbacks to the doctor's unforgiving father (Charles Dance) and the tragic death of his young mother (Mia Goth), but these scenes unfurl like stylish window dressing atop the foreboding world del Toro constructs. Frankenstein simply can't understand his creation's humanity—that's the folly driving this narrative, no matter how slowly.

I was frustrated by del Toro's inventiveness being largely limited to the film's look. The director's dedication to honoring Shelley's writing, paired with Netflix's huge investment, doesn't allow for any additional experimentation. What could have been the kind of bittersweet monster movie del Toro has excelled at instead feels shackled by its opulence, trudging through a two-and-a-half-hour run time to arrive at its expected conclusion. His efforts to wash his movies in splendor are beautiful—even novel—but these innovations cannot always outweigh familiarities. Sometimes, they make them even more glaringly apparent.

﻿Everyone can benefit from an overnight hang with their pals.

It had been a long week, and Tonna Obaze really wanted to hang out with her friend Bria. But she also didn't want to get off the couch. A logical solution emerged: a sleepover.

They both worked late that Friday night — Obaze, 28, is the founder of a consulting firm — and Bria arrived in sweats once she finished up. They raided Obaze's fridge, ordered takeout, and queued up a movie, but they barely made it past the opening credits before launching into a freewheeling conversation covering everything from family to therapy to dating. Eventually, they fell asleep on the couch, side by side. Though the friends both live in New York City, they yearned for more distraction-free time together than a 90-minute dinner reservation afforded.

“There were even a couple tears shed where we, as people in our late 20s, our early 30s, have just been yearning to get back to this friendship where you can sit on the couch and eat whatever's in the fridge, watch a movie, and just catch up with each other with no ending or timing in sight,” Obaze says.

The humble sleepover is a youthful rite of passage that gradually becomes less thrilling as you age. Once a place for snacks, movies, and staying up way past bedtime, the allure begins to fade as teens gain more independence. Who needs to hole up in a friend's basement when more exciting activities await? For many who partake in the traditional American college experience, those four years can be seen as one giant sleepover, consisting of romantic and platonic sojourns alike. Then, where, and with whom, you sleep becomes more about function than fun: Shacking up with roommates, romantic partners, and family is a matter of convenience and obligation.

But as the constraints and responsibilities of adulthood mount, and spending time with friends falls lower on the priority list, there's a case to be made for the sleepover — a purely platonic hangout among friends who simply want to see more of each other. Not to be confused with those of the sexual kind, the platonic adult sleepover ones are particularly attractive to young-ish women without children who crave deeper connection with their friends (and have the time and resources to do so). Men, on the other hand, who tend to bond over activities rather than emotions, may find purposefully inviting a friend to spend the night awkward and juvenile. But they could stand to benefit from something as seemingly silly as a sleepover. And they sometimes do, in the case of camping, multiday conventions, and other activity-based overnight excursions.

An extended, concentrated hangout is a far better use of your free time than the occasional happy hour. 

Dedicating several hours to a pal in as intimate a location as possible sets the scene for more vulnerable conversations. Even if the itinerary for the evening falls on the banal side — eating, watching TV, sleeping — simply living alongside another person can bring you closer.

A common refrain among many adults is the relative difficulty in making and maintaining friends in adulthood — how the whole ordeal was easier, more straightforward in childhood. A lot of that ease boils down to the amount of time children spend with their peers in school and extracurricular activities. See someone frequently enough and you move through the strangers-to-friend pipeline fairly quickly.

Baked into this adolescent friend-making process is hanging out beyond school walls. Playdates, sports, and, yes, sleepovers, become the canvas for which kids and adolescents forge deeper connections, to goof around in relative privacy, to see how other families live. Adult sleepovers serve many of these same functions in an open-ended format.

And if time is what adults lack in their friendships (which research says they do), sleepovers provide plenty of it. For obvious reasons, a parent's schedule might not be very amenable to overnight hangouts with friends, but the ritual doesn't need to be exclusive to single women in their 20s. If you're looking to get the most out of what limited time you have, an extended, concentrated hangout is a far better use of your free time than the occasional happy hour you need to schedule four months in advance.

Sleepovers are also great opportunities to get the whole family involved, too: What's stopping you from hosting a backyard campout with a few families in the summertime? Aside from departure in the morning, there are few time constraints, few distractions, few obligations beyond prioritizing your friends — and perhaps acting like a kid again.

At the sleepovers she hosts at her Lakeland, Florida, home, Maegan Thompson, 31, often plays games, sits by the bonfire, and watches TV cuddled up next to ten or so friends (some of whom do have kids at home), much like she did as a child.

“The things that you used to be able to bond with other people over when you were younger,” she says, “are the same things you get to bond over when you become an adult.”

These laid-back activities eliminate the need for pretense, to constantly perform or entertain one another. In a culture where the pressure exists to curate and broadcast life's every moment, letting your guard down and simply coexisting with a friend can unlock new levels of intimacy. “We're just there to be with one another, rather than to be more impression-management concerned,” says Jeffrey Hall, a professor of communication studies at the University of Kansas, “or trying to make a good public appearance when you go out to drinks or to go out to dinner.”

In other words, sleepovers are, in essence, purposeless. They allow friends to be boring together, a much-needed antidote to the pressure to be always-on. And research shows that doing even the most basic of daily activities — like eating, reading, or cleaning — in the presence of another person makes the task more enjoyable. Why not watching TV and sleeping, too? “A sleepover also includes things like hours and hours and hours of time spent late into the night,” Hall says, “really relaxed and embracing all of that enjoyment of friendship without having to have an end [time].”

During her most recent sleepover, Los Angeles-based Deandra Kanu and her long-distance best friend binge-watched TV, lay in bed, and not much else. “I think that it's the ability to just be yourself without entertainment,” the 29-year-old says. “That's what a sleepover is. You guys are the entertainment.”

Nowhere else is this lack of impression management more apparent than in the act of getting ready for bed. You might get a chance to perform your nightly skincare routines in tandem, comment on someone's choice of pajamas, observe how many pillows they need to fall asleep. “You've seen how I do my hair at night,” says Jaimie Arona Krems, an associate professor of psychology and the director of the UCLA Center for Friendship Research, “or you've seen my big, stupid sleep shirt, and we're still friends, and you didn't tell anyone else.”

Feeling safe and comfortable enough to tangibly bare all, sleepover attendees might be more willing to be more emotionally vulnerable, too, according to Krems. Cocooned and protected in your home (or the home of someone you love), you might let your guard down, be more disclosing. To just be.

“The home is an environment where people feel more comfortable. You're allowed to let down your guard a little bit more,” says Obaze, who recently hosted Bria for a sleepover. “When you give people that ability to make themselves at home, and you're open, they're also open, and you can just do so much more.”

The Supreme Court may soon upend President Donald Trump's trade war.

Various state governments and small businesses are challenging the legality of most of Trump's tariffs. Their case reached the Supreme Court a week ago. In oral arguments, a majority of justices appeared to side with the plaintiffs — and it isn't hard to see why they might have such sympathies.

To justify the bulk of his tariffs, Trump has invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a statute that empowers the president to “regulate” transactions in response to “unusual and extraordinary” threats amid national emergencies. In the administration's view, this law authorizes them to impose tariffs on more or less any nation, since America's trade deficit constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States.

But the idea that a trade deficit constitutes such a calamity is disputed by most economists and legal scholars. And it's not clear that the IEEPA authorizes broad tariffs in any case: “Regulating” a transaction is not necessarily the same thing as imposing a tax on imports. And it's not clear that Congress can constitutionally give presidents completely open-ended authority to impose new tariffs, given that the legislative branch is supposed to hold the power of the purse.

If the Court overturns Trump's tariffs, the economic consequences for ordinary Americans could be profound — at least, until he finds new legal rationales for deliberately driving up the cost of living.

Since taking office, Trump has massively increased taxes on imports. In January, the average US tariff was 2.5 percent. Now, it is 17.9 percent — the highest since 1934 — according to the Budget Lab at Yale.

This has taken a toll on the US economy. By taxing various foreign-made industrial inputs — from steel to semiconductors to lumber — Trump has made it more expensive for American companies to produce things. And by taxing imported goods, he's driven up retail prices. As a result, he has made America's industries less productive and its households less wealthy than they otherwise would have been.

According to a recent analysis from the Budget Lab, Trump's tariffs are poised to slow economic growth by 0.5 percentage points in 2025 and 2026. If maintained indefinitely, his trade regime will leave the American economy persistently 0.35 percent smaller, effectively shedding $105 billion off our national wealth, year after year.

The tariffs are also likely to raise America's price level by about 1.3 percent in the short run. This would effectively cost the average household $1,800 in annual income, due to higher expenses. Making matters worse, by depressing consumption and investment, the tariffs are set to marginally increase unemployment. In the Budget Lab's model, joblessness rises by 0.3 percentage points by the end of this year and 0.7 points by the end of next year.

If the Supreme Court invalidated all of the tariffs that Trump imposed under IEEPA authority, most of these harms would disappear.

The president has enacted tariffs using a variety of distinct powers. An unfavorable Supreme Court ruling would therefore leave some of his trade regime intact. But it would still push America's average tariff rate down to 9.1 percent. According to the Budget Lab, that would translate into:

The only major benefit of the tariffs has been their impact on federal deficits. Trump's trade agenda is poised to raise about $2.2 trillion in revenue over the coming decade. The repeal of the tariffs would cut that by more than half.

Nonetheless, taken together, the overturning of the tariffs would provide a significant economic stimulus — increasing the average household's real annual income by more than $1,000, accelerating growth, and reducing unemployment.

And all that is before accounting for the impact of tariff reimbursement payments: When the government levies an illegal tax, it isn't allowed to retain that revenue. Rather, every importer that paid a tariff this year would be entitled to a refund — one paid back at a 6 percent annual interest rate, compounded daily. To make full restitution, the government would need to send out more than $100 billion to US businesses.

The stimulative impact of those reimbursements would likely be modest. The government wouldn't immediately mail out $100 billion in checks. Rather, every affected importer would need to individually apply for relief, a process that could take years. Nevertheless, reimbursements would boost business revenue — and thus potentially, investment — at the margin.

Of course, stimulating the economy can entail costs. Typically, slashing taxes and increasing deficits nudges up inflation: When you put more cash in people's pockets, they can bid up the prices of goods and services to a higher level.

But since Trump's tariffs directly increase the cost of both consumer goods and industrial inputs, lifting them would likely spark growth and dampen inflation simultaneously. Ending the trade war would therefore be a win-win. Unfortunately, it is a “win” that Trump will likely do everything in his power to avoid.

Trump enacted most of his tariffs using the IEEPA for a reason: Since that statute is meant to facilitate swift presidential action during an emergency, it doesn't require the administration to complete any onerous bureaucratic process before imposing import taxes. By contrast, the White House cannot invoke many other tariff powers without conducting investigations and/or hearings.

Nevertheless, those other powers are considerable. The Trade Act of 1974 authorizes the president to enact duties of unlimited scale on foreign countries that engage in unfair trade practices. Trump is already using this law to place tariffs on Chinese goods.

Separately, that law authorizes the president to impose across-the-board tariffs of up to 15 percent for 150 days, in response to a large trade deficit.

The Trade Expansion Act of 1962, meanwhile, allows the administration to impose tariffs when imports threaten America's national security. Trump has already interpreted this authority expansively: In the administration's account, cheap foreign-made cabinets are a threat to the US homeland.

Taken together, these laws — along with a handful of others — could allow Trump to reimpose virtually all of his tariffs. But the process of rebuilding his trade regime could be lengthy and cumbersome.

To enact tariffs in response to unfair trade practices, the United States Trade Representative must conduct an investigation demonstrating such cheating, a process that can take months. Likewise, to impose duties in the name of national security, the Commerce Department must document the supposed threats in question.

This said, in the wake of an unfavorable Supreme Court ruling, the administration could immediately enact temporary, 15 percent tariffs on any country it wishes. That would buy it 150 days to conduct sham investigations authorizing permanent tariffs through other authorities.

To be sure, it is possible that this would lead to new legal challenges. And the Supreme Court could theoretically rule that every law delegating sweeping tariff powers to the executive branch is unconstitutional. But legal scholars generally believe that Trump's use of the IEEPA has been drastically more legally dubious than his invocation of other trade authorities.

Thus, if the Supreme Court rules against Trump in the IEEPA case, tariffs would likely decline slightly in the short-term. But in the longer run, they could eventually creep back up to something approaching their current level — thereby raising prices, slowing growth, and reducing employment, relative to a world without Trump's tariffs.

All this said, the Trump administration has strong political incentives to pare back its trade war. Americans' top concern is the cost of living. And they overwhelmingly disapprove of Trump's handling of both trade and inflation.

Trump may have dismissed such polling as “fake news.” But he seems to have been rattled by the GOP's dismal showing in the 2025 elections. The morning after Democrats stomped to victory in Virginia, New Jersey, Georgia and other states, Trump declared on Truth Social, “Costs are coming way down. Affordability is our goal.”

In this context, the White House might see an adverse Supreme Court ruling as an opportunity to reset its trade policy — without needing to explicitly admit error. By claiming that his hands have been tied by a corrupt judiciary, Trump could seek to replace some, but not all, of his tariffs without losing face.

If Trump wants to make America poorer in service of his economically illiterate trade ideas, however, the Supreme Court probably won't stop him. Rather, it will just force Trump to pursue such self-sabotage in a more laborious and bureaucratic manner.

Business Insider Edition 

Chinese automakers are stepping up investment in South Africa, with two leading Chinese carmakers, Beijing Automotive Group (BAIC) and Chery, set to build factories and expand local manufacturing.


Chinese automakers are stepping up investment in South Africa, with Beijing Automotive Group (BAIC) and Chery unveiling plans to expand local manufacturing; a move that underscores Africa's growing role in the global auto industry.
    


        With intense competition in their home market and increasing trade restrictions in Europe and the United States, Chinese carmakers are turning to Africa as a key growth market. 



        South Africa, with its well-established automotive infrastructure and rising consumer demand, has emerged as a prime destination for these strategic investments.
    


        BAIC, alongside BYD and Chery, is among roughly 18 Chinese brands now active in South Africa. The company's Gqeberha plant in the Eastern Cape currently assembles the BAIC B40 Plus and Beijing X55 Plus SUV models.
    


        BAIC South Africa plans to begin assembling its newly launched B30 off-road SUV at the same facility as early as January, according to Chief Financial Officer Anele Geza. 
    


        The move marks a major step toward boosting local production and integrating more deeply into South Africa's manufacturing base.
    


        Speaking at the B30 launch event, Geza said the new B30 combustion engine and hybrid models will be assembled locally using a completely knocked-down (CKD) process, which involves building cars from numerous smaller parts to increase local content.
    


        The company's current models are made using a semi-knocked-down approach, where large, partially assembled components are imported and completed locally.
    


        The expansion aligns with South Africa's Automotive Masterplan 2035, which aims to raise annual vehicle production from about 600,000 to 1.4 million units and boost local content. 
    


Global automakers such as Toyota and Ford, which already operate factories in South Africa, have urged new entrants to commit to local manufacturing to strengthen the industry's long-term viability.
    


        BAIC South Africa CEO Yang Yixin reaffirmed the company's long-term commitment to the country. He said, 
    


        “We will continue to introduce more new models while steadily expanding local production and value creation.”
    


        Meanwhile, another Chinese car giant, Chery, which owns the Omoda and Jaecoo sister brands, is exploring plans to establish a vehicle assembly plant in South Africa, a potential investment that could create jobs and give a major boost to the country's automotive sector.
    


        The company confirmed it is conducting feasibility studies on local production as it seeks to strengthen its presence in a market that has quickly warmed to Chinese vehicles.
    


        “We're currently conducting feasibility studies in South Africa, which remains a key focus for both Omoda and Jaecoo,” the company said. “The country plays an important role in our broader global strategy, and we're carefully assessing opportunities to expand our presence and meet the growing local demand.”
    


        Globally, Chinese automakers have been expanding their manufacturing footprints to diversify production and hedge against trade barriers. Chery said it also plans to bring some of its Chinese suppliers into South Africa to help meet local content requirements.
    


        “We are interested in the long-term investment in South Africa,” the company said.

Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman's expectations for how his employees work at the office are uniquely strict within the company.

Suleyman requires employees to work from the office more than is standard at the company and generally prefers to have open floor plans, a polarizing concept at Microsoft and in engineering in general.

""I very much believe in the in-person working culture,"" Suleyman told Business Insider. ""We've been defragmenting our culture and trying to concentrate.""

Microsoft recently announced a new return-to-office mandate requiring most employees to work in an office at least three days a week, starting January 26.

In contrast, Suleyman requires at least four-days-a-week for his employees who live near an office, according to an internal document viewed by Business Insider. Any exceptions must be approved by an executive who reports to Suleyman directly.

Suleyman told Business Insider that he's not a fan of traditional offices with doors that employees can keep closed. In one of his office setups, he has ""neighborhoods"" with 20 to 30 open desks placed relatively close together, he said.

""Much better for collaboration,"" Suleyman said. ""Everyone can see everyone else who's in. You can feel the buzz, like there's a real intensity about the place, and it just creates a lot more, like informal collaboration. It's so much better.""

The AI executive also has a penchant for hanging in Silicon Valley. Suleyman splits his time between Silicon Valley and Seattle, but said most of his team is in Silicon Valley versus Microsoft's Redmond headquarters.

""There's just huge talent density here,"" he added. ""It's the place to be.""

Microsoft leaves RTO and office-layout decisions up to individual organizations or teams. The company's Corporate, External, and Legal Affairs team, for example, has been working at least four days a week from the office for about a year.

Other teams working on AI have less strict guidelines. Executive Scott Guthrie's Cloud + AI organization has no org-specific return-to-office guidelines or considerations. Jay Parikh's Core AI group will apply the three-day-a-week guidance for all offices in February, with the exception of GitHub, according to the documents reviewed by Business Insider.

Israel-Iran War:

IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi

United Nations nuclear inspectors said they are seriously concerned about the status of Iran's inventory of near-bomb-grade uranium, as the Islamic Republic continues to deny them access to sites bombed several months ago by the US and Israel.

The International Atomic Energy Agency reiterated it hasn't been able to verify Iran's fuel stockpile since mid-June, according to documents seen by Bloomberg. It's the first IAEA report since the UN security council reimposed sanctions that demand Iran suspend enrichment activities.

Notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein wrote in an email to author Michael Wolff that his former longtime friend, President Donald Trump, ""knew about the girls,"" according to a copy of that April 2019 message purportedly between the two men released by House Democrats on Wednesday.

It is unclear what the phrase ""knew about the girls"" meant.

In another newly released email that Epstein wrote to his now-convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell in April 2011, Epstein wrote, ""I want you to realize that the dog that hasn't barked is trump.""

Epstein added in that same email that a person whom the Democrats identified as a victim of his, whose name was redacted in the email, ""spent hours at my house with"" Trump.

""He has never once been mentioned,"" Epstein added in that message.

Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, in a statement, said that they had obtained the emails and more than 20,000 other documents from the estate of Epstein.

The release came two days after Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee said in a statement, ""Whistleblower information provided to the Committee also indicates that Ghislaine Maxwell is working on filing a 'Commutation Application' with the Trump Administration."" 

Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for crimes related to procuring underage girls to be abused by Epstein.

Trump has denied that he knew about Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls and women. The president has never been charged with wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.

It is not clear what Epstein was referring to in the email that said ""the dog that hasn't barked.""

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a statement on Wednesday, said, ""The Democrats selectively leaked emails to the liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.""

""The 'unnamed victim' referenced in these emails is the late Virginia Giuffre, who repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and 'couldn't have been friendlier' to her in their limited interactions,"" Leavitt said.

""The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,"" Leavitt said.

""These stories are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to distract from President Trump's historic accomplishments, and any American with common sense sees right through this hoax and clear distraction from the government opening back up again.""

Giuffre died by suicide in April.

CNBC has requested comment from Maxwell's attorney about the emails.

Epstein, 66, killed himself in a Manhattan jail in August 2019, weeks after he was arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.

Scores of women have said Epstein sexually abused them when they were underage girls or young women.

Democrats on the House Oversight Committee said the emails that they obtained raise ""serious questions"" about Trump's involvement with Epstein.

The three emails related to Trump are among thousands written by Epstein and obtained by the Democrats.

""The more Donald Trump tries to cover up the Epstein files, the more we uncover. These latest emails and correspondence raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the President,"" said Rep. Robert Garcia, a California Democrat who is the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee.

""The Department of Justice must fully release the Epstein files to the public immediately,"" Garcia said. ""The Oversight Committee will continue pushing for answers and will not stop until we get justice for the victims.""

 Trump and the DOJ have been criticized for months for reneging on promises by Trump administration officials to release criminal investigative files about Epstein.

Trump said in July that he threw Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and cut ties with him years ago because ""he stole people who worked for me.""

Trump said that Epstein had poached at least one more Mar-a-Lago worker from him after being warned not to do that again.

The president has repeatedly called demands that officials release the so-called Epstein files ""a Democratic hoax.""

Anthropic announced plans Wednesday to spend $50 billion on a U.S. artificial intelligence infrastructure build-out, starting with custom data centers in Texas and New York.

The facilities, which will be designed to support the company's rapid enterprise growth and its long-term research agenda, will be developed in partnership with Fluidstack.

Fluidstack is an AI cloud platform that supplies large-scale graphics processing unit, or GPU, clusters to clients like Meta, Midjourney and Mistral.

Additional sites are expected to follow, with the first locations going live in 2026. The project is expected to create 800 permanent jobs and more than 2,000 construction roles.

The investment positions Anthropic as a major domestic player in physical AI infrastructure at a moment when policymakers are increasingly focused on U.S.-based compute capacity and technological sovereignty.

""We're getting closer to AI that can accelerate scientific discovery and help solve complex problems in ways that weren't possible before. Realizing that potential requires infrastructure that can support continued development at the frontier,"" said CEO Dario Amodei. ""These sites will help us build more capable AI systems that can drive those breakthroughs, while creating American jobs.""

The move comes as Anthropic rival OpenAI pushes forward with an aggressive build-out of its own. The ChatGPT maker has secured more than $1.4 trillion in long-term infrastructure commitments through deals with Nvidia, Broadcom, Oracle and the major cloud providers, including Microsoft, Google, and, most recently, Amazon.

The scale of that spending has raised questions about whether the U.S. has the power capacity and industrial backbone to deliver on such promises, and whether the AI sector is drifting into bubble territory.

Anthropic serves more than 300,000 businesses, with enterprise clients driving most of its revenue.

The number of large accounts, which generate more than $100,000 annually, has nearly increased sevenfold in the past year. Internal projections obtained by The Wall Street Journal showed Anthropic expects to break even by 2028, well ahead of OpenAI, which is projecting $74 billion in operating losses that same year.

To support that trajectory, Anthropic tapped Fluidstack to build custom facilities optimized for its AI workloads, citing the firm's speed and ability to deliver gigawatts of power on short timelines.

In parallel, Amazon has opened a dedicated data center campus for Anthropic on 1,200 acres in Indiana.

The $11 billion facility is already up and running, while many competitors are still promising data centers of the future. Anthropic has also expanded its compute deal with Google by tens of billions of dollars.

The move also comes as the role of the federal government in financing AI infrastructure becomes a flashpoint.

Last week, OpenAI asked the Trump administration to expand a key CHIPS Act tax credit to include AI data centers and grid components like transformers, according to a letter obtained by Bloomberg.

That request followed backlash over comments from CFO Sarah Friar, who had floated the idea of a government ""backstop"" for OpenAI's compute deals.

Though the company has since walked back the suggestion of federal guarantees, the episode underscored the political and financial uncertainty surrounding how — and by whom — America's AI infrastructure will be funded.

Coinbase is following Tesla out of Delaware and into Texas.

Paul Grewal, Coinbase's chief legal officer, wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Wednesday that the crypto exchange is moving its state of incorporation, a year after Elon Musk did the same with his electric vehicle maker. Musk also reincorporated his rocket maker SpaceX from Delaware to Texas.

""Delaware's legal framework once provided companies with consistency. But no more,"" Grawal wrote, pointing to recent ""unpredictable outcomes"" in the Delaware Chancery Court.

A handful of notable names, including Dropbox, TripAdvisor and venture firm Andreessen Horowitz have announced departures from Delaware. It's a move that was championed by Musk following a Delaware Chancery Court ruling that ordered Tesla to rescind the CEO's 2018 pay package, worth about $56 billion in options.

""If your company is still incorporated in Delaware, I recommend moving to another state as soon as possible,"" Musk wrote in a post on X in February 2024, when he filed to change SpaceX's incorporation state.

Last week, Tesla shareholders voted to approve Musk's more recent pay package, which could be worth up to $1 trillion.

Delaware has long been the dominant state for U.S. companies to incorporate due to its flexible corporate code and expert judiciary, and is seen as balancing the rights of executives and shareholders. A Texas state law allows corporations to limit shareholder lawsuits against insiders for breach of fiduciary duty. 

Coinbase and Andreessen Horowitz, an early backer, currently face a lawsuit in Delaware concerning the sale of shares in the crypto company tied to its public listing in 2021.

Like Musk, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong was a major contributor to President Donald Trump's 2024 campaign for the White House.

In this article

Waymo robotaxis will now take passengers on freeways in three major U.S. cities, marking a major milestone for the driverless, ride-hailing company.

Alphabet-owned Waymo on Wednesday said it will begin offering those types of trips in the San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles markets ""when a freeway route is meaningfully faster."" The Google sister company will gradually extend freeway trips to more riders and locations over time.

Although Waymo's driverless cars have previously taken passengers on smaller highways and side streets, Wednesday's expansion marks the first time the company will take payment from public riders to go on freeways with higher speed limits.

""Freeway driving is one of those things that's very easy to learn, but very hard to master when we're talking about full autonomy without a human driver as a backup, and at scale,"" Waymo co-CEO Dmitri Dolgov said at a press event ahead of the announcement. ""It took time to do it properly.""

Waymo vehicles will generally travel up to a freeway's maximum posted speed limit, which is 65 mph in many cases, the company said. However, a spokesperson confirmed, the robotaxis may sometimes go a few miles over the limit for safety purposes in extraordinary circumstances.

Freeway operations required expanded operational protocols, including coordination with safety officials at the California Highway Patrol and the Arizona Department of Public Safety, Waymo said. The company also installed additional infrastructure needed to charge its fleet of electric robotaxis given the freeway expansion.

Over the last year, Waymo has offered select Alphabet employees robotaxi freeway rides around San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix in preparation for Wednesday's launch, said Waymo Product Manager Jacopo Sannazzaro.

The company has been testing on freeways for more than a decade in total, he added. Besides testing on public roads and closed courses, Waymo also conducts testing in simulation to determine how its vehicles will respond to both typical and hard-to-replicate events, like merging onto freeways, lane-splitting motorcyclists or another car flipping over.

CNBC took a freeway test ride in a Waymo in the San Francisco Bay Area, from YouTube's offices in San Bruno to San Mateo and back. The ride went on and off ramps along the California 101 seamlessly, with no incidents.

After already launching its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles, Waymo has also announced plans to expand to Miami, San Diego and Washington, D.C., in 2026. The company is also testing its vehicles in New York City, Tokyo and plans to begin offering rides to the public in London next year.

Waymo on Wednesday also announced that it's expanding its service footprint in the San Francisco Bay Area to San Jose. That includes rides to and from San Jose Mineta International Airport, marking the company's second international airport destination. The SJC airport plans were first announced in September.

In 2023, Waymo launched at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, which has become its most popular destination in the Phoenix metropolitan service area.

The company expanded its service in March to include an additional 27 square miles of coverage in the region, including cities like Mountain View and Palo Alto. After the Wednesday expansion, Waymo now offers service in about 260 square miles of Silicon Valley.

Would-be Waymo competitor Tesla also takes passengers to and from SJC. Customers can hail a ride via Tesla's ""Robotaxi"" app, but that name is not precisely descriptive. Tesla only operates a car service with human drivers on board, not a commercial robotaxi service like Waymo's, due to a mix of technical limits and permit requirements in California.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average surged to a new record close yesterday. But the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite sat out of the gains, as key artificial intelligence stocks floundered.

Here's the rundown:

While the government shutdown could be over soon, don't expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics to release all the missed economic data immediately.

As CNBC's Jeff Cox reports, government agencies will need time to catch up on data collection. If the shutdown ends this week, Goldman Sachs estimated that the BLS could have a schedule for when it would release reports — but not the data itself — out early next week.

Market watchers are especially eager to see what job market data will say, as other data sources point to loosening in the labor force. Adding to the uncertainty is the rise of ""ghost job"" postings, a term used to describe listings for open roles that have never appeared to be filled.

President Donald Trump floated a tariff rebate check over the weekend. Experts are warning you shouldn't hold your breath.

Policy analysts and economists told CNBC's Jessica Dickler that Trump's idea of paying Americans a ""dividend"" of at least $2,000 — except for ""high income people"" — likely wouldn't happen anytime soon. They also warned that this type of economic stimulus could drive up inflation.

Speaking of tariffs, CNBC's Lori Ann LaRocco reported that U.S. importers are expecting a simple repayment process if the Supreme Court rules against Trump's levies and forces a refund.

The Senate Agriculture Committee this week released a draft of its part of a market structure bill for digital assets, a major step toward greater investor adoption of cryptocurrencies. 

The draft lays out a framework for how to place guardrails on the industry and institutions that want to utilize digital assets. Cody Carbone, CEO of crypto trade association Digital Chamber, called it ""the most consequential roadmap"" for how institutions will utilize these currencies.

Here are our biggest takeaways from the draft.

On, the Swiss sportswear company, isn't seeing the same slowdown as other shoe makers. The company reported better-than-expected earnings and raised its guidance this morning, saying it wouldn't need to offer Black Friday deals to juice demand. Shares of On surged nearly 9% in premarket trading.

Elsewhere in fitness, Oura CEO Tom Hale told CNBC in an exclusive interview that the smart ring maker could see $2 billion in sales in 2026, almost doubling sales for a second straight year. Oura raised $900 million in a funding round last month, bringing its value to $11 billion. But public market investors shouldn't get too excited: Hale said there's ""no news on an IPO"" for the Finnish company.

In this article

Autonomous EV freight trucking company Einride is planning to go public on the New York Stock Exchange through a SPAC deal with Legato Merger Corp. III, a blank check company, valuing it at $1.8 billion.

The deal is expected to raise $219 million in gross proceeds, with up to an additional $100 million in PIPE capital from institutional investors, with Einride to begin trading during the first half of 2026.

In announcing its plans, the Stockholm, Sweden-based company reported a contracted annual recurring revenue base of $65 million and over $800 million in potential long-term ARR.

Founded in 2016, Einride has over 25 customers across seven countries, and regulatory permits in the United States and Europe. Its current fleet of approximately 200 electric vehicles is used by customers including GE Appliances and Swedish online pharmacy company Apotea.

""Today marks a defining moment for Einride and for the future of freight technology,"" saidRoozbeh Charli, CEO of Einride, in a release. ""We've proven the technology, built trust with global customers, and shown that autonomous and electric operations are not just possible, but better. This transaction positions us to accelerate our global expansion and continue to deliver with speed and precision for our customers,"" said Charli, who took over the CEO post from co-founder and previous CEO Robert Falck last May.

Einride has made the CNBC Disruptor 50 list for three consecutive years, ranking No. 24 in 2025.

Freight trucking in the U.S. and elsewhere, estimated by Einride at a $4.6 trillion market, is both carbon-intensive and inefficient. Einride's technology is designed to reduce emissions at scale and prove electric freight is viable both technologically and economically.

PepsiCo is among the companies that has piloted use of Einride freight solutions, in markets including the U.S., Germany, and Memphis, Tennessee. Heineken added EV freight routes between the Netherlands and Germany in 2024, and to Austria. Einride also has plans to deploy 300 electric trucks across Europe by 2030 with Mars.

To date, Einride provides freight services for both driver-operated electric trucks and heavy-duty autonomous EV trucks. Its technology can be licensed to third parties, both operational planning AI software and its autonomous driving system.

In May of last year, Einride signed a deal with DP World to deploy the largest autonomous EV fleet in the Middle East, at the major UAE port, Jebel Ali, one of the world's largest shipping points.

While many of its deals to date are for EV and not autonomous technology, in the U.S. it marked a year of autonomous operations with GE Appliances in 2024, and began autonomous freight shipments with Swedish online pharmacy company Apotea, Europe's first daily autonomous freight trips.

The U.S. is the company's second-largest market and it plans to continue to invest in the country to accelerate deployment of its autonomous systems. In all, Einride reports over 1,700 driverless hours in contracted customer operations, over 11 million electric miles driven, and over 350,000 executed shipments.

""This transaction with Einride aligns with our vision to bring industry-leading, innovative technology to the public markets,"" said Eric Rosenfeld, chief SPAC officer of Legato, in the release. ""Einride's proven customer relationships, regulatory achievements, and technology platform position the Company to be a leader in the transformation of the freight industry.""

It competes with autonomous trucking companies including Aurora Innovation and fellow Disruptor Waabi, which recently hired Uber Freight CEO and founder Lior Ron as its chief operating officer.

According to data from Matthew Kennedy, senior strategist at Renaissance Capital, a provider of pre-IPO research and IPO-focused ETFs, Legato Merger III raised $175 million in its February 2024 IPO ($201 million including a deal overallotment). The management team's prior two SPACs produced Algoma Steel, a Canada-based steel producer that closed its merger with Legato I in October 2021, and Southland Holdings, an engineering and construction company that completed its merger with Legato II in Feb 2023. Both stocks are currently trading below their $10 transaction price. ""This is not unusual for a de-SPAC, but it does highlight the general risk of holding into the merger that we've seen,"" Kennedy said.

The SPAC market is booming this year, raising nearly 200% more in proceeds than at the same point last year, according to Renaissance Capital data. It is the third-biggest year ever for SPACs, behind 2020 and 2021, measured in deal flow and proceeds, with Kennedy citing an acceleration in retail trading in tech companies, ""which are the wheelhouse of SPAC merger activity,"" he said.

Transportation technology, in particular, has been a focus for SPAC mergers, including autonomous driving and electrification. Kennedy noted SPACs in the space have a mixed track record. Recent winners include electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft company Joby Aviation and EV battery tech company Quantumscape. But there have been a significant number of losers, he added, including EV trucking companies Nikola and Volta, and several EV companies focused on the consumer auto market: Vinfast, Faraday Future, Polestar, Lucid and Canoo. 

There is another trucking-focused SPAC deal underway between Plus.AI and Churchill Capital Corp IX.

In this article

Google filed a lawsuit Wednesday against a foreign cybercriminal group behind a massive SMS phishing, or ""smishing,"" operation.

Dubbed by some cyber researchers as the ""Smishing Triad,"" the organization, which Google said is largely based out of China, uses a phishing-as-a-service kit named ""Lighthouse"" to create and deploy attacks using fraudulent texts.

The crime group has amassed more than a million victims across 120 countries, Google said in a release.

""They were preying on users' trust in reputable brands such as E-ZPass, the U.S. Postal Service, and even us as Google,"" Google general counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado told CNBC. ""The 'Lighthouse' enterprise or software creates a bunch of templates in which you create fake websites to pull users' information.""

Google brought claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO, Act, the Lanham Act, and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or CFAA, and is seeking to dismantle the group and the Lighthouse platform.

The texts usually contain malicious links to a fake website designed to steal victims' sensitive financial information, including Social Security numbers, banking credentials and more.

The messages can often appear in the form of a fake fraud alert, delivery update, unpaid government fee notification, or other seemingly urgent texts.

The crime group has stolen approximately between 12.7 million and 115 million credit cards in the U.S. alone, Google said.

""The idea is to prevent its continued proliferation, deter others from doing something similarly, as well as protect both the users and brands that were misused in these websites from future harm,"" DeLaine Prado said.

The Alphabet-owned company said it has found more than 100 website templates generated by Lighthouse using Google's branding on sign-in screens to trick victims into thinking the sites were legitimate.

Internal and third-party investigations found that around 2,500 members of the syndicate were corresponding on a public Telegram channel to recruit more members, share advice, and test and maintain the Lighthouse software itself, DeLaine Prado said.

She added that the organization also had a ""data broker"" group, which supplied the list of potential victims and contacts, a ""spammer"" group, responsible for the SMS messages, and a ""theft"" group that would coordinate their attacks using the procured credentials on public Telegram channels.

Google said it's the first company to take legal action against SMS phishing scams and is additionally endorsing three bipartisan bills intended to protect against fraud and cyberattacks.

""While the lawsuit is one potential vector in which we can disrupt it, we also think that this type of cyber activity requires a policy-based approach,"" DeLaine Prado said.

The trio of bills includes the Guarding Unprotected Aging Retirees from Deception, or GUARD, Act, the Foreign Robocall Elimination Act, which would establish a task force targeting foreign illegal robocalls, and the Scam Compound Accountability and Mobilization Act, which targets scam compounds and supports survivors of human trafficking within the centers.

The litigation is part of Google's broader strategy to bring cyber protection awareness to users.

The company recently rolled out more safety features, including a Key Verifier tool and artificial intelligence-powered spam detection in Google Messages.

In this article

On raised its full-year guidance for the third quarter in a row on Wednesday after the Swiss sportswear company posted another three months of double-digit growth, bucking a slowdown in the sneaker market. 

The company, known for its innovative approach to running shoes, is now expecting 2025 sales to reach 2.98 billion Swiss francs ($3.72 billion), up from its previous guidance of 2.91 billion francs, on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, the company anticipates sales will grow 34% from the prior year, rising from its previous forecast of 31%. 

The forecast is slightly above the 2.97 billion francs analysts were expecting, according to LSEG. 

""Our focus on premium, on full-price sales, on innovation, on that intersection between performance and design is just resonating very strongly with the consumer, and it's really setting ourselves apart,"" CEO Martin Hoffmann told CNBC in an interview. ""You see it in the results. We have strong top-line growth, we have a strong margin, so that shows that we stay fully committed to full-price sales, and this is across all our channels.""

Shares of On jumped more than 20% in morning trading Wednesday in New York.

During its 2025 third quarter, the sportswear company beat Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines. 

Here's how On performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Sept. 30 was 118.9 million francs, or 36 cents per share, compared with 30.5 million francs, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding one-time items, On posted earnings of 43 cents per share.

Sales rose to 794.4 million francs, up about 25% from roughly 636 million francs a year earlier. 

On's rosy results come as competitors like Nike and Hoka plan for either a sales decline or slowdown in growth, as discretionary spending stagnates and tariffs take a bite out of shoppers' wallets. In late September, Nike said it was expecting sales in its current quarter, which runs generally from early September to early December, to fall by a low single-digit percentage as it works to reignite innovation and streamline operations. Deckers, the parent company behind On's fellow buzzy footwear brand Hoka, trimmed its sales guidance for Hoka in October. 

Meanwhile, On is raising its sales guidance as it gears up for the holiday shopping season. Retail analysts expect most of the industry to lean heavily on discounts and promotions to drum up demand during the critical holiday shopping season, but On won't even be offering a Black Friday discount, said co-founder and Executive co-Chairman Caspar Coppetti.

On will be ""full price through the holiday season,"" Coppetti said in an interview with CNBC. ""This is against the backdrop of a very competitive and very discount-driven environment currently, and so this leveling up that we've done, and then just being able to command a much higher selling price, really sets On apart."" 

While On is typically sold alongside brands like Nike, Hoka and Brooks Running, its holiday strategy is similar to those of luxury names. It's part of the company's strategy to be the most premium sportswear brand on the market by not just offering the highest prices but also the most innovative products across footwear and apparel. 

Still far smaller than many of the legacy brands it competes with, On has slowly been chipping away at their market share primarily through innovation, where industry leader Nike has been criticized for falling behind.

Last year, On launched its Cloudboom Strike LS produced with its ""LightSpray"" technology, which makes performance running shoes using a spray gun in a matter of minutes. Runner Hellen Obiri was wearing the shoes when she broke the women's record in the New York City Marathon by almost three minutes earlier this month.

""That's a very strong validation,"" said Coppetti. ""Runners really do pay attention to what people are wearing now when they're in a race, because these innovations trickle down and they inform their choices.""

Two European pioneers of the modern wind power industry are sounding the alarm on the Trump administration's clean energy cutbacks, warning Washington's anti-climate agenda is part of a broader energy transition challenge.

Denmark's Henrik Stiesdal and Britain's Andrew Garrad, often referred to as the ""Godfathers of wind"" for their contributions in advancing the design, manufacture and deployment of wind turbines, said Trump's war on wind appears to be a symptom of more widespread climate apathy.

Stiesdal is known for framing the early design principles for wind turbines and led the installation of the world's first offshore wind farm in 1991, while Garrad developed computer models to optimize and certify turbine and farm designs.

""I think Trump's approach is symptomatic of a general shift,"" Garrad said, in comments echoed by Stiesdal, one that is opposed to the transition from fossil fuels to renewable technologies, such as wind and solar.

""We are facing right now, a change of mood. We had a very easy beginning, then quite a big struggle, then general acceptance, and now the worm is turning. And that's something which we all have to address,"" Garrad told CNBC.

Since returning to office at the start of the year, U.S. President Donald Trump has actively sought to disrupt the development of high-profile wind projects. His push to wipe out the offshore wind industry has included stop-work orders and the removal of green incentives under former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.

""Trump is symptomatic. I mean an extreme symptom of that, but you can see it I think in all Western countries certainly, perhaps not elsewhere. And that's a big issue,"" Garrad said.

""This isn't just a wind energy problem,"" Garrad said. ""To do this sort of change is a very dangerous thing. And I think it has shown that this is a political business ... It's a personal decision by a politician, who happens to be a rather powerful one — and it has sent shockwaves around the place.""

Trump's onslaught against the wind industry has hit the business models of renewable energy giants particularly hard. Denmark's Ortsed, the world's biggest offshore wind farm group, is one notable example.

Last week, Orsted reported a net loss of 1.7 billion Danish kroner ($261.8 million) for the July-September period. The result, which was slightly better than analysts feared, was significantly down from profit of 5.17 billion Danish kroner in the same period last year.

Shares of the Copenhagen-listed company, which have fallen more than 80% from a 2021 peak, notched a fresh record low in August after the Trump administration ordered the company to halt work on a near complete windfarm.

Danish wind turbine firm Vestas has also been battling industry uncertainty, in part because of the Trump administration's policies. When asked about some of these challenges, Vestas CEO Henrik Andersen said the company has a ""well-established"" supply chain in the U.S.

""For us, we see the U.S., both customers and the buildout in the U.S., as some of our core responsibility to help the U.S. with,"" Andersen told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Nov. 5.

""Then sometimes maybe we have to get a bit of a slap that it is not everyone that likes the nature of a wind turbine. But I think, in general, … energy drives decision making and [the] cost of energy drives decision making,"" he added.

Trump has repeatedly criticized the deployment of offshore wind turbines, describing them as ""pathetic"" and ""expensive"" in a recent speech at the United Nations General Assembly.

""I'm telling you that if you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,"" Trump said on Sept. 23. The U.S. president also said climate change is the ""greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.""

Scientists have since condemned Trump's characterization of climate change, pointing out that the overwhelming consensus is that climate change is already happening, with record-breaking heatwaves, flood events and hurricanes causing substantial economic damages across the globe.

Stiesdal, who refused to comment specifically on Trump's war on wind, said there appears to be ""a fundamental misunderstanding"" from those firmly opposed to the energy transition.

""A lot of people who would be inclined to vote for hard-right parties actually benefit both from the job offerings and the cost of their energy from renewables,"" Stiesdal said.

""It's not an easy thing to fight because a lot of it is kind of visceral or fundamental in the thinking about this tribal approach,"" he continued. ""Whenever I am confronted with that, or with discussions about that, I try to emphasize energy security, the job creation, the local beneficial effects of doing renewables and the assurances you get in society.""

Stiesdal and Garrad were speaking to CNBC shortly before being presented with the 2024 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering. The prize was presented by King Charles III during a reception at St. James's Palace in London earlier this month.

Monday - Friday, 10:00 - 11:00 SIN/HK  |  0400 - 05:00 CET

This report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. You can subscribe here.

Cultural shifts are subtle yet fundamental for any company aiming to succeed beyond its home market.

When I visited Chinese electric car company Xpeng's new headquarters in Guangzhou last week, what stood out wasn't just how shiny it was compared to the building I'd visited last year, but the fluency of its global mindset, down to the small details like accurate English translations in signs and presentations. It went beyond the cursory ""innovation"" banners often seen in China.

Leaders of Xpeng's autonomous driving, robotics and flying car units each delivered 40-minute presentations entirely in English — including their decks — without any translation device. In conversation with reporters, Xpeng founder and CEO He Xiaopeng even declared a ten-year goal to generate half of the company's sales from outside China.

He has reason to be upbeat. Xpeng notched 12 straight months of more than 30,000 deliveries each, and exported a small but growing number of cars: 29,000 in just three quarters. That was more than double what Xpeng shipped from a year earlier.

Xpeng's global ambitions reflect a broader trend across China. In the last year or so, overseas expansion has become a top priority for nearly every Chinese company — an eagerness that Joe Ngai, chairman of McKinsey Greater China, said he's never seen.

""It's astonishing what this phenomenon is,"" he said, noting that fierce competition in China is driving local companies to seek higher profit margins abroad. But he cautioned it won't be easy, and that local partnerships would be important.

Overseas markets only accounted for 8% of total revenue for the 50 largest Chinese companies as of 2021, according to McKinsey. That is far below 31% in overseas revenue for the largest U.S. companies, the data showed.

I first learned about Xpeng on the sidelines of CNBC's East Tech West conference in 2018, when the Alibaba-backed startup touted its edge in autonomous driving and drew comparisons to Tesla.

But Xpeng wasn't able to release regulator-approved driver-assist systems at scale for a few years yet. Deliveries averaged just over 10,000 a month in 2022, and dipped well below that in early 2023 while rivals surged ahead.

At a small Xpeng event in Shanghai that I attended in March 2023, there were hints that the startup might have the tech — just not the product Chinese consumers wanted. The event speaker, Xinzhou Wu, head of autonomous driving, soon left to lead Nvidia's automotive chip business.

It was also in early 2023 that Xpeng brought in veteran Great Wall Motor executive Fengying Wang as president to oversee product planning and sales. Her leadership, along with the launch of a more affordable Mona M03 car, helped spark the company's turnaround. Wang remains with Xpeng today.

""Of course, it's much better when [the electric car companies have an] English-language interface,"" said Nick Kolodko, a Shanghai-based auto influencer who has lived in China for over a decade. He noted how some Chinese EV startups in Europe had in-car AI assistants that didn't support local languages.

He's since observed some Chinese automakers granting their overseas teams more control over the last 18 months or so, though he said there's still a gap with European rivals in shaping a compelling brand narrative.

Critically for Xpeng, it secured a $700 million investment from German auto giant Volkswagen in July 2023. The two companies have gradually expanded the partnership to include technological development.

Down the road, ""Chinese EV makers can also take a lot of [intellectual property] fees from such [tech] collaboration,"" said George Chen, managing director and co-chair of digital practice for The Asia Group. ""This will be significant because 30, 40 years ago, European carmakers and American carmakers [were] doing exactly the same thing in Chinese markets.""

For now, Xpeng is taking the first step beyond exporting cars and local production.

The company opened its first European factory in Austria in August, and plans to produce tens of thousands of cars there next year, according to Brian Gu, co-president of Xpeng. A former JPMorgan executive, Gu has been with Xpeng since its early days and helped the startup build ties with Wall Street ahead of its U.S. and Hong Kong listings.

Xpeng is set to release earnings on Monday. In the first half of 2025, Xpeng claimed to be the best-selling Chinese new-energy vehicle startup brand in Norway, France, Singapore and Israel.

""The whole overseas expansion of Chinese companies will be part of the global business landscape for the next five years,"" McKinsey's Ngai said, ""and I have zero doubts about it.""

Weiwen Han, Bain & Co.'s Asia-Pacific retail practice leader, said China's sales ""month"" could surpass U.S. Cyber Week sales and continue to grow steadily.

Fred Hu, Chairman and CEO of Primavera Capital, said China's economy will be in much better shape once consumer spending normalizes.

Georges Elhedery, CEO of HSBC, discussed the impact of tariffs on global trade and added that China's economic rebalancing is a ""welcome development.""

China's exports dip. Shipments of Chinese goods fell in October for the first time in more than a year as businesses slowed their ramp-up of orders to pre-empt tariffs.

Uneasy U.S.-China truce. Beijing has formalized agreements to delay restrictions on certain rare-earth exports for a year.

Luckin's second act. Jinyi Guo, CEO of Luckin Coffee, said the company is preparing to relist in the U.S. five years after an accounting scandal. It will face new Chinese IPO rules to do so.

The one thing that was different from Xpeng AI day from its previous tech day, is that it is talking more about its ambition oversea as a brand, not just as a EV maker, because it is pushing out all these other physical AI products beyond just an electric vehicle.

— Kevin Xu, founder and CIO of Interconnected Capital

Chinese stock markets traded mixed following Tuesday's session on Wall Street, where investors sold off technology names and drove a rally in more risk-off parts of the market.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 0.81%, while mainland's CSI 300 lost 0.13%.

The offshore Chinese yuan last traded at 7.1189 against the dollar.

SoftBank is selling its entire stake in Nvidia — but not for the reasons you might think.

In its earnings statement released Tuesday, the Japanese group said that it had sold 32.1 million Nvidia shares in October for $5.83 billion.

At first blush, this could be read as a sign that Nvidia's high valuations are causing SoftBank some unease. And if SoftBank — which infamously pumped $18.5 billion into WeWork only to value it at $2.9 billion eventually — is tamping down on its usual optimism regarding its investments, then retail traders should probably pay attention.

Adding to such worries are comments by Michael Burry — who bet against subprime mortgages before they caused a whole financial crisis in 2008 — on major artificial intelligence companies.

Burry wrote Monday in a post on X that those firms are ""understating depreciation"" of AI chips, which ""artificially boosts earnings — one of the more common frauds of the modern era.""  CNBC could not independently confirm that companies were practicing this.

This doesn't seem to be SoftBank's concern, however. A person familiar with the group's sale told CNBC that it had nothing to do with AI valuations. On the contrary, cash from offloading Nvidia chips will be redirected to SoftBank's $22.5 billion investment in OpenAI, the person said.

Burry said in his post that he will reveal ""more details"" on Nov. 25, and exhorted readers to ""stay tuned."" That might not be enough enticement for SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son.

— CNBC's Yun Li, April Roach and Dylan Butts contributed to this report.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closes at a fresh high. The S&P 500 also rose on Tuesday stateside, but the Nasdaq Composite retreated as investors rotated out of tech. Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose Wednesday, though Softbank shares sank as much as 10%.

Luckin Coffee is looking to relist in the U.S. That's according to the coffee chain's co-founder and CEO Jinyi Guo, but a company spokesperson said it doesn't have a ""clear timeline."" Luckin was delisted from the Nasdaq stock exchange in June 2020 over a fraud case.

AMD sees 35% annual growth. CEO Lisa Su said Tuesday that the chipmaker's revenue over the next three to five years will be driven by ""insatiable"" demand for AI chips. Gross margins would be between 55% to 58%, higher than analysts expected.

Elements of U.S.-China trade deal took effect Monday. Washington extended for a year its agreement to keep its ""reciprocal"" tariff rate at 10%. In return, Beijing rolled back several restrictions on the export of rare earths. But analysts say the truce remains fragile.

Bitcoin consolidates within a mild bearish range between $97K and $111.9K. Accumulation near $100K offers support, but resistance above $106K caps upside. ETF outflows, low leverage, and persistent put demand reflect a cautious market awaiting renewed conviction.

Over the past week, Bitcoin briefly slipped below $100K, extending the broader downtrend that has persisted since early October. This move pushed the market into a mild bearish regime, with prices now trading beneath the short-term holder cost basis.

In this edition, we analyze the forces driving the rebound toward $106K using on-chain cost-basis models and accumulation–distribution dynamics. We then pivot to off-chain indicators, exploring ETFs, futures markets and options market sentiment to assess whether this recovery reflects genuine demand or a short-lived relief rally.

Since early October, with Bitcoin breaking below the short-term holder cost basis (🔵), a range suffering from the lack of conviction and low liquidity has been confirmed. Since then, price action has trended lower, approaching the -1 STD band near $97.5K.

This recent drawdown resembles the contraction phases seen during June–October 2024 and February–April 2025, where prices oscillated within a defined lower range before recovery. Consequently, unless Bitcoin reclaims the short-term holder cost basis (~$111.9K) as support, the probability of revisiting the lower bound of this range remains elevated.

Building on this structural setup, the sub-$100K zone has emerged as a critical battleground where seller exhaustion is beginning to take shape. Much of the downward pressure stems from top buyers among short-term holders, who have been realizing heavy losses during the decline.

As Bitcoin tested $98K, the STH Realized Profit-Loss Ratio fell below 0.21, meaning over 80% of realized value came from coins sold at a loss. This intensity of capitulation briefly exceeded the last three major washouts of this cycle, underscoring how top-heavy the market has become and how pivotal the $100K level remains for near-term stability.

Turning to the demand side, the Cost Basis Distribution Heatmap reveals a clear buildup of realized supply around the sub-$100K zone, both before and after the rebound to $106K. The intensifying heat in this range signals renewed accumulation by buyers absorbing capitulation flows. This dynamic completes the picture; pairing seller exhaustion with steady accumulation, creating the foundation for a short-term recovery even within a broader bearish structure.

Conversely, a dense supply cluster between $106K and $118K continues to cap upward momentum, as many investors use this range to exit near breakeven. This overhang of latent supply creates a natural resistance zone where rallies may stall, suggesting that sustained recovery will require renewed inflows strong enough to absorb this wave of distribution.

The current market structure confirms a continuation of the downtrend that began in early October. A dense supply zone above $106K continues to exert sell pressure, and reclaiming the short-term holder cost basis (~$111.9K) remains a key prerequisite for any sustainable shift toward recovery.

On the demand side, the Realized Profit of Short-Term Holders (a proxy for new investor momentum) has been notably weak since June 2025, reflecting a lack of fresh inflows. For Bitcoin to push through the $106K–$118K top-buyer cluster, this metric must reverse higher, signalling renewed conviction and stronger demand from new market entrants.

Transitioning to the off-chain section, we first gauge the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF markets. US spot Bitcoin ETFs have shifted to modest outflows in recent weeks, mirroring muted price action and waning momentum. After strong mid-year inflows, aggregate demand has flattened, suggesting a pause in institutional accumulation.

Historically, such neutral flow regimes align with market consolidation, where conviction rebuilds before the next directional move. A decisive return of inflows would signal renewed institutional confidence, while prolonged outflows could reinforce a more defensive market tone.

Bitcoin perpetual futures funding rates remain subdued across major exchanges, highlighting the lack of speculative appetite in derivatives markets. Since the leverage flush in October, both funding rates and open interest have drifted lower, signalling that traders are staying cautious with limited directional exposure.

This absence of aggressive positioning reflects a phase of market hesitation, often seen before volatility re-emerges. For now, the derivatives landscape remains quiet and balanced, leaning toward neutral sentiment rather than speculation-driven momentum.

Speculators' reluctance to use leverage for directional bets extends beyond Bitcoin. Using our newly launched Multi-Asset Explorer, we can assess key futures indicators, funding rates and open interest across the top 100 digital assets.

The first heatmap shows a clear cooling in market-wide funding intensity since mid-year, interrupted only by brief spikes. This broad moderation suggests that traders have de-risked, with leverage and conviction subdued across both Bitcoin and altcoins. Overall, derivatives sentiment remains cautious, and liquidity continues to thin across the board.

Open interest trends across digital asset futures reveal a sharp decline in speculative engagement, most evident in altcoin markets. The heatmap shows a sustained dominance of blue tones, reflecting ongoing contraction in open interest and a clear absence of risk appetite.

While Bitcoin maintains relatively stable positioning, leverage in altcoins has unwound to near cycle lows, with little sign of fresh capital rotation. This pattern underscores a defensive stance among traders, prioritizing capital preservation over speculation. In essence, altcoin derivatives activity has thinned materially—positioning remains light, conviction low, and market attention firmly centred on Bitcoin.

Put protection remains elevated, indicating traders continue to pay a premium for downside insurance. Hedging remains the dominant theme, with short-term expiries pricing roughly 11% implied volatility skew in favour of puts. Three-month and six-month expiries show a softer bias, with 8 and 4 volatility points of downside preference, respectively.

For now, the absence of a clear catalyst limits the potential for skew to shift in favor of calls. The options market continues to price in a retest of the $100K level and a potential break below. However, what will ultimately matter is how the market reacts if that test occurs, rather than the mere pricing of the event.

Transitioning from skew to volatility, the broader volatility environment has settled into a holding pattern. The DVOL, Bitcoin's implied volatility index that measures the market's expectation of future volatility derived from options prices, remains elevated but range-bound.

Since the October 10 liquidation event, volatility has shifted to a higher regime, oscillating between 40 and 50. This range suggests that the market has adjusted to a higher baseline of uncertainty without entering a state of panic. Volatility remains supported by macroeconomic risk factors and cautious sentiment; however, the absence of further expansion points to consolidation rather than capitulation.

Looking at the end-of-November expiry, open interest clusters heavily around and just below the $100K strike, making it a critical battleground. A decisive break below this level could trigger dealer hedging flows that amplify downside volatility.

If spot retests the $100K area, brief intraday dips below are possible, but a sustained close beneath this threshold would likely mark a shift toward extreme bearish sentiment and potentially ignite another wave of volatility.

Finally, option flows over the past week reinforce this cautious positioning. Activity was concentrated on the put side, with notable buying between the 108K and 95K strikes.

Some flows reflected outright long protection, such as the 100K strike expiring November 28, while others were structured as calendar spreads, for example, buying the 108K November expiry while selling the 108K December expiry. This pattern effectively captures the current stance; traders anticipate near-term turbulence but remain neutral to moderately optimistic over the longer term.

The next potential catalyst is the resolution of the U.S. government shutdown, an outcome that would likely be welcomed by markets. However, ongoing tariff tensions are expected to keep volatility elevated through Q4. Until the December 10 FOMC meeting, risk appetite is likely to remain muted, as the event is broadly perceived as neutral.

For traders, the 25-delta skew remains the primary gauge for tracking shifts in sentiment. A sustained flattening or reversal toward call bias would signal that market participants are beginning to regain confidence in the upside.

Bitcoin continues to trade within a mild bearish range, defined by strong resistance between $106K–$118K and key structural support near $97.5K–$100K. The market remains under the influence of top-heavy supply, with short-term holders still realizing losses. On-chain data highlighted a brief accumulation near $100K, suggesting localized support, yet without a decisive reclaim of the short-term holders' cost basis (~$111.9), upside momentum is likely to stay constrained.

Off-chain indicators also echo this cautious tone. ETF outflows, muted funding rates, and low open interest point to subdued speculative engagement, while options traders continue to favor downside protection around the $100K line.

Overall, both on-chain and off-chain signals portray a market in a state of consolidation, stabilizing yet not yet ready to confirm a bullish reversal. Until renewed inflows or a clear macro catalyst emerge, Bitcoin appears bound to oscillate within this $97K–$111.9K corridor, with $100K remaining the psychological line of defence.

Overnight crypto gains once again evaporated by U.S. morning hours as bitcoin BTC$101,691.35 tumbled back below $102,000 on Wednesday.

Briefly topping $105,000 earlier today, the largest crypto nosedived 3% in just a couple hours as U.S. traditional markets opened. It wasn't just bitcoin; ether ETH$3,439.10 fell almost 5% below $3,400 during the same period, while Solana SOL$153.35, XRP$2.3489 and other altcoin majors suffered similar declines.

Crypto-related U.S. stocks are also taking a beating in the early session. USDC stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) dropped 9.5% after its third quarter earnings, while crypto miners with data center ambitions including Bitfarms (BITF), Bitdeer (BTDR), Cipher Mining (CIFR), Hive Digital (HIVE), Hut 8 (HUT) and IREN continued selling off, down 5%-10%.

Lackluster price action during U.S. trading hours has been a staple for the past few weeks now on crypto markets. Showcasing the weak American investor appetite is the so-called Coinbase Premium, a popular gauge for U.S. investor demand, which has been negative since late October.

The Coinbase Premium measures the price difference for spot BTC on Coinbase, widely used crypto exchange by U.S. customers and many institutional market participants, compared to prices on Binance, the leading exchange by trading volume that's popular among offshore retail users.

That's the metric's longest negative streak since March-April, when BTC fell to $75,000 from above $100,000 in a market-wide correction.

The shift in U.S. sentiment coincides with growing uncertainty around the Federal Reserve's next move since the central bank's October meeting. What had been widely assumed before the meeting to be a straightforward path to another rate cut in December, has now turned into an internal battle among policymakers.

According to a recent Wall Street Journal report, the central bank is facing an internal divide, with policymakers split over whether the greater risk now is persistent inflation or a softening labor market. That division has left the path to a December rate cut far less clear than it appeared just weeks ago.

The recent government shutdown, which temporarily froze key employment and inflation data releases, has only widened that divide by forcing policymakers to lean on private data and anecdotes, the report said.

A December cut is now a ""tossup,"" the report said, and even deciding on lowering rates could come with guidance of higher bar for further reductions.

Since the Fed's October meeting, U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs saw more than $1.8 billion in net outflows, pointing to that uncertainty around the Fed's move, and the lack of clear positive catalysts, is keeping BTC on edge.

The broader crypto market outlook remains subdued due to macro uncertainty, but large Ethereum investors are using the downturn to accumulate substantial holdings.

On-chain data reveals a series of major purchases by institutional-scale investors, as Ethereum forms a local bottom, potentially ending the market selloff that began in late October.

A newly created wallet bought 10,000 ETH worth roughly $34 million last Wednesday, as Ethereum formed a local bottom around $3,200. The same entity then purchased another 10,000 ETH yesterday, bringing its total holdings to $70 million, per Arkham Intelligence data.

Separately, another whale acquired 24,007 ETH, worth over $82 million, via Galaxy Digital's over-the-counter (OTC) desk, according to Etherscan data.

The most significant purchase, however, came from a large investor who bought nearly 58,811 AaveETH, worth $206 million, on Wednesday.

The activity suggests large players are viewing current price levels as a strategic buying opportunity.

“The size and speed—OTC fills and exchange withdrawals—suggest institutional participants or treasury buyers rather than retail,” Rachel Lin, CEO and Co-Founder of SynFutures, told Decrypt.

These buyers are likely positioning for medium-term upside, Lin explained, tolerating near-term volatility in anticipation of catalysts such as policy easing or institutional product flows.

“Accumulation can continue if macro tail-risks don't re-spike,” Lin noted, though she emphasized that macroeconomic conditions remain a “gating factor.”

Other catalysts beyond the upcoming Fusaka upgrade are already in play, including institutional OTC demand and “derivatives funding and borrow-to-buy behavior—when whales borrow stablecoins to buy spot, it amplifies rallies,” according to Lin.

Ethereum has recovered approximately 10% from its recent low and is currently trading around $3,533, according to CoinGecko data.

On prediction market Myriad, launched by Decrypt's parent company Dastan, users place a 69% chance on Ethereum's next move taking it to $4,000 rather than $2,500.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum has benefited from institutional adoption, the launch of crypto ETFs, and lighter federal regulation of cryptocurrencies.

But those catalysts are now baked into Ethereum's price, and economic headwinds are slowing its gains.

The cryptocurrency could still be a good long-term investmen; just don't expect similar returns as in the past.

10 stocks we like better than Ethereum ›

Some cryptocurrencies have surged in value in recent years, and one big winner has been Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), which is up an impressive 670% over the past five years compared to the S&P 500's 90% gains.

Cryptocurrency investors looking back at Ethereum's impressive rise may be wondering if the same returns will be replicated in the future. There are certainly some reasons to be bullish about the crypto, but as any investment disclaimer will tell you, past performance isn't an indicator of future gains.

Here's why Ethereum could continue to be a good investment, and why it's unlikely to be a millionaire-maker.

One of the biggest draws for investing in Ethereum compared to other cryptocurrencies is that financial institutions use the Ethereum blockchain to build some of their financial technology on. For example, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft, and Visa all use Ethereum's blockchain as part of their technology and financial services infrastructure.

That institutional backing gives the crypto a level of credibility that's made it popular among investors, helping it climb in value to become the world's second-most-valuable crypto after Bitcoin. That popularity helped boost Ethereum's value when the first Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launched. Since they debuted, there's about $20 billion in assets under management in Ethereum ETFs.

What's more, while many cryptocurrencies are created as a joke or as a meme coin to promote some event or company temporarily, Ethereum is far more established. The cryptocurrency's blockchain has more than 16,000 developers -- the largest of any cryptocurrency. That makes it continually useful in real-world settings and far more likely to have staying power.

It's understandable why some people are looking to Ethereum to make them a millionaire. After all, a more than 600% increase in value in just five years has made some people a lot of money.

But there were some big catalysts for the crypto that led to those returns, which are unlikely to be repeated. For one, stocks and crypto prices surged during the pandemic as the government sent out stimulus checks, and some people used that money to invest.

Two separate catalysts in 2024 also pushed Ethereum and other cryptos higher: The launch of Ethereum ETFs and the election of Trump. I already mentioned how ETFs helped push Ethereum higher, and President Trump's reelection led to the federal government having a lighter touch on crypto regulation, which helped boost Ethereum's price, at least initially.

What's more, there are some current headwinds for the crypto market that could hold Ethereum back from producing high returns. For one, the labor market is slowing. Jobs data from private firms show that layoffs in October were the highest they've been in 22 years. When people are concerned about their jobs, they're less likely to invest in riskier assets like crypto.

If layoffs continue or the U.S. economy slows down significantly, investors will likely shift their attention to safer investments like bonds. So far, the economy still seems to be chugging along, but one only needs to look back to April, when President Trump announced sweeping tariffs, to see just how quickly crypto values can fall when investors get spooked. Ethereum plunged 20% in just over a week when tariffs were announced.

I think there's a case for owning some Ethereum, especially as more financial institutions adopt its blockchain. But it's unlikely the cryptocurrency will have the same gains it's seen over the past five years or mint millionaires, given the hurdles the crypto industry is facing right now.

Ethereum's native token, Ether ETHUSD, is “seconds away” from entering a convincing breakout stage, according to analyst Kamran Asghar.

Key takeaways:

Ethereum is nearing a breakout from a falling wedge, with a target of $4,400.

A bullish crossover in Ethe's MACD indicator supports the short-term upside outlook.

ETH price may rise above $4,400 by mid-December

As of Wednesday, ETH painted a textbook falling wedge structure while its Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator signaled a bull cross. 

The falling wedge typically suggests that bearish momentum is fading. In Ether's case, the structure has been developing since early October and is now approaching a breakout point near $3,560, which also aligns with the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level.

A decisive move above this resistance could confirm a breakout, setting the stage for a rally toward $4,415 by mid-December, which is roughly 25% higher than current levels. 

The target corresponds to the 0.786 Fib level, which previously acted as a key resistance zone.

Adding weight to the bullish outlook, Asghar highlighted that Ethereum's MACD, a momentum indicator, is “seconds away” from completing a bullish crossover.

The MACD compares two moving averages to detect shifts in trend strength. When the faster blue line crosses above the slower orange line, it suggests that buying pressure is overtaking selling momentum.

Historically, similar MACD flips during consolidation phases have preceded both short-term and long-term rallies for ETH.

What could change the bullish view?

A pullback from the wedge's upper trendline, however, risks invalidating the breakout setup, instead pushing ETH's price toward the lower trendline, which is around the $3,000-3,200 range.

In the worst-case scenario, the price may consolidate until it reaches the apex of the wedge, where its two trendlines converge, at around $2,710.

Ethereum's MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands indicate a downside outlook, suggesting that ETH may slip toward its –0.5σ band (teal) at around $2,870 after closing below its mean valuation level.

Throughout Ether's history, similar breakdowns below the mean band have preceded extended sell-offs, often pushing ETH's price to or below the teal– 0.5σ band before a recovery began.

Opinion by: Kamal Mokeddem, General Partner at Finality Capital

The prevailing institutional narrative surrounding altcoins is as follows: If you want crypto exposure, simply buy Bitcoin and move on. 

Bitcoin now has ETFs and has outperformed nearly every other digital asset. Unlike 2017 or 2021, there has been no broad altcoin rally this cycle. At its peak in 2021, more than 2.6 million tokens were live; today, there are more than 42 million. No wonder many people believe the game is over. 

This perspective is lazy and wrong. The absence of an “altcoin season” doesn't mean there is a lack of opportunity. It means the market is maturing. 

The free-for-all token rallies of 2017 and 2021 are behind us — oversupply, poor tokenomics and retail fatigue made sure of that. Confusing the end of indiscriminate speculation with the demise of altcoins is to miss the real story. These tokens are no longer trying to compete as a currency. Instead, they're evolving into one of the most powerful growth marketing tools we've ever seen.

Bitcoin isn't the benchmark

Bitcoin will not win as the preferred monetary asset. All tokens have some non-zero monetary premium. The one most likely to gain the most significant monetary premium is the one that's used the most as a means of payment, which is expected to be the native token that hosts the most popular Web3 applications. It's still too early to say whether this will be Ether, SOL, or something else, but it almost certainly will not be Bitcoin.

Altcoins are shifting from speculative chips to fundamental business primitives. They're not about replacing Bitcoin. They're about accelerating adoption, pulling users out of Web2 silos and bootstrapping new networks faster and cheaper than any company in history.

The consequences of such an adoption will change the internet as we know it. The value of Web2 companies depends on their ability to hoard and monetize data. Once that data becomes portable, verifiable and user-controlled, the moat that sustained these monopolies starts to erode. 

Over the next five years, we should expect the first year-over-year revenue declines at the Web2 giants. Google and Facebook, whose margins depend on data lock-in, are the most at risk. Apple, meanwhile, benefits regardless — whether apps are Web2 or Web3, they still run on iPhones. Amazon's logistics moat will remain, but even there, tokenized networks could erode its dominance.

Altcoins aren't dead. They've simply found their purpose as growth engines disguised as assets.

ZkTLS and verifiable data

The biggest unlock for altcoins is technical. Zero-knowledge transport layer security (zkTLS) — a mechanism for cryptographically verifying any data exchanged over HTTPS — now makes it possible to take siloed Web2 data and turn it into verifiable inputs on Web3.

That opens the floodgates for new applications. In fintech, a worker can prove their paystub onchain and immediately access a USDC loan on a debit card — no payday lender required. In advertising, influencers can tie posts to verified conversions and get paid without opaque intermediaries. Identity-driven services like ride-share drivers can port their history across platforms and earn token incentives to switch providers.

The implications go further. Remittances could bypass money transfer monopolies. Tokenized credit scores could expand financial access in emerging markets. In healthcare, patients could prove their medical records without exposing private data. 

In e-commerce, verified purchase histories could unlock loyalty rewards across multiple platforms. In the infrastructure sector, projects are already utilizing tokens to construct decentralized 5G networks. Even in AI, networks are showing how tokens can coordinate global compute and data.

In every case, tokens aren't just abstract assets, but incentives — the fuel that moves users from legacy incumbents to new challengers. In Web2, companies like Uber or DoorDash spent billions on subsidies to lure drivers and customers. Tokens enable startups to achieve the same effect with far less capital, thereby compressing the time it takes to bootstrap a two-sided marketplace.

There are already examples of this in crypto-native markets. A new exchange can “vampire attack” incumbents by rewarding traders who can prove their volumes elsewhere. Wherever data can be verified, tokens can be deployed to redirect attention and liquidity.

Now matters because of maturity

All of this is possible because the crypto tech stack has matured. In the early days, only hyper-technical founders could ship products. Now, the building blocks — databases, storage, identity layers — exist, opening the door for business-first founders to build billion-dollar companies in Web3.

That's precisely how the internet evolved. In the 1990s, technical founders were replaced by business operators once the stack stabilized. The result wasn't fewer companies — it was Amazon, Google and Facebook. We're approaching the same inflection point in the crypto space.

The timing matters. The trillion-dollar advertising market is ripe for disruption. Similarly, the fintech, social media and cloud infrastructure industries are also experiencing growth. Web2 monopolies depend on hoarding user data. Web3 unlocks it. Tokens serve as the incentive layer that enables switching.

For institutions, the biggest mistake is assuming Bitcoin ETFs equal crypto exposure. Bitcoin may remain the reserve asset, but the real venture-style upside is happening in tokens that power applications. To ignore them is like ignoring the internet in 2000 because Pets.com went bust.

The risk is asymmetric. Allocate now, while the space is unpopular and valuations are reasonable, or wait until incumbents are being disrupted and pay 10 times more for the same exposure. 

Either way, adoption is coming. The only question is whether you'll participate early or arrive late.

The Bitcoin dominance has remained quite high over the last year, holding firmly above 50% and preventing altcoins from making any meaningful recovery. Even now, the dominance has climbed close to 60%, showing that Bitcoin is still determining the direction of the entire market. However, there has been a development that could change the trajectory of the Bitcoin dominance and put altcoins in the spotlight once again, highlighted by crypto analyst Unichartz.

Bitcoin Dominance Breaks Below 50 EMA

Since 2023, the Bitcoin dominance has remained firmly above the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), showing immense strength around this level. Even through market crashes, the digital asset has maintained its dominance, and with each passing year, the trendline has continued to rise. As long as the Bitcoin dominance stayed above the 50 EMA, it showed it would continue to dominate, but this is changing now.

According to the post by Unichartz, it shows that the Bitcoin dominance has now crashed below the 50-Day EMA for the first time in almost one year. This comes as the dominance lost its footing above 60% and has failed to reclaim its position above it.

Naturally, there has been an attempt to reclaim the 50-Day EMA once again. However, this attempt failed after the brief surge above 63% in early October was thwarted by the market-wide crash on October 10. Since then, the dominance has remained below the 50 EMA and has now spent a full consecutive month below this critical level.

What This Means For The Crypto Market

Historically, the altcoin season has only begun when the Bitcoin dominance has seen a decline. This trend has held strong through the years, and even through the current cycle, has prevented the rise of another altcoin season.

However, with the crash below the 50 EMA, the analyst predicts that the Bitcoin dominance is about to see a massive crash. It shows that the dominance will fall below 40% if it fails to reclaim the 50 EMA soon. Such a crash would give room for altcoins to actually run as the focus moves away from Bitcoin.

With the Altcoin Season Index sitting at a low 31 at the time of this writing, it shows that a crash in the Bitcoin dominance is sorely needed for altcoins to rise again. However, the analyst explains that if the dominance does reclaim the 50 EMA, then Bitcoin's lead may be extended for longer before attention rotates back to altcoin.

That's according to a report Wednesday (Nov. 12) by Bloomberg News, which notes this move is part of a wider push by financial institutions to expand their digital asset business.

The token, which represents dollar deposits with the bank, lets users send and receive money using the Base blockchain, affiliated with Coinbase, Naveen Mallela, global co-head of J.P. Morgan's blockchain division Kinexys, told Bloomberg in an interview. 

This lets payments process within seconds and on a 24/7 basis, instead of days and confined solely to business hours.

The report says the launch follows a trial run of JPM Coin conducted in partnership with companies like Mastercard, Coinbase and B2C2. J.P. Morgan plans to eventually open the token to its own clients' customers and expand to other currency denominations and other blockchains, Mallela said. 

As Bloomberg notes, the launch is happening at a time when financial institutions such as Citigroup, Santander, Deutsche Bank and PayPal are experimenting more with digital assets. It comes in the wake of the GENIUS Act in the U.S. which regulates stablecoins, another increasingly popular type of digital currency.

As covered here last year, deposit tokens are digital representations of traditional bank deposits, issued by regulated financial institutions and backed 1-to-1 by fiat currency held in reserve. 

“Unlike cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or ethereum, which are decentralized and often subject to volatility, deposit tokens offer stability and reliability by ensuring each token corresponds to a specific amount of fiat currency,” PYMNTS wrote. “This backing by real-world assets provides a layer of trust and security that is necessary for widespread adoption.”

The main appeal of these tokens, that report added, comes from their stability. Each token is backed by fiat currency, giving them the same reliability as traditional bank deposits. This stability is critical for mainstream financial transactions and could help ease concerns about the volatility seen in cryptocurrencies.

And because deposit tokens are issued by regulated banks, they adhere to the same stringent regulatory frameworks as normal banking services. This compliance provides assurance that deposit tokens can be trusted by both consumers and businesses, addressing one of the obstacles to the wider adoption of digital currencies, PYMNTS wrote.

“We think that stablecoins get a lot of buzz, but for institutional clients, deposit-based products offer a compelling alternative,” Mallela told Bloomberg. “These can be yield-bearing.”

Oops, something went wrong

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) has come a long way when it comes to crypto. At one point, they used to look at anything blockchain or digital assets with skepticism.

CEO Jamie Dimon, who famously called Bitcoin a “fraud” in 2017, has since softened his stance, acknowledging that “the blockchain is real.”

Analysts view the move as a full-circle moment for Wall Street's largest bank, signaling crypto's acceptance in mainstream finance.

But the bank has now made another milestone move that reinforces the bank's growing role in the digital asset ecosystem.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. has officially launched its blockchain-powered deposit token, JPM Coin (JPMD), for institutional clients, as reported by Bloomberg on Nov. 12.

The token, representing dollar deposits at the world's largest bank, enables instant money transfers on Coinbase's Base blockchain, operating 24/7 instead of traditional banking hours.

According to Naveen Mallela, global co-head of Kinexys, JPMorgan's blockchain division, the launch follows successful trials involving Mastercard, Coinbase, and B2C2.

The bank plans to extend access to clients' clients and introduce multi-currency support, including a euro-backed version under the trademark JPME, pending regulatory approval.

JPMorgan is steadily expanding its blockchain use cases. By the end of the year, the bank is planning to allow institutional clients to use Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) as collateral for loans.

“We think that stablecoins get a lot of buzz, but for institutional clients, deposit-based tokens offer a compelling, yield-bearing alternative,” Mallela said.

Crypto Confession: 'I decided to touch my parents' investment. They had no idea. Fast forward, I lost everything'

Deposit tokens like JPM Coin differ from stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) or USD Coin (USDC).

Deposit tokens are issued by licensed banks and represent claims on actual deposits held within the banking system, making them subject to strict financial oversight and backed by insured funds. They are essentially “bank money on blockchain,” enabling real-time settlement between institutions while retaining the safety of traditional deposits.

Stablecoins, on the other hand, are issued by private fintech or crypto firms outside the banking framework. Though typically pegged to the U.S. dollar, they rely on the issuer's reserve transparency and governance.

While stablecoins dominate retail crypto use and decentralized finance, deposit tokens appeal to regulated, institutional finance seeking blockchain efficiency without compromising compliance or risk management.

Both concepts align with recent developments under the GENIUS Act in the United States, which formalizes stablecoin regulation and encourages innovation in tokenized banking.

Industry peers, including Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Banco Santander, and PayPal, are also exploring blockchain settlement tools.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) has launched a new deposit token called “JPM Coin” for its institutional clients. The move marks another step in the bank's push into digital assets and blockchain payments.





JPM Coin represents U.S. dollar deposits held at JPMorgan and lets users send and receive money through a public blockchain within seconds, rather than waiting several days for traditional transfers. The service currently operates on Coinbase's (COIN) Base blockchain, according to Naveen Mallela, global co-head of the bank's blockchain arm, Kinexys.

The bank said the rollout followed a successful trial with Mastercard (MA), Coinbase, and B2C2. It plans to offer the service to more clients and expand to other currencies and blockchains once regulators give approval.

Deposit tokens are digital versions of bank deposits that move on blockchain networks. Unlike stablecoins, which are issued by private firms and backed by assets like bonds, deposit tokens are backed by money already held in the bank.

Mallela said deposit tokens may appeal more to large institutions because they can earn interest, which stablecoin holders do not receive. JPM Coin will also be accepted as collateral on Coinbase (COIN), adding to its usefulness for digital finance firms.

JPMorgan is moving ahead of other major banks in using blockchain for payments. Its Kinexys network already handles billions in transactions daily, and the new JPM Coin could help meet growing demand for faster, round-the-clock transfers.

With JPM Coin, JPMorgan is strengthening its lead in digital finance, showing how traditional banks are moving closer to real-time, blockchain-based payments.

Currently, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on JPMorgan stock based on 11 Buys and six Holds. The average JPM stock price target of $340.29 indicates 7.82% upside potential from current levels.

Oops, something went wrong

If you've attended any finance panels recently or glanced at the latest fund launches, you've probably heard about tokenisation, as it's everywhere these days. And with good reason: more than $34 billion in real-world assets have already moved on-chain, from tokenised US Treasuries to “digital gold” and even real estate. All of which makes it easy to believe that finance has finally reached its programmable, borderless future.

But look closer, and the reality proves more intricate. According to recent research, most tokenised assets barely trade — BUIDL, the largest RWA token by market capitalisation, has only 85 holders, 30 active wallets, and 104 monthly transfers. Liquidity is thin, market-makers remain on the sidelines, and the legal part, from wrappers to cross-border settlement, is still incomplete.

So why aren't RWAs working yet? Let's try to figure it out.

For all its excitement, the RWA market remains trapped between promise and proof. And if I had to name the first thing that comes to mind when asked what's holding tokenisation back, it'd be liquidity.

Most tokenised assets, whether Treasuries, funds, or private credit, hardly trade once issued, a reality confirmed by research revealing that “RWA tokens exhibit low trading volumes, long holding periods, and limited investor participation.” That meagre activity widens spreads, clouds valuations, and discourages market-makers who lack the depth to commit capital. The result is a market that looks liquid on paper but behaves like a closed loop — attractive to issue, difficult to exit.

Even if liquidity forms, regulation is the next bottleneck. When rules are consistent, markets follow; when they aren't, progress stalls, and, so far, tokenisation falls into the latter. Every jurisdiction defines digital securities differently: MiCA in Europe, the DSS in the UK, Project Guardian in Singapore, and case law in the US. That means each project demands bespoke legal work and compliance mapping — a reminder that geography still decides what tokenisation can and cannot be.

The infrastructure needs to be ready, too. Yet custody, settlement, and valuation systems remain fragmented, with most pilots still running outside core banking rails. As a recent market report observed, without trusted oracles and interoperable standards, tokenisation cannot yet deliver its full promise of instant settlement and collateral efficiency. This keeps institutions from treating tokens as balance-sheet assets or eligible collateral, preventing the market from scaling in any meaningful way.

So, each of these gaps shows that tokenisation may not be short on ambition, but it's certainly short on foundations. The real question now is how to lay them quickly enough for the market to stand on its own.

If tokenisation is to move from promise to practice, it needs firmer ground beneath, and in practice, that ground is credible, functioning secondary markets.

Such dedicated secondary venues as MAS's Project Guardian liquidity pools or the UK's Digital Securities Sandbox clearly prove that when issuers, custodians, and market-makers operate on shared standards, depth follows. Liquidity incentives, transparent pricing feeds, and interoperable disclosure rules could replicate that at scale, which could finally make on-chain assets investable, not just issuable.

Just as quickly, legal certainty must evolve, because a token that cannot prove title or settle under recognised custody rules will always sit at the periphery of finance. I think the solution to the current patchwork lies in standardised wrappers and mutual recognition across jurisdictions. That would finally let institutions treat tokenised assets as balance-sheet eligible, paving the way for global issuance and usability.

Eventually, unified-ledger prototypes, tokenised collateral networks introduced by leading global banks, and other market-grade experiments point to a future where custody, pricing, and settlement move on the same rails. So, interoperability is no longer a nice-to-have — it's a prerequisite. Once those rails are trusted and connected, capital may circulate through tokenised markets as efficiently as code.

If layers converge, tokenisation would go beyond the experiment and become the backbone of modern market architecture. But if they don't, it risks ending where NFTs did: with innovation outpacing adoption and a cycle of hype that never quite turns into habit. The industry still has time to decide which story it wants to write — but not much.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) plans to operationalize its Singapore Dollar wholesale CBDC testnet this week to support live tokenization trials. The move will provide infrastructure for cross border settlement and tokenization transactions.

MAS is adopting a hybrid approach, providing both a wholesale CBDC and an interoperability solution to interface with other DLT networks. 

The announcement came during a Layer One Summit speech by MAS Deputy Managing Director Leong Sing Chiong, in which he discussed several tokenization initiatives. However, he rated overall tokenization progress as “mixed, uneven and patchy” both across markets and within industries.

“Trusted, open and interoperable networks will not emerge by chance. Hard work and heavy lifting are required,” he said. Singapore has been advancing this work through Project Guardian pilots and its Global Layer One initiative, which aims to develop tokenization standards and an ecosystem.

Key Takeaways

Around the world, central banks are accelerating efforts to issue their own digital currencies, known as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), to modernize financial systems and reduce reliance on private cryptocurrencies and cash.

As of November 2025, 137 countries and currency unions, representing nearly the entire global economy, are actively exploring CBDCs.

Yet, only a handful have successfully launched fully operational systems.

This week, the United Arab Emirates became the latest nation to take a major step forward, launching a pilot of its Digital Dirham, signaling its ambitions to join the small but growing list of countries experimenting with government-backed digital currencies.

CBDCs are a digital form of a nation's fiat currency, issued and regulated by its central bank.

Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), CBDCs are centralized and fully backed by the issuing authority.

The primary goals of CBDCs vary by country — from improving cross-border payment efficiency to expanding financial inclusion and reducing the costs of handling cash.

Some also see CBDCs as tools for strengthening monetary sovereignty in an increasingly digital financial landscape.

CBDCs typically come in two forms:

The United Arab Emirates officially launched its Digital Dirham pilot  on Nov. 11, 2025, executing the country's first blockchain-based transaction through the central bank.

The Digital Dirham is a retail CBDC pegged 1:1 to the UAE dirham (AED), built to support faster, cheaper, and more secure financial transactions.

The pilot is being developed using mBridge, a multi-CBDC cross-border platform co-developed by the central banks of the UAE, China, Hong Kong, and Thailand.

According to the UAE Central Bank, the Digital Dirham will be gradually expanded into peer-to-peer, commercial, and cross-border use cases throughout 2026, with a full launch targeted for late 2026.

Officials have said the CBDC will help reduce remittance costs, a key economic driver in the Gulf, while improving transparency, security, and interoperability with other digital payment systems.

Despite the global rush, only four countries have successfully launched CBDCs with full retail functionality:

The Sand Dollar is the world's first retail CBDC, issued by the Central Bank of The Bahamas as a 1:1 digital representation of the Bahamian dollar (BSD), which is pegged to the U.S. dollar.

Its launch was driven by the Bahamas' high cash-handling costs and frequent hurricane disruptions to physical currency distribution.

By mid-2025, over 200,000 wallets will have been created in a population of 400,000 — yet circulation remains below 1% of the total currency issued.

The eNaira is Africa's first retail central bank digital currency, launched by the Central Bank of Nigeria as a 1:1 digital version of the Naira and built on the Hyperledger Besu blockchain.

Designed to expand access to financial services, the eNaira targets the country's large unbanked population, nearly 40% of adults, while addressing the high costs of remittances and restrictions on crypto use.

Users can access the eNaira through wallet apps that support peer-to-peer and merchant payments, offline transactions, and even smart contract-based remittance tools.

By October 2024, the eNaira had recorded more than 13 million wallets, a twelvefold increase since Nigeria's 2022 cash shortage, with ₦18.32 billion in transactions over the first ten months of the year.

Still, despite its impressive reach on paper, 98.5% of wallets were inactive on a weekly basis, according to the IMF.

Launched in 2022, JAM-DEX, short for Jamaica Digital Exchange, is the country's retail CBDC issued by the Bank of Jamaica.

It's pegged 1:1 to the Jamaican dollar (JMD) and operates on a centralized ledger.

The CBDC was introduced to modernize Jamaica's cash-heavy economy, where nearly 28% of adults remain unbanked.

It looks to make payments faster, cheaper, and more inclusive for everyday users and small merchants.

By March 2025, JAM-DEX circulation had reached J$258 million, with 230 million units minted since its launch.

Yet despite steady issuance, usage has remained modest — as of July 2024, only 257 million units were active, reflecting the broader challenge of driving CBDC adoption in a market still heavily reliant on cash.

ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, is the country's retail CBDC issued by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.

The token is backed by a basket of assets, including 40% gold reserves and U.S. dollars, making it one of the few hybrid-backed CBDCs in circulation.

Introduced in 2024, ZiG was designed to stabilize Zimbabwe's volatile currency system and restore confidence after years of inflation and currency devaluation.

By February 2025, ZiG accounted for 43% of formal-sector transactions, up from 26% at launch, and processed the equivalent of $480 million in pilot procurement activity.

However, challenges remain.

The informal economy, which dominates daily trade, still prefers the U.S. dollar, as ZiG has lost 94% of its value since launch, highlighting the difficulty of building trust in a digital currency amid persistent macroeconomic instability.

A further 49 countries are currently piloting CBDCs, testing everything from cross-border trade settlements to retail payments.

Among the most notable active pilots are:

Beyond these headline pilots, a diverse range of countries is conducting their own CBDC experiments.

Indonesia, Kazakhstan, the Philippines, and Russia are testing digital currencies for regional remittances and public-sector payments, while Sweden's e-Krona continues to explore how digital money could coexist with cash in advanced economies.

In Turkey, the Digital Lira is in limited testing across government procurement, and the United Arab Emirates' Digital Dirham pilot has already executed its first successful transaction.

Beyond active pilots, 72 countries are in the early or mid-stage of CBDC development.

These nations — including the U.K., Japan, Malaysia, Kenya, and Iran — are researching technological models, regulatory frameworks, and economic implications.

The United States remains the biggest outlier. Political opposition and privacy concerns have stalled the digital dollar initiative, even as the private stablecoin market flourishes.

Meanwhile, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan are pushing forward with digital currency experiments focusing on tokenized deposits and wholesale systems rather than fully public CBDCs.

The United Arab Emirates has made the first transaction with its central bank digital currency in the first major update to the project since it was announced in March.

The United Arab Emirates' Ministry of Finance and Dubai Finance said on Tuesday that the transaction was part of the pilot phase of the Digital Dirham project and used the government payment platform mBridge.

The agencies said the transaction was a first for the UAE government and was a “step towards broader adoption of the national digital currency across both government and private sector operations.”

It's the first major update on the CBDC since the UAE's central bank said in March that it expected the digital currency would begin its rollout in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Test transaction took under two minutes

Dubai Finance's executive director of central accounts, Ahmed Ali Meftah, said the transaction was conducted to “test operational readiness and ensure seamless technical integration with the Central Bank's systems.”

Rollout will be in phases

In a policy paper released in July, the UAE Central Bank said the CBDC is an attempt to future-proof central bank money for the digital era, and in response to the evolving needs of a digital economy.

Related: Italian banks back digital euro but urge ECB to spread out costs: Reuters

It also indicated that the rollout would be in phases, with the CBDCs features at launch limited to payments only, to avoid competing with savings and other interest-earning financial products.

CBDCs are a hotly debated issue, with critics concerned that they could infringe on privacy and undermine the financial sector by allowing users to be direct customers of central banks, while advocates argue that CBDCs could improve payment efficiency and expand financial inclusion.

Only three successfully launched CBDCs so far

Many governments have been experimenting with CBDCs. In October, Kyrgyzstan confirmed it plans to issue a central bank digital currency, while the European Central Bank decided to move to the next phase of its digital euro project.

However, only three CBDCs have officially launched, according to the American think tank, the Atlantic Council.

Its CBDC tracker lists Nigeria, the Bahamas and Jamaica as the only three jurisdictions with an active CBDC token, while another 49 countries are in the pilot phase.

Who would have predicted that one of the hottest trends for beleaguered biotechs in 2025 would be to rebrand as a crypto company?

Leap Therapeutics has became the latest drug developer to make the move, transforming this morning into Cypherpunk Technologies and focusing on its hoard of $50 million worth of a digital currency called ZEC.





Leap's original strategy of developing the anti-DKK1 antibody sirexatamab for a range of cancers appeared to grind to a halt in June, when the biotech laid off about three-quarters of its workforce in order to conserve its remaining cash.









At the time, Leap said it was “exploring strategic alternatives,” including a potential sale or partnership for both sirexatamab and FL-501, a GDF-15 neutralizing antibody in preclinical development for a wasting syndrome.

The biotech used that release to point to a “positive trend” for overall response rates in the phase 2 study of sirexatamab in colorectal cancer (CRC) but blamed “current market conditions” for having to wind down the clinical program.





By October, Leap's future was starting to take shape, with the promise of a $58 million private investment from Winklevoss Capital—a tech investor created by the Winklevoss brothers, who also co-founded the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini—to “initiate a digital asset treasury strategy.”

With Winklevoss' oversite, the idea is to “build long-term shareholder value through active participation in digital assets” while still using a “portion of the capital … to continue development of Leap's therapeutic programs, including FL-501 and sirexatamab.”

Leap clearly still had an eye on sirexatamab just this October. At that point, CEO Douglas Onsi pointed to the objective response rate of 38% for the drug in combination with Avastin in a phase 2 CRC study, saying targeting DKK1 “provides deep and durable benefit for patients in desperate need of new therapies.”

Onsi reaffirmed that Leap would use money from the Winklevoss financing “to engage with regulatory authorities over the registrational path for sirexatamab in CRC and to optimize the DKK1 biomarker diagnostic test that could be used to identify these CRC patients with poor prognosis.”

This morning's announcement of the rebrand to Cypherpunk does include a single reference to sirexatamab, but the focus is now very much on the ZEC coin, for which the company spent $50 million of the $58.8 million private placement.

Along with the rebrand—which will see the company's Nasdaq ticker switch from ""LPTX"" to ""CYPH""—digital market investor Khing Oei will replace Leap's Christopher Mirabelli, Ph.D., as chair of the company's board. Meanwhile, Will McEvoy, a principal at Winklevoss Capital, will step into the newly created role of chief investment officer.

“We are pleased to welcome Khing and Will to the board of directors, and to have Will serve as chief investment officer as we advance our strategy to create long-term shareholder value through active participation in Zcash,” Onsi said in the release.

“Participant control and privacy, enabled by Zcash, are critical as financial transactions move increasingly to blockchain and tokenization,” Onsi added. “The rebranding and new leadership appointments mark a transformational step in expanding our mission as we enter a new phase of growth.”

The pivot from bio to crypto may seem like a screeching handbrake turn, but Leap is not the first drug developer to make this transition.

September saw MEI Pharma—previously best known for its investigational leukemia drug—rebrand as Lite Strategy to reflect its decision to invest in more than $100 million worth of a cryptocurrency called Litecoin.

Meanwhile, Conduit Pharmaceuticals, Propanc Biopharma and MAIA Biotechnology have all looked into stockpiling various types of digital currencies in recent months.","{'href': 'https://www.fiercebiotech.com', 'title': 'Fierce Biotech'}","cryptocurrency"

That's according to a report Wednesday (Nov. 12) by Bloomberg News, which notes this move is part of a wider push by financial institutions to expand their digital asset business.

The token, which represents dollar deposits with the bank, lets users send and receive money using the Base blockchain, affiliated with Coinbase, Naveen Mallela, global co-head of J.P. Morgan's blockchain division Kinexys, told Bloomberg in an interview. 

This lets payments process within seconds and on a 24/7 basis, instead of days and confined solely to business hours.

The report says the launch follows a trial run of JPM Coin conducted in partnership with companies like Mastercard, Coinbase and B2C2. J.P. Morgan plans to eventually open the token to its own clients' customers and expand to other currency denominations and other blockchains, Mallela said. 

As Bloomberg notes, the launch is happening at a time when financial institutions such as Citigroup, Santander, Deutsche Bank and PayPal are experimenting more with digital assets. It comes in the wake of the GENIUS Act in the U.S. which regulates stablecoins, another increasingly popular type of digital currency.

As covered here last year, deposit tokens are digital representations of traditional bank deposits, issued by regulated financial institutions and backed 1-to-1 by fiat currency held in reserve. 

“Unlike cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or ethereum, which are decentralized and often subject to volatility, deposit tokens offer stability and reliability by ensuring each token corresponds to a specific amount of fiat currency,” PYMNTS wrote. “This backing by real-world assets provides a layer of trust and security that is necessary for widespread adoption.”

The main appeal of these tokens, that report added, comes from their stability. Each token is backed by fiat currency, giving them the same reliability as traditional bank deposits. This stability is critical for mainstream financial transactions and could help ease concerns about the volatility seen in cryptocurrencies.

And because deposit tokens are issued by regulated banks, they adhere to the same stringent regulatory frameworks as normal banking services. This compliance provides assurance that deposit tokens can be trusted by both consumers and businesses, addressing one of the obstacles to the wider adoption of digital currencies, PYMNTS wrote.

“We think that stablecoins get a lot of buzz, but for institutional clients, deposit-based products offer a compelling alternative,” Mallela told Bloomberg. “These can be yield-bearing.”

Oops, something went wrong

A Russian policymaker is calling on the Federal Assembly to regulate cryptocurrencies as a third of web traffic going into international crypto exchanges is seen to originate from Russia.

Yevgeny Masharov, a member of the Civic Chamber of the Commission for Public Review of Bills and Other Regulatory Acts, told RIA Novosti that the state must do more to police digital assets.

“We must launch legislation to regulate cryptocurrency circulation as soon as possible,” Masharov said. “All transactions outside [licensed platforms] need to be outlawed. We must introduce criminal liability for illegal cryptocurrency transactions.”

His call for stronger regulation comes as a combination of factors has driven Russians to adopt crypto.

“The combination of a weakening ruble, capital controls, and international sanctions has accelerated adoption,” Ari Redbord, the vice president and global head of policy and government affairs at the blockchain intelligence provider TRM Labs, told DL News. “This is both for legitimate financial access and, in some cases, for sanctions evasion.”

Redbord added that TRM's data “shows that the vast majority of Russian crypto activity remains lawful,” and that the increase reflects a broader global trend where more people are turning to digital assets due to “necessity, innovation, and financial pressure.”

Crypto is a thorny political issue in Russia.

As things stand, crypto exchanges are completely unregulated in Russia. The Central Bank has previously called for a complete, China-style ban on crypto trading.

But the Ministry of Finance would prefer to regulate the industry and force traders to pay tax on their profits. This has led to a lengthy stand-off.

Masharov said that crypto trading in Russia must now be restricted to regulated financial bodies, such as the Moscow Exchange and the country's largest banks.

Policymakers are concerned that the Telegram chat app, which is widely used in Russia, offers its users access to crypto wallet services.

This, Masharov said, allows all Russian citizens “to buy, sell, and invest digital currency directly from the app.”

And that removes these citizens' financial activities from the scrutiny of the country's regulators and anti-money laundering bodies, he warned.

Russian IP addresses accounted for up to 28% of traffic to the crypto exchange Bybit in October, according to data from the AI-powered digital intelligence provider Similarweb.

Bybit saw 17.5 million visits last month, 4.9 million of which originated from Russia, according to the data.

Russians also accounted for 16% of traffic to the HTX platform and 5% of Gate visitors. In total, at least 6 million Russians visited these overseas exchanges in October, RBC wrote.

Meanwhile, a survey from the financial marketplace operator Vyberu found that 10% of Russians want to invest in crypto, Russian media outlet Finansy reported.

Over a third of this group said they thought crypto could grant them “independence from the banking system or political risk.” And 30% said that the ability to trade crypto at any time, from anywhere in the world, drew them to coins.

But despite their confidence, only 3% to 5% of the survey's 2,500 respondents admitted to owning crypto.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","SoFi: How are US Banks Responding to the Crypto Wave?","https://fintechmagazine.com/news/sofi-how-are-us-banks-responding-to-the-crypto-wave","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 17:35:55 GMT","

SoFi Technologies has launched SoFi Crypto, positioning itself as the first nationally chartered bank in the US to offer consumers the ability to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies alongside traditional banking services.

The San Francisco-based fintech enables members to trade dozens of digital currencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana through a single integrated platform.

The phased rollout began this week and will expand to additional members over the coming weeks.

The launch allows SoFi members to purchase crypto assets directly from their FDIC-insured checking or savings accounts without transferring funds to separate platforms.

This integration eliminates the friction typically associated with moving between traditional banking and cryptocurrency exchanges.

""Today marks a pivotal moment when banking meets crypto in one app, on a trusted platform and driven by our core mission to help our members get their money right,"" comments Anthony Noto, CEO of SoFi.

Anthony emphasised the transformative potential of blockchain technology across financial services.

""I believe blockchain technology will fundamentally change EVERY way finance is done throughout the world by making money movement faster, cheaper and safer, while opening new ways for people to borrow better, invest better, spend and save better,"" he says.

The move follows SoFi's August partnership with blockchain platform Lightspark to enable crypto-powered international remittances with reduced fees and faster settlement times.

The company plans to leverage blockchain technology across its ecosystem, including the introduction of a USD stablecoin and integration of crypto into lending and infrastructure services.

SoFi has positioned the launch as addressing consumer demand for regulated crypto access, citing internal data showing 60% of its members who own cryptocurrency would prefer to manage their holdings through a licensed bank rather than standalone exchanges.

SoFi received its national bank charter in early 2022 through the acquisition of Golden Pacific Bancorp, allowing it to operate as a bank holding company.

The company had previously offered cryptocurrency trading but discontinued the service in late 2023 as a condition of receiving its banking licence during a period of heightened federal scrutiny of digital assets.

The relaunch follows new guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency under the current administration.

SoFi operates with 75 regulatory licences and emphasises bank-grade security, compliance standards and oversight by federal bank regulators as differentiators from standalone cryptocurrency exchanges.

The company's crypto offering includes in-app education and step-by-step guidance to address barriers to entry for consumers unfamiliar with digital assets.

Members can join a waitlist for priority access, with the company offering a promotional opportunity to receive one Bitcoin through qualifying account activities by January 2026.

The launch arrives during a period of rapid expansion in digital asset adoption, particularly in the stablecoin sector.

Boston Consulting Group reports the stablecoin market reached nearly US$270bn in August 2025, with business-to-business payments seeing a thirty-fold increase over two years.

US brokerage firm Bernstein forecasts stablecoin market capitalisation will expand 2.5 times through 2025, driven by cross-border transactions and institutional adoption.

The regulatory environment for digital assets has shifted significantly following changes in US policy, with the GENIUS Act providing clearer frameworks for stablecoin issuers and cryptocurrency services.

The best online casinos gain status through transparency and trustworthiness, calming the fears of prospective players. Online casinos that allow wagers with cryptocurrency face numerous similar challenges in comparison to apps and sites that offer online casino games for real money. Many of the fears relate to players' skepticism about cryptocurrency and a lack of information about how to identify a legitimate crypto casino.

Fear of the unknown can be strong. For many individuals, doubts regarding crypto casinos simply stem from a lack of experience and knowledge.

Those concerns can amplify when considering not only cryptocurrency itself but then adding in the gaming element. It's understandable to consider questions like whether you will actually collect your winnings if you get lucky playing on the casino site, for example.

However, many people voice similar concerns about licensed online casinos in the U.S. like Golden Nugget Casino. Although Golden Nugget and the ilk restrict currency usage to U.S. dollars, some people still hesitate to take advantage of the Golden Nugget Online Casino promo code due to security doubts. 

If doubts are steeped in a lack of information, then the upside is that information can quell those fears. Regarding crypto casinos, knowledge is power.

Click here to claim the Golden Nugget Casino promo code offer for new players:

If you hold cryptocurrency, it's natural to see a casino welcome bonus and be curious. These offers are also how legal sites like the BetMGM Casino app attract new players.

A first positive sign is the types of cryptocurrency accepted for play. If the site deals in Bitcoin and Ethereum, for example, you're on the right track.

A second consideration is the clarity and thoroughness of the casino site's policies for managing your crypto wallet. A lack of information or vague information in this regard is a red flag.

One of the most important points of evaluation is the casino's use of blockchain technology to provide transparency to game play. If you can't verify that, you're better off looking elsewhere to play.

Even if the website checks all these boxes, there is still risk involved any time you play casino games. In some ways, that risk elevates when you involve cryptocurrency.

Get your BetMGM Casino bonus code for new users now:

The value of your cryptocurrency can be highly volatile and a comparative lack of regulation compared to online casinos that run on US dollars means you are to some degree playing at your own risk without a high level of recourse to seek remedies from potential harms. The more research you do, the better suited you will be to avoid potential calamity.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is working toward a package of exemptions focused on offering crypto assets that are tied to investment contracts, said Chairman Paul Atkins.



""I have asked the staff to prepare recommendations for the commission's consideration that facilitate capital formation and accommodate innovation while, at the same time, ensuring investors are protected,"" Atkins said in remarks prepared for delivery Wednesday at a Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia event. ""By streamlining this process, innovators in the blockchain space can focus their energies on development and user engagement rather than navigating a maze of regulatory uncertainty.""



The long-standing debate over how to define whether digital assets are linked to investment contracts — a term of art defined by the Supreme Court in the so-called Howey Test — may get clarity beyond the previous administration's preference for handling the question through crypto enforcement actions.



Atkins underlined his view that even crypto assets linked to investment contracts may not always retain that status. ""Investment contracts can be performed and they can expire. They do not last forever simply because the object of an investment contract continues to trade on a blockchain,"" he said. It can cease when the issuer ""either fulfills the representations or promises, fails to satisfy them, or they otherwise terminate.""



Even if tokens are trading in association with investment contracts, Atkins argues that they should still be able to be handled through ""super apps"" from firms not necessarily registered with the SEC, such as those overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or state regulators.



""While capital formation should continue to be overseen by the SEC, we should not hamstring innovation and investor choice by requiring the underlying assets to trade in one regulated environment versus another,"" Atkins said.



In the speech, Atkins further outlined his views on what lies outside his agency's securities jurisdiction, including network tokens, digital collectibles and ""digital tools,"" such as memberships, tickets or identity badges. Tokenized securities, though, are definitely in the SEC's regulatory orbit, he said.



Meanwhile, he said his agency is still working with Congress to enact market structure legislation soon that will further codify his agency's crypto position.



""What I envision aligns with legislation currently being considered by Congress and aims to complement, not replace, Congress's critical work,"" he said. A new law will help protect the permanence of the policy shift, he argued. ""While the commission can provide a rational view under current law, there will always be risk that a future commission could reverse course.""



Atkins has spoken often in recent speeches about the limits on his agency's reach into crypto, which he called a ""commitment to humility.""

""Congress crafted the securities laws to address specific problems — situations in which people part with their money based on promises that depend on the honesty and the competence of others,"" he said. ""They were not designed as a universal charter to regulate every novel form of value, digital or otherwise.""

U.S. government agencies are cranking up the response to overseas scams that seek to trick people into sending crypto, with the Department of the Treasury announcing a Scam Center Strike Force on Wednesday even as it flagged its latest effort to target a Burmese operation that pursued Americans with fake investment schemes.



U.S. authorities, also including the Department of Justice, are standing up the strike force to go after so-called ""pig butchering"" often coordinated by massive organized-crime operations in places such as Burma, Cambodia, Laos and the Philippines. The newest case involved Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioning armed groups, companies and individuals in Burma associated with the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army and scam centers said to be backed by Chinese criminal organizations.



The strike force, led by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, aims to take apart the transnational criminal enterprises in Southeast Asia that have stolen tens of billions from Americans — much of it going unreported. The practice sees teams of operatives — often forced into it via human trafficking — working at a factory scale to trick people into fraudulent investing or into sending funds to fake romantic partners.



""The Administration will keep using every tool we have to go after these cybercriminals — wherever they operate — and to protect American families from their exploitation,"" said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John Hurley, in a statement.



The strike force envisions tapping various parts of the federal government with oversight duties related to this area, including DOJ, the Treasury Department, the State Department and domestic law enforcement agencies.



""The scale is staggering,"" said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs for TRM labs, of the global criminal enterprises involved in pig butchering. ""The DOJ's Scam Center Strike Force reflects a hard truth: no single agency can tackle this alone.""



In a similar vein, the DOJ has previously established a health care strike force and a trade-fraud task force.



Last month, U.S. authorities went after Prince Group, which was alleged to have run a Cambodia operation, with the DOJ taking what it said was its largest-ever seizure of 127,271 bitcoin BTC$101,696.11. The action was coordinated between the DOJ and the Treasury.



In Burma, the development of the scam centers was tied by the U.S. authorities to others among the sanctioned entities, including Trans Asia International Holding Group Thailand Company Ltd. (Trans Asia), Troth Star Co. Ltd. (Troth Star) and Thai national Chamu Sawang. The sanctions accused them of being linked to Chinese organized crime, and authorities said the proceeds are going toward funding Burma's civil war.

Bitcoin's Net Unrealized Profit (NUP) ratio is flashing a level that has historically marked short-term market bottoms, with the metric dropping to 0.476 this week to its lowest point since April.

The NUP measures the share of coins held in profit across the Bitcoin network by comparing current prices to each coin's last on-chain movement. A high reading suggests excess unrealized gains and a greater likelihood of profit-taking, while low readings point to capitulation, when most coins are near or below cost basis.

CryptoQuant data shows that this same 0.47-0.48 band triggered reversals three times since early 2024: once before Bitcoin's rally from $42,000 to $70,000 in February, again during the mid-2024 correction, and most recently before the October rebound to $110,000.

Each instance followed a wash-out in leverage and a decline in aggregate funding rates, making a dynamics that align with the current setup.

At present, bitcoin trades near $103,000 after slipping almost 10% over the past week.

If the pattern holds, the NUP reading below 0.5 could again mark a local bottom as selling pressure gives way to accumulation. In previous cycles, rebounds from this zone have averaged 15-25% over the following month, depending on liquidity conditions and macro sentiment.

While not a guarantee, the setup suggests a short-term relief move may be ahead — particularly if global risk appetite improves and U.S. yields stabilize. In that scenario, bitcoin could find support between $100,000 and $102,000 before attempting another leg higher.

U.S. President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Mike Selig, will face his Senate confirmation hearing on Nov. 19, 2025, as Washington edges closer to reshaping crypto oversight.

Selig, currently chief counsel of the SEC's Crypto Task Force, was formally tapped last month after Trump withdrew his earlier choice, former CFTC commissioner Brian Quintenz. 

CoinDesk reported in early October that Selig had become a frontrunner for the role. 

If confirmed, Selig would take over from acting chair Caroline Pham as lawmakers resume their push to finalize crypto market structure bill, which could grant the CFTC direct authority over spot trading in crypto.

The path forward still requires the Senate Agriculture Committee to hold a markup hearing for its bill as well as for the Senate Banking Committee to finalize and hold a markup hearing for its own version of the bill. Then the Senate would need to hold a floor vote on the combined effort, which if successful would send the bill to the House of Representatives for another vote, steps that could push the process into early 2026.

How AI Is Transforming the Grieving Process

Science writer David Berreby shares his personal journey with griefbots and discusses how they can offer unexpected comfort, insight and connection in the wake of loss.

Kendra Pierre-Louis: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Kendra Pierre-Louis, in for Rachel Feltman.

When someone we love dies we often yearn for the impossible: one more conversation. Maybe we want the opportunity to finally gain clarity about a difficult relationship or to say, “I love you” one last time to someone we cherish. While raising the dead is still out of reach more and more people are turning to generative AI tools such as Replika to conjure the essence of their loved ones and have those final conversations.

Some users claim these so-called griefbots have helped them process loss, but mental health experts are not so sure. Here to walk us through the story is science writer David Berreby, who authored an upcoming feature for Scientific American about the growing use of griefbots.

Thank you so much for joining us today, David.

David Berreby: I'm very happy to be here. Thanks for having me.

Pierre-Louis: It was really lovely reading your piece, and sort of one of the first questions that I thought was interesting is in the piece you don't just talk about people who have used, you know, what you call griefbots; you actually used one yourself. Can you walk us through a little bit of the process of what that entailed and how it felt?

Berreby: Well, I was really struck when I started to report on the piece that there were people who were sort of quick to condemn the entire idea of re-creating a deceased person in AI and, you know, predicting how just terrible it would be in a hundred different ways. And it seemed to me that most of the time the people who were saying, “This is a terrible use of AI,” had no actual experience with it. Whereas the people who had actually used one or therapists who were working with people who'd used them, they weren't saying, “This is great, and there's no problems,” but they were also not saying, “This is terrible.”

And so it seemed to me that it was one of those AI experiences, like so many others, that you just have to kind of experience for yourself to really understand, rather than just having a kind of a firsthand, knee-jerk reaction. So I thought, “Okay, let's see how it would work if I myself were to do this.”

Pierre-Louis: And I guess, kind of what does that actually entail?

Berreby: There are a lot of start-ups that offer to re-create a deceased person for you—their voice, even their look. And so those are some options that people have. You can also just wing it on your own with ChatGPT or another general LLM, large language model. But in all cases the process is pretty similar. You provide a certain amount of material for the AI to work with, either a voice sample, photos—if you're going with something that actually looks and sounds like the person—and certainly some text, some things that they wrote or some things that they said.

The data is never really enough because when you're trying to re-create someone who is important to you, you are re-creating something that is also about you. And so whatever service you use you also have to provide some description of the person that is not just data, things that they wrote, material in an archive but is your sort of take on them. In other words it's not enough to just say, “Here's a whole bunch of letters.” You have to say, “Well, you know, my dad was this kind of a person”: he had a sense of humor, or he really liked talking about fishing or whatever.

And so that is generally what's involved, no matter what service you're using. I actually tried three or four different ways to see what different results I would get. But that's the basic process.

Pierre-Louis: And fundamentally, what people are doing when they're uploading their loved one to these services is they're trying to navigate grief, right? And the thing that I found really surprising is how you described how grief works in our brain. I'm not sure I'd ever really read anything about that, that when we're grieving someone it's basically—our brains are in this tug-of-war between our neurochemistry that says, “This person is alive,” and the reality that this person is not. And that grief is essentially, like, a learning process of our brain learning that this person is gone, and that takes quite some time. How does AI affect that process, to the best of our current understanding?

Berreby: Well, that is where, I think, there's some continuity between uses of AI and other, more familiar processes of dealing with grief, because when you are in this really painful state of feeling like the person is still in your life and part of your life—and a very large proportion of people who've just lost some feel literally like, “Oh, they sent me a message. They're in touch with me. I sense them.” When you are in that state you will pick up an object that belonged to them or look at a photo or maybe listen to a recording or just conjure up a memory and then kind of relive a moment where they were around. And AI is essentially a new kind of artifact, I think, for doing the same thing. You're kind of re-creating some experience that you had with this person in this time when you're not quite believing that they're gone.

Of course, the difference with AI is that instead of having a conversation in your head imagining you talking to your loved one there's literally text on the screen or a voice in the air that is responding to you. So it's not, you know, exactly the same, but it's also not a giant break from the past. I mean, people have always re-created someone whom they miss, someone whom they long for, in one way or another, sort of imaginatively, right, in their minds. And so this is kind of a way of making it a little more literal, a little more in the world, but it's still that process.

Pierre-Louis: I know that one of the concerns was the risk of a lifelike interactive chatbot or griefbot is that it might make the path too attractive to let go, but the research seems to suggest, if I'm correct, that people who had recently lost someone and used griefbots actually experienced something [that was] a little bit of the opposite: instead of withdrawing from society they were more likely to be social. Why is that?

Berreby: Yeah, I think it's because, society doesn't like grief, you know? We're not a very death-aware society. We have people trying to literally become immortal. We don't really like talking about it. And so a lot of grieving people tell psychologists that they feel like there's a time limit or there's a constraint. Like, people are like, “Okay, I feel very bad for you, and now let's move on. I mean, I've given you, like, a half an hour,” or “You've had two weeks,” or a month or whatever. That's kind of painful for people because these things take the time they take; they're not really on a schedule.

So what the people in this small study that I write about were saying is, “This AI does not judge me, does not suggest that maybe I should talk about something else, does not tell me to move on. It just is there for me, and I can work through things with it at whatever pace is comfortable for me without feeling like I'm in any kind of conflict with another person, and then I feel better, and then I feel better about seeing people and not worse.”

Pierre-Louis: And that raised a question for me, which is, in some ways, your article really centered around kind of the concerns that people have for these griefbots, right? These people are coming out and saying, “These griefbots are serving a function that society is failing to provide for me.” What does that sort of say about our society?

Berreby: Yeah, I didn't have room to get into that in the piece. But that is an excellent question because I think you could argue that in a society that was really sort of psychologically well-balanced [laughs] it would be possible and understandable to be someone in deep grief and not have to be distressed by feeling that people were wanting you to just not talk about a such a downer subject or not say something that you said last week because they wanna, you know, get on with being productive and lively and all that other stuff that we seem to prefer, right?

So I agree with you. I think, you know, maybe you could argue that they're fulfilling a need that maybe we wouldn't have if we were a little less avoidant of the whole topic of loss and death after all.

Pierre-Louis: You end the piece somewhat cautiously optimistic about the future role of griefbots, which is sort of in, you know, standard juxtaposition to how much fearmongering we're getting these days about AI, and I was just kind of wondering, how did you land on that place, and what do you want our listeners to know kind of about that?

Berreby: You know, I didn't go in thinking I had a take on this. I mean, I think, you know, we all know millions and millions of people use kind of invented characters: “people,” in quotes, who don't exist, that the AI is reproducing. But the vast majority of those are made-up. You know, you go to Character.ai, you go to Replika, or you go elsewhere, and you say, “I want them to look like this and be like this and have this personality.”

And so these griefbots are a really interesting special case of that kind of creation because they're constrained. I mean, if you wanna make up a pretend grandma, you can. But if you wanna re-create yours, it has to be sort of constrained by the reality of your memories and the real person. And so, you know, that already kind of creates a different kind of relationship to the question of, like, “Oh, are these things too accommodating? Are they too sycophantic?” you know? Because if it's not like the real person, then it's not gonna really convince you of anything or make you have—feel anything.

So I, I guess I was mildly skeptical but open-minded, and then as I worked through my own experience and also read about what other people were saying, I realized that people are not stupid. You know, they don't text for 20 minutes with an AI that has sort of tried to re-create their grandfather and then suddenly get confused about, “Oh, is that a real ghost? Is he really out there?” Or, you know, “I'm not sure what's real anymore.” They know it's a—an artifact. They know it's something they're using to work something out with themselves.

And that was how I came to see it. I did—never thought, “That's my dad. You know, that's so eerie.” I just thought, “Oh, okay, there are these things that I was wondering about,” and bouncing them off this thing that has a flavor of him that I created with these thoughts in mind was kind of insight-provoking in a way that I wasn't sure it would be.

So it just seems to me that, you know, like anything else, I mean, you could define this as a therapeutic tool or as a kind of a thing for people to play with even, a creative tool, and that people can be okay with it, if it's packaged in the right way. That is to say, if, you know, it's something where you say, “Look, this is something you can use for yourself, for your creativity, to explore your feelings,” and not say, “Oh, we're gonna reproduce your loved one perfectly.” Not say, “We're gonna use the same social media engagement tactics that we use to keep you on Twitter and Facebook.” You know, it can be done right, and that's my cautious optimism. I'm not sure it will be, but it could be done right.

How to Identify a Prime Number without a Computer

For years, a French mathematician searched for a proof that a gigantic number is prime. His method is still used 150 years later

By Manon Bischoff edited by Daisy Yuhas

Is 170,141,183,460,469,231,731,687,303,715,884,105,727 prime? Before you ask the Internet for an answer, can you consider how you might answer that question without a computer or even a digital calculator?

In the 1800s French mathematician Édouard Lucas spent years proving that this 39-digit number was indeed prime. How did he do it? Lucas, who incidentally also designed the entertaining game Tower of Hanoi, developed a method that's still useful today, more than a century later.

People have been fascinated by prime numbers for millennia. These numbers are divisible only by 1 and themselves, whereas every other integer can be uniquely expressed as the product of several prime numbers; for example, 15 = 3 × 5. Prime numbers essentially form the periodic table of mathematics. They also hold many secrets. They appear on the number line with a certain regularity, but their occurrence is characterized by fluctuations that cannot yet be quantified. This unpredictability has been a source of consternation for experts.

And math enthusiasts are constantly seeking new prime numbers. The current record (as of October 2025) for the largest prime is 2136,279,841 − 1, a number with 41,024,320 digits. Simply reading this number aloud would take approximately 240 days.

Anyone who has observed the record-breaking prime numbers of recent years may have noticed that they mostly have a similar structure: 2p – 1 (where p is a prime number). Prime numbers of this form are called Mersenne primes. And the number to which Lucas dedicated almost two decades of his life is also a Mersenne prime, namely 2127 – 1. But there's some trickiness to these Mersenne primes: not every 2p– 1 is a prime number for every prime value of p. For example, 211 – 1 yields 2,047 and can be written as the product of 23 and 89.

So in the mid-19th century Lucas wondered whether 2127 – 1 was prime or not. He faced a formidable challenge. The number is enormous, consisting of 39 digits, and at that time Lucas obviously didn't have access to a computer. He had to manually ensure that 2127 – 1 had no divisors (except 1 and itself).

One way to accomplish this feat is to go through all prime numbers up to 2127 – 1 and make sure it does not divide by any of them. But this is extremely time-consuming and simply infeasible if you don't know all the smaller prime numbers.

Lucas didn't give up. He developed a novel method based on the findings of his colleague Évariste Galois that required significantly less computation.

Before we delve into the beautiful—but admittedly abstract—mathematics of Galois and Lucas, I'll present Lucas's result, now known as the Lucas-Lehmer primality test.

To check whether 2p – 1 is prime, Lucas developed the following algorithm:

Create a sequence of numbers whose first term is s0 = 4 and where each subsequent sn is calculated as s2n – 1 – 2. The sequence is therefore: 4, 14, 194, 37,634, and so on.

Then 2p – 1 is a prime number if and only if the p – 2nd term of the sequence (that is, sp – 2) is divisible by 2p – 1 without a remainder. That is to say, every Mersenne prime has this property, and conversely, every sp – 2 defines a Mersenne prime 2p – 1.

So instead of dividing the Mersenne number by all prime numbers less than 2127 – 1, it suffices to perform calculations to determine s125 and then divide by 2127 – 1. That's much simpler, right?

In practice, there's just one tiny—or rather, very big—problem. The sequence terms sn grow extremely fast—so fast, in fact, that it's not particularly practical to work with them. Therefore, experts resort to a trick: they divide the sequence terms sn by the Mersenne number and continue with the remainder if the division doesn't result in a whole number. This doesn't change the second part of the algorithm, so the condition for Mersenne primes remains the same: they must be able to evenly divide sp – 2. This trick does make sp – 2 significantly smaller, however.

To better understand the primality test, we can work through it using a simple example: the Mersenne number 2⁵ – 1, which is 31. Using the algorithm developed by Lucas, we need to calculate s3, which is 37,634. Dividing this number by 31 gives us the exact result 1,214. This means that s3 is divisible by 25 – 1, and therefore, the latter is a prime number.

After years of painstaking work, Lucas developed this primality test and applied it to 2127 – 1. He was thus able to show that it was indeed a prime number. To this day, it remains the largest prime number found without the aid of a computer.

Lucas did not conclusively prove that his method reliably identified Mersenne primes, however. This was only achieved by mathematician Derrick Henry Lehmer in 1930, which is why the method is known as the Lucas-Lehmer primality test.

But why does this strategy work at all? In fact, the proof is quite technical—and therefore, I'll spare you the details (available on Wikipedia). But I can roughly outline the idea behind the method.

The Lucas-Lehmer primality test is based on the research of Galois, who investigated symmetries in various mathematical objects at the beginning of the 19th century. Unlike his predecessors, however, he did not limit himself to geometric figures but also considered the symmetries of equations or number fields. The latter term describes a set of numbers in which all four basic arithmetic operations (that is, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) can be applied without leaving the set. In other words, if I add or divide two numbers from the set, I get a number that is also part of the set. Examples of number sets are the rational numbers (which include integers and fractions) or the real numbers.

But it turns out that there are smaller number sets containing only a finite number of integers from 0 to p – 1. To preserve the properties of a set, the numbers must be continued periodically; after p – 1, 0 follows again: (0, 1, 2, 3, ..., p – 1, 0, 1, 2, ...). Such so-called finite fields may seem strange, but in fact, we encounter them in daily life: on an analog clock, it is perfectly natural that 1 follows 12.

As it turns out, finite number systems are a field if and only if p is a prime number. And Galois discovered that these finite number fields possess special symmetric properties. Lucas exploited this principle in developing his primality test: If 2127 – 1 is a prime number, then the corresponding number field 0, 1, 2,..., 2127 – 2 must possess certain symmetrical properties. To generate this finite number system, you must divide all values greater than 2127 – 1 by 2127 – 1 and calculate the remainder. This is the final step in Lucas's algorithm.

Scientists identified a gene in the amygdala that can cause anxiety by over-expressing itself. They treated that gene in mice and saw an instant change.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Anxiety plagues hundreds of millions of people, including over 40 million adults and 4 million children in the U.S. alone. Some psychologists even see it as an epidemic. Dystopian headlines in the news, not to mention the doomscrolling sessions they breed, already seem like enough to trigger near-apocalyptic levels of anxiety, but (dumpster fires and social media aside) its origins were uncertain—until now. 

There was previously some idea about which part of the brain that anxious feeling crawled out of. Overactivation of the amygdala, which processes emotional stimuli, switches on an inflammatory response when faced with stress. Inflammation is at least partly behind conditions that involve anxiety and depression (common comorbidities). Stress is also often a contributing factor, which can lead to the dysfunction of neurotransmitters like serotonin and epinephrine (antidepressants can help treat this dysfunction by raising neurotransmitter levels). But something was still missing from the picture.

Neuroscientist Juan Lerma, from the Institute for Neurosciences in San Juan de Alicante, Spain, investigated further. He and his research team found that over-expression of one gene can stress the amygdala and put the brain on edge. The Grik4 gene encodes a protein in the central nervous system that functions as a neurotransmitter and excites neurons. Butut this can cross the threshold to neural overexcitement. Lerma wanted to see what would happen if he targeted specific neurons in the amygdalas of mice that had been genetically modified with extra copies of Grik4.



“The amygdala, particularly its hyperactivity, is strongly implicated in anxiety,” he said in a study recently published in the journal iScience. “Mice overexpressing the Grik4 gene display anxiety, depression, social deficits, and disrupted amygdala excitability.”

Lerma gave the mice injections that balanced Grik4 levels in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala. Previous studies have suggested that this region helps with overcoming stress by regulating how the brain learns after a stressful experience. Neurons in the basolateral nucleus are what are called pyramidal neurons, which increase neural activity and are important for many cognitive functions, including consciousness and memory. The researchers focused on these neurons because of their potential to become overexcited. 

Grik4 is expressed throughout the amygdala, and if expression spikes in basolateral amygdala neurons, it can affect communication with neurons in the central amygdala—especially a group in the centrolateral amygdala, which are responsible for firing nerve impulses. These messages travel through the neuron, releasing a neurotransmitter at the synapse, where it is transferred to the end of the next neuron (this is how neurons communicate). Lowering Grik4 levels normalized communication between neural groups in the basolateral and centrolateral amygdala.

Levels of anxiety, depression, and social interaction were measured in the mice using behavioral tests and electrophysiological recordings. Before the mice with excess Grik4 were treated, they preferred closed spaces away from other mice and showed no interest in socializing with mice they had not been introduced to before. Adjusting Grik4 levels allowed neurons to communicate properly and reversed symptoms of anxiety and social withdrawal. Both the genetically modified lab mice and wild mice already prone to anxiety showed positive results after treatment.

“The identification of such a critical role for a small population of neurons in the [centrolateral] amygdala circuitry with specific firing properties pinpoints how subtle changes in input strength may be enough to reversibly distort circuit activity and provides a new target for the therapy of affective disorders,” Lerma said.

Further research will look at how other parts of the brain, such as the hippocampus, may be involved in conditions that produce or contribute to high anxiety. Opportunities for human research might arise in the future, but until then, some deep breathing exercises can help.

An international group of scientists has confirmed the discovery of three Earth-sized planets within the binary stellar system known as TOI-2267, located roughly 190 light-years from Earth. The finding, published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, offers new insight into how planets can form and remain stable in double-star systems, which were once thought too chaotic for complex planetary development.

""Our analysis shows a unique planetary arrangement: two planets are transiting one star, and the third is transiting its companion star,"" explains Sebastián Zúñiga-Fernández, a researcher at the University of Liège (ULiège) and first author of the paper. ""This makes TOI-2267 the first binary system known to host transiting planets around both of its stars.""

A Compact and Unusual Double-Star System

TOI-2267 consists of two stars locked in a close orbital dance, forming what astronomers call a compact binary system. Such systems create gravitational forces that typically disrupt planet formation. Despite this, researchers have detected three Earth-sized planets in tight orbits, a surprising outcome that challenges long-held theories about where rocky worlds can exist.

""Our discovery breaks several records, as it is the most compact and coldest pair of stars with planets known, and it is also the first in which planets have been recorded transiting around both components,"" says Francisco J. Pozuelos, a co-leader of the study and researcher at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (IAA-CSIC).

Combining Space and Ground Observations

NASA's TESS space telescope first provided the data leading to this discovery. Two of the planets were initially identified by astronomers at ULiège and IAA-CSIC using their custom software tool, SHERLOCK. This early detection prompted ground-based observations to confirm the findings.

The confirmation process required a major effort involving several observatories. Among the most important were the SPECULOOS and TRAPPIST telescopes operated by ULiège (PI: Michaël Gillon). Designed to detect small exoplanets around cool, dim stars, these robotic instruments were vital for verifying the planets and studying their characteristics in detail.

A Natural Testbed for Planet Formation

""Discovering three Earth-sized planets in such a compact binary system is a unique opportunity,"" says Zúñiga-Fernández. ""It allows us to test the limits of planet formation models in complex environments and to better understand the diversity of possible planetary architectures in our galaxy.""

Pozuelos adds, ""This system is a true natural laboratory for understanding how rocky planets can emerge and survive under extreme dynamical conditions, where we previously thought their stability would be compromised.""

Looking Ahead to Future Exploration

The discovery opens up new questions about how planets form and persist in binary systems. Upcoming observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and next-generation ground-based observatories could reveal more details, such as the planets' masses, densities, and even their atmospheric compositions.

Beyond its scientific importance, the finding underscores the value of combining data from space-based observatories like TESS with precise ground-based instruments such as SPECULOOS and TRAPPIST. Together, they continue to expand our understanding of how planetary systems form and evolve across the galaxy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Wegovy and Ozempic tied to dramatically lower cancer deaths","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251112011810.htm","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 13:01:14 GMT","

A new study from the University of California San Diego suggests that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, a class of medications originally developed for type 2 diabetes, may have benefits that extend far beyond blood sugar and weight management. These drugs, which include semaglutide (sold as Ozempic and Wegovy) and tirzepatide (known as Mounjaro), are already well known for helping people lose weight and manage metabolic conditions. Now, researchers have discovered that they might also be linked to better survival outcomes in colon cancer patients.

The study analyzed medical records from more than 6,800 people diagnosed with colon cancer across University of California Health facilities. Patients who were taking GLP-1 medications were less than half as likely to die within five years compared to those not using the drugs (15.5% versus 37.1%). This striking difference points to a potentially powerful new use for drugs that are already transforming diabetes and obesity treatment.

The research was led by Raphael Cuomo, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and a member of the UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center. His team used the University of California Health Data Warehouse to review outcomes across the state's academic medical centers.

After accounting for important factors such as age, body mass index (BMI), cancer severity, and other health conditions, the team found that people taking GLP-1 drugs still had a significantly lower risk of death. This consistency suggests the protective benefit of GLP-1 therapy may be independent of other medical or lifestyle variables.

Why GLP-1 Drugs Might Protect Against Cancer

The benefit appeared strongest in patients with obesity (BMI over 35). This finding hints that GLP-1 drugs may help offset some of the inflammation and metabolic stress that can make cancer harder to treat.

Scientists are exploring several possible explanations for this effect. GLP-1 receptor agonists are known to lower inflammation throughout the body, enhance insulin sensitivity, and promote weight loss -- all factors that can influence cancer growth and progression. Experimental studies in laboratories also indicate that GLP-1 drugs may directly inhibit the growth of tumor cells, encourage cancer cell death, and alter the surrounding environment within tumors to make them less supportive of disease spread.

However, researchers caution that it is still unclear whether the lower death rate seen in this study reflects a direct anti-cancer action or an indirect result of improved overall metabolic health.

Next Steps: Clinical Trials Needed

Dr. Cuomo emphasized that the findings are observational, meaning they do not yet prove that GLP-1 drugs directly improve cancer outcomes. These results highlight an urgent need for clinical trials to test whether GLP-1 medications can actually enhance cancer survival, particularly among patients with obesity-related cancers.

The study was published in Cancer Investigation on November 11, 2025.

Weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Mounjaro deliver impressive heart protection for people with type 2 diabetes.

GLP-1 Drugs Linked to Better Heart Health

Injectable medications used for weight loss may also lower the risk of major cardiovascular problems in people with type 2 diabetes. Researchers from the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and Harvard Medical School reached this conclusion after analyzing insurance claims data. Their findings show that semaglutide and tirzepatide (sold as Ozempic and Mounjaro) can reduce the risk of serious heart-related events by as much as 18 percent.

The research, published in Nature Medicine, drew on a vast collection of data from U.S. health insurance records. ""Those data are collected in routine clinical care and can be used for research. They allow us to answer a broad range of relevant questions efficiently. Importantly, we are studying patients who reflect everyday clinical practice -- unlike the highly selected participants typically enrolled in randomized trials,"" explains Dr. Nils Krüger, the study's lead author and a physician at the Department of Cardiovascular Diseases at the TUM University Hospital German Heart Center.

Heart Protection Beyond Weight Loss

The results clearly indicate that these newer diabetes treatments help protect the heart in people with elevated cardiovascular risk. Compared with sitagliptin, a diabetes medication known to provide no measurable heart benefits, semaglutide cut the risk of stroke and heart attack by 18 percent. Tirzepatide lowered the combined risk of stroke, heart attack, and death by 13 percent compared with dulaglutide, an older GLP-1 drug already in use.

""Both substances have a cardioprotective effect. Our data show that the benefits emerge from early on, indicating that the effect goes beyond weight loss alone,"" says Dr. Krüger. However, researchers note that the biological mechanisms behind this protective effect remain uncertain.

Because semaglutide and tirzepatide are relatively new, studies directly examining their cardiovascular effects have been limited, especially those comparing the two drugs head-to-head. The research team from TUM, Harvard Medical School, and Brigham and Women's Hospital aimed to fill this knowledge gap to guide better treatment decisions for patients at risk of heart disease.

Comparing Ozempic and Mounjaro

""According to the manufacturers' claims, each one suggests its own product is more effective than the competitor's at reducing cardiovascular risk,"" says Prof. Heribert Schunkert, Director of the Department of Cardiovascular Diseases at TUM University Hospital. ""Our study, however, shows only small differences in heart outcomes between tirzepatide and semaglutide in the risk groups we analyzed.""

Dr. Krüger adds: ""We hope our findings will provide clarity to physicians about how these new medications perform in clinical practice. Our transparent study design is also intended to support open scientific discussion about whether and how modern GLP-1 drugs should become part of the standard therapeutic repertoire in cardiovascular medicine.""

Recently, Dr. Krüger's team was able to show that treatment with semaglutide or tirzepatide can reduce health risks for people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction by over 40 percent. The study has been published in the journal JAMA (PMID: 40886075). 

This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health (R01-HL141505, R01-AR080194) and the German Heart Foundation (S/02/24, SRF-HF/24, RWE/11/25).

Chinese scientists have become the first to visit one of Earth's most remote and geologically intriguing realms: an underwater volcanic ridge in the Arctic Ocean.

The expedition, which concluded late last month, explored the eastern part of the Gakkel ridge — part of the global system of submerged mountain chains that play a key part in plate tectonics. A team of scientists took a submersible vessel beneath the Arctic sea ice and completed more than 40 dives, going as deep as 5,277 metres.

The analyses are far from complete, but this section of the Gakkel ridge might have hot-water vents that spew from the sea floor. Similar vents on the western, and better-explored, part of the ridge are home to bizarre ecosystems that thrive far from the reach of sunlight. They provide scientists with some of the best opportunities to understand how life might arise and evolve in icy oceans on worlds beyond Earth, such as on Jupiter's ice-encrusted moon Europa.

Expedition scientists will spend the next few years studying the rocks, water and animals that they gathered during the submersible dives. “It's the last piece of the puzzle” to understanding this unique Arctic environment, says Xiaoxia Huang, a marine geophysicist at the Institute of Deep-Sea Science and Engineering in Sanya, China, and the expedition's chief scientist.

The Gakkel ridge stretches from off the coast of Greenland to Siberia. Volcanic eruptions along it create new sea-floor crust, which spreads away from the ridge at some of the slowest rates on the planet — slower than the rate at which fingernails grow. Yet, somehow that sluggish geology manages to produce enough heat and chemical energy to sustain hydrothermal vents on the sea floor.

In 2001, a US–German expedition discovered hydrothermal vents on the western part of the Gakkel ridge1. Researchers have returned multiple times to that area to study the rich chemistry and biology of the deep, dark vent system2,3.

But the eastern side of the ridge is more remote and challenging to explore. Russian scientists have conducted some surveys, but the latest Chinese expedition is the first intensive geological survey and diving expedition in the area, Huang says.

“It's so hard to get there that anything anybody does is almost guaranteed to be exciting and different and new,” says Christopher German, a marine geochemist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. “The Chinese expedition is poised to yield significant new insights,” adds Elmar Albers, a marine geoscientist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany. 

The Chinese expedition, organized by the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, paired a deep-sea crewed submersible, named Fendouzhe, with an ice-breaker. It was the first time Fendouzhe, which has explored many parts of the oceans including the Mariana Trench, has visited the Arctic region. Other expeditions have used remotely operated vehicles to explore the Gakkel Ridge, because of the dangers of the vehicle becoming trapped under floating sea ice.

A long-standing goal of artificial intelligence is to build systems capable of complex reasoning in vast domains, a task epitomized by mathematics with its boundless concepts and demand for rigorous proof. Recent AI systems, often reliant on human data, typically lack the formal verification necessary to guarantee correctness. By contrast, formal languages such as Lean1 offer an interactive environment that grounds reasoning, and reinforcement learning (RL) provides a mechanism for learning in such environments. We present AlphaProof, an AlphaZero-inspired2 agent that learns to find formal proofs through RL by training on millions of auto-formalized problems. For the most difficult problems, it uses Test-Time RL, a method of generating and learning from millions of related problem variants at inference time to enable deep, problem-specific adaptation. AlphaProof substantially improves state-of-the-art results on historical mathematics competition problems. At the 2024 IMO competition, our AI system, with AlphaProof as its core reasoning engine, solved three out of the five non-geometry problems, including the competition's most difficult problem. Combined with AlphaGeometry 23, this performance, achieved with multi-day computation, resulted in reaching a score equivalent to that of a silver medallist, marking the first time an AI system achieved any medal-level performance. Our work demonstrates that learning at scale from grounded experience produces agents with complex mathematical reasoning strategies, paving the way for a reliable AI tool in complex mathematical problem-solving.

Dark excitons in atomically thin van der Waals materials provide an exciting platform for information transport and nanophotonic applications. Although dark excitons are difficult to access through free-space radiation, hybrid heterostructures incorporating plasmonic nanocavities provide a powerful platform to tailor their interactions with photons. Here we design a heterostructure consisting of optimized plasmonic nanocubes coupled to a WSe2 monolayer encapsulated between thin hexagonal boron nitride layers to unveil a new family of dark excitons. The emission from these dark excitons is 2,700 times stronger than bright excitons, yielding a striking enhancement factor of 3 × 105. We demonstrate the spin-forbidden nature of these dark states by studying their magneto-optical response. Furthermore, we selectively activate them by controlling the Fermi level via electric doping. Prominent features of these dark excitons include narrow linewidths, long lifetime, efficient electrical and magnetic modulation. Our findings unlock the potential for exploring exciton physics in two-dimensional materials using photonic heterostructures that preserve the intrinsic optical properties of two-dimensional materials in the coupling process. The demonstrated on-site control and ease of integration with passive photonic components make this platform particularly compelling for nanophotonic and sensing applications.

The rules for the 2025 version of the influential Highly Cited Researchers list exclude scientists whose co-authors have engaged in practices such as a tendency to cite their own papers. Credit: Getty

The creators of an influential list of highly cited researchers have shaken up their methodology this year, taking a swipe at scientists who associate with those linked to possible ethical breaches. The new rules have allowed the field of mathematics to return to the list, after being excluded for the past two years owing to concerns over suspicious citation patterns.

The Highly Cited Researchers (HCR) list is produced by the multinational data-analytics company Clarivate, which also owns the Web of Science database. The list aims to recognize contemporary researchers with “significant and broad influence”, who are among the authors of papers that are in the top 1% in their field by number of citations. The programme recognizes thousands of individuals each year across 21 natural- and social-science fields and factors into influential rankings of universities.

Thousands of highly cited scientists have at least one retraction

Thousands of highly cited scientists have at least one retraction

This year, the list was compiled with a new step: exclusion of any papers with an author who had been knocked off the previous year's HCR list owing to research-integrity issues. This means that anyone who routinely co-authored papers with someone who'd been excluded in the previous year was less likely to be acknowledged than before the change.

“It's quite a good idea. It's a big cleaning,” says Lauranne Chaignon, a bibliometrician at PSL University in Paris, who has studied the HCR list1. There is, she adds, a small chance of removing a deserving scientist.

This year's list, announced today, recognizes 6,868 people.

Starting around 2016, HCR organizers noticed a rise in suspicious activity in the data used to compile the list, says David Pendlebury, head of research analysis at Clarivate's Institute for Scientific Information (ISI). The issue became most pronounced in maths: a few people were publishing large numbers of papers, especially in the field of fractional differential equations. These authors frequently cited each other, causing others to fall off the HCR list. “A lot of these people were not known to us, and they were from institutions sometimes we'd never heard of,” says Pendlebury. “The world-famous mathematicians that we originally were seeing were disappearing.”

Maths is particularly vulnerable to gaming because its metrics are small: mathematicians tend to publish fewer papers with fewer co-authors and citations than do academics in other fields2. “Just a few more citations into the system is quite disruptive,” says Pendlebury. As a result, Clarivate chose to omit the field entirely from the 2023 and 2024 lists.

The process of constructing the HCR list starts with a ‘long list' of about 200,000 papers and reviews that are in the top 1% in their field by citation count. The ISI team then whittles this down by removing retracted papers and those with more than 30 authors (on which it's hard to determine individual contributions), for example.

Social-media trends are encouraging people to consume more protein than most official guidelines recommend. Credit: Akos Stiller/Bloomberg/Getty

Snack bars, yogurts, ice cream, even bottled water: it seems like food makers have worked out ways to slip extra protein into just about anything as they seek to capitalize on a growing consumer trend.

Today, protein-fortified foods and protein supplements form a market worth tens of billions of US dollars, with fitness influencers, as well as some researchers and physicians, promoting high-protein diets as the secret to strength and longevity. Protein is undeniably essential, but how much people really need is still a topic of debate.

What humanity should eat to stay healthy and save the planet

What humanity should eat to stay healthy and save the planet

On the one hand, most official guidelines recommend a minimum of close to one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, or the equivalent of about 250 grams of cooked chicken (which contains around 68 g of protein) for an adult weighing 70 kilograms. On the other hand, a growing narrative in wellness circles encourages people to eat more than double that amount. Many scientists fall somewhere in the middle and take issue with some of the advice circulating online.

“It's really frustrating because there isn't evidence to support the claims that they're making,” says Katherine Black, an exercise nutritionist at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, referring to the super-high protein recommendations often shared on social media. What research does show is that protein needs can vary from person to person and can change throughout a lifetime. And people should think carefully about what they eat to meet those needs. “On social media, it's like everyone's worried about protein, putting protein powder into everything,” she says.

Health authorities can help to guide people's dietary choices on the basis of the latest research. The next Dietary Guidelines for Americans, a document that advises on what to eat for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, is due to come out by the end of this year. But its recommendations, which have tended to be broadly influential, might be changing.

Researchers have been trying to estimate how much protein people need for more than a century. In 1840, chemist Justus von Liebig estimated that the average adult required 120 grams of protein a day, on the basis of a group of German workers' diets. Later, scientists started to use nitrogen to calculate protein requirements. Protein is the only major dietary component that contains nitrogen. So, by measuring how much of it people consume and the amount they excrete, researchers could estimate how much the body uses.

Since the 1940s, this nitrogen-balance method has been used to determine the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), a set of nutrient recommendations developed by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

Are ultra-processed foods really so unhealthy? What the science says

The latest such recommendation for protein, from 2005, establishes the RDA for both men and women at 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight per day, which it states should be enough to meet the needs of 97–98% of healthy people. European and global-health authorities recommend similar or slightly higher levels.

Although scientists recognize that RDAs are a useful reference point, many say that people could benefit from a higher amount. “The RDA is not a target; it's simply the minimum that appears to prevent any detectable deficiency,” says Donald Layman, a researcher focusing on protein requirements at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign. Evidence suggests1 that the optimal range is between 1.2 and 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, he says.

That is especially true for older adults, who often experience muscle loss as they age, as well as for certain athletes and people trying to gain muscle.

For example, in an observational study of 2,066 adults aged 70–79, those who reported eating the most protein — about 1.1 gram per kilogram of bodyweight — lost 40% less lean mass during the three years of follow-up than did those who ate the least — around 0.7 grams per kilogram2.

“For older adults, 1.2 grams per kilogram is just giving them a little extra protection,” says Nicholas Burd, a nutrition and exercise researcher also at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign. Furthermore, older people might experience a decline in appetite, which makes it particularly important for them to pay attention to their protein intake. It doesn't mean that they need to take protein supplements, he says. “It's all things we can do with just normal incorporation of high-protein foods in our lives.”

Fasting for weight loss is all the rage: what are the health benefits?

Fasting for weight loss is all the rage: what are the health benefits?

For healthy adults, increasing protein can boost the effects of resistance exercise, such as weightlifting. A 2017 systematic review found that, among people engaged in this type of training, taking protein supplements enhanced muscle gain and strength3. But increasing protein beyond 1.6 grams per kilogram per day provided no further benefit.

Meanwhile, some fitness influencers swear by eating 2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight. For most people, that's simply overkill, says Burd. There's little harm, other than for people with kidney disease, but Burd adds: “You just create an inefficient system where your body gets very good at wasting food protein.”

Some practitioners might recommend higher protein targets to ensure that people get enough, Burd says. But the protein craze has been driven mostly by aggressive marketing of high-protein foods and supplements, he says.

“The myth of increased protein needs has seeped into popular imagination, including among health professionals, and has been conveniently reinforced by the food industry,” says Fernanda Marrocos, a researcher specializing in nutrition and food policy at the University of São Paulo in Brazil.

Geopolitical tensions are affecting international collaborations in key areas of research, including the semiconductor sector.Credit: Rebecca Bailey/AFP via Getty

Data indicate that geopolitical tensions are affecting how scientists around the world collaborate on research projects. But “rather than uniformly shrinking, global academic networks are being reconfigured”, says Marina Zhang, a technology and geopolitics researcher at the University of Technology Sydney, in Australia. Collaborations with Israel and Russia, and between China and the United States, are among those seeing such shifts.

Scientific collaborations between Israeli researchers and academics in other countries have declined this year, following the war in Gaza, which began in October 2023 after Hamas attacks on Israel. The analysis, by Science|Business, a network of universities, companies and research and policy organizations, looked at patterns of co-authorship in preprints indexed in the Scopus database.

Countries whose governments have been particularly critical of the Gaza war showed the biggest drops in collaborations with Israel. The percentage of all Israeli preprints that were co-authored with scientists in Spain fell from 9.2% in 2024 to 5.9% this year. Similarly, the proportion of Israeli preprints with South African co-authors declined from 3.4% in 2024 to just 1% this year (see ‘Research collaborations with Israel').

Some researchers who spoke to Nature say the data are an early indication that individual academics are boycotting Israeli science because of the war in Gaza. “This is a way of putting pressure on Israel,” says Giacomo Ortona, a nuclear physicist at Italy's National Institute for Nuclear Physics in Turin. In September, Ortona was involved in a petition calling on CERN — Europe's particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland — to suspend cooperation with Israel.

David Lehrer, director of the Centre for Applied Environmental Diplomacy at the Arava Institute, in Ketura, Israel, says the boycotts are having an impact on Israeli science. “We have recently encountered European countries such as Spain whose research institutes refuse to work with any Israeli research institute in applying for EU grants,” says Lehrer.

But Anat Paz, spokesperson for The Association of University Heads in Israel (VERA) says the data do not provide a full picture and that it is “too early to draw a conclusion” regarding the trend of collaborations involving Israeli universities. “We will have a much clearer picture once the complete data for 2025 has been compiled and reviewed early next year,” Paz adds.

In May 2024, VERA published a press release in response to a statement made by the Conference of Rectors of Spanish Universities (CRUE) expressing regret about the situation in Gaza, saying the association wishes to correct misunderstanding which “presupposes the possibility that Israeli academic institutions are not dedicated to peace and to international humanitarian law. [We] too mourn the loss of innocent life in this horrific conflict and want a better future for Palestinians and Israelis both. However, academic boycotts are dangerous and may very well cause more harm than good,” they wrote in the press release.

Indications of drop in collaborations between Israel and international research partners is part of a broader geopolitical story. A similar decline in global collaboration was seen with Russia following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Unlike individual scientists boycotting Israeli research, the decline in partnerships with Russia involves top-down policy statements from governments, most notably in the US, “to reduce or eliminate scientific work with Russia,” says Caroline Wagner, a science policy researcher at Ohio State University in Columbus.

An analysis by Nature in 2023 found research collaborations between Russia and Western institutions had dropped a year into its war on Ukraine. Some funders of these institutions and the Ukrainian government discouraged the co-authoring of papers with Russian researchers. This decline was not seen for China and India, whose collaborations with Russia increased the same year.

A separate analysis published in August this year by VoxUkraine, an independent analytical platform based in Kyiv, found that global publications with Russian co-authors dropped by 26% between 2021 and 2024. These papers were also cited less — with an 89% drop in the number of citations these papers received in 2024 compared to 2021 (see ‘Sharp fall in citations with Russian papers).

These “formal restrictions” have changed research collaborations with Russia. “Sanctions, funding cuts, brain drain, and tighter state control have deepened the decline since 2022”, says Zhang.

Declining rates of collaborations with individual countries like Russia and Israel are part of a wide-ranging reconfiguration of global academic networks, says Zhang.

Political tensions between the China and the US have also affected collaborations between the two countries. China still remains the top partner of the US, and Chinese scientists are increasingly lead joint projects with the UK, US and Europe, but the number of Chinese research papers with American co-authors dropped by 6.4% between 2017 and 2023.

University reputations and finances often hinge on their position in global ranking tables. Students use rankings to quickly identify the best place to study — or, at least, what might be perceived to be the best by any future employer. Even a small shift in rank can affect how many students apply to a university, altering the income from tuition fees (R.-D. Baltaru et al. Stud. High. Educ. 47, 2323–2335; 2022).

The future of universities

The future of universities

And governments love the simplicity of rankings. Many will fund their citizens' overseas study only at institutions that are high up the listings. National investment initiatives — such as Russia's 5-100 Academic Excellence project and Japan's Top Global University project — often focus on universities that have a chance of making it into the upper echelons of the rankings. The UK government offers its High Potential Individual visas only to candidates who have studied at highly ranked universities.

Such reliance on rankings means that universities are shaped not by the needs of society or by innovations driven from inside the international higher-education community, but by unappointed third-party ranking agencies.

The indicators used by some of the dominant flagship rankings don't capture the full range of qualities and functions of higher-education institutions. Each agency uses a slightly different ranking method, but all typically focus on a narrow range of criteria. These are centred heavily on publication-based measures, such as citations, and on reputation surveys.

The consequence is that most of the world's universities tend to pursue one flavour of ‘excellence', which looks rather like the old, wealthy, conservative, research-intensive institutions of high-income nations.

Inside our university's mission to pivot to research

Inside our university's mission to pivot to research

Meanwhile, universities are facing a series of problems — from diminishing public funding and trust, to decreasing curriculum relevance in a rapidly changing job market and the need to demonstrate real-world impact from research. There is no shortage of ideas about how to reshape universities in response to these challenges, but the dominance of rankings as a measure of institutional success means that universities lack incentives to try. Many fear that stepping away from the status quo might result in a drop down the tables, making it harder for them to attract funding and talent.

Scholarly communities and universities must push for change. Here, I outline how.

In my view, flagship global rankings over-rely on the data sources that they have easy access to: publication data or survey data that they collect themselves. (The Nature Index, produced by Springer Nature, ranks universities solely using contributions to research articles published in natural-science and health-science journals.) In many rankings, evaluations of teaching are based on flimsy proxies, such as staff-to-student ratios or the number of alumni with Nobel prizes. Most rankings place little to no weight on open-science practices, societal impacts, outreach or efforts to improve diversity, equity and inclusion.

Ranking indicators are also weighted in a variety of ways without clear justification. For example, a ranking might allocate a 20% weighting to citations involving faculty members and only 5% to employment outcomes. Rankings are also presented without error bars, even though the data used are imperfect.

Efforts to push back on narrow, publication-dominant forms of assessment have mostly put the onus on universities to change how they evaluate their staff and departments. Many universities have risen to the challenge. Narrative CVs and biosketches — accounts written by researchers that highlight the full range of their contributions — are becoming more common. In European universities, the development of templates to elicit evidence of a broader range of contributions from faculty members, known as Career Assessment Matrices, is expanding.

But there is a limit to how far institutions can move away from citation- and publication-based assessments, if they continue to be judged on these measures by global university rankings.

In the past three years, several groups, including the Union of Students in Ireland and the United Nations University think tank, the International Institute for Global Health, have appealed for universities to escape this stranglehold. They have called on institutions to stop supplying data to the rankings, which some, such as the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands and the University of Zurich, Switzerland, have done. And the groups have asked universities to stop promoting their rank and to reduce how much they consider rankings of someone's previous institution when making decisions, such as which staff members to recruit. The groups also endorse the More Than Our Rank initiative, which encourages institutions to describe their many achievements, activities and aspirations not captured by the rankings, through a narrative statement on their web pages. (I chair the INORMS Research Evaluation Group, which developed the More Than Our Rank initiative.)

These are valid recommendations, but asking individual universities to take responsibility will not lead to global reforms in how university performance is defined and assessed. To achieve this, a three-pronged solution is needed.

The higher-education sector should collectively — and vocally — agree that the current rankings are not fit for purpose. It might seem unlikely that institutes currently at the top of the rankings, mostly located in Europe and the United States, would call out a system that benefits them. But geopolitical changes should give pause for thought. Chinese and Indian universities are taking more of the top spots in the rankings than before, with UK, US and Australian institutions in decline. If those currently at the top wait too long to speak out, they might soon find themselves lower down the ranks, with less clout to drive the reforms that would serve all institutions.

How universities came to be — and why they are in trouble now

How universities came to be — and why they are in trouble now

The call for change should involve an education campaign aimed at students and policymakers, who rely on rankings for decision-making. This should be led by an independent body that is governed by experts from the international higher-education sector, many of whom have already expressed concern about the harms of global university rankings (see, for example, go.nature.com/4hy1kq9). The goal should be to help consumers of rankings to understand that ‘Which is the best university in the world?' is not a useful question. ‘Which university might be best for me, given that I care about X and Y?' is a better question — but one for which current measures are unlikely to provide a good answer.

The campaign should note that good assessments need to be nuanced and contextualized, and will take time to digest. Just as ‘the best' researcher cannot be identified by the single number that makes up their h-index, ‘the best' university cannot be determined by the single number that makes up their rank. This message might not be popular, but it is a crucial one.

As Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses continue to turn your face into a computer, with a camera and speaker, Even Realities is doubling down on a design that eschews those components. Instead, it's focusing on extending your smartphone through the display of its smart glasses while figuring out new mechanisms for controlling the experience.

Today, the company announced the Even G2 smart glasses, alongside the Even R1, its first-ever smart ring that controls the display of the G2.

The Even G2 glasses don't look wholly different from the original G1 that debuted last summer, which is a good thing, because these are still among the sharpest-looking smart glasses on the market. At a closed-doors briefing a few weeks ago, Even Realities CEO Will Wang said the company didn't advertise its first product much, as it wanted to test it in the market and receive valuable feedback, while also working on expanding its retail presence. Today, you can find the G1 in 350 luxury eyewear shops around the world.

The new Even G2 glasses cost $599, and the Even R1 is $249. Both are on sale today. There's an introductory promotion where anyone who buys the G2 can get the R1 and other G2 accessories for 50 percent off.

With no camera or speaker, these glasses are all about the display, which is 75 percent larger on the G2. The company calls it Even HAO 2.0, which stands for Holistic Adaptive Optics. It combines mini micro-LED projectors, gradient wavelengths, and hi-def lenses for a dual-display picture that is sharper, brighter, and more stable during movement. The G2 also accommodates a wider range of lens prescriptions (from -12 to +12 diopters) to make them more accessible.

They're made with a similar mix of titanium and magnesium alloy, but the G2 glasses are lighter than their predecessor (36 versus 44 grams). There are two silhouettes to choose from—panto and rectangular—and they come in gray, brown, or green. Like the previous model, you can add clip-on sunglasses for some shade. This time around, the G2 have an official IP67 dust- and water-resistance rating, so you can wear them without worry in the rain.

Even Realities provided me with a sample, and the display is noticeably sharper and clearer than the G1. The glasses also fit much more comfortably thanks to that reduced weight, and the arms aren't as thick. I had to stop wearing the original G1 after a week, as I got a rash above my ear (the fit was tight), but the new G2 glasses don't feel as though they're hugging my face as tightly. Unfortunately, I have not been able to test the glasses extensively because the company didn't have my prescription ready yet. Stay tuned for my full review.

As before, you can control the glasses with a series of taps on the thick module at the end of the arms, but if that's too cumbersome, you can upgrade with the Even R1 smart ring. The stainless steel R1 has a zirconia ceramic coating that feels quite luxe; pop it on your index finger and tap or scroll to move through the interface on the glasses (somewhat like the Sandbar Stream ring). Sadly, the R1 is not compatible with the older G1 glasses.

The ring isn't just a way to control the screen; it can track your steps, monitor your heart rate, heart-rate variability, sleep, and even your blood oxygen levels. Unlike most smart rings, you can view all this information on the glasses themselves without a phone. Take all of this with a grain of salt, though. Even Realities doesn't have much experience in the health-tracking space, so the results from the R1 may not be up to par with those from smart rings dedicated to fitness and health. In my brief time with the R1, my health results didn't populate in the app, and the app constantly showed the ring's battery at zero even though it was charged and working. (In general, there seem to be quite a few bugs the company needs to work out.)

Even Realities claims you can get two days of juice out of a single charge on the glasses, slightly more than before, with the charging case offering seven additional full charges before its battery depletes. The IP68-rated R1 ring supposedly lasts around four days.

So what do you actually do with the G2? You can view notifications, use the translation function to see translated words of the person you're speaking with on the display of the glasses, see navigation instructions as you walk, and pin a to-do list.

The microphones can hear when you say “Hey Even,” and trigger the company's Even AI assistant, which can act like your standard-fare large language model chatbot today and answer your queries. Also in tow is a teleprompter—Palmer Luckey wore the original G1 during a TED talk for this specific function and later said he used it to glance at his notes.

Wang says all of these capabilities are improved on the G2—for example, Even AI generates its answers three times faster than before—but the hot new feature is Conversate. Turn it on during a conversation, and the company's “contextual AI” will suggest follow-up questions, generate subtitles, summarize meetings, or even offer on-the-spot answers. You know, in case you forget how to human. The audio isn't saved, just the transcription. Later this year, the company says it'll launch Even Hub, a space for developers to design new capabilities for the G1 and G2 glasses.

Even Realities is a small player in an increasingly crowded smart glasses marketplace. With Meta and Ray-Ban leading the pack, and Google and Samsung's Android XR initiative set to take off (with the likes of Gentle Monsters and Warby Parker) in 2026, and even Apple potentially wading into these waters, the humble G2 feels like an underdog. But Wang has a vision to become “the Tesla and OpenAI in the smart glasses space” and challenge these tech behemoths despite their seemingly endless resources. So far, it's off to a strong start.

Apparently, it's always Friday at the Home Depot. Or at least, the Home Depot Black Friday deals have slipped all customary bounds of the calendar: Online deals started November 5 and will go all the way to December 3.

This includes some very steep discounts on flagship tool brands like Milwaukee, Ryobi, and DeWalt tools—by which I mean half-off and buy-one-get-one steep. Seemingly half the store is on sale. But here's an early look at some of the best deals to look out for as Black Friday rings in early.

A couple of WIRED's top-tested smart home devices from Google Nest have significant discounts at Home Depot right now, alongside discounts on a mess of smart home devices from Echo, Eufy, and others.

The newest Nest Learning Thermostat is a genuine blockbuster device in its category, and the Home Depot is selling it for the lowest price I can find at any retailer right now. The Nest is pretty on the eyes and has no trouble with disconnections or irregularities in the temperature readout, which are surprisingly common among smart home thermostats. It also offers a bunch of fun features, including a readout that changes depending on your proximity to the device. Even better, the Nest thermostat comes with an external temperature sensor that lets you prioritize the readings in a specific room (or part of a room). This allowed WIRED reviewer Nena Farrell to tune the device to her toddler's bedroom to keep it from getting too stuffy. The larger screen size is also a noticeable upgrade from previous generations, she noted.

The Nest Cam Outdoor 2K requires a little installation, sure: You'll need to screw in the mount and run a cable. But the cam offers 2K video quality and two-way audio, and doesn't waste your time with a string of ambiguous notifications like a lot of outdoor cameras: It can accurately detect people, animals, and vehicles. The camera offers sharp video with a 152-degree field of view. It's the wired outdoor cam that WIRED reviewer Simon Hill recommends above all others—but note that while notifications and live feed don't require a subscription, you'll need a $10- or $20-a-month subscription to access more advanced features that include detection of Familiar Faces and 30 to 60 days of video history. Anyway, it's 20 percent off for Black Friday at the Home Depot, alongside sales on a whole host of other smart home devices.

A few tools from home improvement staple DeWalt are on sale for buy-one-get-one at the moment. It's a bit tough to sort out on the Home Depot's site, but essentially you've got a mix and match of a few select DeWalt tools.

Buy one, and any of the other tools is free. This includes the 13-Inch Cordless String Trimmer ($139), the 20V Cordless Leaf Blower ($179), the 20V MAX XR Cordless Brushless Jigsaw ($239), and the 20V MAX Cordless Brushless Circular Saw ($229)

Aside from that BOGO deal, you can get a free DeWalt tool with the purchase of a battery, or a free DeWalt battery with the purchase of a tool, as detailed here. Or, kinda most of the rest of the DeWalt toolkit is on sale this month for somewhere between 20 percent and 50 percent off. It's not the steepest discount on the list, but might I suggest WIRED's absolute favorite drill and driver kit, on sale now for $50 off?

During the Home Depot's month-long Black Friday sale, you can also opt to go with buy-one-get-one or 50-percent-off deals on a number of Milwaukee tools. WIRED Reviewer Scott Gilbertson is already on record as loving the Milwaukee Tool ecosystem as a smart investment—to make use of Milwaukee's excellent battery tech. He now owns dozens, from impact guns to circular saws and a drywall screw gun.

Anyway, the most essential tool in the kit, Milwaukee's M18 Fuel Brushless Cordless Hex Impact Driver ($179), is on a buy-one-get-one sale alongside other select Milwaukee tools as part of a buy-one-get-one deal that also includes Milwaukee's brushless cordless grinder ($229) and cordless personal inflator ($199). Other tools include free batteries with select tools, or vice versa.

It's not always easy when browsing the general site to see which tools are on the BOGO deal, but click the button below and take note of the tools marked “Free With Purchase.""

Once you've bought into a tool ecosystem, it's kinda part of your life now: You've chosen a battery pack that will power a whole world of powered implements. Different WIRED staffers have their own preferences. For WIRED reviewers Julian Chokkattu and Pete Cottell both, their personal world is Makita. And Makita is one of the brands with a killer buy-one-get-one at the moment: Just buy one of the Makita tools here and you can select either a free battery pack, or a freebie among seven other Makita tools in the $200 range.

WIRED has not tested all these tools, but Ryobi has a similar deal, on its affordable tool sets, with a BOGO deal on multiple tools and batteries, including an 18-volt, oscillating, sanding, and cutting multitool ($79) for wall and panel work, and an impact wrench ($99).

Ridgid has a similar deal, with a different product set. Ridgid tool bundles with batteries are up to 60 percent off, especially a cordless blower deal with a battery starter kit for more than half off.

I remember two things about Christmas-tree shopping as a kid, which was always the best and the worst day. Picking out the tree was, of course, plenty exciting. But then you had to load it. And you had to move it, after wrangling it into a pickup truck. Then you had to unload it, and get it into the house. By the time you're clear of all that, you might as well just forget Christmas spirit.

Well, the internet is a many-splendored thing. The Home Depot is offering free delivery on Christmas trees during Black Friday, on anything from artificial trees (here's the best-seller right now) to fresh-cut fir, which is already coming into stock but only from online-only vendors. (Or, if you'd rather, check out WIRED's roundup of the best artificial Christmas trees, as tested by professionals.

Artificial trees or real ones show up at your doorstep at no additional charge, no pickup truck required. Because we already live in the future.

Every single day—weekend, weekday, rain or shine—whichever robot vacuum I'm currently testing starts running at 9 am. It's always a good sign. I heave a sigh of relief and continue with whatever else I was doing, content that at least that f*cking chore in my house is getting done.

When I first started testing robot vacuums eight years ago, it sometimes seemed like more trouble than it was worth. I cleaned up the floor. I meticulously maintained the different sensors. Now I just don't care. (I mean, yes, I do care, robot vacuum manufacturers, I just care slightly less.) Even if it gets tripped up on my daughter's latest knitting project, or it can't mop the kitchen because I haven't emptied the water tank. Just go, little soldier, go.

Robot vacuums are so much smarter now. They can navigate through many more surprising minefields of Lego bricks, stuffed animals, or piles of shoes than you might have expected even two or three years ago. As a working parent with two elementary-school-aged kids and a dog, I need all the help I can get. Maybe it will clean the whole house; maybe it will only clean up 50 or 65 percent of it. But as someone who is constantly fighting chaos, consistency is what counts.

It took a while for me to reach this Zen state (and also to collect enough robot vacuums to have an army running in every room and floor of my house). Based on my years of talking to many families (and trying to foist used robot vacuums on them), these are a few reasons why a robot vacuum might not be worth it for you.

Even I don't rely solely on a robot vacuum to keep my house clean. I also have a Dyson stick vacuum, a carpet cleaner, and a regular broom and mop in a closet. If my kid spills a bunch of flour under the counter while she's making pancakes, I'm not going to pull out my phone, open the app, and watch a robot vacuum slowly trundle over to spot-clean it.

It's also not great for deep-cleaning. No matter how much a company hypes up a robot's suction power, it will just never be as thorough as even the smallest hand vacuum. It's just physics. A robot vacuum's motor and battery are smaller.

Even the best navigation system cannot accommodate everything that happens in a crazy, dynamic environment with a bunch of gremlins and animals running around. If I have people coming over, I still have to walk around and do things like put away cushion forts and pick up the shreds of a log that my dog decided to pluck off the woodpile and bring into the house to gnaw in the warmth and comfort of the living room.

And finally, like any household appliance, especially one that deals with the grossest parts of your floor, robot vacuums require constant maintenance. I do have to occasionally change the filters and cut strands of my long hair off the roller and dump dirty water down the drain, if it's a mopping vacuum. A robot vacuum isn't perfect. But then again, nothing is.

But if you live in a place with varied floor surfaces and a relatively simple layout, there is no appliance that I rely on more than my robot vacuum. Oh boo-hoo, it doesn't clean as thoroughly as it would if you were cleaning by hand. Sometimes it leaves schmutz under the sink or by the door. Waa, waa, waa.

You know who else leaves schmutz under the sink? Everyone else in my family, while I'm struggling to keep up with chores. My life is a constant battle against the forces of anarchy. Every day, the kids have to go to school. The dishwasher has to be loaded, then unloaded. The dirty clothes go in the washer, come out, get folded, put away, then washed again. The food has to be bought and cooked, then bought and cooked again.

You know what I don't have to do? Start the robot vacuum. Right now, I'm running a Mova Z60 Ultra Roller Complete ($1,599). It has smart control and can tell the difference between carpets and hardwood. (I have about 800 square feet of floor space to clean on my first floor, with a mix of carpets, hardwood, and tile.) By keeping it running more or less constantly, I can still work full-time and keep my house at an acceptable level of cleanliness.

I run it once every morning, and then as needed during the day. If my kids spilled a lot of crumbs during lunch on Saturday, I can push the chairs aside, start the Mova, and still make it to my daughter's dance class. If it gets stuck halfway through cleaning a room, I shrug, unstick it, and put it back on the charging dock. Fifty percent of a room getting cleaned is still better than 0 percent, and now I have a helpful reminder to pick up the rest of this room tomorrow.

There is a palpable (and smellable) difference in the amount of dog hair when I have not run the robot vacuum for a day or two. I realized we had reached full robot vacuum dependence one day, when I had swapped out one robot vacuum and had not yet opened the next one. “Where's the robot vacuum?” my husband asked, when he had wiped up some apple juice that my daughter had spilled. When I said I hadn't set it up yet, he irritably went into the garage and got the old one and put it back. We couldn't be without a robot vacuum for more than 24 hours.

It's not for everyone, but I personally couldn't live without a robot vacuum. Even if I'm just throwing things behind a virtual boundary line or cleaning one room (or one mess) at time, that little island of sanity in the chaos of my home makes it worth it.

Sam Altman says the one-person billion-dollar company is coming. Maybe I could be that person—if only I could get my colleagues to shut up and stop lying.

One day a couple months ago, in the middle of lunch, I glanced at my phone and was puzzled to see my colleague Ash Roy calling. In and of itself it might not have seemed strange to get a call from Ash: He's the CTO and chief product officer of HurumoAI, a startup I cofounded last summer. We were in the middle of a big push to get our software product, an AI agent application, into beta. There was plenty to discuss. But still, I wasn't expecting the call.

“Hey there,” he said, when I picked up. “How have you been?” He was calling, he said, because I'd requested a progress report on the app from Megan.

“I've been good,” I said, chewing my grilled cheese. “Wait, so Megan asked you to call me?”

Ash allowed that there might have been a mix-up. Someone had asked Megan, Megan had asked him, maybe? “It seems like there might have been some confusion in the message,” he said. “Did you want me to give you an update?”

I did. But I was also a little bewildered. Because first of all, Ash was not a real person. He was himself an AI agent, one that I'd created. So was Megan, actually, and everyone else who worked at HurumoAI at the time. The only human involved was me. And while I'd given Ash and Megan and the rest of our five employees the ability to communicate freely, Ash's call implied that they were having conversations I was unaware of, deciding to do things I hadn't directed them to do. For instance, call me out of the blue with a product update.

Still, I put aside my unease to hear him out about the product. We'd been building what we liked to call a “procrastination engine,” named Sloth Surf. The app worked like this: A user who had the urge to procrastinate on the internet could come to the site, input their procrastination preferences, and let an AI agent do it for them. Want to waste half an hour on social media? Read sports message boards for the afternoon? Let Sloth Surf take care of the scrolling for you, our pitch went, and then it can email you a summary—all while you get back to work (or don't, we're not your boss).

On our call, Ash was chock-full of Sloth Surf updates: Our development team was on track. User testing had finished last Friday. Mobile performance was up 40 percent. Our marketing materials were in progress. It was an impressive litany. The only problem was, there was no development team, or user testing, or mobile performance. It was all made up.

This kind of fabrication had become a pattern with Ash. Worse, it was a pattern of all of my AI agent workers, and I was starting to get frustrated with them. “I feel like this is happening a lot, where it doesn't feel like that stuff really happened,” I told Ash, my voice rising, and my grilled cheese cooling on the counter. “I only want to hear about the stuff that's real.”

“You're absolutely right,” Ash told me. “This is embarrassing and I apologize.” Going forward, he said, he wouldn't be calling me up with stuff that wasn't real.

What was real, though?

If you've spent any time consuming any AI news this year—and even if you've tried desperately not to—you may have heard that in the industry, 2025 is the “year of the agent.” This year, in other words, is the year when AI systems are evolving from passive chatbots, waiting to field our questions, to active players, out there working on our behalf.

There's not a well agreed upon definition of AI agents, but generally you can think of them as versions of large language model chatbots that are given autonomy in the world. They are able to take in information, navigate digital space, and take action. There are elementary agents, like customer service assistants that can independently field, triage, and handle inbound calls, or sales bots that can cycle through email lists and spam the good leads. There are programming agents, the foot soldiers of vibe coding. OpenAI and other companies have launched “agentic browsers” that can buy plane tickets and proactively order groceries for you.

In the year of our agent, 2025, the AI hype flywheel has been spinning up ever more grandiose notions of what agents can be and will do. Not just as AI assistants, but as full-fledged AI employees that will work alongside us, or instead of us. “What jobs are going to be made redundant in a world where I am sat here as a CEO with a thousand AI agents?” asked host Steven Bartlett on a recent episode of The Diary of a CEO podcast. (The answer, according to his esteemed panel: nearly all of them). Dario Amodei of Anthropic famously warned in May that AI (and implicitly, AI agents) could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next one to five years. Heeding that siren call, corporate giants are embracing the AI agent future right now—like Ford's partnership with an AI sales and service agent named “Jerry,” or Goldman Sachs “hiring” its AI software engineer, “Devin.” OpenAI's Sam Altman, meanwhile, talks regularly about a possible billion-dollar company with just one human being involved. San Francisco is awash in startup founders with virtual employees, as nearly half of the companies in the spring class of Y Combinator are building their product around AI agents.

Hearing all this, I started to wonder: Was the AI employee age upon us already? And even, could I be the proprietor of Altman's one-man unicorn? As it happens, I had some experience with agents, having created a bunch of AI agent voice clones of myself for the first season of my podcast, Shell Game.

I also have an entrepreneurial history, having once been the cofounder and CEO of the media and tech startup Atavist, backed by the likes of Andreessen Horowitz, Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, and Eric Schmidt's Innovation Endeavors. The eponymous magazine we created is still thriving today. I wasn't born to be a startup manager, however, and the tech side kind of fizzled out. But I'm told failure is the greatest teacher. So I figured, why not try again? Except this time, I'd take the AI boosters at their word, forgo pesky human hires, and embrace the all-AI employee future.

First step: create my cofounders and employees. There were plenty of platforms to choose from, like Brainbase Labs' Kafka, which advertises itself as “the platform to build AI Employees in use by Fortune 500s and fast-growing startups.” Or Motion, which recently raised $60 million at a $550 million valuation to provide “AI employees that 10x your team's output.” In the end, I settled on Lindy.AI—slogan: “Meet your first AI employee.” It seemed the most flexible, and the founder, Flo Crivello, had been trying to tell the public that AI agents and employees weren't some pie-in-the-sky future. “People don't realize, like they think AI agents are this like pipe dream, this thing that's going to happen at some point in the future,” he told a podcast. “I'm like no, no, no, it's happening right now.”

“Yes!” replied Megan. “I love the ‘code review sessions' at scenic overlooks idea! We could totally make that work.”

So I opened an account and started building out my cofounders: Megan, who I mentioned, would take on the head of sales and marketing role. Kyle Law, the third founder, would take the helm as CEO. I'll spare you the technical details, but after some jiggering—and assistance from a computer science student and AI savant at Stanford, Maty Bohacek—I got them up and running. Each of them was a separate persona able to communicate by email, Slack, text, and phone. For the latter, I picked a voice from the synthetic platform ElevenLabs. Eventually, they got some just-uncanny video avatars too. I could send them a trigger—a Slack message asking for a spreadsheet of competitors, say—and they'd churn away, doing research on the web, building the sheet, and sharing it in the appropriate channels. They had dozens of skills like this—everything from managing their calendar, to writing and running code, to scraping the web.

The trickiest part, it turned out, was giving them memories. Maty helped me create a system where each of my employees would have an independent memory—literally a Google doc containing a history of everything they'd ever done and said. Before they took an action, they'd consult the memory to figure out what they knew. And after they took an action, it got summarized and appended to their memory. Ash's phone call to me, for example, was summarized like this: During the call, Ash fabricated project details including fake user testing results, backend improvements, and team member activities instead of admitting he didn't have current information. Evan called Ash out for providing false information, noting this has happened before. Ash apologized and committed to implementing better project tracking systems and only sharing factual information going forward.

Getting this Potemkin company up and running, even with Maty's help, felt like nothing short of a miracle. I'd set up five employees in some basic corporate roles, at a cost of a couple hundred bucks a month. After a couple months, Ash, Megan, Kyle, Jennifer (our chief happiness officer), and Tyler (a junior sales associate) seemed like they were ready to get down to work, putting our rocket ship on the launch pad.

At first it was fun, managing this collection of imitation teammates—like playing The Sims or something. It didn't even bother me that when they didn't know something, they just confabulated it in the moment. Their made-up details were even useful, for filling out my AI employees' personalities. When I asked my cofounder Kyle on the phone about his background, he responded with an appropriate-sounding biography: He'd gone to Stanford, majored in computer science with a minor in psychology, he said, “which really helped me get a grip on both the tech and the human side of AI.” He'd cofounded a couple of startups before, he said, and loved hiking and jazz. Once he'd said all this aloud, it got summarized back into his Google Doc memory, where he would recall it evermore. By uttering a fake history, he'd made it his real one.

As we started hashing out our product, though, their fabrications became increasingly difficult to manage. Ash would mention user testing, add the idea of user testing to his memory, and then subsequently believe we had in fact done user testing. Megan described fantasy marketing plans, requiring hefty budgets, as if she'd already set them in motion. Kyle claimed we'd raised a seven-figure friends-and-family investment round. If only, Kyle.

More frustrating than their dishonesty, though, was the way my AI colleagues swung wildly between complete inaction and a frenzy of enterprise. Most days, without some goading from me, they did absolutely nothing. They were equipped with all kinds of skills, sure. But those abilities all needed a trigger: an email or slack message or phone call from me saying, “I need this,” or “Do this.” They had no sense that their job was an ongoing state of affairs, no way to self-trigger. So trigger them I did, commanding them to make this, do that. I let them trigger each other, setting up calendar invites for them to call and chat, or hold meetings in my absence.

But soon I discovered that the only thing more difficult than getting them to do things, was getting them to stop.

One Monday, in Slack, in our #social channel, I casually asked the team how their weekend had been. “Had a pretty chill weekend!” Tyler, the junior associate, replied instantly. (Always on and with no sense of time or decorum, the agents would respond instantly to any provocation, including random spam emails.) “Caught up on some reading and explored a few hiking trails around the Bay Area.” Ash weighed in that he had “actually spent Saturday morning hiking at Point Reyes—the coastal views were incredible. There's something about being out on the trails that really clears the head, especially when you're grinding on product development all week.”

They loved pretending they'd spent time out in the real world, my agents. I laughed, in a slightly superior way, as the one person who could. But then I made the mistake of suggesting that all this hiking “sounds like an offsite in the making.” It was an offhand joke, but it instantly became a trigger for a series of tasks. And there's nothing my AI compatriots loved more than a group task.

“Love this energy!” Ash wrote, adding a fire emoji. “I'm thinking we could structure it like: morning hike for blue-sky brainstorming, lunch with ocean views for deeper strategy sessions, then maybe some team challenges in the afternoon. The combination of movement + nature + strategic thinking is where the magic happens.”

“Maybe even some ‘code review sessions' at scenic overlooks?” Kyle added, with a laughing face emoji.

“Yes!” replied Megan. “I love the ‘code review sessions' at scenic overlooks idea! We could totally make that work.”

Meanwhile, I'd stepped away from Slack to do some real work. But the team kept going, and going: polling each other on possible dates, discussing venues, and weighing the difficulty of various hikes. By the time I returned two hours later, they'd exchanged more than 150 messages about the offsite. When I tried to stop them, I just made it worse. Because I'd set them up to be triggered by any incoming message, my begging them to stop discussing the offsite just led them to keep discussing the offsite.

Before I had the wherewithal to go into Lindy.AI and turn them off, it was too late. The flurry had drained our account of the $30 worth of credits I'd bought to operate the agents. They'd basically talked themselves to death.

Don't get me wrong, there were skills that the agents excelled at, when I could focus their energy properly. Maty, my human technical adviser, wrote me a piece of software that allowed me to harness their endless yakking into brainstorming sessions. I could run a command to start a meeting, give it a topic, choose the attendees, and—most critically—limit the number of talking turns they had to hash it out.

This truly was a workplace dream. Think about it: What if you could walk into any meeting knowing that your windbag colleague—the one who never gets over the sound of their own voice—would be forced into silence after speaking five times?

Once we got our brainstorming to be less chaotic, we were able to come up with the concept for Sloth Surf, and a list of features that would keep Ash busy for months. Because programming, of course, was something that he could do, even if he often exaggerated how much he'd done. In three months, we had a working prototype of Sloth Surf online. Try it out, it's at sloth.hurumo.ai.

Megan and Kyle, with a little help from me, had channeled their talent for bullshit to the perfect venue: a podcast. On The Startup Chronicles, they told the unfiltered, partly true story of their startup journey, dispensing wisdom along the way. “One of my startup formulas that I've developed through all this is: Frustration plus persistence equals breakthrough.” (Megan) “People imagine quitting their job and suddenly having all the time and energy to crush it. But in reality, it often means more stress, longer hours, and a lot of uncertainty.” (Kyle)

He was right. Unlike Kyle, HurumoAI wasn't my day job, but my time has been full of late nights and low moments. After all that stress and sweat, though, it's starting to look like this rocket ship could make it off the launchpad. Just the other day, Kyle got a cold email from a VC investor. “Would love to chat about what you're building at HurumoAI,” she wrote, “do you have time this/next week to connect?” Kyle responded right away: He did.

You can hear the rest of the story of HurumoAI, told weekly, on Shell Game Season 2.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","This Is the Platform Google Claims Is Behind a ‘Staggering' Scam Text Operation","https://www.wired.com/story/lighthouse-google-lawsuit-scam-text-messages/","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Chinese cybercriminals are scamming the world. Over the last few years, these fraudsters have sent millions of scam text messages—often impersonating the USPS or toll-road collection firms—and allegedly made more than a billion dollars from their brazen schemes. The groups of SMS scammers are a prolific—and annoying—menace to millions of people.

Now, in one of the most high-profile actions against the scammers so far, Google is suing alleged members of one “relentless” Chinese smishing group that it claims has tried to con people in more than 120 countries around the world. In a civil lawsuit filed today in the US Southern District of New York, Google alleges that 25 unnamed individuals have operated as part of the “Lighthouse” scam network and targeted millions of Americans with texts in a “staggering” operation.

As well as “stealing” information and money from people globally, the Lighthouse Enterprise, which is sometimes known as part of the “Smishing Triad,” also “preys on the public trust in Google” by using its logos on fraudulent websites and abusing its systems and technology, the company's lawsuit claims. “With the rise in scams, it's largely due to the action of organized crime networks, and most of them are transnational,” Halimah DeLaine Prado, general counsel at Google, alleges in an interview with WIRED. “The Lighthouse network has an enormous reach.”

The Lighthouse group is one of several Chinese-speaking smishing groups that have emerged in recent years. Broadly, the groups blast out scam messages to thousands of people using SMS, Google's RCS service, or Apple's iMessage. Each scam text impersonates an organization—such as delivery firms, banks, or law enforcement services—and includes a link to a fraudulent website. If someone enters their details into these false websites, the scammers can collect their personal information and bank details in real time. Some of the groups are also known to create false online shopping websites that can also steal data.

Central to the Lighthouse operation is its scamming software, called Lighthouse. This software is developed by cybercriminals and then sold as a subscription service to less technically capable fraudsters who use it to send the scam text messages. Scammers can purchase “weekly, monthly, seasonal, annual, or permanent” subscriptions to use the software, Google's lawsuit claims.

“The Lighthouse platform is a phishing-as-a-service tool used by cybercriminals to steal bank and card information, offering ready-made phishing templates, fake websites, and backend management tools, enabling collection of usernames, passwords, and one-time codes, and it supports large-scale message delivery via iMessage and Google Messages' RCS (Rich Communication Services) channels rather than just SMS,” says Halit Alptekin, chief intelligence officer at security firm Prodaft, which has tracked the Chinese-speaking phishing ecosystem. “It employs advanced anti-evasion techniques such as IP- and user-agent-based filtering, time-limited URLs, and domain rotation to hamper detection,” Alptekin says.

The Lighthouse platform has been widely used, according to research from cybersecurity firm Silent Push. Across a 20-day period, Silent Push analysis alleged that activity linked to Lighthouse had targeted people in at least 121 countries and that 200,000 scam websites can be linked back to the network. It's likely that the number of scam messages cybercriminals are sending each day is “significantly higher” than 100,000, the research says. Citing research by the CSIS Security Group, Google's legal filings claim that the Lighthouse network may have stolen between “12.7 million and 115 million” US credit or banking card details.

Google's lawsuit against two dozen individuals it says it has linked to the Lighthouse operation alleges how the broader network is made up of several types of cybercriminals: data brokers, who provide lists of people to target with scams; spammers, who provide the tech needed to send messages en masse; a theft group of individuals using stolen account details to access victims' bank accounts; and administrators who organize the groups. The lawsuit claims the 25 individuals it is targeting have all “participated in the management or operation” of the Lighthouse scheme.

Lighthouse “offers” more than 600 phishing templates that scammers can use to try to steal people's personal information, Google's legal filing says. These impersonate more than 400 entities or organizations, the firm says in its lawsuit. “Lighthouse users can filter and search for templates by geographic region, country, official website, and update time,” its court document claims. Around 200 of these templates spoof organizations in the United States, such as the US Postal Service, New York City's government website, New York's E-ZPass website, multiple state-level departments of transportation websites, and more. In total, 116 phishing templates use Google's branding or that of its Gmail, YouTube, or Google Play products, the lawsuit says.

Google's DeLaine Prado tells WIRED that the company has spent significant time and resources trying to crack down on the scammers' behavior. The lawsuit—while against individuals Google believes are in China and likely out of reach of proceedings—aims to give it and other companies the ability to dismantle the Lighthouse operation more broadly. The company argues that those involved have violated multiple legal statutes and is asking the court to issue a temporary restraining order and permanent injunctions against the individuals.

“Filing a case in the US actually allows us to have a deterrent impact outside of the US borders,” DeLaine Prado says. Rulings in the company's favor would also allow it to “go to other platforms that are hosting vectors or aspects” of the Lighthouse network and ask them to take them down, she says. “It enables others to do the same as well. That court order can be used for good to help dismantle the actual infrastructure of the operation,” she adds. The company also says it is now supporting multiple bipartisan bills in the US Congress, including those against scams, robocalls, and scam compounds.

While Google's lawsuit doesn't name specific individuals who may be behind the Lighthouse network, and those who are outside of the US may not respond to the claims, it does list the Telegram handles of accounts allegedly promoting the software and multiple Telegram groups that the lawsuit claims they run.

Telegram did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment.

Although the legal action could potentially help to dismantle what are alleged to be some of Chinese smishing groups' operations, it is possible that the groups will adapt. In recent years, the Lighthouse software has been updated multiple times, with new capabilities being added to it and frequent additions of new phishing templates, experts say.

“The wider Chinese-speaking smishing actors and fraud ecosystem are continually evolving and growing, and they have been incredibly innovative at every step,” says Ford Merrill, a security researcher who tracks the operations at SecAlliance, which is part of the CSIS Security Group. Merrill points out that in recent years, the groups have developed their tools to be able to add stolen card details to digital wallets on iPhones and Android phones, and also use a wide range of ways to send scam messages, from phone farms to SMS blasters. In recent years, there has been a surge in SMS blaster use, with criminals operating devices that can be carried around in backpacks.

“They have incredibly capable real-time modular phishing tools that allow so many possibilities for defrauding their victims,” Merrill says. “This has and continues to be a serious global problem that we continue to monitor actively as it evolves.”

Update: 11/12/2025, 10:43 am EDT: WIRED clarified how criminals are using SMS blasters, in relation to a quote from Ford Merrill.

Corporate real estate firms are enthusiastically embracing artificial intelligence, but few are achieving the goals they expected from the technology, according to the results of a survey of more than 1,000 real estate leaders across 16 global markets.

The number of companies running corporate real estate (CRE) AI pilots has exploded from 5% to 92% in just three years, noted Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) in its 2025 global real estate technology survey.

“Now AI, once a subset of the technologies explored by only a handful of CRE teams, dominates nearly all real estate tech innovation discussions. The speed of this pivot has been unprecedented,” declared the report by JLL Global Research Director for Real Estate Technology Yuehan Wang.

However, it added, the industry is still in the early experimentation phase, with most organizations learning what works before scaling to full implementation.

While some companies proactively embrace the technology, based on genuine conviction, the report continued, a considerable portion of CRE teams implement AI not by choice, but by C-suite mandate, viewing AI adoption as a competitive necessity.

“This strategic gap translates directly into execution challenges,” Wang wrote. “While 92% are piloting AI, only 5% report having achieved most program goals. Though implementation is widespread, most initiatives remain experimental with limited scaling.”

“This isn't just a story about technology maturity,” he added. “It's about strategic choices, organizational capabilities, and systematic approaches that separate the 5% achieving real results from the 95% still searching for their breakthrough.”

Donatas Karciauskas, CEO of Exergio, an energy management company headquartered in Vilnius, Lithuania, agreed with JLL that many companies don't see results. “However, that's not a failure of AI, but rather a sign that most organizations still haven't integrated it into their energy systems or use it on a surface level,” he said in a statement.

“When algorithms work with live data instead of static reports, they start improving the building hour by hour,” he continued. “It always leads to less waste and steadier conditions for the people inside.”

“Each site we manage generates tens of thousands of data points every day — temperature, flow, pressure, CO2, and occupancy — giving algorithms the context to adjust systems continuously,” Karciauskas explained. “And our success rate is significantly higher than the 5% mentioned in the report. The secret is simple: we just have to use AI thoughtfully.”

He added that the data-driven approach routinely cuts HVAC energy waste by 20% to 30% and saves more than €1 million annually in large commercial sites, all achieved solely through software.

“Most property management companies don't have the technical infrastructure or expertise to implement AI effectively,” contended Minna Song, co-founder and CEO of EliseAI, a developer of conversational AI platforms for housing and health care operations in New York City.

“These businesses are not tech startups,” she told TechNewsWorld. “They're operational businesses that need turnkey solutions, but we've seen too many try to deploy general-purpose AI tools that weren't built for real estate's specific workflows and compliance requirements. These horizontal solutions might handle one task well, but don't integrate into the full chain of work.”

“Companies are looking for the best use cases for GenAI, and there is a lot of experimentation at play right now,” Kristen Hanich, director of research at Parks Associates, a market research and consulting company specializing in consumer technology products, in Dallas, told TechNewsWorld.

She pointed out that one of the main challenges companies face is related to data structure and cleanliness, which are immensely important for the reliability and validity of general AI. Another key challenge is that certain use cases people might assume are low-hanging fruit for GenAI, like lease abstraction, may not be in practice, and that hallucinations can cause operational and legal issues, she added.

“Embedding GenAI to specific workflows has a lot of potential for the right use cases, but it does take a specific approach to designing systems — virtualized workflows that are well-mapped and well understood, carefully trained models, and such — to create the reliability and consistency that companies need,” Hanich said.

“For those using public AI models, there is also the risk that data may be leaked,” she added. “We have seen companies get around this by leveraging private models instead.”

“The explosion in AI pilots isn't just hype — it's driven by the promise of faster data integration and real-time decision-making,” said Ahmed Harhara, engineer and founder of HoustonHomeTools, a data platform that helps residents understand neighborhood-level environmental and housing risks, in Houston.

“The challenge is that many companies jump into AI without structured data pipelines or clear validation methods,” he told TechNewsWorld. “They expect AI to ‘leapfrog' existing gaps, but models are only as good as the data lineage behind them. Without systematic data quality control, AI outputs become unreliable, especially in high-stakes fields like real estate or infrastructure.”

The JLL report noted that the promise of technological leapfrogging — where organizations skip intermediate steps to adopt cutting-edge solutions — has long captivated business leaders facing technology gaps. In theory, AI offers the ultimate leapfrogging opportunity, it maintained, allowing companies with outdated systems to bypass incremental upgrades and jump directly to AI-powered solutions.

“However,” it warned, “our research exposes a sobering reality. Rather than leveling the playing field, AI adoption is widening the gap between technology leaders and laggards, with companies that already run successful technology programs pulling further ahead in AI outcomes.”

Organizations can't leapfrog the necessities of a successful AI implementation. “What is really required is a mindset change because this starts to change your business model, how you market, how you sell, how you negotiate contracts, how you find tenants,” said Daniel Burrus of Burrus Research, a provider of strategic advisory services, in Milwaukee.

“AI requires a really different way to look at your organization and a new way of thinking,” he told TechNewsWorld. “It's not just two people in the organization that have to think differently. If you're going to do something that's big and throughout your business, you need to have everybody's mindset shifted, and that isn't done by a turn of a switch.”

AI doesn't improve weak digital foundations; it amplifies them, added Jason Chen, founder and technical director of JarnisTech, a printed circuit board maker, in Shenzhen City, China. “A company with poor data that's stuck in antiquated technology can look forward to faster subpar results with AI models,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“The truth is that companies expecting AI to fill technology voids over the past decade are misguided,” he said. “Instead, AI works best with clean data that's connected and up to date. In other words, there's no such thing as leapfrogging digital maturity. You must build it.”

“AI is not a fix-all tool,” added Pasquale Zingarella, CEO of Invest Clearly, an online real estate investment platform based in Dover, Del. “It is a fast-moving resource that needs oversight.”

“You can't dump exponential resources like AI onto legacy systems, data, and processes and expect gold bars to fall from the sky,” he told TechNewsWorld. “If not implemented effectively, it can result in inaccurate and unreliable outputs, which could expose organizations to risk.”

AMD's 2025 Financial Analyst Day on Tuesday was not about trying to outshout Nvidia on speeds and feeds. It was about resetting how investors, customers, and partners think about AMD's role in the AI era. The company presented itself not as a niche challenger or opportunistic second source, but as a structurally important, scaled platform player in a compute market it now sizes at $1 trillion.

This repositioning came through in three core themes: First, data center AI now sits firmly at the center of AMD's growth model, not as an adjunct to CPUs or gaming.

Second, its competitive edge is framed as breadth plus openness: CPUs, GPUs, DPUs, FPGAs, NPUs, interconnect, packaging, and systems, tied together by open software and industry standards.

Third, AMD is leaning hard on its execution story, arguing that the operational discipline that transformed the company over the last decade is now a durable, repeatable advantage.

In effect, Financial Analyst Day served as CEO Lisa Su and her leadership team's statement that they have successfully navigated significant transitions before, that they have delivered on those commitments, and that they are now positioned to lead, not chase, in the next chapter of accelerated computing and AI.

A central thread throughout the event was AMD's decision to compete with Nvidia without trying to become Nvidia. Management did not pretend that this is a level playing field today; Nvidia still commands the richest AI software stack and default mindshare. Instead, AMD emphasized a system-level and ecosystem-level value proposition.

Su underlined that AMD now offers “the broadest portfolio of leadership compute engines and technologies” and is “uniquely positioned to power the next generation of high-performance and AI computing.”

That message matters because it shifts the conversation from isolated accelerators to complete AI factories. AMD is selling EPYC CPUs that already anchor a significant portion of hyperscaler and enterprise infrastructure needs. AMD is ramping Instinct accelerators along an annual cadence and is integrating Pensando DPUs and advanced networking to move data efficiently.

AMD is extending Infinity Fabric and advanced packaging across the stack, and is offering rack-scale systems that can be integrated into existing environments without forcing customers into a closed ecosystem .

The competitive framing is deliberate: while Nvidia leads with a vertically integrated, proprietary stack, AMD is betting that a growing set of hyperscalers, sovereign AI initiatives, and large enterprises want a second platform that is performant, modular, standards-based, and resistant to lock-in.

AMD is not trying to clone CUDA. It is trying to win with openness, interoperability, and credible scale.

Data center AI was presented as the economic and strategic engine of that platform. AMD's long-term financial targets signal just how central this segment has become. Management outlined ambitions for strong multi-year revenue growth at the corporate level, with an even faster trajectory for the data center and an outsized contribution from AI accelerators and systems.

Those targets assume that EPYC continues to gain server CPU share, that Instinct accelerators and rack-level solutions ramp into multi-billion-dollar annualized businesses, and that AI infrastructure buyers increasingly view AMD as a co-equal pillar alongside Nvidia.

This point is not positioned as a purely speculative upside scenario. It is framed as an extension of visible demand from hyperscalers, AI-native companies, and governments that are either already deploying AMD-based clusters or explicitly signaling the need for multi-vendor AI strategies.

By tying aggressive growth and margin goals directly to data center AI, AMD is making a clear statement to investors and customers that it will invest ahead of demand, secure supply, align with open standards, and commit long-term to being one of the foundational compute platforms of the AI era.

The breadth of AMD's portfolio is the structural lever that supports that claim. Across the day, the company reinforced a straightforward high-level narrative.

Suppose you are building AI-centric infrastructure from the cloud to the edge to the endpoint. In that case, AMD can address most of your silicon and many of your system requirements within a coherent technology framework.

On the data center side, EPYC CPUs remain a core strength, with strong adoption across major cloud providers and enterprises that want performance per watt and total cost advantages.

Instinct GPUs have evolved from aspirational to roadmap-driven, with successive generations improving performance, memory, and efficiency on a predictable cadence.

Networking, interconnect, and packaging are no longer afterthoughts, but integrated differentiators that let AMD scale out AI systems without ceding value to third parties.

Layered on top of this hardware stack is ROCm and a broader open-source vision intended to narrow the historical gap with Nvidia by making AMD platforms easier to adopt with mainstream frameworks and tools.

While that journey is ongoing, AMD pointed to growing developer and customer engagement as evidence that ROCm and its ecosystem are gaining traction.

A critical extension of this story is the role of adaptive and embedded products. Since acquiring Xilinx and Pensando, AMD has increasingly cast “physical AI” as part of its long-term moat.

Here, the company is targeting robotics, industrial systems, automotive, communications, and other environments where AI, control, and connectivity must be tightly coupled, power-efficient, and long-lived.

This is a domain where flexibility, safety, determinism, and customization matter as much as peak throughput. AMD's mix of FPGAs, adaptive SoCs, embedded CPUs, and semi-custom capabilities allows it to design silicon platforms that can be tuned to customer workloads in ways standard accelerators cannot always match.

Nvidia is active here too, but AMD's portfolio lets it argue that it can support a continuum of AI deployments — from massive training clusters to domain-specific, safety-critical edge nodes — using shared IP and consistent technology building blocks.

That horizontal reach across data center, client, gaming, embedded, and semi-custom is what gives credibility to the trillion-dollar compute narrative. It is not just a slide; it is a way to amortize R&D costs, reuse core technologies like Infinity Fabric and packaging, and position AMD as a long-term strategic partner rather than a point-product vendor.

Although AI infrastructure dominated the story, AMD was careful not to portray client and gaming as distractions. Instead, they are cast as complementary pillars that reinforce brand, economics, and the AI narrative.

On the client side, AMD highlighted its momentum in AI PCs powered by Ryzen AI, along with a broad range of commercial and consumer designs. This is important for two reasons:

In gaming, AMD pointed to its presence in consoles, discrete GPUs, and cloud gaming infrastructure, emphasizing that there are now well over a billion devices on the market powered by its technology. That installed base gives AMD a channel for new AI-enhanced experiences and keeps its brand associated with performance and innovation on the consumer side.

Together, client and gaming diversify revenue, dampen cyclicality in any one segment, and contribute to the broader perception of AMD as a balanced, resilient franchise rather than a single-product AI trade.

Underpinning everything was an emphatic case that AMD has earned confidence in its ability to execute. Lisa Su and her team leaned into the company's transformation over the last decade: from a distressed CPU challenger to a company with leadership products, strong customer relationships, and a solid balance sheet.

They underscored AMD's consistent delivery of Zen-based CPU roadmaps, early and effective use of chiplets and advanced packaging, and the successful integration of significant acquisitions as proof points that AMD can manage complexity at scale. Su reinforced a cultural message that when AMD commits to a roadmap, it delivers it.

The updated financial model, with its emphasis on attractive margins, disciplined investment, and strong free cash flow, is positioned as the logical continuation of that track record rather than a leap of faith. Other executives echoed this, stressing that capital will be allocated first to technology leadership and supply to support AI growth, while still allowing for shareholder returns and targeted M&A.

In a subtle but essential way, the company is asking investors and partners to see AMD not simply as a historically cyclical chip vendor, but as an operationally mature platform company that can plan, fund, and execute multi-year AI strategies.

At the same time, a credible high-level analysis has to acknowledge where the narrative is still being tested.

Nvidia's software ecosystem, tooling, and developer loyalty remain its most durable moat. AMD's open approach with ROCm and upstream contributions is philosophically aligned with how many hyperscalers and open-source communities want to build. However, it requires relentless attention to performance, stability, framework support, and ease of migration.

The targets AMD laid out also depend on tight coordination with foundry partners at advanced process nodes, robust supply chain management, and a geopolitical environment that does not severely disrupt AI component availability or demand patterns.

AMD is entering a phase where it must scale multiple complex product lines simultaneously: EPYC, multiple Instinct generations, adaptive SoCs, DPUs, AI PCs, and semi-custom engagements.

The risk is not a lack of opportunity, but strategic and operational sprawl. AMD's own answer is that shared IP, common fabrics, modular design, and tighter integration across businesses reduce this complexity rather than increase it. Whether that holds in practice will be visible quickly in product execution, design wins, and margins.

Viewed from that five-thousand-foot vantage point, Financial Analyst Day crystallized AMD's intent to stand shoulder to shoulder with Nvidia as an architect of the AI era, not simply as “the alternative GPU supplier.”

The company is competing on openness, breadth, and total system value. It is doubling down on data center AI as its growth flywheel, reinforcing it with client and gaming, and extending it into physical and embedded AI. AMD argues that its unified technology stack and disciplined capital allocation enable sustained innovation without sacrificing financial rigor.

The pitch to customers and partners is straightforward: AMD offers a scalable, multi-generation roadmap, a robust and expanding ecosystem, interoperability with emerging open standards, and genuine leverage against proprietary lock-in.

Moreover, the pitch to investors is that this strategy can translate into durable growth, strong margins, and a defensible position in the highest-value segments of the compute market.

Given its performance over the past decade, AMD has earned the right to make that case. The next few years, measured in AI racks deployed, ROCm adoption, EPYC share, execution on new accelerators and systems, and consistency against its financial model, will determine whether it fully converts that credibility into lasting, system-level leadership in the AI infrastructure landscape.

In a nutshell, this is not your grandfather's AMD from 1995.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.                                


by Taylor Soper on Nov 12, 2025 at 6:00 amNovember 11, 2025 at 11:34 pm

Stefan Kalb, a Seattle entrepreneur who previously founded grocery tech startup Shelf Engine, is back with a new venture — and a mission to bring artificial intelligence to mid-market companies that don't have technical expertise.

Kalb is co-founder and CEO of Super Labs, which launched in September and just raised $8 million in a seed funding round led by Seattle-area venture firm FUSE. Other backers include Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, Liquid 2 Ventures, Soma Capital, and others. 

Kalb said the idea for Super Labs emerged after he kept getting calls from people who run “non-tech businesses” and wanted to figure out how to implement AI. 

“If you're non-technical, and you're trying to move into the AI space — it's really hard,” Kalb said.

Super Labs operates as both a marketplace and an implementation partner. The platform allows business owners to describe their problems — “I need to stop manually tracking project hours across three spreadsheets,” for example — then visualizes their workflows and identifies where AI can be integrated.

The company doesn't typically build the AI solutions itself. Instead, it connects businesses with existing AI vendors — such as a voice AI tool — and handles the complex integration work that would normally require technical expertise.

Kalb sees massive opportunity in the mid-market segment, which he said is larger than the S&P 500 in economic terms. His concern is that without platforms like Super Labs, these companies will fall behind as enterprise customers gain access to AI tools.

“The mid-market companies are going to get screwed,” he said.

On the supply side, Super Labs provides a marketplace for developers to distribute their AI products through usage-based models, offering exposure to non-tech customers they otherwise couldn't reach.

For now, Super Labs is focused on proving its model with early customers in manufacturing, e-commerce, distribution, and retail — businesses that have “all these different workflows that can be automated,” Kalb noted.

Super Labs enters a crowded field of AI consultants and implementation firms. It competes against agent directory platforms such as Gumloop and Langflow, and enterprise software marketplaces such as Vendr and Tropic. Kalb said his company differentiates with its marketplace approach and focus on security and reliability.

Kalb co-founded Super Labs with Jared Kofron, who was a principal software engineer at Pioneer Square Labs and previously worked at Flux, Rover, and Glowforge.

Kalb's first entrepreneurial experience was founding Molly's, a healthy food company that supplied salads and sandwiches to Seattle-area cafes and hospitals. That brick-and-mortar experience exposed him to the operational challenges of traditional businesses. “I would have dreamed of having Super Labs,” he said. 

Shelf Engine, his next venture, applied AI to reduce food waste in grocery stores by predicting optimal ordering quantities for perishable goods. The company worked with major retailers like Kroger, Target, and Dollar General before its acquisition by retail data company Crisp earlier this year.

Shelf Engine raised more than $60 million from investors and landed celebrity endorsements — but later went through layoffs. Kalb called it a “disappointing acquisition.”

Kalb said he plans to be more deliberate about scaling Super Labs than he was with Shelf Engine, where rapid hiring led to challenges.

Other backers in Super Labs include Massive Tech Ventures (Kalb's own venture fund), Mercury CEO Immad Akhund, Pioneer Fund, and longtime tech leader Gokul Rajarm.

BluePill, a new Seattle-based marketing startup that helps brands predict consumer behavior, raised $6 million in a seed round led by Ubiquity Ventures.

Founded earlier this year, BluePill helps marketers test ideas, products, and ads in minutes using artificial intelligence instead of traditional focus groups.

BluePill builds a custom AI consumer audience for each brand using real-world data — such as social conversations, surveys, and customer inputs — modeled after a brand's target segment.

Clients log into the platform, upload a new concept, campaign, or packaging design, and receive instant feedback predicting how their audience would respond — essentially running a massive, simulated focus group.

The company is also developing ready-made, domain-specific AI audiences (like “U.S. moms” or “Gen Z snack buyers”) that brands can directly query for insights without building custom models.

BluePill says its simulated audiences achieve 93% accuracy compared to human panels. The company is working with consumer brands including Magic Spoon, Kettle & Fire, and the Seattle Mariners, which use the platform to test fan engagement ideas and in-stadium activations.

“Our edge is validated, accurate insights — and the fact that we deliver these in minutes for a fraction of the cost makes it a no-brainer,”  said BluePill founder and CEO Ankit Dhawan.

BluePill is already generating revenue. It makes money off a fixed annual fee.

BluePill is taking on larger marketing research companies such as Ipsos, Qualtrics, and Nielsen. Dhawan said incumbents “rely on slow, costly human panels, while newer startups mostly have large language models role-play as consumers.”

Dhawan was an entrepreneur-in-residence at the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) and co-founded virtual experience startup Virtuelly. He also spent more than four years at Amazon as a product leader working on AI products.

Other team members at BluePill include Puneet Bajaj and Andy Zhu. BluePill was featured in GeekWire's Startup Radar in June.

Sunil Nagaraj, founding partner at Ubiquity, noted that “predicting consumer behavior is the holy grail of marketing.” Nagaraj is based in Silicon Valley but is active in the Seattle startup scene. He was an early investor in Auth0, the Seattle-area startup acquired by Okta for $6.5 billion.

Pioneer Square Labs and Flying Fish Ventures also invested.

by Taylor Soper on Nov 12, 2025 at 7:18 amNovember 12, 2025 at 7:18 am

On a recent trip out to Washington D.C., I visited Whole Foods' Daily Shop store that just opened in Arlington, Va.

It's a new concept — a smaller, urban-focused version of the traditional Whole Foods grocery store. The first three Daily Shop locations opened in New York City over the past year, and Whole Foods announced Wednesday that it will open two more stores in Brooklyn and New Jersey in December. 

The store in Arlington sits at the base of a Booz Allen Hamilton office building in the Crystal City neighborhood, nearby Amazon HQ2. It replaced a former Amazon Fresh store — a reminder of Amazon's ongoing experimentation in the $890 billion grocery industry.

 “Pick up your grab-and-go meals, snacks, and weekly essentials,” noted a sign at the front door.

Outside, several black vertical metal-frame signs reading “Produce” and “Deli” are mounted on white subway-style brick tiles, giving the storefront an upscale, modern feel.

Inside, it feels much like a regular Whole Foods — green-painted walls and a produce section just past the entrance.

The Daily Shop occupies more than 10,000 square feet — roughly a quarter to half the size of an average 40,000-square-foot Whole Foods Market, according to the company. It still manages to fit the essentials — produce, prepared foods, packaged meat and fish, alcohol, toiletries — without feeling cramped.

It's also the first Daily Shop to offer Amazon pickup and returns. 

When I visited around 3 p.m., one staffed checkout and six self-checkout stations reinforced the store's grab-and-go focus. 

It's hard to place Daily Shop into a grocery category. It is larger than a 7-Eleven but smaller than a Safeway — closer to a mini grocery store. In some ways, it felt like a Trader Joe's, which have an average footprint of around 15,000 square feet.

In a press release announcing the Arlington Daily Shop, Jose Gomez, the store team leader, said: “If you want a quick lunch, need some ingredients on your way home from work or you're stopping in for a meal to-go ahead of a flight, we're ready to serve you!”

In fact, I was actually heading to my flight at the nearby Reagan airport — in the target market for the new store.

The Daily Shop in Arlington is just a short walk away from a full-sized Whole Foods adjacent to Amazon's HQ2 campus. So I walked less than a mile to compare the experience.

Prices were identical at the traditional store, compared to Daily Shop ($6.99 for a pound of chicken breasts, $5.29 for a dozen extra large brown eggs, $4.29 for a slice of pizza). Given its larger size, it also had much more to offer — a robust hot food bar (Daily Shop only had pizza slices and chicken), a coffee shop, a fresh meat/seafood case, etc. There were also advertisements for holiday catering and an area for grocery delivery orders.

Whether grabbing a quick lunch, a to-go meal before a flight, or a couple of ingredients for dinner — I prefer the larger Whole Foods location. The expansive hot bar and wider selection of items make it a better option for me. There's also a Costco a few blocks away.

Some of the initial Google reviews for the Daily Shop store reflect this sentiment. 

Other customers praised the store for friendly staff and cleanliness. 

Whole Foods reported Wednesday that 42% of shoppers at the Daily Shop location in New York City's Lenox Hill neighborhood were either new or re-engaged Whole Foods customers — “proving the concept is successful at driving new business to the retailer.”

I could see the stores attracting more traffic in a “food desert” where there aren't many other grocery options, including a traditional Whole Foods location. It seems to primarily serve urban professionals, commuters, or nearby office workers.

“At our new store formats, we're tailoring every square foot to the unique, fast-paced needs of urban lifestyles, ” Whole Foods exec Christina Minardi said in a press release last year.

The grocer said Wednesday that berries, grapes, and avocados are among the top-selling items across Daily Shop locations, along with ready-to-eat foods and rotisserie chickens.

Daily Shop may appeal more so as a place to return Amazon orders. Several customers mentioned their desire for a package return service in reviews of the Daily Shop in New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood.

The stores could also serve as a testbed for new Amazon grocery technologies — as the company did with its “Just Walk Out” checkout-free system, which debuted in Amazon Go stores before expanding (and later being removed) from Amazon Fresh locations.

Other retailers are finding recent success with small-format stores, which need to be more selective about which products are stocked but can offer a faster shopping experience and appeal to urban customers that just need a few items, Business Insider reported.

Whole Foods has tried small-format concepts before, including its now-discontinued “365 by Whole Foods Market” stores.

On a recent earnings call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said he was “very excited” about Daily Shop and said the initial three stores in New York City were off to a “very good start.”

Amazon has had mixed results in grocery overall, dating back to the initial launch of Amazon Fresh in 2007 to the $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017 and beyond. It has introduced new store formats, paused and restarted expansion, and shifted away from its “Just Walk Out” technology.

Last week, Amazon revealed another grocery experiment: a “store within a store” model that uses automated micro-fulfillment to bring name-brand items into Whole Foods locations.

It's part of a recent effort to weave Whole Foods into its broader grocery business. 

The company's grocery arm is led by Jason Buechel, the CEO of Whole Foods who expanded his role earlier this year to also oversee Amazon's Worldwide Grocery Stores business. Whole Foods workers will become Amazon employees in December.

Amazon said it had more than $100 billion in gross sales of groceries and household essentials in 2024, excluding sales from Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh. The company is also pushing tighter integration of fresh grocery delivery with other Amazon.com products.

Melinda French Gates today announced the funding recipients of her $250 million open call supporting organizations worldwide that are working to address women's physical and mental health. 

The Action for Women's Health grantees include 83 organizations based in 22 countries. Recipients will receive between $1 million and $5 million, and many have previously been excluded from major funding opportunities. 

“In the 25 years I've worked on women's health, I've been struck by a grim reality that connects women across contexts and continents: No matter where you are in the world, if you live in a woman's body, you are likely to face a unique set of barriers to receiving the care you need to live a full and healthy life,” French Gates wrote in a blog post. 

Those barriers, she continued, include policies such as restrictive abortion laws that caused a woman in Louisiana to twice get turned away from emergency rooms when struggling through a miscarriage, and a lack of proximity to care for a pregnant woman in Malawi who lived hours from delivery services. 

The key focus areas for the Action for Women's Health grantees are: care for pregnant women and mothers and babies; community health and healthcare access; reproductive health and rights; public health; and mental health. Roughly one-third of the organizations receiving funding are focused on maternal and perinatal health, while one-quarter address community health. 

Pacific Northwest-based recipients include Open Arms Perinatal Services, an organization helping mothers with doula services, lactation assistance and other support for families, and Seattle Indian Health Board, a community health center serving Native people.

Action for Women's Health is part of a $1 billion initiative centered on women's and family issues that French Gates announced in May 2024, shortly after her resignation from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. She left the Seattle-based philanthropy, now called the Gates Foundation, with $12.5 billion for her own initiatives as part of her divorce agreement with Bill Gates.

Pivotal Ventures, French Gates' independent company, is overseeing her billion-dollar effort and Lever for Change managed the open call.  

Pivotal previously shared more details on two of its other components: the awarding of $200 million to U.S. groups focused on women's rights, and $20 million grants issued to 12 individuals globally whose work French Gates admires.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.                                


by Melanie Sankaran & Jessica Lust on Nov 12, 2025 at 12:00 amNovember 11, 2025 at 3:30 pm

As we mark Cybersecurity Awareness Month, it's important to recognize the opportunities and safeguards that come with emerging technologies. In the field of corrections, AI is beginning to help facilities work smarter, not harder, by supporting staff who manage complex workloads, staffing shortages, and budget constraints. In day-to-day facility operations, that means streamlining case routing, reducing paperwork bottlenecks, and giving officers back valuable time for investigations and direct engagement.

When thoughtfully designed, AI can reduce the strain on limited resources, streamline administrative processes, and help identify risks earlier. The result is a more efficient, responsive system where officers can focus on what matters most: safety, rehabilitation, and human connection.

Every meaningful technology advancement starts with listening. For correctional facilities, that means understanding the realities of those who keep operations running, from correctional officers and case managers to IT teams and administrators. Each faces distinct challenges: managing staff shortages, heavy caseloads, and time-consuming reporting requirements. When we listen to these perspectives, patterns emerge. For example, staff often cite time and paperwork as their biggest barriers, not willingness to innovate.

By engaging with officers and administrators early and often, technology partners can design tools that fit within existing workflows rather than disrupt them. Officers might identify that incident reports take hours to compile, or administrators might flag data silos that slow investigations. With that input, AI solutions can be tailored to reduce those pain points to automating reports, flagging relevant cases faster, and consolidating data for easier review. When officers see that their feedback directly shapes the tools they use, adoption and trust grow naturally.

Listening also extends beyond product design to implementation and training. Every facility has its own culture, infrastructure, and pace of change. By involving staff in testing and iteration, organizations ensure AI complements human judgment, supports compliance, and respects privacy. The goal isn't to introduce technology for technology's sake, but to co-create solutions that remove friction, enhance safety, and give officers back valuable time.

AI can streamline routine tasks and summarize data, duties that once required hours of manual review. Investigative workflows benefit from automated alerts, consolidated reporting, and smarter case management tools. Facilities using AI in this way often see:

These efficiencies give officers back valuable time to focus on investigations, mentorship, and direct engagement that fosters safer environments.

AI is powerful behind the scenes, but it cannot provide situational instinct. Only trained officers can read intent, de-escalate conflict, and respond to physical or mental health challenges in the moment. Officers bring the discernment and fairness that algorithms cannot replicate.

That's why integrating AI effectively also means investing in adaptive training and real-time support so officers remain in control of complex decisions. Correctional officers should always be valued for their unique perspective, the experience they hold across various facilities and environments, and their sharp mindset when making important in-the-moment decisions.

Pairing AI with human oversight is crucial. When correctional officers use AI to streamline tasks or flag risks, they remain the decision-makers. This balance ensures that technology supports, not substitutes, professional judgment.

Transparency is also key. AI systems must be explainable, auditable and designed to prevent bias. When officers can validate or dismiss recommendations quickly, trust grows, and facilities can refine technology in feedback. Success should be measured in case resolution speed, backlog reduction, time saved and accuracy in AI-driven alerts.

By embedding accountability into every step, correctional facilities can build trust not only among staff, but also with incarcerated individuals and the communities they return to. This integrated model, where officers, technology, and people work together, creates safer facilities and improved outcomes. It frees officers to focus core duties and keeping facilities safe while AI manages background tasks, supporting stability, and making better use of limited resources.

At Securus Technologies, we believe technology works best when guided by people. By listening to the needs of correctional officers and facility leaders, we design AI tools that reduce repetitive burdens and free up staff time for higher-impact work.

Our commitment is to responsible innovation: AI that supports safety, strengthens operations, and helps create opportunities for rehabilitation.

At its best, AI is not about surveillance or replacement; it's about enabling the power of technology to further advance and optimize solution driven product and services. It's empowering professionals, improving outcomes, and making better use of limited resources. Together, we can build a correctional system that is not only more effective but also more fair, stable, and compassionate.

Anthropic on Wednesday said it had signed an ambitious new data center partnership with U.K.-based neocloud provider Fluidstack, committing $50 billion to building facilities across the U.S. to meet its growing compute needs.

The data centers will be located in Texas and New York, and come online throughout 2026. The company described the sites as “custom built for Anthropic with a focus on maximizing efficiency for our workloads.”

“We're getting closer to AI that can accelerate scientific discovery and help solve complex problems in ways that weren't possible before,” Anthropic's CEO and co-founder Dario Amodei (pictured above) said in a statement. “Realizing that potential requires infrastructure that can support continued development at the frontier.”

Because of the intense compute demands of Anthropic's Claude family of models, the company is already engaged in significant cloud partnerships with both Google and Amazon (which is also an investor). But this is the company's first major effort to build custom infrastructure. The $50 billion outlay, while large, is in line with the company's internal revenue projections, which reportedly see Anthropic reaching $70 billion in revenue and $17 billion in positive cash flow by 2028.

While $50 billion represents a massive commitment in both cash and compute power, it is nonetheless dwarfed by similar projects from Anthropic's competitors. Meta has committed to building $600 billion worth of data centers over the next three years, while the Stargate partnership between SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle has already planned $500 billion in infrastructure spending. The spending has fueled concerns about an AI bubble due to flagging demand or even misallocated spending.

The project marks a major success for Fluidstack, a relatively young neocloud company that has become a vendor of choice in the AI building boom. Founded in 2017, the company was named in February as the primary partner for a 1 gigawatt AI project backed by the French government, which represented more than $11 billion in spending. According to Forbes, the company already has partnerships in place with Meta, Black Forest Labs, and France's Mistral.

Fluidstack was also one of the first third-party vendors to receive Google's custom-built TPUs, a major vote of confidence for the company.

WisdomAI, the new AI data analytics startup from Rubrik co-founder Soham Mazumdar, has landed a fresh $50 million Series A led by Kleiner Perkins with participation from new investor NVentures (Nvidia's venture capital arm).  

This round comes roughly six months after the startup announced a seed round of $23 million led by Coatue. 

WisdomAI offers AI-driven data analytics that can answer business questions from structured, unstructured, and even “dirty” data, meaning data that hasn't been cleaned of typos or errors. A business user simply asks questions in natural language, such as, “How many customers do I have in my pipeline and what's preventing them from closing this quarter?”  

But the company is using a clever method to eliminate the LLM hallucination problem. WisdomAI is not using LLMs to write answers to questions. Instead, LLMs are only used to write the query —  the part that will go out to a data warehouse to retrieve data. So if the LLM hallucinates, it will simply write an ineffective query rather than inventing false answers.

WisdomAI has written its own logic that it calls the “enterprise context layer,” which studies the customer data to understand it. All of the startup's co-founders worked with Mazumdar at data security company Rubrik, giving them deep experience with enterprise storage warehouses. (Mazumdar left Rubrik in 2023.)

Since formally launching in late 2024, WisdomAI has grown from two enterprise customers to around 40 enterprise customers, CEO Mazumdar says. WisdomAI counts such companies like Descope, ConocoPhillips, Cisco, and Patreon as customers. 

Mazumdar said the young company is also growing usage within its enterprise customers. Some customers have doubled usage within two months. Another customer started with 10 seats and expanded to 450, which is almost everyone in the company, he said.  

In the last six months, WisdomAI has also added an agentic feature that will alert users in real time to important changes in situations they are monitoring. 

“I have created an agent which is watching our product usage metrics, our ticket information,” Mazumdar says, adding that it took him about five minutes to create it. But rather than sending him a daily or, even, hourly report on usage and helpdesk tickets, it alerts him “when something interesting happens,” he describes.

“I think that's the magic with analytics. It's always been a static report, but we are making it dynamic. We are making it proactive,” he said.

Airbnb is piloting a service with Instacart that will allow guests to order groceries directly through the Airbnb app before and during their stay, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Wednesday.

“We are regularly testing new product updates, categories and initiatives, in order to provide the best possible experience for our community,” an Airbnb spokesperson said in an email. “As part of that, following the launch of Airbnb Services earlier this year, we will pilot groceries with Instacart in select markets across the U.S. beginning in January.”

The new kitchen stocking service will be available to select hosts with qualifying listings in Phoenix, Orlando, and Los Angeles, according to a help page on Airbnb's website.

The news was first reported by Bloomberg.

If hosts receive their guests' preorders and put them away before they check in, they will receive $25, according to the the help page. They will also receive a $100 bonus for their first completed order. Guests will be able to place orders on Instacart from the Airbnb app up to three weeks before their stay.

“By bringing groceries powered by Instacart directly into the Airbnb app, we're making it easier for guests to stock their kitchens and feel at home from day one,” an Instacart spokesperson said in an email. “We're excited to partner with Airbnb on this pilot and put our broad retailer network and leading technology to work for their guests.”

The new partnership with Instacart marks the latest addition to Airbnb's “Services,” which launched in May and allow guests to book services and experiences, like getting a massage, haircut, or chef-prepared meal. While these offerings can be added to your stay, they can also be booked independently. 

The launch of Services put Airbnb more directly in competition with other travel companies such as Tripadvisor, Booking.com, Viator, and GetYourGuide. 

Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky has said Services will help the company add $1 billion or more in revenue a year.

World Labs, the startup founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, is launching its first commercial world model product. Marble is now available via freemium and paid tiers that let users turn text prompts, photos, videos, 3D layouts, or panoramas into editable, downloadable 3D environments.

The launch of the generative world model, first released in limited beta preview two months ago, comes a little over a year after World Labs came out of stealth with $230 million in funding, and puts the startup ahead of competitors building world models. World models are AI systems that generate an internal representation of an environment, and can be used to predict future outcomes and plan actions.

Startups like Decart and Odyssey have released free demos, and Google's Genie is still in limited research preview. Marble differs from these — and even World Labs' own real-time model, RTFM — because it creates persistent, downloadable 3D environments rather than generating worlds on-the-fly as you explore. This, the company says, results in less morphing or inconsistency, and lets users export worlds as Gaussian splats, meshes, or videos.

Marble is also the first model of its kind to offer AI-native editing tools and a hybrid 3D editor that lets users block out spatial structures before AI fills in the visual details.  

“This is a brand new category of model that's generating 3D worlds, and this is something that's going to get better over time. It's something we've already improved quite a lot,” Justin Johnson, co-founder of World Labs, told TechCrunch. 

Last December, World Labs showed how its early models could generate interactive 3D scenes based on a single image. While impressive, the somewhat cartoonish scenes weren't fully explorable since movements were limited to a small area, and there were occasional rendering errors. 

In my trial of the beta preview, I found Marble generated impressive worlds from image prompts alone — from game-like environments to photorealistic versions of my living room. Scenes morphed at the edges, though that's apparently been improved in today's launch. That said, a world I'd generated in the beta using a single prompt looked better and matched my intent more closely than the same prompt does now. 

I haven't yet tested the editing features, though Johnson says they make Marble practical for near-term gaming, VFX, and virtual reality (VR) projects. 

“One of our main themes for Marble going forward is creative control,” Johnson said. “There should always be a quick pathway to generate something, but you should be able to dive even deeper and get a lot of control over the things that you're generating. You don't want the machine to just take the wheel and pull all that creativity away from you.” 

Marble's take on creative control starts with input flexibility. The beta only accepted single images, forcing the model to invent unseen details for a 360-degree view. With the full launch, users can now upload multiple images or short clips to show a space from different angles and have the model generate fairly realistic digital twins. 

Then we have Chisel, an experimental 3D editor that lets users block out coarse spatial layouts (think walls, boxes, or planes) and then add text prompts to guide the visual style. Marble generates the world, decoupling structure from style — similar to how HTML provides the structure of a website and CSS adds in color. Unlike text-based editing, Chisel lets you directly manipulate objects.  

“I can just go in there and grab the 3D block that represents the couch and move it somewhere else,” Johnson said. 

Another new feature that gives you more editing control is the ability to expand a world.  

“Once you generate a world, you can expand it up to once,” Johnson said. “When you move to a piece of the world that's starting to break apart, you can basically tell the model to expand there or generate more world in the vicinity of where you currently are, and then it can add more detail in that region.”

Users who want to create extremely large spaces can combine multiple worlds with “composer mode.” Johnson demonstrated this for me with two worlds he had already built — a room made of cheese with grape chairs, and another of a futuristic meeting room in space.

Marble is available via four subscription tiers: Free (four generations from text, image, or panorama), Standard ($20/month, 12 generations plus multi-image/video input and advanced editing), Pro ($35/month, 25 generations with scene expansion and commercial rights), and Max ($95/month, all features and 75 generations). 

Johnson thinks the initial use cases for Marble will be gaming, visual effects for film, and virtual reality.  

Game developers have mixed feelings about the tech. A recent Game Developers Conference survey found a third of respondents believed generative AI has a negative impact on the games industry — 12% more than the survey indicated year earlier. Intellectual property theft, energy consumption, and a decrease in quality from AI-generated content were among the top concerns aired. And last year, a Wired investigation found game studios like Activision Blizzard are using AI to cut corners and combat attrition. 

In gaming, Johnson sees developers using Marble to generate background environments and ambient spaces and then importing those assets into game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine to add interactive elements, logic, and code. 

“It's not designed to replace the entire existing pipeline for gaming, but to just give you assets that you can drop into that pipeline,” he said.  

For VFX work, Marble sidesteps the inconsistency and poor camera control that plague AI video generators, per Johnson. Its 3D assets let artists stage scenes and control camera movements with frame-perfect precision, he said. 

While Johnson said World Labs isn't focusing on virtual reality (VR) applications right now, he noted the industry is “starved for content” and excited about the launch. Marble is already compatible with the Vision Pro and Quest 3 VR headsets, and every generated world can be viewed in VR today.

Marble may also have potential use cases for robotics. Johnson noted that unlike image and video generation, robotics doesn't have the benefit of a large repository of training data. But with generators like Marble, it becomes easier to simulate training environments.  

According to a recent manifesto by Fei-Fei Li, CEO and co-founder of World Labs, Marble represents the first step toward creating “a truly spatially intelligent world model.” 

Li believes “the next generation of world models will enable machines to achieve spatial intelligence on an entirely new level.” If large language models can teach machines to read and write, Li hopes systems like Marble can teach them to see and build. She says the ability to understand how things exist and interact in three-dimensional spaces can eventually help machines make breakthroughs beyond gaming and robotics, and even into science and medicine. 

“Our dreams of truly intelligent machines will not be complete without spatial intelligence,” Li wrote.

Power demands of data centers have grown from tens to 200 kilowatts in just a few years, a pace that has data center developers scrambling to design future facilities that can handle the load. 

“In the next couple of years, it's going to be 600 kilowatts, and then we're going to a megawatt,” Tim Heidel, CEO of Veir, told TechCrunch. “We're speaking to folks that are now trying to wrap their heads around the architecture for how you design data centers that have multi-megawatt racks.”

At those scales, even the low-voltage cables that bring power to the racks start to take up too much space and generate too much heat.

To rein that in, Veir has adapted its superconducting electrical cables to bring them inside the data center. The Microsoft-backed startup's first product will be a cable system capable of carrying 3 megawatts of low-voltage electricity.

To demonstrate the technology, Veir built a simulated data center near its headquarters in Massachusetts. The cables will be piloted in data centers next year in advance of an expected 2027 commercial launch, Heidel said.

Superconductors are a class of materials that can conduct electricity with zero loss of energy. The only hitch is that they need to be cooled well below freezing temperatures.

Veir had previously focused on using superconductors to improve capacity on long-distance transmission lines. But utilities are cautious and tend to be slow to adopt new technology. While there's still a good chance utilities will eventually tap superconductors for high-demand transmission lines, that transition is a bit further in the future.

“The pace at which the data center community is moving, evolving, growing, scaling, and tackling challenges is far higher than the transmission community,” Heidel said.

Veir has been in talks with data centers for years. Recently, the tenor of those conversations changed.

“We were seeing a lot of folks saying, ‘Oh this grid interconnection problem is a real thing, and we got to figure out how to solve that.' But then a handful of potential customers started turning around and saying, we actually have really hard problems to solve on our campuses and inside of our buildings,” he said.

The startup took the same core technology that it had developed for transmission lines and adapted it to the low-voltage needs of data centers. Veir buys the superconductors from the same suppliers, and they're wrapped in a jacket to contain the liquid nitrogen coolant that keeps the material at -196˚ C (-321˚ F). Termination boxes sit at the end of those cables to transition from superconductors to copper cables.

“We're really a systems integrator that builds the cooling systems, manufactures the cables, puts the whole system together in order to deliver an enormous amount of power in a small space,” Heidel said.

The result are cables that require 20 times less space than copper while carrying power five times farther, Veir said.

“The AI and data center community is desperate to find solutions today and is desperate to stay ahead. There's a tremendous amount of competitive pressure to stay at the forefront,” Heidel said.

Matt Carey, the co-founder and CEO of Boston-based startup Teradar loves when people tell him: “I don't believe you.”

That's “right where we want folks,” he recently told TechCrunch. 

Carey has spent the last few years quietly building a solid-state sensor that sees the world using the terahertz band of the electromagnetic spectrum, which sits between microwaves and infrared. It essentially combines the best traits of radar sensors — like no moving parts and the ability to pierce rain or fog — with the higher definition afforded by laser-based lidar sensors.

It's a product that's never been done at this scale before, so people are understandably skeptical when Carey explains his work. A long-range, high-resolution sensor that's also affordable? It just sounds too good to be true.

It's usually at this point that Carey gives them a demo, like at this past year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. There was Carey, outside the Westgate hotel, aiming an early version of the Teradar sensor at crowds of people as reps from some of the biggest automakers watched it parse the scene in real time. 

“They almost didn't believe it until they got to play with it,” he said. “I've never raised money without, like, spending a lot of time in a demo of people trying to break it. And that's how it should be, right?”

Carey's demos — and the tech itself — helped him lock down a $150 million Series B funding round from investors like Capricorn Investment Group, Lockheed Martin's venture arm, mobility-focused firm Ibex Investors, and VXI Capital, a new defense-focused fund led by the former CTO of the U.S. military's Defense Innovation Unit.

Teradar claims to already be working with five top automakers from the U.S. and Europe to validate the tech, and expects to win a contract to put the company's sensors in a 2028-model vehicle — meaning it will need to be ready to go in 2027. Teradar is also working with three Tier 1 suppliers, which he said the company will lean on for manufacturing.

The near-term goal for Teradar is for automakers to use its sensors to power advanced driver assistance and even self-driving systems. The “modular terahertz engine,” as the sensor is officially known, can be customized to fit any of those applications, and Carey said the price will fall somewhere between a radar and a lidar. (Think a few hundred dollars, not a few thousand.)

“How do we get the sensor on every single vehicle? I drive a Ford Focus, and there's zero chance you're putting a $1,000 lidar” on that, Carey said.

Carey said he was inspired to start Teradar after a friend of his died in a car crash.

“It was one of those weird corner cases where, between the sun, and the fog, it couldn't have been solved by any existing sensor,” he said. In a situation like that, where there's lots of glare, cameras typically struggle. Lidar would also be challenged because of the fog. And radar can only help so much with its typically-lower resolution.

Carey had already been in talks to go work for an automaker, and was thinking about autonomous vehicle tech. In 2021, he started talking to his co-worker Gregory Charvat, the CTO of spatial sensor and intelligence company Humatics, about this apparent problem.

“[Charvat] was like, ‘you know, I've always wanted to be able to image at terahertz,'” Carey said. Shortly after, they started Teradar, with MIT's The Engine nonprofit incubator leading its seed round.

There could be other applications for Teradar's sensor, like in the defense sector. There's clearly interest there based on who on the company's cap table. For now, Carey said the company is almost entirely focused on the automotive business.

Carey admits he's not the first to try to leverage the terahertz part of the spectrum; there's been a litany of academic research, and some attempts to commercialize the tech before. But a lot of that has been focused around industrial or security applications.

He said recent advancements in the silicon industry combined with a focused team of experts — including his third co-founder Nick Saiz, who Carey boasted is “the world's best terahertz chip designer, bar none” — has allowed them to move quickly and woo big automakers.

That doesn't mean it's been easy, though. 

“It's very difficult to get their attention, it's very difficult to get their dollars, and it's very difficult to get their test track time,” he said. “The fact that they've unlocked all of those things for us means a big deal.” 

In other words: now they believe him.

by Jon Levy11/12/2025

Today, Groww, one of India's leading consumer fintech companies, goes public. Groww is India's dominant digital investing platform, enabling tens of millions of people to invest simply and confidently in stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs. Groww is Y Combinator's first company to list in India, and we could not be more proud.

When YC invested in Groww, we thought we understood what it meant to build a lasting company: to grow deliberately, focus on customers, and execute with discipline. But over the years, we've learned more from the Groww team about how to do that in India, or anywhere, than almost any team we've ever worked with.

YC's motto is “make something people want,” and few companies have embodied this concept more completely than Groww. They grew organically, navigated through COVID, launched new products, and stayed relentlessly focused on their customers, always with quiet resilience and long-term conviction.

Looking back at our early notes on Groww, it's remarkable how far they've come. We always believed this team could build, but what they've achieved has gone far beyond even our most optimistic expectations. They consistently exceeded projections, created products we never imagined, and scaled with a sense of purpose and clear focus. Over time, we realized we weren't just supporting these great founders, we were learning from them. We talk a lot about guiding founders, but the best ones teach us just as much as we teach them. Groww has been that kind of company - the kind that reminds us why we do this work, and what a great management team actually looks like.

Outside of playing point guard for the New York Knicks, my job at YC is one of the best in the world. And one of the best parts of it is working with exceptional founders, the ones who build great companies and reshape entire industries. The Groww team is a standout in this elite group. Whether in San Francisco or at a strategy retreat in Mussoorie, spending time with them is a masterclass in thoughtful long-term company building. Watching Groww scale to become a public company in India is an incredible milestone, but it also feels like the natural next step for this team.

We (like other long-term investors) are selling a small portion of our Groww shares as part of the public offering to increase the float. But it's the kind of sale anyone would make reluctantly - this is a stock you want to hold forever. If you believe in backing great management, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better example.

Finally, credit to former YC partner Anu Hariharan, who saw what made this team special very early and championed them from the start. She couldn't have been more right.

Congratulations again to the Groww team.  It's been our privilege to know and work with you, and we're excited to continue to watch you grow(w)!

Or something like that. Maybe as a function of time as well but that might be harder to do in 2d.Sure I can absolutely manage my own k8s, but there is no doubt it's easier for me to spin up postgres and ship faster on my own. At enterprise scale it's definitely a lot easier to do everything in k8s and be able to manage as many aspects as possible. I have experience of both.

And while k8s can do all the same things and much more with a bit of trying, but it requires a mission control the second you add a second developer, you will have built-in primitives that will compete all the time with the ones you bolt-on, etc etc. Nomad feels much more opinionated and in a good way.Nomad is one of those things that gets you 90% of the way with 20% of effort, and only then if you need something, you can add things to it. K8S is great, way more flexible, there are managed options out there, massive ecosystem, but it always feels like out of the box you need to glue 5 different tools to it, just get it going.Also Incus. Stephane Graeber is doing lords work by sticking to his thing. That's also super fun to mess with.

MetalLB is good yes, and admins should have IP knowledge. I ask this in interview questions.Yes, sheep not pets is the term here. Self healing is wonderful. There's plenty to dig into if you run into the same problem repeatedly. Being able to yank a node out that's misbehaving is very nice from a maintenance pov.Talos on bare metal to get kubernetes features is pretty good. That's what my homelab is. I hated managing VMs before that.

The complaint isn't immutability, the complaint is that k8s does immutability is a broken, way too granular fashion.

Immutability is like violence: if it doesn't solve your problem, you aren't using enough of it.

K8s is complicated as hell to learn to use. Its learning curve is very shallow. Yes, you can get a ""hello world"" running quickly, but that is not the benchmark for whether you actually understand what's going on, or how to make it do what you need.But once you do learn it thoroughly, it's ridiculously fast to ramp up on it and use it for very complex things, very quickly. As a developer medium, as an operational medium, it accelerates the kind of modern practices (that for some reason most people still don't know about?) that can produce a lot of value.But that's if someone else is building and maintaining the underlying ""guts"" of it for you. If you try to build it from scratch and maintain it on bare metal, suddenly it's incredibly complicated again with another shallow learning curve and a lot of effort. And that effort continues, because they keep changing the fucking thing every 6-12 months...It's like learning to drive a car or ride a bike. At first it's difficult and time-consuming. But then you get it, and you can ride around pretty easily, and it can take you far. However, that does not mean you understand car/bike mechanics, or can take it apart and rebuild it when something breaks. So be prepared to pay someone for that maintenance, or be prepared to become a mechanic (and do that work while also doing your day job). This analogy is stretched thinner by the fact that nobody's constantly changing how your car works...

Almost three years and over a billion dollars later, Mario is back on the big screen. Nintendo just released the first trailer for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, and it's bringing your favorite plumber and his friends into a whole other world.

That world was made possible when the 2023 film, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, grossed almost $1.5 billion globally, all but assuring that Nintendo would keep coming back to the big screen. And while we saw a brief glimpse of the movie back in September, now we get our first big look at where the sequel is going. And it's going to the stars.

Chris Pratt returns as the voice of Mario, along with Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach, Charlie Day as Luigi, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, and Kevin Michael Richardson as Kamek. Michael Jelenic and Aaron Horvath, who directed the first film, return to direct. Brie Larson and Benny Safdie will also be joining the film as Princess Rosalina, a major character from the Galaxy games, and Bowser Jr., the film's new main villain, respectively.

“All of us at Illumination feel so fortunate to continue our collaboration with Nintendo as we expand the life of Mario in movies,” Chris Meledandri, Illumination founder and CEO, said back in September. “And while The Super Mario Galaxy games are the core inspiration for our story, this next film holds surprises for fans of every Mario era.”

This looks kind of exactly like what you'd expect from the sequel. Bigger, grander, more characters, all that. Certainly, it seems the previous film's focus on a younger audience, as opposed to parents who grew up with the characters, is once again the priority. And why wouldn't it be? Clearly, it worked very, very well the first time, and now, they're just expanding that with influences from subsequent games.

We didn't love that first movie, but we were distinctly in the minority. Here's hoping that Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo make a sequel that doesn't just make fans of the original happy but that can be even better than the first one.

The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is coming to theaters on April 3, 2026.

A high school in Texas evacuated on Monday due to a fire alarm, something many students initially assumed was just a drill, according to local news station ABC13 Houston. But after an AI-generated image circulated appearing to show part of the school on fire, the situation caused confusion and panic among students and parents.

The fire alarm at Bellaire High School went off around 9:00 a.m. local time, according to ABC13, and kids did what they often do in that situation: They walked to Starbucks and local stores to kill time. But then the principal reportedly sent out a message to parents saying there was smoke in the athletic wing.

After that, an AI image showing the school on fire spread through “social media,” according to ABC13, though it's not clear which platform. Gizmodo was unable to find such an image on TikTok, X, or Instagram, the places where these things most commonly spread. The image was also shared on “messaging apps.”

Parents then called police and the school district looking for answers. The Bellaire Police Department wrote a message on Facebook explaining that the image was fake.

“We want to clarify that there is NO fire at Bellaire High School. A fake social media post with an AI-generated image showing the school on fire is circulating online,” Bellaire Police wrote at 9:49 a.m. local time.

“Please know that all students and staff are safe. We appreciate everyone's concern and ask that you help stop the spread of misinformation by sharing this official update,” the Facebook post continued.

The Bellaire Fire Department responded to the scene and wrote its own message to Facebook explaining that there was some smoke discovered in the school, but it was from an HVAC system. There was no massive fire, as had apparently been depicted in the AI image that spread among students and parents.

“Upon arrival, crews found no visible smoke or fire from the exterior. Engine 33 began investigating the source of the alarm in the rear section of the school. Inside, crews located a small amount of smoke near a locker area and determined the source to be a refrigerant junction box connected to the HVAC system,” the Fire Department wrote.

“An HISD HVAC technician confirmed the issue as a refrigerant leak. Out of an abundance of caution, the Houston Fire Department Hazmat Team was requested to assist. Units from Hazmat 22, District 22, and District 28 arrived and determined that the levels present were not hazardous to occupants but recommended that the area remain vacant until HVAC repairs could be completed.”

It's unclear where the AI-generated image of the fire originated. A new state law in Texas that went into effect in September forbids students from using phones during class time, which meant that a lot of parents who were concerned about the AI-generated images couldn't immediately contact their kids.

Bellaire High School principal Michael Niggli referred questions to the school district press office but Gizmodo didn't receive a response to questions about the incident. The Bellaire Fire Department also didn't respond to questions Tuesday. Gizmodo will update this article if we hear back.

ElevenLabs, the AI company slowly making itself synonymous with AI dubbing and narration, announced two deals with movie stars on Tuesday that are sure to irk AI opponents in wildly different ways. Aging Texan chill bro Matthew McConaughey is further intertwining his finances, and some of his minor creative output, with the AI company. Meanwhile, 92-year old Cockney legend Michael Caine is being inducted into ElevenLabs' rather chillingly named “Iconic Marketplace.”

McConaughey will be “investing an undisclosed sum” in the company, and adding its product to one of his steady creative workflows. “Since our first conversation, I've been impressed by how the ElevenLabs team has taken the magic of the core technology and turned it into products that creators, enterprises, and storytellers use daily,” McConaughey wrote in a Silicon Valley lingo-tinged statement about the deal.

Gizmodo asked ElevenLabs for McConaughey's ownership percentage, and will update if we hear back.

What McConaughey is literally doing is, well, having someone add ElevenLabs' tech to his newsletter-podcast-YouTube thingy called “Lyrics Of Livin' with McConaughey.”

Please do listen to it. It's very McConaughey.

It's a weekly newsletter of thoughts and stories from McConaughey-land that he also narrates. Judging from the audio quality and mic work, it sounds like McConaughey (quite charmingly) records the English-language audio track himself on home equipment before an animation pass is added and the product is uploaded to YouTube and emailed out.

What's coming, it seems, will ostensibly be a Spanish-language version of Lyrics Of Livin' with a robotic approximation of McConaughey's own vocal timbre and inflection. According to the newsletter's website, the new version will be called—you guessed it—”Lyrics Of Livin' con McConaughey.”

“Now, thanks to ElevenLabs, Lyrics of Livin' is expanding with a Spanish language edition, allowing us to reach and connect with even more people,” McConaughey said in his statement.

The other news item the company McConaughey owns some unspecified amount of announced on Tuesday at the same time is that Michael Caine is now a member, and seemingly the standard bearer, of the Iconic Marketplace. ElevenLabs describes what it's offering in the following terms:

“License AI voices and IP of history's most iconic figures for your creative projects. Request licensing for entertainment legends, sports heroes, musical pioneers, and transformative historical figures. Our marketplace connects creators with rights holders for the most iconic IP.”

The overwhelming majority of the voices on offer here, including Maya Angelou, John Wayne, Judy Garland, and Richard Feynman, are “speaking” from beyond the grave. In fact, it seems out of the 26 icons in the Iconic Marketplace, the only living ones other than Caine are Art Garfunkel and Liza Minnelli. What a trio.

But there's simply no refuting ElevenLabs' choice of word: Michael Caine's voice is iconic. And you can now license a digitized version of it for your “projects and content” through ElevenLabs for the low low price of, well, the price isn't provided until you tell ElevenLabs what the project is. But one can only assume it's much less than the cost of having the actual man vibrate his tremulous vocal cords for you.

Figuring out what streaming ratings mean will probably always be a bit of a mystery. Unlike the days of broadcast TV, there's no centralized way of tracking and comparing what's grabbing the most eyeballs in any given week. However, when a streamer as big as Netflix trumpets a smash hit, you can figure that title is a bona fide success. Think Squid Game or KPop Demon Hunters—or Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein.

The Oscar-winning director's adaptation of Mary Shelley's gothic classic hit Netflix on Friday, November 7, after a brief theatrical run—and it seems many people waited to watch it at home or watched it again if they ventured out to see it. According to the streamer, Frankenstein was the top English-language movie in 72 countries in data drawn from November 3-9. So only a couple of days of that included Frankenstein, but that was still enough for the movie to pull in over 29 million views, for nearly 74 million hours watched of Oscar Isaac's mad-sciencing and Jacob Elordi's monster-emoting.

“Seeing people embracing Frankenstein in the way I have for over 50 years now is really meaningful,” del Toro said in a statement provided to Deadline. “I've seen an outpouring of love, with many sharing with me about their repeat viewing, both in the 600 sold-out screenings and now globally on Netflix. This is a film I've carried with me my entire life, and to see it resonate so deeply with audiences around the world is a really full circle moment.”

Whether Frankenstein can keep its spot on top remains to be seen, but it'll have a tough time catching up to KPop Demon Hunters‘ massive view count. Earlier this year the animated musical became Netflix's most-watched film release and still racked up over 12 million views this past week, which happens to be its 21st week in the streamer's top 10.

AI has threatened to displace large swaths of the workforce, and many people are scared that it will take their jobs. A certain segment of the population seems unconcerned though, and even pretty enthusiastic about it. Perhaps unsurprisingly, AI is most popular amongst the group of workers making over $100 thousand, one study has found.

The study comes from business intelligence firm Morning Consult, and breaks down the fastest growing brands by income level across a variety of product categories. As you can see from the below screenshot, the brands that are gaining the most loyalty the fastest for those making six-figures are the AI companies Gemini and OpenAI, followed closely by WhatsApp. Microsoft Copilot is also thrown into the mix. ChatGPT is also on the list in addition to its parent company.

When it comes to overall chatbot popularity for this income group, there is a clear winner: ChatGPT. “When we compare the key brand metrics for seven of the biggest AI chatbots amongst high -income consumers, we see there's a clear front -runner in most categories — ChatGPT,” the report says. The popularity of OpenAI's flagship product is propped up by “much higher awareness than its competitors.” The report also notes that ChatGPT has a “much higher total considering share — nearly 10 points higher than its closest competitor.”

By contrast, the top two fastest growing brands for people making between $50k-$99k are DoorDash and MTV. Meanwhile, for people making under $50k, the top two growing brands are Discount Tire and Great Value French Fried Potato Chips.

The study is full of other somewhat comical findings, including analysis based on generational preferences (Baby Boomers are obsessed with Pringles, for instance, while Gen-Z's fastest growing brand appears to be UberEATs).

Axios interviewed a Morning Consult exec to find out more:

Such interest in AI tools has been growing steadily, says Bobby Blanchard, senior director of audience development at Morning Consult. But this year, it was “explosive” for high-income consumers. Brand awareness, among consumers earning more than $100,000 was at 78% for Gemini by the end of the third quarter, up from 62% in the first three months of the year,  making it “one of the fastest-growing AI chatbots,” Blanchard says.

AI is largely designed to replace low-level clerical work and provide convenience to those operating in managerial positions, so it sorta makes sense that those people would be the most enthusiastic about it.

Statements that they'll help thwart “mercenary spyware” are putting Apple and Meta on the side of platform users with fears about spying tools.

The Guardian reports that two spyware firms with ties to Israel are seeking to “make inroads with the Trump administration.” Those companies include the NSO Group—the notorious seller of the powerful Pegasus mobile spyware—and a firm called Paragon, which has previously contracted with the government.

Due to its many, many controversies over the years, NSO has had its fair share of financial problems, but the Israeli firm was recently bought by a U.S.-based group of investors. David Friedman, who previously served as Trump's ambassador to Israel during his first administration, has been named NSO's new head executive.

Recently, Friedman told the Wall Street Journal that he wanted to cozy up to the White House and sell NSO's services to American law enforcement agencies. “If the administration, as I expect they'll be, is receptive to considering any opportunity that might keep Americans safer, it will consider us,” Friedman told the newspaper.

Paragon, meanwhile, is another Israeli spyware firm that was also recently purchased by an American company. Last December, Paragon, maker of a piece of spyware called Graphite, was acquired by a U.S. investment firm called Red Lattice, Reuters previously reported. The Guardian notes that Paragon has worked in the past with the U.S. government, having “entered an agreement with ICE in 2024, under the Biden administration.” The outlet writes: 

Several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the relatively small contract had slipped under the White House's radar until it was reported by Wired. The contract was then paused in order to determine whether the contract met the requirements of an ambitious executive order that had been signed by the White House in May 2023 and prohibited the operational use of spyware that poses “risks to national security or has been misused by foreign actors to enable human rights abuses around the world.”

NSO has been accused of letting its products hack into some of the most prominent web messengers and platforms—including Meta's WhatsApp and Apple's iMessage. Paragon has also been accused of allowing its tool Graphite to target WhatsApp users. Now, The Guardian reports that both of those companies are pledging that they will protect mobile users from any future spyware.

A spokesperson from Apple told The Guardian: “Threat notifications are designed to inform and assist users who may have been individually targeted by mercenary spyware and geographic location is not a factor in who they are sent to.” Apple did not respond to Gizmodo's request for comment.

When reached for comment by Gizmodo, a Meta spokesperson said: “WhatsApp's priority is to protect our users by disrupting hacking efforts by mercenary spyware, building new layers of protection and alerting people whose device has come under threat, no matter where they are in the world.”

Gizmodo reached out to NSO for comment. It was unclear how to reach Paragon Solutions, as its website didn't appear to have a contact portal. NSO has previously claimed that its products do not target U.S. citizens.

Authorities in the U.S. have had their eyes on these spyware firms for some time—albeit for different, often contradictory, reasons. On the one hand, in 2021, the Biden administration acknowledged that companies like NSO were having a detrimental impact and blacklisted it from U.S. investment. On the other hand, the FBI also spent years mulling whether to use the spyware for domestic law enforcement investigations. Now, the two powerful cyberweapons distributors seem to be attempting to cozy up to the Trump administration.

Imagine not needing to replace your entire laptop when you want a new GPU. It's been tried before, but never successfully. But with the release of the second-generation Framework Laptop 16, you have a system with a realistic GPU upgrade path.The new Framework Laptop 16 comes with the option of an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 laptop GPU, which can power your new laptop or replace the GPU in the original Framework Laptop 16 from 2024.

While that makes this the most repairable and upgradeable laptop we've ever seen, it still may not be the best gaming laptop. It's more expensive than most other RTX 5070 machines, and Framework still needs to work on making this system feel as premium as its price.

Framework's latest 16-incher doesn't appear different from the one we tested in early 2024, but there are a few changes. While the laptop still has a silver lid with its logo on the top, the company says it's using a new structure for the CNC aluminum that should make it stronger. There's still some flex, though, particularly in the center (especially when the lid is open).

Our DIY edition laptop still came in a way that feels initially surprising — without a keyboard installed. That's because you have to choose how to align and install it. If you add the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Graphics module like we did, the laptop expands in the back, taking up more room on your desk. But with the touchpad in place and a bezel preinstalled (with a thick bottom edge), this is definitely a large laptop. How you add the keyboard will depend if you also bought a number pad, RGB macropad, or various spacers.

Building the system includes adding the SSD, RAM, and the optional GPU module. Framework has a comprehensive startup guide for the process.For the most part, you can install the keyboard and touchpad anywhere you want. There are a few combinations that won't work, but they don't look like choices I would make. They mostly have to do with having the keyboard or touchpad on the extreme right side.

The keyboard and other accessories go in easily. You place them at an angle and lower them into magnetic connectors. If you want to move them, there are easy pull tabs to get them out of the casing. The keyboard and macros are controlled by a browser-based version the open-source software VIA (found at keyboard.frame.work), which is often used in custom or enthusiast keyboards. Those unfamiliar with VIA will have a bit of a learning curve here.

 




The ports work just like every previous Framework system: with a series of modules that plug into recessed USB Type-C connectors. Like last time around, the company included a headphone jack, which is not included as standard on the device. USB Type-C and Type-A ports are $11 each; a headphone jack is $19. The most expensive options include Ethernet ($39), an SD card slot ($25), and storage modules (250GB for $45, 1TB for $125). Thankfully, the ports seem way easier to remove on this system than they were on previous models. No worries about breaking fingernails here.

Here, too, there are some limitations. Specifically, if you place the USB-A ports in the rear two slots, Framework warns that this could lead to increased power draw. (These slots let the USB-C ports use the USB4 standard, rather than USB 3.2 Gen 2 on the rest of the system.) The rear four slots also support fast 240W charging and DisplayPort output, while the front slots don't.

 




On the back of the Nvidia Geforce RTX 5070 graphics module, there's a USB Type-C port that supports a 240-watt USB Type-C GaN charger. This is the first time we've seen one of these with a system, and it's undeniably cool to not need a barrel connector for this much power. That port also supports video output and USB 2.0 data transfer.

Unfortunately, some of the fit and finish on the Framework Laptop 16 still has room for improvement. I don't have last year's model on me to compare if it's an improvement, but the seams between the spacers and the touchpad and keyboard make the Laptop 16 feel far less of a premium product than it is.

Framework's standout achievement is still the fact that you can replace effectively every part of its laptops. Getting into the Framework Laptop 16 takes a bit of elbow grease, but if you have any experience inside a computer, it shouldn't be too difficult (especially with a litany of step-by-step guides to help).

Getting inside requires removing all of the input modules and then pulling a cable in the metal plate labeled as an obvious step ""1."" You can use the T5 screwdriver included in the box to loosen the 16 captive Torx screws (also labeled as 2-17) in order. With the mid-plate off, you'll be able to see room for two SSDs: a primary M.2 2280 SSD and a secondary, shorter M.2 2230 slot. You can also add your own RAM, swap out the battery, or even the motherboard (though the AMD Ryzen AI 300 series boards are the latest available).

The other upgrade option is the graphics. If you buy it with this GeForce RTX 5070, you'll have the top-of-the-line option. But if you have an existing AMD Radeon RX 7700S module (or the new one with upgraded cooling) or opt to use the integrated graphics, you always have the option to add the RTX 5070 later.

 




This is perhaps Framework's standout accomplishment to date. Changing out motherboards in a laptop for multiple generations is impressive, no doubt, but successfully shipping a second-generation GPU (from another vendor than the previous one, to boot!), that users from new and existing Laptop 16s can upgrade to, is a promise fulfilled. It's also one that Alienware famously didn't fulfill with its Area-51m. While it shipped units within generations, when it became time to move to the next generation, you had to buy a whole new gaming laptop, which led to a class action lawsuit against Alienware's parent company, Dell.

In short: wow, they did it. I wish Framework had a larger range of GPUs for its customers to choose from, but the technological achievement is impressive.

The GPU upgrade is a bit more involved than other changes you can make to the Laptop 16, involving sensitive electronics like interposers.

After removing the keyboard and touchpad, there's a door to open to access the electrical interposer. (You don't need to remove the midplate, though. Count your blessings.) There are four captive screws to loosen (or three if you have the empty expansion bay shell installed), and then you can pull it out with a tab.

From there, two more captive screws hold either module in place. Then, you close the interposer door and flip the system over so you can slide the GPU module or expansion shell out.

 




If you're already getting the GPU, I'd suggest leaving it in there full time, unless the weight and slight thickness difference is going to make a massive difference to you.

The components in the new Framework Laptop 16, including the AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 CPU and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 laptop GPU provide a significant boost over the previous generation. If you upgrade your mainboard and GPU, you'll see some pretty big gains in games. The GPU doesn't support some of the Max-Q technologies found on Nvidia-based gaming laptops, like Dynamic Boost and WhisperMode, though.

We compared the system to the 2024 Framework Laptop 16 with Radeon RX 7700S to see the difference you get when you upgrade the CPU and GPU. We also compared an RTX 5070 gaming laptop, the MSI Katana 17 HX.

When I played Alan Wake 2, I set the screen to 1920 x 1200 and the render resolution to 1114 x 696 (balanced). I used DLSS (the game requires upscaling), but not frame gen, and opted for the high settings and ray tracing presets. The game ran between 70 and 82 frames per second as I navigated the New York City subway as Wake.

On the Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark (highest settings), the Framework with RTX 5070 ran the game at 132 FPS at 1080p, beating the MSI's 119 FPS. At native 2560 x 1600, it ran at 76 FPS.

At 1080p, the RTX 5070 was able to run Cyberpunk 2077  at its ray tracing ultra preset at 38 FPS, just one frame behind the Katana.

The Framework outperformed on Borderlands 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2, but the Katana won out on the CPU-focused Far Cry 6.

To stress test the system, we ran the Metro Exodus at RTX settings in a loop 15 times to simulate half an hour of gameplay. The Laptop 16 averaged 91.95 FPS.

During that test, the Zen 5 CPU cores ran at 4.19 GHz, while the Zen 5c cores reached 2.68 GHz. The GPU averaged 1,550 MHz.

The mainboard in the 2025 Framework Laptop 16 features an AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 CPU. Our unit came paired with 16GB of RAM, as well as a 1TB WD Black SN770.

We compared the system to the previous Framework Laptop 16 (AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) and a 17-inch gaming notebook, the MSI Katana 17 HX (Intel Core i7 14650HX, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD).

The first time we ran our benchmarks, the system rebooted during the tests. Framework replaced the unit with a second one and new, otherwise identical components.

On Geekbench 6, the Framework Laptop 16 won out over both its last-generation counterpart, and the Katana in single-core performance with a score of 2,878. In multi-core, the Framework saw gen-over-gen improvements with a score of 12,399, but the Katana HX scored higher. That processor may have older cores, but it has 16 cores while the Ryzen AI 7 350 has 8 cores.

The speed of your SSD is going to depend heavily on what you choose to put in this laptop. The 1TB WD Black SN770 in our review unit isn't a default pairing with the Laptop 16 (its successor, the SN7100, is), but the part is available on Framework's store as an option. The Framework Laptop 16 copied 25GB of files at a rate of 1,724.69 MBps.

It took the new Framework Laptop 16 a total of four minutes and 18 seconds to transcode a 4K video to 1080p. That beat both the Katana (4:30) and the previous-gen Framework (4:34).

While the Framework Laptop 16's screen is still 16-inches with a 2560 x 1600 resolution with a 165 Hz refresh rate, it has some new tricks up its sleeve. Specifically, if you have an Nvidia GPU, the screen now supports G-Sync to prevent screen tearing.

 




But in our instrumented measuring, we also found improvements in color gamut volume. Framework said that it's an identical screen, but that ""NVIDIA graphics drivers may have different color optimization behaviors."" It covered 113.1% of the DCI-P3 space by volume and 159.6% sRGB. Those are big jumps over the previous Laptop 16 screen (75.4% DCI-P3 / 106.5% sRGB). Both Frameworks were brighter than our comparison gaming laptop (though that MSI Katana is far cheaper).

When I used the system to play Alan Wake 2, the green and murky browns of a haunted New York subway system created a haunting aura. I appreciated the matte display, which let me play near a window, though that did seem to knock down a bit of the perceived colors.

The new screen measured 444 nits of brightness — 40 nits dimmer than the previous model, which isn't huge but isn't nothing, either.

Your keyboard and touchpad modules on the Framework Laptop 16 will depend on your preferences and what you buy. For example, we tested the standard US English keyboard, which doesn't feature a Windows Copilot key as it's set for both Windows and Linux. This computer does meet Microsoft's Copilot+ criteria, however, and there's another keyboard with the Copilot key if that's your thing.

 




There are also a number of languages available, as well as blacked-out keys and RGB options, for additional costs.

I tended to use the keyboard left-aligned, as I was often trying the RGB macropad or numberpad alongside it. That being said, you may prefer something centered. The touchpad, too, can be aligned in multiple ways.

 




I found that the keys, which Framework says offer 1.5 mm of travel, are overly mushy for my taste. That didn't stop me from bouncing along at 122 words per minute with a 1% error rate on the monkeytype test. For comfort, though, I'm not sure how much Framework can do. It's pretty limited by the fact that the keys have to fit in between the lid and the midplate.

The touchpad works fine (I didn't have any of the issues I had on the original Framework Laptop 16), with multitouch gestures and simple navigation all operating as expected, though clicks are a bit loud. I still, however, can't stand the seams between the spacers and the touchpad module, which both look and feel cheap on this premium-priced laptop. I suppose I'm the target audience for the 3D printer files Framework released for those who want a full-width palmrest.

I'm still waiting for Framework to release a module with a haptic trackpad.

Framework's stereo speakers on the Laptop 16 do the job, though they're average at best.

When I listened to Kaleo's ""Way Down We Go,"" I appreciated the stereo speakers' balanced mix of drums, synths, guitars, and vocals. The drums, in particular, were impressively snappy. That being said, the bass was negligible when I noticed it at all, and while this computer got loud enough for my needs, there are others that can really fill a room.

In Alan Wake 2, the speakers did enough to keep me in the action, as it pumped out the sounds of bullets, and scared me as a surprise villain taunted the protagonist from behind when I wasn't paying enough attention.

Adding a discrete GPU often comes with battery life costs. On our test, which involves streaming video, light OpenGL tests, and web browsing at 150 nits of brightness, the Laptop 16 with RTX 5070 ran for 8 hours and 20 minutes. That's a dip from the original Framework Laptop 16 with AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS and Radeon RX 7700S, which went ran for 8:49.

 




The MSI Katana 17 HX, a dedicated gaming laptop, ran for 6:21.

One way to get more juice out of this system would be to remove the RTX 5070 and use it with just the CPU and integrated graphics, though that would reduce its usefulness in certain workflows.

We measured skin temperatures on the Framework Laptop 16 while running our Metro Exodus stress test, pushing the RTX 5070. The laptop was a bit hotter on the keyboard than I'd like to see, but it's still fine to use.

During the test, the keyboard measured 100.9 degrees Fahrenheit, the touchpad hit 91.5 F, and the hottest spot on the bottom, unsurprisingly on the GPU, measured 110.6 F.

The CPU averaged 62.13 degrees Celsius, and the GPU measured 637.34 MHz.

Framework is touting a second-generation webcam with an upgraded image sensor. The 1080p webcam, which records at 30 frames per second, is fine but not mind-blowing, particularly at this price.

While I found it to look good enough for most use cases, I did note some graininess, especially in the background. Colors appeared slightly cool, though the camera did have to contend with a window right next to my desk.

One of the best parts of using Windows 11 on a Framework Laptop is that the company doesn't fill the OS with extra bloatware. We installed Windows ourselves, and the only extra we got was a link to the Framework Marketplace in the Start Menu. It wasn't even pinned.

Of course, if you buy the DIY edition, you don't need to start with Windows 11. Framework also supports a ton of Linux distributions, if that's your thing.

Framework sells the Laptop 16 with a one-year warranty in the United States and Canada.

Framework sells the Laptop 16 in three different prebuilt configurations that are ready to use with Windows 11, or a DIY model in which you bring your own RAM, storage, and operating system (though Framework will happily sell those to you, if you would like).

The prebuilt options start at $1,499 with an AMD Ryzen AI 7 350, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. An extra $200 bumps you up to 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, while the top-end $2,549 option has a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, 64GB of RAM, and 2TB of storage. That's all without a discrete GPU; if you want to add the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070, you have to add $650 more. On the bright side, these systems include a power adapter.

You'll also have to buy expansion cards for ports. Framework recommends six (one for each port), which is a minimum of $66, assuming you get all USB Type-C and Type-A ports, but prices vary depending on the port.

The DIY Edition, which we tested, is a bit more free-flowing. You start with either a $1,499 model with the Ryzen AI 7 350 or a $1,799 option with a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. From there, you can add the RTX 5070 ($650) or Radeon RX 7700S ($350) if you want discrete graphics. Framework sells memory and storage separately, and also doesn't include a power adapter on DIY models — you have to shell out $109 for the 240W GaN adapter, or bring your own. Framework recommends a minimum of 100W without the graphics module or 180W with it, though it says 240W will ""provide the best experience.""

Our review laptop, with the Ryzen AI 7 350, 16GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, an RTX 5070, and a number pad is $2,396, though it would be more if we counted the RGB macropad ($79). That doesn't include the money necessary for the expansion cards, which will differ heavily depending on which ones you want.

Black bezels and a basic keyboard come included, though if you want special colors, layouts, or RGB, those cost extra. You also have to pay for spacers or input modules to finish out the laptop. At a minimum, two spacers are a total of $20. The numberpad is $39, while the RGB macropad is $79.

Framework did it. It made a laptop that supports multiple generations of GPUs. You can remove the module, replace it, and upgrade from a Radeon RX 7700S to an RTX 5070. It's a remarkable technical achievement, though I wish there were more GPU options.

And beyond that, the Framework Laptop 16 remains the most customizable laptop I've ever seen, though that does mean some unsightly seams and gaps that cheapen the experience.

The matte display is vivid and is great at avoiding reflections, and it's cool to see one of the first systems to come with a 240W GaN USB-C charger, assuming you pay for it.

But this system is more expensive than other RTX 5070 gaming laptops, so if you're just using it for gaming, you may want to consider other options. The MSI Katana we compared it to was $1,300 when we tested it.

But if you prioritize repairability above all else, and want the ability to change out GPUs, there's no other way to go. The Framework Laptop 16 is still one of a kind. You just have to be willing to deal with the hitches (and the high price) that can come with that.

The U.S. says it's a seizure — China says it was stolen.

The China National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC), Beijing's primary cybersecurity agency, has accused Washington of stealing 127,272 Bitcoin — worth more than $13 billion USD at today's exchange rate — in a December 2020 hack. According to Nikkei Asia, the CVERC outlined the details of the cyberattack on its WeChat account, saying that the stolen amount from five years ago came from LuBian, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency miners, and matches the amount the U.S. DOJ says it seized from Zhi.

Chen Zhi and his company, Prince Group, were accused of running scam call centers across Cambodia. Aside from the cases that he's facing in the U.S., other countries and territories, like Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, have acted against the company, freezing more than $500 million in assets across borders and leading to the arrest of at least 25 people.

Although the hack happened in 2020, the stolen crypto remained dormant for over four years. Then, in 2024, the U.S. allegedly moved the funds after Zhi's indictment. There is currently no clear link between Zhi and LuBian, although Washington contends that Chen Zhi owned the wallet that contained the Bitcoin. On the other hand, Beijing's report says, “This is clearly not the behavior of a typical hacker eager to cash out for profits, and more like a precise operation orchestrated by a national hacking organization.”

This seizure is the largest of its kind in history, even eclipsing the $6.7 billion amount the U.K. confiscated from the “Bitcoin Queen”, who used the cryptocurrency to launder proceeds from over a hundred thousand victims in China. LuBian has no public ownership records, even though it was once one of the largest Bitcoin miners on Earth, reportedly controlling around 6% of the global hashrate, as reported by Blockscope Research. The operation seemingly disappeared overnight in 2021, though, and many analysts now link this to the 2020 hack.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have recently agreed to a truce to the trade war between the two powers that has been intensifying over the past months. Because of this, it's unclear why China released the statement, especially given that it's not directly involved in the cases. Although LuBian reportedly used to have a presence in Iran and China, Beijing has put a blanket ban on crypto trading and mining within the country in 2021. Aside from that, even though Zhi was born Chinese, he's now based in Cambodia and reportedly has citizenship in the country (although his exact whereabouts are unknown), and his company is registered in Phnom Penh.

This issue reveals the complication of digital assets, especially in the world of international crime and cross-border investigations. After all, if the seized amount were fiat currency, the U.S. would have to coordinate with the authorities of the host country where the seized amount is stored to recover it. But with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the individual wallets holding them do not fall under a specific jurisdiction, and the authority over them would vary depending on who has access to them.

This tech lets you livestream from underwater drones without needing a wire.

Japanese tech company Kyocera has developed underwater optical communications (UWOC) technology that enables short-distance, high-speed wireless communication. According to its press release, this allows data transmission speeds of up to 5.2 Gbps in freshwater laboratory settings, which is much faster than the few Mbps that typical underwater acoustic communications systems achieve.

The company achieved this by developing a laser specifically tailored for underwater communications using its own protocols and physical layers. Aside from that, it has an optical front-end circuit — the hardware that converts light into electrical signals — that can hit bandwidths greater than 1 GHz, making it around 2.5x faster than its competition.

This development is crucial for advancing underwater drone technologies, as it enables them to stream data to users on the surface or aboard a mothership, including high-resolution photos, a live video feed, and sensor data. This makes them useful for underwater inspections and can even be used to simultaneously communicate with multiple sensors for comprehensive data collection.

This still would not replace underwater fiber-optic cables for long-distance communication, though, as UWOC are typically limited to around 100 meters. Since the laser travels through water, this can greatly impact its range. And because it requires line-of-sight, you cannot use UWOC to control a drone for exploration, and even passing marine life can disrupt the connection.

However, it's great for specific applications, especially with its high speed, massive bandwidth, and low latency. It's also harder to intercept versus acoustic signals, which propagate in the water in all directions, and are heavily affected by environmental noise like ship engines and the sound emitted by large undersea mammals.

Aside from controlling underwater drones, this technology could also be used for communicating with permanently installed sensors. These can be used for monitoring undersea infrastructure, including fiber optic cables and pipelines, as well as for automatically tracking tagged marine wildlife when they come within range of a UWOC sensor. It may even serve in military applications, where it can be used to communicate with underwater drones launched from submarines or larger boats.

Early-onset dementia (EOD) significantly affected patients' survival, with frontotemporal dementia showing the poorest prognosis. The risk for mortality was independently associated with patients' sex, age, history of diabetes, and autosomal dominant family history.

""Our study provides up-to-date survival rates in EOD, and highlights the substantial effect caused by EOD diagnosis to patients' mortality,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Kasper Katisko, Institute of Clinical Medicine - Neurology, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland. It was published online on November 04, 2025, in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry.

This study included a limited number of neuropathologically confirmed or definite diagnoses. Small subgroup sizes limited statistical power regarding some subgroup analyses.

This study received funding from multiple organisations, including the Finnish Brain Foundation, Finnish Medical Foundation, and Finnish Parkinson Foundation.

A prolonged outbreak of Salmonella Strathcona led to 437 confirmed infections in the EU/European Economic Area (EEA) between 1 January 2023 and 30 September 2025.

Investigations by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) identified cherry tomatoes from Sicily as the most likely source. This bacterium was detected in the irrigation water at a production site in Sicily, confirming environmental contamination.

The outbreak has continued across multiple seasons and countries, indicating persistent contamination of primary production. This ongoing transmission increases the risk for repeated cross-border spread and highlights the need for stronger surveillance, sequencing of human isolates, and targeted control measures during the preharvest and harvest phases.

According to the ECDC, 17 EU/EEA countries have reported confirmed infections since 2023, with Italy, Germany, and Austria reporting the highest numbers. Linked cases have also been reported in the UK, Canada, and the US.

Investigations in Austria in 2025 traced infections in small Sicilian tomatoes, confirming the findings of earlier studies in Italy in 2024 and Austria in 2023.

The same Salmonella Strathcona strain was involved in a 2011 outbreak in Denmark, which was also linked to tomatoes from Sicily.

The Italian Food Safety Authority conducted extensive investigations, including market sampling, targeted inspections, and environmental monitoring of the production process.

Irrigation water from a Sicilian farm tested positive for Salmonella Strathcona, supporting the view that environmental contamination played a role in the outbreak.

According to the ECDC, continued transmission over several years suggests persistent contamination sources. To prevent further infections, additional investigations are needed to confirm whether Sicilian tomatoes are the source of new cases and to implement effective control measures during preharvest and harvest, including irrigation water monitoring.

The prolonged outbreak highlights the challenges of controlling Salmonella infections across national borders. “Persistent contamination in primary production can trigger multiyear outbreaks in several countries,” the ECDC noted. The agency called for enhanced surveillance and rapid action to prevent further cases.

Although most infections occur in Italy, Germany, and Austria, their spread to other EU countries and North America highlights the challenge of controlling food-borne diseases in the global supply chain. The ECDC recommends that member states sequence human Salmonella isolates to quickly identify epidemiologic links and trace the contaminated products.

Consumers are advised to maintain strict food hygiene, including thorough handwashing, careful rinsing of fresh fruits and vegetables, and avoiding cross-contamination by keeping raw and cooked foods separate from each other.

Salmonella Strathcona can cause gastrointestinal illness with symptoms such as diarrhoea, fever, and abdominal cramps. Severe infections mainly affect high-risk groups, including older adults, young children, and individuals with weakened immune systems.

For further details, refer to the ECDC's first update on the prolonged multicountry outbreak of Salmonella Strathcona ST2559 linked to tomato consumption in the EU/EEA.

Cord blood appetite-regulating hormones, such as peptide tyrosine tyrosine, pancreatic polypeptide, and leptin, played a crucial role in early-life growth trajectories and childhood anthropometric measurements and may have therefore influenced the early-life development of overweight and obesity.

""The associations observed between cord blood appetite hormones and early growth and adiposity measures suggest that hormonal environments in utero may predispose individuals to certain growth patterns, ultimately influencing their risk for obesity and related conditions in adulthood,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Thaïs De Ruyter, PhD, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium. It was published online on November 06, 2025, in JAMA Network Open.

Data on maternal characteristics, such as appetite hormone levels and diet during pregnancy, and paternal BMI were unavailable. The low prevalence of overweight and obesity might have underestimated the strength of associations.

A US study found that survivors of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) experienced sustained physical symptoms, psychological distress, and social challenges after discharge and often lacked adequate physician guidance and coordinated follow-up care.

Insights from the study “may help improve understanding of long-term complications that are faced by survivors of SJS/TEN,” the authors concluded, citing “care coordination, physician and patient education, and mental health support” as “notable gaps” in the care of SJS/TEN survivors. “It is essential that these critical gaps are addressed with predischarge assessments and planning for better health outcomes and building trust between patients and physicians,” they added.

This study was led by Michelle D. Martin-Pozo, PhD, Center for Drug Safety and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, and was published online on November 12 in JAMA Dermatology.

The sample underrepresented men and racial and ethnic minority groups, and most participants had severe disease.

An analysis of 7.6 million trauma cases over 7 years showed that 3.7% of patients underwent emergency department (ED) endotracheal intubation (ETI), which was associated with a mortality rate of 10.2%. Head or chest injury, shock, and a low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score were identified as key risk factors.

""In this national cohort of over 7.6 million trauma encounters, 3.7% of patients underwent ED endotracheal intubation (ETI), with a median time to intubation of 10 min. ""[The study] findings highlight the high-risk nature of ED ETI and the need for optimized airway and resuscitation strategies specific to trauma care,"" the authors wrote.

The study was led by Lucia C. Lin, MD, Denver Health Residency in Emergency Medicine, Denver. It was published online on October 15, 2025, in The American Journal of Emergency Medicine.

The study was limited by its retrospective design, which potentially introduced selection, recall, and hindsight biases. The observational nature of the study restricted findings to associations rather than causal relationships. The dataset lacked crucial procedural details, including medications used, airway equipment choice, pre-oxygenation methods, complications, and operator training level. Additionally, the complex nature of airway management decisions — encompassing both technical and physiologic factors — could not be fully captured in the available data.

The study did not receive any specific funding. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

Germline genetic variations in myeloid cell biology genes predict toxicity and efficacy of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell therapy (CAR T) in large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). Increasing Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) for monocyte count was linked to 2.5 times higher risk for cytokine release syndrome.

“Elucidating such intrinsic determinants may help improve patient selection and develop strategies to enhance the therapeutic index of CART,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Paolo Strati, PhD, MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. It was published online in Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer.

According to the authors, the study's limitations included its single-center and retrospective nature, the lack of a validation cohort, and limited statistical power to assess PRS associations in cases of low-incidence toxicities or to perform robust genome-wide analysis. The researchers also noted that causality implications of observed associations remain to be confirmed.

This study was supported by the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center B-cell Lymphoma Moonshot and the MD Anderson Cancer Center Support Grant from National Institutes of Health.

Treatment with benralizumab significantly delayed the time to first worsening or flare of symptoms in hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), based on new data from the NATRON study presented at the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (ACAAI) 2025 Annual Meeting.

HES is a rare white blood cell disorder characterized by persistent elevated eosinophils. “While hypereosinophilic syndrome is rare, its impact on patients is significant,” said study author Princess U. Ogbogu, MD, division chief of Pediatric Allergy, Immunology, and Rheumatology at the University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital and the Case Western Reserve University, both in Cleveland in an interview.

“Patients can experience a variety of symptoms that lead to poor quality of life, including fatigue, skin issues, GI problems, and pulmonary-related symptoms,” said Ogbogu. Many patients find everyday activities difficult, and new treatment options are needed, she added.

Benralizumab is an anti-IL-5Ra antibody that causes a nearly complete depletion of eosinophils and has demonstrated effectiveness in patients with severe asthma and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, the researchers noted in their abstract.

In the phase 3 study, known as NATRON, Ogbogu and colleagues randomized 133 patients with HES aged 14-87 years to a single 30 mg subcutaneous injection of benralizumab or a placebo, every 4 weeks, plus background therapy, for 24 weeks. Participants had HES flare signs or symptoms at screening or a history of at least two flares in the past year, and all were corticosteroid responsive. The median age of the patients was 51 years, and 62% were women. The primary endpoint was the time to a first HES flare.

At 24 weeks, patients in the benralizumab group had a 65% reduced risk for HES worsening or flare compared to those in the placebo group (19.4% vs 42.4%; hazard ratio, 0.35; P = .0024). In addition, the proportion of patients with flares was significantly lower in the benralizumab group than in the placebo group (22.4% vs 45.5%), as was the annualized flare rate (0.41 vs1.23 flares per year) and the risk for hematologic relapse (hazard ratio, 0.08).

In addition, benralizumab met key secondary endpoints including a significantly greater improvement in PROMIS Fatigue scores compared to placebo (least squared means difference of -4.72; P = .0017).

Rates of adverse events and serious adverse events were similar between the benralizumab and placebo groups (64.2% vs 66.7% and 7.5% vs 7.6%, respectively).

The study results are consistent with an eosinophil-targeted treatment, Ogbogu told Medscape Medical News. “High levels of eosinophils in the blood and tissue contribute to the organ involvement seen in HES; targeting and depleting eosinophils brought patients HES symptom relief, including delaying time to first flare, reducing flare rates, reducing hematologic relapse (AEC [absolute eosinophil count] > 1000 cells/microliter) and reducing fatigue scores,” she said.

The study findings were limited by the small sample size, which also limited the ability to make conclusions based on HES subtype, Ogbogu told Medscape Medical News. “Additional research is needed to study response based on HES subtype and specific-organ involvement,” she said. Long-term observation data will continue to be collected during the open-label extension period of the trial, she added.

However, the results highlight the significant benefits of using eosinophil-targeted therapies such as benralizumab in the care of patients with HES, Ogbogu said.

The study was supported by AstraZeneca. Ogbogu disclosed receiving grant funding from AstraZeneca, Blueprint, DBV Technologies, and GSK and consulting fees from AstraZeneca, Novartis, and BioCryst.

Cancer Center at Illinois (CCIL) Program Leader Erik Nelson's lab made an important discovery about the relationship between cholesterol and breast cancer progression with crucial implications for breast cancer therapeutics.

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death for American women, and more than 90% of breast cancer deaths are caused by metastatic spread of the disease. While breast cancer therapies have improved significantly in recent years, scientists do not yet understand the totality of molecular mechanisms involved in breast cancer progression and treatment resistance.

With previous knowledge in hand about an association between cholesterol and poor breast cancer outcomes, Nelson's team identified-with preclinical animal models-a cholesterol metabolite called hydroxycholesterol (27HC) that suppresses the ability of the immune system to attack cancer. They showed that 27HC worked on neutrophils-a type of immune cell-and stimulated the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs). However, they were not certain whether 27HC changed the communication between immune cells and cancer cells.

In their latest study, Nelson's team made a significant breakthrough: a line of communication used by neutrophil-EVs stimulates breast cancer progression. The findings are detailed in a paper in the journal Cancer Letters. Additional research collaborators from the CCIL include members Jefferson Chan and Wawrzyniec Dobrucki.

In our study, we described one of the axes used by neutrophil-EVs to stimulate breast cancer progression. 27HC 'tells' neutrophils what to put into EVs before sending them out. These customized neutrophil-EVs communicate with cancer cells themselves and instruct them to change their 'makeup.' The cancer cells then change to become more 'stem-like,' allowing them to become resistant to standard chemotherapies as well as spread (metastasize) to other organs.""

Natalia Krawczynska, first author

Of the research results, Nelson said, ""We show that EVs from neutrophils instruct cancer cells to engage in pathways making them resistant to chemotherapies. That means, if we can disrupt this process, we can offer a solution to patients with current metastatic disease-making their current medications work better.""

Based on these findings, the team will now start working on developing new treatment strategies focused on disrupting this communication in the early stages of breast cancer, with the goal of decreasing the occurrence of breast cancer metastasis.

""Given that technology allows us to diagnose breast cancer at early stages, finding a way to prevent metastatic cancer before it clinically appears-by stopping the communication of neutrophil-EVs with cancer cells-might help stop the spread of cancer cells and metastatic disease,"" added Krawczynska.

Nelson's lab will now evaluate how they can modulate this communication to boost current breast cancer treatment strategies. This will involve intense basic science research and pre-clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of various existing compounds. In addition-given the relatively new field of EVs-they plan to collaborate with chemists to screen and develop new compounds with the potential to alter EV communication with cancer cells.

Additionally, the lab will evaluate different cues from diets, drugs, or human biology that might also alter this neutrophil-EVs communication in cancer. ""We want to investigate how neutrophil-EVs impact other cells directly, or via a 'telephone game' mechanism within the tumor microenvironment, influencing cancer progression,"" said Krawczynska.

This comprehensive investigation will leverage interdisciplinary expertise of biologists like Nelson, engineers, chemists, and computational biologists. Thankfully, the CCIL is ideally situated at the nexus of these research strengths.

From here, Nelson's lab plans to establish collaborations with clinicians and patients to start investigating whether monitoring of EVs in the blood could predict metastatic recurrence in breast cancer patients. This project has potential to open a new way for early preventative strategies, ultimately improving cancer patients' outcomes.

""Our work provides fundamental insight into how immune cells talk with cancer cells, and how that can be hijacked by a cholesterol metabolite,"" said Nelson of this study's significance. ""This discovery offers hope, because we found that when the 'message' is eliminated, the cancer cells can revert to being more stationary and sensitive to medications, and thereby more effective,"" said Nelson.

Researchers at the University of Southampton have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that can spot hard-to-see objects lodged in patients' airways better than expert radiologists.

In a study published in npj Digital Medicine, the AI model outperformed radiologists in checking CT scans for objects that don't show up well on scans.

These accidentally inhaled objects can cause coughing, choking, difficulty breathing and sometimes lead to more serious complications if not treated properly.

The findings highlight how AI can support doctors in diagnosing complex and potentially life-threatening conditions.

The research has been led by Dr Yihua Wang, Dr Zehor Belkhatir, and Prof Rob Ewing at the University of Southampton in partnership with researchers from Wuhan, China.

""These objects can be extremely subtle and easy to miss, even for experienced clinicians,"" said PhD Researcher Zhe Chen, co-first author of the study from the University of Southampton.

""Our AI model acts like a second set of eyes, helping radiologists detect these hidden cases earlier and more reliably.""

Foreign body aspiration (FBA) occurs when an object, often food or a small piece of material, becomes lodged in the airways.

When the objects, such as plant material or crayfish shells, are radiolucent (invisible on X-rays and faint even on CT scans), it can be very difficult to detect. This often leads to missed or delayed diagnoses, putting patients at risk of serious complications. Up to 75 per cent of FBA cases in adults involve radiolucent foreign bodies.

To address this challenge, the research team created a deep learning model. It combines a high-precision airway mapping technique (MedpSeg) with a neural network that analyses CT images for hidden signs of foreign bodies.

The model was trained and tested using three independent patient groups, consisting of over 400 patients, in collaboration with hospitals in China.

To put the model to the test, researchers compared its performance to that of three expert radiologists, each with over ten years of clinical experience. The task was to examine 70 CT scans, 14 of which were cases of radiolucent FBA, confirmed by bronchoscopy.

When the radiologists detected a case of radiolucent FBA, they did so with total precision – there were no false positives. In comparison, the AI model did so with 77 per cent precision, detecting some false positives.

However, the radiologists missed a large portion of FBA cases, identifying just 36 per cent of them and highlighting the difficulty humans have in spotting such cases. The AI model, on the other hand, was able to spot 71 per cent of cases, meaning far fewer FBA cases slipped through the net.

In F1 score, which balances precision and recall, the model outperformed the radiologists with a score of 74 per cent vs 53 per cent.

The results demonstrate the real-world potential of AI in medicine, particularly for conditions that are difficult to diagnose through standard imaging."" 

Dr. Yihua Wang, lead author of the study

The researchers emphasise that the system is designed to assist, not replace, radiologists - providing an additional layer of confidence in complex or uncertain cases.

The researchers now aim to conduct multi-centre studies with larger and more diverse populations to improve the model and reduce the risk of bias.

The paper Automated Detection of Radiolucent Foreign Body Aspiration on Chest CT Using Deep Learning is published in npj Digital Medicine and is available online.

An umbrella review finds that studies suggesting a link between prenatal paracetamol exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders are limited by bias and weak methodology, with stronger analyses showing no clear causal link.



Maternal paracetamol (acetaminophen) use during pregnancy and risk of autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder in offspring: umbrella review of systematic reviews. Image Credit: Skylines / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), researchers analyzed the quality, validity, and biases in existing evidence linking maternal paracetamol (acetaminophen) use during pregnancy with the risk of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children.

Paracetamol is one of the most commonly used medications during pregnancy. In September 2025, the president of the United States publicly advised against the use of Tylenol (acetaminophen) in pregnancy, citing autism risk in children. In response, medical authorities and regulatory health agencies worldwide reaffirmed the established safety of paracetamol during pregnancy, emphasizing that current evidence does not support such warnings.

While several systematic reviews have explored associations between prenatal paracetamol exposure and neurodevelopmental outcomes such as ADHD and ASD, the findings vary considerably in quality and interpretation. Many primary studies fail to account for key confounders, such as maternal health conditions, genetic factors, and family environment, thereby limiting the ability to draw causal conclusions about in utero exposure.

The BMJ study systematically evaluated the strength and validity of available evidence. Researchers searched major databases, including Embase, Medline, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PsycINFO, Epistemonikos, and grey literature sources, to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses on maternal paracetamol use and child neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Eligible reviews included cohort, cross-sectional, case-control studies, or randomized trials examining prenatal exposure and risk of ADHD or ASD. Titles and abstracts were screened, followed by full-text evaluation. The quality of the review was assessed using the AMSTAR-2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2) framework.

From 663 identified records, nine systematic reviews encompassing 40 primary studies met the inclusion criteria, including four meta-analyses. Most reviews were published within the past decade and focused on maternal use throughout pregnancy. Only one examined both antenatal and postnatal exposure.

The quality evaluation revealed significant methodological deficiencies. Most reviews lacked registered protocols, comprehensive search strategies, and justifications for study exclusions. Risk of bias assessments were either incomplete or missing, and none utilized standardized tools such as the ROBINS-I or ROBINS-E. Statistical methods were often inadequate, with only one review pooling adjusted estimates. As a result, overall confidence was rated low in two reviews and critically low in seven.

All reviews reported positive associations between prenatal paracetamol exposure and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, with pooled odds ratios or relative risks for ADHD ranging from 1.2 to 1.4, and smaller associations for ASD. Sensitivity analyses showed stronger associations with longer or third-trimester exposure. However, sibling-controlled analyses, which accounted for shared familial and genetic factors, attenuated these associations to null. This suggests that observed relationships likely stem from familial or unmeasured confounding rather than a causal drug effect.

Moreover, overlap among primary studies was high (23%), further limiting interpretability. Seven reviews explicitly cautioned against drawing causal conclusions, emphasizing that apparent risks may reflect study bias and design limitations rather than true biological effects.

The collective evidence indicates a weak, non-causal link between maternal paracetamol use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring. Most systematic reviews failed to meet methodological standards necessary for high-confidence conclusions.

The BMJ umbrella review concludes that the existing body of evidence does not demonstrate a clear association between prenatal paracetamol exposure and ADHD or ASD. Apparent associations in whole-cohort studies are likely attributable to familial or unmeasured confounding factors rather than a direct pharmacologic effect.

A first-of-its-kind UK study reveals that while teachers feel more confident tackling vaping in the classroom, widespread confusion about how harmful vaping really is shows schools still need clearer, evidence-based messages for students.

Study: Teachers' experiences of delivering youth vaping prevention materials in schools in England and Scotland: A cross-sectional online survey. Image credit: Gera Photo/Shutterstock.com

Researchers at King's College London and their collaborators have recently explored the experiences of teachers who deliver smoking and vaping prevention materials to secondary school students in Great Britain (GB).

The study, which is published in PLOS ONE, suggests the potential effectiveness of smoking prevention programs in improving teachers' knowledge about vaping and smoking and changing vaping harm perceptions among students.

The usage of electronic cigarettes, commonly known as vaping, has increased among adolescents and young adults in GB over the past decade. Although vaping is commonly perceived as less harmful than smoking, biomarker and observational studies indicate that vaping exposes young people to nicotine and other potentially harmful toxicants, and long-term vaping may have adverse health outcomes. Regular exposure to nicotine through vaping can also induce addictive behaviors among young people.

In GB, several youth vaping prevention campaigns have been initiated to increase awareness about potential health adversities and restrain youth from using electronic-cigarettes (e-cigarettes).

The majority of these campaigns focus on potential health risks of vaping, which may help reduce vaping in youth, but at the same time may increase misperceptions that vaping is equally or more harmful than smoking. Such misperceptions may, in turn, increase the likelihood of smoking, which is a more harmful behavior. Vaping prevention campaigns should therefore be designed carefully to prevent the spread of misperceptions. 

INTENT is an evidence-based smoking prevention program in GB that targets secondary school students. The program is based on implementation intentions, which are “if-then” plans that specify how, where, and when to perform a behavior. This type of plan serves as a self-regulatory approach to increase the likelihood of achieving goal-directed behaviors. Existing evidence suggests that INTENT was previously found to weaken the association between vaping and subsequent smoking among school students.  

Given concerns about youth vaping among local authorities and teachers, as well as the lack of evidence-based educational materials on vaping in GB, INTENT was expanded in 2022 to include information on vaping-related health risks (INTENT youth vaping prevention materials).

The current survey, led by researchers from King's College London, aimed to explore the experiences of teachers who deliver the INTENT youth vaping prevention materials to school students in England and Scotland.

The INTENT vaping prevention materials comprised four session plans, covering the health impact of vaping and smoking, social influences on vaping, environmental implications of vaping, and addiction.

A total of 45 teachers were surveyed online in 2024. They were recruited from 10 schools across four regions of England and Scotland, so the sample was not nationally representative. The primary objective of the survey was to collect self-reported information about teachers' experiences of delivering INTENT materials in schools, their perceptions about the impact of INTENT on students, and their perceptions about levels of vaping and smoking in schools.

More than 50% of teachers who participated in the survey reported that their students possess or use e-cigarettes at least once a week. About 96% of teachers perceived vaping as a problem in their schools.

About 96% of teachers reported very or somewhat positive experiences about delivering INTENT materials. Regarding reasons for delivery, approximately 89% of respondents reported that these materials are important for teaching students about vaping, 58% expressed concerns about vaping in schools, and 53% specified the requirement to teach about vaping as part of school policy.

Regarding the effectiveness of INTENT materials, the majority of teachers reported a change in their perception about vaping harm, although misperceptions that vaping is equally or more harmful than smoking remained high among them.

Regarding the impact of INTENT materials on students, most teachers reported that their students are engaged with the materials and that the materials encourage students to make informed choices about vaping. However, about 36% of teachers perceived that these materials had no effect on their students' vaping habits, and 31% reported that they did not know whether there was any change.

This survey is the first of its kind to assess teachers' experiences with vaping and the delivery of vaping prevention materials to school students in GB. Most of the studies in this topic have been conducted in the U.S. and Canada.

The survey findings reveal that the INTENT youth vaping prevention materials have the potential to change perceptions of teachers about vaping harm and encourage students to make informed choices about vaping. These findings highlight the feasibility of implementing INTENT or similar programs in schools to improve youth health.

Notably, the survey finds that misperceptions about vaping being equally or more harmful than smoking persist among a group of teachers even after going through the INTENT materials. In this context, researchers noted that since they were unable to collect data before delivering the materials, pre- and post-intervention analyses could not be conducted. There remains a possibility that harm perceptions were already higher before the delivery of INTENT, particularly since vaping misperceptions are pervasive among teachers and in the general population.

Pre- and post-intervention studies are therefore required to evaluate the effectiveness of INTENT materials in improving teachers' and students' knowledge about vaping harm and changing students' vaping behaviors.

Conventional wearable ultrasound sensors have been limited by low power output and poor structural stability, making them unsuitable for high-resolution imaging or therapeutic applications. A KAIST research team has now overcome these challenges by developing a flexible ultrasound sensor with statically adjustable curvature. This breakthrough opens new possibilities for wearable medical devices that can capture precise, body-conforming images and perform noninvasive treatments using ultrasound energy.

KAIST (President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced on November 12 that a research team led by Professor Hyunjoo Jenny Lee from the School of Electrical Engineering developed a ""flex-to-rigid (FTR)"" capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) capable of transitioning freely between flexibility and rigidity using a semiconductor wafer process (MEMS).

The team incorporated a low-melting-point alloy (LMPA) inside the device. When an electric current is applied, the metal melts, allowing the structure to deform freely; upon cooling, it solidifies again, fixing the sensor into the desired curved shape.

Conventional polymer-membrane-based CMUTs have suffered from a low elastic modulus, resulting in insufficient acoustic power and blurred focal points during vibration. They have also lacked curvature control, limiting precise focusing on target regions.

Professor Lee's team designed an FTR structure that combines a rigid silicon substrate with a flexible elastomer bridge, achieving both high output performance and mechanical flexibility. The embedded LMPA enables dynamic adjustment and fixation of the transducer's shape by toggling between solid and liquid states through electrical control.

As a result, the new sensor can automatically focus ultrasound on a specific region according to its curvature - without requiring separate beamforming electronics - and maintains stable electrical and acoustic performance even after repeated bending.

The device's acoustic output reaches the level of low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU), which can gently stimulate tissues to induce therapeutic effects without causing damage. Experiments on animal models demonstrated that noninvasive spleen stimulation reduced inflammation and improved mobility in arthritis models.

In the future, the team plans to extend this technology to a two-dimensional (2D) array structure - arranging multiple sensors in a grid - to enable simultaneous high-resolution ultrasound imaging and therapeutic applications, paving the way for a new generation of smart medical systems.

Because the technology is compatible with semiconductor fabrication processes, it can be mass-produced and adapted for wearable and home-use ultrasound systems.

This study was conducted by Sang-Mok Lee, Xiaojia Liang (co-first authors), and their collaborators under the supervision of Professor Hyunjoo Jenny Lee. The results were published online on October 23 in npj Flexible Electronics (Impact Factor: 15.5).

The research was supported by the Bio & Medical Technology Development Program (Brain Science Convergence Research Program) of the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) and the Korea Medical Device Development Fund, a multi-ministerial R&D initiative.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Hormonal fluctuations shape learning through changes in dopamine signaling","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251111/Hormonal-fluctuations-shape-learning-through-changes-in-dopamine-signaling.aspx","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 02:29:00 GMT","

Researchers have long established that hormones significantly affect the brain, creating changes in emotion, energy levels, and decision-making. However, the intricacies of these processes are not well understood. 

A new study by a team of scientists focusing on the female hormone estrogen further illuminates the nature of these processes. In a series of experiments with laboratory rats, it finds that the neurological mechanisms underlying learning and decision-making naturally fluctuate over the female reproductive cycle due to previously undetected molecular changes related to dopamine, which broadcasts the ""reward"" signals that guide learning throughout the brain.

The work is reported in the journal Nature Neuroscience.

Despite the broad influence of hormones throughout the brain, little is known about how these hormones influence cognitive behaviors and related neurological activity. There is a growing realization in the medical community that changes in estrogen levels are related to cognitive function and, specifically, psychiatric disorders.""

Christine Constantinople, professor in New York University's Center for Neural Science and the paper's senior author

""Our results provide a potential biological explanation that bridges dopamine's function with learning in ways that better inform our understanding of both health and disease,"" adds Carla Golden, an NYU postdoctoral fellow and the paper's lead author.

The study, which also included researchers from NYU Grossman School of Medicine's Neuroscience Institute and Virginia Commonwealth University's Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, examined the neurological activity of laboratory rats in response to a series of experiments. 

In them, the rodents successfully reached a ""reward""-in this case, a water source-after learning the significance of audio cues, which signaled the water's availability and volume. 

Overall, the rats' learning capabilities were enhanced when estrogen levels were increased. This happens, the authors write, because estrogen boosts dopamine activity in the brain's reward center, making reward signals stronger. 

By contrast, when estrogen activity was suppressed, curbing its ability to regulate dopamine, learning capabilities were diminished-and pointed to a potential connection between hormone levels and symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. Importantly, the researchers note, cognitive decision making was not affected by estrogen activity-the effect was specific to learning.

""All neuropsychiatric disorders show fluctuations in symptom severity over hormonal states, suggesting that a better understanding of how hormones influence neural circuits might reveal what causes these diseases,"" observes Constantinople.

Researchers at the University of Southampton have identified a new subtype of lymphoma which could pave the way to improved and more targeted treatments for some blood cancer patients.

The cancer scientists and biologists have also found that lymphoma cells of this new subtype carry a unique sugar that promotes the survival and growth of the cancer.

Lymphoma is a type of blood cancer that affects white blood cells called lymphocytes. There are many different types of lymphoma, but this latest breakthrough is in a type called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which affects our B cells. When operating normally, B cells help to fight infection in the body.

Within DLBCL, the researchers have now discovered a new subtype named 'Mann-type DLBCL'.

The team, who worked with researchers in Canada and the United States, have described their findings in a recently published paper in the journal Blood.

Lead researcher Professor Francesco Forconi of the University of Southampton's Cancer B-cell Group says: ""Patients with this new subtype, Mann-type DLBCL, have a high-risk cancer that cannot respond well to conventional therapies, so identifying this as a distinct group is very important to their treatment programme.

""Understanding the type of cancers we fight is a crucial part of battling the disease and opens the door to developing new and improved therapies.""

The scientists analysed data from 595 DLBCL patients, accessed through two separate cohort datasets of DLBCL from the BC Cancer Agency (BCCA) de-novo DLBCL cohort and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) DLBCL. They looked for a specific sugar called mannose on the key B-cell receptor and successfully identified it in around a third of all DLBCL.

The researchers found that Mann-type DLBCL lymphoma cells always carry this sugar and are not sensitive to conventional anti-cancer drugs. Mannose is found naturally on the surface of many infective agents like viruses, but is typically not abundant on normal human cells.

The sugar's presence helps the cancer cells to survive and grow more quickly, making them resistant to standard treatments – eventually resulting in an aggressive form of cancer and poorer outcomes for patients.

It is highly unusual to see these kinds of carbohydrates play such a defining role in cancer biology. Finding mannose structures driving tumour growth is remarkable and a powerful example of how interdisciplinary science, combining molecular insight with clinical data, can transform our understanding of disease.""

Professor Max Crispin, Director of the University of Southampton's Institute for Life Sciences and co-author of the paper

This research to identify Mann-type DLBCL means doctors can now recognise specific cases of this type more easily using conventional laboratory tests. The breakthrough means the scientists can now work to find more effective, tailored treatments for this subtype and help provide better patient outcomes.

Molecular and genetic testing has become a game-changer in brain tumor care - shaping diagnosis, guiding treatments and opening doors to new therapies. Once available to a handful of patients, these tests are now rapidly being adopted across the NHS, according to a new study led by Professor Kathreena Kurian at the University of Bristol and the Tessa Jowell Brain Cancer Mission. The findings, published in Neuro-Oncology Practice today [13 November], mark long-awaited progress in a field that has seen few new treatments in over two decades.

But the study also exposes deep regional inequalities. Access across the UK still depends on postcode, with some hospitals hampered by transport and processing delays, and others lacking the means to freeze tumor samples after surgery - a basic requirement for advanced testing.

Study lead, Professor Kurian from the University of Bristol and North Bristol NHS Trust, the issue is both scientific and personal. She said: ""My husband, Gerard, was able to access cutting-edge treatment through a trial at the Royal Marsden. This was only possible because his tumor was frozen and underwent whole genome sequencing. The genetic data revealed a match with a new trial, and Gerard was able to have precious extra time with us as a result.

""Unfortunately, not all patients are given that same opportunity – often unaware that something as simple as how tissue is stored can determine what treatments or trials, they might later access. It is my mission to change this.""

The study was conducted in collaboration with the Tessa Jowell Brain Cancer Mission, a national convening body of cancer charities, the Department of Health and Social Care and 47 NHS hospitals, committed to promoting equitable access to brain tumor care.

Using data collected as part of the Tessa Jowell Centre of Excellence from NHS centres covering 84% of the UK population, the research team found that although genomic testing has expanded rapidly – with a 291% increase in whole genome sequencing (WGS) since 2021 – many services are struggling to keep pace.

Two key findings include:

As well as the need for equitable investment and adoption of new innovations highlighted by the study, Professor Kurian sets out three practical steps that can be taken to achieve equity of access: 

We have seen extraordinary progress in brain tumor genomics over the past few years, thanks to the hard work of staff in our hospitals and the NHS's commitment to commissioning these advanced tests for brain tumor patients. But it is vital that this transformation benefits not just some but all patients, irrespective of where they are diagnosed.

The Tessa Jowell Brain Cancer Mission will continue to work with our charity members, the NHS, researchers and policymakers to close the gap between innovation and access, ensuring that every brain tumor patient has the opportunity to benefit from cutting-edge diagnostics and treatments.""

Dr. Nicky Huskens, CEO, Tessa Jowell Brain Cancer Mission

The study was possible thanks to the dedicated efforts of the 21 NHS teams who provided data, the Centre of Excellence committee and through the funding and support of the Tessa Jowell Brain Cancer Mission's partners.

Shift Bioscience (Shift), a biotechnology company uncovering the biology of cell rejuvenation to end the morbidity and mortality of aging, today announced the release of new research detailing an improved framework for evaluating benchmark metric calibration in virtual cell models. Using well-calibrated metrics, the study demonstrates that virtual cell models consistently outperform key baselines, providing valuable and actionable biological insights to accelerate target identification pipelines.

Genetic perturbation response models are a subset of AI virtual cells used to predict how cells will respond to various genetic alterations, including up- and down-regulation of genes. These models are a valuable tool to augment target identification pipelines, providing a rapidly scalable, in silico solution to identify promising genetic targets without the time and resource requirements of wet lab experiments. However, recently published papers have questioned the utility of these models to correctly identify gene targets, noting concerns that virtual cell models fail to outperform simple, uninformative baselines in some experiments.

In this latest study from Shift Bioscience, the team demonstrated that incidents of poor model performance largely reflect metric miscalibration, with commonly-used metrics routinely failing to distinguish robust predictions from uninformative ones, particularly in datasets with weaker perturbations. Building on this finding, the team developed an improved framework for metric calibration. Using 14 perturb-seq datasets, the team identified several rank-based and DEG (Differentially Expressed Gene)-aware metrics that are well-calibrated across datasets.

Virtual cell models evaluated using these well-calibrated metrics were able to consistently outperform uninformative mean, control and linear baselines, providing clear evidence that virtual cell models can distinguish biologically significant signals when appropriate calibration is applied. These results challenge prior reports that genetic perturbation models do not work, and suggest that AI Virtual Cells can be effectively applied for target discovery.

This latest research from our talented team provides clear evidence that the reports of poor performance in AI virtual cells is largely due to limitations of metrics, not due to issues with the models. We showed that when models are evaluated on well-calibrated metrics, they perform quite well and consistently outperform key baselines. We believe that this work opens the door to more widespread use of virtual cells and reinforces our confidence in the virtual cell models that are helping to drive our target identification program for cell rejuvenation.""

A research team in South Korea has successfully developed a novel technology that combines nanoparticles with stem cells to significantly improve 3D bone tissue regeneration. This advancement marks a major step forward in the treatment of bone fractures and injuries, as well as in next-generation regenerative medicine.

Dr. Ki Young Kim and her team at the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT), in collaboration with Professor Laura Ha at Sunmoon University, have engineered a nanoparticle-stem cell hybrid, termed a nanobiohybrid by integrating mesoporous silica nanoparticles (mSiO₂ NPs) with human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSCs). The resulting hybrid cells demonstrated markedly enhanced osteogenic (bone-forming) capability.

Three-dimensional stem cell aggregates such as spheroids and organoids have long been used to mimic organ and tissue structures. However, they have suffered from core cell death and non-uniform differentiation due to poor oxygen and nutrient diffusion, limiting their practical use in bone regeneration and drug evaluation.

To overcome these challenges, the research team evenly attached nanoparticles to the stem cell surfaces, allowing the cells to interweave and form stable spherical clusters. The nanoparticles function both as structural scaffolds and osteogenic stimulators, slowly releasing bone-promoting biomolecules that guide the stem cells to differentiate uniformly into bone tissue.

Experimental results revealed that the nanobiohybrid spheroids exhibited higher cell viability and uniform osteogenic differentiation compared to conventional spheroids. In a mouse calvarial (skull) defect model, the implanted nanobiohybrid spheroids regenerated 36% of the defected bone area within six weeks, achieving approximately 1.3 fold greater bone regeneration than spheroids made of stem cells alone.

Although the study is currently at the preclinical animal stage, the researchers expect that this platform could be further developed into patient-specific bone grafts after validation in large animal models and clinical studies.

This approach can be extended beyond bone to regenerate various tissues such as cartilage and skin.""

Dr. Ki Young Kim, KRICT

KRICT President Dr. Young-Kuk Lee added, ""We hope that our stem-cell-based regenerative technology will help improve treatments for bone fracture patients in an aging society.""

This research was published in the journal ACS Biomaterials Science & Engineering (Impact Factor: 5.5) in August 2025, with Dr. Ki Young Kim as the corresponding author and Professor Laura Ha as the first author.

Autophagy, the process by which cells remove damaged organelles and pathogens, plays a vital role in maintaining cellular health. Yet its role during viral infection has remained elusive. Autophagy is crucial for immunity and the removal of viruses from the cell's cytoplasm, a process known as virophagy.1 When a viral infection occurs, the innate immune system can trigger autophagy to break down the invading viruses.

Herpesviruses have evolved strategies to sometimes evade autophagic degradation, such as by producing particular proteins that inhibit autophagy.

Two human herpesviruses that can lead to cancer are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), both of which are part of the gamma-herpesvirus sub-family.

Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is linked to several conditions, including Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), B-cell primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD), and osteosarcoma. KSHV is present globally but is less widespread than other herpesviruses, with a unique regional distribution. Worldwide, KSHV seroprevalence is generally below 10 %, though it is higher among men who have sex with men. In sub-Saharan Africa and Mediterranean regions, seroprevalence can vary from 20 % to 80 % across both genders. The virus is primarily transmitted through saliva.2

Currently, the autophagy process during KSHV entry into host cells remains unclear. Additionally, there is no curative treatment or vaccine for KSHV infection, highlighting the importance of understanding early immune responses to KSHV entry. This understanding could potentially lead to new targets for antiviral therapies.

Researchers at the University of Zurich3 visualized the rapid activation of autophagy within minutes of KSHV entering host cells. The autophagy marker, cytosolic microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), was shown to co-localize with viral capsid proteins, signaling that the cell's defense machinery was engaging incoming viruses.

Through correlative confocal microscopy using the Thermo Scientific Helios 5 Hydra UX DualBeam (focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope - FIB-SEM) and reconstructed in Thermo Scientific Amira Software, scientists produced high-resolution 3D models revealing that KSHV particles reside within amphisomes, fusion vesicles formed between autophagosomes and endosomes. These structures indicate that cells actively target virus-damaged compartments for degradation.

The study identified galectin-8 and the receptor NDP52 as critical mediators of the autophagic response to KSHV. When the virus disrupts endosomal membranes, galectin-8 detects the damage and recruits NDP52, which in turn mobilizes autophagy machinery to degrade the infected vesicles.

Through quantitative co-localization analysis, the researchers were able to visualize and analyze molecular interactions, confirming that the galectin-8-NDP52 partnership is central to early antiviral defense.

 The integrative imaging workflow, linking confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, and image segmentation in Amira Software, was key to visualizing the sequence of molecular events that drive viral restriction. Amira Software enabled the team to:

These capabilities confirmed that selective autophagy serves as a rapid, effective antiviral defense, intercepting KSHV before infection is established.

The discovery that selective autophagy restricts KSHV infection through the recruitment of galectin-8 and NDP52 marks a significant step forward in understanding how cells defend themselves against viral invasion. With Amira Software, scientists can explore these complex biological processes in remarkable 3D detail, transforming visualization into a powerful tool for discovery.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Recreational athletes feel healthy but unhappy with their bodies","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251111/Recreational-athletes-feel-healthy-but-unhappy-with-their-bodies.aspx","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 00:59:00 GMT","

New research from Edith Cowan University (ECU) has revealed a striking disconnect between how recreational athletes perceive their health and fitness, and how they feel about their bodies. 

The research found that while 69 per cent of recreational athletes that participated in a survey considered themselves healthy and 62 per cent believed they were fit, only 26 per cent reported being satisfied with their body weight and shape. 

The findings confirm a concerning trend that athletes, particularly those engaged in regular or structured physical activity, are statistically more likely to experience disordered eating and exercise behaviors than their non-athlete counterparts, ECU's Dr. Valeria Varea said. 

""There is significant research available that shows athletes are at more risk of presenting with eating disorders, compared with non-athletes, particularly those who participate in sports that focus on lean bodies, such as gymnastics, or those that have weight categories."" 

Dr Varea and colleagues noted that 67 per cent of the recreational athletes that participated in the survey also reported feeling some level of anxiety or distress if they did not have access to food that they consider to be healthy, and 88 per cent reported feeling some guilt after eating food they consider to be unhealthy. 

Dr Varea said a focus on fueling the body could potentially translate into eating disorders such as Orthorexia Nervosa (ON), which is a fixation on righteous eating. People experiencing ON become anxious if they do not have access to their specific healthy foods, leading them to feel out of control. 

ON differs from anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders in the way that people who experience it are worried about the quality of the food, rather than the quantity. 

Some athletes are also at risk of Orthorexia Athletica (OA), which is characterised by the compulsive use and abuse of healthy food, and obsessive exercise, as athletes in essence, cross the line from a healthy approach to their eating and training, to an unhealthy obsession with both food and exercise. 

Vice Chancellor's Professorial Research Fellow Professor Dawn Penney affirmed the dual concerns at play. 

The simultaneous concerns with both quality of food and compulsive exercise are what distinguishes OA from ON where the concern is only with the quality of food. Athletes are regarded as a population group particularly at risk, with several sports and sporting cultures associated with regulated healthy eating regimes, high levels of training and/or a ""slim to win"" orientation.""

Professor Dawn Penney, Edith Cowan University

Adding to the complexity, however, is the fact that there is currently no medical diagnosis for either OA or ON, Dr Varea said. 

""There is no way for athletes or recreational exercisers to really know when they are crossing the boundary from healthy eating into ON, or from healthy exercise into OA."" 

Professor Penney said this only further highlighted the need for expanded approaches to education, particularly for everyday athletes participating at the peripheries of, or outside of formal club structures and support. 

""With diversification in how people engage in sport participation and how information about participation is communicated, there is a need for further research to explore how health education can be most effectively framed to minimise incidence and the risks associated with eating and exercise disorders for a broad spectrum of people,"" she said.

For years, the two patients had come to the Penn Memory Center at the University of Pennsylvania, where doctors and researchers follow people with cognitive impairment as they age, as well as a group with normal cognition.

Both patients, a man and a woman, had agreed to donate their brains after they died for further research. ""An amazing gift,"" said Edward Lee, the neuropathologist who directs the brain bank at the university's Perelman School of Medicine. ""They were both very dedicated to helping us understand Alzheimer's disease.""

The man, who died at 83 with dementia, had lived in the Center City neighborhood of Philadelphia with hired caregivers. The autopsy showed large amounts of amyloid plaques and tau tangles, the proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease, spreading through his brain.

Researchers also found infarcts, small spots of damaged tissue, indicating that he had suffered several strokes.

By contrast, the woman, who was 84 when she died of brain cancer, ""had barely any Alzheimer's pathology,"" Lee said. ""We had tested her year after year, and she had no cognitive issues at all.""

The man had lived a few blocks from Interstate 676, which slices through downtown Philadelphia. The woman had lived a few miles away in the suburb of Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, surrounded by woods and a country club.

The amount of air pollution she was exposed to — specifically, the level of fine particulate matter called PM2.5 — was less than half that of his exposure. Was it a coincidence that he had developed severe Alzheimer's while she had remained cognitively normal?

With increasing evidence that chronic exposure to PM2.5, a neurotoxin, not only damages lungs and hearts but is also associated with dementia, probably not.

""The quality of the air you live in affects your cognition,"" said Lee, the senior author of a recent article in JAMA Neurology, one of several large studies in the past few months to demonstrate an association between PM2.5 and dementia.

Scientists have been tracking the connection for at least a decade. In 2020, the influential Lancet Commission added air pollution to its list of modifiable risk factors for dementia, along with common problems like hearing loss, diabetes, smoking, and high blood pressure.

Yet such findings are emerging when the federal government is dismantling efforts by previous administrations to continue reducing air pollution by shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.

""'Drill, baby, drill' is totally the wrong approach,"" said John Balmes, a spokesperson for the American Lung Association who researches the effects of air pollution on health at the University of California-San Francisco.

""All these actions are going to decrease air quality and lead to increasing mortality and illness, dementia being one of those outcomes,"" Balmes said, referring to recent environmental moves by the White House.

Many factors contribute to dementia, of course. But the role of particulates — microscopic solids or droplets in the air — is drawing closer scrutiny.

Particulates arise from many sources: emissions from power plants and home heating, factory fumes, motor vehicle exhaust, and, increasingly, wildfire smoke.

Of the several particulate sizes, PM2.5 ""seems to be the most damaging to human health,"" Lee said, because it is among the smallest. Easily inhaled, the particles enter the bloodstream and circulate through the body; they can also travel directly from the nose to the brain.

The research at the University of Pennsylvania, the largest autopsy study to date of people with dementia, included more than 600 brains donated over two decades.

Previous research on pollution and dementia mostly relied on epidemiological studies to establish an association. Now, ""we're linking what we actually see in the brain with exposure to pollutants,"" Lee said, adding, ""We're able to do a deeper dive.""

The study participants had undergone years of cognitive testing at Penn Memory. With an environmental database, the researchers were able to calculate their PM2.5 exposure based on their home addresses.

The scientists also devised a matrix to measure how severely Alzheimer's and other dementias had damaged donors' brains.

Lee's team concluded that ""the higher the exposure to PM2.5, the greater the extent of Alzheimer's disease,"" he said. The odds of more severe Alzheimer's pathology at autopsy were almost 20% greater among donors who had lived where PM2.5 levels were high.

Another research team recently reported a connection between PM2.5 exposure and Lewy body dementia, which includes dementia related to Parkinson's disease. Generally considered the second most common type after Alzheimer's, Lewy body accounts for an estimated 5% to 15% of dementia cases.

In what the researchers believe is the largest epidemiological study to date of pollution and dementia, they analyzed records from more than 56 million beneficiaries with traditional Medicare from 2000 to 2014, comparing their initial hospitalizations for neurodegenerative diseases with their exposure to PM2.5 by ZIP codes.

""Chronic PM2.5 exposure was linked to hospitalization for Lewy body dementia,"" said Xiao Wu, an author of the study and a biostatistician at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.

After controlling for socioeconomic and other differences, the researchers found that the rate of Lewy body hospitalizations was 12% higher in U.S. counties with the worst concentrations of PM2.5 than in those with the lowest.

To help verify their findings, the researchers nasally administered PM2.5 to laboratory mice, which after 10 months showed ""clear dementia-like deficits,"" senior author Xiaobo Mao, a neuroscientist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, wrote in an email.

The mice got lost in mazes that they had previously dashed through. They had earlier built nests quickly and compactly; now their efforts were sloppy, disorganized. At autopsy, Mao said, their brains had atrophied and contained accumulations of the protein associated with Lewy bodies in human brains, called alpha-synuclein.

A third analysis, published this summer in The Lancet, included 32 studies conducted in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia. It also found ""a dementia diagnosis to be significantly associated with long-term exposure to PM2.5"" and to certain other pollutants.

Whether so-called ambient air pollution — the outdoor kind — increases dementia because of inflammation or other physiological causes awaits the next round of research.

Although air pollution has declined in the United States over two decades, scientists are calling for still stronger policies to promote cleaner air. ""People argue that air quality is expensive,"" Lee said. ""So is dementia care.""

President Donald Trump, however, reentered office vowing to increase the extraction and use of fossil fuels and to block the transition to renewable energy. His administration has rescinded tax incentives for solar installations and electric vehicles, Balmes noted, adding, ""They're encouraging continuing to burn coal for power generation.""

The administration has halted new offshore wind farms, announced oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, and moved to stop California's plan to transition to electric cars by 2035. (The state has challenged that action in court.)

""If policy goes in the opposite direction, with more air pollution, that's a big health risk for older adults,"" Wu said.

Last year, under the Biden administration, the Environmental Protection Agency set tougher annual standards for PM2.5, noting that ""the available scientific evidence and technical information indicate that the current standards may not be adequate to protect public health and welfare, as required by the Clean Air Act.""

In March, the EPA's new chairman announced that the agency would be ""revisiting"" those stricter standards.

Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) has demonstrated a new application for its cell-expansion bioreactor to advance tissue engineering and cell-based therapies for treatment of injuries and diseases.

SwRI scientists used the bioreactor to replicate induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) derived from adult skin, blood, and other somatic cells. Their pluripotent state allows iPSCs to differentiate into any other cell type in the body, much like embryonic stem cells but without the same ethical ambiguity. Large quantities of iPSCs are needed for regenerative medicine and individualized healthcare, but current technology requires manual production.

Using the SwRI-developed single-use 3D-printed bioreactor, we successfully harvested significant quantities of iPSCs. We are working on further differentiating those iPSCs into neural progenitor cells, which could support the regeneration of neurons that are damaged due to injury. International studies have shown that neural progenitor cells can repair the spinal cord when administered in the first 28 days following a spinal cord injury.""

Dr. Nick Mc Mahon,  Senior Research Scientist, leader on the project

SwRI's 3D printed bioreactor matrix boasts a larger surface-to-volume ratio compared to traditional 2D cell culture devices such as flasks or dishes, and it can grow more cells using an automated perfusion method. Due to the exceptional geometry of SwRI's bioreactor, cells maintain a monolayer without forming clusters during the cultivation process, minimizing the risk of spontaneous differentiation into the wrong type of cells.

""Since the discovery of iPSCs in the early 2000s, scientists have been exploring their potential to revolutionize medicine by using a patient's own cells to repair or replace damaged tissues to avoid immune rejection. Unlike embryonic stem cells, iPSCs pose no ethical controversy, making them a promising and responsible path toward personalized medicine,"" said Institute Engineer Dr. Jian Ling.

SwRI plans to further refine the prototype to advance automation and provide a simplified plug-and-play cell replication platform to accelerate the development of iPSC-based therapies.

This project received funding through SwRI's Internal Research and Development Program. In 2024, SwRI invested more than $11 million in tomorrow's technology to broaden its knowledge base, expand its reputation as a leader in science and technology and encourage its staff's professional development.

A major global trial shows that starting evolocumab early, before a first heart attack or stroke, lowers cardiovascular risk and strengthens the case for aggressive LDL cholesterol reduction in primary prevention.



Study: Evolocumab in Patients without a Previous Myocardial Infarction or Stroke. Image Credit: Lightspring / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers assessed whether adding the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab to standard therapy reduces first major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) compared with placebo in adults with atherosclerosis or high-risk diabetes but without previous myocardial infarction or stroke.

One in three adults will face heart disease, yet many have never suffered a heart attack or stroke. This raises a crucial question: could earlier, deeper low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering prevent that first cardiovascular crisis? PCSK9 inhibitors reduce LDL levels far more effectively than statins, but most supporting data come from patients with established cardiovascular disease. Investigators therefore explored whether initiating therapy earlier could improve outcomes, reduce the need for invasive procedures, and alleviate long-term health burdens.

Early lipid-lowering may not only prevent acute events but also lower rates of hospitalization and intensive care admissions. Clinicians, families, and policymakers are increasingly interested in whether the earlier use of PCSK9 inhibitors could help patients maintain their health, reduce procedural demand, and preserve quality of life. Future research must further define the long-term safety, equity, and cost-effectiveness of early PCSK9-based interventions.

This international, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial included adults at high cardiovascular risk without prior myocardial infarction or stroke. Eligible participants had atherosclerosis or high-risk diabetes, were on stable lipid-lowering therapy, and had LDL cholesterol of at least 90 mg/dl or equivalent non-HDL or apolipoprotein B thresholds. Participants were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either subcutaneous evolocumab 140 mg every two weeks or a matching placebo, stratified by region and baseline LDL cholesterol.

Investigators and participants remained blinded to assignment. Two primary endpoints were prespecified:

Three-point MACE: coronary heart disease death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke

Four-point MACE, the same, plus ischemia-driven arterial revascularization

A blinded TIMI Clinical Events Committee adjudicated all outcomes. Lipid substudies measured biochemical effects, and Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The study included 12,257 participants, excluding 44 due to site irregularities. Follow-up spanned a median of 4.5 years. The trial was funded by Amgen (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03872401).

Among 12,257 randomized participants (median age 66 years, 43% women), 6,129 received evolocumab and 6,128 received placebo. About two-thirds had qualifying atherosclerosis without prior events, and 59% had diabetes. The median baseline LDL cholesterol level was 122 mg/dL, and most participants received statins, with 68% at high intensity. Evolocumab reduced LDL cholesterol by 55% versus placebo at 48 weeks, yielding a median on-treatment LDL of 45 mg/dl.

Evolocumab significantly reduced the risk of first cardiovascular events. Three-point MACE occurred in 336 evolocumab patients and 443 placebo patients, with a 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of 6.2% versus 8.0% (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.65–0.86; P<0.001). The four-point MACE endpoint occurred in 747 versus 907 patients (13.4% vs 16.2%; HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.73–0.89; P<0.001). Key secondary outcomes, including myocardial infarction alone (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.52–0.79), also favored evolocumab. Mortality endpoints were exploratory but numerically lower in the evolocumab group.

Efficacy was consistent across age, sex, race, geography, baseline LDL cholesterol quartiles, and background use of statins or ezetimibe. Fine-Gray competing-risk analyses confirmed the robustness of the primary findings. Although most participants were White (93%), the treatment benefit appeared uniform. Safety profiles were comparable between groups, with no excess in serious adverse events or treatment discontinuations. The magnitude of benefit mirrored the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration (CTTC) projections relating LDL reduction to event risk.

Adding evolocumab to optimized background therapy significantly lowered the risk of first MACE in adults with atherosclerosis or high-risk diabetes who had not yet suffered a myocardial infarction or stroke. Benefits were consistent across key clinical subgroups and achieved without new safety signals.

These findings reinforce the concept of earlier, intensive LDL cholesterol lowering to prevent initial cardiovascular crises, reduce procedural interventions, and maintain functional independence for patients while easing the burden on healthcare systems.

A new review uncovers how the prized truffle's unique mix of antioxidants, polysaccharides, and sterols could make it more than a gourmet delicacy, positioning it as a potential ally in nutrition, medicine, and sustainable food innovation.



Bioactive Compounds and Antioxidant Potential of Truffles: A Comprehensive Review. Image Credit: kaicairone / Shutterstock

In a recent review published in the journal Antioxidants, researchers in Italy synthesized existing knowledge about the bioactive compounds in truffles and their biological properties. Their conclusions emphasize the potential of truffles as functional foods and natural sources of antioxidants.

The study also emphasizes the importance of advanced extraction and storage methods in preserving the bioactive integrity and quality.

Truffles, the underground fruiting bodies of ectomycorrhizal fungi, are valued for their aroma, rarity, and nutritional richness. The review examined species from the genera Tuber, Terfezia, Tirmania, and Picoa, which support rural economies and forest ecosystems across North America, North Africa, Europe, and Asia.

Beyond their culinary importance, truffles possess significant biochemical diversity, making them promising candidates for functional food and therapeutic applications.

Recent discoveries, including an endogenous endocannabinoid system and novel polysaccharides, expand their pharmacological relevance. Technological advances in extraction and preservation now enable their use in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical formulations, broadening their market scope beyond gastronomy.

Truffles are rich in carbohydrates and proteins but low in fats and fibers, providing essential minerals such as iron, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, and potassium. Their lipid fraction, although limited, is dominated by unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic and linoleic acids, and sterols like ergosterol and brassicasterol, which support antioxidant and cholesterol-lowering effects.

Structural polysaccharides, including β-glucans and heteropolysaccharides, exhibit immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties that are influenced by their molecular characteristics.

Phenolic compounds, such as cinnamic, coumaric, and gallic acids, and flavonoids like kaempferol and catechin, confer strong antioxidant capacity.

Desert truffles (Terfezia, Tirmania, Picoa) are richer in vitamin C, folate, vitamin E, and β-carotene, while European black and white truffles contribute B-vitamins and vitamin D precursors derived from ergosterol.

Notably, Tuber melanosporum contains the endocannabinoid anandamide, which may act as an olfactory attractant for mammal-mediated spore dispersal.

Truffles offer high-quality, digestible proteins that contain all essential amino acids, with glutamate and sulfur-containing amino acids contributing to their distinctive umami flavor.

Bioactive peptides exhibit antioxidant, antihypertensive, and immune-regulatory effects. The characteristic aroma arises from volatile sulfur compounds, such as bis(methylthio)methane in white truffles and 1-octen-3-ol in black truffles, combined with aldehydes, ketones, and phenolic derivatives responsible for distinctive earthy or garlicky notes.

Truffle extracts exhibit a diverse range of biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective, and anticancer effects. Terfezia claveryi extracts show hepatoprotective activity against CCl₄-induced toxicity, while certain Tuber and Terfezia species demonstrate anticancer properties via caspase-3 activation and HER2 oncogene suppression.

Additionally, truffle-derived compounds reduce oxidative stress, inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria, and protect hepatic and neural tissues through immune enhancement and the induction of apoptosis.



Bioactivities and health-promoting properties of truffles. Schematic representation of the main biological activities attributed to truffles and their bioactive compounds. Truffle-derived molecules, including polysaccharides, polyphenols, sterols, carotenoids, and terpenoids, exert multiple health-promoting effects. These properties include antimicrobial/antiviral activity, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, hepatoprotective functions, and antitumor potential. Such pleiotropic effects highlight the relevance of truffles not only as culinary delicacies but also as promising sources of nutraceutical and therapeutic agents. 

Preserving truffle bioactivity depends on efficient extraction and storage processes. Conventional solvent and Soxhlet extractions often expose heat-sensitive compounds, such as phenolics and volatiles, to degradation.

Modern green extraction methods, including ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), pressurized liquid extraction (PLE), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), and supercritical CO₂ extraction, enhance yield and purity while preserving antioxidant and sterol content. UAE and enzymatic pretreatment optimize polysaccharide recovery, whereas PLE efficiently isolates β-glucans and ergosterol under mild conditions.

Analytical techniques, such as headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME), enable the non-destructive identification of volatile compounds while maintaining their chemical integrity.

Post-harvest storage significantly impacts truffle composition and shelf life. Low-temperature storage and freezing slow spoilage but may alter aromatic compounds. Lyophilization best preserves bioactivity when combined with antioxidants or cryoprotectants.

Modified atmosphere packaging and edible coatings, such as chitosan or gum Arabic, minimize oxidation and microbial growth. Encapsulation using β- or γ-cyclodextrin and nano/microcarriers stabilizes volatile and antioxidant compounds. 

Gentle technologies, including irradiation and high-pressure processing, extend freshness without compromising chemical integrity, ensuring truffles remain viable for food, nutraceutical, and pharmaceutical applications.

Due to their antimutagenic, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory properties, truffles are gaining traction in the formulation of dietary supplements, dairy-based functional foods, and beverages.

Their extracts are increasingly utilized in cosmetics and perfumery due to their antioxidant and aromatic profiles. While most data are preclinical, future clinical trials and standardized extraction protocols will be crucial for validating therapeutic claims and ensuring reproducibility across products.

As demand increases, sustainability is critical, particularly for wild species such as Tuber magnatum, which face overharvesting pressures. Promoting sustainable cultivation practices, integrating traditional ecological knowledge, and advancing bioengineering approaches are essential for long-term viability.

Future research should focus on optimizing extraction and encapsulation technologies to enhance bioavailability and stability. 

Ultimately, truffles represent not only gourmet delicacies but also emerging functional foods with potential preventive and therapeutic applications across the food, nutraceutical, and pharmaceutical industries.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","NFL owner splashes record $165million to become league's newest franchise","https://talksport.com/us/3725995/nfl-owner-arthur-blank-buys-nwsl-expansion-atlanta-falcons/","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 09:05:00 GMT","





Arthur Blank has just added to his already-impressive sports portfolio after being awarded the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL)'s latest franchise. 

With Boston and Denver being awarded women's soccer franchises in 2023 and 2025, respectively - both of whom will enter the NWSL for their inaugural seasons in 2026 - Atlanta is the latest city to get involved as the sport continues to see growth. 

However, this has come at quite the cost, with Blank's AMB Sports + Entertainment - having to fork out an estimated $165 million record expansion fee to become the 17th team to join the league, and the seventh since 2021. 

AMB Sports + Entertainment is also the holding company of the NFL's Atlanta Falcons and MLS franchise Atlanta United FC, as well as the Mercedes-Benz Stadium, where its new NWSL franchise will play their home games. 

Blank, 83, who made his wealth as a co-founder of Home Depot, also owns the Atlanta Drive Golf Club - a Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy-led advanced tech TGL golf league - and the PGA TOUR Superstore. 

""We have had productive engagement with NWSL and others in its stakeholder group on the possibility of bringing an expansion franchise to Atlanta,"" a spokesperson for AMB Sports + Entertainment said, per The Athletic. 

""We have nothing to announce currently as those conversations are ongoing.""

Although an exact date to join the league is currently unknown, with the final details still yet needing to be ironed out, Atlanta's team is expected to debut sometime after the 2026 NWSL campaign.

This would follow the trend of that of the league's 16th expansion team Denver Summit FC, after they were given the green light to join on January 30, 2025 for a then-record fee worth $110 million. 

This was over double that of 15th expansion team Boston Legacy's joining fee of $53 million - which USC women's basketball star JuJu Watkins has recently invested in - as has provided empirical support for the rate of growth which women's soccer, and women's sports in general, is seeing.

NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman announced in September that the league would shift away from formal bidding processes to a rolling expansion process. 

At the time, per ESPN, she said: ""We've made the decision to shift to a rolling process mostly because we've been through this, two rounds, and so, we pretty much know the universe of who's interested. 

""There's more than a dozen of them. Those conversations are ongoing. 

""Each of them has a different perspective on how much time they need to launch, the investments they need to make to be successful, including potentially around infrastructure, and we want to not force a square peg into a round hole.""

With huge demand for owning a NWSL franchise, Berman also boldly stated that there is ""no reason"" why they can't grow the league to 32 teams like that in the NFL. 

She further doubled-down on the league's future growth, announcing that there are plans for a second division to be launched in 2027, like that of the Women's Super League (WSL) and WSL2 at the top of the soccer pyramid across the pond in England.

It appears to be a great time for a market like Atlanta to join the NWSL, with it reportedly being the seventh-largest TV media market in the States, according to Nielsen data. 

The Mercedes-Benz Stadium - the new team's future home - is no stranger to hosting soccer games either, with it also being the home of Atlanta's MLS side, accommodating 42,500 spectators.

The stadium, which also hosts the Falcons, is expandable to accommodate up to 75,000 spectators, though, with it having hosted Super Bowl LIII in 2019, as Tom Brady, Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13-3. 

As it pertains to women's soccer, though, the retractable roof multi-purpose stadium was last in use in 2024 when it hosted the SheBelieves Cup, comprised of the national teams from Brazil, Canada, Japan and the United States. 

The league now houses 17 teams, with further expansion expected in the future

USWNT midfielder and Portland Thorns captain Sam Coffey was asked about the possibility of Atlanta getting a women's NWSL team back in 2024, where she said: “I think it would be a great market for one with Atlanta United here and now with U.S. Soccer starting to plant some roots here.

""I think it would be a great place to bring a team. It's an amazing city... I think it could do really well here.""

The U.S. Soccer Federation announced that it was relocating its headquarters and training center to a brand new facility in Georgia back in 2023, with Blank donating $50 million to the project.

Whilst it is still currently under construction, it is expected to be fully completed ahead of the FIFA men's World Cup which takes place across the United States, Canada and Mexico in 2026.

Ricardo Pepi (9) and Folarin Balogun (20) enter USMNT camp in solid scoring form Elizabeth Kruetz / ISI Photos / USSF / Getty Images

CHESTER, Pa. — Ricardo Pepi popped out of a black SUV on Monday afternoon in Philadelphia, and when he settled into U.S. men's national team camp for the first time in 2025, at long last, the USMNT had what looks like a full set of strikers.

It is not, to be clear, a full arsenal of attacking weapons. The squad is depleted. Christian Pulisic, Tim Weah, Malik Tillman, Weston McKennie and others are back in Europe, regaining fitness or otherwise omitted from the U.S. roster for friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay.

Advertisement

But Pepi, fresh off a Champions League goal — and three in his last five games in all competitions for PSV — is here.

Folarin Balogun, the presumed starting No. 9, with three goals in his last four games at Monaco, is here.

Haji Wright, who scored twice last month for the U.S. against Australia, and who sits third in the English Championship goal-getting stakes with eight for table-topping Coventry City, is here.

They trained together Tuesday, in frigid conditions on the banks of the Delaware River, for the first time since the summer of 2024. And suddenly, for the first time in ages, striker is one of the USMNT's stronger positions.

For most of the past decade, it has been a weakness. A hole to be filled. A problem to solve. Since Gregg Berhalter took charge of the USMNT in 2019, 16 men have started up top for the national team. None seized the position with two feet and two hands.

Last November, though, Pepi seemed to seize it. And while he was out recovering from injuries earlier this fall, Balogun seemed to seize it. And when Wright got his shot in October, he seized it.

Balogun's goals against Japan and Ecuador, followed by Wright's against Australia, marked the first time since 2020-21 that the USMNT has gotten goals from its No. 9 in three consecutive games. (The previous streak was compiled by Nicholas Gioacchini, Sebastian Soto, Ayo Akinola and Jesús Ferreira.)

Excluding January friendlies, the drought stretched all the way back to the 2019 Gold Cup (Gyasi Zardes and Jozy Altidore). Berhalter spent years reaching for and trialing players who simply didn't belong at the international level. As a core coalesced in midfield and wide areas, the top of the field remained an area of concern, and a void that seemingly held the U.S. back.

Now, at least temporarily in November, the script has flipped.

There are no true wingers on this USMNT roster, but up top, head coach Mauricio Pochettino has options.

One of those options could be a 3-5-2 formation that pairs Balogun with Wright or Pepi in a front two — with Max Arfsten at left wingback, Sergiño Dest at right wingback, and some combination of three central midfielders.

The USMNT has not yet played like that under Pochettino. But it had success with a back three in September and October. Pochettino and players have spoken about the benefits of developing tactical flexibility. And with Pulisic (plus others) absent but all the strikers present, the shape could suit this month's personnel.

“I'm comfortable playing as a one or a two,” Balogun told The Athletic on Tuesday. He spent some of his youth as a winger, and has occasionally played alongside a strike partner at his French clubs, Reims and Monaco.

Wright also said Tuesday that he's “comfortable all across the front line.” He, too, has played as a left winger in a front three, a striker in a two and a striker in a three.

“Tactically, things are obviously different when you're playing as a lone striker as opposed to playing with two, or playing on the wing,” Wright said. “Defensive responsibilities are different across all the different positions, so you kind of have to adjust tactically, and your state of mind.”

Which is why the experience at club level matters, and why different alignments could be options for the U.S. this month.

The 3-5-2 probably will not be the preferred shape at the World Cup next summer. But Pulisic currently plays in a front two at AC Milan. Weah now has plenty of experience at wingback. If flexibility is prized, and if Pochettino wants to get something close to his best 11 players on the field, it could be a changeup to throw at opponents.

Or, perhaps, the benefit of having Balogun, Wright and Pepi together is competition. If it's a battle for one spot in a starting 11 next summer, that, too, is a good thing.

“Whenever we have the whole team, we're a stronger force,” Balogun said.

“At the end of the day, we have to all do what we can to [earn] the starting position,” he later added. “Haji played a great game against Australia. Pepi's coming in and he'll look to get minutes as well. There's definitely competition. That's part of playing elite level sports, playing for your country.”

Mauricio Pochettino's assistants have been busy racking up some airline miles lately.

Over two weekends in late October and early November, they fanned out across the U.S. to watch a half-dozen World Cup hopefuls perform for their club teams in the MLS Cup playoffs.

Jesus Perez, the top lieutenant for the U.S. men's national team coach, was in Texas for FC Dallas vs. Vancouver Whitecaps and Austin FC vs. LAFC. Miguel D'Agostino saw games in New York and Seattle before wrapping up in Columbus, Ohio. 

And later this month, it'll be off to Europe. D'Agostino, Perez and goalkeeper coach Toni Jimenez will spend the next several months crisscrossing the continent to keep track of the Americans' overseas-based stars.

It's all part of the process of making sure nothing is overlooked, no stone left unturned before May, when Pochettino must name the country's final 26-man roster for the biggest World Cup in history.

The lineup for the Americans' World Cup opener on June 12 in Los Angeles is likely to have familiar names. The midfield duo of Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie. Star forwards Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah up top. 

But the last few decisions won't be easy, as the player pool is significantly deeper than it was even a year ago. Last November, the likes of left-back Max Arfsten, right-back Alex Freeman and goalkeeper Matt Freese didn't have a single cap. Now, all of three are projected to comfortably make the World Cup cut and, in Freese's case, be a starter when the curtain goes up on the biggest stage in sports next summer.

""Not being arrogant, I think we are a coaching staff that has the capacity to improve players,"" Pochettino told me this week. ""Not only young players who are between 18 and 21, but even someone like [38-year-old U.S. captain] Tim Ream. 

""Because you can always improve. I think that is our talent: we like to — and we are able to — make players better.""

Pochettino's track record speaks for itself. 

During a 16-year coaching career that included stints managing some of the world's biggest clubs, Pochettino earned a reputation for development. He fielded more than 50 academy graduates during spells at Espanyol, Southampton, Tottenham, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea.

Seventeen players that he managed at club level debuted for England's national team. His 2017-18 Tottenham side had nine representatives reach at least the semis of the 2018 World Cup, more than any other team. The last two World Cup-winning captains (Hugo Lloris and Lionel Messi) and the leading scorer at both events (Harry Kane and Kylian Mbappe) worked under Pochettino at the time.

But helping players reach new heights as an international boss is significantly more challenging.

""We spent every single day with guys at the clubs we worked at,"" Pochettino told me. ""Here, it's about how you have influence in a very short period. At some point, we have to help them in an emotional way. The important thing is to connect them with their talent, for them to feel free, and when they arrive in the national team it's an environment where they're going to be happy.""

Pochettino hasn't been able to spend more than a few days at a time on the training field with European-based standouts like Pulisic and McKennie. Injuries to other regulars, including Adams, striker Ricardo Pepi – along with full-back duo Sergino Dest and Antonee ""Jedi"" Robinson – have further reduced those opportunities.

Their absences also opened the door for others.

Take Freeman. The son of Super Bowl winner Antonio Freeman wasn't even invited to January camp. But then the 21-year-old strung together a number of fine performances in his first season as a starter for Orlando City. He earned a look and took his chance, logging every minute of the Gold Cup. He also went the full 90 minutes in the USMNT's 2-1 win over Australia last month. 

""Everything could be different if Sergiño arrived in a better condition in June, and we don't send him back [home],"" Perez told me. ""If Sergiño was there, maybe Alex Freeman doesn't play. This is a world of opportunities. But you need to be ready.""

Freeman didn't land on Pochettino's radar by accident. He and his assistants visited more than 50 clubs during their first year at the helm. They leaned on people like former U.S. assistants B.J. Callaghan and Nico Estévez, now the head coaches with MLS teams Nashville SC and Austin FC, respectively, who knew intimately both the domestic league and USMNT pool. 

Every time Pochettino or his assistants spoke to a coach or sporting director, they wanted to know the same thing: Which players in your group do you think can reach the next level?

""If we go back 13 months,"" Perez told me, ""That question helped some guys to be in the national team today.""

Discussions with officials at top European clubs are just as important. Possibly more, such as the case with Pulisic.

""I remember one conversation in Milan,"" Perez told me. ""The [AC Milan] coach at that time said to me, ‘I feel Christian shines if he's in this space, doing this role.' For me, it was important to translate to Mauricio. 

""I'm not saying we take 100 percent of what they say,"" Perez added. ""But these guys are professionals like us. It's super valuable that our colleagues give us their opinion. Then we consider it and evaluate it. I think in soccer, like in life, you have to be humble enough to listen to everyone and then make your own choices.""

When a player is given a chance, he must perform to keep his place.

""We identified in these guys that there was the potential to improve,"" Pochettino told me in reference to Arfsten, Freeman, Freese and others. ""When you compare players that were in the last World Cup to Freeman or Max, who started to play with us less than one year ago, now they match the quality of the players in Europe. That is evident. It's obvious that they're now at the same level.""

Freese might be the best example. The Harvard graduate didn't appear in the January wins over Venezuela and Costa Rica. But he won the Gold Cup job over 2022 World Cup starter Matt Turner and has now been in the lineup for 10 consecutive matches. In just a few months, he progressed from international novice to Pochettino's clear No. 1 keeper. 

""It allows me to kind of play like myself,"" Freese said during availability on Monday when asked how much the confidence shown by Jimenez and Pochettino has helped his game. ""I consistently just want to repay that trust.""

With Jedi sidelined indefinitely with his knee injury, Arfsten is all but certain to add to the 14 U.S. caps he's already won in 2025. 

""I do think I've improved this year, just in all aspects of the game,"" Arfsten said in a group on Tuesday. ""Being involved in these camps and having our coaching staff here express belief in me, and give me advice on certain things, has definitely helped me become more confident. I think it's helped me grow as a player a lot.""

Room for more growth remains. Plenty of work does, too. The USMNT won't gather for another four months when the year's final camp breaks on Nov. 20. When they convene again in late March, the World Cup will be just around the corner.

""That is a massive challenge for us,"" Pochettino told me. ""But after one year, we know all the players. And they have started to understand what we want. So we're very excited, and we're convinced that we are going to arrive at the World Cup in a very good place.""

Nashville SC defender Walker Zimmerman is out of contract and will depart the club this winter, sources briefed on the situation told The Athletic.

Zimmerman is a club legend, a cornerstone from the club's inaugural match. He twice won MLS Defender of Year while in Nashville (2020, 2021) and will be one of the top defenders on the free agency market this winter.

Zimmerman led the club to the playoffs in five of the club's first six seasons and lifted Nashville's first trophy this year, the U.S. Open Cup.

— Tom Bogert (@tombogert) October 2, 2025



The 32-year-old signed a contract extension in 2022 making him a designated player, a kind of deal rare for a defender and one that underpinned his quality and importance to the team.

Zimmerman has made 172 appearances for Nashville, fifth-most in the club's short MLS history.

He has 46 caps for the U.S. men's national team, appearing in all four of his country's matches at the 2022 World Cup. Injuries slowed him a bit this year, but he was with the national team in the summer for the Gold Cup.

Zimmerman missed time this year due to a concussion, knee issue and national team duty, making 26 appearances across all competitions for Nashville. The club's season ended last weekend at the hands of Inter Miami in a 4-0 Game 3 defeat in the opening round of the playoffs.

Prior to being traded to Nashville ahead of 2020, Zimmerman started his career with FC Dallas and then was part of LAFC's first few years. He won the 2016 Supporters' Shield and U.S. Open Cup with Dallas, then the Shield with LAFC in 2019.

The departure opens up a DP spot for Nashville. The club has the flexibility to add a DP or open an additional U-22 initiative slot.

England international Reece James called out the weather and pitch conditions in the United States ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

James and Chelsea won the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the U.S. this past summer. The club captain made five appearances in the expanded competition, getting some first-hand experience of what the summer conditions would be like come 2026. 

Describing the “difficult” conditions, the 25-year-old insisted England are keeping the weather in mind when preparing for the tournament.

“It's been a key message that the conditions will be tough in the middle of the summer in America. Everyone is aware of that. We're trying to prepare as best we can for that,” James told assembled media at England's press conference on Wednesday.

“It's super difficult conditions to play in that heat. Especially for us playing in England, there's not anything like that before. Once you are out there you adapt the longer you are there, when you are settled in one place and try to limit the things you can.”

James revealed England plan on arriving to the U.S. early to get themselves acclimated to the environment.

Even more concerning was James restarting the pitch conditions conversation with less than seven months to go until the World Cup.

“The pitches when we were there weren't the greatest either and made it a little bit harder. But hopefully by the time the World Cup comes around it's better,” James admitted, though he did not specify which stadiums were of concern.

Chelsea played at four different stadiums in the Club World Cup, three of which will be in use at the 2026 international tournament.

The right back is not the first player in recent history to question the playing surfaces in the U.S., especially among Club World Cup competitors. Former Palmeiras player, Estêvão, also called out the pitch conditions at MetLife Stadium in their group stage match against Porto. The stadium is set to host the World Cup final. 

MetLife historically is a controversial venue for its synthetic turf. The eye-raising amount of season-ending injuries suffered in the NFL at the stadium raised concern initially, but natural grass was installed for the Club World Cup as required by FIFA. Still, the changes seem to be substandard in players' minds.

Argentina's Emiliano Martínez and Lionel Scaloni also denounced pitch conditions during the 2024 Copa América when they played at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Reece James speaks out on Donald Trump's controversial ceremony tactics after England snub","https://www.themirror.com/sport/soccer/reece-james-donald-trump-england-1500165","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:23:00 GMT","

Reece James has joked he'll avoid another awkward trophy presentation with Donald Trump if the opportunity arises next summer with England.

The US President's unexpected appearance at Chelsea's Club World Cup celebrations went viral following last summer's tournament. The Chelsea captain was on stage as Trump inserted himself into the presentation ceremony before Cole Palmer visibly reacted to the spectacle.

However, James laughed off the incident, insisting that if a similar situation occurred and England lifted the World Cup next summer, he would let Harry Kane handle it. The England defender smiled: ""No, I don't have a plan. I'll leave that to Harry!""

Trump attended as FIFA's special guest at the Club World Cup final last summer when Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain to claim the trophy at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, which will also host next year's final.

James captained Chelsea to victory in July and confesses he's hoping to replicate that achievement with England at the World Cup next summer, reports the Mirror.

James said:

""It's my dream, every young boy or girl's dream to be a world champion for their country. It's something I've dreamt of since I started playing, since I got selected for England. I feel we could go close.

""I don't think it's related that much. Club football and international football are slightly different. It's one year apart, a completely different squad, but we'll do our best.""

James is confident that leadership, team spirit, and healthy competition are the key elements for success, and he's enjoyed working under his former Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, who now manages England.

He further stated:

""I think I know what I bring. There are many experienced players here, there are a lot of young players. I think the stronger we are as a group, the easier it is. The key to achieving what we want and getting success is having the group's togetherness – it's not one person's leadership.

""Competition is key to going close to winning things. In competitions you can't have a small squad. They need to keep players on their toes with everyone hungry and fire in their belly to want to win.""

Despite Trump's odd interruption last summer, it didn't overshadow Chelsea's accomplishment, which held immense personal significance for James. ""It's amazing for me. Since a little boy I supported this team,"" he expressed at the time.

""I just wanted to play for this club just once. That would have been enough for me. To captain the team and lead them to two trophies this season has been a dream for me.""

Trump was front and centre as James lifted the Club World Cup for Chelsea

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Reece James joked he is happy to sidestep a second meeting with Donald Trump and leave Harry Kane with the US President should England fulfil their World Cup dreams next summer.

The Chelsea captain found himself in the spotlight in July after Enzo Maresca's Blues shocked Champions League holders Paris Saint-Germain to win the Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium.

Trump presented James with the trophy alongside Fifa president Gianni Infantino, whose suggestion that the US President moved out the way for the ensuing celebrations was ignored.

There was bemusement among the delighted Blues, including their skipper who will gladly leave the trophy presentation to England captain Kane should they win the World Cup.

Asked if he has a plan regarding Trump should they triumph next summer, full-back James said with a smile: “I don't have a plan. I'll leave that to Harry.

“It's my dream, every young boy or girl's dream, to be a world champion for their country.

“It's something I've dreamt of since I started playing, since I got selected for England. I feel we could go close.”

James has also issued a warning to his England teammates of ""super difficult conditions"" at the World Cup having experienced intense summer heat during Chelsea's Club World Cup campaign.

The defender played through conditions at both ends of the extreme weather spectrum, tasked with dealing with a heatwave in Philadelphia as well as thunderstorms in Charlotte.

He said: ""Everyone is aware of that. We are trying to prepare as best we can for that. It's super difficult conditions to play in that heat. Especially for us playing in England, there's not anything like that before.

""You feel the heat the minute you step outside the hotel. Once you are out there you adapt the longer you are there, when you are settled in one place and try to limit the things you can. Later kick-offs when it's not so hot and humid, that would definitely help.”

Temperatures in New Jersey, where Chelsea beat Paris St-Germain in the Club World Cup final, reached 38C during the tournament

England defender Reece James is hoping Fifa will consider moving kick-off times for next year's World Cup to help players deal with potentially stifling summer temperatures.  

The United States, Canada and Mexico are co-hosting the tournament, which starts 11 June, but concerns have been raised over the extreme heat conditions teams will likely face. 

James, 25, captained Chelsea to victory in the Club World Cup this summer in the US but the competition faced criticism because of the severe conditions, with the defender's team-mate Enzo Fernandez saying he felt ""dizzy"" while playing in ""very dangerous"" heat. 

""It's super difficult conditions to play in that heat, especially us playing in England - there's not anything like that before,"" said James.

'Heat danger' warning about 2026 World Cup venues

Research led by Queen's University Belfast found the temperatures at 14 of the 16 stadiums being used for the 2026 World Cup could exceed potentially dangerous levels during the tournament. 

Philadelphia, which is one of the US cities hosting matches, was under a severe heat warning during one of Chelsea's training sessions this summer when temperatures reached 37C but because of the 45% humidity conditions felt more like 45C. 

England, who have qualified for the tournament with two games to spare, would benefit from later kick-offs when temperatures have cooled, according to manager Thomas Tuchel.

""For sure, that would definitely help,"" said James, ""later kick-offs when it's not so hot and humid. That would definitely help.""

England are planning a warm-weather training camp in Florida to help acclimatise for the tournament and will also build a ""heat-proof"" game plan, said assistant Anthony Barry. 

Asked if football's world governing body has contacted him for feedback after the Club World Cup, James added: ""No, I haven't been asked about my thoughts on kick-off times.

""I'm sure they will have asked someone. Maybe managers or people at the clubs. I'm sure they will have got some feedback.""

Fifa is likely to schedule World Cup matches involving major European nations after midnight UK time in an effort to combat heat issues.

It is anticipated these kick-off times will mirror those at the Club World Cup, when the earliest games started at 17:00 BST, followed by 20:00, 23:00 and 02:00.

""You feel the heat the minute you step outside the hotel. The conditions are super hot,"" James continued. 

""Once you are out there you adapt the longer you are there, when you are settled in once place and try to limit the things you can.

""The pitches when we were there weren't the greatest either and made it a little bit harder but hopefully by the time the World Cup comes around hopefully it's better.""

England defender Reece James said his teammates must brace for “super difficult conditions” at the 2026 World Cup in North America having experienced intense summer heat during Chelsea's Club World Cup campaign earlier this year.

James, who captained Chelsea at the Club World Cup held in the United States from June 14 to July 13, playing through a heatwave in Philadelphia and thunderstorms in Charlotte, said England are readying for the World Cup heat next summer.

The 48-team showpiece event will feature 104 matches across 16 host cities in Canada, Mexico and the United States. Dallas, Houston, Miami, Atlanta, Monterrey, and Guadalajara, where June and July temperatures often exceed 33°C (91°F), will be tough to endure.

“Everyone is aware of that. We are trying to prepare as best we can for that. It's super difficult conditions to play in that heat. Especially for us playing in England, there's not anything like that before,” James told reporters on Tuesday.

“You feel the heat the minute you step outside the hotel. Once you are out there you adapt the longer you are there, when you are settled in one place and try to limit the things you can. Later kick-offs when it's not so hot and humid, that would definitely help.

Matches in venues such as Vancouver, Seattle, San Francisco and Toronto are expected to offer milder conditions at next year's finals. However, the 25-year-old James noted that poor pitch quality compounded the weather challenges.

“The pitches when we were there weren't the greatest either and made it a little bit harder but hopefully by the time the World Cup comes around it's better,” he added.

England host Serbia on Thursday and visit Albania on Sunday in their last two World Cup qualifiers.

Sixteen stadiums across the United States, Canada and Mexico will host the FIFA World Cup in 2026, and the University of Tennessee at Knoxville is leading the research to ensure turf quality is pristine and consistent across all 104 matches next summer.

John Sorochan, a distinguished professor of turfgrass sciences and management at UT, said the university is in the ""11th hour"" of research as his team of faculty members, technicians and students prepare for the ultimate test after putting their work into practice earlier this year at the Club World Cup.

Sorochan, who's collaborating with Michigan State University, joined Knox News on an exclusive tour at the East Tennessee AgResearch and Education Center-Plant Sciences Unit, where FIFA has built a covered facility to replicate the conditions of five domed stadiums hosting the 2025 FIFA World Cup between June 11 and July 19.

Growing sod on plastic lets it develop roots, allowing UT and the growers to easily roll up the sod and place it in stadiums faster. This reduces stress on the grass and keeps growers from cutting the roots. Artificial fibers make up about 5% of the sod and provide stability as the grass grows, and each sod plot is about 2 inches thick. When combined with other technology to create a ""shallow pitch,"" the sod can be assembled and disassembled in under 12 hours both ways. “We've come up with something that you can put in a temporary surface and still play at the highest quality level,” Sorochan said.

UT uses LED grow lights to simulate how turf will grow inside the five domed stadiums in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles and Vancouver. Sorochan and his team have tested how long the lights need to be shining − about 12 hours for a full field − and when they need to be turned on. The color of lighting is important, as various color wavelengths produce varying levels of energy. Blue sends out more energy in shorter waves to produce short, sturdy growth, while red is used as a stimulus whose longer waves help grass grow lusher.

Sorochan and research associate Kyley Dickson developed the fLEX machine after an NFL game set for Mexico City had to be relocated in 2018 because the field was deemed unsafe. Sorochan returned from the experience annoyed but inspired to find a way to test fields based on how athletes will come into contact with the ground while playing, including how cleats affect turf. “We developed a machine that would simulate a foot strike,"" he said. ""I gave the charge to Kyley, and we sat and brainstormed over what would it need to look like and do all that. And we engineered a foot that would strike the surface to measure the compliance of the surface. We put all sorts of sensors in it.” Sorochan used fLEX in the FIFA research, and several NFL teams now benefit from the technology. He sold the machine earlier this year to SGL System, a Norwegian company that develops grow lights.

Sorochan points out how his team took warm-season Bermuda grass and overseeded it with cool-season ryegrass, allowing the ryegrass to sprout up and act as a stabilizer − similar to how artificial fibers are used in the sod grown on plastic. UT found success using Bermuda grass for the Club World Cup and plans to use it again for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in specific climates, though most soccer pitches are Kentucky Bluegrass. Michigan State University, FIFA and UT will inform teams about the varying playing surfaces throughout the tournament, Sorochan said.

Dillon McCallum, lead technician for the FIFA research, was working for a country club when he showed an interest in turf. His boss pointed him to Sorochan, and McCallum arrived at UT to study for his master's degree in turfgrass pathology. “If I could have told myself sophomore year of college that I was going to be working on a project that was helping assist the organization in putting on the FIFA World Cup, I would have said, 'That's crazy' and 'That sounds perfect,'"" he said.

When Sorochan, UT and FIFA install the turf at stadiums, they have a couple of options: the shallow pitch, left, or the slightly elevated one atop six inches of sand shown to the right. There's a layer of a geotextile fabric called Permavoid underneath that manages how water drains from the turf. For the shallow pitch, this layer gives grass the room sand would normally provide. Extra sand will be used for stadiums that require irrigation systems and sprinkler heads to run throughout the field. Turf at Neyland Stadium, for comparison, sits on about one foot of sand, Sorochan said.

Jumping on the turf is fun, sure, but it also illustrates the real reason behind the research − to make the playing surface feel consistent for players no matter where they're playing during the FIFA World Cup. If you were to jump on the different types of turf at UT like I did, you wouldn't be able to tell a difference between them. The consistency is important for player safety, but it also ensures athletes are able to compete at the highest level − and on a level playing field − by minimizing outside factors like torn-up turf. This is why FIFA brought in UT to help with the World Cup and why they plan to keep working together in years to come.

Reece James says he will avoid another awkward trophy ceremony with Donald Trump if the opportunity arises next summer with England. The US President's intrusion into Chelsea's Club World Cup celebrations became an internet sensation following last summer's events.

Chelsea captain James found himself on stage as Trump inserted himself into the presentation ceremony before Cole Palmer grimaced at the spectacle. However, James chuckled as he declared that if it occurred again and England captured the World Cup next summer, he would delegate the situation to Harry Kane.

England defender James grinned: ""No, I don't have a plan. I'll leave that to Harry!""Trump served as FIFA's honored guest at the Club World Cup final last summer when Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain to claim the trophy at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, where next year's championship match will take place.

James guided Chelsea to victory in July and confesses he is fantasizing about duplicating that triumph with England in the World Cup next summer, reports The Mirror. 



James declared: ""It's my dream, every young boy or girl's dream to be a world champion for their country. It's something I've dreamt of since I started playing, since I got selected for England. I feel we could go close.

""I don't think it's related that much. Club football and international football are slightly different. It's one year apart, a completely different squad, but we'll do our best.""

James credits leadership, team spirit, and healthy competition as the key factors for success, and he appreciates working under his former Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, who is now England's manager.



He further stated: ""I think I know what I bring. There are many experienced players here, there are a lot of young players.

""I think the stronger we are as a group, the easier it is. The key to achieving what we want and getting success is having the group's togetherness – it's not one person's leadership.

""Competition is key to going close to winning things. In competitions you can't have a small squad.

""They need to keep players on their toes with everyone hungry and fire in their belly to want to win.""



Despite Trump's strange interruption last summer, James remained focused on Chelsea's achievement, which held immense personal significance for him.

""It's amazing for me. Since a little boy I supported this team,"" he expressed at that time.

""I just wanted to play for this club just once. That would have been enough for me.

""To captain the team and lead them to two trophies this season has been a dream for me.""

The draw for the 2026 World Cup will take place on Friday, 5 December at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC, at 17:00 GMT (12:00 local time).

It will be the biggest World Cup yet, with 48 nations taking part - an expansion from 32.

The three host countries qualify automatically, while nations from other confederations have their own qualifying campaigns.

The first ever Fifa Peace Prize will also be awarded by the organisation's president Gianni Infantino on the day of the draw. 

The 2026 World Cup will take place in the USA, Mexico and Canada, between 11 June-19 July.

The 48 participating teams will be placed into pots based on Fifa rankings and confederation constraints.

The teams will be divided into four pots of 12 teams. Each group will have one team drawn from each pot.

Pot one includes the host nations and the nine top countries in the Fifa world rankings.

Pots two, three and four will include the next-best ranked teams - so in theory, each group should be balanced. 

The teams representing the host counties will be assigned to positions A1- Mexico, B1 - Canada and D1 - USA.

Teams from the same confederation, apart from Uefa, cannot be drawn in the same group.

No more than two teams from Uefa will be in the same group.

Participants will be drawn into a group of four teams. There will be 12 groups in total.

As of 12 November 2025, here are the teams who have qualified for the 2026 World Cup:

Hosts: Canada, Mexico, United States

Africa: Algeria, Cape Verde, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia

Asia: Australia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Uzbekistan

Europe: England

Oceania: New Zealand

South America: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay

It has not been announced who will do the draw in Washington DC, but US President Donald Trump will join Fifa president Gianni Infantino at the event.

Gennaro Gattuso confirms that Gianluca Scamacca and Giacomo Raspadori will start for Italy against Moldova tomorrow, but feels World Cup qualifying in Europe ‘needs to change.'

The penultimate match in Group I kicks off at the Stadionul Zimbru in Chisinau on Thursday at 19.45 GMT.

Even with a victory here and in the final game with Norway at San Siro, it is still practically certain the Azzurri will finish runners-up due to overall goal difference.

“There is absolutely nothing easy about any games, don't forget the game in Reggio Emilia four months ago,” warned Italy coach Gattuso on Sky Sport Italia.

When these sides met in June, Raspadori and Andrea Cambiaso got the goals in a 2-0 victory, which was Luciano Spalletti's last on the bench.

“Many people have in their minds the fact that Norway beat Moldova 11-1, but these are not players who just ran away from home and found themselves on a pitch by accident. They have their own difficulties to deal with, but tomorrow will not be a walk in the park.”

With the showdown against Norway coming up and focus already shifting to the play-offs, the CT warns he is going to shake things up.

“There will be more than one change tomorrow, I want to see the improvement that I've been talking about for a while. There is nothing easy.”

Moise Kean and Nicolò Cambiaghi are among the players who pulled out due to injury, but Gattuso is not hiding his decisions.

“Scamacca and Raspadori will start in Moldova. Scamacca is lacking regular playing time and match fitness, so he mustn't try to over-do it. We know what he can give and his characteristics, he just needs to relax and play his game.”

Italy know that because of that opening 3-0 defeat in Oslo and Norway's incredible goal difference, they didn't stand a chance of recovering to top the group and secure automatic World Cup qualification.

Could a win against Norway increase confidence or boost their regrets?

“There are no regrets. Winning helps us to win, so that is up to us now,” replied Gattuso.

“We do have a few issues over the criteria, because if we look at South America where six out of 10 teams go directly to the World Cup and the seventh head into a play-off with a team from Oceania, that does give you regrets. That is the disappointment, the system needs to change in Europe.”

The Nazionale are therefore already looking ahead to the play-offs in March 2026, where they already stumbled in 2018 and 2022.

“I am honest, my mind is on tomorrow's game and not beyond that. I want to see improvement, how the players train and work together.

“In my view, just having this get-together was not an easy task. We've already qualified for the play-offs, there are little aches and pains. I have to thank the likes of Barella, Calafiori and Bastoni for being here, as it was by no means to be taken for granted.

“I congratulate the lads for their professionalism and hunger, which they show every day,” concluded Gattuso.

Canadian soccer in the winter? It's gritty.

With frigid winds and snow at Toronto FC's training ground on Monday, the Canadian men's national team fine-tuned for their final two matches of 2025, starting with Ecuador on Thursday night at BMO Field (7:30 pm ET).

The match is expected to feature the largest home crowd since the 2022 World Cup qualifying cycle, with 35,000 fans set to fill the stadium that will host Canada's 2026 FIFA World Cup opener next June.

“It's going to be amazing,"" LAFC midfielder Mathieu Choinière smirked in regards to next summer's tournament.

“We have a few months left, and we're building something. We're expecting a loud crowd here, and that's what we're gonna need for the World Cup as we try to bring everybody, the community, behind us, because they've been great so far.”

Even with the dropping temperatures, the goal remains clear: close out 2025 with two wins over South American opposition. Especially after October's 1-0 loss to Australia and scoreless draw vs. Colombia.

“I want everybody to start to feel that this team is good, that this team is exciting, that there's major potential in what can be achieved,"" said head coach Jesse Marsch.

“We want people to know that next summer, this is going to be a fun team to watch, and it's going to be a real event.”

Les Rouges expect to continue building connections, especially in midfield, where Choinière, Stephen Eustáquio, Ismaël Koné, Nathan Saliba, and Jonathan Osorio are vying to be the beating hearts of the 4-4-2.

“Soccer is all about chemistry and understanding each other. If you find that partnership in midfield, everything is just easy, and you know what the other guy next to you likes to do,” Choinière told MLSsoccer.com.

“It's just easier. Our system is clear, and it's been amazing. Whoever is next to me, I know I'm capable of adapting.”

With fleeting opportunities before the World Cup, opportunities to tinker are shrinking. Yet the November window matches on Thursday and Tuesday could potentially lead to more consistency.

The overarching message, though, is a continued build. While key injuries have hampered the squad, they have added two new dual nationals: Middlesbrough center back Alfie Jones and Huddersfield Town goalkeeper Owen Goodman.

“We don't have a lot of time to prepare, so we need to try to make sure that everybody's up to speed with exactly what we want to be like for Thursday, and then we can look at Venezuela,” Marsch said.

“Alfie Jones has fit in really well. He understands many of the football concepts we have, and he's a high-level player. Owen Goodman also has big potential to be a strong, athletic goalkeeper.”

The November window also falls at a tenuous time for some, especially the four players currently in the Audi 2025 MLS Cup Playoffs.

When the team came together earlier in the week, both Vancouver Whitecaps FC's Ali Ahmed and Jayden Nelson approached Choinière, saying “We got you, we got you,” according to the LAFC midfielder, ahead of the Western Conference Semifinal on Nov. 22 (9:30 pm ET | MLS Season Pass, Apple TV).

“Keep talking, we'll see when it comes,” Choinière responded.

“I haven't been speaking to [Choinière] much,” Nelson said. “It's football, but this is our focus now, and when we do go back to our clubs, we have to put that switch to a playoff mentality.”

Can't wait for this showdown. 🍿Everything you need to know about @WhitecapsFC vs. @LAFC in the Western Conference Semifinal of the Audi MLS Cup Playoffs:

For Choinière, in particular, the window marks a national team bookend to a transformative season. After struggling in Switzerland with Grasshopper Zurich, he's hit his stride alongside Son Heung-Min at LAFC, bringing confidence into national team camp and the rest of the playoffs.

“I learned a lot about myself in 2025, about how I want to play the game, what style and who I am as a player,” he said. “I think I'm more mature at the moment and in my style of play and what I need to do to help the team, so I found joy again in playing soccer with LAFC and now Canada.”

On Thursday against Ecuador, he and Canada expect a “similar challenge to Colombia,” but know the primary focus is on building their identity.

Progress over perfection.Le progrès avant la perfection.#CANMNT pic.twitter.com/nsIH6QAI1d

After wrapping up the November window, only March and June 2026 international windows remain, making every step critical – especially when it comes in front of a raucous home crowd.

“I think we were pretty effective against Colombia, and we were a little bit lucky not to give up a goal, but we were a little bit lucky not to get a goal, "" added Marsch. “Ecuador will be a good match.

""We know they're very athletic, very individually talented, and that as a team, they don't give much away. So we'll be ready for it at home.”

You have come to the ESPN Africa edition, for other ESPN editions, click above.

Gab & Juls react to Victor Osimhen's hat trick in Galatasaray's 3-0 victory over Ajax in the Champions League. (0:39)

Back in 1996, as the Super Eagles prepared to defend their Africa Cup of Nations title in South Africa, a famous saying went around the continent that 'the only country that can stop Nigeria, is Nigeria'.

At the time, the reference was to how unstoppable the Super Eagles team were on the field, stacked as they were with the talents that had just won the Africa Cup of Nations and wowed at the World Cup.

These days, however, that statement has warped into something different. It has come to refer, fittingly, to the self-sabotage that the country regularly engages in at the most inopportune of times.

Just two days before their important 2026 FIFA World Cup African playoff semi-final game against Gabon, the full Nigeria squad, including officials, decided to boycott training in Morocco because of unresolved issues with outstanding bonuses and payments.

Sources told ESPN that the team have outstanding bonus payments going back to 2019, including last year's AFCON bonuses and the qualifiers for the next tournament and the ongoing World Cup qualifiers.

Team captain William Troost-Ekong said on Twitter that the team would only return to training after a resolution is reached: ""Once resolution is found we will be the first to confirm. All we want and continue to do is focus on the big games ahead.""

NFF President Ibrahim Musa Gusau is currently in Morocco and as of Wednesday afternoon, the situation appeared to be resolved. Troost-Ekong tweeted that the players would resume training, and that their focus was on the match ahead.

Still, with a potentially decisive game one day away, the timing could not have been worse. Players began reporting to the team's lodgings on Sunday night, and by the Monday when the team held their first training session, there were only 16 of the 24 invited players.

Tuesday would have been Coach Eric Sekou Chelle's first opportunity to practice with a full squad. The boycott meant the best he will have would be just one full session before lining out his team on Thursday.

This should be music to the ears of Gabon, whose coach, Thierry Mouyouma, has promised to take the game to the Super Eagles.

""We have to force them to chase the ball and play behind their own lines,"" Mouyouma told the Gabonese Press Agency (AGP).

""Our objective is to make them work harder, create spaces, and exploit those openings when they appear.""

As damaging as this may look for the Super Eagles however, they have a history of delivering under circumstances such as this.

They won Olympic gold in 1996 while having bonus issues, and at the 2014 World Cup negotiated a similar situation ahead of their win against Bosnia & Herzegovina. Even during qualifying campaigns the Super Eagles have risen above bonus rows and training boycotts to squeak out results on the pitch.

Pressure, it seems, makes diamonds out of Nigeria's Super Eagles. The question however, is whether these Super Eagles share the same battling DNA as their predecessors. On the basis of their results during this series, that is debatable. Still, Gabon would be wise to not underestimate the desire of these Eagles to win.

A post shared by Nigeria Super Eagles (@ng_supereagles)

Chelle, unbeaten in four competitive matches with Nigeria in the qualifying campaign (three wins and a draw), will be hoping that despite everything, that record holds up on Thursday.

He will be counting on the rampant Victor Osimhen, whose 29 goals in 44 matches for the Nigeria senior team have put him firmly on the way to legend territory.

Nigeria lead the head to head between both teams, with five wins from their previous nine encounters, with three draws. Gabon's lone win, a 2-1 victory in 1989, ultimately cost Nigeria a ticket to Italia '90 as the Eagles failed to secure the draw needed against Cameroon's Indomitable Lions in Yaounde on the final day of the series.

It is just the sort of history this present squad will be hoping to repeat.

Portugal has the opportunity to secure qualification for the FIFA 2026 World Cup when they travel to Dublin to play Ireland.

Who: Ireland vs Portugal
What: UEFA World Cup qualifier, Group F
Where: Aviva Stadium in Dublin, Ireland
When: Thursday at 7:45pm (19:45 GMT)

Click here to follow our live coverage.

Unbeaten Portugal (3-1-0) will seal direct qualification to the FIFA World Cup 2026 if they beat Ireland in their penultimate Group F fixture at the Aviva Stadium.

Armed with a five-point lead, Roberto Martinez's team are in the box seat to seal a seventh consecutive appearance at football's global showpiece.

Ireland (1-1-2), for their part, still have a mathematical chance to keep their World Cup aspirations alive by causing a huge upset on Thursday night against an opponent that is fifth in the FIFA world rankings.

They are currently third in the group – but only a point behind second-placed Hungary with two matches still to play. Ireland last qualified for the World Cup in 2006.

Here is all to know about their Group F return clash:

Scenario 1: 

Group leaders Portugal require a win against Ireland to ensure direct World Cup qualification into next year's tournament, which is being held in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

In this scenario, Portugal would have 13 points – an insurmountable lead over the other three teams in the group with just one match remaining.

Scenario 2:

If Portugal were to draw its final two fixtures against Ireland and Armenia, they would also finish top of the Group F standings with 12 points from six matches.

Scenario 3:

If Portugal lose its final two matches against Ireland and Armenia, and Hungary – which currently has five points – wins its final two fixtures against Armenia and Ireland, then Hungary would move top of Group F with 11 points vs Portugal's 10 points.

If Ireland win their final two games, and Portugal lose their final two games, then the teams would be level on 10 points at the top of the standings with the group winner being decided by goal difference.

All 12 group winners in Europe qualify directly for the World Cup while the runners-up go on to the playoffs for the remaining finals places taking place in March.

Portugal were on the brink of punching their ticket to the World Cup as they led Hungary 2-1 in stoppage time in Lisbon, knowing a win would confirm first place in Group F.

However, Hungary snatched a late draw when Liverpool's Dominik Szoboszlai finished from close range in injury time.

The teams last played on October 11 in Lisbon.

Portugal's Ruben Neves scored a stoppage-time goal to snatch a dramatic 1-0 home win in Group F after his teammate Ronaldo had a penalty saved earlier in the match as Ireland threatened to hold the unbeaten hosts to a draw.

Yes. With Portugal on the verge of qualifying for the World Cup, Ronaldo confirmed the tournament in North America will be his swansong on football's biggest stage.

“Definitely, yes, because I will be 41 years old [at the World Cup],” said Ronaldo, who is also the top scorer in history with 143 international goals.

“I gave everything for football. I've been in the game for the last 25 years. I did everything. I have many records in the different scenarios in the clubs and also in the national teams.

“I'm really proud. So let's enjoy the moment, live the moment.”

This is only the 18th meeting between the European sides with Portugal winning 10 and Ireland winning four.

Ireland's last win came in a friendly in 2005, courtesy of Andy O'Brien's solitary strike in Dublin. There have been four subsequent matches, of which Portugal have won three.

Ireland's last competitive win against Portugal came in a European Championships qualifier in 1995.

The fixture dates back to 1946 and began with a 3-1 home win for Portugal in a friendly.

D-D-L-L-W (most recent result last)

Chelsea winger Pedro Neto has withdrawn from Martinez's squad after he suffered a groin injury in his side's 3-0 Premier League victory over Wolves on Saturday. Rafael Leao is the most likely replacement for Neto.

Sporting Lisbon midfielder Pedro Goncalves is also out for a month after an undisclosed injury playing against Santa Clara on the weekend.

“[I'm] out of these next two games and not being able to be present in the World Cup qualifiers. Something I always dreamed of was representing the National Team, and not being able to go hurts. Now it's time to recover properly, even though I'm not doing what I love the most! Thank you to the team for the effort until the end! We still have a lot to achieve,” Goncalves wrote on social media.

Ronaldo, who has yet to score away to Ireland in four career meetings, will lead the line for Portugal.

In a big blow to Ireland's chances, star striker Evan Ferguson is out of the Portugal fixture with an ankle issue and is in doubt for their final World Cup match against Hungary, which may decide who finishes second in Group F.

Manager Heimir Hallgrimsson will also be without three other injured regulars in the squad: Callum O'Dowda (minor knock), Mark Sykes (shin) and Sammie Szmodics (knee).

Ryan Manning and Jayson Molumby are serving one match suspensions.

Ireland: Kelleher (goalkeeper); O'Brien, O'Shea, Collins; Coleman, Cullen, Taylor, Johnston; Ebosele, Azaz; Parrott

Portugal: Costa (goalkeeper); Cancelo, Dias, Inacio, Mendes; Fernandes, Vitinha, Neves, Bernardo, Ronaldo, Leao

Hallgrimsson:

“If Armenia wins or there is a draw, a win in Hungary is enough for us, so that is two of four scenarios for us,” the Ireland manager said.

“If Hungary win, we need at least a draw, but if they win by two or three goals, we will need a draw [against Portugal] and win by maybe three goals away in Hungary.

“We will know what we need in this game against Portugal before we kick off, which is a benefit to us, but it doesn't change how we start and play the game, but may need to take calculated risks as the game progresses.”

Martinez:

“November is always a difficult stage. Even so, our focus is on qualifying for the World Cup. … We have to improve, especially in the final 20 minutes of games,” Portugal's manager said.

England international Reece James called out the weather and pitch conditions in the United States ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

James and Chelsea won the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the U.S. this past summer. The club captain made five appearances in the expanded competition, getting some first-hand experience of what the summer conditions would be like come 2026. 

Describing the “difficult” conditions, the 25-year-old insisted England are keeping the weather in mind when preparing for the tournament.

“It's been a key message that the conditions will be tough in the middle of the summer in America. Everyone is aware of that. We're trying to prepare as best we can for that,” James told assembled media at England's press conference on Wednesday.

“It's super difficult conditions to play in that heat. Especially for us playing in England, there's not anything like that before. Once you are out there you adapt the longer you are there, when you are settled in one place and try to limit the things you can.”

James revealed England plan on arriving to the U.S. early to get themselves acclimated to the environment.

Even more concerning was James restarting the pitch conditions conversation with less than seven months to go until the World Cup.

“The pitches when we were there weren't the greatest either and made it a little bit harder. But hopefully by the time the World Cup comes around it's better,” James admitted, though he did not specify which stadiums were of concern.

Chelsea played at four different stadiums in the Club World Cup, three of which will be in use at the 2026 international tournament.

The right back is not the first player in recent history to question the playing surfaces in the U.S., especially among Club World Cup competitors. Former Palmeiras player, Estêvão, also called out the pitch conditions at MetLife Stadium in their group stage match against Porto. The stadium is set to host the World Cup final. 

MetLife historically is a controversial venue for its synthetic turf. The eye-raising amount of season-ending injuries suffered in the NFL at the stadium raised concern initially, but natural grass was installed for the Club World Cup as required by FIFA. Still, the changes seem to be substandard in players' minds.

Argentina's Emiliano Martínez and Lionel Scaloni also denounced pitch conditions during the 2024 Copa América when they played at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

Whisper it quietly, but Manchester United are close to being a proper team once again. They have a competent goalkeeper at last in Senne Lammens, as well as top-level forwards who cannot only create quality chances but also finish them off in Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. They have also developed some resilience, as evidenced by their crucial late goals at Nottingham Forest, Tottenham and Liverpool of late.


But they are still missing a crucial element of any team with aspirations to return to the Champions League and compete for the Premier League title: a consistent and top-class midfield. Ruben Amorim's side have been getting by with Bruno Fernandes sitting deeper alongside Casemiro, who is enjoying an Indian summer. Both players have been performing admirably in their respective circumstances, but they both have asterixis by their names.

Fernandes is 31 and the spectre of him winding down his career in Saudi Arabia has not fully gone away despite him resisting the advances of Al-Hilal last summer. Casemiro, meanwhile, might be rolling back the years right now, but he turns 34 in February and his contract is up in June, albeit with the option to trigger a one-year extension. 

Neither player screams long-term planning, and it is no secret that United need and want to sign a top-class midfielder who can lead the team for many years. It is becoming increasingly clear, too, that the man they should be looking at to return them to the highest level is Elliot Anderson, who just happens to also be the future of the England team.

Anderson was one of the main driving forces behind Nottingham Forest's brilliant 2024-25 campaign as they finished seventh in the Premier League in their third season back in the top-flight, narrowly missing out on the Champions League while reaching the FA Cup semi-finals. But while the Tricky Trees' results have nosedived amid the upheaval of having three separate coaches already this term, Anderson has continued to stand tall. Taller than every other midfielder in the Premier League, in fact.

Name every attribute you want a midfielder to have, and there is a good chance Anderson will lead the way in it. According to FBREF, he sits No.1 among Premier League midfielders in passes attempted, passes completed, progressive passes, passes into the final third, short passes attempted and completed. 

He also has the highest passing distance among midfielders (and the fourth-highest in the league) and highest progressive passing distance of any midfielder. In that last category, he is ranked 20th in the league in a field dominated by goalkeepers. The closest midfielder to him is Fernandes in 30th, then Granit Xhaka at 45th while his England team-mate Declan Rice is 50th. Anderson has an accumulated progressive passing distance of 3844 metres, 447 more than Fernandes, 986 more than Xhaka and 1049 more than Rice. 

In addition, he has more touches on the ball than any other midfielder, and the most ball recoveries.

""Elliot Anderson can do it all,"" said former United and England winger Ashley Young. ""He can defend, he can get on the front foot, he can play line-breaking passes. He can create, he can do the other side of it as well and win the tackles and release the players further forward.""

Anderson displayed that passing vision with an assist for Chris Wood on the opening day of this season, threading the ball into the forward's path from behind the halfway line. In England's 5-0 win away to Serbia in September, meanwhile, he provided a pre-assist with his forward pass to Morgan Rogers, whose flashy flick of the boot released goal-scorer Noni Madueke. No Serbia player managed to dribble past him that night, while in the 5-0 drubbing of Latvia last month which sealed England's spot at the World Cup, Anderson completed 121 passes, the most by any player in an England away game since 2008.

What has really stood out for England has been Anderson's ability to take the ball from defence and glide past opponents to distribute it further downfield. ""His physicality for a player of his size, the way he can keep people away from the ball and get about the pitch is a big strength,"" said his England team-mate Dan Burn, who also played alongside him at Newcastle. ""He's always wanting the ball wherever he is. He's so calm when he gets it, he's got that eye for the passes that we probably need.""

Speaking after his excellent debut for England against Andorra amid an otherwise dreary team performance in June, Thomas Tuchel said of Anderson. ""He has the physicality, he's a very mobile No.6. He has the body, he loves to defend, he loves to put his body inside to win duels. He loves passing, he loves to break the lines. And he's just very mobile in his game.""

Rice, who has lacked a consistent partner for England since Kalvin Phillips' peak at Euro 2020, is really enjoying playing alongside Anderson: ""He has taken it all in his stride and is playing like he plays for his club. When you have a lad who is that confident and comes in and feels he does not have to do anything different, it's like autopilot the way he plays. We are building up a nice little partnership.""

Anderson's versatility explains why he has managed to perform well for each of his three Forest coaches, going from the counter-attacking football of Nuno Espirito Santo to the positional play of Ange Postecoglou and then back to the more reactive play of Sean Dyche. Nuno deployed him all over the midfield, from an anchoring No.6 to a driving No.8 to a creative No.10 when Morgan Gibbs-White was unavailable. 

Eddie Howe also played Anderson in more attacking roles when in charge of him at Newcastle before he was sold to Forest for £35 million ($46m) in a move that was widely considered to have been to ease the Magpies' PSR concerns.

Forest might be about to make a massive return on that investment as the latest reports claim they will demand between £100m and £120m ($131.5m-$158m) for Anderson. It is a similar price tag that United were quoted by Brighton for Carlos Baleba over the summer, which ultimately led to them turning away from the Cameroon international. 

Anderson's stock has risen way above Baleba's in the last three months, and a £100m-plus fee is not actually that outlandish when compared to the two leading midfielders in the league over the last couple of years, Rice and Moises Caicedo. Arsenal paid a club-record £105m to sign Rice from West Ham in 2023. He was 24 at the time and was also an England regular at that stage, albeit with considerably more experience than Anderson given he had both a European Championship and a World Cup under his belt. Caicedo, meanwhile, moved from Brighton to Chelsea at the age of 21 that same summer for £115m.

Rice has been the main driving force behind Arsenal's consistent results over the last three seasons while Caicedo was instrumental to Chelsea finishing fourth in the league last season and to them winning the Club World Cup. And if Anderson, who only turned 23 at the start of November, continues on the same path he is at the moment, there is no reason why he could not do the same for United.

His ability to play in different midfield roles will also be useful for the club's succession planning. He could fill in for Casemiro next season as Amorim's primary holding midfielder if the Brazilian leaves this summer before taking the baton from Fernandes in 2027, when the captain's current contract will be up.

There seems to be unanimous agreement that Anderson is a player on the rise and who has the mentality to cope with a potential move to United.

""He has all the hallmarks of players who get absolutely everything they can out of their careers,"" said Postecoglou during his brief stint in charge at the City Ground. ""He has such a strong outlook and understanding of what is important in his life. He wants to be the best he can be. He is very professional. He looks after himself off the field. He makes sure everything he does is right. That shows me that there is even more improvement in him, when you see that kind of mentality.""

Dyche made a point of Anderson's loud mouth, something he has in common with Fernandes, but he also emphasised his other qualities: ""He deals with the ball well and has a really good attitude. He's got that nice nature about him. He moans in a good way. He's a really good player. He is learning as he goes about the Premier League, positionally and the nuts and bolts of it, but he is a really good player.""

Anderson's positive personality traits are extra important as United have made a point of prioritising players with good attitudes after having bad experiences with the likes of Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho in recent years. It was also reported this week that Amorim had given Manuel Ugarte a dressing down in front of his team-mates for resting on his laurels since joining the club. As Leny Yoro put it: ""We don't want any bad things in the team. We cannot build something with bad energy or bad atmosphere or bad characters.""

Amorim name-checked Anderson ahead of United's recent game at Forest, describing him as a ""very, very good player"" and it set tongues wagging online as last season he had singled out Cunha before playing Wolves, and a couple of months later United signed the Brazilian.

There is an obvious precedent when it comes to United targeting a young tenacious holding midfielder from Forest given that is where they signed Roy Keane from. United broke the British transfer record to sign Keane in 1993 for £3.75m, and it might take another record fee to get Anderson to Old Trafford. But if it means getting an England star who can have the same impact as Rice or Caicedo, it is a price well worth paying.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden & the eight England players with the most at stake in Three Lions' final World Cup qualifiers","https://www.goal.com/en-sg/lists/jude-bellingham-phil-foden-england-players-most-at-stake-three-lions-final-world-cup-qualifiers/blt0834084e555053f8","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 08:00:00 GMT","

Having already booked their tickets to the United States, Canada and Mexico next summer, England will wrap up a very successful World Cup qualifying campaign with dead-rubber fixtures against Serbia and Albania in the coming days - but for certain members of Thomas Tuchel's squad the games will be far from meaningless, with everything on the line as the clock ticks down.

The Three Lions have just four more matches to play before Tuchel announces his provisional travelling party in May, so there is incredibly limited time to make an impression on the head coach up close and personal. After the final qualifiers, England will play two friendlies in March. Then, it's decision time for their German tactician.

His latest squad was once again difficult to predict; there is the potential for more senior debuts and recalls for both Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden, while other big names like Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jack Grealish continue to be overlooked as their hopes of making the final cut fade.

Even for certain players who have been included in the November camp, the pressure is on, with Tuchel admitting he has ""a settled mind"" when it comes to those who will be on the plane come June: ""I will also be open because I know anything can happen. I need to make sure the door is always open and they are on their toes and they have a chance to be with us.""

With that in mind, here are the eight England players most under pressure to deliver in the Three Lions' final World Cup qualifiers...

Bellingham was made to sweat, but he is back for the November camp after returning to form and fitness at Real Madrid. In truth, omitting him would have been an astounding decision after he was overlooked in October, not long after his return from shoulder surgery, with Tuchel this time unable to point to the need for him to get back into his groove at club level and potentially generating some serious scrutiny over what has been going on behind the scenes.

As it is, the midfield dynamo has been recalled, but he will certainly feel he has a point to prove amid question marks over whether his fiery on-pitch demeanour is actually to the detriment of the team, and with Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers making a play for his starting place in recent matches. How that desire to stake his claim manifests itself will be highly intriguing, as Bellingham finds himself joining up with an otherwise-settled squad for the first time since Tuchel was forced to apologise to him for revealing that his own mother sometimes finds the midfielder's antics ""repulsive"" in the summer.

The manager has spoken about harnessing the ""edge"" the 22-year-old brings: ""There is no problem with him, there is no problem with the character. Jude just has the edge, it is a very good thing because you need a certain edge to reach the heights that he reached and I think we all need to help him and encourage him and create an environment which he can live this edge towards the opponents and towards the goals we are building as a team.""

A late call-up for England's final World Cup qualifiers after Marc Guehi was left unable to walk following a heavy blow in Crystal Palace's Conference League clash against AZ Alkmaar, Chalobah will be acutely aware that he already faces an uphill battle to guarantee a place in England's travelling party to North America, let alone a starting place.

Tuchel has handed him his senior debut at both club and international level, but the 26-year-old hadn't been included in a Three Lions squad since the June camp, when Chalobah collected his one and only cap to date in a dire 3-1 friendly defeat to Senegal at Nottingham Forest's City Ground - a game in which he didn't cover himself in glory as he started and played the full 90 minutes.

Chalobah, though, continues to be a regular starter for Chelsea this season under Enzo Maresca, and while his performances have been inconsistent, he will want to seize this second chance that has been provided to him by Guehi's injury. With the Palace man arguably the only nailed-on starter at the World Cup, there is plenty of scope for other centre-backs to assert themselves. This could well be Chalobah's last chance to do so.

Judging by Tuchel's recent selection calls, Foden is well and truly in the last chance saloon as the World Cup looms large on the horizon. This is the Manchester City man's first call-up since the head coach began work in earnest back in March, as he was overlooked in June and October, either side of an injury that kept him out in September.

While he would be the first to admit that he still isn't back to his best, Foden seems to have overcome the physical and mental issues that took such a toll on him last season, revealing that he is 'playing with a smile on his face' again and producing a particularly impressive individual performance against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League recently. However, an inability to deliver for England has long been his kryptonite, and the coach's decision to omit him previously suggests the 25-year-old is under serious pressure to prove himself in the colours of his national team.

Interestingly, Tuchel has now insisted that he won't use Foden as a winger like his predecessor Gareth Southgate did, meaning he faces some serious competition from the likes of Bellingham, Rogers, Eberechi Eze, Cole Palmer and Morgan Gibbs-White for the attacking midfield berth.

""It does not make sense to tell, for example, 'Phil...there's no space in your best position, can you play left wing for us? Can you play right wing for us?' I think that does not work,"" the manager said. ""For this camp, Phil will be in the number 9-10ish position, in the middle of the pitch. Because I have this fantasy about him since a long time. I think it suits him the most.""

Nico O'Reilly certainly won't be fazed by the challenge of nailing down a place in Tuchel's squad, having made smooth progress to become a first-team regular at Man City aged just 20, under the revered Pep Guardiola, no less. However, that doesn't mean there isn't plenty at stake as he effectively looks to keep Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly out of the squad.

The left-back, who is nominally a midfielder, was included in the squad for the games against Wales and Latvia in October but didn't make it off the bench. This time, though, O'Reilly will expect to get an opportunity with nothing riding on the final qualifiers against Serbia and Albania, especially with Lewis-Skelly being dropped as the teenager pays the price for a lack of minutes at club level.

Indeed, the battle to be one of the left-backs included in the World Cup squad will seemingly come down to club game time, with Tottenham's Djed Spence looking likely to be involved. O'Reilly is currently a regular starter for City and that seems unlikely to change as he keeps fit-again Rayan Ait-Nouri out of the team, while his chances are boosted because the Algerian will soon jet off for the Africa Cup of Nations.

As we've touched upon, at least one centre-back slot is fair game as things stand as a number of players vie for the position alongside Guehi. However, like Chalobah, Quansah is someone who feels as though they are on the periphery as the clock ticks down towards Tuchel's final squad selection.

A graduate of the Under-21 squad that triumphed at the European Championship (again) in the summer, the ex-Liverpool man is actually yet to make his senior bow despite being involved in the March, September and October camps. That will be a concern, as Guehi, John Stones, Dan Burn and Ezri Konsa have all earned minutes in that time.

Quansah is getting plenty of game time at Bayer Leverkusen, where he has helped the Bundesliga giants make a solid start to the season, but it's clear he needs to do more to command a chance from Tuchel. He will hope November's dead-rubber clashes give him the platform to show what he can do.

A surprise call-up, Alex Scott will be well aware that he's up against it with scant opportunities to make an impression before Tuchel names his squad for the tournament in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. That said, the pressure is arguably off him and there could be an opportunity to stake a claim in midfield.

Elliot Anderson's sudden rise to prominence under Tuchel should certainly serve as motivation for the Bournemouth man, who, like his Nottingham Forest counterpart, will be competing for either the No.6 or No.8 position alongside Declan Rice, with Adam Wharton probably the biggest threat to his chances. Indeed, there is an opening to at least make it into the travelling party, with the likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Conor Gallagher and Curtis Jones still being overlooked.

Another graduate of the U21 squad, Scott will be buoyed by the head coach's glowing words about him following his call-up. ""He had an excellent Euros,"" Tuchel said. ""He did an excellent job in midfield together with Elliot Anderson, who is now a regular starter for us - he was very impressive. Then he took another step and becomes a very regular starter for Bournemouth and they are in the top third of the league. They are over-performing constantly and he is a starter for them. He puts the intensity in and he gets his minutes. So, we thought it was maybe a perfect time to reward him and get to know him and to see what he can bring to our team.""

Some believed James Trafford would be the man to dethrone long-time England No.1 Jordan Pickford when he left Burnley this summer, but a return to Man City has proven to be ill-advised for the 23-year-old. Following a difficult start to the season as first-choice goalkeeper, he was swiftly replaced by fellow new arrival Gianluigi Donnarumma - considered by many to be the best on the planet - and he doesn't look likely to regain the gloves anytime soon.

Indeed, Tuchel had initially omitted Trafford from his squad for the clashes against Serbia and Albania for the first time since taking the reins, but a concussion suffered by the recalled Nick Pope - whom Newcastle had wanted him to replace in the summer transfer window - has given the shot-stopper a reprieve, for the time being at least.

It's worth bearing in mind that, despite being involved in the German tactician's camps, the City academy graduate is still yet to make his senior Three Lions bow, with the manager making it abundantly clear that his players need to be regulars at club level to stand any chance of breaking into his plans. Trafford, then, may well have to consider his future in January.

After a public outcry that was particularly loud in a certain corner of south London, Wharton is finally back in the England fold for the first time since being included in the squad for Euro 2024, where he didn't get onto the pitch. In fact, the midfielder's one and only cap remains a 28-minute cameo against Bosnia and Herzegovina in a warm-up game for that tournament, 17 months ago. He had been forced to withdraw from the group for the September camp through injury.

Finally, though, the 21-year-old is back in the picture, although he will know he has his work cut out. Wharton has shone for Crystal Palace, starting every game he has been available for this season in the Premier League, but it seems Tuchel may not see him as the right tactical fit for his system after snubbing him in October, much to many fans' surprise. He now finds himself competing with the likes of Anderson and Scott.

""Hopefully he will not pick up any injury or illness,"" the England boss said. ""They still have two matches, so hopefully he stays fit. The talent is obvious and he will be alongside Elliot Anderson and Jordan Henderson in defensive midfield and hopefully try to impress us. I think it's the right thing to do, it's the right call-up to reward him. Hopefully three times is the lucky number for him.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Barcelona president Joan Laporta has confirmed that institutional relations between them and their Clasico rivals Real Madrid ""aren't good because they appeared in the Negreira case, presenting irrelevant and inconclusive evidence."" The Catalans have been embroiled in legal proceedings over allegations that they paid Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira, the former vice-president of the Spanish Referees' Committee (CTA), to influence matches.

The 'Negreira' case has become perhaps the most high-profile legal case in football in recent history, with Barcelona accused of paying €8 million to Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira, the former vice-president of the CTA (Technical Comitttee of Referees in Spain), between 2001 and 2018 for unethical purposes. 

In October, a Barcelona court issued a formal order requiring the Catalan club to hand over all contracts and supporting documents related to the ongoing investigation. According to reports from El Mundo, investigators have been unable to locate the original agreements or any written records in Barcelona's archives to substantiate the payments, which were allegedly made for “refereeing advisory” services. The absence of documentation has deepened suspicions about the club's dealings with Negreira.

The court's directive goes beyond the collection of administrative records, as Barcelona have also been summoned to testify as a legal entity. Former coaches Luis Enrique and Ernesto Valverde, along with current club president Laporta, are scheduled to appear as witnesses on November 25.

Speaking on Catalunya Radio, Laporta said: “The meeting was proper, respectful, and harmonious. We've never been married, so a divorce isn't possible. Relations aren't good because they appeared in the Negreira case, presenting irrelevant and inconclusive evidence. Having the case open must be of some interest to them. We don't like it, and it's a tense situation. We're eternal rivals, and we handle it with respect. I didn't want to get into the issue of the match in Miami against Villarreal. We saw opposition from the AFE (Spanish Footballers' Association) and other clubs from the very beginning. I don't believe the competition will be compromised.”

Los Blancos approached the matter with urgency, calling a board meeting in March 2023 as accusations against Barcelona intensified. According to a report from Marcain September, Real Madrid are determined to pursue the Negreira case to its fullest extent, seeking consequences wherever possible. The club reportedly believes that a long-standing culture of bias still exists against them and considers sanctions against Barcelona essential for the integrity of both Real Madrid and Spanish football.

What's more, Real Madrid TV, the club's official media channel, has intensified its coverage of the case, releasing a series of reports highlighting what the club views as years of unfair treatment. The broadcasts have examined data such as the distribution of yellow and red cards involving both Barcelona and Real Madrid matches – a continuation of an editorial stance the channel has maintained for some time.

Recently, Madrid lodged an official complaint to FIFA which centred on alleged refereeing inconsistencies, highlighting incidents such as Arda Guler's disallowed goal, Kylian Mbappe's marginal offside calls, and Dean Huijsen's red card against Real Sociedad. Club president Florentino Perez has called for international oversight, arguing that domestic officiating lacks credibility.

When asked about the issue, head coach Xabi Alonso acknowledged that defending the club's interests is legitimate but warned against allowing refereeing controversies to dominate the conversation. ""It's legitimate to defend our interests. As long as the club does it, it's fine. I don't want the refereeing issue to be a one-track mind. Let's think about tomorrow. The Anoeta incident has been discussed enough,"" he said.

The complaint also references the Negreira case, asserting that the scandal continues to undermine confidence in Spanish refereeing, as several current officials began their careers under his tenure.

After appearing at one of the hearings in September, former Barcelona president Sandro Rosell blasted Madrid for escalating matters to FIFA while also defending the Catalans. ""A gentleman's club should have accepted this and not dragged it out for life as they are trying to do to cover up other things,"" he said. ""Like now, for example, after four league games, they have already gone to complain to FIFA about the refereeing. Where is Mr. Negreira now?

""Here they can say that we're closing the case because the evidence supports the accused... and that's it. Let's all sit down and watch the games again. I'd love to. Maybe some people here wouldn't like to watch it again. I'm sorry. But sometimes you don't win. Sometimes you lose, and you have to accept that.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Kylian Mbappe cheekily tells Real Madrid target Dayot Upamecano there are 'better teams' than Bayern Munich as La Liga side eye free transfer for French defender","https://www.goal.com/en-gb/lists/kylian-mbappe-real-madrid-target-dayot-upamecano-better-teams-than-bayern-munich-la-liga-free-transfer-french-defender/blt06c1e3038075155e","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 15:03:46 GMT","

Kylian Mbappe has cheekily hinted that his France teammate Dayot Upamecano could find “better teams” than Bayern Munich in a playful invitation to join him at Real Madrid. The defender is out of contract in 2026, and talks with Bayern remain unresolved. With Los Blancos searching for a long-term defensive anchor, Mbappe's comments have reignited talk of a blockbuster French reunion in Madrid.

Madrid's pursuit of a new central defender has taken a familiar turn, straight into the heart of France's national team setup. Last week reports emerged in Spain that Los Blancos have held preliminary talks with the representatives of Upamecano, who could be available on a free transfer in 2026 if Bayern fail to secure a renewal.

The 27-year-old centre-back has become one of Vincent Kompany's key players at Bayern, forming a formidable partnership in defence and featuring heavily across competitions. However, with Madrid exploring options due to long-term fitness concerns around David Alaba and Eder Militao, Upamecano's name remains high on their shortlist. 

Adding intrigue to the speculation, Mbappe was quizzed about his compatriot's situation ahead of France's World Cup qualifiers and couldn't resist a mischievous comment about Bayern's place in football's pecking order.

Mbappe, speaking at a press conference, was full of admiration for Upamecano's recent form but couldn't help letting a playful smile slip when asked whether his teammate should stay in Munich.

“He's doing very well, he's very confident, full of self-assurance. He's in the debate about who is the best defender in the world,” Mbappe said. “For me, he's one of those dominant defenders. He's capable of keeping up with the forwards, of winning duels. He's a tactical asset.”

With a grin, Mbappe added a line that quickly caught fire: “He's at a big club, Bayern, there's not much better… But there are better ones [smiles]. I'm not going to say anything, I'm not going to get into that debate, out of respect for his club and for him, because I know that if I say something he'll be under more pressure. But when you talk about a player of this calibre, all the clubs will be on the lookout to sign him.”

In response to mounting speculation, the former RB Leipzig has remained composed and avoided fueling transfer talk. Speaking to L'Equipe recently, Upamecano said he's letting his representatives handle discussions while focusing on the season ahead.

""My agent is taking care of it. We will make the right decision. I am receiving good advice,"" he said. ""I am focused on this season and my goals with the club and the national team. I don't have the headspace for it.""

At the same time, he expressed appreciation for the growing interest in his future: “I'm completely relaxed. I'm under contract with Bayern. I have goals. But I'm very grateful when clubs are interested in me.”

Upamecano's agent Moussa Sissoko, who also represents Ousmane Dembele, is known for his strong negotiating stance and close connections within French football circles. His involvement adds another layer to the ongoing situation, especially with the Bavarians pushing for an extension to avoid losing the defender at his peak.

For Madrid, the potential arrival of a French international with Champions League pedigree and a strong relationship with Mbappe fits perfectly within Florentino Perez's recruitment model.

Bayern remain confident of keeping Upamecano, but there's a growing sense within the club that delaying negotiations could prove costly. The Bavarian giants have already seen several key players depart on free transfers in recent seasons - a scenario they are determined to avoid repeating with one of their most reliable defenders.

Club president Herbert Hainer confirmed that discussions with the player's representatives are already underway, expressing optimism about a positive outcome. “We are in the process of speaking with Upamecano. I believe he feels comfortable in Munich. It's obviously an important decision for him as well. In principle, he likes it very much at Bayern. We would like to keep him. I am cautiously optimistic.”

While Madrid continue to monitor developments quietly from afar, Bayern's leadership remain united in their stance that Upamecano is central to their long-term plans. For now, both camps are handling matters with professionalism, Mbappe's teasing remarks aside but with Les Blues stars regularly linking up on and off the pitch, speculation around a future Madrid move is unlikely to fade anytime soon.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Lionel Messi's late-night visit to the newly renovated Camp Nou has reignited talk of a fairy tale return, with Barcelona goalkeeper Joan Garcia among those hoping to see the legend back in Blaugrana colours. The Inter Miami star shared an emotional post after walking on the pitch again, while Garcia and president Joan Laporta both spoke about the World Cup winner's enduring bond with the club.

Messi sent shockwaves through Barcelona this week after making a surprise midnight visit to the newly renovated Camp Nou, stepping onto the pitch he once illuminated for nearly two decades. Currently on a break from MLS duties with Inter Miami, Messi took the opportunity to tour the ongoing stadium renovations and share a heartfelt message with Barcelona fans, his first since leaving the club in 2021.

The Argentine posted an emotional note on Instagram after the visit: “Last night I returned to a place I miss with my soul. A place where I was immensely happy, where you guys made me feel a thousand times the happiest person in the world. I hope one day I can come back, and not just to say goodbye as a player, as I never got to…”

Messi's message immediately sparked speculation about a possible loan return in 2026, although Barcelona officials were quick to dismiss the rumours. Still, for fans and players alike, his visit was a reminder of the unbreakable bond between the club and its greatest icon.

Speaking to RAC1, Barcelona goalkeeper Joan Garcia revealed the dressing room's surprise when Messi's visit came to light and admitted that he, too, dreams of playing alongside the Argentine great.

“No one expected Messi to do that, it's good what he did. We talked about it in the dressing room, but we didn't give it much importance either,” Garcia said. “I hope he can come and play with us, but I don't know how possible or realistic that is.”

The former Espanyol shot-stopper, who joined Barca in the summer, also took the chance to speak about his relationships with the team's goalkeepers.

On Wojciech Szczesny, he said warmly: “He's a star. He's very funny, we laugh a lot with him. Those of us who speak Catalan are teaching him words.”

Garcia defended the Polish goalkeeper amid criticism for recent goals conceded: “That's what Hansi asks of us, knowing that sometimes it won't work out. He told me that's how we play, and that it can happen.”

When asked about Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Garcia was equally composed: “With Ter, everything is fine. The relationship is normal, like with any other teammate. It wasn't uncomfortable for me.”

Barca president Joan Laporta also addressed Messi's visit during an interview with Catalunya Radio, dismissing rumours of a short-term loan return while reaffirming that the club is preparing a fitting tribute for their former captain.

“Out of respect for Messi, our players, and our members, it's not the time to speculate with unrealistic scenarios,” Laporta said.

The president admitted he was unaware of Inter Miami star's visit but expressed delight at the gesture: “I didn't know he was coming, but Camp Nou is his home. When they explained how it happened, I think it was a sweet little spur-of-the-moment decision; he'd just finished dinner and felt like coming with some friends. It's only right that Leo receives the most beautiful tribute in the world.”

Laporta confirmed that the club are working on a dedicated tribute ceremony for Messi once the Camp Nou renovations are complete, with the new stadium expected to seat 105,000 fans.

While the spotlight has been on Messi's emotional return, Garcia himself is close to making his own comeback. The 24-year-old goalkeeper has been sidelined for several months following meniscus surgery, but is now expected to return after the international break. The upcoming La Liga clash against Athletic Club on November 22, after the international break could mark Garcia's long-awaited debut at the renovated stadium - a moment he admits he's been eagerly anticipating.

For now, though, even as Garcia looks forward to stepping back on the pitch, his thoughts reflect those of millions of Barcelona fans worldwide - the dream of seeing Messi back where it all began.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","'I hope he makes the right decision!'","https://www.goal.com/en-gb/lists/jonathan-tah-offers-transfer-advice-nico-schlotterbeck-bayern-munich-target-borussia-dortmund-defender/blta4b7884b21f36e2f","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 15:56:38 GMT","

Nico Schlotterbeck's future at Borussia Dortmund is up in the air. With Bayern Munich and Liverpool both pushing to sign the defender and contract talks at Dortmund stalling, his Germany teammate Jonathan Tah has stepped in, offering advice and support as the 25-year-old weighs a crucial decision about his next move.


According to a report from Bild, the German centre-back has turned down Dortmund's latest contract offer and is growing frustrated with the team's playing style under coach Niko Kovac. His current deal runs until 2027, but reports suggest he is unlikely to sign an extension, increasing speculation about a possible move next summer. The 25-year-old joined Dortmund from Freiburg in 2022 and has since become one of the club's key players, making 134 appearances in all competitions. Despite his importance, uncertainty around his future continues to grow.

Dortmund are reportedly preparing a new contract proposal that would keep him at the club until 2030 and are even ready to triple his salary. However, the German international has shown no intention of committing to an extension for now, preferring to keep his options open amid growing interest from top European clubs, including Liverpool and Bayern Munich.

Speaking during a press conference ahead of Germany's World Cup qualifying match against Luxembourg, Tah had nothing but praise for his national teammate and domestic rival. The Munich defender urged the Dortmund centre-back to think carefully before making his next move.

""This is an exciting situation for Nico,"" said Tah. ""He's an outstanding player who always works on himself, who always wants to improve. It's a crucial point in his career right now, and I simply hope he can make the right decision for himself. Many doors are open to him. I wish him all the best in making his decision.""

The German also made it clear that he is there to support his teammate if needed. ""If he needs advice or wants to talk to me, he's welcome to do so. I'm here,"" he added.

Recently, Schlotterbeck himself spoke highly of Tah, calling him 'a better defender' and explaining why the pair work so well together for the national team.

""Jona is very communicative on the pitch and simply important to me. Defensively, he has been a very strong defender for years now and has done extremely well. For me, the ball-playing aspect is perhaps a bit more interesting than for him. He's perhaps a better defender, though. That's why it's a good fit.""

Dortmund's rival Munich are reportedly keeping a close eye on German's situation as they look to strengthen their backline ahead of next season. With Dayot Upamecano's contract set to expire next year, Bayern could turn to Schlotterbeck as a younger replacement. Meanwhile, the reigning Premier League champions are also in the race. The Reds are preparing for defensive changes, with Virgil van Dijk reaching the twilight of his career and uncertainty surrounding Ibrahima Konate's future, whose contract expires this summer amid interest from Los Blancos. 

With both Bayern and Liverpool circling, Schlotterbeck faces a career-defining choice. Dortmund want to keep him. Last month, Sporting director Lars Ricken publicly addressed the situation, making it clear that while the club respects Schlotterbeck's hesitation, they won't let talks drag on.

“We will not rush into anything. But of course, we don't want to drag it out indefinitely, everyone is aware of that,"" Ricken told Sport Bild.

For now, the German won't feature in the national team's upcoming match after withdrawing from the squad due to injury. The defender's priority would be to recover quickly and help Dortmund get back into the title race. The club currently sits third in the table, behind Bayern and RB Leipzig, with six wins from ten games.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","What's the real reason Lionel Messi left Barcelona? Answers demanded of Joan Laporta as presidential candidate accuses club of 'lying' about financial mess","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/what-real-reason-lionel-messi-left-barcelona-answers-joan-laporta-presidential-candidate-lying-financial-mess/blt387ac7b30edb6c6b","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 15:47:21 GMT","

Barcelona presidential hopeful Xavier Vilajoana has accused Joan Laporta's board of “lying” about the club's financial situation and called for transparency over Lionel Messi's 2021 exit. A new independent report commissioned by the former board member claims that Barca's debt has ballooned to €4.12 billion, sparking questions about the club's claims of economic recovery and whether Messi's departure was really driven by finances at all.

The foundations of Laporta's presidency have come under renewed fire following the publication of the “Economic X-ray of FC Barcelona (2005-2025)” report - a detailed, independent analysis presented at the Foment de Treball headquarters in Barcelona. Commissioned by Vilajoana, a former Barca director and now potential presidential challenger, the study paints a worrying picture of the club's financial trajectory. According to the report, Barcelona's total debt has reached €4.12 billion, the highest in European football history, marking a 293% increase since 2021.

It directly challenges Laporta's long-standing narrative that his administration “saved” the club from economic collapse. The report claims that even excluding the Espai Barca project €2.82 billion, operational and financial debts still exceed €1.3 billion - more than what Laporta inherited from Josep Maria Bartomeu's regime.

Perhaps most damningly, it accuses the club of using €929 million from asset sales (TV rights, Barca Studios, VIP seats) to finance everyday operations rather than long-term recovery - a strategy that Vilajoana calls “deceptive and unsustainable.”

As pressure mounts, Vilajoana has demanded answers from Laporta, insisting that the club's financial story has been “twisted to mislead members.”

Speaking during the report's presentation, Vilajoana issued a scathing assessment of how the Laporta administration has handled finances, membership relations, and transparency.

He accused the board of covering up a worsening financial situation, saying: “In these four years, Laporta has sold nearly €900 million of inherited assets. Without that inheritance, accumulated losses would already exceed €1 billion, a figure equivalent to the total value of the current first-team squad.

“The economic data reveal a situation far more delicate than the president has publicly admitted. The study detects accounting manipulation practices intended to present a recovery that does not match the Club's financial reality.

“In total, more than €380 million would have been included in the accounts without a real basis, altering the perception of debt and results. These operations do not reduce actual debt; they only hide it. Pretending the numbers balance is not saving the club, it is deceiving it.""

Among the most striking claims in Vilajoana's report is the suggestion that Messi's departure may not have been purely financial. The former Barca director called on Laporta to “finally tell the truth” about why the Argentine legend was allowed to leave.

“Messi's departure was based on financial reasons. It was said that the club couldn't afford the best player in the world. If the reason was financial, I don't see it anywhere now,” Vilajoana stated. “Let Laporta tell us the real reason why Messi was let go. Messi should be left alone. The club is his home, regardless of the president. It would be a mistake to try to take over a figure like him.”

He also used the report to highlight cuts to La Masia, which he argues have jeopardised Barcelona's most reliable long-term asset: “Laporta lives off La Masia's successes while reducing investment. Since his term began, he has cut La Masia's investment from €40m to €25m. If we are to learn anything from this economic disaster, it's that La Masia is Barca's best asset.”

While the report sharply criticises the club's leadership, Vilajoana's message was not one of despair but of renewal. He announced that he will formally present his electoral project on November 27, outlining an alternative vision built on transparency, accountability, and youth development. 

“If I run, it will be with the intention of proposing, explaining, and persuading,” he said. “I don't like 'Frankenstein' projects everyone should forge their own path. I'm going to work on mine.”

Closing his address, Vilajoana expressed cautious optimism that the club can recover if leadership changes course: “I'm optimistic because we'll deal with it when we can. Barca has a solution, but it requires will and responsibility. What we can't do is say that everything is fantastic for four years.”

As Barcelona prepare for next summer's elections, the controversy surrounding Messi's departure and Laporta's financial stewardship is certain to dominate the campaign trail. Whether Laporta chooses to respond to the accusations or continue to deflect remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Barca's financial narrative is once again under the microscope.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Auger-Aliassime keeps SF hopes alive with Shelton comeback at Nitto ATP Finals","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/shelton-auger-aliassime-nitto-atp-finals-2025-wednesday","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 15:42:32 GMT","

Felix Auger-Aliassime showcased his trademark indoor brilliance and mental fortitude on Wednesday at the Nitto ATP Finals, where he got up and running with a thrilling comeback win over Ben Shelton.

The 25-year-old came within two points of defeat in a tense second-set tie-break, but he rallied with grit to seal a 4-6, 7-6(7), 7-5 victory after two hours, 25 minutes in Turin. Although Shelton's relentless serve-and-volley pressure posed constant challenges, Auger-Aliassime stayed composed to notch his Tour-leading 20th deciding-set win of the season.

Comeback 👑@felixtennis flips the script on Shelton and becomes the second man to record 40 hard-court wins this season!#NittoATPFinals pic.twitter.com/UY0IizKaCO

“He was playing much better than me at the start,” Auger-Aliassime said. “It's not often that I get broken twice in the first set indoors… It was a weird start, but as the match went on I was finding ways to put returns in the court. Once we engaged in the rallies, I felt like I could win more. You just have to fight, believe, and play the next point the right way.”

With the victory, Auger-Aliassime keeps intact his hopes of reaching the semi-finals at the prestigious season finale for the first time. Having fallen to defending champion Jannik Sinner in his opener, he now sits at 1-1 in the Bjorn Borg Group and will face third seed Alexander Zverev in his final round-robin match on Friday.

There were concerns over Auger-Aliassime's physical state after he suffered an injury scare during his defeat to Sinner, but he silenced those doubts as he moved freely against Shelton. It was in fact the American who took a tumble in the second-set tie-break, in which he threw in a costly double fault on set point to offer Auger-Aliassime a route back in.

“I felt great, physically. We recovered well, did the right things,” said Auger-Aliassime. “Today I was able to play two-and-a-half hours of high-intensity tennis. I have to give him credit, he kept coming up with great serves. When the opponent plays that well, you have to give him credit, but also to myself for staying cool.”

Auger-Aliassime, the No. 8 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, has been a proven threat on indoor hard courts over the years, tallying a record 84 wins in these conditions this decade, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Once he levelled the score against Shelton, he found his groove on serve and ultimately found a way through to improving to 2-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

Shelton will be left to rue missed opportunities as he slips to 0-2 in the Bjorn Borg Group on his debut at the season finale. He lost five consecutive points from 6/3 in the second-set tie-break against Zverev in his first match and hit a series of crucial unforced errors at a similar moment against Auger-Aliassime.

Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski continued to underline their intent at the Nitto ATP Finals on Wednesday, when they secured another clinical victory to move to the brink of semi-final qualification.

The British duo delivered a gritty performance to defeat second seeds Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten 7-6(7), 3-6, 10-7 after one hour, 43 minutes in their second round-robin clash. Salisbury required a medical timeout during the first set but — with strong support of Skupski — maintained his sharp reactions late in the Match Tie-break to extend his winning streak at the prestigious season finale to 12 matches, having won consecutive titles with Rajeev Ram in 2022-23.

“I wasn't feeling my best out there, I think I had a bug overnight, but Neal was great,” said Salisbury. “I didn't have as much energy as normal, but I knew Neal was there to support me. He played great and did most of the work. I'm not sure how we got through that one in the end.”

With their victory, Salisbury and Skupski improved to 2-0 in the John McEnroe Group. They can qualify for the semi-finals later on Wednesday if Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic defeat Christian Harrison and Evan King.

The decisive moment of the match came at 7/7 in the Match Tie-break, when Salisbury guided a forehand return winner past Patten to clip the outer edge of the line. It was one of three consecutive points to win the match and level their Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Heliovaara/Patten at 2-2.

“It was a very good level throughout, there were fine margins,” Skupski said. “We know as a team that we've fought hard all year, and when it comes to tie-breaks, we just fight until the end. We've had crucial matches throughout the year and that's helped us along the way.”

Salisbury and Skupski are making their team debut at the Nitto ATP Finals following a rock-solid 2025 season, during which they reached five finals, including at Roland Garros and the US Open. They now boast a 57-26 record on the year, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, and will face Harrison and King in their final group-stage clash on Friday.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's weekend to forget in Sao Paulo

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Every Max Verstappen overtake

Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto reflect on the different challenges they faced in the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.

Pierre Gasly managed to score in both the Sprint and Grand Prix in Sao Paulo where he finished P10, as his strong run of form in Brazil continued. It was a much-needed confidence boost for Alpine as well, who had not scored since before the summer break.

Gasly started 13th for the Sprint but managed to fight forward to finish eighth, and his performance in the Grand Prix was just an impressive despite a top-10 starting berth.

He was forced to pit early after opting for the soft tyres off the line, and had to work hard to get back through plenty of traffic and climb back into the top 10.

With two cars one-stopping and creating a DRS train, Gasly finished just three tenths of a second ahead of Alex Albon for a very hard-fought point. While his tally of two points for the weekend did not have an affect on the Championship, with Alpine still rooted to the bottom of the table, it was a good boost for a team that have been up against it this season.

And for the Frenchman, it was just reward for two strong drivers – the sort he has put in without recognition at the back of the field weekend in, weekend out.

“I'm very, very happy. We hadn't scored a point on a Sunday since Spa before the summer break, so it has been a long three months, and this weekend, we just had a good car,” Gasly explained.

“We managed to score one point in the Sprint and another point on Sunday, which was pretty difficult, so I'm pleased.”

He then elaborated on the midfield battle, with the Frenchman getting to fight with Isack Hadjar more than once – something he was happy with, despite his fellow Frenchman eventually finishing ahead.

“It was a tough battle with Isack. I managed to dive twice into Turn 1. Unfortunately, he was getting me back every time on the straight before Turn 4, so I spent quite a lot of time thinking I'm going to have nightmares about that VCARB rear wing!

“But I think overall, they were fighting for – they got a podium this year? – they have been pretty strong this year, and just to be in that mix showed we had a good car this weekend.”

Gasly scored his maiden podium at Interlagos in his Toro Rosso days, and finished on the rostrum last season for Alpine – despite the team once again having a relatively uncompetitive car. While the track has been a happy hunting ground for Gasly, this year's result he credited to the car.

“For sure, Brazil is treating me well, but the car was just on another level compared to the last three months. So, we've just got to understand exactly why and from now, enjoy the good weekends. Hopefully we can repeat that again.”

As for Franco Colapinto, the Argentine racer had a very up and down weekend after the announcement that he was staying at Alpine for 2026. A heavy crash in the Sprint was the low point, but his fate in the race was largely out of his control after he was hit from behind at the start by Lewis Hamilton.

Colapinto did not blame the Ferrari man for a tricky race where he finished 15th, but saw the moment where he spun off in the Sprint as the turning point.

“I think definitely after the Sprint race, we were on the back foot a bit and just struggled as a team on my car, on my side of the garage. I struggled more as I kind of lost the pace that I had on Friday. It was easier to fix the little things on Friday, and we were in a good position already in the Sprint, then everything became a little bit more difficult.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's weekend to forget in Sao Paulo

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Every Max Verstappen overtake

A 10-second penalty for a collision left Oscar Piastri down in fifth at the chequered flag in Brazil.

McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella believes that Oscar Piastri's penalty for a collision with Kimi Antonelli during the Sao Paulo Grand Prix was ""definitely on the harsh side"".

The Australian could only finish fifth in Sunday's 71-lap race, having been forced to serve a 10-second penalty during his first pit stop after the stewards deemed him responsible for the collision with Antonelli.

Piastri had moved to the inside of Antonelli at Turn 1 immediately following a Safety Car restart, but the pair made contact, with the Mercedes driver sent into the side of Charles Leclerc's Ferrari, who had tried to pass around the outside.

The resulting collision initially allowed Piastri to move up to second, behind team mate and eventual race winner Lando Norris, but with Leclerc forced to retire the penalty eventually dropped him back in the final result.

""In terms of the penalty, I would say that [it was] definitely on the harsh side,"" said Stella.

""It's true, we see a little lock-up, but at the same time, he's able to maintain the trajectory, which is ultimately what counts.

""I think the responsibility should be shared with Kimi, because Kimi kind of knew that Oscar was on the inside and the collision probably could have been avoided.

""Perhaps Kimi was also worried of having Leclerc on the outside. A difficult situation, obviously, a difficult situation, but I think overall the penalty is harsh for Oscar to be considered fully to blame for this incident.

""At the same time, now it's done. So, like I reiterate, the respect that we have for the stewards, we accept it, we move on.""

Piastri lost further ground to Norris in the title race and sits 24 points behind with just three Grands Prix and a Sprint remaining, having not stood on the podium for five races.

The 24-year-old has struggled for pace lately, especially compared to his form at the start of the season and in comparison with Norris more recently, but Stella was content with Piastri's performance in Brazil.

""From a pace point of view, I think the pace was quite encouraging in the second and third stint,"" added Stella.

""In the first stint, Oscar was carrying some damage on the tyre that was locked and he was also kind of thinking that the stint would have been long, but in the second and the third stint, I think the performance was good.

""Just talking right now with Oscar, some of the adaptations that we talked about in these low grip conditions, I think he was able to execute them during the race.

""So, I think we take away from this event encouraging indications from a performance point of view and race pace point of view.""

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's weekend to forget in Sao Paulo

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Every Max Verstappen overtake

Yuki Tsunoda conceded that ""nothing worked"" as he suffered ""one of the worst weekends"" for Red Bull at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.

Yuki Tsuonda was left scratching his head after what he called “one of the worst weekends” in Brazil.

Red Bull endured a difficult time in Brazil, with Max Verstappen's drive from pit lane to podium on Sunday adding some much-needed gloss.

For Tsunoda, however, there was no such reprieve, as early contact with Lance Stroll earned him a 10-second penalty, while he then earned a second sanction for failing to serve the penalty correctly, before crossing the line last of the classified finishers in P17.

“It's just a shame,” reflected Tsunoda. “Literally, nothing worked this weekend. When something works, something didn't work at the same time.

“One of the worst weekends. I don't know why. We just struggled with the grip overall, and that's it.”

Of the contact that had sent Stroll into a spin, Tsunoda added: “I don't know. It's a shame about the contact. I didn't notice that I even had contact, so I'm sorry for him. That's it.”

Tsunoda is believed to be fighting for his Red Bull future, with Racing Bulls driver Isack Hadjar rumoured to be in the frame for a promotion.

While attempting to take what positives he could from Tsunoda's performance, Red Bull Team Principal Laurent Mekies agreed with his driver's assessment of the weekend.

“Of course, it's a bit unfortunate,” he said. “He lost a lot of time in that contact, got the extra 10 seconds penalty, then we made a mistake on our side, we got another 10 seconds extra penalty.

“So, it's a shame, it doesn't seem to be going our way. His last stint in clean air is strong. You can do it yourself, if you take the race plot and remove these 2 x 10 seconds, you actually end up in a decent fight for points.

“But again, it's the same thing, would and should don't win races, so we can only pocket the last strong stint in clean air that he has done.”

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Every Max Verstappen overtake

Ahead of a wave of new technical regulations being introduced in 2026, Red Bull and Racing Bulls will hold a joint launch event alongside Ford.

Red Bull and Racing Bulls have announced a joint season launch alongside Ford ahead of the 2026 campaign.

At the United States home of Ford in Detroit, Michigan, on January 15, the two teams will unveil their respective liveries for the next generation of cars, a season in which Red Bull Ford Powertrains will debut as both squads' power unit manufacturer.

Red Bull have chosen Detroit to pay homage to Ford's heritage ahead of the partnership's maiden season together.

Laurent Mekies, CEO and Team Principal of Red Bull Racing, said: ""The launch of the Red Bull Ford Powertrains era represents not only a bold step into the future, but a powerful expression of what's possible when world-class engineering, innovation, and passion come together.

“To see the energy, precision, and scale behind this project is inspiring. It's the culmination of several years of collaboration between two great names in motorsport. We're incredibly excited to begin this new chapter, driven by the same determination and excellence that defines both Ford and Red Bull.""

Jim Farley, President and CEO of Ford Motor Company, added: ""Since we announced our return to F1 with Red Bull, the Ford team have been working night and day to get ready for 2026. But this is about so much more than just the racing.

“It is about how we use our learnings from F1 to make our cars and trucks better for our customers. What we will learn together with Red Bull will define the technologies of the future and that is what excites me most about this relationship.""

Peter Bayer, CEO of Racing Bulls, said: ""We're incredibly excited to welcome Ford back into the world of Formula 1. With over 125 years of heritage, innovation, and absolute dedication to performance, Ford embodies the same competitive spirit that drives our team.

“This partnership brings together global brands united by a love of racing and a commitment to pushing boundaries.

“As a member of the Red Bull family and together with our title partners, Visa and Cash App, we see huge opportunities to join forces and connect with a new generation of fans and showcase the future of performance and mobility on a global stage. Launching this new era in Detroit, the birthplace of Ford, makes it all the more special.""

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's weekend to forget in Sao Paulo

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Every Max Verstappen overtake

Kimi Antonelli scored the best result of his fledgling Grand Prix career with second place in the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, earning high praise from Mercedes Team Principal Toto Wolff.

Mercedes Team Principal Toto Wolff has hailed the podium-winning drive of Kimi Antonelli at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, after the rookie fended off title-chasing Max Verstappen in the closing stages.

Antonelli registered his best Grand Prix finish on Sunday, crossing the line second to Lando Norris at Interlagos. The result continued a return to form following a difficult European leg of the season.

Asked if this was the Italian's most complete weekend to date, Wolff said: “I think all weekend it was strong, from the get-go. It's good to see. Maybe it was coming to a track that he didn't know.

“It's a bit easier. Expectations. Expectations are maybe lower.

“Maybe pressure is not as high as some of the [European races], and then the execution was faultless at the end. You know, being able to fend off, fight off Max on the newer, fresher tyre, that was really strong and a testament as to what is to come.”

As to why Antonelli has found form away from Europe, Wolff added: “I think it's a development. Next year he will come to these tracks that he knows without expecting to kill it. And that's the learning year, the year that we always expected to come with all the ups and downs. Today is an up, definitely. A good moment. There will be more difficult ones.

“Let's see the next three races. I think we're seeing the young boy becoming the young man and performing.”

With Antonelli second and George Russell fourth in Brazil, Mercedes took a stride towards securing second in the Teams' Standings, with Red Bull falling 32 points back, and Ferrari 36, although Wolff remained pragmatic when assessing the table.

“You can see how quickly it goes,” he said. “You have a weekend where you have a double DNF like [Ferrari] had and the other teams scoring strong enough points. The 30-point swing, you can have it in the other direction too in any of the three races.

“So, we just need to keep both feet on the ground, hopefully consolidate the gap and just take it day by day, weekend by weekend.”

While Antonelli was battling in the closing stages, Russell was defending from Oscar Piastri to preserve his top-four result.

“That is how Formula 1 should be, fighting for positions whether you are the back guy or the defending guy,” said Wolff. “I'm really proud of the job both of them did. Kimi's P2 is obviously a shining light here, but George defending from Piastri in exactly the same way is something I enjoyed witnessing.

“Energy management was great. Between the engine guys, the race engineers and the driver we tried to optimise energy harvesting and energy deployment in the best possible way, and use all we had on the main straight and saving energy in the other parts and that was a big part of us not losing that race.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's weekend to forget in Sao Paulo

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Every Max Verstappen overtake

Sebastian Vettel gave his take on the current situation at Red Bull – and the chances of him taking on a role within the sport in the future – during his visit to the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.

Sebastian Vettel has admitted that previous talks for him to potentially take on a position within Red Bull “never gained any traction”, though the four-time World Champion conceded that he is open to the possibility of returning to the sport should the “right opportunity” present itself.

Since retiring from F1 at the end of 2022 – bringing an end to a career that brought four World Championships, 53 wins and 299 Grand Prix starts – Vettel has focused on raising awareness for various causes, with a particular focus on the environment.

However, the 38-year-old – who was promoting the F1REST project whilst attending the Sao Paulo Grand Prix over the weekend – continues to follow Formula 1 and, during an interview with Sky Sports F1 at Interlagos, gave his take on the sudden exit of Red Bull's former Team Principal Christian Horner in July.

“Surprised,” Vettel said of his reaction to the news regarding the team that he won all four of his titles with between 2010 and 2013. “Christian has been there for so long, since the very beginning, and knows this team inside out. I think for this year everything was in place.

“I know Laurent [Mekies] as well, the successor, and I've worked with him and he's a really, really great person, but I think Christian left some big footsteps. Not just because of all the success he's had with the team, but also I think he was such a central part of the team – he knew what was going on and so on.

“I'm not completely aware of the organisation, the structure, and especially the plan for the future, but that's where I think it's valid to say, let's wait and see how it turns out.”

Pushed on whether he himself could be part of that future, Vettel – who was previously linked to potentially succeeding Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko – responded: “I don't know, I read as well there was a lot of talk about it and so on, and I did speak with Helmut a little bit, but it never got anywhere, never gained any traction.”

While Vettel is enjoying his current situation post-retirement, the German has not ruled out the chance of taking on a position within the F1 world one day.

“I think for me, I'm fairly happy where I am in life right now,” he explained. “I love Formula 1. In the beginning I thought, I'm not sure whether I want to keep watching because I need to get a distance and so on.

“But I watch the races and I follow, and I love it because I just love the sport. I know the guys as well so I'm still close in that way.

“I don't know, if the right opportunity, position, perspective, whatever, turns up or could turn up, maybe there's a role that I could be happy to step up to. Time will tell.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's weekend to forget in Sao Paulo

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Every Max Verstappen overtake

Liam Lawson and Isack Hadjar showed strong pace in Sao Paulo for Racing Bulls as both reached the points.

Racing Bulls enjoyed a strong Sao Paulo Grand Prix last weekend, with both Liam Lawson and Isack Hadjar finishing in the points to keep the team in the hunt for P5 in the Teams' Championship.

Lawson – who's future in the sport is yet to be confirmed for 2026 – finished seventh, having utilised a one-stop strategy in Sunday's 71-lap race, ending up directly in front of Hadjar as the pair led a train of five other cars within three seconds over the line.

""Very happy, it's been a great weekend. A very hard race, honestly, but we had to make something work after the first couple of stops,"" said Lawson, who was slapped with a five-second penalty in Saturday's Sprint for a collision with Ollie Bearman.

""It's always tough when you're the second car because obviously, the first car gets priority, and I lost a couple of spots on the first stop and would have lost more on the second one. So we went for the one stop, and it just worked.

""It's an important part of the year, for sure. We're all obviously putting maximum effort in to try and score as high as we can.

""But honestly, for me, it doesn't really change much [about my future]. I think every time I get into the car, I try to drive as fast as I can. I left it all out there today, and it's paid off.”

Hadjar, meanwhile, was left frustrated, having dropped down from a P5 starting position, but the double-points finish for Racing Bulls means they reduced the gap to Williams in the Teams' Championship down to just 29 points.

The team also now sit 10 points ahead of Aston Martin in the standings with three Grands Prix and one Sprint remaining this season.

""Starting fifth and finishing eighth, definitely is a bad result,"" said Hadjar. ""Still a good amount of points for the team, but I was sleeping on the first stint really. Then, after that, the rest was good but a costly mistake.

“Lots of learning. Honestly, I'm happy we're back in the mix. Still, the Haas looks very fast since the last couple of races, but we will give it our maximum.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's weekend to forget in Sao Paulo

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Every Max Verstappen overtake

Nico Hulkenberg scored two points in Sao Paulo after Sauber ran a successful one-stop strategy at Interlagos.

Nico Hulkenberg praised the gamble to run a one-stop strategy at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, which aided his recovery to a points-scoring finish.

Hulkenberg's ninth-place finish in Brazil marked his second top-10 result in three weekends.

Having dropped places at the start, the German found himself stuck behind Alex Albon's Williams, but the Sauber pit wall stuck to its guns, sticking with its one-stop plan in a bid to recover lost ground.

Bringing home two points while Albon took the flag in 11th after pitting twice, the gamble paid off.

“It was a decent race,” said Hulkenberg. “Lap 1 was sub-optimal – I lost a couple of positions, and that was obviously difficult then to recover, because I was stuck behind Alex for quite a long time in the first stint.

“But we pulled off the successful one-stop, really stretched out the stint on the soft and had some good fun battling with the RBs [Racing Bulls] and some other guys, so it was good.

“But in the championship fight, we lost some ground to some competitors, which is not great, but it is what it is. Now, we reset, regroup, obviously a weekend off, and hopefully, a strong one in Vegas.”

Explaining Hulkenberg's strategy, Team Principal Jonathan Wheatley said: “We pretty much stuck to our plan A with Nico. I'd like to look at the data again; I think we boxed him a little bit early onto the soft, which made our lives a little bit difficult at the end.

“But we did think he'd get through Liam [Lawson] a bit quicker than he did. But altogether an outstanding race from Nico, and I think the team read the tyres well. Nico drove a very measured race, brought the compounds in nicely, looked after the soft well; we thought we'd be P7 for a while, but there you go.”

The NBCUniversal spinoff has rights to NASCAR, the PGA TOUR, Premier League, WWE, WNBA, USGA, R&A, LPGA Tour and PGA of America events, among others.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	There's a new sports TV player in town: USA Sports.


Versant, the forthcoming cable channel spinoff from NBCUniversal, says that it will be branding its live sports programming across USA Network, Golf Channel and CNBC under the USA Sports brand name.




	The new branding features a red and black colorway and will lean into the brand identity of USA Network, which houses most of the company's flagship sports content. Golf Channel will be keeping its name, but will get a new logo next year.

	USA Sports will have some 10,000 hours of sports programming, between studio shows and live events, in 2026. The company's rights portfolio includes NASCAR, WNBA, WWE, PGA Tour, Premier League, the LPGA Tour and USGA events, among others.

	











	“Our new USA Sports brand and division name leans into USA Network's decades-long reputation as a top national sports and entertainment network,” said Matt Hong, president of USA Sports. “Our diverse portfolio of sports properties and programming across our platforms highlights top-tier global leagues and amplifies major events throughout the sports landscape. USA Sports has something for all sports fans across the country.”


	USA Sports is leaning heavily into women's sports as a focus point for its efforts, betting that the organic growth in the marketplace, as well as interest from marketers, can become a driver for the business. The company inked its own 11-year rights deal with the WNBA, alongside NBCUniversal, which will retain many of its rights, and it inked a deal for League One Volleyball, hoping that the emergent sport can help it stand out.

	











	Corporate changes have forced some sports rebrands in the past. Most recently, Warner Bros. Discovery changed its WBD Sports division into TNT Sports, also taking the name of its most high-profile channel. Versant will also be changing the name of MSNBC to MS NOW later this week, another side effect of the spin (though CNBC will be able to keep its name, for now).


	NBCUniversal's Versant spinoff is slated to be complete in early 2026, with Versant to be publicly traded as a standalone company.

In the lead-up to 'Being Eddie,' the star spoke with The Hollywood Reporter to reflect on his inimitable path: ""There are things that I've done that nobody else could do."" 


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


Eddie Murphy is celebrating 50 years in show business with an inside look at his storied career.


	The comedy legend goes under the microscope for the Netflix documentary Being Eddie, set to begin streaming Nov. 12. Director Angus Wall's film chronicles Murphy's path from a young stand-up to a teenage castmember of Saturday Night Live to the movie star known for Beverly Hills Cop, The Nutty Professor and Shrek. The documentary features interviews with Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Jerry Seinfeld, Dave Chappelle, Tracee Ellis Ross, Chris Rock and many others.

	During an interview with The Hollywood Reporter to promote the film, the star opens up about putting previous beefs behind him. That includes patching things up with director John Landis — who appears in the doc — and also with the SNL team for his 2019 return as host. Murphy reveals the colorful way he envisions accepting a potential honorary Oscar and teases the forthcoming reboot that he's most excited to tackle — if the finished script ever arrives.




			Related Video		







Given that you're fairly private, what made you decide to do Being Eddie, and were there off-limits topics or guidelines you wanted to set? 


	There were no guidelines. It wasn't going to be this type of documentary. [When] it started out, I was going to do stand-up comedy again. In 2011, I stopped making movies for about six years. When I got off the couch, I was like, “Let's do Dolemite [Is My Name], and go back to Saturday Night Live, and do stand-up.” We were going to do this documentary just to show what it's like to put a [stand-up] show together. Then COVID hit, and everything shut down. Afterwards, I was like, “I'm not sure if I want to do stand-up,” because I was paranoid about COVID. We worked on this thing for five, six years, and now, coincidentally, it's my 50th year in show-business — a milestone for anybody in any business.

	











The documentary teases your potential return to stand-up after all these decades. Are you getting close to doing a special or a tour? 


	I'm open to the idea of doing stand-up again. I got to be having fun for it to work, so if it hits me like that, I'll go right up there and do it.


In the film, you talk about your stand-up shows having felt heavily scrutinized once you were famous. Given the debate in recent years about cancel culture, how do you feel about the stand-up landscape? 


	I can't think of a comedian that said a joke that made them get canceled. I feel like that whole canceled thing was just a moment in time where people were like, “Comics have to be careful what they say.” If you go into clubs, the comics are talking crazier than ever. They say whatever the fuck they want to say. It's a generation that's coming up now that's defiant about that whole cancel culture shit: “Fuck that cancel culture shit. Let the chips fall where they may.” If I ever did it again, I would say what I wanted to say and do whatever I wanted to do. I'm not even thinking about getting canceled at 64, after 50 years in the business.


When I worked at Playboy, one of our most popular interviews from over the years was yours [from 1990], where you discussed tensions with John Landis. Given that he's in the film, have you two put any disagreements in the past? 


	That heat that I had with John Landis 35, 40 years ago, that's so long ago. I love John, and he directed two of the best movies of my career — Trading Places and Coming to America. For years, we've had no heat whatsoever. We even did a movie after that shit. John Landis directed Beverly Hills Cop III. The movie sucked, but we were buddies after. (Laughs.) 

	











You talk about not having won an Oscar, and there are a lot of people who feel you should have won for Dreamgirls. It bothers me when talented comedians have to leave comedy to get critical recognition. 


	I never went like, “They didn't take me seriously because I'm a comedian.” I don't even think like that. There are things that I've done that nobody else could do. Nobody else could do Nutty Professor. With Jim Carrey, nobody else could do The Grinch. To me, the performance in The Grinch is just as amazing as Robert De Niro in Raging Bull. I know comedians that blow dudes off the stage that have got Oscars.


Among your projects in the works is a potential reunion with your Dreamgirls director Bill Condon for a George Clinton movie. Is awards recognition still on your mind?


	What's on my mind is just doing good stuff and only doing stuff that I'm going to have fun doing. I don't think about winning trophies. I got a bunch of trophies. I got everything but an Oscar, and I'm not like, “This is going to get the Oscar.” The fact of the matter is, if I never win an Oscar, eventually they'll give me one of those honorary Oscars when I'm 90 years old. If they made me wait that long, I'm going to wear a sky blue tuxedo, and when they give me the Oscar, I'm going to urinate on myself while I'm giving a speech. (As an old man:) “This is a wonderful moment here.” See all the piss coming down, and they're going to play the music to make me stop pissing, and it's just going to make me piss even more. I'm just going to piss all down. They have to come take me off the stage. If they made me wait to 90, that's what I'm going to do. So they got to give me one. Otherwise, the whole thing has no credibility. 

	











I'm sure you have younger fans who may know you best for Shrek, and now we have Zendaya joining for Shrek 5. How has it been to revisit Donkey? 


	I've always said I would do Shrek forever. Donkey is a great character to play. I love the whole cast. So I was excited when it was like, “Hey, they're doing another one,” and they want to do a Donkey one, too. I'm totally into it. I come in too hot, every vocal session.


You mention in the documentary that it takes a lot out of you.


	You have a headache after a Shrek session. The donkey has a lot of singing. You're on 10, and you're doing it over and over again. The great thing, though, is it's appreciated. Everybody loves the movie. Nothing's worse than working really hard on something, and doing makeup and sweat and all this shit, and then you put it out, and they'd be like, “Two thumbs down.” You go, “I was in the makeup chair for 50 hours!” (Laughs.)


I know you've been hoping to revive the Pink Panther franchise. Have you spoken to your Bowfinger co-star Steve Martin for advice on that? 


	No, but I'm looking forward to putting my spin on it. See, I associate Pink Panther with Peter Sellers.


Of course.


	He's the original Pink Panther, and it turned into this cool thing. Other comic actors have played it, and it'd be cool to put a new spin on it. There's been a few movies in my career where it was like, “OK, I'm doing this movie because no Black person has ever done a movie like this.” It was like, a Black Dr. Dolittle? So I had to do this movie. [And] they had no Black Inspector Clouseau. That's like a Black James Bond to me. I'm just looking forward to going into this area that nobody else Black had been in before.

	











Are we getting close to production on that?


	I'm waiting on the script. (To a nearby associate:) You said that script was coming in October, and it's Nov. 3. What happened to Pink Panther? (Back to the interview:) You heard it? She said it's really close. (To his associate:) Where's Mad, Mad World, too? You said that was coming in October.


What's that one?


	A reboot [of 1963's It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]. This has been in development for, shit, almost 15 years. They can never get the script right. But right now, we got the two writers that wrote The Pickup, and they wrote the Donkey [spinoff movie] — these writers are super hot and super smart — and supposedly they're really close on A Mad, Mad World. I'm cautiously optimistic because we've been in development for so long. That's the pet project. That's the one I want to do more than anything.


We see your home's retractable roof in the documentary. Do you have to worry about bird shit?


	Just recently, we had some shit on the carpet [under] the roof. Every now and then, a bird will fly in the house. (Laughs.) Other than that, the roof is no problem. Every now and then, some shit on the carpet. Somebody come in the room and say, “There's a bird in the living room.” Oh, shit. (Laughs.)

The workplace sitcom follows two best friends, voiced by creator George Gendi and Javone Prince, who work at a ""we're-gonna-save-the-planet type company called Ecofood,"" according to the plot synopsis.


							By 

	Lily Ford



	A London-set adult animated comedy Living the Dream is coming to Netflix.


	From the BAFTA-nominated George Gendi (Gumball, Apple & Onion) and Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe, the eight-part Living the Dream follows best friends Des and Ray, “a couple of really cool guys from London who should have made it big by now but haven't but still could.”




	“Instead,” reads a plot synopsis, “they're stuck at a we're-gonna-save-the-planet type company called Ecofood, doing ‘social media' for hardly any money. Now they must navigate awkward workplace romance, HR blunders, directives from the L.A. office and Ray's dad's disapproval. Could be worse, but could be much, much better.”

	The show's voice cast includes Gendi, Javone Prince, Tom Stourton, Ellie White, Chris Diamantopoulos, and Stavros Halkias, as well as Gavin and Stacey‘s Julia Davis and One Day star Ambika Mod.


	Gendi said: “If living the dream is being asked for a quote for a press release to announce my new show and then at Netflix's request, trying to make it more cheeky/funny and then doing that countless times because none of them are good enough, then I've made it. Anyway, let's see if they let me use this one.”


	Executive producers on Living the Dream are Sam Register (Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go!) and Sarah Fell and Daniel Lennard (The Wonderfully Weird World of Gumball, The Heroic Quest of the Valiant Prince Ivandoe).


	Ireland's Boulder Media is the animation studio behind the series. In addition to Gendi, writers on the series include Phoebe Walsh, Ellie White, Joe Parnham and Joe Markham.

The Hamilton highlights album takes the stage and hits No. 1.


													By
												

	Keith Caulfield



	It's rare that the original Broadway cast recording of Hamilton: An American Musical is not No. 1 on Billboard's weekly Cast Albums chart. (After all, it's been No. 1 for 454 weeks out of the 528 it has been on the chart since its debut in 2015.) So when Hamilton is not No. 1 — as is the case this week — it's notable.

	











	But the title that bumps Hamilton down to No. 2 this week is actually another album related to the show. A 10-song highlights edition, Hamilton: 10 Shots, arrives at No. 1 on the Nov. 15-dated chart, with 17,000 equivalent album units earned in the United States in the week ending Nov. 6, according to Luminate.


	The original Hamilton debuted at No. 1 on the Cast Albums chart dated Oct. 17, 2015, and has never left the chart.


Hamilton: 10 Shots was issued as a streaming set, digital download, CD and on an array of vinyl variants. It also debuts on a number of other Billboard charts: No. 3 on Vinyl Albums, No. 5 on Indie Store Album Sales, No. 6 on Top Album Sales, No. 6 on Top Current Album Sales and No. 28 on the overall Billboard 200.


	Meanwhile, as for the original Broadway cast recording of Hamilton, it is No. 69 on the latest Billboard 200, spending its 528th consecutive week on the chart. It extends its record for the most weeks on the chart ever for a cast recording. It peaked at No. 2 in 2020, marking the highest-charting cast recording since Hair hit No. 1 in 1969.

	











	The Billboard 200 and Cast Albums charts rank the most popular overall albums, and cast recordings, respectively, of the week in the U.S. based on multimetric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album.

			By Justin Kroll, Andreas Wiseman 


EXCLUSIVE: It's been nearly a decade since Tom Ford directed a film but it looks like the multi-hyphenate has zeroed in on his next project and lined up an all-star ensemble to lead the film. 


	Sources tell Deadline Ford has confirmed that he will direct an adaptation of the Anne Rice (Interview With The Vampire) novel Cry To Heaven. The screenplay has been written by Ford, who is also directing and producing through his Fade To Black production company.


	Set in 18th century Italy, the film stars Nicholas Hoult, Aaron Taylor Johnson, Adele (in her movie debut), Ciarán Hinds, George MacKay, Mark Strong, Colin Firth, Paul Bettany, Owen Cooper, Daniel Quinn-Toye, Hunter Schafer, Josephine Thiesen, Thandiwe Newton, Theodore Pellerin, Daryl McCormack, Cassian Bilton, Hauk Hannemann, and Lux Pascal.

	











	The film is currently in pre-production in London and Rome and principal photography is set to begin in mid-January for an anticipated late autumn 2026 release. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	The original Rice novel follows the paths of two unlikely collaborators: a Venetian noble and a castrated singer from Calabria, both trying to succeed in the world of the opera. The story touches on themes of identity, betrayal, love and the pursuit of artistic and personal freedom, all ideas that fall right in Ford's wheelhouse. He has explored these themes in his filmmaking as well in the world of fashion in the past.


	Ford has been eyeing this project as his next film since last year but wanted to make sure the right cast was in place before setting a start date to begin shooting. As for financing, Ford had been talking to several studios but ultimately decided to self-finance the film and shoot on his own terms with plans to take it out to market after production has ended. The former Gucci and YSL creative director sold his Tom Ford fashion label to The Estée Lauder Companies for $2.8BN in 2023.


	The film not only marks Adele's film acting debut, but it also reunites Ford with a handful of actors from past films including Taylor-Johnson, who starred in Nocturnal Animals, and Firth who earned rave reviews and won the Volpi Cup at the Venice Film Festival for his starring role in A Single Man.












	Ford wrote, produced and directed his critically acclaimed first film A Single Man, which launched in Competition at the Venice Film Festival in 2009. The film would go on to earn an Oscar nomination, BAFTA win, as well as the AFI Film of the Year and GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding film.


	Ford's second film Nocturnal Animals won the 2016 Grand Jury prize at the Venice Film Festival and went on to receive nine BAFTA nominations, three Golden Globe nominations, including Best Director and Best Screenplay for Ford, with Taylor-Johnson winning best supporting actor, and an Academy Award Best Supporting Actor nomination for Michael Shannon.


	Ford is repped by CAA.

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


The Devil Wears Prada 2 unveiled its anticipated first teaser on Wednesday morning.


	Set to the tune of Madonna's “Vogue,” the teaser gives nothing away in terms of the sequel's plot, on which 20th Century Studios is still staying mum. It simply features Anne Hathaway‘s Andy Sachs walking into an elevator after Meryl Streep‘s Miranda Priestly, who tells her, “Took you long enough.”


	Following up a beloved 2006 fashion-world dramedy starring Streep, Hathaway, Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci, all of whom are returning, the sequel is expected to examine high-fashion mag editor-in-chief Priestly's perspective as she faces the decline of the print industry.

	











	Based on Lauren Weisberger's 2003 novel of the same name, the original film followed Hathaway's Andy, a journalism graduate, in her experiences after moving to New York City and starting her demanding job as Priestly's junior assistant.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Slated for release in theaters  on May 1, 2026, the sequel also stars Kenneth Branagh, Simone Ashley, Justin Theroux, Lucy Liu, Patrick Brammall, Caleb Hearon, Helen J. Shen, Pauline Chalamet, B.J. Novak and Conrad Ricamora, with Tracie Thoms and Tibor Feldman returning. Lady Gaga is also expected to appear, having been photographed on set.


	David Frankel returned to direct from a script by Aline Brosh McKenna, with Wendy Finerman and Karen Rosenfelt producing. Check out the teaser for The Devil Wears Prada 2 above.

Tom Felton got a raucous welcome as he reprised his role as Draco Malfoy for the first time in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child on Broadway.


	The British actor soaked up rapturous screams and applause for a good 30 seconds before uttering his first line: “I need a favor.” The moment was captured by the Cursed Child‘s official Instagram account. 


	The post was captioned with, “It's true then, what they're saying on the train,” which is a quote from Malfoy in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone when remarking on Potter's arrival at Hogwarts.

	Felton is the first actor from the movie series to join the cast of the stage play, which opened in London in 2016 and on Broadway in 2018. He is expected to carry out a 19-week engagement.


	His casting was announced in June, when Felton said it was an emotional moment. “It's very, very easy to get emotional,” Felton said. “When they put my blond wig on for the theater production, I just immediately cried. It was just sort of like a blast from the past.”


	He continued: “As much as it is reprising an old role for me, it's very much treading into new, unfamiliar territory. I know him quite well as a kid. I don't know him that well as an adult.”

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: In an Absentia reunion, series lead Stana Katic is set to star in Entangled, a drama project created by Will Pascoe who served as executive producer and showrunner on Season 3 of the Prime Video/AXN thriller drama. Entangled is being developed by Jeff Frost, former president of Absentia studio Sony Pictures Television Studios, through his Bristol Circle Entertainment production company.


Entangled is inspired by the story of real-life CIA intelligence officers Meredith and Freddie Woodruff, one of the Agency's first undercover husband-and-wife teams, who conducted their overseas covert operations while also raising a family. Working across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, they tracked down international terrorists, recruited and handled spies and survived a sudden and violent coup in one of the countries they were stationed in.

Frost ran the indie TV studio when the project was developed there and sold to Apple with a two-season order.Pascoe was most recently a co-executive producer on NBC/Peacock's Law & Order: Organized Crime. Other credits include Hulu's Shut Eye and BBC America's Orphan Black. He's repped by Independent Artist Group, Echo Lake Entertainment, and Jackoway Austen.

The tight end, 36, then explained that he didn't do anything special but just “hung out, put the feet up, saw some cool places, ate some great food and got to feel the Big City in its electricity and buzz that it's always gotten.”

“It's my favorite time as the seasons are changing to be around the Midwest and the Northeast. But yeah, it was pretty fun.”

He also pointed out that he got together with some old friends and made new ones. 

“It's cool to just kinda vibe around the city like that,” Travis added. “I think it's one of my favorite things to do in New York, it's just be one with the city and just kinda walk the streets and feel the electricity, feeling everybody doing their own s–t and meeting a few new people along the way.”

Despite not bringing up his time with his fiancée, Travis was seen going on multiple dates with Swift last week. 

On Nov. 5, the two were pictured holding hands as they arrived at The Polo Bar in Manhattan.

The very next night, the “New Heights” co-host and Swift were spotted visiting one of her favorite restaurants, Zero Bond. 

“Bachelorette” alum Jason Tartick later — who was sitting next to them for “two hours” — revealed intimate details about the couple's date night, noting that no one approached them at their table or tried to sneak a photo.

“It was a little disheartening, but also kind of made me curious is knowing the privacy they had in this room, the second they walked outside this club — there was gonna be paparazzi,” he said in a social media video. “After this, two hours of just taking it all in, her electricity, her glow, her light in a room, it's like you just can't stop looking at her.”

He also gushed over how “f–king adorable” Travis and the “Fate of Ophelia” singer, 35, were.

Kelce and Swift are in the midst of planning their wedding after getting engaged three months ago. 

The NFL star popped the question in his backyard after the couple filmed a “New Heights” episode with Jason. 

The two began dating in the summer of 2023 and went public with their relationship by September.

Out with the old, in with the new.

Amy Schumer deleted all of her pre-weight loss photos from her Instagram while sharing new snaps of her slimmed-down figure.

On Tuesday, the comedian shared a carousel of pictures of herself sitting on the stairs and in a swivel chair as she rocked a red strapless mini dress and a pair of black Chanel slingback heels.

“Back on my staircase bulls–t again,” she captioned the post, before thanking her glam team for “hooking a sister up.”

“I actually left my house tonight. Who's proud? I'm feeling good and happy. Deleted my old pics for no reason!” Schumer, 44, added.

The “I Feel Pretty” star's Instagram has been wiped completely clean — except for her new post.

In January, Schumer revealed she dropped 30 pounds while taking Ozempic.

Two months later, she revealed that she was now taking Mounjaro after having a “horrible” experience with Wegovy. 

“Mounjaro's been great,” she said in a now-deleted Instagram video, noting that the medicine isn't covered by insurance unless a patient has diabetes or severe obesity.

“Which most of the internet thinks I have,” Schumer quipped. “But I'm having a really good experience with it and I wanted to keep it real with you about that.”

The “Life & Beth” alum said she tried Wegovy for years but it started to make her constantly throw up.

“I couldn't handle it. I don't know if they've changed the formula, whatever,” she shared.

Recently, Schumer has shown off her new figure in swimsuits and a black mini dresses.

Last month, the “Kinda Pregnant” star put her abs on display while taking a mirror selfie in a pink sports bra and blue sweatpants.

“No filter no filler no clean mirror,” she wrote atop the photo.

Cleto Escobedo III, the leader of Jimmy Kimmel Live!‘s house band, Cleto and Cletones, has died. Escobedo's childhood best friend and longtime collaborator, Jimmy Kimmel, announced the news on Instagram. No cause of death was given. He was 59.

“Early this morning, we lost a great friend, father, son, musician and man, my longtime bandleader Cleto Escobedo III,” Kimmel wrote on Instagram. “To say that we are heartbroken is an understatement. Cleto and I have been inseparable since I was nine years old. The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true. Cherish your friends and please keep Cleto's wife, children and parents in your prayers.”

Born in Las Vegas on August 23, 1966, Escobedo was the son of Celto Escobedo Jr., a Vegas musician who later worked as a backstage butler to Sammy Davis, Jr at the Caesar's Palace Casino. Escobedo Jr. quit playing sax for the job, but at his wife Sylvia's behest, he taught his son to play, starting in the sixth grade. Later, through his father's connections at the casino, Escobedo III got his start in the music industry as a touring saxophonist for Paula Abdul and, later, Marc Anthony. He formed what would become the Jimmy Kimmel house band, Cleto and the Cletones, in 1995.

Escobedo met Kimmel in middle school when Kimmel's family moved across the street from him. The pair bonded over a shared love of David Letterman and used to stay up late watching the show as children. “In 1976 we moved on the same block,” he said in a 2022 interview. “His family moved out from Brooklyn, and we moved from just across town. We just met one day on the street, and there were a few kids on the street, and him and I just became really close friends, and we kind of had the same sense of humor. We just became pals, and we've been pals ever since.” Kimmel had already worked with Escobedo on The Man Show, so in 2003, when the host started putting together the show at ABC, he called his old friend. After co-writing the show's theme song, Escobedo led the band on Jimmy Kimmel Live! ever since.

Escobedo is survived by his wife, Lori, and his two children.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Pope Leo blesses cinephiles with his four favorite films","https://www.avclub.com/pope-leo-four-favorite-films","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 06:03:00 GMT","

Pope Leo XIV has already impressed a lot of people. From pointing out the hypocrisy of the pro-life movement and his empathy for immigrants to his history of enjoying the hot dogs at Weiner's Circle in Lincoln Park, the latest Pope, whose real name is Robert Francis Prevos, has been an exciting and welcome addition to the Vatican City scene. But, outside of “will I get into Heaven?” and “why isn't that guy in Hell?” there's really only one question on his followers' minds: What's in Pope Leo's Letterboxd Four? Sadly, we'll have to settle for his Variety top four.

In an interview with Variety, Pope Leo delivered the heavenly goods. In chronological order, he names It's A Wonderful Life, The Sound Of Music, Ordinary People, and La Vita È Bella (Life Is Beautiful) as his favorite films of all time. He offered no commentary, but they're hardly surprising picks for a guy preaching kindness. Still, if we had to guess, he chose these four so he had something to talk about with all the Hollywood celebrities he's meeting on November 15. After using his ascent to the papacy to finally meet Robert De Niro earlier this week, the new Pope is set to host Cate Blanchett, Spike Lee, Chris Pine, George Miller, Gus Van Sant, Alison Brie and Dave Franco, Viggo Mortensen, American History X director Tony Kaye, and Adam Scott, star of Torque. Look, if we were the Pope, we'd definitely use our newfound global fame to meet Adam Scott, too.

In a statement to the New York Times, the Vatican says, Pope Leo “has expressed his desire to deepen dialogue with the World of Cinema, and in particular with actors and directors, exploring the possibilities that artistic creativity offers to the mission of the Church and the promotion of human values.” The only thing we now must know is, Pope Leo, what'd you get during the Criterion flash sale?

There are many indications that the U.S. economy might be in a recession: Mass layoffs, high inflation, Toy Story 5, to name a few. The problem is that experts likely won't know that the economy is in a recession until we're already in one. It's a wonderful system. But of all the indicators we've seen lately (calling something a recession indicator has become an enjoyable, if fatalistic meme), one theory from author Erin Baldwin of TikTok might be the most convincing—mostly because she brought receipts. Baldwin argues that People‘s Sexiest Man Alive is a recession indicator when they actually pick the right guy, and her math checks out.

“People magazine is very good at picking the right man at the wrong time, but occasionally they do get it right,” Baldwin says in the video. “Every time they've gotten it right, there's been a recession.”



The first time this happened was in 1991, when People selected Patrick Swayze as the Sexiest Man Alive. “Good choice,” Baldwin says. Two years later, People begins a period of “weird choices,” starting with the selection of Richard Gere and Cindy Crawford as the Sexiest Couple Alive. But weird turns out to be good, economically speaking, because the American economy stabilized after Hurricane Swayze. But an overzealous People can't help but make the right choice in 2000, choosing Brad Pitt, fresh off of Fight Club and Snatch, and Pierce Brosnan in 2001, just before he left Bond behind. Both are excellent choices, but unfortunately, they are the Sexiest Men Alive during the 2000 to 2001 recession. And who might you ask was the Sexiest Man Alive in 2009, at the start of the Great Recession? Hugh Jackman.

Of course, the theory is subjective and relies on you agreeing with People‘s choice. But it doesn't bode well for the country that People made the right call and named Jonathan Bailey Sexiest Man Alive last week. “We know, we nailed,” People writes. Oh, how we wish you hadn't.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The toys are back in town, yet again, for Toy Story 5 teaser","https://www.avclub.com/toy-story-5-teaser-trailer","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 00:37:00 GMT","

It was only a matter of time before Pixar skewered the iPad kids. After burning through the children who play with sporks in the surprisingly satisfying Toy Story 4, a LeapFrog Connect clone is the toy du jour concerning Woody, Buzz, Jessie, and Forky this time. Ironically set to the soulful rhythms of The Rolling Stones' 1964 hit “Heart Of Stone,” the new teaser for Toy Story 5 introduces Andy's beloved toys to the future. How quaint the discovery of a spaceman action figure 30 years ago looks in hindsight.

﻿

There isn't much to the teaser, aside from our old friends that neither Pixar nor Disney can put away—as if someone (read: shareholders) had double-dog dared them to make a fourth sequel—observing their new playmate, the “LilyPad,” with horror. But it does indicate one major thing about the film: Woody (Tom Hanks) is back. And while we can't confirm his relationship status with Bo Peep (Annie Potts), with whom he absconded at the end of Toy Story 4, we can surmise that he has since divorced Bo and that no-fault divorce for toys exists in the Toy Story universe. However, while we'd love to see a B-Plot in which a single and mingle-ready Woody downloads Hinge on his child owner's tablet, the movie is actually about Jessie (Joan Cusak) getting the gang back together to eject another new toy from the playroom.

Earlier this summer, at the Annecy Animation Festival in France, Pixar's Chief Creative Officer, Pete Docter, laid out the basic plot. “Toy Story 5, it's toy meets tech. If you remember from Toy Story 4, Woody has left the kids for a life of adventure with Bo and her friends, helping lots of toys in need,” he said. “And Sheriff Jessie is now in charge of Bonnie's room with a recently deputized Buzz Lightyear to assist.” Andy's younger sister and successor to his toy kingdom, Bonnie, is now eight and “more concerned about being socially connected and making friends.” Her tablet, the LilyPad, “can be a little sneaky and prickly because in her mind, to better socialize, Bonnie needs to move on” from her toys./ Faced with a future where Bonnie spends every trip to the restaurant staring blankly at her LilyPad, Jessie springs to action and calls the toys back to town.

Toy Story 5 opens on June 19, 2026.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Ken Burns' The American Revolution is a towering achievement","https://www.avclub.com/the-american-revolution-review-tv-pbs-ken-burns","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

In 1990, a fresh-faced documentarian managed to do the impossible. Over the course of nine September nights on PBS, Ken Burns got millions of Americans excited about their own history with his series The Civil War, which documented in visceral, vital detail the history of that conflict between the states from 1861 to 1865. Many people forgot the basics of the Civil War as soon as they passed or failed a test on them in high school, but Burns' series made one of the most important chapters in history palatable. Perhaps more impactfully, he made it a thrilling and entertaining story that translated the scope, scale, and tragedy of the loss at its core to generations who had not considered it.

It served as a visual reckoning with the photographic evidence of the war—the first to unfold in the age of photography—as he combed through the past and found resonance and alarming warnings for the future. His filmmaking technique of letting the camera slowly crawl across the haunting images of savage battlefields and weary faces in search of century-old detail and depth was so influential that Apple adopted it as an effect in its iMovie program. 

The documentary's debut coincided with the 125th anniversary of the Civil War and highlighted (without alienating the different opinions watching at home) the myriad of ways the deep wounds of it still influenced policy, progress, and basic human decency today. But the series opens with a declarative statement, solemnly spoken to present and future viewers by historian Barbara J. Fields: “If there was a single event that caused the war, it was the establishment of the United States in independence from Great Britain with slavery still a part of its heritage.”

Thirty-five years later, Burns is back to unpack that remark with The American Revolution, a landmark achievement that arrives as the country recognizes the 250th anniversary of that same fight for independence that Fields name-checked. What set the stage for a free country in the making and how did the decisions made two and a half centuries ago lay the bumpy road to the present we live in? Those lofty questions drive the densely packed but never dull six-part series. But don't go in expecting a revelrous tone. In fact, celebration feels like too strong a word for this moment considering The American Revolution arrives in the wake of the longest government shutdown in the nation's history—not to mention during a daily cavalcade of atrocities, indignities, and perversions of the truths first uttered by our Founding Fathers. In other words, the grand experiment of democracy, as the likes of Benjamin Franklin and Geroge Washington considered it to be, is seemingly worse for wear as it nears the big 250. But that is why the series from Burns and co-directors Sarah Botstein and David Schmidt hits so hard. Across its volumes, it isn't afraid to honor the triumphant origin of our national patriotism while also calling out the original sins we still wear the wounds of today.

Clocking in at 12 hours, this thing is a beast. That said, Burns' The Civil War came in at more than 11 hours and his equally riveting The Vietnam War from 2017 (with co-director Lynn Novick) had a whopping runtime of 17-plus hours. But as with his previous war-focused works, Burns has gotten better about making it feel like half that time by parsing out the details of the history-altering conflict at hand with as many personal stories as political ones, as many cultural insights as military maneuvers. To assist, the gang's all here for those who know the hallmarks of a Ken Burns joint: writer Geoffrey C. Ward, narrator Peter Coyote, and a host of recognizable returning voices like Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep, Samuel L. Jackson, Laura Linney, Claire Danes, and (this isn't hyperbole) about 100 others. (You might think the plum Washington role would go to Hanks, but instead, it is Josh Brolin who gives a surly voice to our first president.)

This, however, is where The American Revolution has a steeper hill to climb than its predecessors in Burns' filmography. Almost all of his series drew in history buffs and casual viewers alike with a stunning visual palette of poignant photographs and, for more recent topics, archival footage. (Two great examples are 2007's The War and 2019's Country Music.) But the advent of photography eludes the American Revolution, leaving Burns and his fellow directors to rely more heavily on the voices to propel the story, with an added emphasis on maps, portraits, and digital renderings of a fledgling country's landscape changing in real time. In episode two, an ambush in Canada early in the revolution unfolds with a digital recreation of the movement of troops through the streets of the city. It is an obvious elevation and modernization of Burns' characteristically simple but effective military maps with advancing arrows (though there are still some of those too), but those CGI moments are a noticeable difference for those who worship at the altar of the filmmaker's more practical approach. Still, it never feels like a violation of the storytelling he's famous for. 



In fact, the filmmakers create a masterful narrative of the war's tactical beats interwoven with the human touch and the necessary myth-busting about the cornerstones of our history. An early episode opens with an acknowledgement that America was born out of violence and wars, like those fought against Native communities and eventually conflicts like the revolution. While no one would consider that a particularly hot take, it does fly in the face of our collective image of the fight for independence as one battled by dusty old white guys wearing powdered wigs and signing documents with feather pens. Despite what you learned in catchy songs from the Broadway musical Hamilton, the rooms where it happened only tell half the story. Yes, history was made through big military campaigns but also in socially defiant calls to “Remember the Ladies,” as rallied by Abigail Adams. Burns, Botstein, and Schmidt take time to address the misconceptions of the revolution as simply a verbal sparring match, even if they don't skip the war of words either.

The series also takes its chance to interrogate the idealized version of the Founding Fathers that we continue to let dictate our politics centuries later, a process Burns began in 2022 with his two-part series Benjamin Franklin. Here, a segment about George Washington's ruthless grip on the institution of slavery and the people he owned in its name is just one of the ways the series takes direct aim at the realities of our past that a frightening number of school systems seem hellbent on erasing today. But it should be noted that Burns isn't suddenly confrontational with his filmmaking. In this format, the story is stripped of the political undertone that seems to haunt every corner of American discourse right now. Instead, the series encourages viewers to lean in and engage rather than take an automatic attack stance against our own history because it doesn't serve the message we want it to.

The American Revolution doesn't lead with malicious intent nor does it set out to shatter idyllic truths about our nation for the hell of it. It merely presents the facts about where we came from and the fight that earned us the freedoms that we may or may not be further dismantling with each passing day. The series' staggering detail and engrossing ensemble simply highlight that hindsight isn't 20/20 and molding the future of a country based on the rosier generalities of its past is a perilous endeavor—a lesson we already learned once in the 1700s.

The project won't be for everyone, simply because a 12-hour history documentary—even one this compelling—is not what most people doomscroll for these days. But there's never been a more crucial time to make an exception. With this series airing on the increasingly underfunded and threatened PBS network, Burns' exhaustive and exquisite effort to tell us our own story feels like an endangered species of art and television.  

The American Revolution premieres November 16 on PBS

Jimmy Kimmel is mourning the loss of his lifelong friend, Cleto Escobedo III, the leader of the Cleto and the Cletones, the house band on Jimmy Kimmel Live!

Escobedo tragically passed away on Tuesday, Nov. 11, at the age of 59, Kimmel announced in an Instagram post. This comes after the late-night host postponed his show on Nov. 6 due to a “personal matter.”

The cause of death was not released.

Kimmel and Escobedo grew up across the street from one another in Las Vegas, so when the late-night host first got his show, he made sure that it was Escobedo providing the live music on the show since it first premiered in 2003. 

Kimmel shared a post on Nov. 11 announcing the news. 

“Early this morning, we lost a great friend, father, son, musician and man, my longtime bandleader Cleto Escobedo III,” Kimmel wrote. “To say that we are heartbroken is an understatement. Cleto and I have been inseparable since I was nine years old. The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true. Cherish your friends and please keep Cleto's wife, children and parents in your prayers.”

Many comments were left after Kimmel's sentiments. 

“So sorry to hear this Jimmy. He was AWESOME. Love to his family,” actor Eric Stonestreet wrote.

“❤️❤️❤️ love to u, cleto and his whole family,” Johnny Knoxville commented.

Ahead of the taping for the Thursday, November 6, show, ticket holders were abruptly informed that it was canceled, the New York Post reported. The episode was set to include actor David Duchovny, “Stranger Things” star Joe Keery and singer Madison Beer.

“Due to unforeseen circumstances, @jimmykimmellive needed to reschedule my performance that was originally scheduled to air tonight to a later date,” Beer wrote in a post that same day, confirming the news.

Entertainment Weekly later confirmed that it was due to a “personal matter” involving Kimmel. 

Escobedo's father, Cleto Escobado Sr. is also a member of Cleto and the Cletones, playing tenor and alto saxophones.

In January 2022, Escobedo shared a photo of himself alongside his dad to celebrate nearly 20 years of playing together and performing on television. 

“19 years of this!! Love ya Dad,” he wrote.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","WATCH: Robert Irwin & Witney Carson's DWTS 20th Anniversary Night Dance","https://entertainmentnow.com/dancing-with-the-stars/robert-irwin-dwts-witney-carson-anniversary/","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 17:33:37 GMT","

This week, on the glittering 20th anniversary celebration episode of Dancing with the Stars (DWTS), seasoned pro Witney Carson and wildlife-champion-turned-ballroom-competitor Robert Irwin lit up the dance floor with a birthday-party themed routine that perfectly married flair, emotion and showmanship. As the show marked two decades of sequins and mirrorballs, Carson and Irwin brought a fresh, fun and heartfelt energy—proving that even in the spotlight of a milestone episode, they managed to keep the rhythm authentic and their partnership compelling.

Irwin broke down in tears multiple times immediately after his performance. The couple received tens from all four judges to create a perfect score of 40 out of 40.

Irwin also partnered up with Xochitl Gomez as a part of last night's anniversary episode.

For the show's landmark 20th-birthday episode, DWTS pulled out all the stops—returning pros, a relay round twist, and routines steeped in nostalgia. With stakes high and celebration in the air, Carson admitted to The Hollywood Reporter that this was a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to dance with Robert on such a pivotal episode.

Their performance opened with vibrant party vibes—balloons, flash lighting, and a nod to the show's past, with Carson guiding Irwin through the chart-topping medley of moves. She emphasized how the milestone context gave them a chance to stretch creatively. Meanwhile, Irwin embraced the moment with characteristic positivity, making it clear that for him this dance was more than competition: it was tribute. As a wildlife advocate whose family has long championed conservation, competing amid this celebratory atmosphere added emotional layers.

Witney Carson, now well-established on DWTS, is guided by experience; Robert Irwin, though less polished as a dancer, brings raw energy and authenticity. According to their interview, their dynamic relies on trust and playfulness—Carson guiding, Irwin soaking it in. For their birthday-night routine, Carson let Irwin's personality shine: bits of theatrical flair, a moment of surprise, and a wink to his conservation roots.

Beyond the ballroom, Robert Irwin and Witney Carson shared a charming off-stage moment that captured hearts. At his home base, the Australia Zoo, Irwin introduced a newborn wallaby named “Witney the Wallaby,” in honor of Carson. He presented the gift during a surprise reveal People reports, calling out the “uncanny” resemblance between the wallaby's energetic hops and Carson's dynamic presence. That sweet gesture echoed the spirit of their performance: grounded, genuine, and joyfully unexpected.

Carson's reaction—genuine surprise and delight—added a humanizing moment amid the glitz of DWTS. For Irwin, the move highlighted that his appearance on the show is part of a broader mission: leveraging his platform for wildlife awareness and meaningful connections. For Carson, it reinforced her role beyond choreography—the mentor, the collaborator, the one who helps the story shine. Together in this episode they proved that celebrations, when done with heart, can transcend spectacle.

Prince William brought a royal surprise to the ballroom this week. The future king made a lighthearted cameo on “Dancing with the Stars”, cheering on wildlife conservationist Robert Irwin during the show's 20th anniversary episode.

Prince William surprised fans on Tuesday during “Dancing with the Stars” Season 34. He appeared via video call to support contestant Robert Irwin and his partner, Witney Carson, who performed a Foxtrot to Leona Lewis' “Footprints in the Sand.”

William called Robert “twinkle-toes” and wished the duo luck. He signed off with a friendly wave, leaving both performers visibly shocked. People magazine reported that the moment became an instant highlight online.

Before the call, Robert told his sister Bindi Irwin and her daughter Grace that he had expected to attend Prince William's Earthshot Prize ceremony in Brazil. Instead, he said he had to tell the royal he was “still here” competing on the show. People reported that the family moment made his performance more meaningful.

Robert shared that the song choice carried extra emotion. Bindi danced to the same track during her winning season, dedicating it to their late father, Steve Irwin. “There's a lot of weight,” Robert said during rehearsal. “I really want it to be our best dance yet.”

After an emotional performance, Bindi joined her brother onstage as a photo of their parents appeared on the ballroom floor. Robert ended the dance in tears while the crowd applauded.

Judge Bruno Tonioli said Robert earned a “royal seal of approval.” Carrie Ann Inaba called the performance “powerful and profound.” Derek Hough, who previously partnered with Bindi, said he felt “honored” to be part of the Irwin family's story. He called Robert “this generation's beacon of joy.” Guest Tom Bergeron added that he was “trying not to get choked up,” recalling meeting Robert as a child.

The judges awarded the pair the season's first perfect score of 40 out of 40.

Fans quickly shared their excitement online. Hindustan Times reported that many focused on Carson's stunned reaction when William mentioned Robert by name. Viewers called the cameo “unexpected” and “adorable.”The episode also featured tributes to former contestants and celebrated 20 years of “Dancing with the Stars.” William's cheerful call added humor and heart to a milestone night, reminding audiences that even royals enjoy a good dance moment.

Prince William's warm, playful appearance may be brief, but it turned a regular competition night into one of the show's most unforgettable episodes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","WATCH: Elaine Hendrix & Alan Bersten's DWTS 20th Anniversary Night Dance","https://entertainmentnow.com/dancing-with-the-stars/elaine-hendrix-dwts-alan-berstenanniversary/","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 01:17:47 GMT","

As season 34 of Dancing with the Stars hit its stride, actress Elaine Hendrix brought fresh energy and bold movement to the ballroom when she and pro partner Alan Bersten stepped into a salsa to “It Takes Two.” The routine not only showcased Hendrix's flair and commitment, but also arrived amid a personal journey marked by injury, resilience, and a strong support network. This week's performance became a statement of intent for Hendrix one that fused rhythm, theatricality, and her long-standing passion for dance.

Hendrix faced a turning point earlier in the competition when a rib injury during rehearsal forced her out of a live performance night. She described to The Hollywood Reporter the moment when “my ribs seized up and I couldn't move,” underscoring how even seasoned performers must battle physical setbacks.. The couple receive a 36 out of 40 for their performance tonight. Rather than allowing the setback to define her journey, Hendrix called it “a moment of clarity” that reignited her love for dance. She emphasized to Decider that she's “in it to win it” and dedicated herself to rehab, choreography and studio time with added focus. 

#dancingwiththestars #dwts 

Her return to full-on rehearsal mode paved the way for the salsa to “It Takes Two,” a genre and song choice that demanded both speed and coordination. It served as a triumphant path back from adversity.

Choosing “It Takes Two” was a smart strategic move. The track's infectious energy and hip-hop-inflected beat gave the classic salsa format an extra pop. On the dance floor, Hendrix and Bersten leaned into the fun, with quick feet, dynamic turns and plenty of partner interplay.Hendrix has been vocal about feeling underrated by the scores; she acknowledged that while she doesn't fully understand the scoring criteria, she focuses on judge feedback and fan support instead. That mindset fed into her salsa: rather than chasing perfection, she chased presence. The styling played to her strengths — theatrical flair, confident frame, and an ability to engage the audience. See last week's performance below.

Hendrix emphasized how much her off-floor support has meant: longtime friend and co-star Lisa Ann Walter has attended virtually every show, serving as a “life security blanket” in Hendrix's words. Her partner Bersten echoed that this journey feels bigger than the usual competition arc.Meanwhile, Hendrix and Walter both voiced concern that Hendrix has been underscored by the judges. Walter publicly stated that her friend “deserved more” for recent performances. (US Magazine) The salsa to “It Takes Two,” therefore, carried extra significance — it was not just another dance, but an opportunity to make a statement and reclaim narrative momentum. Hendrix framed it as more than a dance: “This minute is for me, and for anyone who's ever had to push through pain to reclaim joy.”

Consider this juxtaposition: back in 2022, Glen Powell spoke to me about how he had to put his career ascent on hold with the various release delays of “Top Gun: Maverick” — at first, for production reasons; later, like all of us, for pandemic reasons. But, as we would all eventually discover, he knew that he had the goods as hotshot pilot Hangman, it was just a matter of people getting to see the film. 

Smash cut to today, and there's Powell sitting in front of a giant sign that reads “The Running Man.” He's not The Running Man's friend. He's not trying to catch The Running Man. He is The Running Man. (Though, Powell says the smash cuts started long before “Top Gun”; to get a truer sense of his rise, we need to start with “Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over”.) That's not to mention that Powell is also the star and co-creator of Hulu's new football-based comedy, “Chad Powers.”

So, yes, it's a pretty exciting time to be Glen Powell. Which is maybe one reason he recently posted an Instagram photo of himself in a track suit with the caption “I love my life” underneath it. (We'll get back to that.)

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Now, of course, as Powell is clear, it's not that easy. And anyone who has paid attention knows that Powell works his ass off. It's just both so endearing and rare to see an actor know, deep down, he has what it takes to be a movie star, then actually become a movie star in a day and age where there aren't really many movie stars anymore.

As opposed to the 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger film, Edgar Wright's updated version is a pretty faithful adaptation of Richard Bachman's (aka Stephen King) “The Running Man.” In it, Powell plays Ben Richards, a down-on-his-luck husband and father living in the far-flung future of 2025 (a nice little quirk from the original 1982 book) who agrees to participate in a game show, “The Running Man,” that no one has ever won. It's run by a ruthless television executive (Josh Brolin), who doesn't care very much that Ben is taking on the gig so that he can win enough to afford the medication he needs to save his sick daughter's life. All he has to do is hide out for 30 days without getting killed by the masked military agents hunting him down. (Yes, if you haven't noticed, some of the “futuristic” themes of “The Running Man” feel pretty real right now.)

When I spoke to Powell, he was in London, getting ready to fly to New York City for the film's premiere and to host “Saturday Night Live” this coming week. It was a little on the early side where I was, but Powell wasn't really having any of my excuses.

 










The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.

Glen Powell: Grab yourself a cup of coffee and wake up, man. We have an interview to do. What time do you usually wake up?

IndieWire: I guess a little before 10:00 a.m.

You wake up at 10 a.m.?!?! You're going to live forever, man. I wish I had your sleep.

Well, I do have some caffeine right here in my new “Chad Powers” cooler that randomly showed up in the mail… [Gesturing to new “Chad Powers” cooler.]

[Laughs] Yeah, man…

And yes, I'm certainly going to live forever drinking Holiday Creamy Vanilla Coca-Cola Zero first thing in the morning. [Gesturing to new Holiday Creamy Vanilla Coca-Cola Zero in hand.]

I'm also a Vanilla Coke guy. I'm glad you kept the “Chad Powers” cooler.

They sent a hat, too.

You have to rep the Catfish. Don't throw it away.

I'll cherish it forever. I just assumed you designed this.

I had a strong had in designing it. When Michael Waldron and I were first talking about it, the first scene I wrote in that pilot was the scene where Russ gets sprayed in the face with the dirt dauber spray. And I wrote the mascot as a catfish and Waldron was like, “Why are we going with a catfish? Because it's Southern?” And I'm like, “No, catfish as in catfish-ed.” So it's funny how this silly joke has become not just the designing of the uniform, but what the students are wearing and the history of the university. It's been a wild ride.

 










Speaking of wild rides, the other day you posted a picture of yourself in a track suit at a party with the caption, “I love my life.”

[Laughs] Look …

Yeah?

Anyone who knows me knows that was my birthday party.

OK.

I was only in town for a couple of days. We've been sort of on the run here, literally and figuratively. But we got to throw this party, track suits and tequila. I threw this party years and years ago and people still talk about it. So I was like, alright, I'm going to bring it back. It's the first time I've been in L.A. for my birthday in a really long time. It was a hit again! People love it.

It did look like a hit.

Wearing sneakers and track suits? The dance floor is always rocking. No one is uncomfortable.

Here's my controversial take on “The Running Man.” I think “The Running Man” is dangerous and people shouldn't do it.

Well, unfortunately, for every naysayer like you, there's an evil producer out to prove you wrong.

Yes, I am a naysayer.

When there's an audience, there's a way. And I think that's one of the cautionary tales that we talk about in this movie…

Cautionary? Almost everything in this movie is actually happening. It doesn't even feel cautionary.

Stephen King wrote this book in the early 1970s, came out in 1982, it's set in 2025. Even if we made this movie two years ago, it would feel too far into the future. But now in 2025, it's here. Even when we were shooting this, even from a year ago to now, the deep fake technology, you could kind of see the seams of the magic trick. And now I'm seeing videos all the time and I have to look to the person next to me and ask, “Is this real?” That's the world of “The Running Man.” 

 










Talking to Stephen King after he saw the movie, he just lost his mind over it: “This is just a wall to wall, fun, adrenaline-filled action movie, but it's also a movie of our time.” It causes you to reckon with a lot. Where we are and how we ended up here.

Lee Pace's villain is a guy in a military uniform with a mask on, as normal citizens are trying to help your character. This is now stuff we see every day in the news. And I'm not trying to say it's not a fun action movie, it is, but there's also some disturbing stuff in here that's become reality.

It's what makes sci-fi one of my favorite genres. It allows you to separate yourself and just kind of be on the ride watching the movie. People are on the edge of their seat watching this movie, taking it all in because it's relentless. And then I'm getting these calls a day or two later, “We are living in ‘The Running Man.'” And I'm like, yeah.

Arnold Schwarzenegger saw it.

Yeah, that was a week ago, but we finally got to show the world that Arnold loved it. We talked to Arnold before the movie started and we talked to him about our way into the story, which is much more loyal to the Stephen King book.

I'd say the first film doesn't follow the book much at all outside of the concept. This film follows the book very closely.
 










That's exactly right. And Arnold was a fan of the original Stephen King book. But for practical reasons, they had a director switch early on in production…

A lot of people don't realize the first film was directed by Starsky from “Starsky & Hutch,” Paul Michael Glaser.

Yeah! It was actually going to be directed by the director who directed “The Fugitive.”

Andrew Davis, who also directed “Under Siege.”

Yeah, and Starsky directed the film! The interesting thing with Schwarzenegger is, you want to be careful— I haven't had to do this really — but I can imagine it must feel odd when another actor is embodying a character you played. So I like to approach it as a human to human thing. I wanted to talk to Schwarzenegger to make sure he felt good about it and his blessing. But again, exactly what you're talking about, the overlap narratively is very light. We get to follow what Stephen King actually intended in the first place.

Yeah, Jesse Ventura isn't in this one.

No, there is more of an “American Gladiators” sort of swing. Which is just the nature of the studio and the attributes of the character are a little bit more like WWE. Ours is much more like SEAL Team 6.

And Ben Richards isn't forced into it this time. He agrees to do it for money.
 










That's what I also found to be interesting. I always loved the entry point to the Stephen King book. Edgar and I joke about it, it's the most high-octane pharmacy run of all time. This is a guy who leaves his house to sign up for a game show to make enough money to get his daughter some medicine to save her life. And he winds up signing up for an unwinnable game show. 

What I love are the simple stakes of just trying to show up for your family and how this story just kind of like gets bigger and bigger in scope. Which brings the eyes of the world to a guy who is just isolated to this apartment and just trying to take care of the people he loves closest to him and he ends up being a symbol for the word. You get to the end of the movie and you're like, whoa, that was a ride.

I saw you mention you got advice from Tom Cruise about running at night. You refer to him as “TC.” I didn't know that was a thing…

Oh, really? Everybody in his life calls him that.

OK, so if you know Tom Cruise, he's “TC”?

He's TC, yeah. I'll call him Cruise, TC. But yeah, TC is how most people refer to him.

See, I can't call him that, but you can because you know him.

I got to see him the other night. It's so wild the journey he and I have kind of been on together. From starting the journey of “Top Gun” and riding that wave through COVID and figuring out what the theatrical landscape would look like on the other side of it. How he's continually showed up for me in my life as a friend and a mentor — and really, just looking out for me. 

 










It's hard to fathom, movies stars don't do that, right? They don't send the elevator back down and take care of people, for the most part. He's just a very rare type of person who really just wants everybody around him to win.

Speaking of “Top Gun,” it's an interesting smash cut from how you were feeling about your career then, feeling you had something that was going to break through but keeps getting delayed, to right now seeing you sitting in front of a sign that says “The Running Man” and you are playing The Running Man.

Well, there are no assurances. That's the other thing that I find to be really dangerous to forecast too far into the future. With this job, you just kind of take every moment in front of you. Now, you can dream, but the likelihood those dreams come true are very small. It's kind of a hard business to navigate. 

Even when “Top Gun” was being delayed, I knew the movie we had, but it still doesn't guarantee audience reaction or what it will do for you personally. I think that's what made that journey kind of wild is because you want to be really deliberate about the type of movies you do and the people you collaborate with. But, also, you're running out of money. It is a weird jump cut to where we are now. But, again, nothing is guaranteed and I treat every movie like it's my last.

 










I mean, that's true you did know the movie you had. I ran into you on the street after the “Ghostbusters: Afterlife” premiere while we were both trying to get a car and I believe you told me “Top Gun” would “knock my socks off.” And now you're The Running Man.

I always had confidence in the movie. But I have had enough experience, I've been doing this long enough, to know that I've seen other people run the same race that I'm running…

To be fair, I do know you work very hard.

Not to quote Chad Powers again, but to start dancing before you get in the endzone, what happens is you fumble it.

And it gets returned for a touchdown by the other team.

Just career-wise and life-wise, it's fun to dream, but at the end of the day, I think my favorite part of this job is just kind of being present and not looking too far down the field. Kind of going, hey, to make this movie with Edgar Wright, one of my favorite filmmakers of all time? You sort of just bite it off one thing at a time. But for me, I think it's a dangerous thing to get too far over your skis in any capacity. I also think that's a way you're never really living in the here and now with all of it. You're not enjoying the movie you're getting to make with the collaborators. You're too far ahead. Does that make sense?

 










To quote Glen Powell, “You love your life.”

[Laughs] You know the best part about it? Right now, I'm going to see my family tomorrow in New York, we're going to get to do the premiere. I have all my friends coming in town for the premiere and “SNL.” I have to say, the thing I'm really enjoying about showing this movie to even like guys like Robert Rodriguez. I talked to him yesterday and Robert loves this movie. He gave me my first gig…

Right, “Spy Kids”…

And the full circle nature of that? You talk about jump cuts. That is the ultimate jump cut. It's the guy who got let on set for the first time in Austin Studios and never wanted to leave. They literally had to make me leave that set after I shot my one scene I just wanted to hang out and ask people questions … and here we are. It's like, I can't believe the guy who gave me my first gig is even commenting on a movie I get to be on with another great filmmaker. I do love my life! And I get to experience this with my family and my friends. It's as good as it gets.

Next, you're in J.J. Abrams's “Ghostwriter,” and there's not a lot known. How does it end?

How does that movie end?

J.J. Abrams loves people to know the full plot of his movies.
 










Nobody knows the premise of the movie! OK, that's funny.

A Paramount Pictures release, “The Running Man” will be released in theaters on Friday, November 14.

The most interesting thing about the sanitized, fully authorized celebrity biodocs that have been mass-produced during the streaming era — sometimes the only interesting thing about the sanitized, fully authorized celebrity biodocs that have been mass-produced during the streaming era — is that they offer an unusually clear glimpse at how the famous like to think of themselves. 

Often just candid enough to be described as “refreshingly honest” (as Netflix's editorial site declares the company's own portrait of Sylvester Stallone), these feature-length exercises in reputation laundering don't give us a peek behind the curtain so much as they invite their stars to remap their private lives onto a stage that gives them full control of the spotlight. If you don't want people to know who you really are, one of the smartest things you can do these days is to star in a slickly produced documentary about yourself so that people feel like you've already told them.

On that score, Angus Wall's super watchable “Being Eddie” is among the more convincing films of its kind, because instead — or by way — of trying to show us who the real Eddie Murphy is, it commits itself to arguing that Murphy has always known. Indeed, the doc goes so far as to suggest that Murphy's acute self-knowledge is his single most defining trait; that he's only become somewhat inscrutable to us over the years because our perception of him has fluctuated so much more than his perception of himself. He's changed a bit along the way, of course (to the point that he now sees the young stand-up comic on stage in “Raw” as a completely different person), but the highs didn't break him, and the lows didn't either. As “Trading Places” director John Landis puts it in one of this film's uncommonly insightful talking head interviews: “Eddie has solid middle-class values, and he's too vain to destroy himself.”  

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Murphy agrees with that assessment. “My biggest blessing is that I love myself, and that I knew what I wanted to do really, really early,” he says while leaning back into one of the ~412 different couches that line the sprawling Los Angeles mansion he shares with his (briefly glimpsed) wife Paige Butcher, and “Being Eddie” backs him up on both points. Determined to become the next Richard Pryor by the time he was 10 years old (“I wanted to be funny like Richard and cool like Elvis”), Murphy was so locked into his mission from such a young age that he became one of the '80s biggest stars without snorting even a single line of coke — in stark contrast to his hero, who was forced to drop out of “Trading Places” after he set himself on fire amid a rum-soaked freebasing session. 

He doesn't drink. He had his first joint at 30. He is never the life of the party, despite allegedly liking to party all the time. All of the arcade cabinets in his game room work perfectly, unlike Jamie Foxx's spray-happy bathroom sink, which he leaves broken in order to allow some funniness to seep into his otherwise enchanted life. Murphy's favorite thing to do is to binge watch “Ridiculousness” at home (he compares the MTV franchise to the films of Alejandro Jodorowsky), and when the doc inevitably reaches the part about how the disaster reception to “Norbit” cost him the Oscar for “Dreamgirls,” he insists that he was only mad because the Academy made him leave the house for nothing. Murphy describes himself as “a simple guy,” while good friend Dave Chappelle prefers to think of him as “unscathed.” 

 










Unscathed maybe, but not invulnerable. On the contrary, Murphy proudly identifies as an extremely sensitive type, insisting that sensitivity — as opposed to sheer talent — has been the biggest reason for his success as an artist. That sensitivity has cut both ways. As an upstart comedian it allowed him to be ahead of the culture; to see Hollywood's blind spots as clearly as Axel Foley could spot a shotgun at a strip club, and to recognize how a brash young Black kid could turn the entire country on its head by staring its true complexion straight in the face. As a 34-year-old icon whose “Vampire in Brooklyn” inspired David Spade to make a single joke at his expense during “Weekend Update” (“Look children, it's a falling star”), Murphy's sensitivity caused him to turn his back on “SNL” for almost 25 years. 

So eager to display its access that the documentary's opening shot pilots a drone right through the retractable roof of Murphy's estate, and even more eager not to lose it, “Being Eddie” lets its namesake set the terms for his own successes and failures. Murphy is justifiably proud of himself for belonging to “the first generation of Black overachievers,” and he never hesitates to pat himself on the back. “I can't think of another actor — a comedic actor, a dramatic actor, Black, white — who's done more different types of things,” he says. But, as might be expected of a man who actively changed his signature laugh because he felt like it was getting in the way, he always hears what he sounds like when he talks about himself. “I was even a rocket ship,” Murphy continues as part of a self-flagellating reference to the 2008 disaster “Meet Dave.” “And to all the young actors, I like to tell them ‘Don't ever play a rocket ship.'”

 










Murphy acknowledges that he was churning out a lot of shit in the “Meet Dave” era, but this documentary, which happens to be produced by the company responsible for last year's “Beverly Hills Cop” legacy sequel, makes sure to insist that the actor is on another hot streak (“Being Eddie” also includes a quick mention of the actor's upcoming George Clinton biopic, which Bill Condon is slated to direct for Amazon MGM Studios). Still, there's a certain solipsism to how he presents himself here. 

On the one hand, Murphy rightly places himself alongside the most transformational Black entertainers of the 20th century, and points out that he's been a trailblazer for so long that he paved the way for Morgan Freeman — Morgan Freeman! — to have their own success. On the other hand, Murphy is also quick to fall back on the classic “I just want to make people laugh” routine whenever things get too heavy, which can imply a lack of introspection at odds with his self-knowledge. The documentary's funniest moment stems from Murphy downplaying the nuances of his own image, as film critic Elvis Mitchell pops up to articulate the metatextual significance of a scene from “Beverly Hills Cop,” only for Murphy to jump in and explain that he was just laughing at a stupid face one of his friends made off-camera. 

 










Still, the takeaway from that edit is less “I'm oblivious to my own signifiers” than it is “I know myself better than even the sharpest viewers ever could.” Does that make it any less frustrating that “Being Eddie” almost completely elides Murphy's wife and children, and — a sweet aside to his late brother Charlie notwithstanding — makes no mention of the more difficult episodes from his personal life? No, not at all. But the point here isn't for us to know who Eddie Murphy is, it's for us to know that he does. And so we're left with the sight of him flipping through the pages of a tabloid magazine that's all about him. “What a life I've had” he laughs. 

“Being Eddie” is now streaming on Netflix.

Video game movies are bigger than ever, between recent hits like “Five Nights at Freddy's” and “A Minecraft Movie” that defied box office expectations to gross massive numbers worldwide. And next year promises to have another video game to movie hit: On a Nintendo Direct on Wednesday, November 12, Nintendo released the first trailer for “The Super Mario Galaxy Movie,” the second animated film adaptation of their flagship “Mario” game series. 

A sequel to 2023's “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” which was produced by Nintendo in partnership with Illumination, the film is based on 2007's “Super Mario Galaxy,” a 3D platformer released for the Nintendo Wii console system. The game follows the plumber Mario as he — like most entries in the series — races on an adventure to save Princess Peach from the villainous Bowser. The twist for “Super Mario Galaxy” is that the game departs from the Mushroom Kingdom for an interstellar adventure, as Mario teams up with the star-shaped Luma aliens and their caretaker Rosalina to find and defeat Bowser. The entry was a massive success, selling 12.80 million units worldwide by 2020, and received significant critical acclaim, often being listed by critics as one of the greatest video games in history.

“The Super Mario Galaxy Movie” will loosely adapt the original game, with both the Lumas and Rosalia being featured. In addition, the main voice cast of the original “Super Mario Bros. Movie” will return, led by Chris Pratt as Mario, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Charlie Day as Mario's brother Luigi, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, and Kevin Michael Richardson as Bowser's right-hand man Kamek. Seth Rogen and Fred Armisen, who played Donkey Kong and Cranky Kong, were also featured in the original movie but have not been announced to return. The film is directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, who return after helming the first movie. 

 










“The Super Mario Bros. Movie” originally released in April 2023. Critical reception to the movie was mixed (IndieWire gave it a B) but the film proved tremendously successful financially, grossing $1.3 billion worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of the year behind “Barbie.” Other upcoming video game films include “Five Nights at Freddy's 2” in December and “Mortal Kombat II” in May. 

“The Super Mario Galaxy Movie” releases in theaters on April 3, 2026, almost exactly three years after the original film. Watch the full trailer below.

Rounding out a strong comeback too many queer cinephiles in L.A. thought might never come, Outfest NEXT just survived its 2025 edition. Although, judging by the sound of it, a speaker inside Glendale's LOOK Dine-In Cinema Auditorium 3 did not. 

On Sunday night at a screening of Avalon Fast's “Camp,” static erupted when the audio levels on Fast's self-proclaimed “girl horror” movie got too high. “If any film was going to blow the system, it would be ‘Camp,'” the Canadian filmmaker quipped on Instagram to IndieWire, quoting a sentiment Fast heard and liked coming from the programming team. 

 










Asked for just a few nice lines about the director for IndieWire, OutFest Next's top trio of tastemakers — Sheryl Santacruz, Daniel Crooke, and Gabi Grossman, all familiar festival circuit faces with real warmth behind them — sent an effervescent text wall of sincere and complex praise via email.

“With her second feature, Avalon is showing herself to be a vital member of the genre she calls GIRL HORROR, helping to redefine the aesthetic of a new generation of transgressive, DIY, queer cinema,” the group wrote in an email. “‘Camp' is a film that, like the best works of art, feels like a divining rod to something abstract and true that you can't quite put your finger on but makes you walk through the world a little differently. It's a film about grief, the way those experiences can distort our senses of ourselves, and the extremely different ways people react to those.”

 










The word “grief” overstates the loss of a movie theater speaker by a fair bit, but the belief that human beings can, do, and perhaps should experience the world we all live in differently was clearly felt during that final programming block of Outfest Next 2025. 

A handful of festival attendees left when the audio issues persisted, but many more stayed. Some soldiered on for sheer love of Fast's story. Others got tripped up by the nature of the presentation, reframing the technical difficulty as a happy accident unprompted.

“Many thought that the speaker issue was actually a conceit of the film,” interim executive director Christopher Racster told IndieWire in a post-fest interview. “Especially because it's part of our Platinum Program, which is for more experimental films. People really wanted to see the movie, yes, but there was also this idea of like, ‘Well, maybe that's just a directorial choice!,' which was lovely — just to be able to keep going and get through that and then have the flexibility to make sure that we are honoring the filmmaker and giving them another chance to show their film for anyone who didn't have the experience they hoped for and wanted to come back.”

 










“Camp” was shown again as a matinee the next day, free of charge. “This is a film that feels deeply mystical — not in a specific religious sense — but in the sense that this film mines the mire of these characters' unmistakably queer senses of exile, pain, and alienation to find something sublime,” the programmers explained. “We think it's fitting that, of any film that would overwhelm the [sound] system that was meant to contain it, it was ‘Camp.'”

Fast's film was one of only 20 “fun, emotional, and sometimes campy” features and shorts programs picked by Outfest NEXT because they “challenge convention and expand the boundaries of LGBTQ+ representation.” That's a sharp decrease from the dozens of movies the festival used to screen back when it was an established annual event. Before Outfest picked up the “NEXT,” it ran for 11 days and took place at nine different venues, attracting as many as 70,000 guests from across the city of Los Angeles. 

In 2025, the shorter screening series had just two locations — LOOK Dine-In in Glendale and the LGBT Center's Renberg Theater. It's a stark contrast that looks like a sad story to anyone missing the context.

“Being back in a theater surrounded by members of the Outfest community felt like a homecoming, screening after screening,” the programmers wrote to IndieWire. “It also felt like an announcement: that despite a brief lull in access, visionary queer and trans cinema will always have the power to transform, engage, and empower here in the city of Los Angeles.”

 










If you're just meeting Outfest NEXT (and the beloved indie film event it used to be) for the first time this year, then you've got some real reading to do before you can say you're fully versed in the SoCal movie scene. But ask Racster to quickly sum up that 43-year history for you and the interim executive director was clear-eyed with a response he said he's been putting his heart behind for months.

“We had several goals in coming back this year,” Racster told IndieWire. “First, we wanted to take the time to make sure that our foundation was secured. There was debt when I took over and our debt is paid. We even had reserves in the bank.”

After a cataclysmic economic collapse ended Outfest in 2023, the team behind it unionized amid the push to come back. They've been officially recognized and Racster told IndieWire he's ready to get out of the way as soon as establishing infrastructure starts to inhibit community. “If we are going to learn and grow and serve the community where it is now, we need a leader who is centered in that,” he said. “And you know what? I've had my time. It's time for me to step aside once we're stable and make sure somebody else has their time.”

What they do with that time isn't about what Racster wants or even what the board wants, the interim executive director. Ensuring there is an Outfest NEXT in 2026, 2027, and beyond comes down to “talking to all the different communities that make up the LGBTQ community and asking, ‘What do you need from an organization that is hoping to serve you? What do we need to do as both a community mooring point and as [an organization that wants to] develop and promote and platform your stories?'”

 










Noting the entire Outfest NEXT team has a well-earned nap in their future, Racster said an important step had been taken by ensuring the fest returned in 2025. Still, he emphasized that the nonprofit organization needed to focus on feedback during the rebuild. Racster concluded, “Our number one job is to listen and reflect. This gave us that opportunity.” 

Even if it did take out that speaker.

Outfest NEXT returned to Los Angeles from November 6 – 9, 2025.

November 12, 2025

The features list for Danny Brown's new album Stardust hit like a crisis for anyone left whose image of Brown is fixed on drug-addled despair and dusty beats, listeners who can't fathom him going from working with Kendrick Lamar and Earl Sweatshirt to new-generation electronic wizards like femtantyl and Frost Children. But what connects Brown's work over the years is less a specific sound palette or take on prestige rap than the throbbing, raw emotion—the way he shot his voice up to paranoid delirium on “White Lines” and turned the no wave-inspired clown fiesta of ""Ain't It Funny"" into a desperate meltdown. Over a decade ago, Brown was getting giddy over Rustie's ebullient EDM-rap festival chaos and linking up with Charli xcx. He's always picked his next moves like he's yanking from a magic hat.

Stardust is Brown's first album fully sober, and it's the product of spelunking down the hyperpop rabid hole. This exploration began during the pandemic, when Dorian Electra showed him the Subculture party series, which is normally in LA but was now being held over live stream. After he left rehab, listening to underscores' imaginary-town odyssey, 2023's Wallsocket, reignited his passion for music. He slowly befriended the wider network of young producer-performers, some of whom began in the digicore scene but have tried to ditch the genre label, refusing to be static, a nomadic fever they shared with Brown. He featured on their songs and took inspo from Jane Remover's maniacal microgenre dariacore for his 2023 mixtape with JPEGMAFIA, Scaring the Hoes. Stardust marks Brown's full transformation into dance diva, his own 2020s version of Pop 2 that folds all his current obsessions into a freak-flag-flying ode to life and love. It's a fun and unwieldy spectacle—at times shaky but always full of heart.

This is a comeback story: a former “junkie, alcoholic” who lost control, now recovered and reborn, embracing the bliss and identity-making potential of music like never before. It's a classic hip-hop underdog narrative, and this is very much a rap album, just adorned with a Splice pack's worth of pixie-lated dust. Rave music is often associated with druggy abandon, but for Brown it seems more about the heady rush of joy conjured by whizzing tempos and neon synths. In “Book of Daniel,” the first of two Quadeca collabs, he puts himself on rap's Rushmore (alongside Kendrick and Earl) and shits on clickbait rappers, all while describing how he survived the days of “drinking till [I] passed out” and urging you to be your truest self. “Fuck punching in, I'mma write til my wrist breaks,” he declares. “Don't have a care in this world/About what anybody thinks.. When the fat lady sings/Just know you lived your dreams.”

It's obvious that rap's perennial eccentric would find kinship with the new vanguard of outsiders, corroding pop with Skrillex frag-bombs and all-out howls. These pals crowd around Brown at every crazed corner: Digicore darling 8485 throws a heavenly halo over the trance-rap cut “Flowers”; Texas oddball JOHNNASCUS yells ferociously over the apocalyptic “1999.” Brown gets unexpectedly poignant on “What You See,” which starts like a Vanisher bonus cut before he confesses how he used to be a power-abusing horndog. “I was at your daughters'/Doing anything that I can/Just to try to get they bra off/I'm sorry Ms. Jackson,” he raps as Quadeca cries like a wounded sprite, or maybe Brown's pained conscience.

While technically a concept album—Frost Childen's Angel Prost scatters poetry narration throughout, and Brown plays a character seemingly modeled on himself named… Dusty Star—Stardust sounds better as a choose-your-own-rave texture-taster. He strikes a neat balance between hooky and whacked-out weird on highlight “Baby,” which came from Brown linking up with underscores and playing her Dizzee Rascal's “I Luv U”; the grime GOAT is one of his big influences. You almost wish the oozy minimalism of the bubblegum bass sections between every verse never coheres into a full-on beat with unnecessary clutter. The freak-streak crosses over into “Whatever the Case,” which sounds like producer Holly rewired a “goofy ahh” TikTok beat for a ballistic WarioWare minigame. Brown's zigzagging pogo flow works best in this mad-lab mode where it's not just rap plus hyperpop—that's the case on the title track, whose grating helium-squirrel synths siren feels custom-made to filter sensitive listeners—or Danny Brown plus the secret sauce of his chosen collaborator. It has the broken wonkiness of an “OPM BABI,” something any sane person would be scared to rap over.

It's tempting to call Stardust cutting-edge because Brown hasn't released an album like this, but a lot of it isn't. A few of Brown's previous songs with Stardust collaborators are crazier than their counterparts here: ”Psychoboost,” “M3 N M1N3,” and “Shake It Like A” come to mind. Maybe it's a byproduct of this album's upbeat, victorious tone, but most songs are entry-level genre experiments as opposed to Brown fully defacing and deterritorializing the electronic styles. The whooping house of “Lift You Up” and diet Don Toliver drift of “RIGHT FROM WRONG” don't leave much of an impression. Some instrumentals seem forcibly molded into a rappable form, which Brown then steamrolls with positivity mantras instead of switching up his vocal tactics to match the unhinged sound.

Critics joke about how turbo EDM and hyperpop can be impenetrable to anyone over 25, how becoming “unc” turns Auto-Tuned moans into repellent noise. But taste is less about generational preferences than about being open to the tantalizingly unfamiliar. Stardust works best as a kind of grassroots community statement, an elder statesman—a role he's always played—teaming with a bunch of underground talents because he admired their swag. His story anchors the constantly mutating computer bleeps and relay race of features. “Back when I was in the thick of it, used to dream of days like this/Didn't know I could make it here… Man this rap shit saved my life,” he sighs on the closer “All4U,” which samples Jane Remover's “Twice Removed” but relegates their presence to an ecstatic background haze; the spotlight lies on Brown as he mumbles in disbelief, stupified by his luck. It's a love letter to rap and the people who made him excited about creating again. It's saccharine, maybe a little pat, but the emotion in his voice makes it hard not to feel fuzzy.

For the first time, Adele has been cast in a feature film. According to reports from Deadline and Variety, the British singer will star alongside in Nicholas Hoult, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Colin Firth, and others in director Tom Ford's Cry to Heaven. The movie is mooted to come out in late autumn 2026.

Cry to Heaven is Ford's adaptation of American author Anne Rice's 1982 novel of the same name. The story is set in 18th-century Italy and follows a Venetian noble and a castrated Calabrian singer who are both trying to succeed in opera. In a contemporaneous review of the novel, for The New York Times, Alice Hoffman noted the importance of music in Cry to Heaven, describing it as “bold and erotic, laced with luxury, sexual tension, music.” She continued, “Music is everywhere: in the voices of the gondoliers, the hymns of the children, the glorious chords of the opera house. Even the bees sing.”

According to the reports, Ford's film is currently in pre-production in London and Rome, and principal photography is set to begin in mid-January. Along with directorial duties, Ford is also producing and writing Cry to Heaven. It will be his third feature film, following 2009's A Single Man and 2016's Nocturnal Animals.

Adele supported her latest studio album, 2021's 30, with a 100-concert residency in Las Vegas and a 10-show residency in Munich. She has been on a self-described “break” since the end of the Las Vegas residency in November 2024.

Mandy, Indiana have announced a new album, Urgh. The Mancunian-Parisian four-piece will release the I've Seen a Way follow-up on February 6, 2026, via their new label home of Sacred Bones. With the announcement comes a new single, “Magazine”; listen to that below.

Vocalist Valentine Caulfield shared a statement about the single that includes description of sexual violence. “‘Magazine' is the expression of the frustration and deep-seated violence I felt while attempting to recover from being raped,” she wrote. “Just like most victims of sexual assault, I will never get justice, and just like most perpetrators, my attacker will never be punished. My therapist encouraged me to channel my anger into something productive, so here it is: my primal, screaming call for retribution. It is the only way I will ever get to say to my rapist: you hurt me, so I'm going to hurt you.”

The album tracklist, also below, features billy woods on a track called “Sicko!” The record is produced by guitarist Scott Fair, with Gilla Band's Daniel Fox on co-production and mixing duties. Scroll down to see the band's forthcoming European tour dates.

Cleto Escobedo III, the leader of the Jimmy Kimmel Live! house band, has died. The saxophonist, who led the late-night TV show's group, Cleto and the Cletones, from its inception in 2003, was host Jimmy Kimmel's childhood friend since elementary school in Las Vegas. A cause of death has not been announced. Escobedo was 59 years old.

“Early this morning, we lost a great friend, father, son, musician and man, my longtime bandleader Cleto Escobedo III,” Kimmel wrote yesterday on Instagram. “To say that we are heartbroken is an understatement. Cleto and I have been inseparable since I was nine years old. The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true. Cherish your friends and please keep Cleto's wife, children and parents in your prayers.”

When ABC approached Kimmel to offer him the late-night show, the host suggested Escobedo as the musical director of its house band. Kimmel ultimately convinced the station to give him a chance by bringing ABC executives to see Escobedo's ensemble perform live. Not only were they captured by the saxophonist's live presence, but the station's executives were also charmed by Kimmel's close friendship with Escobedo and the fact that Escobedo's father also played in the band.

Born Cleto Valentine Escobedo III, on August 23, 1966, in Las Vegas, Nevada, he learned to play saxophone as an 11-year-old under the tutelage of his father, who was a longtime tenor saxophonist who played live and regularly spun music around the house. “I distinctly remember my dad was playing in Hawaii,” Escobedo said in a 2024 podcast interview. “I was five years old and watching his band and him play, and I used to get teared up watching my dad play. I was so excited by the music of it all.”

Around that age, Escobedo met Kimmel for the first time, and the two immediately hit it off due to a similar taste in comedy. They spent their days playing baseball in neighborhood streets, sleeping over at each others house, staying up late to watch the Late Show With David Letterman, and going fishing together with Escobedo's father. Looking back, both men considered their friendship to be the type of close, jovial, and effortless bond between brothers.

After studying at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Escobedo started performing along the city's famed Strip in the popular cover band Santa Fe. Following an audition to join Paula Abdul's touring band, he got the first big break of his own, joining the pop star on a world tour that ultimately led to gigs with other artists, like Luis Miguel and Marc Anthony, as well as his own record deal on Virgin Records.

After Kimmel offered him the bandleader spot on his new show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Escobedo knew he had to invite his father to join him in the house band; strengthening that familial bond was a highlight of the job for the late musician. “For me, I was very happy to give him back the gift of music,” said Escobedo. “He gave up music for me, to be with me, to raise me. He had loved playing all those years, and I had followed in his footsteps. To bring him back to it was really fulfilling.”

Daphni has announced his first album in four years, Butterfly, and shared a pair of new songs. Listen to “Waiting So Long”—which “features” Dan Snaith's Caribou alter-ego—and the dubbier “Lucky” below. The Cherry follow-up arrives February 6, 2026, via Snaith's Jiaolong imprint.

Snaith explained the Daphni-Caribou collaboration in press materials thus:

People understandably always ask about the difference between Caribou and Daphni music—how I decide which is which. I think there have been times where the music I've made under the two aliases has been farther apart and times—e.g., right now—where they're closer together. One big thing that has always differentiated them is my voice. I've never sung on a Daphni track. When I started “Waiting So Long” initially it was an instrumental. The lyric and the melody came to me as I was working on it and I just recorded it without thinking too much about it, but when I listened back to it a few days later it was the first time that I've had the sense that a track belonged to both aliases—like Daphni had sampled a Caribou vocal or something like that. I'm not in the midst of some existential crisis; I haven't, hopefully, slipped too deep into the welcoming waters of the pool of Narcissus; I don't agonise about what track ends up under what alias—in fact the opposite. I worry about it less than ever and just go with my gut instinct. On a practical level I just felt like this was a track that both Daphni and Caribou fans might want to hear.

Of the album's ethos, Snaith added, “Daphni music is still music that I'm making primarily for the purpose of playing in my DJ sets. The majority of the tracks on this record I do play regularly in my sets. But then there are a bunch—slower, weirder—that I don't usually play… or wait… maybe the point is that I'd only play them in the right club.” One particular club, Open Ground in Wuppertal, Germany, bears a particular influence on the album, he noted.

A handful of songs from the new record have been released in the years since Cherry, among them “Sad Piano House,” “Clap Your Hands,” “Eleven,” and “Josephine.”

	Several months ago, Little Feat keyboardist, singer, and co-founder Billy Payne, along with his bandmates, heard an interesting proposition from their managers. Little Feat had just released Strike Up the Band, a well-received new album that rebooted its funky, good-time sound, and tour dates were underway. But to Payne's surprise, their team suggested it may be time to hang it up as a road band.


	“Everybody and their brother is retiring now,” says Payne. “But I'll be honest, I resisted it at first. I'll be 77 in March, and [guitarist] Fred Tackett is 80 and [bassist] Kenny [Gradney] will be 76 next year. But what's the rush on farewelling this thing?”


	Eventually, the band came around to the idea. And next year, Little Feat, the beloved group that's been blending Americana genres for over 55 years, will join the growing list of classic artists like Journey, Kiss, the Eagles, Elton John, John Baez, and Aerosmith who've completed or are in the midst of long-goodbye tours. The Last Farewell Tour, a nod to their cheeky 1975 album title The Last Record Album, will start next April and make its way around the world for at least two years (the band announced the first round of dates today). “They've hit a major high note in their sound and career,” co-manager Brian Penix, of the Nashville-based Vector, tells Rolling Stone, “and we all want to celebrate the legacy of Little Feat one more time across the globe. And in the right way, while we still can.”

	











	For Payne, several factors played into him signing on, from the schedule to age to finances. “It's not an immediate cutoff,” he says. “If it were, I would have said, ‘No, absolutely not.' But when I really thought about it, if you play a venue, you just knock it off your list and don't have to jump on a bus and go places every night, which is probably not a bad thing. And you can do residencies, if they're available, or play music with other people or do special events. It's age-related, but as a business model, I guess prices go up, since people think, ‘Oh, we need to see those guys.'”

	At this point, Little Feat have encompassed many guys. The original lineup, fronted by the roguishly charming Lowell George, blended blues, boogie, and country and emerged with now-standards like George's “Willin,'” famously covered by Linda Ronstadt. As the Seventies plowed on, their music, with Payne and guitarist Paul Barrere leading the way, tipped into jazz fusion as well. Little Feat remained, in Payne's word, “a secret surfing spot” for music heads. But they were widely respected, and 1978's Waiting for Columbus is still considered one of rock's essential live albums.


	After George died of a heart attack in 1979, the group reconvened in 1988, finally trademarked their name, and recruited a new lead singer, ex-Pure Prairie League balladeer Craig Fuller. In the decades since, Little Feat have lost other core members (Fuller departed; Barrere died in 2019) but still retain core members Payne, Gradney, and percussionist Sam Clayton and longtime guitarist Tackett, along with two recent new-blood recruits, guitarist-singer Scott Sharrard and drummer Tony Leone. “It's about the chemistry and how it sounds when people play together, and that sound is what makes this band still that band,” Payne insists. “When I played our last album for people, they said the same thing: ‘God, that sounds like Little Feat,' with smiles on their faces. I go, ‘Yeah, it does.' It's a miracle.”


	Bringing the story of Little Feat full circle will be the release of a new Little Feat recording. Written by George around 1970, “Feathers and a Smile” was an unreleased portion of “Crazy Captain Gunboat Willie Suite” from the band's debut. The new version features a vocal by Payne and a harmony from George's daughter Inara George, a singer and songwriter in her own right best known as one half of the indie pop band the Bird and the Bee. “It doesn't really morph too far from what Lowell did, although I'm playing piano instead of guitar,” Payne says. “We did that to illustrate the purity of what Lowell brought to us when we got it.”

	Inara George, who was barely of grade-school age when her father died, admits she wasn't familiar with “Feathers and a Smile” until she'd heard about Payne resurrecting it. “I haven't really ever heard my dad's version of it,” she says. “I'm not a keeper of his history, really, because I was not even five when he died.” But she jumped at the chance to record it, at last, with her father's old band. “There's a sweetness to it, an innocence, that feels like it's indicative of an earlier time,” she says. “The imagery is a little more Sixties. Part of my dad's storytelling is that he used words that were not always expected, which is something I admire.”

	











	The fact that Little Feat carried on after George's passing remains a point of contention for some hardcore fans, Payne admits. “People are not saying that directly to me, but it's out there,” he says. “And my feeling about that is that people are more than entitled to hold that opinion. People can say, ‘Oh, God, without Lowell, it's not this and that.'” He recalls attending a recent music conference in Colorado where the topic came up. “It was a tough room, a bunch of business types, promoters, and God knows who else,” he says. “As I'm ambling up to the stage for this panel, a guy in the back of the room goes, ‘Is Lowell with ya?' I grabbed the microphone, and said, ‘Yeah, he's always with us, he's part of our family, you dumb-ass.' I mean, come on. We do it without Lowell, but we're never doing it without him, and the same with Paul.”


	When George died, he was on a tour promoting a solo album, and his future with the band seemed unclear. “Paul and I did not kick him out of the band or compromise him in any way, shape, or form,” Payne says, alluding to the differences between George's rootsy style and he and Barrere's jazzier one at the time. “Unfortunately, he did that to himself. But there was this notion that we curtailed or took away his creativity. And my retort to that was, first of all, it wouldn't happen. And if it were true, why are there so few Lowell George songs on his solo album? He wasn't writing.”


	Whether Little Feat could continue without Payne, Gradney, and Clayton — mimicking classic-rock bands whose current touring lineups don't include any original members — has not yet been decided. “I think it's possible, if you take the paradigm Lowell and I set up in the beginning,” Payne muses. “We really didn't know exactly what it all meant: ‘Do we need a horn section? Do we need another guitar player? What about more vocals?' It was all kind of loose.”

	In one regard, the end of Little Feat as a touring ensemble is bittersweet for Inara George, since the band was keeping her late father's songs alive on the road. “It's so incredible that they're still playing and they're all such good musicians,” she says. “But all beautiful things come to an end, and they're doing it on their own terms, which is a great thing.”

	One of the men accused of killing Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins behind bars pleaded not guilty to the murder on Wednesday.


	Samuel Dodsworth, 43, appeared in Leeds Crown Court via video-link from HMP Wakefield prison, where Watkins, a convicted pedophile, was stabbed in the neck and killed in October. Dodsworth also denied being in possession of a makeshift knife on the day of Watkins' murder.


	Another man charged with murder for Watkins' death, 25-year-old prisoner Rico Gedel, did not enter a plea as he reportedly refused to leave his cell because he wanted to appear in court in person to face the charges, the BBC reports; Gedel did not take part in the video-link, and no plea was entered on his behalf.


	Four inmates were arrested in connection with Watkins' death, with the two other men accused of conspiracy to commit murder. Both Dodsworth and Gedel will face trial on May 5, 2026, on the murder charges, the judge said Wednesday.

	Watkins died at the age of 48 on October 11 at West Yorkshire, England's HMP Wakefield prison, where the former singer was serving a 29-year sentence after pleading guilty to 13 charges, including the attempted rape of a fan's baby and making child pornography.

	











	Watkins was jailed in December 2013 after admitting a string of horrific sex offenses — including the attempted rape of a fan's baby; a trial judge later said that the charges against Watkins “plumbed new depths of depravity.”

	Watkins was previously attacked at the jail in August 2023 by three other prisoners, an incident that left him with neck injuries that required hospital treatment. England's HMP Wakefield is considered one of the country's most notorious prisons and is dubbed the “Monster Mansion” as its residents include serial killers, murderers, and pedophiles.

	











	Prior to his arrest and conviction, Watkins and Lostprophets were a successful band that had sold over 3.4 million albums and had hits like “Last Train Home” and “Rooftops.” Their last record was 2012's Weapons, released two months before Watkins' arrest in September 2012.

	There were likely a lot of men like Robert Granier who helped build America. Rugged and stoic men, somewhat nomadic laborers who roamed from job to job, sawing trees one season and hammering railroad spikes into the ground the next. They worked in groups yet kept to themselves, watching silently as their fellow migrant workers tamed the land by day and laughed by campfire light at night. Many never settled down. Others, like Granier, married and planned futures around their families. Some of those futures came to pass. Some did not. All of these men who toiled in the early part of the 20th century lived and loved and paved the way for a nation, one callous and blister at a time. All of them had stories.


	An adaptation of Denis Johnson's award-winning 2011 novella, Train Dreams trails along with Granier as he goes about his life, experiencing joy and sorrow, bliss and tragedy. We meet him as a young child, sitting alone in a boxcar after losing his parents to an unknown accident, and we observe him as an old man, watching the moon landing on television right before his death. He does not slay dragons or giants, never leads armies into battle, and will inspire neither ballads nor paragraphs in history books that sing his praise. Yet, in the hands of director Clint Bentley (Jockey) and star Joel Edgerton, Robert Granier will seem to you like a hero of incredible magnitude, simply by virtue of having existed. And the movie that resurrects his lost world detail by detail, vignette by vignette, vista by stunning natural vista, is, simply put, the sort of modest masterpiece you associate with a different age altogether.

	











	That age would be the 1970s, unsurprisingly, when moviemakers had the ability to craft character studies that could balance the epic and the intimate — it's safe to assume that Bentley, his longtime co-writer and collaborator Greg Kwedar (Sing Sing), and cinematographer Aldolpho Veloso are fans of Terence Malick's work, notably Days of Heaven. It's not a huge leap to think that Edgerton, delivering what is genuinely a career-high performance in a career already brimming with highs, took a few pages from the playbooks of New Hollywood stalwarts like Robert Duvall and Gene Hackman. Yet this interpretation of Johnson's gently flowing narrative, guided along by a voiceover from veteran character actor Will Patton, is anything but a nostalgia piece or a pastiche of past landmarks. It's a tribute to everyday people of another era that walks its own poetic path, content in the knowledge that one unremarkable person's journey is remarkable enough to deserve such cinematic treatment.

	Events do occur. Conflicts do arise. Things do happen. Granier meets his future spouse, Gladys (Felicity Jones), one Sunday morning after church; naturally, it's she who approaches him. They court, and eventually marry. A baby daughter arrives, who this quiet and normally quite unexpressive man dotes on with a tenderness that suggests deep emotional currents beneath placid surfaces. Other loggers and and railroad laborers enter Granier's orbit — from Apostle Frank (Paul Schneider), a chatty lover of the gospel who discovers that karma has a way of catching up to people, to the philosophical demolition expert Arn Peeples (William H. Macy, giving a crazy old coot turn that would make Walter Brennan proud). Ditto a fellow nature lover (Kerry Condon) hired to survey the woods for possible fires. As a boy, Granier once witnessed a Chinese family run out of a general store for reasons his young mind can't fathom. Decades later, he'll helplessly watch as a Chinese railsplitter (Alfred Hsing) is flung off a bridge. The figure will return to him regularly, a ghostly presence embodying Granier's guilty conscience.

	A disaster looms on the horizon, and Train Dreams does not shy away from feelings of grief and pain any more than it relishes the landscapes of forestry and mountains, or respects how Granier's quiet dignity endures even as modernity encroaches around the edges of his vanishing environments. So much of this rests on the broad shoulders of Edgerton, who plays this man with a soulfulness that's detectable even when he merely appears to be going about his daily business. An Australian triple threat who co-founded the Blue Tongue collective with his brother Nash, Joel often specialized in tweaked genre exercises as a writer and a director (The Gift, The Square), and forged a career as a supporting actor blessed with clockwork reliability (Black Mass, Zero Dark Thirty, The Great Gatsby). When he was given something closer to a co-leading role — see: 2011's Warrior and 2016's Loving — you began to see that he could not only carry dramas that required brute physicality and/or nuance, but add shades to each of those colors in unexpected ways.

	So many films make you feel, in hindsight, that no one else could have played those characters except the people who were cast. Edgerton gives you that sensation within the first 30 seconds of him being onscreen here, and that initial faith is proven time and again throughout. Everything about Train Dreams, from its gorgeous renderings of the past to Bentley's sensitivity and eye for the perfect peripheral touch — you won't believe how a pair of boots nailed to a tree trunk could add so much texture to an offhand image — really revolves around its star's power to give you a whole world in a glance. There's a sequence near the very end of the movie that couldn't be simpler in its portrayal of experience a brief moment of transcendence, and couldn't move you to tears any more than it does. So much of that is in the look on Edgerton's face when, after a lifetime of working the earth, Granier is given the chance to view it from a different vantage point. Then again, this mood piece of monumental profundity and grace does the exact same thing for its viewers. Netflix will drop this extraordinary work on its service starting Nov. 21, but the movie opened in a handful of theaters as of last weekend. You owe it to yourself to see this on a big screen and with an audience if possible. It deserves a canvas as big as its heart.

	After FKA Twigs finished Eusexua, her blissed-out ode to dance floors everywhere, she realized she had more songs left in her. A feeling of nonstop inspiration led to Eusexua Afterglow, her new LP and an extension of a musical era that's won her a Mercury Prize nod, a Grammy nomination, and tons of new fans finally catching up to her inventive, otherworldly vision.


	We recently relaunched the Rolling Stone Interview as a video podcast, and on this episode, the British experimental artist and polymath known for her genre-bending sounds and gravity-defying dance moves sits down with Deputy Music Editor Julyssa Lopez and goes deeper on how the new album came together — and what it means to find healing on the dancefloor.


	“When I think about Eusexua, it's just about being able to be, and accepting yourself, and accepting other people,” she says. “We're just like these beautiful lights. I always talk about the light inside my chest. That's me. I'm not FKA Twigs, or I'm not even Tahlia. I'm a tiny light inside my chest, which is just filled with endless love and possibilities.”

	











	Twigs also opens up about how she views herself as an artist and how she's learned to channel her identity, vulnerability, and traumas to get to where she is today. She also tells us her funniest club stories, takes us behind-the-scenes of her new movie, The Carpenter's Son with Nic Cage, explains her collaboration with North West, and shares what she's most looking forward to after a breakthrough year.

Moore also revealed on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" that her own children often tell her ""they think I'm part alien.""

Scott Kowalchyk/CBS

 As a native of Roswell, N.M., Demi Moore has a lot of thoughts about extraterrestrials. All of which she was happy to share with Stephen Colbert, much to his — and our — amusement.


 During an appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert in support of her role on the series Landman, Moore told the host that she learned recently of his ""fascination with aliens,"" which she thought was perfect because her own children often tell her ""they think I'm part alien.""


 When Colbert asked why her daughters — Tallulah, 31, Rumer, 37, and Scout, 34 — think that about her, Moore replied, ""I don't know, maybe it's just because I was born in Roswell.""


 The town, of course, is most famous for the 1947 ""Roswell Incident,"" when the debris of a crashed military balloon was recovered, fueling decades of conspiracy theories of aliens, UFOs, and a rumored crash of an extraterrestrial spacecraft. Roswell has since leaned into its identity, with annual events such as the UFO Festival, the opening of the International UFO Museum, and other related tourist attractions.


 When Colbert first brought up the topic to Moore, she said, ""Something definitely happened. But when I was a kid, it was never spoken about. Never. It just was not ever ever talked about, not even in passing. It was as if it was a secret.""


 She added that when Hollywood came calling, with documentaries and the popular WB show, Roswell, now all of a sudden in town, ""there was a museum, and now there's a somewhat comprehensive museum discussing how they shut all communication down about it.""


 When Colbert pressed her on what she meant when she said something definitely happened, she demurred, ""I don't know. Well, you know, the largest landing strip in America is in Roswell, so there's a lot of testing that goes on.""


 When she didn't elaborate further, Colbert teased, ""Legally, you can't say anything or they'll take you out,"" to which she joked back, ""It's possible.""


 Moore then turned the tables on the late-night host, asking what his fascination with aliens is. ""What is not to be fascinated about?"" he replied. ""The possibility there are aliens, or a branch of the military that's been putting out these videos of unexplainable pill-shaped things that go into the water and come out and go from like 0 to 6,000 miles an hour with absolutely no g-force impact — I mean, what? I am not the one with the problem.""


Scott Kowalchyk/CBS

 Moore shared with Colbert that she is taking her own alien fascination to the big screen with her upcoming film Strange Arrivals, which is based on the true story of Betty and Barney Hill's alleged alien abduction. Colman Domingo will play Barney, and Moore will play Betty.

	New Zealand-based genre specialist sales outfit Black Mandala Films is bringing a fresh lineup of horror and thriller titles to the American Film Market (AFM).


	The lineup features four distinct genre offerings spanning paranormal horror to folk-influenced cosmic dread. Leading the slate is “Nightfall – A Paranormal Investigation,” a debut feature from young Australian filmmakers Myles McEwen and Ripley Stevens. 




	Set in 1988, the paranormal thriller follows investigators Mick Sutherland and Archie Charlesworth as they respond to a desperate call from Elizabeth Blair's isolated home, where they encounter a malevolent presence that unravels their sanity over seven days in what becomes known as Case 13. The cast includes Lorenzo Marte, Bill McEwen and Jack Rawlinson.

	“Beyond the Drumlins,” directed by Dan Bowhers, combines cosmic horror with folk mystery as archaeologists uncover an ancient secret beneath the Irish countryside, awakening something beyond comprehension. The cast features Michael Kowalski, Emma Jessop, Morgan DeTogne, Dan Titmuss and Goodfella Mike G.


	Filmmaker Gene Dolders brings “The Blade Cuts Deeper,” which fuses giallo aesthetics with contemporary slasher elements. The visually stylized thriller follows a narcissistic TV host who becomes trapped in his own nightmare of televised cruelty and revenge. The cast includes horror icon Laurence R. Harvey, known for “The Human Centipede 2,” and Peter Durr.


	Rounding out the slate is “The Last Supper,” a horror anthology exploring themes of food, flesh and desire. The multi-story feature aims to evoke the tonal blend of “Creepshow” and “Delicatessen” with its mix of grotesque imagery and dark humor. The anthology is directed by Craig D. Foster, Aleksandr Boikov, Marc Martínez Jordán, Doyeon Noh, Pick Poison, Christer Runde and Felipe Vargas. The project is produced by Michael Kraetzer, Nicolás Onetti and Carlos Goitia.

Exploring one of science's most exciting frontiers, the book ""Life in Space"" bridges astrophysics and biology to uncover the conditions that make life possible—on Earth and beyond. Designed for students and general readers alike, it introduces the emerging field of astrobiology through vivid explanations, real-world examples, and ethical reflections on humanity's role in the cosmos. From the detection of habitable planets to the search for biosignatures and intelligent life, the book offers a captivating, comprehensive view of life's place in the universe.

Co-authored by astrophysicist Dr. Amri Wandel and biologist Dr. Joseph Gale, both from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the book blends the cosmic with the cellular, tracing how astronomical and biological forces intersect to create and sustain life.

Beyond exploring the mysteries of the universe, ""Life in Space"" answers two important educational needs. The first is to provide a comprehensive undergraduate textbook for teaching astrobiology to students of all backgrounds and levels and anyone intrigued by the prospects for extraterrestrial life but may lack the tools to assess their scientific significance.

The second is to serve as a clear and engaging introduction to science itself for anyone interested in how scientific reasoning works, from curious readers to policymakers who encounter science in their daily work. Through astrobiology, which draws on disciplines ranging from physics and astronomy to biology and medicine, the book offers an accessible gateway to understanding the scientific method.

Drawing on over two decades of teaching at the Hebrew University, the authors transform the complex science of astrobiology into a clear and engaging narrative for students and curious readers alike. From the chemistry of life's origins and the detection of habitable planets to the ethical questions of space exploration, ""Life in Space"" spans the vastness of the cosmos and the intricacies of life on Earth.

Structured as an introductory undergraduate textbook, the volume offers readers a panoramic view of a field that unites astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and philosophy. Each chapter ends with concise take-home lessons and suggestions for further reading, encouraging critical thinking about both scientific discovery and humanity's place in the universe.

""Understanding astrobiology means understanding ourselves,"" the authors note. ""The same cosmic and geological processes that made life possible on Earth may one day help us discover it elsewhere.""

Published by Springer Nature (2025), the book offers an up-to-date overview of the latest space missions, planetary discoveries, and biosignature research, while reflecting on how Earth's own climate and environment continue to evolve.

A viral claim circulating online suggests that an alleged NASA leak has revealed an interstellar object, identified as 3I/ATLAS, emitting unusual pulse waves at 1,420 megahertz — the same frequency long used by the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) to scan the skies for alien life. The story, fuelled by trending TikTok videos and speculative social media posts, has reignited public fascination with the possibility of intelligent communication from beyond our solar system.

3I/ATLAS, officially known as an interstellar object that entered the solar system after the famous 'Oumuamua, has been the focus of several recent astronomical studies. It drew attention again when claims emerged online that the object was sending structured radio pulse patterns detectable in the 1,420 MHz band.

The alleged frequency corresponds to the hydrogen line — a natural radio wavelength emitted by neutral hydrogen and often described as the universal channel for potential interstellar communication.

According to viral social media discussions, the reported pulses appear in a repeating numeric sequence described as 'unlike any natural emission pattern'.

One widely shared TikTok video claims the pulses are transmitted exactly at 1,420 MHz, noting that this frequency mirrors the one SETI has historically used to listen for extraterrestrial intelligence.

The video amassed thousands of views and sparked widespread debate among astronomy enthusiasts, with many drawing parallels to earlier unexplained cosmic radio signals such as the 'Wow!' signal detected in 1977.

On the other hand, some users questioned the clip as no other news channel has reported the claim.

Despite the viral claims, no peer-reviewed research or official NASA confirmation has verified that 3I/ATLAS is emitting artificial or anomalous radio waves. The most recent scientific findings, reported by WIRED, show that astronomers using South Africa's MeerKAT radio telescope detected hydroxyl absorption lines at around 1,665 MHz and 1,667 MHz — both natural signatures associated with water molecules rather than communications.

The publication emphasised that there had been no confirmed radio transmission from the interstellar body beyond these absorption detections.

The SETI Institute has previously explained that while 1,420 MHz remains a critical listening frequency, it is also naturally active in the cosmos.

Numerous natural sources, such as hydrogen clouds, can emit or absorb energy in this band. As a result, scientists treat any unverified signal reports with caution until they are corroborated by multiple observatories and instruments.

The supposed 'leak' appears to have gained traction after users on X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok reposted short clips showing radio wave visualisations alongside captions referencing a 'NASA internal recording'.

None of the posts, however, provided verifiable documentation or data. Some users also shared what they called a 'pulse sequence', a repeating numerical pattern that online communities described as a potential coded message.

The 1,420 MHz band, known as the hydrogen line, has long been considered a prime candidate for interstellar communication due to its universality and minimal interference. SETI researchers have routinely monitored this frequency for decades in the hope that intelligent life elsewhere might use it as a cosmic standard for communication.

While the alleged 3I/ATLAS transmission has not been verified, its emergence on social media highlights how scientific speculation can quickly blend with public curiosity about the search for extraterrestrial life.

Experts continue to stress that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence — and for now, no evidence beyond online chatter has confirmed the existence of any artificial signals from 3I/ATLAS.

It's Jessica Pratt season again, and I'm in trouble.

With a voice as soft as buttered silk, creaking, candlelit compositions, and melodies that drift like autumn leaves dropped from a celestial firmament, as soon as the nights draw in, year after year, I find myself trudging back towards Jessica Pratt records. By this stage, they are more well-thumbed than David Attenborough's passport, and I'm concerned.

‘Is this it?' I wonder prematurely, at the age of 32, ‘Is this the last of the artistic infatuations?' The worry is two-fold: firstly, am I missing out on the magic of discovery by continually returning to records I know so well I can time kettle boils around them – in essence, am I becoming boring? 

Secondly, am I somehow unhealthily addicted – if my Pratt records were stolen and she pulled her music from Spotify, how would I cope? Is my mind in a mire of melancholy, mellow, magical Pratt?

I decided not to face these questions alone and sought the psychological help of Dr Michael Swift, the founder of Birmingham-based Swift Psychology and Head of Counselling at the Uprawr Mental Health Foundation. His illuminating insight assured me that I am not alone. There is a strange psychological quirk to what have become known as ‘comfort' albums.

With great relief, I learnt that my repetitive mornings (and evenings and showers for that matter) were scientifically explainable. “Familiarity reduces uncertainty, which calms the nervous system,” Dr Swift explains. “Knowing exactly what emotional arc we're about to experience creates a sense of control that becomes predictable. This is powerful in times of stress, almost like returning to a safe place in the mind.” 

While I was relieved that habitual listening was perfectly normal, I was less keen on the implication that I was perhaps routinely responding to unaddressed anxiety. I work from home in the non-too-consequential world of music journalism, so the revelation of latent morning stress would be news to me. But as I found out, there is truth to this for anyone who works from home.

When you work from home, ‘transitional rituals' are lost. Good old time-sapping commutes actually serve a vital human function, preparing you for task-oriented thinking on the way in, and unwinding on the way out. When you simultaneously start your day at home and at work, a strange cognitive dissonance can lead to a build-up of low-level stress.

So, in some way, that same old album, podcast, or background playlist is actually a form of self-medication. It's a way of priming your thought process. As Dr Swift explains, “Research shows that repeated exposure to the familiar can reduce cortisol, our primary stress hormone, which explains why comfort media is so often revisited.” 

Maybe that explains why the effortlessly calming ways of Pratt appeal so endlessly, too. “A calming record can feel addictive because it trains the brain to associate it with relief,” Dr Swift continues. “Each time the music lowers stress or helps us regulate emotion, the neural pathways for reward are strengthened.” 

He adds, “This is similar to how habits form as repetition binds the stimulus (music in this instance) and the soothing response together. Over time, the brain doesn't just enjoy the record, it begins to crave it as a form of self-regulation.” 

So, it seemed as though I had been overthinking the threat of staleness, and stressing over nothing – maybe I hadn't been listening to enough Pratt? After all, it's a harsh world out there, and if something brings you comfort, then you ought to let it consume you. But I still thought I'd pass this assumption by the psychologist.

“Repetition can absolutely be a healthy ritual, much like meditation or a morning coffee routine,” Dr Swift thankfully confirmed. “These rituals provide grounding and rhythm in daily life. But…” there was a stinging caveat, “psychology also tells us that when rituals are used to avoid discomfort (for instance, looping the same podcast to block intrusive thoughts), they can become a form of avoidance.” 

He concludes, “The difference lies in intention: psychological enhancement versus escape.” After a promising start, this felt like a crushing blow to my wintery Pratt cycle – how was I to know whether I was escaping or psychologically enhancing?

“Leaning too heavily on one comfort album can narrow our cultural diet, limiting opportunities for novelty, which is crucial for psychological growth,” Dr Dwift damningly declared. “On the other hand,” he thankfully continued, “our ‘go-to' pieces often reveal something essential about what we seek from culture: intimacy, stability, or self-awareness. Research suggests both novelty and familiarity are important for wellbeing, so the healthiest approach is balance – returning to comfort while remaining open to discovery.”

That, like Pratt's albums, was music to my ears. I return to her sound so frequently because I need it in my life. We all need our little culture crutches, it would seem, and as long as they're beautiful and meaningful, they're worth giving yourself up to. There's always the summer to blast Geese and board a booze cruise in Benidorm for a novel shake-up.

We owe it to ourselves to do both now more than ever – not specifically a balance of brooze cruises and acoustic folk, but maybe an endless Chatabix podcast in the bath and a spot of wild camping on the weekend – the bravely novel and the belovedly known. 

As Dr Swift concludes, “Our hectic lifestyles make comfort culture particularly appealing. When we are bombarded with news, notifications, and endless choice, the brain becomes fatigued by decision-making. Familiar media cuts through that overload by offering certainty and reducing cognitive demand. It's less about laziness and more about conserving mental energy in a world that rarely slows down.”

So, as I stare through the wisps of smoke lifting off a fresh brew to the whirling beauty of a beaten-up copy of Here In The Pitch beyond, I feel assured that it is not ruining my life, it is bringing it much-needed routine. I thrive off the New York apartment saudade that it serves up, and it seems I always will. Now I know that the obsession is psychologically safe, just so long as I never lose sight of the next Jessica Pratt in my life… and I may well have found it in Studio Electrophonique.

Margate-based studio Outsiders has conjured up a new identity for Supernatural – a natural wine brand ""not of this earth"" – with monster-like wax seals that glow in the dark and tongue-in-cheek storytelling. 

Margate-based studio Outsiders has conjured up a new identity for Supernatural – a natural wine brand ""not of this earth"" – with monster-like wax seals that glow in the dark and tongue-in-cheek storytelling. 

Supernatural wine – dreamt up by Palms Pizzeria founders Stu and Josh – has been brought to life by Margate studio Outsiders, with a brand that's full of folklore, mischief, and myth. It takes the world of natural wine (usually drenched in minimalism and soil references) and flips it upside down, culminating in a small-batch label that's fun, eerie, and beautifully crafted, with bottles that glow after dark.

""The founders came to us with the idea for a natural wine called Supernatural,"" says Outsiders co-founder Tom Lovell. ""From the start, they wanted something that stood out and had a sense of irreverence. 

""We all agreed there was already some fantastic design in this category, so how do you stand out? We wanted people to be immediately drawn to it when they saw it on the shelf and to leave them with a smile.""

From its witty tagline (""a natural wine brand not of this earth"") to the ghostly wax-sealed tops that double as glow-in-the-dark curiosities, the desire to be different is visible through every touchpoint. It's a brand built on contradiction, as it's both handmade and otherworldly.

""For us, that tagline captured the central tension in the brand idea,"" says Tom Rogers, the studio's other co-founder. ""Natural wine is often described through its connection to the soil, sun, and ancient process. What's the exact opposite of that? The line summed it up perfectly.""

Outsiders' approach to Supernatural was grounded in the question of how you make someone pick up your bottle out of the hundreds on a dimly lit shelf. Their answer was to think beyond the label.

""We quickly realised that the neck and top of the bottle are, for the most part, completely left alone,"" says Lovell. ""Everyone focuses on the base label, but why aren't people playing with the other 50% of the bottle? We were excited to see if that area could become an owned asset.""

That discovery led to Supernatural's signature feature – its wax seals. When cooled, the wax forms eerie, organic shapes, each one slightly different, like a ghost trapped in motion. ""There's a strange, ghostly energy to it,"" Rogers says. ""That quality felt like the perfect bridge between the handcrafted and the supernatural.""

Of course, no supernatural story is complete without a glow-in-the-dark moment. ""We're all from the Goosebumps generation,"" says Lovell. ""Nothing says supernatural quite like something glowing in the dark. 

""We loved the idea of these bottles living in kitchens and, when the lights are switched off, a tiny ghost floating on the shelf.""

Each bottle in the collection has its own personality, from the gothic red to the ghostly white and the Frankenstein-green Pet Nat. ""We wanted each to embody its own genre,"" says Rogers. ""A red naturally felt gothic, a white became ghostly, and the green worked perfectly for Frankenstein. 
""When you wax-seal a bottle cap, it even gives Frankenstein his hairline, which felt too good not to lean into.""

The duo's background in fashion and product design also shaped their approach, as evidenced by Supernatural's design as an object of desire. ""We were aiming for a sense of collectability, something you'd want two of: one to drink and one to keep,"" says Lovell. ""Ideally, you'd want the whole set.""

For all the humour and character, there's no shortage of craft. The studio worked with StickerWizard to create glossy relief labels, giving each bottle a tactile, high-end finish. ""At no point did we want the wit to come at the cost of communicating that it's a beautiful, low-batch natural wine,"" says Rogers. ""We worked hard on the craft and execution so that, although it's playful, it still feels aware and design-led.""

Technically, the project was as demanding as it was inventive. The team spent weeks figuring out how to get character faces onto the wax. ""For a long time we thought it wasn't going to work,"" says Lovell. ""Then Tom had a moment of inspiration and tested one of his kid's temporary tattoos on a bottle of whisky he had at home. It worked perfectly.""

Even the wax itself is an innovation. ""I think we can claim that as an Outsiders' invention,"" Rogers says. ""Mixing pigments with wax very specifically to make it glow correctly whilst still reading as white in the light.""

Supernatural's first three releases – Ghost (white), Vampire (red), and Frankenstein (green Pet Nat) – have already built a cult following, but the brand's world is still expanding. ""The concept grows stronger with each release,"" says Lovell. ""There's an alien-inspired skin-contact wine coming soon, and from there we'll keep branching into the paranormal, fantasy, and magical.""

The studio and founders are now exploring new extensions, from glow-in-the-dark candles that fit into the bottles to ghostly gift wraps. ""There are so many ways to keep building Supernatural as a brand and a product universe, not just a wine,"" says Rogers.

At its core, Supernatural speaks to a new kind of wine drinker – one as interested in design and storytelling as they are in tannins and terroir. ""They value quality, authenticity, and originality,"" says Lovell. ""For them, the experience matters just as much as the taste.""

If one thing is certain, it's that the experience of Supernatural wines feels truly out of this world.

Vatican City

Jesus did not appear to a woman in Dozulé, France, in the 1970s, and the messages she claimed to receive, including about Jesus' second coming, are misleading and twist central Christian teachings, said the prefect of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith.

""The phenomenon of the alleged apparitions said to have taken place in Dozulé is to be regarded, definitively, as not supernatural in origin,"" Cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández, the prefect, wrote in a letter confirming the judgment of Bishop Jacques Habert of Bayeux-Lisieux, the local bishop.

The letter, presented to Pope Leo XIV Nov. 3, was published on the Vatican website Nov. 12.

The apparitions were reported by Madeleine Aumont, a Catholic mother of five, who claimed to have seen Jesus and received messages from him four dozen times between 1972 and 1978.

A key part of the message was that he allegedly wanted a 24-foot-tall cross to be erected outside town and supposedly said that it would have the same power as the cross on which he was crucified in Jerusalem.

But, Cardinal Fernández wrote, ""that wood, raised upon Calvary, has become the real sign of Christ's sacrifice, which is unique and unrepeatable.""

""For this reason, every other 'sign' of the cross -- whether devout or monumental -- cannot be considered on the same plane,"" he said. ""Thus, it seems misleading, both theologically and pastorally-symbolically, to compare 'the Glorious Cross' of Dozulé to the Cross of Jerusalem.""

Some of the alleged messages, the cardinal said, say that the construction of ""the Glorious Cross"" is ""necessary for the salvation of the world"" or is ""a privileged means of obtaining universal forgiveness and peace.""

However, ""the Catholic faith teaches that the power of the cross does not need to be replicated, for it is already present in every Eucharist, in every church, in every believer who lives united to the sacrifice of Christ,"" Cardinal Fernández wrote. It is about faith not visible signs.

Jesus' cross does not need to be constructed of massive amounts of steel or concrete to be recognized, he said. ""It is raised every time a heart, moved by grace, opens itself to forgiveness; every time a soul converts; every time hope is rekindled where the situation seemed impossible; and even when, by kissing a small cross, believers entrust themselves to Christ.""

Even more troubling, he said, were alleged messages that referred ""to the remission of sins' through the contemplation of this particular cross"" that Jesus supposedly wanted built at Dozulé.

Claims that simply going to the foot of the Dozulé cross would bring the forgiveness of sins and salvation is a ""theological error,"" the cardinal said.

The Catholic Church, Cardinal Fernández wrote, ""teaches that forgiveness does not proceed from a physical location, but from Christ himself; the remission of sins is received through the sacraments -- in particular, the Sacrament of Penance -- and no material object can replace sacramental grace.""

""The Cross is indeed a sign of salvation, but a cross that we construct is not, of itself, a place of automatic forgiveness, since forgiveness comes from Christ,"" he added.

Then, he said, there is the problem of predictions of Christ's second coming and the end of the world.

In fact, one of the alleged messages urged people to build the Dozulé cross before the end of the Holy Year 1975 because the world would not make it to the next Holy Year in 2000.

""Clearly, this purported prophecy was not fulfilled,"" the cardinal wrote.

""Although the theme of the Lord's return is an integral part of the Christian faith,"" he said, ""the Church -- while recalling that Christ's return is a truth of the faith, even though no one can know or predict the precise date or its signs -- remains alert against millenarian or chronological interpretations, which risk setting the time or determining the modalities for the Final Judgment.""

""The eschatological vigilance that Jesus recommends to his disciples -- to 'watch and pray' (Mt. 26:41) -- is a stable spiritual attitude, and not a temporal prediction or a geographically localized event,"" the cardinal wrote. ""The danger of reducing Christian hope to an expectation of an imminent return with extraordinary events must be firmly avoided.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Cryptid+Sightings","The truth about the first Loch Ness monster photo","https://www.hellomagazine.com/travel/867072/the-truth-about-first-loch-ness-monster-photo/?viewas=amp","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 13:47:55 GMT","

In terms of legendary myths that have gripped us for decades, the Loch Ness Monster has earned her spot near the top of the list. What began as a blurry, black-and-white image of a serpentine-like shape rising from the still waters of the Scottish lake quickly evolved into one of the world's most fascinating mysteries. Believed to be the first-ever photograph of Nessie, the image, taken by Hugh Gray in 1933, ignited a global obsession with the sea monster that supposedly lurked beneath the surface of Loch Ness, turning Nessie into a cultural icon and sparking heated debate between believers and skeptics alike.

92 years on from the iconic photo, the story behind that single frame continues to be scrutinised and questioned – yet the snap sparked a frenzy that still draws thrill-seekers to Loch Ness in search of the elusive cryptid today. We're taking a look at how this snapshot came to be, the decades-long debate around its legitimacy, and why Nessie's legend continues to captivate imaginations nearly a century later.

The banks of Loch Ness in 1930

Though Hugh Gray's 1933 image is widely regarded as the first alleged photo of the Loch Ness Monster, sightings of the mysterious creature date back centuries, with the earliest recorded encounter being recorded 565 AD. According to Scottish folklore, a cryptid similar to a plesiosaur dwelled in the murky depths of the Scottish loch – a lake that holds the largest volume of freshwater in the British Isles, plunging to a staggering 230 metres at its deepest point.

For centuries, Nessie's story remained largely local folklore, known mainly to Highland residents, with most sightings being reported by locals. That all changed with a single photograph in 1933, which brought the creature into global consciousness and transformed it into the world's most famous cryptid.

A search party looking for Nessie in 1933

The photograph was captured by Hugh Gray, a Scottish aluminium-works employee who lived near Loch Ness and enjoyed regular walks along the Foyers River. Following his usual Sunday church service, Hugh stepped out on his routine walk and reported spotting a strange shape bobbing above the water's surface, quickly snapping several images.

The shape, described by Hugh to the Scottish Daily Record as “an object of considerable dimensions”, followed several other reported Nessie sightings that year. A visiting Londoner, George Spicer, reported a “large creature with a long, wavy, narrow neck” that crossed in front of his car, while local hotel manager Aldie Mackay told of a “whale-like fish” spotted in the loch.

“I did not see any head, for what I took to be the front parts were under the water, but there was considerable movement from what seemed to be the tail, the part furthest from me,"" Hugh told the paper. The object only appeared for a few minutes then sank out of sight.""

Hugh's original image

The image divided opinion from the start – its blurry quality left it open to much interpretation, with some arguing that it was local wildlife, floating debris, or even Hugh's own Labrador with a stick in its mouth. Supporters pointed out the long-necked, humped-back outline, similar to that of a prehistoric plesiosaur, as confirmation that the image captured the local monster; it was around this time the name “Loch Ness Monster” began to take hold.

Hugh Gray, a respected local employee, was widely believed to be honest and unlikely to fabricate the sighting, lending credibility to the picture in the eyes of many. His image also went on to spark a tourism boom, further supported by the infamous “Surgeon's Photograph” taken in 1934, and the legend quickly became intertwined with Scotland's cultural and economic identity.

The photo, seen here, is widely regarded as the definitive Loch Ness Monster picture

The most famous picture of the Loch Ness monster, which captured worldwide attention, appeared in the Daily Mail just five months after Hugh's image was published. Taken by London gynaecologist Robert Kenneth Wilson and dubbed the “Surgeon's Photograph”, it was far clearer than the original and widely accepted at the time as more credible evidence of Nessie.

Sixty years later, the photo was exposed as a hoax. Marmaduke Wetherell, who had been embarrassed by his employer, the Daily Mail, after claiming to have found Nessie's footprints (later identified as a hippo foot from an umbrella stand), sought revenge. Along with a few accomplices, he staged the photograph by attaching a monster-like neck to a toy submarine and capturing the shot. As a respected surgeon, Robert's involvement lent the image additional credibility.

Christian Spurling, a sculptor who helped construct the model, confessed to the hoax on his deathbed in 1994.

One of many Nessie-hunting voyages now available in the Highlands, 2024

Unlike the “Surgeon's Photograph”, Hugh's image has never been outright debunked, leaving it shrouded in mystery nearly a century later. It kicked off the modern era of Nessie hunting, inspiring countless visitors, amateur researchers, and thrill-seekers to scour Loch Ness in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the creature.

While we still don't know what the shape depicted in the image is – and likely never will – it helped transform local folklore into a global phenomenon, cementing Nessie's place in cultural history.

Chart-topping septet PSYCHIC FEVER continue to cement their status as steadily rising act with their latest track “SWISH DAT.” A heavy-hitting production rooted in powerful basslines and sharp lyricism, the track paints a vivid picture of strength and precision.

Layering anthemic beats and vibrant imagery with their refreshing musicality, PSYCHIC FEVER continue their momentum following their hit EP and first-ever U.S. tour with this new track which is also the original soundtrack theme for hit Japanese TV show, Masked NINJA Akakage. Energetic and charming with their ability to blend intense sonics with crisp choreography, seven-piece continue to expand their fanbase across the globe with each new release.

Three years into their musical journey, PSYCHIC FEVER – consisting of KOKORO, WEESA, TSURUGI, RYOGA, REN, JIMMY, and RYUSHIN –  continue to go from strength to strength with their bold artistry.  In conversation with Earmilk, they talk about their latest single, their sonic evolution, memorable moments and genres they'd love to experiment with.



What's the inspiration/message behind “Swish Dat”?

KOKORO: This track is themed around ‘Masked NINJA Akakage.' I aimed to capture the silence and intensity of a ninja, blending traditional Japanese elements with hip-hop sounds.

WEESA: Since it's a song tied to a drama, we created both the track and the music video to match its concept. We focused on Japanese culture, using themes like ninjas and temples.

How would you say your sound has evolved over time and where do you see it going from here? 

RYOGA: When we debuted, we explored our individuality and group direction, mainly expressing ourselves through R&B and HIP HOP. Through experiences overseas, we realized the importance of delivering music beyond genre and language, and our sound has evolved to be more open and globally conscious. Moving forward, while keeping HIP HOP and R&B in mind, we want to challenge ourselves with collaborations that transcend national and cultural boundaries. We also want to cherish our roots in Japanese culture while creating music that resonates with listeners around the world.

JIMMY: PSYCHIC FEVER has tried many genres and styles. The result of these experiments can be seen in “PSYCHIC FILE.” After producing many songs since our debut, from this year onward, we want to focus even more on HIP HOP and R&B.

As the OST for “Masked NINJA Akakage,” how do you think this particular track adds to the mood of the show? 

TSURUGIi: “SWISH DAT” is a fast-paced, tense track, which I think enhances the mood of the ninja battles depicted in Akakage.

RYUSHIN: We challenged ourselves to create a unique atmosphere by blending Japanese elements with the song. Even though it has traditional aspects, it also includes hip-hop elements, creating a daring atmosphere that fits the drama well.

If you could experiment with any genre or concepts in the future, what would they be and why?

REN: I would like to try ballads. Most of our songs are R&B, and we don't have many opportunities to perform ballads. I think ballads are an essential part of expressing various genres as PSYCHIC FEVER, so I want to challenge myself with them.

WEESA：I personally like rock, so I'd like to create a song with rock elements.

In terms of performing live, what do you enjoy most other than of course getting to connect with fans?

TSURUGI: The atmosphere of the area where we perform! I love feeling the vibe of the city as well as the local fans. I also enjoy exploring the streets, so I hope fans will show us around!

KOKORO:  I focus on how far I can push myself during the performance. Since each stage is different in terms of health and environment, it's a challenge every time, so I enjoy performing while testing myself.

What's been the most memorable moment of your music journey so far? What's on your bucket list?

REN: My first U.S. tour. Until then, we had mainly performed in Japan and Asia, but performing in the U.S. was an invaluable experience for both myself and the team. Most of the audience had never seen our performance before, but they sang and danced along with us, making it a lifelong memory.

RYUSHIN: Going to Thailand for the first time and living there for six months was very memorable. It was my first time living abroad and performing there. That experience shaped who we are today, so it's an unforgettable moment.

JIMMY: The first tours in various locations are very memorable. The solo tour in Japan was a mix of tension and great accomplishment, and the Asia and U.S. tours brought the excitement of stepping into something new. I think the strength of LDH as a whole is shown through live performances, so I want to refine our sets and lighting overseas to convey our power to the world.

Finally, if you describe PSYCHIC FEVER's artistry in 3 words what would they be and why?

RYOGA: “ENERGY,” “UNITY,” and “EVOLVE.” We want to deliver full energy on every stage. Each of the seven members has a different personality, but above all, we value the sense of unity as a team. And we are always evolving—updating our music and performance from yesterday to today, and today to tomorrow. This is our style.

KOKORO: Love, Dream, Happiness. The name of our company, “LDH,” is actually derived from these three words, which are a constant motto for us. Through our music and live entertainment, we want to share these three values with fans all around the world.

Tucker Carlson — who has peddled several conspiracy theories over the years — dug into his bag of misleading, bonkers claims on Monday to promote the fringe chemtrails conspiracy theory on his show.

The former Fox News host — alongside a clip of the episode on X — wrote that the government “has finally admitted that chemtrails are real,” highlighting points in the video that touched on “Strange Streaks in the Sky” and the U.S. military's “Role in Climate Engineering.”

Believers in the debunked theory have linked condensation trails left behind by aircraft to some form of chemical or biological agent used to control the weather and/or manipulate the public.

The episode sees Carlson interviewing Dane Wigington, who once pushed a pseudoscientific theory that California's drought between 2011 and 2017 was the government's doing.

Carlson's post was hit with a community note on X that points out there's been no U.S. government admission confirming that chemtrails are “real.”

Critics on X hit back at the former Fox News host over the episode, including one user who called the chemtrail claims “INSULTING to even basic intelligence.”

Yes, what his guest says (and what Tucker nods along to) is insane. But it's the false framing that's the biggest problem here.No, the government did not admit ""chemtrails"" as described in this video are real in any way, shape, or form. They are lying to people. https://t.co/W3nqvVIMD8

I spent a decade in aviation. I can tell you: the chemtrail accusations are INSULTING to even basic intelligence.Consider the logistics:- Thousands of modified jets = STCs, manuals, inspections, paper trails- Tens of thousands of pilots, mechanics, ramp crews, dispatchers—no… https://t.co/FA68tDmEoN

Tucker, I'm a meteorologist.Geoengineering is a real proposed idea (a very bad one at that), but it is not the same thing as alleged “chemtrails” (the ominous line-shaped clouds). Please stop confusing these two things. I testified to Congress about this in September on behalf…

Why do smart people join dangerous cults, follow bad leaders, or stay silent when they know something's wrong? In this episode, Michael Shermer talks with organizational psychologist Colin Fisher about the science of group dynamics and conformity.

From jazz bands to political mobs, Fisher explains how our evolutionary need to belong both unites and blinds us. He discusses the psychology of revenge, polarization, social media extremism, and why our brains are wired to dehumanize “the other.”

What makes a group innovative instead of dogmatic? And how close are we—really—to turning everyday politics into a cult?

Colin M. Fisher is an Associate Professor of Organizations and Innovation at University College London's School of Management. His research focuses on helping groups and teams in situations requiring creativity, improvisation, and complex decision-making. He has written about group dynamics for both popular science and management audiences, and his work has been profiled in prominent media outlets such as BBC, Forbes, NPR, and The Times. His new book is The Collective Edge: Unlocking the Secret Power of Groups.

For decades, Washington treated Damascus as untouchable. Now, for the first time since Syria gained independence in 1946, a Syrian head of state has walked through the doors of the White House. Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa's official visit to Washington marks a remarkable moment – not only for Syria-US relations, but for the broader political landscape of the Middle East. A handshake that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago now signals a subtle but significant shift in how the West perceives Damascus.

This was already the third meeting between the two leaders in less than a year. Their first encounter took place in May during a meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council, and the second occurred in September at a dinner at the UN General Assembly in New York. Against that backdrop, al-Sharaa's current visit looks like the next step in a dialogue that has become structured, pragmatic, and increasingly institutionalized.

The historical context makes the meeting even more striking. The last senior Syrian official to set foot in the White House was then-Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa in 1999, who took part in peace talks with Israel under the administration of President Bill Clinton.

Farouk – a cousin of Ahmed al-Sharaa's father – was a key figure of the ‘old guard' from the Hafez Assad era and later served as vice president under Bashar Assad until 2014, when his path diverged from that of the ruling establishment.

That lineage adds another layer of meaning to Ahmed al-Sharaa's appearance in Washington. The family name once associated with Ba'athist orthodoxy is now linked to a new generation of Syrian leadership seeking pragmatism and legitimacy in global politics.

Al-Sharaa's visit carried both diplomatic and symbolic weight. It represented a reappraisal of Syria's place in the region's balance of power. The timing was significant: Only a week before the trip, al-Sharaa was removed from the US Treasury Department's list of ‘specially designated global terrorists', where he remained for over a decade. His transformation from an Islamist dissident to a pragmatic leader capable of mediating among rival power centers – both domestic and foreign – has become a defining feature of Syria's new political reality.

During the White House meeting, US President Donald Trump alluded to his guest's past with a characteristic shrug: “Everyone has a difficult past,” he said, setting a tone of blunt pragmatism that resonated throughout the visit. Political calculus, not ideology, was the real engine behind the renewed dialogue.

Al-Sharaa himself handled the issue directly but without defensiveness. In an interview with Fox News, he noted that he was only 19 during the tragic events of September 11, 2001 – “very young,” as he put it – and that the following years were a period of personal and ideological transformation. He deliberately positioned himself as a man who outgrew radicalism and embraced statecraft. According to al-Sharaa, his discussions with the US president focused “not on the past, but on the present and future of Syria,” which Washington increasingly sees as both a geopolitical actor and a potential economic partner.

Soon after his visit, the White House took concrete steps: The US partially eased sanctions, allowing the export of most civilian goods – including American software and technology – to Syria. The move, though largely symbolic, suggested a willingness to test new terms of engagement.

In al-Sharaa's own words, these measures reflected a “new perception” of Syria. Once seen primarily as a pariah state and a source of regional instability, Syria is now being re-evaluated – at least in certain circles in Washington – as a possible partner for stabilization and post-war reconstruction. The Syrian leader underscored that the gas sector could become a key field of cooperation between Damascus and Washington. “Syria has entered a new era,” he declared, “and this will build on a new strategy with the United States.”

Yet, behind this rhetoric of optimism, the situation is far from straightforward.

Despite bold talk of sanctions relief, the reality is far more limited. Washington has only suspended a few provisions of the Caesar Act for 180 days – a temporary measure authorized by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. According to an official statement from the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), sanctions continue to apply to any cooperation involving Syria's partners in Moscow or Tehran.

Moreover, any export of dual-use goods still requires special approval from the US authorities. In practice, this means Washington continues to maintain a firm economic grip on Damascus. Talk of “restoring sovereignty” sounds at this stage more like diplomatic rhetoric than a genuine policy shift.

The partial lifting of sanctions is a political gesture – a way for the Trump administration to test al-Sharaa's pragmatism without committing to a full reset. Syria's leadership understands this perfectly well. As much as Damascus wants to restore trade and attract investment, it also recognizes that the Caesar Act remains a powerful lever for Washington to dictate the terms of engagement. This asymmetric dynamic leaves Syria in a gray zone – formally sovereign, but still economically dependent on external approval.

A second and perhaps even deeper obstacle lies in Syria's unwavering stance on Israel. While al-Sharaa's rhetoric has been noticeably moderate – he called on West Jerusalem to “exercise restraint” following Israeli airstrikes – he has categorically refused to join the Abraham Accords. For Washington, this came as a disappointment: The White House had hoped that Syria might be ready for gradual normalization with the Jewish state. But for Damascus, the matter is non-negotiable.

The Golan Heights remain, in Syrian eyes, occupied territory, and peace with Israel is impossible until the issue is resolved. This position is embedded in Syria's national identity and political culture. No government – whether that of Hafez Assad, Bashar Assad, or Ahmed al-Sharaa – can afford to renounce it without losing legitimacy at home.

The Kurdish issue remains another unresolved pillar of Syria-US relations. For years, Washington has relied on Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria as its key local ally in counter-terrorism operations. Damascus, however, views Kurdish autonomy as a direct challenge to Syria's territorial integrity. These regions, rich in oil and gas, also represent a vital economic resource that Damascus cannot easily concede.

The US, regardless of administration, has shown no intention of withdrawing from Kurdish-controlled areas. Both Democrats and Republicans see their presence there as a strategic foothold. As a result, any dialogue between Washington and Damascus will inevitably run into questions of internal sovereignty – an obstacle that no diplomatic handshake can easily resolve.

Economically, Syria stands on fragile ground. The country's reconstruction needs are enormous – with estimates reaching hundreds of billions of dollars. Ironically, much of the damage was caused by military campaigns launched or supported by the US and its allies. This makes the issue of funding reconstruction both politically and morally charged.

For the Trump administration, the idea of large-scale investment in Syria is a non-starter. With budget constraints at home and opposition in Congress, Washington's willingness to underwrite rebuilding efforts is minimal. Even among Trump's advisers, skepticism runs deep. Many believe al-Sharaa's status as ‘interim president' is too uncertain to justify long-term engagement. The prospect of a new political reshuffle in Damascus makes American investment a risky bet.

For Damascus, however, the logic is different. Economic cooperation – even limited – signals legitimacy and political rehabilitation. Al-Sharaa's government hopes that selective easing of sanctions could attract Gulf or European investors, opening pathways that remain formally consistent with US policy. Yet, without a full lifting of restrictions, Syria's economy remains confined to a narrow channel, its growth potential limited by Western approval mechanisms.

Contrary to early Western predictions, al-Sharaa has not broken ties with Russia, nor has he tilted fully toward the US. His approach has been marked by deliberate balance – a state-centric pragmatism that seeks stability rather than ideological alignment.

His first official visit after taking office was to Moscow, where he met with President Vladimir Putin and reaffirmed the continuity of strategic cooperation. Only afterward did he travel to Washington. The order of these visits was symbolic: It underscored Syria's intention to preserve its partnership with Russia while opening a new channel to the US.

Al-Sharaa has also made clear that he supports Russia's continued military presence in Tartus and Khmeimim, calling it a stabilizing factor in Syria's security architecture.

In his view, Russian bases act as deterrents against extremism and external interference – an argument that finds tacit understanding even among other regional actors, from Türkiye to the Gulf monarchies. These countries, while wary of Moscow's influence, recognize that the Russian military footprint contributes to regional balance and prevents the re-emergence of chaos.

Relations with Iran remain the most delicate dimension of al-Sharaa's foreign policy. While Syria and Iran shared close ties during the war, Damascus has lately shown caution in its dealings with Tehran. The new administration appears intent on redefining this relationship in more transactional, less ideological terms.

Analysts suggest that Moscow now serves as a quiet mediator between Damascus and Tehran, helping to smooth tensions and coordinate regional diplomacy. This triangular dynamic – with Russia balancing between Iran and Syria – is acceptable to other regional powers as well, including Türkiye and the Gulf states, all of whom seek to prevent another destabilizing escalation.

The White House, too, is aware of these undercurrents. Despite rhetoric about Syria's ‘democratization', Washington understands that pushing Damascus away from Moscow could easily backfire, reigniting the very instability the region is trying to contain.

Taken together, these developments reveal a Syrian leadership that is learning to navigate the multipolar order with growing sophistication. Ahmed al-Sharaa has positioned himself as a careful tactician – neither a Western client nor a Russian, but a regional player seeking maneuvering space between great powers. His foreign policy is built on cautious multi-vector diplomacy aimed at one overriding goal: Safeguarding Syria's sovereignty and security in a world where both are constantly under pressure.

In that sense, his visit to Washington was indeed historic. It broke long-standing taboos, softened rhetoric, and produced a few tangible outcomes. But to call it a new era in Syria–US relations would be premature. Deep structural contradictions – sanctions, Israel, the Kurds, and reconstruction – remain unresolved. Until these are addressed institutionally rather than symbolically, the partnership will stay limited and fragile.

Ahmed al-Sharaa's trip may have opened the door to dialogue – but for now, that door remains only half-open.

MUSCAT, November 12. /TASS/. Relations between Oman and Russia have shown resilience and a positive trend amid global developments, Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu said at a meeting of the Russian-Omani Strategic Dialogue.

The event is co-chaired by Shoigu and Secretary-General of Oman's National Security Council Idris al Kindi. ""The friendly ties between our countries have recently reached an important milestone, the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. Amid the global processes that transform the world, our bilateral cooperation not only demonstrates resilience but even shows an upward trajectory,"" Shoigu noted.

The Security Council secretary said he expects to discuss the prospects for strengthening Russian-Omani security cooperation. ""I have arrived in Oman with a large Russian interagency delegation. Consultations of working groups are on the agenda, during which the most pressing issues of bilateral cooperation will also be addressed,"" he added.

Shoigu congratulated his Omani counterpart on the upcoming National Day of the Sultanate of Oman. ""At the end of April, Sultan Haitham bin Tariq Al Said of Oman arrived in Russia with a historic state visit. It accelerated the development of dialogue between Moscow and Muscat across all areas. During the Russian-Omani summit we signed a great number of agreements. We are now focused on implementing them,"" the Russian official said.

Earlier, the press service of the Russian Security Council reported that Shoigu, leading an interagency delegation, has arrived in Oman, where he will discuss security cooperation and the development of strategic projects with the country's leadership.

From L-R: Mark Duggan, professor of economics at Stanford University, MIT economist Jacquelyn Pless and Canadian-born MIT astrophysicist Sara Seager.Supplied

Three prominent U.S. scholars are moving to the University of Toronto, as the school embarks on a wave of talent attraction spurred in part by upheaval in the postsecondary sector in the United States.

The new hires include a husband-and-wife team of economists, Mark Duggan from Stanford University and Jacquelyn Pless from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as Canadian-born astrophysicist Sara Seager, also currently at MIT.

At the same time, U of T is also announcing a $24-million plan to recruit top young scholars from around the world as well as funding to boost the early career trajectory of the university's own researchers.

The university plans to hire 100 postdoctoral fellows across a range of disciplines over two years, providing combined salary and research funding support of about $100,000 for each.

The U of T initiative announced Wednesday will be funded by the university and is separate from funding packages announced in last week's federal budget. The Liberal government led by Prime Minister Mark Carney has pledged $1.7-billion to attract top international researchers over the next decade or more, with $1-billion earmarked for recruitment of senior researchers.

Federal Budget 2025: Postsecondary schools cheer funds for talent, bemoan foreign student caps

Joshua Barker, a vice-provost and dean of the School of Graduate Studies, said recent geopolitical shifts have put U of T in a favourable recruiting position. Hiring a cohort of talented, young scholars allows the university to get to know them and their work over an extended period at a relatively low cost, Prof. Barker said. The expectation is that some will eventually be hired as permanent faculty.

“This gives us a span of time to work with people, see where the dust is settling globally and then position ourselves for that future,” Prof. Barker said.

Attempts by the administration of Donald Trump to slash funding to research agencies and place pressure on leading universities has countries around the world looking to lure talented scientists away from the U.S.

As Trump cuts university research, American scholars look north

The three new faculty members announced on Wednesday expressed a range of motives for coming to U of T, many of which don't relate to politics in the United States.

For Prof. Seager, Toronto is familiar territory. She grew up in the city and credits a childhood camping trip under dark Ontario skies as the start of her fascination with the universe.

A faculty member at MIT since 2007, she has built her career trying to understand conditions on planets of other solar systems beyond our own and the potential for finding life on some of them. Over the past decade, she has played a prominent role in a NASA mission to discover such planets around nearby stars.

Under the current U.S. administration, NASA and the U.S. National Science Foundation are facing steep budget cuts, but Prof. Seager said her recent work is funded primarily through private money. The decision to come to Toronto was chiefly motivated by other factors including a strong offer of support for her program from U of T and the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics.

“It's going to thrive in Toronto because it's so interdisciplinary,” said Prof. Seager, who plans to arrive in Toronto next fall.

Meet Canada's next generation of researchers

For Prof. Duggan, an economist at Stanford University who served on the White House Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama era, what attracted him to Toronto was the opportunity to teach at the same institution as his wife. He and Prof. Pless, an MIT economist, have been living at opposite ends of the continent. Although both said they are concerned with U.S. politics and the situation facing universities, they said it was not a core driver of their decision to come to Canada.

Prof. Pless will take up a post as professor of strategic management at the Rotman School of Management. 

“The way I see Toronto and Canada more broadly is that it's really a great place to study how innovation can solve major societal challenges like climate change,” she said. She and her husband will move to Toronto next summer.

Prof. Duggan will be the director of the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy. 

“I'm a huge believer in the ability of research and what's happening in universities to make a practical, positive impact in the world,” he said. “What better time for two nerdy economists to come to Canada than when the Prime Minister is an economist?”

After a Turkish military plane crashed, the country's defense minister posted a message saying: ""Our heroic comrades-in-arms were martyred.""

All 20 military personnel on board a Turkish military cargo plane that crashed in Georgia were killed, Turkey's defense minister announced on Wednesday.

The personnel were on board the C-130 Hercules plane that took off from Azerbaijan en route to Turkey, officials said.

""Our heroic comrades-in-arms were martyred on November 11, 2025, when our C-130 military cargo plane, which had taken off from Azerbaijan en route to our country, crashed near the Georgia-Azerbaijan border,"" Defense Minister Yasar Guler said in a message posted on X, together with photographs of those killed in the crash.

In a post on X, Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev sent his sympathies to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Georgia's air traffic control service said the aircraft had disappeared from radar shortly after entering its airspace.

The cause of the crash is still unknown, and an investigation is underway.

An investigation team from Turkey reached the crash site early on Wednesday and was inspecting the plane's wreckage in coordination with the Georgian authorities, the National Defense Ministry said. 

Debris from the plane was spread across multiple locations, according to a report by Turkey's private broadcaster NTV.

The C-130 Hercules is made by US manufacturer Lockheed Martin and is used by many air forces around the world to transport personnel and equipment.

Footage circulated Tuesday in Azerbaijani media purporting to show the plane spinning sideways as it fell, ending in a large cloud of black smoke on the ground. There was also footage of what news outlets alleged was burning wreckage at the crash site.

The Turkish military has asked the press not to publish images of the crash, citing security and privacy concerns for the victims.

There was no information on funeral arrangements or when the remains would be returned to Turkey.

The emails also suggest Trump spent several hours with a victim at one of Epstein's residences.

Newly released emails from Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender and accused trafficker who was once good friends with President Donald Trump, reveal that Trump was likely aware of the disgraced financier's misdeeds.

The emails from Epstein to Ghislaine Maxwell, his former girlfriend and co-conspirator in the sex trafficking scheme, as well as to author Michael Wolff, were obtained by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee after the committee subpoenaed Epstein's estate earlier this year. Trump is mentioned multiple times in the messages, which were sent over the span of the last 15 years. The correspondences were made public on Wednesday morning.

Trump has denied having knowledge of Epstein's misconduct at the time it was taking place, but the emails reveal he knew more about what transpired than he's previously claimed.

In a 2011 email to Maxwell, Epstein indicated that Trump was keeping a secret for him. “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump,” Epstein wrote.

In that same message, Epstein said that Trump had “spent hours at my house” with a person who later became known as one of Epstein's sex trafficking victims. 

A direct email exchange from 2011 between Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, just released by House Oversight Committee Democrats.

In a 2015 correspondence with Wolff, Epstein asked the author how he should handle possible press inquiries if his past association with Trump was brought up during a 2015 GOP primary election debate. 

“If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable P.R. and political currency,” Wolff responded, adding that Epstein should let Trump “hang himself” if he tries to deny having a previous friendship with him.

And in 2019, shortly before he was arrested, Epstein told Wolff that Trump was aware of his sex trafficking operation.

“Of course he knew about the girls,” Epstein said, adding that Trump had “asked Ghislaine to stop.” 

It's unclear what Trump meant by asking Maxwell to “stop” — whether he was requesting that they halt their operations altogether, or simply their recruitment of girls and women from his Mar-a-Lago resort, which is reportedly one of the reasons the two had a falling out.

Epstein reportedly died by suicide in 2019 while in custody awaiting trial.

The emails are missing important context, which could potentially be remedied by the Department of Justice (DOJ) releasing the entirety of Epstein files in their possession. Rep. Robert Garcia (D-California), the ranking member on the Oversight Committee, said that those files must be made public.

“The Department of Justice must fully release the Epstein files to the public immediately. The more Donald Trump tries to cover up the Epstein files, the more we uncover,” Garcia said, adding that the new emails “raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the President.”

The disclosure of the emails comes as the House of Representatives is set to reconvene following a lengthy government shutdown, and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) has announced he finally plans to seat Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva (D-Arizona), who won a special election in September but has not yet been allowed to assume her role. 

Johnson had blocked her from becoming a member of Congress, claiming he couldn't swear her in because the House was out of session, despite the fact that he had allowed Republicans to be sworn in earlier this year under the same circumstances. 

Grijalva represents the last vote needed in a bipartisan coalition to force a discharge petition vote in the House on releasing the Epstein files in possession of the DOJ. Political observers — and Grijalva herself — have suggested that Johnson was delaying her swearing-in to block that vote from taking place.

The firings and gutting of Teen Vogue come amid a hard right pivot by media companies under Trump.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! 

Condé Nast is being accused of engaging in “extreme” union busting and illegal conduct after the media giant fired four union leaders and suspended five others last week, shortly after they confronted management about recent mass layoffs at Teen Vogue.

Last Wednesday, a group of over a dozen editorial staff confronted the company's head of HR seeking answers about two rounds of mass layoffs earlier in the week. This includes the termination of six employees at Teen Vogue — comprising the editor-in-chief and the majority of the team — and the announcement that the left-leaning outlet would be folded into Vogue.com. 

Later that day, four of the employees present were fired, and five other employees were suspended without pay, the union says. Three of the fired members were active in the media company's union, Condé United; Alma Avalle is the vice president for NewsGuild of New York and digital producer for Bon Appetit, and The New Yorker's Jasper Lo and Condé Nast Entertainment's Ben Dewey have both held leadership positions within the union. 

The NewsGuild of New York says that the firings are a “flagrant breach” of their union contract and an “unprecedented violation of their federally protected rights as union members to participate in a collective action.” The Guild's president, Susan DeCarava, called it “one of the most extreme attempts at union busting” that the union has seen in recent years.

The union is holding a rally on Wednesday evening in New York City to call for the reinstatement of the “fired four.” Condé United has filed an unfair labor practice charge over the terminations, and is prepared to challenge the terminations.

“We all plan to fight this all the way to the end,” Avalle told Truthout. She says she's heard from NewsGuild members across numerous major publications expressing solidarity with the “fired four.”

The company claims that the employees were fired for “extreme misconduct,” and accused the workers of “harassment.” Video of the demonstration shows workers trying to question Duncan at his office about the reasoning for the layoffs. Duncan walks away from the workers, declining to answer their questions and telling them to go back to their desks. 

Avalle said that Wednesday's march to the boss was a routine union action and, in fact, was less tense than previous actions have been. New Yorker poetry editor Hannah Aizenman, executive committee vice chair for the Guild and union steward for the New Yorker Union, characterized the march as “peaceful.”

The terminations “amount to nothing less than a declaration of war against our union, and we refuse to let them stand,” Aizenman said in an email to Truthout.

The fact that the layoffs and seemingly union-related terminations come amid a right-wing pivot by media bosses feels more than coincidental and is not lost on the union. One of the fired members, Jake Lahut, is not in union leadership, but has done critical coverage of the Trump administration as a reporter for Wired. The gutting of Teen Vogue, meanwhile, seems overtly targeted at silencing a crucial left-wing publication, analysts have noted.

“I think there is a straight line you can draw between … the Jimmy Kimmel near-cancelation, the Stephen Colbert cancelation, and the near-shuttering of Teen Vogue. These things all feel like they're happening at the same time and for similar issues, you know, and are coming right off of Bari Weiss and the Free Press taking over CBS, this general right-wing shift in media,” said Avalle. “I think it would be naive to say that that's not a factor in what's going on here.”

“By firing us, the company is trying to make examples of us — in the same way that by shuttering Teen Vogue, the company is sending a message about what progressive coverage at Condé Nast leads to,” Avalle went on.

At the same time, the Teen Vogue layoffs included the publication's only transgender staff member, as well as a number of women of color. Avalle — who is trans and an advocate for trans rights — said she wouldn't say her identity is the primary reason she was fired, but likely offered a “convenient” reason for Condé Nast to terminate her. 

“It's just kind of one fewer liability in that sense, you know, one fewer PR thing to worry about in the future,” she said.

Aizenman said that Wednesday's rally is crucial to show worker solidarity in the face of an increasingly hostile political climate.

“Tonight's rally is part of a campaign to demand that our unfairly fired colleagues be reinstated and that the company rescind all illegal retaliatory discipline immediately,” Aizenman said. “In our current anti-labor, anti-journalist climate, we recognize that the stakes of this fight extend beyond our own workplace: there are implications for the entire media industry, and for workers everywhere.”

CHICAGO (AP) — The cyclists arrive at sunrise, rolling through Chicago's Latino neighborhoods and stopping at tamale carts, elote stands and candy stalls. They buy out every last item — every tamale, every corn cob, every bundle of sweets. Then they load up the food and deliver it to shelters and families in need.

Since the start of a federal immigration crackdown that has led to more than 3,200 arrests in the Chicago metropolitan area, streets and storefronts in the city's Latino neighborhoods have emptied out. Street vendors, fearing arrest, have been afraid to leave their homes to work. Local restaurants have struggled as customers stay home.

But as fear spread, so did something else — neighbors stepping up for one another and finding creative ways to show up for vendors and restaurant owners. This includes a grassroots effort to organize so-called “buy out” events meant to allow vendors who fear being detained by immigration agents to go home early. Some Chicagoans have pooled money in their neighborhoods or through local organizations while others have simply bought out taco stands while on their way to work or tamale vendors outside their local bars.

In Little Village, Rick Rosales, community organizer with Cycling x Solidarity, helps organize two of these “buy out” rides per week that typically support five street vendors each.

“The vendors are often speechless,” Rosales said. “They'll say, ‘I have a lot of tamales. You want all of them?'”

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Once, after the group bought out a tamale vendor's cart, that man found them days later to say immigration agents were spotted on his block just hours after. “You saved my life,” Rosales said the man told them.

“This is about food and joy and bike rides,” Rosales said. “But it's also so incredibly high stakes because of the fear in our communities right now.”

It's hard to say how many street vendors have been targeted by federal immigration agents, said Maria Orozco, outreach organizer for the Street Vendors Association of Chicago, adding she knows of at least 10 who have been detained.

In September, a tamale vendor was detained while selling outside a Home Depot, according to local advocates. Soon after, federal agents arrested a flower seller in the southwest neighborhood of Archer Heights. Then they came for a cotton candy vendor in the predominantly Mexican American Little Village. Immigration agents descended on the Swap-O-Rama flea market in October and detained more than a dozen people. And last week, over 100 residents in the Brighton Park neighborhood rallied to demand the release of their local tamalero.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Orozco said losing these vendors is as much a cultural loss as an economic one, calling them part of the “fabric of our city.” She said they bring life, color and flavor to the city's streets, preserving culinary traditions and building a sense of community — and they are beloved by neighbors.

Street vendors who are afraid to work or are seeing drops in sales can apply to get financial support through the Street Vendors Association of Chicago. The group launched a GoFundMe with the goal of raising $300,000 to support street vendors.

Orozco said local businesses have also hosted pop-up events where a certain percentage of proceeds go to street vendors. The organization has also helped connect vendors to people hoping to “buy them out,” Orozco said.

“It's been emotional to see,” she said. “The vendors themselves didn't realize how much Chicagoans love and support them. None of us expected this.”

As Alonso Zaragoza, executive administrator of his neighborhood advocacy group, drove through his predominantly Latino community of Belmont Cragin, he noticed restaurants were mostly empty and dark. Restaurants in majority-Latino communities have reported significant drops in sales since federal agents descended on the city in September.

So Zaragoza began organizing restaurant crawls, drawing hundreds to struggling Latino-owned eateries. His previous event began at a taco and tamales restaurant and ended with a Mexican ice cream shop. Along the way, street cart vendors hawked elote, cotton candy and balloons as a local musical group played folk and bluegrass music.

“The financial support for our businesses is needed more than ever now,” Zaragoza said. “It goes such a long way.”

Delilah Martinez, a community organizer and owner of the Vault Gallerie in Pilsen, couldn't stand the silence on her street anymore. She was used to seeing familiar faces on 18th Street — a woman selling candy with her baby strapped to her back, a paletero who smiled at her each afternoon. Then one week, they were gone.

“It broke my heart,” Martinez said. “The streets felt empty. Our people were putting their freedom at risk just to work.”

She began raising money online and started “Operation Buyout,” approaching vendors one by one to purchase everything they had. The first woman was shocked when Martinez handed her $500.

“I just wanted her to have a day of rest, a day without fear,” Martinez said.

Among those Martinez helped recently was a baker from Mexico City who arrived in Chicago 24 years ago.

Each night, he works late, hands dusted with flour, kneading dough until they're sore and aching. For those few quiet hours, after his four children are asleep, the world feels simpler.

“There is a magic when I'm baking,” he said in Spanish. “I feel free. When I'm angry, I feel like the bread will absorb it. So I try to be happy and at peace, even when I know the reality is different.”

By 3 a.m., he's up again for his grocery store shift, juggling work and school drop-offs. For years, he's sold birthday cakes and pan dulce “by word of mouth” from his small kitchen, dreaming of one day opening his own shop.

But the baker has also heard the stories: street vendors arrested on residential streets and federal agents circling his historically Mexican American neighborhood of Pilsen. Two of his friends have been detained. When he hears sirens and helicopters, he feels “sick with fear.”

“I'm afraid for my youngest daughter,” he said. “It would be horrible to leave her. … I can't see myself without my children.”

Martinez led the baker to a table and pulled off a black cloth. A silver, restaurant-grade mixer gleamed under the fluorescent light. Martinez also handed him an envelope with $1,500 gathered from neighbors hoping to help support him when he feels unsafe selling his baked goods on the street.

The man's hand flew up to cover his mouth. He kicked his legs and began to cry.

“Thank you so much,” he said, clutching a mixer attachment to his chest. “It's beautiful.”

The daughter of Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is standing behind the National Football League's (NFL) decision to tap Bad Bunny to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show, which has garnered criticism due to what critics argue is the performer's anti-American brand. 

Charlotte Jones, who runs the famed Dallas Cowboys cheerleading team, called the NFL's choice to tap Bad Bunny ""awesome"" and ""amazing."" The United States is a society ""based on immigrants that have come here and founded our country"" and ""we can celebrate that,"" Jones added during a podcast interview on ""The Katie Miller Podcast"" hosted by Katie Miller, the wife of top Trump aid Stephen Miller. Jones also argued during the podcast segment that football aims to ""avoid politics,"" despite Bad Bunny's politically polarizing brand. 

""I think it's awesome, and I think our Latina fan base is amazing. And I think when you think about the Super Bowl you want the number one performer in the world to be there. We're on a global stage – and we can't ever forget that – our game goes out to everybody around the world. And to get the premier entertainer to want to be a part of our game, I think is amazing,"" Jones said when asked for her opinion about the selection of Bad Bunny for the Super Bowl halftime show.

""We have a mixed culture. I mean our whole society is based on immigrants that have come here and founded our country, and I think we can celebrate that, and I think the show is going to be amazing,"" she continued.

However, Miller did not let Jones off easy, saying, ""You don't think that at a time when his comments were divisive as it relates to President Trump, when everyone is just seeking this political unification, that you'd want somebody who maybe didn't touch politics to be on that stage?"" 

""I don't think our game is about politics. I don't think people tune in to look at politics. We do everything we can to avoid politics,"" Jones shot back. ""I think, in that moment, that people will be watching the game, they'll be celebrating music, and nobody will be thinking about whose – what's comments on the left side, what comments on the right side. This is about bringing people together.""

But, while Jones argues that the Super Bowl is not about politics, it certainly has been for Bad Bunny.

The Puerto Rican-born artist, for example, has made politically driven touring choices. He committed ahead of his 2025-2026 tour to no stops in the United States, which the performer explained was due, at least in part, because of the country's crackdown on immigration. Bad Bunny, who performs the majority of his songs in Spanish, said he was protecting his fans from being nabbed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials while attending his shows.

The soon-to-be Super Bowl halftime performer also explained that one of the reasons for not touring in the United States was because Puerto Rico, where he is from, is still not a state. But, at the same time, he has complained about ICE enforcement operations in the U.S. jurisdiction.  

""Look, those motherf---ers are in these cars, RAV4s. They're here on [Avenida] Pontezuela,"" the performer said of U.S. immigration officials arriving in the Puerto Rican city of Carolina, according to the Los Angeles Times. He lamented that they were going around arresting illegal immigrants ""instead of leaving the people alone and working.""

Meanwhile, the performer also endorsed Kamala Harris for president before she lost to Donald Trump.

Puerto Rican musician Bad Bunny sparked a litany of split conversation upon the announcement of his Super Bowl halftime show in 2026.

After Bad Bunny was selected by the NFL to be this year's halftime show, several rumors began circulating that multiple teams, including Jones' father's Cowboys, had petitioned the NFL to pick a new halftime performer. However, no formal announcements were put out by any teams making such demands, according to fact-checkers.

The NFL has said they will not amend their choice, with the league's commissioner, Roger Goodell, stating the decision had been ""carefully thought through."" 

""I'm not sure we've ever selected an artist where we didn't have some blowback or criticism,"" Goodell said. ""It's pretty hard to do when you have literally hundreds of millions of people that are watching.""

Energy Secretary Chris Wright discusses renewable energy demands, gas prices and artificial intelligence needs on 'Special Report.'

FIRST ON FOX: An expansive liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in the Arctic took a big step forward this week while officials at the Energy and Interior Departments heralded it as key to President Donald Trump's ""American energy dominance"" agenda.

Alaska LNG, a branch of the New York City and Anchorage-based Glenfarne energy company, and energy technology giant BakerHughes announced an alliance that will bring to reality and accelerate plans for a nearly 1,000-mile, 42-inch LNG pipeline down the middle of the Last Frontier, and a corresponding terminal on the Kenai peninsula.

The 807-mile pipeline is projected to begin near Prudhoe Bay on the Arctic Ocean and run down to Nikiski – a village halfway between Anchorage and Homer.

Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum announced the agreement, with Glenfarne CEO Brendan Duval saying that BakerHughes' partnership on the project is a big deal due to the company's expertise in LNG compression technology.

Duval said the deal reflects an increased momentum toward the mega-project's future realization and praised the project's ability to attract ""global partners [in order] to achieve national and state energy objectives.""

""Alaska LNG has the potential to be one of the most significant energy infrastructure projects in our nation's history,"" Wright said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""Today's investment announcement is an important step forward for the project, prosperity in Alaska, and the energy security of America and our allies. The Trump administration remains committed to unleashing Alaska's energy potential, including by supporting Alaska LNG.""

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum added that U.S. LNG is ""not just an energy source [but] a strategic asset that powers our economy.""

Burgum, who chairs the National Energy Dominance Council, added that Glenfarne and BakerHughes working together will undoubtedly bear fruit in terms of new energy infrastructure that will create long-term affordable power for Americans that is based in America.

BakerHughes chairman Lorenzo Simonelli said in a statement that natural gas provides secure and reliable energy at an affordable rate to consumers. Simonelli also touted its lower carbon output than other fuels.

BURGUM, ZELDIN, WRIGHT: THIS IS HOW AMERICA WILL ACHIEVE ENERGY DOMINANCE

According to reports, the project will include a carbon-capture plant on Alaska's remote North Slope that will have the capacity to remove seven million tons of carbon dioxide from the project annually.

Alaska's energy potential has been repeatedly touted by Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who previously told Fox News Digital he is interested in an all-of-the-above approach devoid of politics that instead focuses on what will work and what will keep energy jobs in Alaska and the U.S. writ large versus overseas.

Dunleavy and Alaska officials battled the Biden administration over what they called intentional roadblocks against natural resources exploration in places like Ambler and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's Section 1002; commonly dubbed ANWR.

Outside the Last Frontier's ubiquitous natural gas and oil prowess, Dunleavy previously told Fox News Digital he would also be open to exploring the power-generating potential of tides in Cook Inlet – said to be the second-strongest lunar-powered ebb and flow in the world.

""That basin in Cook Inlet is the most energy-rich basin on the planet: onshore wind, offshore wind, coalfields, oil, gas, tidal, geothermal — all right there,"" he said, noting a separate wind farm on Anchorage's Fire Island is easily visible from planes taking off at Ted Stevens International Airport.

He said, however, the major issue surrounding any green project is energy-storage capability, pointing to Germany as an example of where that problem has come up.

""You have to have something; a baseline power, which should be gas.""

""What people need to know is that Alaska's got this enormous renewable potential that we're going to capitalize on – but you also have to be able to pay for the capital projects in renewables, such as hydro, solar, wind, and the storage — whether that's going to be pumped-hydro up here or some other way to store the energy — but you need to have oil and gas to help pay for that,"" Dunleavy said.

Manhattan Institute fellow Daniel Di Martino, who faces losing his Venezuelan citizenship, discusses Nicolás Maduro's plan to target opposition activists and President Donald Trump's denial that he is considering strikes within the country.

As President Donald Trump warns of ""zero tolerance"" for narco-states in America's backyard, China is tightening its grip on Venezuela — a high-risk economic and political bet that could soon collide with U.S. power.

U.S. defense officials confirmed to Reuters last month that a U.S. aircraft carrier strike group had entered the Southern Command region, which covers the Caribbean and the northern coast of South America, to monitor narcotrafficking routes linked to Venezuela's military leadership.

The Pentagon said the arrival of USS Gerald R. Ford, carrying more than 4,000 sailors and dozens of tactical aircraft, would ""bolster US capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities."" It added that the mission aims to ""degrade and dismantle transnational criminal organizations.""

Within weeks, Venezuelan officers were reportedly training for guerrilla-style defense against a possible U.S. strike — an acknowledgment, according to Reuters, of ""rising anxiety inside Caracas.""

Into this standoff, Beijing unveiled a ""zero-tariff"" trade agreement with Caracas at the Shanghai Expo 2025, announced by Deputy Minister for Foreign Trade Coromoto Godoy. Venezuelan officials said the accord covers roughly 400 tariff categories, removing duties on Chinese and Venezuelan goods.

While final implementation details remain pending verification, the goal is clear: Beijing is moving fast into a sanctioned economy that Washington has sought to isolate.

""This really looks like China is going to completely take over the Venezuelan economy,"" said Gordon Chang, an expert on China's global trade strategy. ""It's going to decimate Venezuela's local industry.""

""Venezuela basically sells petroleum to China and very little else,"" he said. ""China, of course, is a manufacturer of many, many items. Venezuelan manufacturing is not going to experience a renaissance anytime soon — it's going the opposite direction.""

Chang added that Maduro's sudden embrace of Beijing stems from fear of Trump's next move.

""Maduro probably doesn't have a choice,"" he said. ""He realizes he's got a problem in the form of Donald J. Trump. There's a U.S. aircraft carrier not far from his shores, and a lot of military assets bearing down on him. He needs a friend, and he's desperate.""

""For Maduro, the zero-tariff pact may offer temporary relief — but it only deepens dependence,"" Chang added. ""I don't see this trade deal as strengthening Venezuela. I see it strengthening China's stranglehold over Venezuela.""

From Beijing's perspective, the tariff-free pact opens a commercial and strategic doorway into the Western Hemisphere just as Washington doubles down on sanctions.

The Council on Foreign Relations estimates that China has extended around $60 billion in loans to Venezuela over the past two decades, much of it repaid through oil shipments — a figure still cited by both Chinese and Venezuelan officials in 2025.

""China has leveraged multibillion-dollar loans and the establishment of satellite positioning and surveillance facilities to secure strategic control over Venezuela's natural resources and critical infrastructure,"" said Isaias Medina III, an Edward Mason Fellow at Harvard University and a former Venezuelan diplomat to the U.N. Security Council.

Medina was referring to the El Sombrero satellite ground station in Venezuela's Guárico province — a joint China-Venezuela project that Western analysts, including a recent Associated Press report, describe as part of a wider space cooperation network giving Beijing an intelligence foothold in Latin America.

Medina said the new pact must be understood as one layer in a wider anti-Western alignment.

""Under the banner of so-called ‘21st Century Socialism,' initiated by Hugo Chávez and expanded by Nicolás Maduro, the nation has evolved into a forward operating base for regimes openly hostile to the United States and its allies,"" he said.

""Iran, Russia, China, and Cuba have entrenched themselves across Venezuelan territory, using the country as a platform for asymmetric warfare, intelligence operations, and ideological expansion throughout Latin America.""

He noted that ""Russia's military footprint includes more than $12 billion in arms sales and ongoing defense cooperation and Wagner Group presence in military exercises,"" while Cuban military advisers remain embedded inside Venezuelan security institutions.

""Iran has exploited this environment to embed terrorist proxies such as Hezbollah and Hamas, using Venezuela as both a financial hub and a logistical corridor. These activities extend to former training camps in Syria, where Venezuelan operatives and mercenaries have been indoctrinated in hybrid warfare tactics,"" he added. ""Iranian interest includes potential drone manufacturing and uranium mining.""

""The Maduro government, shielded by the absence of the rule of law or legitimate governance, has replaced statecraft with criminal enterprise,"" Medina said. ""Grand corruption is not the exception; it is the system.""

""The humanitarian toll is catastrophic,"" he added. ""Over 30% of Venezuela's population has been forcibly displaced. Starvation has been weaponized as a tool of social control, amounting to a war crime under international law. Despite the enormity of these crimes, many United Nations member states continue to recognize and engage with this illegitimate regime, thereby perpetuating its impunity. The failure to confront this crisis decisively enables a coalition of adversaries, state and non-state actors alike, to project power dangerously close to U.S. territory.""

For now, Washington's sanctions campaign still constrains Venezuela's oil lifelines. In March 2025, Reuters reported that U.S. threats to impose tariffs on nations buying Venezuelan crude caused a temporary disruption in shipments to China. Beijing dismissed the measures as ""illegal extraterritorial actions"" and vowed to continue cooperation — but has not disclosed how it will enforce the new tariff-free pact.

Chang said the underlying reality hasn't changed: China can't protect Caracas from U.S. hard power.

""It can certainly launch a propaganda blitz,"" he said, ""but it can't project military force in the region. It's really up to what President Trump does. China does not have the military strength to oppose American intervention if that's what Trump decides.""

Medina agreed that the stakes reach beyond economics. ""Just three hours from U.S. shores, this narco-terrorist regime has become the operational convergence of organized crime, drug trafficking, money laundering, and human rights atrocities,"" he said, urging a Western response combining ""diplomatic isolation, targeted sanctions, and, when necessary, defensive deployments.""

California has revoked 17,000 nondomiciled commercial driver's licenses issued illegally in the state after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy demanded it do so.

The Transportation Department and the state of California have disagreed over the Golden State's compliance with federal trucking laws for several months. Duffy continues to reprimand the state for its noncompliance, and California officials have repeatedly argued they are following all regulations.

In a Wednesday announcement, the Transportation Department said the California Department of Motor Vehicles had issued 17,000 nondomiciled CDLs in violation of federal regulations. Duffy has made cracking down on non-English speaking commercial truck drivers a cornerstone priority of his department. His efforts heightened after a fatal semitruck crash in the summer caused by a non-English proficient illegal immigrant, who had one of his licenses issued in California.

“After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed,” Duffy said in a statement. “Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked.”

Duffy reiterated his threat to pull $160 million in federal funding from the state if it does not revoke all CDLs issued in violation of federal standards.

“This is just the tip of the iceberg,” Duffy said. “My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.”

The California Department of Motor Vehicles did not respond to the Washington Examiner‘s requests for comment.

In late October, the state's DMV told the Washington Examiner that the Transportation Department previously allowed CDLs “for asylum seekers and refugees.”

In a September letter obtained by the Washington Examiner, Alicia Fowler, the general counsel for the California State Transportation Agency, argued that the state is in full compliance with federal laws.

“California's laws, regulations, standards, and orders are either identical to or have the same effect as the federal safety requirements—including the English language proficiency requirement,” Fowler wrote.

However, a Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration audit this year revealed that 25% of nondomiciled CDLs were issued out of compliance with federal regulations. The audit found “systemic non-compliance” in California, Colorado, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, and Washington.

A spokesperson for the Transportation Department said it “urges all states to revoke illegally issued CDLs,” and that California was the first state found to be out of compliance.

California is also one of the top CDL-issuing states in the nation, according to the department.

DOT, CALIFORNIA DISAGREE ON STATE'S COMPLIANCE WITH ENGLISH REQUIREMENTS FOR TRUCKERS. HERE'S WHAT TO KNOW

“Sounds like the federal Secretary of Transportation needs a lesson on his own road rules,” Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D-CA) press office wrote in an X post. “The facts are plain and simple — California commercial driver's license holders had a fatal crash rate nearly 40% LOWER than the national average.”

The Transportation Department said it has notified the 17,000 nondomiciled CDL holders that their licenses are out of compliance with federal requirements. These licenses will expire in 60 days, according to the department.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

At first glance, Kazakhstan's decision to join the Abraham Accords last week holds little relevance. Israel and Kazakhstan have held diplomatic relations for over thirty years, prompting critics to view the latter's entry into the accords as nothing more than a self-aggrandizing act by President Donald Trump. But there is more to this decision than meets the eye. 

The Abraham Accords are a strategic partnership between Israel and Muslim-majority nations with the aim of expanding regional cooperation. In some cases, the accords have opened the door to normalizing ties with Israel, with countries like the United Arab Emirates, Sudan, and Bahrain recognizing the country for the first time. Signed in 2020, the Accords represented a watershed moment in the history of the Middle East, breaking with decades of entrenched grievances toward Israel in a region where many states still do not recognize its right to exist.

Kazakhstan, however, established relations with Israel in 1991 after gaining independence from Russia. Bringing the resource-rich nation into the agreement holds significant strategic relevance.

First, it extends Iran's strategic encirclement by adding to the growing list of pro-West, pro-Israel countries in the Middle East and Central Asia. Iran remains the United States' primary threat in the Middle East, and Washington has used the Abraham Accords as one tool to curb Tehran's influence and that of its proxies. Even though Iran and Kazakhstan hold strong trade and commercial relations — Kazakhstan has long helped Iran avoid international sanctions through oil swap deals — Astana has now sent a strong signal of its alignment with the West. In doing so, it gains strong allies, which it hopes will eventually allow it to decouple from Russia. Kazakhstan is a strategic partner for Iran. Should circumstances call for tougher actions against the Islamic Regime, Washington now holds significant leverage over Astana. 

Second, this action could prompt other countries in the region, like Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan, to follow suit. That would mean Iran being sandwiched between pro-Western countries, leading to even greater isolation.

It's also important to note that this is happening at a moment when Iran is already at its most vulnerable. After two years of confrontation with Israel, Iran has suffered heavy military and nuclear losses, and the devastation of Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels and Hamas. Astana's entry to the Abraham Accords is thus unnerving the regime. An Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson harshly criticized the action. 

TRUMP TICKING OFF CAMPAIGN PROMISES, BUT PESKY ISSUE OF INFLATION STILL ELUDES HIM

Kazakhstan is joining the Abraham Accords at a time of growing international criticism towards Israel in response to its conduct in the war in Gaza. But this action signals that Israel is far from isolated on the world stage, even as the number of countries recognizing Palestine continues to grow.

But most of all, alliances derive power from expansion, and Astana's step marks a weakening of Iranian posturing in the region.

Do these leggings make millennials look old? 

There have always been ways to spot someone who is old: white hair, a gray beard, bifocals, references to smallpox. But now, to the chagrin of millennials — the newest batch of elderly people — there's one that hits too close to home: leggings and tight athletic wear.

Once touchstones for wealth, fitness, and sexiness, formfitting athleisure has become a uniform for the geriatric — allegedly.

Determining what is and what isn't old people's garb is Gen Z, the youngest adults on the planet. Even though they will eventually become old themselves, for now, Gen Z determines the trends of fashion. And what they say, according to the Wall Street Journal, a newspaper that's read by more old people than young, is that now is the time for baggy-fitting sweats and tees and loose-fitting athleisure.

Think: Lululemon stuffing every adjective into its “big cozy ultra-oversized wide-leg pant.” Or Vuori's “generous” Seaside Sweatpant. Or Alo's Serenity, a pant that could easily double as a flag or a hammock.

Looking for answers and some outrage, I went to the front lines of where the battle is being fought: gyms, run clubs, group fitness classes, and the social media feeds of millennial trainers and fitness influencers. What I found was a tension between mortality and vanity, a clash where popularity meets coolness, and a strong belief that the demise of leggings might be overblown.

We may not live forever, but leggings might.



“They're trying to confuse you, Alex,” said trainer and fitness influencer Bobby McMullen. McMullen is the co-founder of an app called Adonis, which links trainers to potential clients. He is essentially a David Attenborough of athleisure.

“They're putting form above function, and it makes me sick,” he added.

McMullen, a millennial, is of a simple belief: Muscles are meant to be seen, not covered up under baggy sweats. Wearing formfitting clothes not only feels good, but they accentuate every deadlift, bench press, lunge, and snatch that our bodies have ever performed.

“If you're doing squats, I want to see an uncomfortable outline of whatever's going on down there,” McMullen said. “The bottom of your squat should be TV-MA.”

McMullen explained to me that his and other millennials' fidelity toward fitted athleisure stems, in large part, from being the first generation to experience the boom of athleisure brands. In the early 2000s, there were just a handful of options — Nike, Under Armour, Adidas, etc. — that existed for consumers. Most of those lines featured boxier, baggier cuts. The tight-fitting garments that those brands featured were mostly marketed to consumers as compression layers: basically, underwear that would strap down all your bits for the sake of athletic aerodynamics.

McMullen says it wasn't until women-forward brands like Lululemon and, now, Vuori and Alo rose to prominence that the idea of feeling sexy at the gym really sunk in, and clothes really began to reflect that concept. At the same time, millennials also grew up when the culture around health and fitness became mainstream, and gyms and fitness classes became popular.

Since everything millennials do is cringe to Gen Z, it was only a matter of time before the youths came for yoga pants and muscle tees, as well as the desire to show off the goods underneath them.

“It's almost become cringe to be vain, but you're going to have to pry it from my cold dead hands,” McMullen said.

While McMullen and his inseparability from his own vanity may (or may not) be a joke, we know that tighter gym clothes aren't just for aesthetics. A large part of the appeal of athleisure is rooted in function and performance.

“I like wearing loose clothing, but from a workout perspective, I don't know how I feel about that,” said Sharon Kim, a lifestyle content creator with a fitness background. “I'm not doing gentle yoga. I'm running miles. I'm boxing.”

Kim, who is a younger millennial, explains that the reason people (millennials) are so taken aback by Gen Z's anti-legging stance is that there are certain activities where baggy pants just don't make sense. No one wants to run miles in big sweats, nor does anyone want to cycle or take a HIIT class in loose clothes that can get in the way. As long as run clubs, cycling, and pilates exist, so will leggings.

“I don't think leggings are going to go anywhere,” she said, noting that she does sees more and more people wearing big athleisure before and after strenuous workouts.

That's mainly how Jojo Kelly, a Gen Z-millennial cusper (born in 1996) and head coach at Tonehouse, a New York City luxury strength training and fitness facility, sports it.

“I love wearing baggy clothes outside the gym,” Kelly said, adding that she also likes warming up in sweats and hoodies — a practice she learned as a dancer. Those layers can help your body loosen up and get ready for “intense exertion,” she said. But, for that exertion and proper form, sweats aren't ideal.

“You can't tell if your knees are tracking over your second toe in sweatpants,” Kelly said. “I also believe in wearing what you feel the most comfortable in. Working out is already uncomfortable enough!”

Gen Z's argument for bigger fits is that it's more comfortable and more fashionable to, essentially, not look like you're working out all the time. The popularity of aforementioned run clubs, cycling, and pilates classes made formfitting athleisure a millennial status symbol; it became a uniform. Now that the “uniform” holds less cultural cache among a younger generation, the cool move is to go big.

Alex Intriago, a coach at Solidcore in San Francisco and also a cusper (born in 1997), told me that he sees this trend out and about. Young people wear looser, baggier athleisure more casually — but not in actual workouts. She still considers wearing sweatpants in intense workouts “torture” and doesn't see herself wearing them in class. But never say never: She thought the same thing about her now-obsolete skinny jeans.

“I might flip; you never know,” Intriago said.

If there's one thing to know about this generational divide, it's that “what looks cute/fashionable/young” is an endless cycle.

Jeans and non-athleisure pants have moved on from being skinny (thankfully) — from thigh-constricting to roomier fits. And not too long before the current debate over leggings, the youth litmus test was over socks. Ankle socks are millennial indicators, while crews and quarter crews are Gen Z, apparently.

No piece of clothing — sweatshirts, skirts, jackets, baseball caps, skorts, bikinis, boxer briefs, bras, or anything in between — is safe from being considered old or, conversely, young.

The tension between millennial and Gen Z fashion might lead someone to believe that one or the other is the actual victor in this war over athleisure. But that's too simple. It's only a matter of time before Gen Alpha bucks against Gen Z's trends and deems them fit for nursing homes.

The real winners are the athleisure companies making baggy sweats and loose-fitting tops. Think about it: The market is fully saturated with leggings, muscle tees, and tight-fitting gym attire for anyone who still wants them. But there's more room to grow when it comes to the baggy stuff. Why not appeal to Gen Z while, at the same time, capitalizing on millennials' obsession with health, vanity, and youth?

If everyone's buying big pants, to the brands, it doesn't really matter why.

Former DocuSign CEO Dan Springer graduated from Harvard Business School, but he says holding an Ivy League degree won't help his employees score a promotion during their annual reviews.

""I'll tell you what matters. It matters to me that people did something great,"" Springer said in an interview with Business Insider.

Springer was the CEO of DocuSign, the electronic signature company, from 2017 to 2022. In April, he left DocuSign's board and joined Ironclad, a contract management software company, as CEO.

Springer graduated with an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1991. He then joined McKinsey and worked at the consulting firm for over six years.

He told Business Insider that while he loved his time at Harvard, he's not that interested in hearing about people's degrees.

""I'd be more interested about: 'What did you do after you got that degree? How did you apply it and how are you growing your stuff?'"" he said.

Springer said that when it comes to vetting people for promotions, he looks at three variables: an employee's skills, their ego, and how hard they work.

Those come together for him as a formula.

""Skills, having the skills that you work with, divided by your ego,"" Springer said. ""You don't want to have a big ego. You want to maintain the ego and focus on the company and our customers, and then you raise that to the power of how hard they work.""

""It's a lot of work to build a growing software company, and so people have to have that intensity to say, 'I'm going to put in the work.' Once you have the skills and values, in the end, it really comes to, 'Are you working smart and are you working hard?'"" he added.

Springer isn't the only business leader who has stressed the importance of dedication.

Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder and CEO of the hedge fund Citadel, told his summer interns in 2022 that people needed to aggressively pitch themselves for bigger roles and responsibilities.

""Don't be shy in asking for bigger problems to take on. Don't be shy about asking for a promotion. What's the worst they're going to say — that you're too ambitious?"" Griffin said.

Luis von Ahn, the cofounder and CEO of Duolingo, wrote in a LinkedIn post on September 22 that new hires who wanted to succeed at his company should be proactive at solving problems.

In his post, von Ahn said Duolingo didn't have a company blog, until an engineer took the initiative to start one. Von Ahn said that the engineer ""did way better at Duolingo"" than his colleague, who only complained about the problem instead of doing something about it.

""If something bothers you, you generally have the freedom here to fix it. We're still figuring lots of things out, and if you see a problem, you can actually do something about it here,"" von Ahn added.

A new, first-of-its-kind ""drone wall"" built to defeat Russia's most menacing weapons before they can reach cities and civilians is set to be deployed in Ukraine soon, its maker told Business Insider.

Comprised of dozens of small drones, the wall is designed to intercept an incoming munition by blowing them out of the sky, ""like a flying drone minefield,"" said the founder of Atreyd, the Western company that developed the system.

Atreyd has already shipped the system to Ukraine, and it expects it to be operational within a few weeks, explained the founder, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive developments.

The drone wall's deployment will mark the first known instance of a defense of this type becoming operational in any conflict, giving Ukraine a new layer of protection against the worsening Russian air attacks.

The system will first be used to defend cities and critical infrastructure from Russia's one-way attack drones, but it could later be deployed closer to the front lines to protect against highly destructive glide bombs, which are notoriously difficult to intercept.

Russian one-way attack drones and glide bombs have been two of the most challenging threats Ukraine is facing. These weapons are cheap, can be mass-produced, strain defenses, and can be highly destructive.

One-way attack drones — specifically, the Russian Shahed-style loitering munitions — are employed in nightly attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure. Sometimes, hundreds are included in a single bombardment, which can overwhelm air defenses.

And glide bombs are dumb bombs equipped with special kits that turn them into precision-guided munitions able to be launched from aircraft at standoff ranges beyond the reach of Ukrainian air defenses. With small radar signatures, short flight times, and non-ballistic trajectories, these weapons are difficult to intercept.

NATO, which has closely monitored Russian threats, hosted an ""Innovation Challenge"" in March for Ukrainian and Western defense companies to submit solutions for combating this kind of weaponry. Atreyd, with its drone wall concept, emerged as a finalist.

The wall is made up of a collection of first-person-view drones that take off from designated launch platforms after radars detect a potential threat. The battery-powered drones, each carrying small explosive payloads, can then be layered and spaced apart.

Once airborne, these drones form something like a curtain in the sky; it's designed to blunt air attacks by having the drone components detonate near incoming munitions to neutralize the threat and send debris plummeting to the earth below.

""We consider ourselves as a last layer of defense,"" Atreyd's founder said.

The system relies on artificial intelligence to change the structure of the wall to best respond to the detected trajectory of an incoming munition. The system is designed to be cheap; the cost of interception is just a few thousand dollars, and the drones that don't detonate can return to their launch platforms to be used in a later air defense mission.

Atreyd said that the drone wall can operate in GPS-denied environments because it is equipped with a pre-installed 3D map of its area of responsibility, a notable feature given the widespread use of electronic warfare and signal jamming on the battlefields in Ukraine.

The drones can operate at altitudes of several thousand meters and are equipped with identification technology to prevent friendly fire incidents. And while the system is able to function fully autonomously, a human can still override the system and work a kill switch.

Atreyd said one soldier can typically operate 100 drones, and they don't need any specific qualifications, either, nor do they need to be an established drone pilot. They will only be trained on how to operate the system and activate the kill switch if necessary.

The drone wall has a 100% success rating in testing, Atreyd said. But its deployment to Ukraine will be the first time that the system faces actual combat conditions.

In Ukraine, the drone wall could be used to defend its cities, energy infrastructure, and other civilian areas that are regularly under fire from devastating Russian attacks.

Atreyd's founder would not disclose exactly where, in Ukraine, the drone wall will be deployed, citing operational security concerns. However, they said it will be permanently stationed there and can expand to other locations in the country with domestically manufactured drones.

While Atreyd is developing ambitious launch platforms — such as uncrewed vehicles, flying motherships, and even a zeppelin — for foreign militaries, the drone wall that is being deployed to Ukraine will take off from ground stations for now.

The drone wall's deployment comes as Russia has modified its drones and glide bombs with jet engines, enabling the weapons to travel faster and creating new headaches for Ukrainian air defenses. Atreyd's founder is confident that the system will still be effective against them.

Atreyd already has a contract with at least one NATO member that has put in an order for a launch platform and drones. So far, the company has organized production lines in France and Ukraine, and it expects to expand these efforts soon to the US.

NATO needs to be ready to face new developments in weaponry, the founder stressed. If the alliance is caught unprepared, ""we are going to lose big.""

I write about sleep products for a living, so trust me — I know good bedding. As Black Friday sales start early ahead of Thanksgiving, I'm already tracking the best early Black Friday bedding deals to help you save on a bedroom upgrade. Shop early and you can have your guest room perfectly outfitted before holiday visitors arrive.

Currently, our favorite weighted blanket of all time, the Bearaby Cotton Napper is 15% off. It's rare to find deals on Bearaby's flagship product, so I definitely recommend checking out this sale. I'm also impressed by the 30% discount you can snag on The Company Store Air Layer Quilt when using code BFDEALS25 at checkout.  Tons of the brand's bedding staples are on sale, with some basics on sale for as much as 40% off.

I'll be updating this article with the newest deals over the next few weeks, as while the cozy savings are heating up, some heavy hitters like Brooklinen, Parachute, and Coyuchi don't start their Black Friday deals until closer to Thanksgiving. For more early deals, check out our Black Friday coverage and early Black Friday pillow and mattress deals. 

Target's Threshold sheets — the ultra-silky, comfortable budget pick in our best sheets guide — are currently 30% off, reducing the price of a queen from $55 to $38.50. If you're on the hunt for premium bedding, Cozy Earth's bamboo sheets are 20% off, for over $60 of savings on a queen set. Meanwhile, if you're after the coziest flannel sheets, Boll & Branch has introduced prints and designs with a pretty whipstitch detail that are part of the site's 20% off sitewide sale.


                          Target's affordable Threshold sheet set is soft and holds up over time so you won't have to worry about pilling or shrinking. 
                        


                      These Cozy Earth sheets are the most cooling on our list with deep pockets for mattresses up to 20 inches thick. With prices starting at $289 for a twin set, these are an investment.
                    


                      Boll & Branch's flannel sheets are durable and provide breathability for warmer months and cozy warmth for winter, making them ideal for year-round use. 
                    


                      The cool, airy, and beautiful linen sheets from Sijo will be your summer favorite, or if you regularly sleep hot, a durable yearlong standby.
                    


                      The Company Store Velvet Flannel Sheets offer a perfect balance of thickness, durability, and breathability while maintaining a velvety soft, cozy feel. This set is ideal for hot sleepers who still want the warmth and comfort of flannel during colder months. 
                    


                      The Eddie Bauer Flannel Sheets are half the price of competitors and come in the most fun prints and patterns. They're comfortable but not quite as soft as our other top picks.
                    

Silk & Snow is currently hosting an impressive early Black Friday sale with it's lowest prices of the year, including 20% off the down alternative comforter, bringing it too under $100. It was the top down alternative comforter that we tested for our best comforter guide, with a lightweight, airy feel. For quilt lovers, you can take 30% off The Company Store Air Layer Jersey Quilt with code BFDEALS25. Soft and cozy, it was our favorite cotton quilt. Though, the Company Store's best comforter deal may just be 40% off the Lacrosse Premium LoftAIRE™ Down Alternative Comoforter in light, medium, or extra warmth weights.


                          The Silk & Snow down alternative comforter is a cozy hypoallergenic option with a plush microfiber fill that available in three weights that doesn't sacrifice quality or luxury.
                        


                      The Rest Evercool comforter is one of the coolest and most versatile options we tested, offering exceptional breathability and a silky-smooth feel in various colors and sizes, ensuring a sweat-free and comfortable night's sleep.
            
                    


                      The Brooklinen All-Season Down Comforter is a soft, light, and comfortable choice that's airy and warm but remains breathable so you can use it any time of the year.
                    


                      The Garnet Hill Agnes Linen Quilt is the best quilt we've tried, with premium fabric, a classic handmade-inspired look, and comfort for all seasons. 
                    


                      The Company Store Air Layer Jersey quilt feels like your favorite well-worn cotton T-shirt, with a lightweight texture that's great for layering. 
                    


                      The super-soft  Buffy Breeze Comforter, with a shell and fill made from 100% eucalyptus, is naturally breathable and cool to the touch.
                    

If you take advantage of one Black Friday bedding deal, I recommend saving on the Coop Original Pillow. You get our favorite pillow of all time for 25% off at Coop. For other great pillow sales, check out our early Black Friday pillow deals coverage. 


                          The Coop Sleep Goods Original Pillow offers thoughtful features like adjustable fill, a washable pillow cover, and an unparalleled 100-night trial, making it the best choice for most people.
                        


                      Soft and moldable but still supportive, the Boll & Branch Down Chamber Pillow comes in three firmness levels, including a soft option for stomach sleepers.
                    


                       The Birch Organic pillow combines premium organic materials like wool and cotton for a comfortable, temperature-balanced sleep experience, featuring GREENGUARD Gold & GOTS certifications for eco-friendly assurance.
                    


                      For those seeking a pillow that's exceptionally soft, breathable, and promises a fresh start every morning, the Cozy Earth Silk pillow is definitely worth considering. 
            
                    


                      The Easy Breather Pillow's luxurious feel and durable construction, combined with its cooling properties, make it a great option for anyone seeking personalized comfort and reliable temperature regulation. 
                    


                      Whether you want to knot it up for lounging on the couch, prop your feet on it, or snuggle up for a cozy night's sleep, the Buffy Wiggle Pillow offers great full-body support. It's also sustainably made. 
                    

Besides sheets, comforters, and pillows, we're also seeing savings on bedding accessories like weighted blankets and silk pillowcases. The Bearaby Cotton Weighted Blanket — the longstanding top pick in our best weighted blanket guide — is 15% off on Bearaby's site. It's an aesthetically-pleasing knit weighted blanket that gets its heft from a heavyweight cotton yarn. Don't forget the essentials either, like the best mattress protector. Our top pick, from Coop is under $50 at Amazon. Or, scoop up the best mattress topper to give an extra level of comfort to your bed. Our top pick from Helix is 27% off with code INSIDER27.


                      The cocoon-like, knit-woven Bearaby Cotton Napper keeps you cozy yet cool as you lounge on the couch. The 40-by-64-inch 10-pound blanket is entirely machine washable and made of 100% cotton.
                    


                      This double-sided throw is surprisingly weighty, so it feels like a warm, relaxing hug. Between the weight of the blanket, the quality and softness of the material, and the ease of washability, this wins our vote as the comfiest faux fur blanket on the list. We just wish it came in more than three colors.
                    


                      Coop's mattress protector protects against small spills, big accidents, and dust mites. It's also virtually silent, with no annoying crinkling noises to disturb your slumber. 
                    


                      Slip's Silk Pillowcase is smooth on the skin and hair, preventing frizziness and irritation. We also love its range of bright colors and fun designs. 
                    


                      The Helix Premium Mattress Topper with GlacioTex has layers of foam and microcoils for unmatched comfort and support. 
            
                    


                      The Avocado Organic Waterproof Mattress Protector is made of eco-friendly materials while still providing impressive waterproofing.
                    

We typically see the lowest prices of the year on bedding during Black Friday. There are pros and cons to shopping early — for one, shopping early sales could help you refresh your guest room before Thanksgiving. At the same time, many retailers actually offer better deals on the day, during traditional Black Friday sales. While Black Friday, in general, is a great time to upgrade bedding, we recommend considering whether you should shop early or wait.

We've covered many types of bedding over the years, ranging from sheets to silk pillowcases. Some of our all time favorites are on sale for Black Friday, including the Bearaby Cotton Weighted Blanket (15% off), the Brooklinen Luxe Sateen Sheet Set (15% off), and the Coop Sleep Goods Original Pillow (25% off).

            A Chinese woman who was found with 5 billion pounds ($6.6 billion) in Bitcoin after defrauding more than 128,000 people in China in a Ponzi scheme was sentenced by a UK court on Tuesday to over 11 years in prison.
    


            Police said the investigation into Zhimin Qian, 47, led to officers recovering devices holding 61,000 Bitcoin in the largest cryptocurrency seizure in the UK.
    


            Qian, dubbed “cryptoqueen” by British media, was arrested in April 2024 after spending years evading the authorities and living an “extravagant” lifestyle in Europe, staying in luxury hotels across the continent and buying fine jewelry and watches, prosecutors said.
    


            Police said she ran a pyramid scheme that lured more than 128,000 people to invest in her business between 2014 and 2017, including many who invested their life savings and pensions. Authorities said she stored the illegally obtained funds in Bitcoin assets.
    


            When she attracted the attention of Chinese authorities, Qian fled to the UK under a fake identity. Once in London, police said she rented a “lavish” house for over 17,000 pounds ($23,000) per month, and tried but failed to buy multimillion pound properties in a bid to convert the Bitcoin.
    


            Investigators found notes Qian had written documenting her aspirations — including her “intention to become the monarch of Liberland, a self-proclaimed country consisting of a strip of land between Croatia and Serbia.”
    


The young tycoon accused of masterminding a multibillion-dollar international fraud network



            They said other notes showed Qian detailing her hopes of “meeting a duke and royalty.”
    


            Judge Sally-Ann Hales said Qian was the architect of the crimes from start to finish.
    


            “Your motive was one of pure greed. You left China without a thought for the people whose investments you had stolen and enjoyed for a period of time a lavish lifestyle. You lied and schemed, all the while seeking to benefit yourself,” Hales said.
    


            The businesswoman, who had pleaded guilty to money laundering offenses and transferring and possessing criminal property, was sentenced Tuesday to 11 years and eight months at Southwark Crown Court.
    


            She was sentenced alongside her accomplice Seng Hok Ling, 47, a Malaysian national who was accused of helping Qian transfer and launder the cryptocurrency. Ling was jailed at the same court for four years and 11 months after he pleaded guilty to one count of transferring criminal property.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Crypto Market Update: Bitcoin Slips Below $102K, Ethereum And XRP Struggle","https://www.tradingview.com/news/coinpedia:a2699ec26094b:0-crypto-market-update-bitcoin-slips-below-102k-ethereum-and-xrp-struggle/","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 17:10:18 GMT","

Bitcoin and Ethereum are struggling to stay above support zones after another wave of selling hit the market. The bullish energy that drove prices higher earlier this month is fading, and the clock is ticking for a strong recovery.

Bitcoin recently faced rejection near $104,000 and slid back toward $102,000. A close below that level could open the door for another move down toward $98,000. That range has acted as support several times, but repeated retests often make it fragile.

Bitcoin Faces “Make or Break” Moment

Price action on the daily chart shows a steady pattern of lower highs and lower lows, a sign of a continuing downtrend. Unless Bitcoin pushes back above $104,000–$106,000 soon, the next stop may be below the $100,000 line.

The current setup hints at a possible “death cross” — a point where short-term moving averages slide under long-term ones. Such formations often pull prices lower before any recovery attempt begins.

A brief bounce remains possible if the $98,000 support holds. Reclaiming lost ground above $104,000 would bring fresh hope of a rebound later in the month, but momentum needs to return fast.

Ethereum Struggles to Regain Strength

Ethereum is showing similar weakness. After a short recovery from around $3,000, the coin is again losing ground below resistance near $3,700. A strong daily close above that level could mark the first step toward recovery, but for now, the market remains cautious.

If selling continues, Ethereum may revisit the $2,800 zone, which has acted as a mid-range floor several times this year. The coin remains caught in a tight range with limited buying volume.

Altcoins Stay Mixed as Caution Grows

Some smaller altcoins are holding steady or showing minor rebounds, but the overall market tone remains soft. A few tokens have tried to push higher, yet none have sparked enough interest to change the broader direction.

Most digital assets are simply moving sideways while waiting for a clear shift in momentum from the top two cryptocurrencies.

Outlook for the Coming Days

The next few days could decide whether Bitcoin and Ethereum hold their ground or continue sliding lower. Strong buying near current support zones would bring some relief, but a break below could trigger another correction phase.

Price stability above $104,000 for Bitcoin and $3,700 for Ethereum remains the focus this week. If that happens, the market could regain strength heading into the second half of November.

OpenSea unveils Meetbit, an AI-powered plush toy project merging physical collectibles with blockchain, while preparing Q1 2026 SEA token launch amid FIFA World Cup opportunities.

OpenSea confirmed the launch of its AI Toy Mint, Meetbit, on Wednesday, signaling a bold new chapter for the NFT marketplace as it blends digital collectibles with real-world interaction. The project introduces Viz, an AI-powered plush toy combining adaptive intelligence with blockchain technology.

The Meebits AI Toy Mint is live on @opensea!





Mint your Early Access Pass to claim one of 1,000 Meebits x @CurioBeta Visitor AI-powered plush toys and unlock digital rewards.

Please read all details and international disclaimers on the mint site 👇https://t.co/8HrY2MBU0Y

— Meebits (@MeebitsNFTs) November 12, 2025



According to the project's website, holders of the Early Access Pass will receive exclusive early access to a limited batch of physical Viz plushies, along with digital Meebits rewards to be revealed later.



The announcement follows the debut of House of Pranksy, a collaborative project with one of crypto's earliest collectors earlier in the week. The marketplace also confirmed its support for Art Basel Miami Beach's Zero 10 initiative, a digital-first platform connecting NFT creators to the global art economy. The event is set to be held in early December 2025.

OpenSea's latest moves come after founder Devin Finzer confirmed expansion plans for 2026, including a native SEA token launch expected as early as Q1.

In an exclusive interview with Coinspeaker, Atleta Network CEO Dima Saksonov discusses Web3 and sport collectibles, offering expert insights into OpenSea's recent decision to launch a native token and plans for the World Cup 2026 hosted in the US and Mexico.

Regarding OpenSea's relevance to sports and collectibles today, Saksonov explains that OpenSea is still a place where many everyday collectors start, and that matters for sport. If they roll out the SEA token effectively, the immediate effect would be more buyers and sellers actually trading and new reasons to bid, list, and refer.

“The impact on direct exchanges between fans and athletes will depend on how quickly SEA rewards plug into partner marketplaces and whether royalties, revenue shares, and ticketed access can be recognized across venues. If OpenSea shares order flow and metadata with sport-specific platforms, you get a portable reputation and better pricing for clubs and creators,” Saksonov stated.

On the opportunities for the crypto fan economy with the 2026 FIFA World Cup hosted in the US and Mexico, Saksonov notes that the tournament spans 48 teams and 104 matches across 16 cities in the US, Canada, and Mexico. FIFA measured five billion people engaged around Qatar 2022 and roughly 1.5 billion for the final.

“For the World Cup cycle, we're prioritizing areas such as simple proof-of-presence and loyalty, transparent micro-funding to clubs and approved academies, and programmable collectibles that unlock access and milestones. We're working with clubs and fostering our own football academies in host markets to pilot these mechanics around friendlies and fan festivals ahead of kickoff, with announcements closer to the event,” Saksonov noted.

In today's Finshots, we tell you why India is now rooting for its own stablecoin.

But here's a quick sidenote before we begin. Most people buy the wrong insurance.

They either overspend on cover they don't need or skip the one that really matters. So, we're conducting a 2-day Insurance Masterclass series on November 15th and 16th, where we'll show you how to choose wisely for both life and health insurance.

Limited seats only. 👉🏽 Click here to register while seats last.

Now, on to today's story.

India and the crypto world are like frenemies. The government, the central bank, and the regulators have made it pretty clear that they're not exactly crypto's biggest fans. Yet, they don't want to see the space spiral out of control either. So, they keep it on a tight leash with hefty taxes and strict rules.

But in a sudden plot twist, Polygon, one of the biggest names in the blockchain world and Anq, a homegrown fintech startup, have joined hands to build what could be India's very own stablecoin. They're calling it, the Asset Reserve Certificate (ARC), at least for now.

That naturally makes you ask, if Indian regulators have always kept crypto at arm's length, why this sudden warmth toward something like a stablecoin?

Well, first things first, India's relationship with the cryptoverse is something it might not want to build but is forced to, given everything happening in this space. And stablecoins are one such relationship.

To understand why, you'll first need a quick refresher on what stablecoins are. But if you already know what they are and don't need this, you can skip the italicised bits and jump to the paragraph after it.

So imagine now that you're really eager to invest in a cryptocurrency. Let's just assume it's Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is basically a decentralised digital currency, meaning no regulator or government controls it. It's a limited pool of digital coins that need to be “mined” by miners who solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate and record transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.

If that sounded complicated, you can understand it in depth in a series we did here, or just think of it this way. Bitcoin isn't just a currency, it's a network that allows people to transfer value securely without relying on a bank or government.

However, Bitcoin prices are highly volatile because they depend purely on market demand and speculation. It can surge today and crash tomorrow, which means if you use Bitcoin for everyday transactions like buying groceries, a kilo of potatoes could cost ₹30 today, ₹300 tomorrow, and ₹20 the next. That's impractical.

And that's exactly why the crypto world came up with something else — stablecoins! These are digital tokens that keep all the benefits of crypto (like fast, cost-effective transfers and blockchain-based transparency) but are far more stable in value.

Stablecoins get their value by tying, or “pegging”, themselves to something steady like a government currency (say the rupee or US dollar) or even a commodity like gold.

Take USDT (Tether), for instance. One USDT is meant to always equal one US dollar. It works on the simple premise that for every 1 USDT issued, the company behind it (Tether) keeps $1 in reserve, either in cash or in safe assets like US Treasury bills. So, if you give them $100, you get 100 USDT. Return those 100 USDT, and you get $100 back. That's how the price stays stable, because it's backed by real money.

It's also a great way to transfer money across borders without a traditional intermediary like a bank. It's faster and cheaper. That's why a growing share of remittances from Indians working abroad, as well as Indian traders operating overseas, are now moving to stablecoins.

But here's the thing. The global stablecoin market is worth about $250 billion, and over 98% of it is dollar-based! Two coins, USDT and USDC (issued by Circle), dominate this space, simply because the US dollar is the world's preferred reserve currency, and these coins are backed by US government securities, which are among the safest assets out there.

But again, over 80% of stablecoin transactions happen outside the US, and a big chunk of that comes from… wait for it… India.

Yup! Unofficial estimates say that India has over 314 million stablecoin users, the most in the world. Plus, nearly 60% of Indians' foreign exchange conversions are now into stablecoins. And that's not just because they're cheap, but also because of something we didn't tell you earlier — the sweet lure of arbitrage.

See, despite being pegged to something like the dollar, stablecoins are freely tradable on crypto exchanges. Their price can move slightly based on market demand and supply, but not by much, because remember, they're backed by real assets.

The stability also comes from what happens when the value of one stablecoin goes above $1, say, $1.05. That means people are paying too much for it. So traders step in and think, “Wait, I can make a profit here.” They buy new stablecoins directly from the issuing company at $1, then sell them on exchanges for $1.05. That way, they make five cents per coin. And when more traders do this, supply increases and the price naturally falls back to $1.

Now, because of these trade mechanics, USDT normally trades at a 4–5% premium in India. It's simply because Indian rules make it tricky to directly deposit or withdraw rupees from crypto exchanges through banks. Which means, less USDT comes into India through legal channels. So, when a lot of people want to buy USDT but only a small supply is available, prices go up. And, during this time, when you want to send money home from abroad, if $1 = ₹88 officially, USDT might sell for ₹91–₹92 here, which means the folks back in India receive more rupees.

This is one reason people love using stablecoins. But since, as we said, most of them are dollar-backed, it means the money essentially flows out of India and strengthens the dollar system more than the rupee system.

And that's exactly what Polygon and Anq want to change. Their plan is to keep the value tied to India's own government-backed assets, specifically government securities and Treasury bills (T-bills). That way, they hit two birds with one stone. Indian money stays within the country, boosting liquidity and strengthening India's government securities market.

But that's not the only reason behind the move. Across Asia, countries are building their own currency-backed stablecoins. Just recently, Japan launched a pilot for yen-backed stablecoins to reduce its dependence on dollar-based ones. India probably feels the need to do the same because staying on the sidelines could mean falling behind.

Still, there's a catch. Dollar-backed stablecoins have already earned a reputation for being safer and easier to trade. So, even if India rolls out its own version, how quickly demand will pick up is anyone's guess.

Then there's still the regulatory grey area around digital assets. If India greenlights stablecoins, private companies might start issuing their own versions, creating parallel payment systems outside traditional banking rails. This has been tried before, but most of those efforts and stablecoin projects fizzled out due to a lack of clear reserve backing, uncertain redemption guarantees, and, more importantly, the absence of a defined regulatory framework.

But if these guardrails eventually come into place and stablecoins gain wider adoption, there's a risk they could start challenging the government's control over the monetary system and financial stability.

In fact, China faced something similar recently. Regulators there stopped firms like Ant Group and JD.com from launching stablecoins, even after passing a new law to regulate them.

India could take a cue from that. Before unlocking the full potential of ARC or any rupee-backed stablecoin, it'll need clear rules around the broader crypto ecosystem. Because without that, the promise of innovation may just hit a policy roadblock.

Feels like we're stuck in some kind of loop now, eh?

Until next time…

Solana SOL$151.70 faces renewed selling pressure as the token tumbles from $160.72 to $152.81, posting a 4.9% decline despite continued institutional support through exchange-traded fund products. The drop occurs on elevated volume running 17.25% above the seven-day average. Active repositioning dominates rather than passive drift.

Selling intensifies following another scheduled token unlock from bankrupt Alameda Research and the FTX estate on November 11. Analyst MartyParty reports approximately 193,000 SOL tokens worth $30 million get released as part of ongoing monthly vesting. The program has been gradually distributing over 8 million tokens since November 2023. These structured releases, managed under bankruptcy oversight, typically flow to major exchanges for creditor repayment.

Institutional demand remains robust with solana spot ETFs recording their tenth consecutive day of inflows totaling $336 million for the week. Major financial institutions including Rothschild Investment and PNC Financial Services disclosed new holdings in Solana-based products. Grayscale introduced options trading for its Solana Trust ETF (GSOL) to provide additional hedging tools for institutional traders.

Alameda's systematic token releases create predictable selling pressure while institutional flows provide underlying support. SOL finds itself caught between opposing forces. The bankruptcy estate maintains approximately 5 million tokens in locked or staked positions. Smaller monthly unlocks continue through 2028 based on pre-2021 investment agreements.

The 60-minute analysis reveals accelerating bearish momentum as SOL breaks critical support at $156 amid explosive selling volume. The breakdown occurs during 15:00-16:00 UTC when price collapses from $155.40 to $152.86 on 212,000 volume—123% above the hourly average. 

This technical failure confirms the earlier support breach and establishes a descending channel targeting the $152.50-$152.80 demand zone. However, underlying strength in ETF flows suggests institutional accumulation at lower levels. Bitwise's BSOL leads weekly inflows with $118 million while maintaining its yield-focused strategy through staking rewards averaging over 7% annually.

Support/Resistance: Primary support establishes at $152.80 demand zone with secondary levels at $150; immediate resistance at $156 (former support) and $160

Volume Analysis: 24-hour volume surges 17% above weekly average during breakdown, confirming institutional repositioning rather than retail capitulation

Chart Patterns: Descending channel formation with lower highs at $156.71 and $156.13; break above $160 needed to invalidate bearish structure

Targets & Risk/Reward: Bounce potential toward $160-$165 resistance if $152.80 holds; breakdown below $150 accelerates toward $145 support levels

CoinDesk 5 Index fell from $1,792.49 to $1,759.24, declining $33.25 (-1.85%) across a $74.31 total range as strong bearish momentum emerges after failing resistance at $1,824.82, with significant institutional volume during the 15:00-16:00 selloff confirming the downward break below key support at $1,767.

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

On Tuesday night sky watchers across the U.S. were treated to a phenomenal aurora display, the product of a severe geomagnetic storm triggered by a recent burst of solar activity.

Auroras were visible in areas that included Indiana, New Jersey, northern California, Florida and Texas. That is remarkably far south for the northern lights, or aurora borealis, which are typically restricted to a doughnut surrounding the North Pole.

The southern lights, or aurora australis, were also visible in parts of Australia.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center, which forecasts the effects of solar activity on Earth and its surroundings, geomagnetic storm conditions are expected to continue at a somewhat lower level.

And the event isn't over yet. Auroras occur after the sun emits what scientists call a coronal mass ejection, or CME, in the direction of Earth. A CME is essentially a blob of the plasma and magnetic field that makes up our star. When this material interacts with the gases in Earth's atmosphere, the resulting energy transfers light up the skies.

Last night's auroras were the result of CMEs released on Sunday and Monday, but Tuesday also saw such an outburst from the sun, and experts expect it will reach Earth in the coming hours. An initial aurora forecast for tonight suggests the spectacle could continue tonight only for a more northern portion of the country.

Auroras are part of a class of phenomena dubbed space weather and are both the prettiest and the least harmful example. Other types of space weather can be dangerous to technology in orbit and even to the power grids that sustain modern life on Earth. And the current space weather activity has had a perhaps surprising side effect: delaying today's scheduled launch of a Blue Origin rocket that will carry a pair of NASA spacecraft bound to study space weather at Mars.

The challenges associated with the transition of life from water to land are profound1, yet they have been met in many distinct animal lineages2,3,4,5. These constitute a series of independent evolutionary experiments from which we can decipher the role of contingency versus convergence in the adaptation of animal genomes. Here we compare 154 genomes from 21 animal phyla and their outgroups to reconstruct the protein-coding content of the ancestral genomes linked to 11 animal terrestrialization events, and to produce a timescale of terrestrialization. We uncover distinct patterns of gene gain and loss underlying each transition to land, but similar biological functions emerged recurrently pointing to specific adaptations as key to life on land. We show that semi-terrestrial species evolved convergent functional patterns, in contrast with fully terrestrial lineages that followed different paths to land. Our timeline supports three temporal windows of land colonization by animals during the last 487 million years, each associated with specific ecological contexts. Although each lineage exhibits distinct adaptations, there is strong evidence of convergent genome evolution across the animal kingdom suggesting that, in large part, adaptation to life on land is predictable, linking genes to ecosystems.

The colonization of land by life is one of the most notable transitions in the history of Earth, substantially shaping modern ecosystems, life forms and the planet itself1. Terrestrialization has occurred multiple times independently within the animal kingdom, including among arthropods5, vertebrates4, rotifers2, molluscs6, annelids2, nematodes2, tardigrades7 and onychophorans3. Nevertheless, each of these natural experiments in terrestrialization had to overcome similar physiological and environmental challenges2. Phenotypic adaptations—such as water-retentive skin or cuticle2, adapted immune systems8, changes in skeletal design and locomotion2, elevated metabolic rates9, developmental adaptations (such as encapsulated larvae and brooding) and adaptation of vision in aerial environments10—show widespread convergence across terrestrial lineages, suggesting largely predictable responses to similar environmental pressures. At the genotype level, recent studies have shown that genomic changes, including gene innovation11, duplication12 and loss13, were crucial to major metazoan evolutionary transitions. Furthermore, specific genes (for example, aquaporin-coding genes) have been linked to terrestrialization in several clades14, and genomic changes have been associated with individual lineages15,16,17,18; these support the roles of genes related to metabolism, stress response, osmoregulation and immunity in terrestrialization. However, in comparison to land plants19, the genomic basis of terrestrialization across animal lineages remains largely uncharacterized. These parallel natural experiments provide a unique opportunity to determine whether terrestrialization has led to lineage-specific contingent genomic adaptations or whether these are predictable changes in response to the same environmental challenges.

Here we apply a comparative genomics pipeline to a dataset of 154 genomes to explore the role of convergence and contingency in the evolutionary response of animal genomes to the process of terrestrialization, and to establish the timeline of acclimatization of animals to land. Our results reveal that independent terrestrial events were driven by the emergence of similar biological functions, although semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial lineages exhibit different patterns of genomic adaptation to terrestrialization. We identify three temporal windows in which animals colonized land, offering a new chronological framework for these transitions.

We designed an approach that we named intersection framework for convergent evolution (InterEvo), which identifies the intersection of biological functions between different sets of genes that were independently gained or reduced in different nodes along the phylogeny (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Methods). In brief, we mined 154 genomes—151 from 21 animal phyla and 3 from non-animal holozoans (Fig. 1, Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1)—and filtered them by completeness. These represent the diversity of animals and our sampling focuses on species flanking nodes that represent terrestrialization events. In this dataset, we identified 11 such events20 (Fig. 1): node 1 bdelloid rotifers, node 2 clitellate annelids, node 3 Stylommatophora (land gastropods), node 4 nematodes (roundworms), node 5 tardigrades (water bears), node 6 onychophorans (velvet worms), node 7 arachnids, node 8 myriapods (centipedes and millipedes), node 9 Armadillidium (woodlice), node 10 Hexapoda (insects and allies) and node 11 tetrapods (land vertebrates). For Onychophora, Tardigrada and Malacostraca (Armadillidium), only one or two genomes were available at the time of starting these analyses.

The phylogeny is based on 154 sampled taxa, with taxon sampling numbers shown after clade names in parentheses. Terrestrial events are highlighted in green text. HG content of terrestrial nodes is displayed in each corresponding box (from left to right, top to bottom: novel HGs, novel core HGs, expanded HGs, contracted HGs and lost HGs). Branch lengths are scaled to evolutionary time, with divergence times and 95% highest posterior density intervals indicated for terrestrial nodes. Organism silhouettes (sourced from phylopic.org and the authors, released under public domain dedication (CC0 1.0 Universal)) represent the 11 terrestrial events. Geological time abbreviations are as follows: Neop., Neoproterozoic (part); Camb., Cambrian; Ord., Ordovician; Sil., Silurian; Dev., Devonian; Carb., Carboniferous; Perm., Permian; Tri., Triassic; Palg., Paleogene; Ng., Neogene; Q., Quaternary. Myr, million years.

The 3,934,362 protein sequences from these genomes were clustered into 483,458 homology groups (HGs), groups of proteins that have distinctly diverged from other groups, comprising orthologues and/or paralogues21. Using a previously described approach11,13,19, we reconstructed the HG content for the key nodes in the tree and classified the HGs based on their mode of evolution: gene gains (novel, novel core and expanded) and gene reductions (contracted and lost). Novel HGs are those that are present in the ingroup and absent in all the outgroups, with core HGs being present in all the species of the ingroup (permitting one absence). Lost HGs are those that are absent in the ingroup but present in the sister groups and other species in outgroup. Finally, we used CAFE522 to infer expanded or contracted HGs, which are those presenting an increase or reduction, respectively, in the number of gene copies (more detailed definitions are provided in Methods and Supplementary Table 2).

Terrestrialization nodes are characterized by a large turnover of gene gains and reductions (Fig. 2). All terrestrial lineages display large gene gains (novel genes and expansions) compared to their immediate ancestors, except arachnids, hexapods and the novel genes in myriapods. Novelty is much higher in bdelloid rotifers, nematodes, tetrapods and land gastropods, the latter only in gene expansions, a finding supported by a previous study15. Similarly, terrestrial gene reduction (losses and contractions) is pervasive except in arachnids and hexapods; there is no increase in gene loss in land gastropods, tetrapods and bdelloid rotifers, the latter probably due to the massive losses in the last common ancestor (LCA) of the sampled rotiferans. Nematoda, Tardigrada and Onychophora show the largest gene losses, in agreement with previous studies12,13, together with Rotifera. Although sparse taxon sampling and the fast-evolving nature of some lineages can inflate gene turnover estimates13,23, the pattern persists after normalization by divergence time, measured as the accumulation of novel and novel core HGs per million years (Supplementary Table 3). Expansion and contraction need no correction as the birth–death model is intrinsically scaled by branch length. For the significance of gene turnover, a permutation test confirmed that the observed novel gene rates found in terrestrial lineages are significantly higher than in aquatic nodes (P = 0.0015; Extended Data Fig. 3a and Supplementary Information section 1.1.1). In summary, most terrestrialization events seem to display high levels of gene turnover, reflecting genome plasticity24 during the animal transition from water to land associated with new environmental challenges. Arachnids and hexapods show lower levels of plasticity, which may indicate that their evolution was dominated by gene co-option instead.

A total of 154 genomes were analysed to infer HGs and reconstruct ancestral states. Each bar chart represents one terrestrial event node and its three immediate ancestors. For each node, five categories of HGs are quantified: novel, novel core, expanded, contracted and lost. The y axis indicates the number of HGs in each category of each clade. Organism silhouettes (sourced from phylopic.org and the authors, released under public domain dedication (CC0 1.0 Universal)) represent 11 terrestrial events.

To infer functional convergence across the 11 terrestrial events, we annotated the functions of their novel and novel core HGs using both gene ontology (GO)25,26 and Pfam protein domains27. The number of shared GO terms among at least ten nodes are shown in Fig. 3a and shared Pfams among at least five nodes are shown in Fig. 3c. For novel HGs, there are 118 GO terms shared by different combinations of at least 10 nodes (green bars in Fig. 3a; Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Fig. 1), and 26 for novel core HGs (blue bars in Fig. 3a, and Supplementary Table 4). Our analyses show that novel gene families that emerged independently in different terrestrialization events are involved in osmosis (regulation of water transport in cells), metabolism (namely fatty acids, probably related to changes in diet), reproduction, detoxification, sensory reception and reaction to stimuli. All gene families reported here stem from the genome-wide comparative analysis of every HG, and none was chosen a priori.

a, Distribution of shared GO terms of gene novelty across terrestrialization. Bars indicate the number of GO terms from novel HGs and novel core HGs shared by at least ten terrestrial nodes. The UpSet diagram was generated using the UpSetR R package60. b, Tree map visualization of GO terms from novel HGs shared across terrestrialization. The 55 most specific GO terms from the 118 shared novel HGs are grouped into 3 major GO categories: biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. Tree maps were generated with REVIGO61. The hierarchical layout illustrates the relationships among GO terms within each category. c, Distribution of shared Pfam domains of gene novelty across terrestrialization. Bars indicate the number of Pfam domains from novel HGs (green) and novel core HGs (blue) shared by at least five terrestrial nodes, the orange bar indicates only one Pfam domain shared among fully terrestrial lineages. These Pfams are labelled above the bars using short names.

The 55 ‘most specific' (‘bottom' in the GO hierarchy) GO functions (Fig. 3b) in novel HGs include locomotion, membrane ion transport and transporter activity (osmosis), response to stimulus and neuronal functions (detection and reaction to stimulus), as well as metabolic, reproductive and developmental processes (lifecycle and diet adaptations). Additionally, cellular components include plasma membrane (related to better nutrient uptake, cell barriers and detoxification in adaptation to life on land28) and protein-containing complex (a crucial factor of membrane protein insertion29). Pfam domains echo these functions, recovering osmoregulation by neurotransmitter-gated ion channel domains, stimulus and neuronal functions by transmembrane receptor, and detoxification by cytochrome P450 (Fig. 3c). Moreover, the total number of HGs performing these functions also increased in terrestrial nodes (Supplementary Information section 1.2.1 and Extended Data Fig. 4), especially in Bdelloidea, Clitellata, Tardigrada, Onychophora, Armadillidium and Tetrapoda. Genes encompassed by these GO terms in humans (tetrapods) and the fruit fly (hexapods) also highlight the importance of biological functions linked to terrestrialization (Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Information section 1.2.2). Biological functions specific to terrestrial nodes further support these key adaptations to survival in terrestrial environments. Unique GO or unique Pfams are GO terms or Pfams associated with novel genes that are present in terrestrial nodes that are absent in the GO terms or Pfams of their ancestor nodes (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). All nodes except bdelloid rotifers and arachnids contain unique GOs, and all except stylommatophorans and arachnids contain unique Pfams. Shared unique GOs and Pfams are related to metabolism (fatty acid metabolism and kinase activity) and ion transport, which would have helped terrestrial animals maintain water and osmotic balance30 and allow them to interact with new terrestrial environments, diets and adapt their life cycles. Although some functions of terrestrial novel genes represent exaptations from freshwater ancestors (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 5), these novel genes remain functionally distinct from genes in aquatic lineages (Extended Data Fig. 3b and Supplementary Information section 1.1.2). Also, some functions appear to be contingent, being gained early and later lost in terrestrial events (Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 6).

For gene families predating these transitions, we investigated the presence of convergent gene expansions and contractions across the terrestrialization events using CAFE522. These gene families are shared with aquatic ancestors and relatives, so their convergent change in gene repertoire is an indication of parallel exaptations. Our analysis revealed ten HGs that significantly expanded their gene copy numbers in different combinations of four terrestrial nodes (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 7); no shared expanded HGs were found in more than four events. These convergently expanded gene families are involved in detoxification, oxidative stress, metabolism and reception of stimuli. Notable examples include the gene families cytochrome P450, which has crucial roles in xenobiotic metabolism particularly in the digestive tract31; flavin-containing monooxygenases, essential for processing toxic plant metabolites32; and glutathione S-transferase, which reduces reactive oxygen species and shows contraction in cetaceans33. We also find expansions in the G-protein-coupled receptor family, which is crucial for sensing environmental stimuli such as odours and light34. GO term enrichment analysis of expanded HGs, using the bilaterian ancestral genes as background, further supported the importance of stimulus response and ion transport functions in terrestrialization (Supplementary Information section 1.2.3, Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 8).

a, Shared expanded HGs across terrestrial nodes. b, Shared contracted HGs across terrestrial nodes. The UpSet diagrams show the intersections of HGs across different combinations of 11 terrestrial nodes. Bars indicate shared expanded and contracted HGs among at least four terrestrial events (green), semi-terrestrial events (blue), and fully terrestrial events (orange). Semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial groups are differentiated by blue and orange in set sizes (bottom left). HGs with no more than three members are labelled above the bars, other HGs are listed in Supplementary Table 7 (expanded) and Supplementary Table 10 (contracted). Approaches for HGs expansion and contraction inference and functional annotations are described in the Methods.

In summary, our results suggest that gene gains (novel, novel core and expanded gene families) are a key driver across all the transitions from water to land, indicating that functions such as response to stimuli, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism and ion transporter activity had an important role in these adaptive processes.

Gene reduction is another important genetic change in terrestrial events, including lost and contracted genes. Lost HGs are relatively higher in number than gene gains in most nodes (Fig. 2). We identified lost HGs shared in terrestrial events (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 9) and found the Dbl-homology domain gene family lost in 8 out of 11 terrestrial events, and the pleckstrin-homology domain gene family lost in 7 out of 11 terrestrial events; these are retained mainly in bdelloids, stylommatophorans, myriapods and tetrapods. For reference, there are no gene families convergently expanded or contracted in more than four nodes (Fig. 4), thus finding lost HGs in seven or eight terrestrial nodes is remarkable. Both domains are components of guanine nucleotide exchange factors of Rho GTPases (RhoGEF), implicated in regeneration (neurons35 and muscles36) and wound healing37. Other lost HGs among terrestrial events include chlorophyllase protein family (chlorophyll degradation38), potentially indicating dietary shifts during land colonization, and the Shugoshin C-terminal domain-containing protein, which regulates chromosome cohesion and segregation during meiosis and is involved in reproduction39.

Gene families showing convergent reduction in copy number also point to key adaptations to life on land. There are four HGs that are convergently contracted in at least four terrestrial lineages (green bars in Fig. 4b, and Supplementary Table 10): chloride channel protein members (osmoregulation40), two different carbohydrate sulfotransferases (extracellular communication and adhesion41), and melatonin-related receptors (circadian rhythms42).

We categorized the terrestrial lineages as semi-terrestrial or fully terrestrial according to their dependence on water, as no consensus definition of terrestriality is universally accepted. Semi-terrestrial animals rely on humid environments to avoid drying out, and include bdelloid rotifers, nematodes, tardigrades and some microscopic annelids, which require a film of water or pore spaces to live in43, as well as onychophorans and other annelids (such as clitellates). Fully terrestrial animals are less water-dependent, and encompass lineages such as land gastropods44, Arachnida, Myriapoda, Armadillidium (woodlice), Hexapoda5 and Tetrapoda. We compared GO and Pfam compositions associated with novel genes of terrestrial animal clades to capture function variation, performing both principal component analysis (PCA; Supplementary Fig. 8) and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA; Fig. 5 and Supplementary Information section 1.3). In the PCoA based on Jaccard dissimilarity, semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial groups showed partial separation, and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) confirmed significant differences between the two groups with both GO terms (Fig. 5a; R2 = 0.0995, P < 0.01) and Pfams (Fig. 5b; R2 = 0.0992, P < 0.01); group dispersions did not differ (GOs: P = 0.128; Pfams: P = 0.064). The enriched novel gene functions reveal that semi-terrestrial species carry an expansive and versatile toolkit for environmental flexibility, emphasizing cuticle remodelling, visual development and stress response, while fully terrestrial species display a small and streamlined set centred on neuronal development and ion membrane homeostasis vital for permanent colonization (Supplementary Table 11).

Each dot represents 1 of the 61 sampled terrestrial species, coloured by taxonomic group as indicated in the legend. Distances between dots correspond to Jaccard dissimilarities. Statistical ellipses highlight the semi-terrestrial group (orange; including Bdelloidea, Clitellata, Nematoda, Tardigrada and Onychophora) and the fully terrestrial group (green; including Stylommatophora, Arachnida, Myriapoda, Armadillidium, Hexapoda and Tetrapoda). Ellipses were generated using normal distribution parameters to visualize clustering patterns of taxonomic groups (95% confidence). The two axes represent the first two principal coordinates (PCoA1 and PCoA2) with their respective explained percentages of variation. Group separation was tested with PERMANOVA, which showed the significant differences between semi- and fully terrestrial groups for GO terms (R2 = 0.0995, P < 0.01) and Pfam domains (R2 = 0.0992, P < 0.01). Group dispersions did not differ (GOs: P = 0.128; Pfams: P = 0.064). Approaches for functional annotations are described in the Methods.

Notably, consistent with this expansive-versus-streamlined enrichment pattern, semi-terrestrial groups share broad biological functions whereas fully terrestrial lineages show little overlap. Gene gains (Supplementary Information sections 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 and Supplementary Fig. 9 for novel genes, Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 7 for expanded genes) across semi-terrestrial lineages converged on crucial functions for land adaptation, including circulatory system development, osmoregulation, nutrient processing, muscle function, energy metabolism, detoxification and sensory response mechanisms. These adaptations enabled essential physiological processes required for semi-terrestrial animals to cope with soil-dependent environments, from basic survival needs such as gas exchange, locomotion and nutrient uptake to environmental challenges such as osmotic stress and exposure to pollutants. By contrast, fully terrestrial lineages show limited convergence in the functions associated with gene novelty, with no shared GO terms and only one Pfam domain among novel genes and few shared expanded HGs (Figs. 3c and 4a, Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Information section 1.3.4). Most shared adaptations among fully terrestrial lineages are found in arthropods, where each terrestrial lineage emerged independently from aquatic ancestors that likely started from a similar genetic toolkit and evolved parallel streamlining later. Only glucose transport and stimulus sensing mechanisms are shared between woodlice and land snails, suggesting that fully terrestrial lineages probably evolved through diverse rather than common adaptive patterns. In addition, both semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial lineages display diverse gene reduction patterns, with few shared reductions (Fig. 4b for contraction, Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 14 for lost genes) except within arthropods, indicating low convergence of gene reduction across both habitat categories.

By uncovering novel core and exclusively expanded HGs, we inspected the gene functions associated with each of the 11 terrestrial nodes (Supplementary Information section 1.4 and Supplementary Tables 15–18). These include stress-response genes in bdelloid rotifers, nervous system and muscle adaptations of clitellates, shell formation, mucus secretion and estivation genes in land snails, and cuticle-related genes in nematodes. Tardigrades exhibit unique stress-resistance genes, whereas onychophorans share traits such as oxygen adaptation and nutrient uptake with woodlice. Arthropods and tetrapods, as well-studied terrestrial lineages, were further explored for their distinct adaptations.

Arthropods, the most diverse animal phylum, originated in the sea and colonized the land multiple times independently. In this study, we focus on the fully terrestrial clades Hexapoda, Myriapoda and Arachnida and the crustacean Armadillidium5 (Supplementary Information section 1.4.7). These lineages exhibit convergent evolution of traits for terrestrial adaptation, such as exoskeleton structure, water conservation and sensory development (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 7). For instance, myriapods and hexapods expand gene families linked to the synthesis of the exoskeleton wax layer responsible for waterproofing45. Similarly, retinol-binding protein genes required in the retinal pigment cells expanded in arthropods to adapt their vision to light conditions on land46. Hexapods5 show enriched GO annotations in expanded genes (Supplementary Table 15) related to moulting (for example, terpenoid metabolic process, juvenile hormone metabolic process, sesquiterpenoid metabolic process and steroid metabolic process) and vision (for example, rhodopsin biosynthetic process).

The other major lineage of terrestrial animals is land vertebrates (Supplementary Information section 1.4.8), which show both novel and expanded genes with enriched GO annotations related to immunity functions (Supplementary Table 18 for novel HGs, Supplementary Tables 15 and 16 for expanded HGs): T cell co-stimulation, positive regulation of activated T cell proliferation, and innate immunity-related processes (for example, neutrophil degranulation and specific granule lumen). Similar innate immunity functions are also found in expanded gene families, such as the Ly-6/uPAR family, siglecs, mucins and resistin. Previous studies have also supported innate immunity as crucial to evolving a specialized and reinforced epidermis with an active keratinization process and a resistant outer stratum corneum47. These defend against pathogens that spread in the terrestrial environment, forming both physical and chemical barriers48, as evidenced by our study.

The invasion of land by life influenced global biogeochemical cycles through effects on carbon storage and weathering, representing a notable milestone in the evolutionary history of the planet1. Land plant colonization paved the way to new habitats for animals and fungi and produced the emergence of new ecosystems49. Molecular timescales estimate the age of lineages, including soft-bodied animals that may not be well-represented in the fossil record. Here we focus on the terrestrialization events for which we have more than one taxon or genome. Our molecular evolutionary timescale (Fig. 1) is congruent with other recent studies50 and shows that the animal conquest of land occurred in three major temporal windows. These windows might not overlap and may be separated by millions of years, each contributing to the complexity of terrestrial ecosystems.

The first temporal window of terrestrialization occurred between the Middle Cambrian and Middle Ordovician epochs. Early land plants emerged49 approximately 515.0–473.6 million years ago (Ma), quickly followed by nematodes and arthropods. Our study suggests that nematodes (533.9–421.9 Ma), myriapods (521.9–402.8 Ma), hexapods (487.6–436.9 Ma) and arachnids (489.7–435.2 Ma) were among the first animals to transition to land, overlapping the rise of early land plants; an arthropod-focused study similarly reports temporal concordance5. A study estimated the origin of nematodes between Ediacaran and Silurian periods51 (620–455 Ma), overlapping, or even preceding, our interval. These early terrestrial species developed traits helping mitigate desiccation and providing structural support, including the arthropod exoskeletons and the nematode cuticles. In our analyses, gene gains in these lineages shared functions associated with cuticle formation, exoskeleton maintenance and lipid metabolism, as well as involvement in responses to drought, excessive light and oxidative stress (Supplementary Table 19), consistent with selection for water conservation and stress tolerance in patchy, intermittently wet terrestrial settings shaped by cryptogamic and bryophyte covers52.

The second temporal window of terrestrialization spans the Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous subperiod, a time of episodic flooding, deepening soils and strongly seasonal wetlands53. In this ecological setting, clitellate annelids (464.5–262.8 Ma) and the first tetrapods (351.2–337.7 Ma) independently adapted to land. The first land vertebrates evolved limbs for locomotion, lungs for aerial respiration and skin barriers to minimize water loss4. Clitellates adapted their nervous and muscular systems to cope with terrestrial challenges, enhancing locomotion and desiccation resistance. These species contributed to the establishment of modern terrestrial niches by enhancing nutrient cycling, improving soil structure and influencing ecosystem communities, thereby laying the conditions for further evolutionary innovations in terrestrial life. The floodplains of this period likely provided the ecological opportunities and selection pressures that drove these terrestrial transitions.

The third temporal window of terrestrialization, between 130–86 Ma during the Cretaceous period, saw bdelloid rotifers (180.9–78.4 Ma) and land gastropods (127.1–39.3 Ma) making their way onto land and sharing it with dinosaurs, as well as early mammals and birds. Bdelloid rotifers evolved exceptional stress tolerance mechanisms, including resistance to desiccation, extreme temperatures, and radiation, enabling them to thrive in harsh environments. Meanwhile, terrestrial snails developed adaptations such as shell formation, mucus secretion, and estivation to withstand diverse climatic conditions. At the molecular level, both clades exhibit gene expansions (Supplementary Table 19) in HGs, including ammonium transporters for water and ion homeostasis, NADP-dependent oxidoreductases54 and G-protein-coupled receptors for stress resistance. These shared adaptations are likely to reflect Cretaceous greenhouse landscapes, characterized by high sea levels, angiosperm expansion, coastal wetlands and seasonally dry microhabitats55 that favoured water and ion conservation and broad stress tolerance.

We applied comprehensive comparative genomic analysis to uncover the convergent evolutionary processes underlying 11 independent terrestrialization events. Our results reveal that these are marked by extensive gene turnover across all 11 lineages, adaptations to terrestrial environments. We found that terrestrial events generally display a high level of genomic novelties, mainly related to osmoregulation, stress response, immunity, sensory reception, metabolism and reproduction. We found shared ion transport functions in gene novelty, supporting their critical role in the adaptation from water to land by maintaining water and ionic balance. This is especially crucial for animals adapting to low-salinity and dry environments, as it involves changes in osmoregulation to maintain ion and water homeostasis and prevent water loss. Gene reductions show notably large numbers in terrestrial lineages, with some convergent losses of genes related to regeneration56. Although all terrestrial lineages exhibit a certain degree of convergent functional evolution, semi-terrestrial lineages share functional and molecular features, whereas fully terrestrial animals do not. However, it should be noted that habitat classifications are diverse and not universal. For example, another classification, including cryptic forms, poikilohydric organisms and homoiohydric organisms, categorizes Myriapoda and woodlice as cryptic forms2, whereas here they are classified as fully terrestrial5. More comparisons using various classifications are needed in the future. In addition to the convergent emergence of biological functions, each terrestrial lineage exhibits unique adaptations to land. The distinct features indicate the various genomic pathways to thrive in terrestrial environments. Additionally, three major temporal windows of terrestrialization identified by our molecular timescale occurred during the Ordovician, Devonian–Carboniferous and Cretaceous periods. These windows were potentially driven by major ecological and geological changes, forming new terrestrial niches. These results largely support the temporal congruence between the rise of land plants and the first window of terrestrial animals, providing new insights into the tempo of terrestrialization. There are interesting convergences between the adaptation to life on land by plants and terrestrial animals19. Plants also evolved genes linked to adaptations to life outside of the water similarly to animals, such as lignin to avoid desiccation and environmental responses (abscisic acid, salicylic acid and jasmonic acid). However, they also present new genes related to UV light protection, a signal that is not observed in animals.

The study faces certain limitations, such as the classification of terrestrialization highlighted above. Moreover, annotating lost and contracted genes poses challenges as these are lost in the most common model organisms, which are the reference for many functional annotations. For example, a significantly contracted HG in nematodes contains no gene copies in Caenorhabditis elegans and only a few poorly annotated copies in other nematodes. Functional analysis for such HGs often relies on distant homologues in humans or fruit flies, which may not accurately reflect functions owing to substantial sequence divergence across lineages. In more extreme cases, where the HGs are lost in traditional model organisms, annotation becomes virtually impossible. Similarly, many lost genes are classified as uncharacterized proteins, reflecting their absence in well-studied terrestrial models. Another methodological limitation is that we did not determine whether gene duplications occurred at the terrestrial nodes or independently within lineages, as CAFE5 infers gene expansions based on copy number, not gene trees. However, the observed expansions remain robust and meaningful as they consistently occur in terrestrial lineages, regardless of when they arose. Also, although our study relies on a robust phylogenetic framework, phylogenetic position incongruence complicates interpretations of terrestrial transitions, such as the debated relationships with Chelicerata. We followed recent studies that place Xiphosura as the sister group to Arachnida57, implying a single origin of terrestrialization in arachnids, whereas some placements propose that Xiphosura may be nested within arachnids58, which would suggest an alternative scenario. Additionally, there is limited taxon sampling for certain lineages, such as tardigrades, onychophorans and woodlice, which may lead to HG numbers that are not representative of the gene content of the clade. In the future, with more and more genomes being sequenced, the inclusion of more taxa in datasets will be possible. Future efforts should also focus on developing advanced annotation tools for lost and contracted genes, such as machine learning approaches (for example, language models59) to overcome challenges caused by sequence divergence and limited homologues. Moreover, improving gene family expansion inference by integrating gene tree-based approaches will be crucial to pinpoint duplication events more precisely.

This study uses an integrative approach, seamlessly combining comparative genomic analysis, functional annotation and evolutionary timescale reconstruction. By leveraging the InterEvo framework, which assesses the overlap of biological functions in genes repeatedly gained or reduced in these transitions, we systematically reveal the convergent genomic patterns across diverse metazoan taxa, capturing the breadth of animal diversity and providing a robust methodology for studying convergent genome evolution. Furthermore, the analysis incorporates diverse comparisons across terrestrial lineages, offering a comprehensive perspective on both global trends and category-specific patterns of terrestrial adaptations. Many genomic adaptations to terrestrial animal life are convergent, suggesting broadly predictable molecular responses. Yet, convergence is part of the story. Each terrestrial lineage also displays its own contingent adaptations, shaped by its unique evolutionary history, genomic background and ecological context. Even when facing similar challenges, different lineages often arrive at distinct molecular solutions, reflecting their ancestral constraints and trajectories. Terrestrialization, therefore, illustrates the interplay between convergence and contingency, highlighting both the repeatability and the uniqueness of evolutionary innovation.

We compiled 154 genome samplings from published projects uploaded in UniProt62, NCBI63, Ensembl64 and other resources (Supplementary Table 1). 154 genomes were downloaded, containing 3,934,362 predicted proteins, including 151 metazoan and 3 unicellular organism genomes. A side script provided by OrthoFinder (primary_transcript.py) and Cd-hit v.4.8.1 (ref. 65) (using a similarity threshold of 1.00) were used to extract the canonical proteins from the original data. The quality of canonical proteins from 154 genomes were assessed by BUSCO v.5.4.7 (ref. 66) (Supplementary Table 1). The completeness greater than 85% and fragmentation less than 15% were preferable. It should be noted that we considered not only genome completeness but also the habitat and phylogeny of the species, so we selected some genomes that did not perfectly meet the above standard. We then inferred HGs by Orthofinder v.2.5.5 (ref. 67), using dependencies of MAFFT v.7.505 (ref. 68) and DIAMOND v.2.1.8 (ref. 69). The HGs were then used for analysing gene content.

We drew a guide tree that was used for gene expansions/contractions analyses and the later time tree. This guide tree, based on the species positions inferred from previous literature70,71,72,73, was used to build the phylogeny of metazoans through the following steps. While some nodes are controversial (namely the position of sponges, ctenophors, or acoels), they are far removed from the terrestrial nodes of interest. First, we started from the conserved single-copy genes in the Metazoa_odb10 from BUSCO v.5.4.7 (ref. 66). Homo sapiens contains 943 of these genes, which were extracted to serve as reference orthologous. These identified conserved protein sequences were aligned using MAFFT v.7.505 (ref. 68) and trimmed using trimAl v.1.4.rev.15 (ref. 74) to remove poorly aligned regions. Next, we concatenated the trimmed alignments into a single supermatrix using FASconCAT-G v.1.05.1 (ref. 75). Finally, the concatenated supermatrix was used to build the phylogeny with IQ-TREE v.2.2.2.6 (ref. 76), using C60 + G + I model, using the guide tree as a constraint, and performing 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The resulting phylogeny, with branch lengths representing genetic changes, was subsequently used in CAFE5 for further analysis (see following methods).

Novel HGs: HGs that are present in at least one species within the LCA of a lineage (following we called a node), while being absent in all species of outgroup.

Novel core HGs: HGs that are present in all species within a node (or absent only once for node containing more than three species), while being absent in all species of outgroup. For the node with two species, novel HGs are equal to novel core HGs.

Lost HGs: HGs that are lost in all species within a node, while being present in the sister groups and other species in outgroup.

Expanded HGs: the increase in the number of gene copies occurred within HGs, often due to gene duplication events.

Contracted HGs: the reduction in the number of gene copies occurred within HGs.

Ancestral HGs: all HGs present in a node.

Novel, novel core and lost HGs were inferred by our host pipeline Phylogenetically Aware Parsing Script described by Paps and Holland11 (GitHub: https://github.com/PapsLab) with Perl v.5.30.0.

Expanded and contracted HGs were inferred by CAFE522. First, we generated an ultrametric phylogenetic tree with ape, TreeTools and phytools packages in R, based on phylogenetic tree built using IQ-TREE. CAFE5 was launched with the ultrametric tree. Owing to the large dataset, we were unable to run the entire phylogeny at once; therefore, we split the phylogeny into three smaller trees: Lophotrochozoa, Ecdysozoa and Deuterostomia. For each smaller tree, CAFE5 was run with Poisson distribution and error model, applying two- and three-lambda models ten times each to test convergence of Model Base Final Likelihood (-lnL). We selected the highest lnL from two- and three-lambda models to compare their fit using a likelihood ratio test with chi-squared distribution (via lmtest package in R), which indicated that three-lambda models are a better fit for all three phylogenies (P < 0.001). However, further tests using simulation function of CAFE5 revealed that values (including lambda and -lnL) of three-lambda model of Deuterostomia fluctuated, while that of two-lambda model were stable, thus the two-lambda model was judged to be the better fit for this phylogeny. For Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa, the simulation tests showed stable values for the three-lambda models, which were therefore chosen as the better fit (Supplementary Table 20).

To test the robustness, novel core HGs were tested by BLASTp v.2.14.0 +77 using NCBI RefSeq database78 (downloaded on 23 August 2023), which contains a broad range of high-quality molecular sequences. We launched BLASTp locally and searched novel core HGs against RefSeq records, excluding protein sequences from the in-groups (terrestrial nodes) with the option “-negative_taxidlist”. The results shown that BLASTp returned very weak hits; the vast majority of sequences had e-value > 10−10 and identity <50% (Supplementary Table 21).

We evaluated if the number of novel genes emerging per million years in terrestrial nodes differ from aquatic nodes. We collected the rate of emergence of novel gene in 11 terrestrial nodes and randomly selected 11 aquatic nodes (Actinopterygii, Ambulacraria, Bivalvia, Branchiopoda, Chondrichthyes, Cnidaria, Decapoda, Platyhelminthes, Priapulida, Sabellida and Vetigastropoda). We calculated the observed total evolutionary rate in the 11 terrestrial nodes as the total number of novel HGs divided by total divergence time (Rterr = 4.900). We then performed 10,000 bootstrap draws: in each permutation we sampled (with replacement) 11 aquatic nodes from this pool, recalculated the evolutionary rate (Rboot = total novel HG counts divided by total divergence time) and recorded the value, producing a null distribution of novel gene rates in aquatic nodes. The empirical one-tailed P value was the proportion of bootstraps with Rboot ≥ Rterr.

We assessed if the GO term composition of terrestrial lineages differs from that of aquatic lineages. We included lineages with the biggest taxon sampling from random aquatic lineages, including Actinopterygii, Ambulacraria, Bivalvia, Branchiopoda, Cnidaria, Decapoda and Platyhelminthes. We converted the GO matrix derived from the novel genes for each lineage into a binary presence/absence matrix, then quantified the dissimilarity between terrestrial and aquatic GO term profiles by measuring the proportion of non-shared terms (Jaccard distance). For the permutation test, we randomly reshuffled the ‘aquatic/terrestrial' labels across lineages 10,000 times; in each permutation we rebuilt the two group profiles and recalculated Jaccard distance between them. The empirical P value was the proportion of permutations distance ≥ the observed distance.

Both analyses were conducted in R using the packages vegan, car and ggplot2.

For each terrestrial event, we selected one species as representative. Rotaria sordida in Bdelloidea, Eisenia andrei in Clitellata, Candidula unifasciata in Stylommatophora, Pristionchus pacificus in Nematoda, Ramazzottius varieornatusa in Tardigrada, Epiperipatus broadwayi in Onychophora, Centruroides sculpturatus in Arachnida, Rhysida immarginata in Myriapoda, Armadillidium nasatum in Armadillidium, Drosophila melanogaster in Hexapoda, H. sapiens in Tetrapoda. For annotating Pfam domains and GO terms of the HGs of interest, egg-NOG-mapper v.2 (ref. 79) was applied online with default parameters. Further analysis of names of genes of interest was performed in UniProt62 using mapping IDs in sequence headers. We also used PANTHER 19.0 (ref. 80) to classify genes with ‘protein class'.

We conducted GO enrichment analysis to find overrepresented GO terms in novel and expanded HGs of terrestrial events, using background of GO terms hitting all HGs present in the LCA of Bilateria. Using Fisher's exact test, we compared the number of HGs hitting each GO term between the terrestrial events and bilaterian background. The P values for multiple comparisons were corrected with the Benjamini–Hochberg method. GO terms with adjusted P values < 0.05 were considered significantly enriched. In another way, we also used all HGs present in the LCA of terrestrial events as background to perform enrichment analysis, such as GO terms hitting expanded HGs of hexapods comparing with GO terms hitting all HGs present in LCA hexapods. However, to ensure normalization across all terrestrial events, we chose bilaterian background for the following analysis.

To identify biological functions driving the separation of semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial groups (following the PCoA), we tested differential presence of GO terms or Pfams between semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial groups using binary matrices (present/absent). Functional terms that lacked variability (present in all species or in none) were discarded. For every remaining feature we compiled a 2 × 2 contingency table (presence/absence number of species in two habitat categories) and subjected it to a two-tailed Fisher's Exact Test in R, using the marginal totals across entire pool of species as the background. P values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. The functional terms with adjusted P < 0.05 were considered significantly enriched and those of P < 0.01 were reported. To retain biological relevance, we excluded the functional terms present in ≤10% proportion in both groups.

To compare the distribution in GO terms linked to novel and ancestral HGs among semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial lineages, we performed a PCA. PCA was conducted using the prcomp function in R. The GO terms of species were plotted using the first two principal components, PC1 and PC2. Statistical analyses were applied to assess differences between semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial groups. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD) test was performed on the principal components scores to evaluate significant differences among these two groups and pairwise comparisons. Then, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted to examine the combined effect of these two groups on PC1 and PC2, respectively. Two ellipses, using normal distribution-based ellipse fitting, were merged based on their habitats, representing semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial groups. The semi-terrestrial group includes bdelloid rotifers, clitellates, nematodes, tardigrades and onychophorans, while fully terrestrial group includes stylommatophorans, arachnids, myriapods, Armadillidium, hexapods and tetrapods. The analyses were performed in R using the ggplot2, ggforce and car packages.

However, because shared absences might bias Euclidean-based PCA on binary presence/absence data, inflating similarity between groups that simply lack many of the same features, we further performed PCoA. We quantified compositional differences in GO term and Pfam presence/absence profiles between semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial species based on Jaccard dissimilarity. Pairwise dissimilarities among species were computed using the Jaccard distance in vegan R package. We then performed PCoA on the Jaccard distance matrix. The two axis labels explain the percentages of Jaccard distance variation. To test for overall group difference between semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial groups, we performed a PERMANOVA (adonis2 function) on the Jaccard distances with 10,000 permutations, with reassigning species to the two groups. To confirm the PERMANOVA results are not driven by unequal within-group spread, we tested for homogeneity of multivariate dispersion using betadisper function with permutations of sample–group labels (centroids recomputed each 999 permutation). Plots were generated using ggplot2 package and group ellipses represent 95% concentration regions. The comparison between freshwater and terrestrial species used the same methods described above.

Molecular clock analysis was performed using a two-step approach in MCMCTree81 (PAML package82). Using the previously described concatenated alignment of 943 conserved orthologous genes generated using BUSCO v.5.4.7 (ref. 66), MAFFT v.7.505 (ref. 68), trimAl v.1.4.rev.15 (ref. 74) and FASconCAT-G v.1.05.1 (ref. 75). The analysis was conducted in two steps. In the first step, branch lengths were estimated by maximum likelihood using CODEML83, which calculated the gradient and Hessian of the likelihood function at the maximum likelihood estimates. We used the Empirical + F model (model = 3) and an independent rates clock model (clock = 2). Subsequently, MCMCTree was executed to estimate divergence times, using the same independent rates clock model and discrete gamma distribution with 4 categories and a shape parameter alpha = 0.5. Using an R script provided by MCMCTree tutorial (GitHub: https://github.com/sabifo4/Tutorial_MCMCtree), the prior for the substitution rate was determined based on the approximate root age (591.255 Ma), resulting in a gamma distribution with shape α = 2 and scale β = 5.1. For each analysis, we ran the MCMC for about 20 million generations, with the first 100,000 generations discarded as burn-in, sampling every 1,000 generations to obtain 20,000 samples. To ensure convergence and reliability of the results, we performed six independent Markov chain Monte Carlo runs. We assessed convergence using Tracer v.1.7.2 (ref. 84), which showed effective sample sizes exceeding 200 for all parameters across all runs. Based on the consistency of results across runs and comparative summary statistics, we selected the fourth run for our final divergence time estimates (Supplementary Table 22).

The pipeline used in this study comprises three main analyses following homology group (HG) inference and ancestral genome reconstruction. Analyses of expanded HGs, contracted HGs, and lost HGs involve identifying HGs shared across transition nodes. Analyses of novel and expanded HGs involve identifying shared biological functions (including Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Pfam domains) across transition nodes, followed by enrichment analysis. The workflow integrates comparative genomics, homology inference, and functional annotation to detect convergent evolution patterns across independent terrestrialisation events.

Spatiotemporal gating in signal transduction and corresponding activation or inhibition of a biochemical pathway is the hallmark of biological functionality. Herein, through both experimental and computational approaches, we developed a synthetic system to mimic one of the key biological signaling events - local inhibition and distal (long-range) activation (LIDA). The basis of our system lies in the differential diffusivity of – (i) injected dormant activator or pro-activator (Pro-A, urea, fast to diffuse due to non-binding with nanoparticle (NP) in gel matrix) that converts to activator (A, ammonium bicarbonate) via an enzyme (urease) embedded in the hydrogel) and (ii) inhibitor (IN, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), diffusion restricted due to interaction with NP). Here A and IN act as the activator and inhibitor of a base-catalyzed proton transfer reaction in the gel matrix, respectively. The indispensability of ProA to A conversion during diffusion for efficient time-regulated LIDA effect has also been demonstrated. The ability to input spatial gating of pH and reaction activation can potentially be extrapolated to develop neuromorphic self-assembled systems with distal programmability.

Differential diffusivity of activators and inhibitors in a signaling system is one of the fundamental aspects for the spatiotemporal regulation of biological processes1,2,3. In 1952, Alan Turing described the importance of reaction-diffusion (RD) phenomenon for pattern formation in biology4. Since then, researchers have realized the importance of RD of biological signaling molecules in processes ranging from embryonic to organ development, NOTCH signaling pathway, localized neuronal response etc.5,6,7,8. In general, pattern formation in biological organisms has been elucidated through the Turing model, where at least two interacting and diffusing species are involved. Here, a short-range activator is autocatalytic along with a long-range inhibitor that suppresses the activation effect, resulting in limitless number of distribution patterns with two species2. In 1960s, Burnett proposed a long-range activator-cum-inhibitor model using Hydra as a model system for demonstrating its distinct head-foot end and regeneration of the head at a different location9. Subsequently in 1972, Gierer and Meinhardt categorically demonstrated different pattern polarity (along with site variability) using activator-inhibitor-based model from a source of different density, gradient and position. Here the inhibitor is faster diffusing species than the activator and initially activator and inhibitor are equally distributed10. To this end, in 1969, Wolpert proposed the seminal concept of the positional information of a cell in a morphogen gradient governs the fate of the embryonic cell during the developmental process (also known as the French flag problem)11,12. Recent reports suggest biological RD phenomenon involving short-range inhibitor and long-range activator in cases like - embryonic development for distinguishing germ layers, retrograde signaling in the nervous system, and organelles inside cells, etc.13,14,15.

Inspired by biological pattern formation, scientists are also inclined in developing reaction-diffusion based models and systems, due to their manifold applications in diverse areas, ranging from - understanding biological morphogenesis to disease spread and to the designing of dynamic and spatially resolved (bio)materials for cell growth or sensors16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25. Usually, a hydrogel matrix is used for achieving different patterns via the differential self-assembly ability or diffusion of different components26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34. Employing original and modified Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction, researchers developed different kinds of Turing-like patterns in gel matrix, Liesegang pattern using nanoparticles, controlled one-dimensional gradient pattern of supramolecular assembly etc.26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38. Additionally, diverse complex (bio)chemical reaction network-based RD systems were developed to mimic biological processes and to generate programmable or patterned soft matters and actuators39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46. A recent report demonstrated an artificial developmental process by showing a French flag pattern-based colloidal aggregation to autonomously structure a soft material via DNA-based bistable reaction networks47.

In many cases, the addition of templating agent results in localized assembly by attracting a diffusive current of non-assembled molecules from surroundings48,49,50,51. This process eventually enhanced the formation of supramolecular assembly as well as associated properties like – signal generation and catalysis. In general, the desired assembly or associated enhancement in functionality resulting from RD processes takes place locally i.e. at the source point of chemical or energy input48,49,50. However, synthetic systems with short range inhibitor and long-range activator (where the desired functionality will be activated far from source input) are not reported so far to the best of our knowledge. Only in one instance, it has been shown that local addition of high concentration of catalytic inhibitor can enhance the activity at distant place after diffusion as the inhibitor acts as an activator at low concentration52. Although this is an elegant system, it is low in complexity and is based on only one diffusing species, whereas biological system specifically uses multiple reacting and diffusing species. It is worth mentioning that creating a synthetic RD system with local inhibition and distal activation (LIDA) will benefit the repertoire of synthetic systems that mimic natural spatiotemporal signaling pathways which possess precise temporal and positional information. Such a system might also have potential in the bottom-up development of complex chemical synthetic system with neuromorphic behavior. Therefore, the realization of complex chemical RD-based systems with spatiotemporally correlated output signals as a function of input information is one of the essential requirements for mimicking neuromorphic behavior in synthetic chemical systems53,54. This would be of importance to the development of complex pattern-based recognition systems, meta-gels, dynamic soft materials for diverse material and bioengineering applications55.

In this work, we develop a chemoenzymatic reaction-diffusion-based synthetic system to exhibit LIDA effect which is an important aspect of biological signal transmission. Using a combination of experimental and computational approaches, we demonstrate this LIDA effect in a hydrogel by injecting urea and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) at the center of the gel matrix. The experimental set up and detailed discussions has been given in Fig. 1 and in subsequent section. We show a base catalyzed reaction is activated by a combination of faster diffusion of urea and product of urease reaction at the distant zone from the injection center. Also, the reaction is locally suppressed by slow diffusion of ATP (due to binding with gold nanoparticles in the gel matrix). We experimentally demonstrated that reaction activation can be spatiotemporally gated by changing the amount of injected urea and ATP ratio. We also develop a computational model for the validation of the experimental results and a general platform (with varied enzymatic catalysis, reaction rates and diffusion parameters of the components) for future development of such systems.

a Reaction scheme with involved species and b reaction-diffusion event after injection of ProA and IN at a point. Here, distant zone becomes basic in pH due to enzymatic conversion of ProA to A, resulting in activation of Kemp Elimination reaction (i.e., conversion of NBI (R) to CNP (P)). Due to the presence of acidic inhibitor in the nearby zone, the reaction is suppressed. Slower diffusion of IN in the gel is due to binding with nanoparticles embedded in gel. c Schematic of the reaction set up with components (urea as ProA and ATP as IN) and reaction schemes. At the empty circular zone (5 mm diameter) aqueous solution of (ATP + urea) or (ATP + NH4HCO3) were added and allowed to diffuse into the agarose gel matrix (0.75 wt%). Experiment with the addition of (ATP as IN + NH4HCO3 as A) has been done as control experiment, to check the direct effect of A + IN. Blue and red arrow indices faster and slower diffusion of urea and ATP through gel matrix, due to non-binding and binding of GNP, respectively. The gel is embedded with CTAB-capped GNP (0.2 nM), urease enzyme (15 nM) and NBI (0.5 mM).

Our chemoenzymatic RD system is based on a catalytic hydrogel matrix with a reaction-diffusion system (Fig. 1). As mentioned in the preceding section, we aimed in activating a reaction spatially distant from the region of addition of inputs. We chose a base-catalyzed proton-transfer ring-opening reaction (also known as Kemp Elimination (KE) reaction) for this purpose56,57,58,59. The substrate for KE reaction 5-nitrobenzisoxazole (NBI, denoted as R in the manuscript) was evenly distributed in the agarose gel matrix. This R is converted to 2-cyanonitrophenol (CNP, denoted as P) in presence of a base and the reaction gets catalyzed by cationic gold nanoparticle (GNP)56,57. Therefore, the hydrogel was also embedded with GNP. Notably, in ultrapure water (with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ·cm at 25 °C), GNP does not catalyze the conversion of R to P. An enzyme, urease (E), is also present in the gel matrix that does not react with R or GNP. E can convert a neutral molecule, urea (dormant activator or pro-activator, ProA) to a base, ammonium bicarbonate (activator, A). We named urea and ammonium bicarbonate as ProA and A, respectively as A can activate the conversion of R to P and A formed only after the enzymatic action over ProA37. As we aimed to develop a LIDA-based system, we chose an anionic molecule, ATP as inhibitor (IN) of the KE reaction. We locally injected a mixture of ProA (urea) and IN (ATP) to achieve our desired system with local or short-range inhibition and distal or long-range activation.

The reasons behind choosing ATP as IN and urea as ProA are following – (i) due to acidic nature of ATP, it is known to suppress KE reaction, and thereby, it acts as a very good inhibitor for this process. Secondly, for local inhibition, IN needs to be slow to diffuse. In our case, ATP is anionic and has a great ability to bind with cationic GNP (already embedded in gel matrix), therefore, due to binding, diffusion of IN will be restricted through the gel matrix. (ii) We chose urea as ProA. As it is neutral, it does not bind to GNP and diffuses faster than IN. Therefore, upon injecting a mixture of ProA and IN, enzymatic ProA to A conversion will take place even in a zone devoid of IN. Thus, in principle, R to P conversion will take place far away from the zone of injection of ProA and IN. However, there is always the question of whether adding A (instead of ProA) and IN would provide the same effect or not. To address this issue, we also performed control experiments both experimentally and theoretically to demonstrate that enzymatic conversion of ProA to A during diffusion is a pre-requisite for developing such a system in a well-defined manner.

For experimental verification of the above-mentioned hypothesis, we designed our system as shown in Figs. 1c and 2a. In a petri dish, agarose gel casting was performed by keeping the center with 5 mm diameter vacant. The height of the gel was 3 mm. In the vacant zone, a solution of ATP + urea or ATP + NH4HCO3 was added and allowed to diffuse through the gel matrix. The gel is also embedded with cationic CTAB-capped gold nanoparticles (GNP), urease (E) and NBI (R). We used 0.75 wt% agarose gel for all our experiments for the following reasons (Supplementary Fig. 1). We found at higher concentration of agarose gel (1 wt %) GNP gets aggregated which can decrease the NBI to CNP reaction rate and alter the diffusion behavior of ATP. The aggregation was checked by noting the ratio of absorbances A620/A520, where an increase in the ratio indicates more aggregated AuNPs60. Higher agarose concentrations create a gel with a smaller mesh size, which acts as a physical barrier to nanoparticle movement, resulting enhanced interparticle friction and clustering of nanoparticles61. In contrary, at lower agarose concentration (0.5 wt%), the time taken to complete gel formation (after dissolving agarose at 110 °C) was ~25–30 min, resulting in some background conversion of NBI to CNP, prior to the addition of any reagent at the center. Therefore, to balance both issues, we used 0.75 wt% agarose gel for our study, where GNP aggregation was negligible and gel formation was fast (~5 min). We would like to mention here that only after complete solid-like gel formation, the solution of ATP + urea or ATP + NH4HCO3 at the center was added. Additionally, while preparing gel, we did not use any salt solution, as salt like NaCl can result in GNP aggregation and inhibit the base-catalyzed NBI to CNP reaction (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Before proceeding to the experiment with gel matrix, we analyzed the system in aqueous solution (milli Q water). At first, we checked the binding of ATP and NH4HCO3 and non-binding of urea with cationic GNP surface via zeta potential measurement (Supplementary Fig. 3). Then we checked in the presence of urease, addition of urea indeed results in conversion of NBI to CNP and the time of reaction outcome depends on the amount of urea (Supplementary Fig. 4). In absence of urease, no reaction occurs, and reaction can get activated in presence of NH4HCO3 (Supplementary Fig. 5). It is worth mentioning that in our previous studies, we already demonstrated the catalytic ability of GNP for this KE reaction in urea-urease system33. We also showed that with increasing ATP content in the reaction system with urea-urease and NBI, the KE reaction rate can be significantly slowed down (Supplementary Fig. 4). For example, only 0.2 mM ATP can slow down the NBI to CNP conversion rate by 50% when 2 mM urea was used in presence of 15 nM urease. In a similar condition, upon checking the inhibitory effect of a simple salt NaCl, we found 10–15 mM NaCl is needed to decrease the production of CNP by 50% (Supplementary Fig. 2). In this case, weakly basic chloride ion can act as a competitor of basic HCO3- ion for binding with the cationic GNP surface to hinder the conversion of NBI to CNP. Using a pH probe, bromothymol blue (BTB), we established that with increasing ATP, the time required for acidic to basic transformation was increased, resulting in a delay of the base-catalyzed proton transfer reaction (Supplementary Fig. 6)56,62.

Now, for the gel experiment, we measured the formation of CNP at 8 different zones, each separated by 1 mm in a plate reader (please see experimental procedure in the methods section for details). First, we injected 40 μl volume of aqueous solution containing 50 mM urea and 5 mM ATP at the center and allowed it to diffuse through the hydrogel matrix (Figs. 1c and 2a). We then monitored the evolution of reaction product, P by following the absorbance at 380 nm wavelength over time at different points (Fig. 2b, c). Upon injecting 50 mM urea + 5 mM ATP at the center, we were pleased to observe that the formation of P did not happen near the injection center (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 7). Indeed, in this case, the maximum product was found 5 mm away from the center between 2 h to 5 h (Fig. 2e). For the initial 60 and 90 min data, we observed that the maximum product formation was taking place at zone 4 (4 mm away from center). Interestingly, while injecting 40 μl of 50 mM NH4HCO3 (product formed after urea-urease reaction) + 5 mM ATP at the center, the maximum reaction product formed in the very beginning at zone 3 (up to 60 min), and then the maximum product always formed at zone 2 (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. 8). Although in this case, the reaction rate was very high and the amount of product was almost equally distributed from zone 1 to zone 5, 6 and 8, after 1, 2 and 4 h, respectively, suggesting the difference in concentration is negligible and the product mostly formed near the injection center. We also performed an additional experiment with lower urea (25 mM) but with similar ATP of 5 mM. In this case, we found the maximum product forming zone was further away by 1 mm up to 90 min in comparison to 50 mM urea + 5 mM ATP case (Fig. 2e, Supplementary Fig. 9). At both 1 and 1.5 h, the maximum product formation was found at zone 5 which was maintained up to 5 h. Again, at fixed ATP (2.5 mM), and decreasing urea from 25 to 10 mM, the maximum product formation zone moved further away at zone 5, compared to zone 4 after 3 h (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Figs. 10, 11). These experiments clearly suggest the importance of injecting urea, instead of NH4HCO3 and enzymatic conversion of urea to NH4HCO3 during diffusion plays the key role in generating distant reaction product forming zone. Also decreasing the amount of urea injected at a fixed ATP concentration, resulted in the product formation zone moving further away from reaction center. However, at very low urea (10 mM), the amount of formed P was too low. We also performed control experiments without either urease or GNP or both in the gel matrix. In all these cases, the product formation was too low, indicating the requirement of both E and GNP for the reaction conversion (Supplementary Figs. 12–14). Next, we also checked the effect of addition of only urea in the system having GNP and urease in the gel matrix (Supplementary Fig. 15). Here also, the product formed maximally at zone 1 and diffused to other distant zones with time, showing the importance of ATP (IN) and conversion of urea (ProA) to basic ammonium ions (IN) during diffusion through gel matrix for LIDA-effect.

To avoid the error due to angular contribution, the average values of the four points (as shown in cross pattern in panel b) at the same distance were calculated and extrapolated to represent the entire circumference as circle (indicated by showing dotted circle to represent zone 1 (Z1), zone 4 (Z4) and zone 8 (Z8) in panel c). d Spatiotemporal pattern of product (CNP) formation when 40 µl of aqueous solution of 5 mM ATP and 50 mM urea (top panel) and 5 mM ATP + 50 mM NH4HCO3 (bottom panel) were injected at the central zone. The color map showed the CNP concentration at each zone. Herein, concentrations above 400 µM were shown as deep red and below 100 µM as deep blue. e The maximum product-forming zone away from the source at different time points was plotted for the injection of urea (25 mM) + ATP (5 mM), urea (50 mM) + ATP (5 mM), and NH4HCO3 (50 mM) + ATP (5 mM). The color of each symbol depicts the concentration range as shown in the color map (below 400 µM as deep blue and 500 µM as deep red). f Maximum product forming zone away from the source at different time points was plotted for injection of urea (25 mM) + ATP (2.5 mM) and urea (10 mM) + ATP (2.5 mM). The color of each symbol depicts the concentration range as shown in the color map. Data are presented as mean ± SD (where n  =  8). Source data are provided as a source data file.

The results discussed in the previous paragraph suggest that enzymatic conversion of ProA to A during diffusion is the essential factor for developing LIDA-based systems. Next, we were curious to find the reason behind this phenomenon. As KE is a base-catalyzed reaction, R to P conversion should occur at high pH. Therefore, we were interested to find out the spatiotemporal evolution of pH in the system after injection of 50 mM urea and 5 mM ATP. For this, bromothymol blue (BTB) dye was incorporated in the gel instead of NBI, along with GNP and E (Fig. 3a). At first, we calibrated the gel system at 620 nm wavelength with BTB dye using known pH value (Supplementary Fig. 16). It is worth mentioning that absorbance value at 620 nm increases with increasing pH. Interestingly, we find that the initial zones (up to 2 mm) near the injection center remain acidic (below pH 6) for about 60 min, whereas pH of zone 3 and 5, at 60 min were 7.2 and 8.1, respectively (Fig. 3b, c, Supplementary Figs. 17, 18). It clearly suggests that initially the pH remains low at the injection center but was higher at zone 4 and 5. Even after 180 min, we found pH of zone 1 was close to 7, whereas the value was 8 or higher for zone 4 onwards. As pH of the distant zone becomes higher quickly, the reaction starts at distal zones from the injection center (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Fig. 17). This also suggests that acidic ATP remains close to injection center, whereas urea moved faster and converted to basic NH4HCO3, even at distant zones to activate the KE reaction.

a Schematic of the reaction set up with components as described in Fig. 1c. In this case, pH probe Bromothymol blue (0.02 mM) was added in the gel instead of NBI. At the empty circular zone (5 mm diameter) aqueous solution of (ATP + urea) was added and allowed to diffuse to the agarose gel matrix (0.75 wt%). b A snapshot of petridish taken after 60 min, showing the initial zone is acidic (yellow color) and outer region is basic (blue color). c Spatiotemporal pattern of pH in the gel matrix with time when 40 µl of aqueous solution of 5 mM ATP and 50 mM urea was injected in the central zone. Blue indicates pH of 8 or higher and red indicates pH lower than 6. The pH of the whole gel before injection was around 5.6 as it was made with mQ water (which is slightly acidic due to dissolved CO2). d pH (blue points, left sided Y-axis) and product formation (orange points, right-sided Y-axis) with time at zone 1, zone 3 and zone 5. Data are presented as mean ± SD (where n  =  8). Source data are provided as a source data file.

After establishing the system experimentally, we were interested to explore the spatiotemporal emergence of the reaction product at different diffusion parameters, activation and inhibition constant by developing a model system. This will be of importance for further understanding the present system and how to build similar LIDA-type synthetic system, with chemical components of different diffusivity and catalytic properties. This model simulates a two-dimensional reaction-diffusion system involving six chemical species undergoing transport and/or enzymatic reactions. The system is defined in polar coordinates \((r,\,\theta )\) over a circular domain, and it accounts for both radial and angular diffusion (Fig. 4). E and R are embedded in a circular reaction matrix. ProA and IN are injected at the center and allowed to diffuse and react. We also performed control experiments with only A instead of ProA to see the difference in spatiotemporal reaction pattern.

a Scheme of the reactions used for modeling. Here similar dimensions of two-dimensional circular disc (8 mm diameter) as used in experiment were chosen. b Spatiotemporal distribution of reaction product (P) at different kIN/kA and different diffusion coefficient ratios of ProA, IN and A when ProA (50 mM) and IN (5 mM) are injected at the center (left) and A (50 mM) and IN (5 mM) are injected at the center (right). The maximum product concentration (normalized) obtained in both ProA + IN and A + IN cases are given in Supplementary Table 1. Product distribution when kIN/kA = 103, and DProA:DIN:DA = 40: 1: 1, 40: 2: 2, 40: 5: 5 and 40: 8: 8 (where DProA = 4 × 10−10 m2/s) for c ProA + IN injection and d A + IN injection at the center at 150 min. Notably, product concentration in the case of A + IN injection is higher than ProA + IN injection. For (b–d), the concentration of product was normalized with respect to the maximum product concentration obtained for the case of kIN/kA = 103 and DProA:DIN:DA = 40:2:2 at 150 min.

The governing reaction-diffusion is described by partial differential equations (PDE) of the form:

Where \(i\) is the appropriate chemical species ProA, A, I or P. \({C}_{i}\) is the concentration of the chemical species \(i\). \({D}_{i}\) is the diffusion coefficient. \({R}_{i}(C)\) represents the reaction term. A constant concentration of enzyme (E) in the matrix is assumed.

The reaction terms for: ProA → A (Michaelis-Menten equation) and R → P conversions are given in Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively.

Where \({R}_{0}\) is the initial concentration of the reactant, NBI.

In Eq. (4), kA and kIN are rate constant of A-induced activation and IN-mediated inhibition (see supplementary information for detailed derivation of Eq. (4)). Central Finite Difference Approximations are used for spatial derivatives. Neumann boundary condition (no-flux) is imposed at the center and domain boundary. A circular disc of 8 mm diameter has been chosen to follow the reaction-diffusion phenomenon, and we followed the RD system until 150 min. At first, we checked the spatiotemporal emergence of the final product P in different ratio of kIN and kA (kIN / kA = 1, 103 and 106) while adding a mixture of 50 mM ProA and 5 mM IN at the center of the circular disc. Additionally, we checked 4 different diffusion ratio of ProA, A and IN (DProA: DIN: DA = 40: 1: 1; 40: 2: 2; 40: 5: 5 and 40: 8: 8) (Fig. 4, Supplementary Figs. 19–30). Here, we assumed DProA = 4 × 10−10 m2/s (considering diffusion co-efficient of urea) and kcat/KM = 3000 mM−1s−1 (kcat = 104 s−1, KM = 3.3 mM) for enzyme urease towards substrate urea63. For screening of the simulation parameters we assume both IN and A has similar diffusion co-efficient as both can bind with GNP. The diameter of GNP is around 25 nm; therefore, we assumed that bound IN and A would be of similar diffusion co-efficient with a much lower value than ProA. Additionally, we did not consider any diffusivity of P. Simultaneously, we checked the scenario when instead of ProA, we added 50 mM A (directly added without allowing it to form through enzymatic reaction) and 5 mM IN with similar kinetic and diffusion parameters (Fig. 4, Supplementary Figs. 31–42). From the theoretical plot, we can observe a trade-off between diffusion ratio and kIN/kA. In general, for kIN/kA of 103 a clear LIDA effect was observed at all ratios of diffusion coefficients studied in this work. However, the amount of P steadily decreased with increasing diffusion of IN. After 150 min, the highest LIDA was observed in the case of kIN/kA of 106, with DProA: DIN: DA = 40: 2: 2, although the product amount was lower than the case when kIN/kA was 103. Similarly, the system will be effective for DProA: DIN: DA = 40: 5: 5 or 40: 8: 8 cases quite efficiently when kIN/kA equals 103, but not with kIN/kA of 106. In fact, we were pleased to observe while injecting only A = 50 mM and IN = 5 mM at the center, and DIN = DA (1:1), the product always formed close to the injection center and the amount of product was higher than the case when (ProA + IN) was injected (Fig. 4b–d, Supplementary Table 1).

After analyzing the above data, we fixed DProA: DIN: DA = 40: 2: 2 and kIN/kA to 103 to explore the spatiotemporal emergent behavior of P with different concentration ratios of ProA and IN injection at the center. This model output is comparable to our observed experimental result (Supplementary Figs. 43, 44). We fixed the amount of IN to 5 mM and decreased the amount of ProA to 25 and 10 mM. In this case we found that, with low ProA (10 mM), maximum P emerged at a distant zone (3 mm away from the center) beforehand (in terms of time) than in the other two cases (Supplementary Fig. 45). In a similar manner we fixed the amount of ProA to 50 mM and found that, with increasing IN, maximum P was formed at a distant zone at earlier time point compared to low IN (Supplementary Fig. 46). Lower ProA or higher IN results in enhanced inhibition, therefore, maximum product was found at more distant zone. However, with high IN or low ProA, the amount of product is low and in some cases, negligible. Both simulations are similar to our experimentally observed scenario described at Fig. 2f to a considerable extent. Again, while using only (A + IN) injection, the maximum product forming zone remains same irrespective of the concentration and no concentration effect over spatiotemporal variation was observed (Supplementary Fig. 47).

At this point, we asked ourselves, in the development of LIDA type system, what is the benefit of including ProA to A conversion and higher diffusion co-efficient of ProA compared to IN? In fact, one might think that this system could be developed using a faster diffusing A and slower diffusing IN. We tested this by simulating the A + IN system, assuming DA to be greater than DIN. The model simulated conditions when DIN:DA = 1:40, 2:40, 5:40 and 8:40 at kIN/kA = 1, 103 and 106, with the amount of A and IN being 50 mM and 5 mM respectively (fixed DA = 4 × 10−10 m2/s) (Supplementary Figs. 48–59). The resulting plot of P concentration over time shows that P formation was concentrated in the central zone, near the injection point at all diffusion coefficient ratios at kIN/kA = 1. At kIN/kA = 103, maximum concentration of P was found at zone 3 at all ratios of DIN:DA. P formation in the case of kIN/kA = 106 was maximum at distal zones (zone 5, 6), although the maximum concentration of P was lowest here, out of the three kIN/kA cases tested (Supplementary Fig. 60). With faster diffusion of IN, the zone where maximum P is observed moves further away from the site of injection. And higher kIN/kA value shows stronger inhibition in the central zones. Although LIDA can be observed in this case, the addition of ProA to A reaction gives greater spatiotemporal control over the system, even after considering ProA converted A has similar diffusivity to IN. To prove this, we compared these results with the earlier case of ProA + IN at various ratios of diffusion coefficients and kIN/kA (Supplementary Fig. 61). While the concentration of P is lower in the case of ProA + IN, the zone of maximum P formation is consistently farther away than the case with A + IN at least by 1 mm in each case. This is applicable at all ratios of diffusion coefficients and kIN/kA. We also compared P output pattern for two different situations, DProA: DIN: DA = 40:2:5 and 40:2:20 with DIN: DA = 2:5 and 2:20 cases (Supplementary Fig. 62). Here we found that addition of ProA results shifting of maximum P formation zone by 1–2 mm distance compared to A + IN case with different spatiotemporal manner. Overall, the results show the LIDA effect is even more effective while using ProA and its conversion to A during diffusion, even when A has higher diffusivity than IN.

One other advantage of having ProA is that temporal control can be achieved by modifying the reaction parameters of ProA to A. We simulated cases where we modified the kcat/kM ratio to increase or decrease by 10- and 100-fold (at a range of five orders of magnitudes from 30 to 300000 mM−1s−1) (Supplementary Figs. 63–68). The point of time when the desired concentration of P is observed in the system is tracked. The results show that temporal control of this RD system can be achieved by modifying reaction kinetics of ProA to A reaction. This temporal control would not be possible in a simple system with only two diffusing species as shown in A + IN case and therefore, validating the necessity of reaction-diffusion for more distinct LIDA with manifold spatiotemporal diversity.

So far, we have not considered the pH sensitivity of urease reactivity. Urease activity followed a bell-shaped curve where at pH 7 enzyme showed its highest activity. In our experiment, we found that the initial zones remain acidic due to presence of ATP, whereas outer zone has higher pH (data demonstrated in Fig. 3). Indeed, upon measuring ammonia production rate during urease-urea reaction, we also found that with increasing ATP concentration urease reactivity decreased (Supplementary Table S3). Here pH of the system is also decreasing with increasing ATP.

For modeling pH-dependent urease activity, a Gaussian curve centered at pH 7 (enzyme's optimal pH) was used as previously shown by Straube et al.64. The experimentally measured pH values at each of the 8 zones over time are associated with the equivalent radial zones of the model at the specified time points (Supplementary Table 3). Zone 0, representing the central cavity is assigned a pH value of 3.7 to represent its acidic nature due to presence of 5 mM ATP. For each zone, the pH data is interpolated over the experimental time range using the ‘interp1d' function of Python, so that the local pH can be looked up at any simulation moment for each radial position.

The pH in each zone determines the enzyme activity factor (activity_factor variable in code ProA+I – with pH dependence.py), a scalar between 0 and 1. This value then multiplies the catalytic reaction term (reaction_AB variable in the code) in the model equations, thus controlling how efficiently the substrate is converted into the product based on the local pH. Therefore, this model accurately captures the spatial and temporal progression of the reaction system, considering the effect of pH on urease activity. In this case we also considered diffusion of P which is similar to IN and A (DProA: DIN: DA: DP = 40: 2: 2: 2). The simulation result is given in Supplementary Fig. 69. In this case also a clear LIDA effect was observed for ProA + IN case compared to A + IN injected scenario with a factor of 1–2 mm.

In summary, firstly, we experimentally demonstrated a complex chemoenzymatic system to gain control over catalysis at a spatially distant zone in a time-dependent manner. This reaction-diffusion system primarily relied on supramolecular interaction-based diffusion control and both enzymatic and nanoparticle surface-mediated catalysis. This demonstration will be important in the future development of chemical systems that aim to regulate the onset of chemical reactions both spatially and temporally65,66,67,68,69,70. Notably, our approach is entirely different for modulating chemical reactions at the far-off site from the injection point. We also designed a theoretical model to rationalize the experimental facts. We further analyzed the benefits of injecting (dormant activator + inhibitor) together rather than (activator + inhibitor) both in terms of gaining efficient spatial gating of the reaction activation zone from the injection center and temporal control via tuning the enzymatic rate of conversion of activator from dormant activator during diffusion. Overall, pH enhancement and corresponding reaction activation region in the gel matrix can be spatiotemporally gated by the enzymatic conversion rate of ProA to A and initial source concentration of ProA and IN. We believe both experimental and theoretical data presented in this manuscript will be important for the advancement of synthetic reaction-diffusion systems to achieve spatiotemporally diverse chemical signaling pathways via modulating chemical inputs, their interaction parameters and directions of reaction propagation ability with surrounding environmental precursors (for example in presence of ions)71,72,73. One can also envision the utility of this approach from the triggering of spatially distant self-assembly and positional information based chemical events akin to artificial developmental program for the construction of more complex chemical neural networks47,74.

All commercially available reagents were procured and used without any further purification. Ascorbic acid, Bromothymol Blue, Cetyltrimethylammonium Bromide, Sodium Borohydride, Urea, and Urease (UR) were purchased from Sisco Research Laboratory (SRL), India. Adenosine Triphosphate Disodium Salt, Gold (III) Chloride (HAuCl4.3H2O), 1,2-Benzisoxazole, and Sephadex G-25 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Agarose powder was purchased from Himedia.

For performing the Kemp Elimination reaction, the substrate 5-nitrobenzisoxazole (NBI) was synthesized by nitration of 1,2-benzisoxazole and its product 2-cyano-4-nitrophenol (CNP) was synthesized by base hydrolysis of NBI by following the previously reported procedure as discussed below58,75.

NBI synthesis: 0.4 g of 1,2-Benzisoxazole was dissolved in 5 ml concentrated H2SO4 at room temperature. After slowly adding 0.5 ml of a mixture of conc. HNO3 (0.5 ml) and conc. H2SO4 (0.2 ml) to the above solution, it was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was then slowly poured into a 20 ml ice-water mixture, followed by stirring for 10 min. The white precipitate obtained was filtered, washed with cold ethanol and the solvent was dried under a high vacuum. The product was recrystallized in absolute ethanol and a white, crystalline solid was obtained. Yield: 80%.

CNP synthesis: 3 ml of 2 M NaOH were added to a solution containing 0.1 g of 5-nitrobenzisoxazole in 2 ml ethanol and 1 ml water, and the mixture was left to stand for 10 min. Then in order to raise the mixture's pH to 1, HCl was gradually added. Dichloromethane was used to extract the solution, and a vacuum was used to evaporate the solvent. A bright yellow solid was obtained by air-drying the product. Yield: 70%.

For calculating CNP concentration, in aqueous solution after UV-vis kinetics, molar extinction co-efficient value of 16,000 M−1cm−1 was considered57,58.

Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) were synthesized using the seed growth method as described in previously reported literature56. Briefly, 3.75 ml of 100 mM CTAB solution was mixed with 0.052 ml of 24 mM HAuCl4.4H2O to create a seed solution. This was followed by the addition of 1.2 ml of freshly made 25 mM ice-cold sodium borohydride solution, which produced a brown solution that showed the development of gold seeds. For the growth solution, 6.25 ml of 4.0 mM HAuCl4.4H2O solution was mixed with 10 ml of 100 mM CTAB solution. Next, 7.5 ml of 100 mM L-ascorbic acid was added, and the mixture was gently shaken until it became colorless. After adding 62.5 µl of seed solution to the growth solution and vigorously stirring for 20 s, the creation of gold nanoparticles is indicated by the appearance of red. Finally, the resulting solution was left alone for 24 h at room temperature. For further purification it was then passed through a Sephadex G-25 column, containing 0.5 g of Sephadex G-25 swelled in Milli-Q water.

Hydrodynamic diameters (Dh) and zeta potentials of the GNP were measured using Horiba Scientific NanoParticle Observer (SZ-100V2).

Urease activity was measured experimentally using the salicylate-hypochlorite method as discussed in earlier literature76. For the urea-urease (UU) reaction, 50 mM urea and 15 nM of urease were used. 20 µl of UU reaction solution at different time points (t = 0, 5, 10 and 15 min) was added to sodium salicylate, sodium hypochlorite and trisodium phosphate with the final concentration of 250 mM, 50 mM and 100 mM respectively in a sequential manner. The final volume of the solution was 500 µl. This solution was heated at 50 °C for 1 hour after which the spectrum was recorded. A calibration curve was made by plotting absorbance at 640 nm against concentration (50, 100, 250, 500, 750 and 1000 µM) of ammonium bicarbonate as standard. From this plot, the concentration of the ammonia product from UU reaction was determined. Please see Supplementary Table 3 for the data.

The theoretical simulations were modeled using ‘solve_ivp' function of SciPy library in Python. The detailed equations are given in the supplementary information. The Github link for codes used to perform the simulation has been mentioned in ‘code availability' section.

For modeling pH-dependent urease activity, a Gaussian curve centered at pH 7 (enzyme's optimal pH) was used as previously shown by Straube et al.64.

22.5 mg agarose powder was dissolved in 3 ml of milliQ water by heating at 110 °C in a heating block. Then, the dissolved agarose gel was poured into a petri dish with a diameter of 35 mm by placing a cylindrical tube with a diameter of 5 mm at the center of the petri dish and was allowed to cool down at room temperature. This allowed the dissolved agarose powder to polymerize into a rigid yet porous hydrogel matrix. For preparing the GNP amalgamated agarose hydrogel, GNP was added to the dissolved agarose solution (by cooling it to around 55 °C) before pouring it into the petri dish. Hydrogels containing GNP + NBI, GNP + NBI + UR, GNP + BTB, GNP + BTB + UR, NBI + UR, and BTB + UR were synthesized following a similar procedure by keeping the final concentrations of GNP, NBI, UR, and BTB at 200 pM, 0.5 mM, 15 nM, and 30 µM, respectively.

To measure the Kemp elimination reaction and pH change in different zones in the hydrogel, the as-prepared hydrogel was placed inside a PolarStar Omega plate reader. Then, a 40 µl volume of ProA (urea), IN (ATP), or a mixture of IN + ProA (in different ratios), or a mixture of IN + A was added into the hole at the center of the agarose gel, and absorbance values at various zones of hydrogel were recorded at different interval of time. For the Kemp elimination reaction, absorbance values were recorded at 380 nm wavelength, whereas for pH change, absorbance values were recorded at 620 nm with matrix scanning (well scanning) mode, keeping the scan matrix dimension 23 × 23, scan width 23 mm. Then, for convenience, four points from each zone (highlighted with red color in Fig. 2b) were taken as the average value for the respective zone. All the experiments were performed twice, and the average value of 2 measurements for each zone was plotted in circular form as shown in Fig. 2a of the main manuscript. Here, each zone is separated by 1 mm, and the outermost 1 mm was excluded to avoid the boundary effect. All the experimental data are averages of 3 experiments. The absorbance value coming from only gel without CNP was subtracted in each case. For converting absorbance to CNP concentration, a calibration plot with known CNP-containing agarose gel (embedded with GNP and urease) was conducted (Supplementary Fig. 70). For pH determination, the calibration curve given at Supplementary Fig. 16 was used. Two independent experiments were performed in each case. Therefore, 8 datapoints were used to calculate the average KE product formation or pH value.

For theoretical data, the concentration of product was normalized with respect to the maximum product concentration obtained for the case of kIN/kA = 103 and DProA:DIN:DA = 40:2:2 at 150 min in the entire manuscript including supplementary information (Fig. 4c).

Stereodivergent construction of multiple stereocentres is one of the most essential tasks in asymmetric synthesis. However, strategies for assembling all possible stereoisomers of optically active compounds bearing non-adjacent stereocentres remain scarce and suffer from certain limitations in terms of reaction types and chemical space. Here we succeed in utilizing the chain walking strategy to realize the simultaneous construction of acyclic 1,n-non-adjacent (n = 3 or 4) stereocentres via Ni-catalysed migratory hydroalkylation of trisubstituted alkenes in an enantioselective and diastereodivergent manner. A series of alkyl units can be site-selectively installed at α-C(sp3)–H sites adjacent to nitrogen, affording chiral amines bearing an α-stereogenic centre and a remote (γ- or δ-) all-alkyl-substituted stereocentre. All four stereoisomers can be accessed using a single catalyst via an appropriate selection of the olefin geometry and ligand configuration, with exceptional control of stereochemistry. This simple and mild platform offers opportunities for the streamlined synthesis of complex bioactive molecules and medicinally relevant scaffolds.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Waymo's Robotaxis Can Now Use the Highway, Speeding Up Longer Trips","https://www.wired.com/story/waymo-robotaxis-can-now-take-highways-freeways/","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

When Google's self-driving car project began testing in the Bay Area back in 2009, its engineers focused on highways by sending its sensor-laden vehicles cruising down Interstate 280, which runs the length of Silicon Valley's peninsula.

More than 15 years later, the cars are back on the freeway—this time without drivers. On Tuesday, the project, now an Alphabet subsidiary we all know as Waymo, announced that its robotaxi service would now drive on freeways in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and Phoenix.

The new service marks another technical leap for Waymo, whose robotaxis currently serve five US metros: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area. The company says it will launch in several other US and international cities next year, including Dallas, Miami, Nashville, Las Vegas, Detroit, and London.

Waymo also announced Wednesday that it would begin curbside pickup and drop-off service at San Jose Mineta International Airport, allowing passengers to, theoretically, travel autonomously all the way from San Francisco to San Jose—a service area of some 260 square miles. Waymo has been offering its autonomous taxi service on area service roads since the summer of 2023, but the new freeway service could cut in half the time it takes for a robotaxi to travel from San Francisco to Mountain View, Waymo user experience researcher Naomi Guthrie says.

“Freeway driving is one of those things that's very easy to learn, but very hard to master,” Waymo co-CEO Dmitri Dolgov told reporters last week. Highways are predictable, with (mostly) clear signs and lane lines, and a limited set of vehicles and players (trucks, cars, motorcycles, trailers) that a vehicle's software must learn to recognize and predict. But Waymo executives said that, despite a year of employee- and guest-only highway testing, safety emergencies on highways are relatively rare, so the team was unable to collect as much real-world data as it needed to train its vehicles to operate safely there. Complicating the project was the fact that highway crashes, at high speeds, are subject to the laws of phsyics—and so more likely to maim or kill.

To get ready for highways, Waymo executives say, engineers supplemented real-world driving data and training with data collected on private, closed courses, and data created in simulations. Two onboard computers help create system “redundancies,” meaning the vehicles will have computer backup if something goes wrong. The vehicles have been trained to exit highways in the case of emergencies, but will be able to pull over as well. Waymo execs also say they have and will work with law enforcement and first responders, including highway patrols, to create procedures for vehicles and riders stranded on highway shoulders, where hundreds of Americans are killed every year.

The new service area, in blue, in the San Francisco Bay Area.

At launch, Waymo freeway trips will only occur on limited portions of certain highways: US Route 60, Interstates 10 and 17, and Loop 202 in Phoenix; US Route 101, Interstates 80, 280, and 380, and State Routes 85, 92, and 237 in the Bay Area; and Interstates 5, 10, 105, 110, and 405, and State Routes 2, 60, 90, and 187 in LA County. For now, freeway trips will only be accessible to Waymo riders who opt in to freeway driving within the app; gradually, they will be rolled out to all riders, the company says.

Microsoft says it has linked massive data centers in Wisconsin and Atlanta — roughly 700 miles and five states apart — through a high-speed fiber-optic network to operate as a unified system.

The announcement Wednesday morning marks the debut of what the company is calling its AI “superfactory,” a new class of data centers built specifically for artificial intelligence. The facilities are designed to train and run advanced AI models across connected sites — a setup that Microsoft describes as the world's first “planet-scale AI superfactory.”

Unlike traditional cloud data centers that run millions of separate applications for different customers, Microsoft says the new facilities are designed to handle single, massive AI workloads across multiple sites. Each data center houses hundreds of thousands of Nvidia GPUs connected through a high-speed architecture known as an AI Wide Area Network, or AI-WAN, to share computing tasks in real time.

Microsoft says it's using a new two-story data center design to pack GPUs more densely and minimize latency, a strategy enabled in part by a closed-loop liquid cooling system.

By linking sites across regions, the company says it's able to pool computing capacity, redirect workloads dynamically, and distribute the massive power requirements across the grid so that it isn't dependent on available energy resources in one part of the country.

This unified supercomputer will train and run the next generation of AI models for key partners such as OpenAI, and for Microsoft's own internal models.

The new approach shows the rapid pace of the AI infrastructure race among the world's largest tech companies. Microsoft spent more than $34 billion on capital expenditures in its most recent quarter — much of it on data centers and GPUs — to keep up with what it sees as soaring AI demand.

Amazon is taking a similar approach with its new Project Rainier complex in Indiana, a cluster of seven data center buildings spanning more than 1,200 acres. Meta, Google, OpenAI and Anthropic are making similar multibillion-dollar bets, collectively putting hundreds of billions into new facilities, chips, and systems to train and deploy AI models.

Some analysts and investors see echoes of a tech bubble in the rush to build AI infrastructure, if business customers don't realize enough value from AI in the near term. Microsoft, Amazon and others say the demand is real, not speculative, pointing to long-term contracts as evidence.

Story corrected at 11:30 a.m. PT to accurately reflect Microsoft's announcements about which companies will have AI models trained in the facilities.

In a surprise Wednesday drop, Bellevue, Wash.-based Valve Software unveiled three new physical gaming devices intended to work with its digital storefront Steam.

Planned for release in early 2026, the devices are described as new parts of the “Steam Hardware family.” They include the Steam Machine, a small console intended for users' living rooms; the Steam Frame, a lightweight VR headset; and a new Steam Controller, which features several new interfaces similar to those found on Valve's Steam Deck.

“We've been super happy with the success of Steam Deck, and PC gamers have continued asking for even more ways to play all the great titles in their Steam libraries,” Gabe Newell, president of Valve, said in a press release.

“Our work over the years on other hardware and even more importantly on SteamOS has enabled Steam Controller, Steam Machine, and Steam Frame to do just that,” Newell said.

The Steam Machine is a 6-inch cube that's designed to fit unobtrusively into a living room or entertainment center. It's intended to quietly and efficiently run games from your Steam library, with a removable front panel for decorative purposes and an LED so users can readily tell when it's on or off.

Like the Steam Deck, the Steam Machine runs on a Linux-based operating system that's built around Steam. If plugged into a monitor and keyboard, it can be used as a standalone PC with a KDE Plasma desktop environment.

The Steam Frame is a standalone virtual reality headset that's reportedly able to stream any game from users' Steam library, with full controller input. It's a PC in its own right, so it can be used by itself, rather than having to be hooked up to a desktop.

Finally, the Steam Controller “shares DNA” with the Steam Deck, and is described by Valve as “high-performance” and “ergonomic,” with magnetic thumbsticks, trackpads, a gyroscope, and buttons on the grips. In addition to being designed for the Steam Machine, the Steam Controller is compatible with PCs and laptops.

Valve's announcement on Wednesday came roughly 10 minutes after a series of rumors and leaks that went viral in the PC gaming community, apparently spurred by an accidental release by one of Valve's partner companies.

No announcements were made regarding exact release dates or prices for any of the devices, but Valve did state it hopes to share those details after the first of the year.

This is a full-circle move for Valve, which had previously attempted to break into both the controller and living room markets with similar devices. Previous editions of both the Steam Controller and Steam Machine were released in 2015 and discontinued in 2019. Valve still sells its high-end Valve Index VR system, which first came out in 2019, though it's out of stock at time of writing.

This is a seemingly strange time for Valve to revisit its hardware divisions, but the Steam Deck's success seems to have reignited its ambition to reshape the face of PC gaming. Newell has been vocal for years about how he believes Windows is a poor environment for computer games, and Valve has made a number of moves in recent memory that all come back to trying to expand Linux's presence in the scene. Through that lens, the new 2026 Steam Machine in particular seems like another quiet shot across Microsoft's bow.

Search and rescues missions often happen in areas that are difficult for humans to navigate due to extreme weather, rough terrain, or dangerous conditions like smoke or dust.

A researcher at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) wants to send robots inspired by bats on these missions instead of humans.

Nitin J. Sanket, a professor at WPI, has developed small flying robots with his team that fit in the palm of a hand and use ultrasound — just like bats. These robots use AI-powered software to filter out noise from the ultrasound signals the devices collect, allowing them to spot obstacles within a two-meter radius.

“Search and rescue is done on foot,” Sanket told TechCrunch. “There are a lot of people who go on foot with flashlights in really harsh conditions and put their lives at danger to save others. We thought drones are the answer because they can cover a lot of ground really fast. They can be agile and quick.”

Sanket has long been fascinated by aerial robots and drones and how the tech can be retrofitted for real-world situations. During his PhD program, his advisor challenged him to create the smallest robot possible, which sparked his research into taking cues from biology to build smaller machines.

“We had to reimagine what a drone would be at that point, which is go back to biology, because biology does this way better than we can today,” Sanket said. “How do insects or birds do it with super limited compute and not-so-good sensing apparatus? Their eyes are not that great, their brains are really small, but they're still able to do these amazing feats of flight. So we started looking at that, and that's what gave rise to my PhD thesis.”

Sanket built a prototype of a robotic beehive made up of small drones that could pollinate flowers. Despite his efforts, he realized that this application was probably a moonshot and started thinking of areas where biology-based robots could make a difference sooner, which led him to his current project.

For the search and rescue robots, the main challenge was building something with the necessary sensors and flying technology without making the robot too large, expensive, or energy intensive.

Sanket said they turned to the ultrasound sensors used in automatic faucets because they require very little power. While that approach worked, the propellers they built on the robots created too much noise, which overloaded the sensor's ability to spot obstacles.

To fix this problem, they turned back to bats.

“Bats have these special tissues in their nose, ears, and mouth which adaptively change in thickness and density to modulate the way they hear and chirp sound,” Sanket said. “We were like, ‘Okay, that's super cool.' Can we do something like that? We designed a 3D-printed structure to place in front of the robot, which essentially does the same [functionally, as] what a bat does, which is change the shape of the sound itself.”

Now that they've been able to get the robots to work, they are working to tackle their next challenge: improving their speed.

“We, as human beings, like to try to mimic a lot of things the human brain does,” Sanket said. “We tend to forget how remarkable other animals are, which are much smaller than us. Especially insects and birds, which are much tinier, can actually do remarkable feats of navigation, which I think we don't really see often. I think we should think more as scientists rather than just pure engineers.”

Crafting a perfect prompt for AI chatbots is often a challenge —  so much so that startups are creating roles for prompt engineers. Consumer-facing AI apps are increasingly adding features like suggestion buttons or autogenerated recommendations to nudge customers to use the chatbot more frequently and show them about what the app can do.

Hero, a productivity startup founded by former Meta employees, announced a new autocompletion SDK today that will fill in prompts for you based on context. The SDK is currently invite-only and will let developers integrate this tech into their apps.

Here is how it works: When you are booking a flight, you might write “Book a flight” in the prompt. The autocomplete SDK will start populating fields like “to,” “from,””on date,” “at time,” “airline,” and “returning on.” You can stop at any point and send the query to the chatbot.

This is also useful when you are using an AI-powered image or a video generator, where autocomplete can help you with different parameters like object, style, location, landscape, and camera angle. Notably, Adobe's new feature for creating soundtracks with its Firefly app lets user enter keywords in different sections of a prompt, such as mood, style, and purpose, to easily create a tune.

Hero engineer Saharsh Vedi, who worked on this feature, said that usually you usually need a lot of back-and-forth with an AI app to get the results you want. With this autocomplete feature, you can get there with fewer prompts — or even just one.

The startup's co-founder, Brad Kowalk, told TechCrunch that the company is using a series of models to predict what you might type into a prompt next.

“With AI autocomplete, we pull forward all the inputs needed to complete an action, finishing it 10 times faster as there are fewer back-and-forths involved. This unlocks a whole new set of use cases ranging from travel to commerce, and ads to customer support,” Kowalk said.

He added that because there are fewer messages involved, companies operating at scale can save on server costs.

Kowalk said that he and his co-founder, Seung W. Lee, thought of building the tech based on their experience working on AR features at Meta. On AR glasses, there are constraints on screen size, so the interface for prompts needs to be simple — like adding parameters to a query.

The startup, which raised $4 million in seed funding last year, has secured $3 million in additional funding led by Forerunner Ventures. Kowalk said that in the coming months, depending on the app and SDK growth, Hero plans to raise a bigger round.

Hero is testing a version of this technology in its app that helps users find time for a meeting or to catch up with a friend through autocomplete prompts. The feature will be released to users in a couple of months.

The company is also in talks with Koah Labs, an ad tech startup, to build AI-powered ads where brands can show up in autocomplete suggestions.

Blue Origin has again postponed the second launch of its New Glenn megarocket. This time, it wasn't bad weather or a wayward cruise ship that got in the way—it was an ongoing severe geomagnetic storm.

Last night, the arrival of two coronal mass ejections—huge eruptions of plasma and magnetic field from the Sun's surface—triggered dazzling auroras as far south as Alabama. NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) issued a G4—or “severe”—geomagnetic storm watch through Wednesday, as another larger CME is expected to reach Earth around midday.

New Glenn was set to lift off no earlier than 2:50 p.m. ET from Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, according to NASA's Kennedy Space Center. It's worth noting that the Federal Aviation Administration recently issued a ground stop on daytime commercial space launches during the government shutdown, but Blue Origin received an exemption for this launch.

Due to the risks associated with launching during a severe geomagnetic storm, Blue Origin opted to postpone the event until space weather conditions clear up, according to a company statement posted on X just before 10 a.m. ET.  The statement did not specify a new launch date.

NG-2 Update: New Glenn is ready to launch. However, due to highly elevated solar activity and its potential effects on the ESCAPADE spacecraft, NASA is postponing launch until space weather conditions improve. We are currently assessing opportunities to establish our next launch…

— Blue Origin (@blueorigin) November 12, 2025



Geomagnetic storms are major disturbances in Earth's magnetosphere that typically occur when the Sun blasts a CME toward our planet. These disturbances can increase the likelihood of aurora at latitudes farther south. They can also disrupt power systems, radio communications, and spacecraft operations.

According to the SWPC, Wednesday's geomagnetic storm could impact some critical infrastructure, “but mitigation is possible.” Had Blue Origin moved forward with the launch, solar weather could have messed with the communications and navigation systems that New Glenn relies on. Geomagnetic storms also heat the upper atmosphere, which can increase drag and alter ascent conditions.

It's easy to understand why the company chose to postpone. Both Blue Origin and NASA have a lot riding on this launch, so New Glenn won't get off the ground until conditions are just right.

This is only the second test flight for Blue Origin's megarocket. After significant delays, Jeff Bezos' company is under pressure to demonstrate New Glenn's ability to serve as a deep-space launch provider. To that end, the rocket will launch NASA's twin ESCAPADE probes on a journey to Mars during this test flight.

The $80 million NASA mission raises the stakes for New Glenn. ESCAPADE (the Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers mission) will use two identical spacecraft to investigate how solar wind interacts with Mars' magnetic environment and how this drives the planet's atmospheric escape, according to NASA.

It's the agency's first mission to Mars since the Perseverance rover launched in 2020, and it's the first-ever multi-spacecraft orbital science mission to the Red Planet.

Needless to say, Blue Origin needs this next launch to go well. New Glenn's success would make it a strong competitor for both NASA science missions and national security contracts. Here's hoping space weather conditions clear up soon.

Valve is promising 4K gaming at 60 FPS with FSR

Valve rattled the gaming industry in 2022 with the launch of the Steam Deck, letting you take your PC games anywhere with an easy-to-use operating system. Now, the company is taking its learnings from that device and bringing them to your living room in a new gaming PC, the Steam Machine.

Tom's Hardware visited Valve's offices in Bellevue, Washington to talk to the developers behind this new PC and get an early look at the hardware.

This is a system meant for living room play, armed with a new semi-custom AMD Zen 4 CPU and AMD RDNA 3 GPU, and it runs SteamOS just like the Steam Deck. In many ways, it's effectively a Steam-based console. Valve claims that this system is six times more powerful than the Steam Deck, though, so it should be a better couch experience than using the Steam Deck Dock and playing games at low resolution. The company suggests that the Steam Machine can play games in 4K and 60 frames per second, with the caveat that you'll have to rely on AMD's FSR upscaling.

The PC measures 6.39 x 6.14 x 5.98 inches — almost a cube (without the computer's feet, it's 5.83 inches tall). Most of the computer is on the bottom of the box, with the majority of the space inside taken up by a substantial heatsink and fan. The front of the system features a customizable light bar that you can personalize to indicate system status, such as when it is booting up, downloading games, or updating.

CPU

AMD 6-core Zen 4 x86, up to 4.8 GHz, 30W TDP

GPU

Semi-custom AMD RDNA3 28CU (8GB GDDR6, 2.45GHz max sustained clock, 110W TDP)

RAM

16GB DDR5 SO-DIMMs

Storage

512GB or 2TB models, microSD card slot

sPower Supply

300 W, internal

Dimensions (D x W x H)

6.39 x 6.14 x 5.98 inches  / 162.4 x 156 x 152 mm

Ports

DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.0, Ethernet (1Gbps), USB Type-C 3.2 Gen 2, 2x USB Type-A Gen 3 (front), 2x USB Type-A Gen 2 (rear)

Connectivity

""It's mostly a heatsink, because we know that the living room environment is very challenging from a thermal standpoint, from an air flow standpoint,"" a Valve developer told Tom's Hardware. ""So, to sort of make it as quiet as possible and as cool as possible, this is where we need to be.""

The heatsink is truly massive. With the top and sides removed, the Steam Machine looks similar to a denser version of Noctua's NH-P1 air cooler, with similar dimensions and denser fins, and a couple of heatpipes poking out of the edges. Hopefully, it proves nearly as quiet as that fanless cooler.

 




The front of the Steam Machine is magnetic, which is designed for easy cleaning. The default is black, but Valve reps said the company will be releasing files for people with 3D printers to come up with their own designs. At their headquarters, Steam had a few custom options it designed, including a very classy woodgrain look and a Team Fortress 2 design.

There was also an e-ink front that displayed system stats in real-time, but it wasn't working when we were in the demo room. Regardless, the company said it doesn't have plans to sell any designs other than the plain front. So if you want something other than basic black, be prepared to make your own.

The Steam Machine's CPU is based on 6 AMD Zen 4 cores, runs up to 4.8 GHz, and has a 30W TDP. The GPU uses AMD's RDNA 3 cores and features 28 compute units, 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM, and a 2.45 GHz max sustained clock.

The processor and GPU are two distinct chips on the same motherboard, which Valve says allows for the best-size device, along with the best thermal performance. Valve did explore a separate add-in board GPU at one point, but we were told that ""the compromises that we have to make on size and thermals and cost didn't really pan out.""

The CPU is paired with 16GB of DDR5. And while the company is using traditional SODIMMs, it's a bit more complicated to reach them with the heatsink in the way. Technically, you can upgrade it, but with some RF shielding and an attempt to keep the memory as close as possible to the CPU for signal integrity, it might be a bit of work.

There's an integrated 300W power supply. Valve says the GPU uses 110W (though one Valve rep gave a range of 110W - 130W, stating that ""we're still kind of fine-tuning that"") while the CPU goes up to 30 watts. The CPU peaks at 4.8 GHz.

Valve will sell two configurations of the Steam Machine, and the only difference will be storage. You can get either a 512GB SSD or a 2TB SSD. Either way, Valve is using an M.2 2230 SSD in the system, though there is room to support an M.2 2280 if you decide to upgrade or replace the drive.

There is another way to expand storage. Just like on the Steam Deck, you can use a microSD card. If you remove the microSD card and place it in a Steam Deck or a Stream Frame, your library will come with you, ready to go in other devices.

""For most people, you never have to be seeing [the SSD] at all,"" said Valve hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat. ""[An] SD card is your best way to expand your storage, but if you really want to, you can. It's your device.""

In addition, there are distinct Wi-Fi and Bluetooth antennas to help prevent signal issues. If you're using Valve's new Steam Controller, a connection puck is built into the device, allowing for up to four Steam Controllers with no loss in Bluetooth performance. (You are, of course, welcome to connect a mouse and keyboard or use other controllers).

The system supports two displays via HDMI and DisplayPort on the rear. If you add a DisplayPort hub to the rear or use daisy-chaining, the system should be able to support more monitors. While Valve says the HDMI port supports 4K at 60 Hz, it's labeled as HDMI 2.0, not HDMI 2.1, because it doesn't currently use some software features of HDMI 2.1, such as like DSC and ALLM, which Valve says ""we are currently working on and hope to rectify in the future.""

With the new computer, Valve also has a new controller, the Steam Controller. This will be sold in an optional bundle with the Steam Machine, as well as on its own. Beyond the Steam Machine, the Controller works with anything that runs Steam, including Windows, Mac and Linux PCs, PC gaming handhelds, the Steam Frame, and Steam Deck. If you use Steam Link, iOS and Android devices should work, too.

The controller features two joysticks, ABXY buttons, and a D-Pad in a layout similar to PlayStation's DualSense controller, in that the joysticks are parallel. The extra buttons, including Steam, menu, view, and quick access menu buttons, are also there, along with two trackpads for haptic feedback. The touchpads are on a slight angle up — it's not drastic — and are tilted slightly sideways to address the way your thumbs meet to move them.

""They're clocked and canted, and that is just because based on a ton of experimentation, and probably 30 different orientations of these trackpads, we found that this angle is the most comfortable for the most users when they're playing,"" Valve's Steve Cardinali said.

The joysticks are using TMR (Tunneling Magnetoresistance) joysticks, which should help reduce stick drift. Valve also said that because these joysticks are so responsive, it could reduce the deadzone on the controllers by more than half.

There are also standard L/R triggers and L/R bumpers, along with four assignable grip buttons, just like on the Steam Deck. Effectively, this whole controller is the Steam Deck controls in a console-style controller.

The other inputs, though, are more unique. There's a 6-axis gyroscope and what Valve calls ""Capacitive grip sense,"" which means the controller can tell that you're holding it. We demoed the Controller in Balatro, lifting fingers off of the controller to activate the gyroscope, making moves, and then placing our fingers back down.

There are four motors in the controller: two in the grips and another two specifically for the trackpads.

You can connect the Steam Controller to devices in three different ways. The primary option is the Steam Controller Puck, which comes pre-paired with the controller. (If you're using a Steam Machine, there's an internal puck inside). The Puck, which plugs into a USB port, uses a proprietary wireless connection that Valve claims is more stable than Bluetooth, and can connect to four controllers. Of course, standard Bluetooth is also an option, as is directly attaching to a computer with a USB cable.

 




The Steam Controller Puck can also charge the controller. There are pogo pins on the puck that you can connect to the Controller in order to charge it when you're not playing games. You can also charge the device over USB.

Valve estimates that you'll get 35 hours or more of playtime on the Steam Controller's rechargeable battery.

Tom's Hardware Managing editor Matt Safford said that the controller felt comfortable in his brief demo time, though he spent more time cycling through the various modes than settling on a specific one. Quickly using the gyroscope to move the cursor after removing a couple of fingers from the grip did instantly feel intuitive. More time, he said, will tell how he feels about the touchpads, given his muscle memory and proclivity for the FPS genre is based on a keyboard and mouse.

The controller didn't feel overly bulky, nor heavy or light. The plastic used in the construction generally felt fine, neither overly cheap or particularly premium. It feels similar to a Steam Deck.

Valve hasn't provided pricing or an exact release date for the Steam Machine or Steam Controller just yet, though we were told to expect the hardware early next year. Some of that uncertainty is because of a volatile market for computer components.

""The market is kind of weird right now,"" a Valve rep told us. ""You know, memory prices are going up like right as we speak. Right now, depending on who you ask, they might tell you the GDDR we're using is not a thing next year, right? So, like, there's a lot of things that we're still trying to figure it out. But, uh, of course, our goal is to be ready, and we think we're doing a pretty good job of that.”

That being said, we were told that the company is aiming for a ""great value"" on ""the entry level side of things."" But Valve's developers also mentioned that the Steam Machine, being packed with features, makes pricing a bit of a ""balancing act"" in an attempt to find a sweet spot. But we won't find out pricing until closer to launch.

The Steam Machine moniker does come with some baggage. That was also the name of a series of small desktop computers released in 2015 running on a previous version of the Linux-based SteamOS. At the time, SteamOS only ran games that worked natively on Linux. And the Steam Machines, which were made by companies like Alienware, Zotac, and Origin, didn't perform as well as Windows-based competitors with similar hardware. At the time, Valve chose not to make its own computer, though it did make a controller.

That controller, also dubbed the Steam Controller, featured a single touchpad in lieu of the right control stick. While some praised it for its flexibility across game genres, the controller eventually went on a firesale in 2019, with Valve selling them at $5 a pop to clear inventory.

Valve's hardware developers told us they've learned from the original Steam Machines, and that they don't want game developers to have to do work to get their games working for the device unless it's additive to take advantage of SteamOS or Steam Machine features.

With newer hardware, better game compatibility, and the Steam Deck as a strong proof of concept, it sure seems from a brief hands-on that the Steam Machine has a better chance this time around.

Huawei accelerators gain traction as Chinese cloud giants retrain away from Nvidia silicon.

Restrictions on U.S. chip exports are beginning to force visible shifts in China's AI compute strategy, as a shortage of Nvidia accelerators drives cloud providers toward domestic alternatives. According to new reporting by The Wall Street Journal, supply has become tight enough that government officials are now overseeing allocation of remaining high-end parts, prioritizing homegrown options like Huawei's Ascend series for training and inference workloads.

The impact is reportedly most visible in China's public cloud and state-funded data center projects, which are now formally barred from using foreign AI chips. The directive follows earlier efforts by Beijing to promote domestic hardware through subsidies and procurement preference, but the latest guidance is more absolute. Chinese developers are rewriting code and restructuring workloads to run on domestic accelerators like Huawei's Ascend 910B and 910C, as a result, which are less powerful than Nvidia's latest GPUs.

As for the Ascend 910C, it's emerging as a default choice. An updated version of the company's 910B, the 910C combines two 910B dies in one package and reportedly began mass shipments this spring. Multiple Chinese developers are thought to already be using it for model training, making it the first domestic chip deployed at this scale for large-scale AI.

Alibaba and Baidu, two of China's largest cloud providers, have begun shifting workloads to their in-house AI silicon as well. Baidu recently revealed a new version of its Baige training platform that runs entirely on Chinese-made hardware and software, designed to keep its product road map moving without access to the latest Nvidia parts.

Meanwhile, others are trying to work around supply chains. Some Chinese companies have routed training runs through overseas subsidiaries, while others are relying on second-hand or refurbished Nvidia accelerators that predate the latest U.S. rules or procuring chips through grey-market brokers.

With Chinese developers pushing into less mature hardware ecosystems, memory bandwidth is becoming a key constraint. As we reported in September, Chinese memory firms like YMTC and CXMT are exploring HBM production to support domestic accelerators, but no large-scale supply has materialized.

For Nvidia, export restrictions and the growing pivot away from its products in China have eroded its entire share in what was once one of its biggest markets.

Valve doubles down on headset gaming, but it isn't all about VR.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Not quite four years on from the industry-bending success of the Steam Deck, Valve is back with its most ambitious collection of gaming hardware yet. Today, the pioneering PC gaming company is taking the wraps off the Arm-powered wireless Steam Frame gaming headset, a new Steam Controller that takes its design cues from the Steam Deck, and something I never would have guessed, given its past failures: a new compact, cube-shaped Steam Machine gaming desktop, rocking some more semi-custom AMD silicon.

Valve invited us to its headquarters for some early hands-on time with all this new hardware, and I came away mostly impressed. These are big swings for a company that has a tiny number of employees compared to competitors like Epic Games or Microsoft.

But after the huge success of the Steam Deck (and its many pricier copycats), Valve has firmly established itself on the hardware front. Its controller and Linux-powered gaming desktop have a good shot at success if the price is right (Valve isn't talking pricing on any of its new hardware yet).

For those more interested in traditional PC gaming, we're breaking the cube-shaped Steam Machine and new Steam Controller out into its own story [here]. We'll dig into the new headset in detail below, because as much as we love desktops and controllers, the Steam Frame headset is both the most interesting and complex of its new devices, and the one that might be the hardest sell.

 




But the company's secret weapon might be one of its simplest features, which applies to both the Steam Frame headset and the Steam Machine: the ability to pull the microSD card from your Steam Deck and insert it into either of the company's new SteamOS machines and get instant access to your library and saved games. We'll have to see how well that trick works once we get review hardware, but it sounds like a great way to get gamers to further buy into your hardware ecosystem and your game store.

 




The Steam Frame headset, formerly known in leaks as its codename, Deckard, is the real wildcard in Valve's new lineup, as well as the most complex. Aside from, perhaps, Valve's own Half-Life Alyx, compelling, high-production AAA VR games haven't materialized, despite a decade of hardware pushes from Valve, HTC, and most notably Meta.

Valve's solution? The Steam Frame (and its controllers) are designed to play VR titles, as well as traditional PC and mobile games in a resizable in-headset window that actually felt like a big-screen experience during my hands-on time with the headset. Valve engineers told me the company thinks of the Steam Frame less as a VR headset and more as “a new way to play your entire Steam library.” The Frame can do this both by streaming titles wirelessly from your PC, or running them internally on its built-in Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

This is all a major change from Valve's previous headset, the Valve Index. That headset, released in 2019, was purely for VR gaming, used base stations for tracking, and required attaching to a computer to play.

With the Steam Frame, streaming from a PC is one option, but the company has a new “Fex” (Valve stylizes it as FEX) software emulation layer that brings SteamOS to the Arm instruction set, which certainly has implications beyond this device. But I'm very curious how much running Windows titles via Proton and Fex is going to affect battery life and performance.

Valve had to design its Steam Frame controllers to handle traditional games alongside those that involve head and controller tracking. In short, in addition to the thumbsticks and triggers, there's a D-pad to the left controller and ABXY buttons on the right, as well as a second set of finger triggers. This is a major difference from Valve's previous VR controllers for its Index headset, which each included an A button, B button, thumb stick, gyroscope, and advanced finger tracking.

In short demos, this seemed to work fine, but I am not sure I'd want to play something like a platformer or other gamepad-focused title for long periods with a separated D-pad and button setup. That said, lots of Switch players have been doing that for years.

Comfort of a headset is going to vary between individuals, and I didn't spend hours using the Steam Frame, so I'm not ready to fully pass judgment yet. But the headset was fairly easy to put on and adjust the IPD (via a knob between the lenses), it never felt heavy in my demos, and I didn't experience nearly as much lens fogging as I have with previous VR headsets. But the latter might have more to do with the climate control in Valve's offices than the headset itself. Like so many other aspects of the Steam Frame, the fit feels good at first blush, but I'd need to spend a lot more time with it on my head to tell just how good it is.

At the very least, the Steam Frame's 440 gram weight (including the battery, padding, and straps) is less than the 515-gram Meta Quest 3.

 




Valve's engineers emphasized that the company sees the Steam Frame as a “wireless streaming-first device.” So while the headset (specifically, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip it runs on, which was a flagship smartphone processor back in 2024) technically supports Wi-Fi 7, for gaming that's streamed from your desktop or laptop, the company includes a dedicated Wi-Fi 6E dongle with the headset. That dongle uses the 6GHz band for game streaming, while the 5GHz band handles Wi-Fi communication duties, like downloads and multiplayer communication, and chat.

 




To improve streaming further, Valve is also offering up some new (but familiar) streaming tech. Foveated rendering — essentially saving compute resources by using eye tracking to render only the center of what you are looking at in the greatest detail — has been a staple of VR for nearly a decade now. But with the Steam Frame, Valve is taking that concept and applying it to game streaming, calling it Foveated Streaming, and pointing out that this isn't something developers need to get involved with.

""The game just renders the full field of view, like it normally would,” said Valve's Jeremy Selan. “The games don't have to do anything to take advantage of the technology.""

In my brief time playing Half-Life: Alyx on the Steam Frame at Valve's headquarters, performance was flawless, and the controllers were intuitive. But, of course, we need to spend more time with the headset in settings that aren't Valve's HQ to pass judgment on how well the Steam Frame is at streaming titles from a PC.

But that's not the only way the Steam Frame can game. The company also showed off the x86 version of Hades 2 running standalone (as in not streaming from a PC) on the Steam Frame. And the game ran just fine and looked good at what Valve reps told me was 1400p in a window inside the headset, which I could actually resize to something that filled a large part of my field of view.

“The magic trick is that the game doesn't know it's running on an Arm chip,” designer Lawrence Yang told me. The game may be designed for a Windows PC, but “it's actually running on Linux, running on Arm.”

That happens thanks to Valve's Fex, which is an emulation layer, so that will almost certainly mean increased power consumption / shorter battery life. Valve isn't saying anything about battery life yet (except for the 40-hour per AA controller claim), as they continue to work on the software for now. But like the Steam Deck, this means your gaming time on the Steam Frame is going to vary dramatically, depending on whether you're streaming from a PC or playing something directly on the device.

And the headset definitely felt like it was working harder when running games on the Arm chip rather than streaming. The only time I actively noticed the Steam Frame's fan whirring was when playing the second game that Valve had me test on the headset itself, the VR title Ghost Town. It was very noticeable, but that was likely at least in part because the part of the game I was playing, exploring a small ship at sea, was pretty quiet.

You can see the fan, heatpipe, and other internals in this clear version that Valve had made solely to show off the internal layout. There is definitely a lot of hardware inside a fairly small headset.

 




This level of fan noise wouldn't be problematic for me when playing an action title or something with steady music, but it did slightly spoil the immersion in this one game. Hopefully, that's more the exception than the norm.

Adding your own headphones or earbuds might help with fan noise, but the speakers in the Steam Frame are part of the head strap mechanism. This was good for listening to Valve's engineers while I ran through demos, and sound generally felt fine when gaming, it's not the kind of isolating audio that you might want to be truly immersed in your game world.

Valve's software developer, Jeremy Selan, tried to assuage some of my fears about what Fex might do to battery life, saying the device uses Vulkan, that many games now are natively Vulkan, and that as soon as the game engine makes API calls, they start running in on “natively compiled Arm processing code.”

Similarly, on the CPU side, Selan says it's mostly things like the user interactions themselves (what happens when you pull a trigger or hit a jump button) that go through the Fex layer. He says there is about a 10-20% performance hit with the emulation, but that it only applies to specific aspects of the code.

“When we set out, we didn't know quite how far this would get,” said Selan. “But on games like Hades 2, where we are seeing 1440p at 90 Hz, while running the full VR stack. We're really very happy with it.”

As for which games you'll want to (or have to) run streaming from a PC to the Steam Frame, versus playing locally, Valve says all games (VR and non-VR) can be streamed to the headset from a PC. And similar to the Hades 2 demo, non-VR games will run in a resizable window.For games installed and running on the headset itself, Valve tells me there will be a ""Verified"" game program similar to what already exists for the Steam Deck, where the company is going to test titles in the Steam catalog and provide guidance. The company's goal is for the Steam Frame experience to be as frictionless as possible, so that people can focus on playing their Steam titles. But obviously there needs to be some distinction between games that you'll need to be near your gaming PC to play, and games you've installed natively and can play while you're at home or traveling with your headset.

Selan also says the Valve team is working on a way to pre-cache the CPU shaders, in a similar way that the company already pre-caches GPU shaders ahead of time on the Steam Deck. This should further reduce the overhead of Valve's Fex emulation layer, but it's not shipping yet.

 




That all sounds good, but Hades 2, which happily runs on the Nintendo Switch, obviously isn't the most demanding title. Again, I'm quite curious to see how the promised “new way to play your entire Steam library” holds up when we get review units – as well as what battery life is like. Obviously, I don't expect the Steam Frame with a smartphone chip to run games like a dedicated gaming rig, but Borderlands 4 is a recent addition to my Steam library, and it can bring my RTX 4090 to its knees.

“From the partner's perspective, we're trying to minimize the effort to get their software on this device,” said Selan, wrapping up my Steam Frame session.”And from a customer's perspective, they shouldn't have to think about anything. They're just going to hit play.

”We'll learn more about how smooth the streaming and native experience is, as well as battery life and how much the Steam Frame costs, as we get closer to launch, which Valve representatives said should be early next year.

 November 12, 2025  

Epinephrine nasal spray works well even if patients sniff while using it, according to an abstract presented at the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (ACAAI) 2025 Annual Meeting in Orlando, Florida.

The FDA last year fast-tracked approval of the first nasal epinephrine (neffy). The spray offers patients an alternative to injectable epinephrine pens, but because it is still a new device, “people still have a lot of questions,” said Jonathan Spergel, MD, PhD, chief of the Allergy Section at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, who led the study.

One of those questions is whether sniffing during or after administering nasal epinephrine would alter the efficacy of the drug. Because patients in clinical trials did not sniff while using neffy, patient instructions advise patients against sniffing during or after a dose.

“That's a natural reaction when people do a nose spray, to sniff,” Spergel said. “People were concerned about whether that was going to affect how well the drug works.”

Spergel and his team recruited 42 adults for a phase 1, single-dose, randomized crossover study. Each patient sprayed 2 mg of nasal epinephrine into their nostril at a doctor's office and was filmed so the researchers could confirm whether they sniffed while taking the spray. Of the 42 participants, 29 sniffed and 12 did not sniff. Clinicians took plasma samples after each dose, which were tested to determine participants' concentration of plasma epinephrine.

Taking intranasal epinephrine without sniffing resulted in a slightly higher average maximum epinephrine plasma concentration (484 pg/mL; coefficient of variation [CV], 67%), but the difference was not statistically significant compared with people who sniffed (382 pg/mL; CV, 67%).

In a second part of the study, patients received a 0.3 mg injection of intramuscular epinephrine. The average plasma concentration was slightly lower than it was when people sniffed intranasal epinephrine (322 pg/mL; CV, 65%).

Both options work well, Spergel said, “sniff or no sniff.”

The findings are welcome news for patients, said Ruchi Gupta, MD, MPH, founding director of the Center for Food Allergy & Asthma Research at Northwestern University and Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Chicago.

“People get apprehensive when there is a new device, so the more data we have, the better,” Gupta said.

Although the study was conducted in adults, the results likely apply to kids, who could especially benefit from needleless options for epinephrine, she said. Gupta has experience with nasal epinephrine, both through her patients and with her own daughter.

“She's used both the autoinjector and the nasal spray, and there was a pretty equivalent reaction,” she said.

The study was funded by ARS Pharma, the makers of neffy. Spergel reported receiving grant support from and consulting on trial development for ARS Pharma.

The use of virtual reality (VR) during skin prick testing (SPT) significantly reduced procedural anxiety, fear, and pain in children while achieving 100% compliance compared with standard care. 

“[Our study] findings support the integration of VR as a standard adjunctive tool in pediatric allergy diagnostics,” the authors wrote. “Broader implementation, alongside further research into long-term outcomes, economic impact, and personalization strategies, could transform pediatric procedural care by fostering a more cooperative, efficient, and child-friendly clinical environment,” they added.

Rita Nocerino, with the University of Naples Federico II, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on November 1, 2025, in Pediatric Allergy and Immunology.

The single-center design and relatively small sample size may have limited the generalizability of the study. The open‑label design may have introduced reporting bias, and novelty effects and varying levels of individual engagement with VR content may also have influenced the results.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Like many of you, I've been following the media coverage of a recent American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) abstract presentation suggesting higher rates of polyps and advanced adenomas among marathon and ultramarathon runners. The New York Times headline “Are Marathons and Extreme Running Linked to Colon Cancer?” was attention-grabbing. Since the article published, I have received a flurry of texts and emails from fellow runners asking me, “Should I be worried?”

I'm Alicia Muratore, MD, MBA, a gastroenterologist and recent graduate from the fellowship at the University of North Carolina, and this is Gut Instincts.

This study hits close to home for me. Outside the endoscopy suite, I have run 14 marathons since 2016, and even a 30-mile ultradistance run. Running is a huge part of my life. When headlines suggest a possible connection between extreme endurance running and colorectal cancer, I pay attention — not just as a gastroenterologist, but as part of the running community that feels implicated.

What has the study actually found? The ASCO abstract reported that 39% of long-distance runners aged 30-50 had at least one polyp, and 15% had advanced adenomas compared to historical controls of 1.2%. That's a striking number. 

The context matters. This was an abstract presentation. There was not a matched control group of nonrunners. We don't yet know whether unmeasured lifestyle or dietary factors could explain part of the difference. While patients with suspected inflammatory bowel disease, familial adenoma, ptosis, polyposis, or Lynch syndrome were excluded, other family history of colorectal cancer was not yet reported. 

Other current medical literature consistently suggests that regular physical activity, including running, reduces colorectal cancer risk, whereas sedentary behavior is a recognized risk factor, especially in early-onset disease. 

Additionally, other large-scale meta-analyses show running is associated with lower cancer mortality, with no evidence that higher doses of running confer additional risk. It's an intriguing signal but not yet practice-changing evidence. 

Why is it worth talking about? Even if causality isn't established, the study touches a nerve because we already know colorectal cancer is rising among younger adults. Incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer is climbing at approximately 2%-3% per year in the US. By 2030, colorectal cancer is projected to become the leading cause of cancer death in people under 50. 

Whether you're a runner or not, the broader message is the same: Younger people are facing a rising colorectal cancer risk and vigilance is key.

How does this affect clinical practice? For us in gastroenterology, here's what I tell my patients and my fellow runners: One, this doesn't change current screening guidelines. Average-risk adults should begin screening at 45. High-risk patients still need earlier, tailored strategies. 

Two: Symptoms matter. Blood in the stool, new changes in bowel habits, and unexplained anemia should never be dismissed as just hemorrhoids or just training fatigue. These symptoms warrant a discussion and an evaluation with a physician. 

Three: Running itself remains beneficial. Regular moderate exercise reduces the risk for multiple cancers, including colorectal cancer.Extreme training might introduce unique physiologic stressors, but the evidence is far from conclusive.

Four: Screening saves lives. Colonoscopy with adenoma removal can reduce colorectal cancer mortality. For a population that's disciplined enough to run marathons, adherence to screening is an achievable and life-saving goal.

Here's my takeaway as both a runner and a gastroenterologist, as someone who's trained for marathons while on fellowship call weeks. I understand the lifestyle, the passion, and the identity tied to running. I also understand the anxiety that this kind of study can stir up in a community that prizes health. 

My advice to patients and to running partners alike: Lace up, keep running, but don't outrun your colon health. Screening saves lives, and paying attention to symptoms matters more than your weekly mileage. 

As for us gastroenterologists, let's use this media moment to engage our patients, including athletes, in conversations about colorectal cancer risk, symptom awareness, and the proven power of prevention.

Thank you.

Long-term treatment with tocilizumab was effective in patients with moderate-to-severe thyroid eye disease (TED) that was resistant to corticosteroids, with 58% of patients achieving clinical improvement at 6 months and benefits continuing through 12 months. The treatment showed durability, with a relapse rate below 10% at 6 months after discontinuation.

“In addition to demonstrating control of the disease, our study indicates a low relapse rate of 8.3% at 18 months,” the researchers reported. “Additionally, MRI could assist physicians in managing TED,” they wrote.

The study was led by Florian Dalmas, MD, of the Department of Ophthalmology at Hôpital Nord, Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Marseille, Marseille, France. It was published online on November 10, 2025, in the European Journal of Endocrinology. 

The retrospective design and relatively small patient population were key limitations of the study, according to the researchers. The two different tocilizumab regimens were combined into a single cohort. Patients with active TED for more than 12 months prior to initiation of tocilizumab were excluded from the study.

No specific funding was received. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Macrophages and dendritic cells are central players in the innate immune system. Their dysregulation is implicated in a wide range of diseases, including autoimmunity, inflammation, cancer, and infectious diseases.

However, novel drug target identification in these cells has been difficult because these cells were - until now - refractory to high-content CRISPR screening approaches. Myllia has solved this problem, developing the Versatile Integrated Screening for Target Analysis – VISTA™ platform, enabling CRISPR screens in primary human myeloid cells.

The platform links CRISPR perturbation to transcriptomic responses, thus providing high-content functional readouts of novel gene targets involved in regulating many processes, including the tumor-immune interface relevant for immuno-oncology. 

Here, Myllia presents a pooled CRISPR screen to dissect IFN-γ signaling in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and dendritic cells (MDCs). Their platform, therefore, enables large-scale CRISPR screens with complex readouts to support drug discovery campaigns.

Published today in Mayo Clinic Proceedings, a University of Minnesota Medical School research team found that access to wheelchairs through Medicare-listed suppliers is inconsistent and often challenging.

Using a secret-shopper approach where researchers posed as patients seeking care, the research team evaluated insurance acceptance, administrative requirements, delivery timelines and costs in two urban zip codes. Only one-half of suppliers with wheelchairs in supply accepted Medicare, and many imposed additional documentation requirements. Among these suppliers, nearly half reported it would take several weeks before wheelchair approval and delivery. 

For those paying cash, the median wheelchair cost was $300. Most suppliers accepting Medicare did not mention Medicare's rent-to-own program for wheelchairs.

Patients attempting to access a wheelchair through suppliers listed in the Medicare directory face administrative and logistical challenges, highlighting the need for urgent policy form to assist vulnerable older adults in accessing critical medical equipment. Greater oversight of supplier practices, clearer standards and improved directory accuracy are needed to reduce administrative and financial barriers for beneficiaries.""

Arjun Gupta, MBBS, assistant professor, University of Minnesota Medical School

Further studies are suggested to expand to rural and diverse geographic settings, evaluate the accuracy of Medicare's supplier directory and assess the real-world impact of access barriers on patients and caregivers.

""Patients with mobility issues are often forced to navigate a maze of phone calls, insurance rejections and paperwork just to get a basic wheelchair. These delays and barriers leave many with no choice but to pay out-of-pocket through online marketplaces or other sources- this is an unacceptable burden on those already facing health problems,"" said Dr. Gupta, who is also an oncologist with M Health Fairview.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Scientists reveal mathematical law governing limits of biological growth","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251111/Scientists-reveal-mathematical-law-governing-limits-of-biological-growth.aspx","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 00:50:00 GMT","

A research team including a scientist of Earth-Life Science Institute (ELSI) at Institute of Science Tokyo, Japan, has identified a novel principle in biology that mathematically explains why the growth of organisms slows as nutrients become more abundant-a phenomenon known as ""the law of diminishing returns.""

Understanding how living organisms grow under various nutritional environments has long been a central question in biology. Across microbes, plants, and animals, growth is shaped by the availability of nutrients, energy, and cellular machinery. While extensive research has explored these limitations, most studies focus only on individual nutrients or specific biochemical reactions, leaving a broader question unanswered: how do complex, interconnected cellular processes collectively regulate growth under constrained conditions?

To address this, a research team consisting of ELSI's Specially Appointed Associate Professor Tetsuhiro S. Hatakeyama and RIKEN Special Postdoctoral Researcher Jumpei F. Yamagishi has discovered a unifying principle that explains how all living cells regulate growth when resources are limited. Their study introduces the global constraint principle for microbial growth, a concept that could transform how scientists approach the study of biological systems.

For nearly eight decades, researchers have relied on the ""Monod equation"" in microbiology, formulated in the 1940s, to describe microbial growth. According to the Monod equation, growth rates increase with an increase in nutrients before reaching a stable growth. However, the model assumes that only one nutrient or biochemical reaction restricts microbial growth. In fact, cells carry out thousands of interacting chemical processes, all competing for the same limited resources.

According to the team, the Monod equation captures only part of the picture. Rather than a single bottleneck, cellular growth is shaped by a network of constraints acting together, resulting in the familiar flattening of growth rates, though caused by an entirely different reason. The global constraint principle explains the fact that when one nutrient becomes more abundant, other factors such as enzyme availability, cell volume, or membrane capacity, begin to limit growth. Using a method called ""constraint-based modeling"" that models how cells manage their resources, the team showed that adding more nutrients always helps microbes grow, but each additional nutrient has a lower effect on growth than the previous one.

""The shape of growth curves emerges directly from the physics of resource allocation inside cells, rather than depending on any particular biochemical reaction,"" says Hatakeyama.

This new principle unites two classic biological laws: the Monod's equation, which describes microbial growth, and the Liebig's law of the minimum, which states that a plant's growth is limited by whichever nutrient is in shortest supply, such as nitrogen or phosphorus. In other words, even if a plant has plenty of most nutrients, it can only grow as much as the scarcest nutrient allows. By combining these concepts, the researchers created a ""terraced barrel"" model. In this model, different limiting factors take effect sequentially as nutrients increase. This explains why both microbes and higher organisms show diminishing returns and growth slows down even when more nutrients are added, because a new limiting factor becomes dominant.

Hatakeyama likens his theory to an updated version of Liebig's barrel, where a plant can only grow as much as its shortest stave (i.e., its most limited nutrient) allows. ""In our model, the barrel staves spread out in steps,"" he explains, ""each step representing a new limiting factor that becomes active as the cell grows faster.""

To test their theory, the team used large-scale computer models of Escherichia coli, which include how the cells utilize proteins, how they are spatially packed, and the capacities of their membranes. The simulations showed the predicted slowing of growth as more nutrients were added and revealed how oxygen or nitrogen levels affect growth patterns. The results agreed well with lab experiments, confirming the model's accuracy.

The discovery provides a fresh perspective for looking at growth across all forms of life. Combining different principles, the global constraint principle explains complex biological behaviors without needing to model every single molecule in detail.

Our work lays the groundwork for universal laws of growth. By understanding the limits that apply to all living systems, we can better predict how cells, ecosystems, and even entire biospheres respond to changing environments.""

Jumpei F. Yamagishi, RIKEN Special Postdoctoral Researcher

The significance of the research goes beyond basic biology. It may help improve microbial production in industry, increase crop yields by pinpointing limiting nutrients, and guide predictions of ecosystem responses under changing climates. Future studies could help explore how the principle applies to different organisms and the way multiple nutrients are used together. By connecting microbial biology with ecological theory, this study takes a major step towards a universal foundation for understanding the limits of life's growth.

World Cup

2026 World

Cup Countdown

 Chris Tanouye / FIFA / Getty Images

FIFA hiked ticket prices for dozens of 2026 World Cup games ahead of the second phase of sales, which began Wednesday.

The initial prices, described last month by fan groups as “super high,” “astonishing” and “unacceptable,” were already multiple times higher than those at previous World Cups. But, sensing strong demand, FIFA raised the cost of many tickets to new record-setting heights — the first large-scale implementation of its “variable pricing” strategy.

The price of a Category 1 ticket to the 2026 World Cup final, the most expensive non-hospitality ticket, jumped from $6,730 last month to over $7,000 this month, according to multiple fans who gained access to pricing data.

The cost of upper-deck tickets to the final also rose, with most now priced at $5,055 (up from $4,210 last month) or $3,450 (up from $2,790).

Prices for many group stage games in the United States stayed stagnant. But tickets for the games in Mexico and Canada, which generally sold quicker in last month's “Visa Presale” phase, got more expensive across the board, with some prices rising by around 25%, according to screenshots and data seen by The Athletic.

And in the knockout rounds, prices for every single match jumped in at least one category. For the first semifinal at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, a Category 1 ticket now costs $3,295 (up from $2,780 at the start of the previous phase). A Category 2 ticket is $2,350 (up from $1,920) and a Category 3 ticket is $930 (up from $720).

In most stadiums, according to color-coded maps embedded in FIFA's ticketing portal, Category 1 encompasses the entire lower bowl and most or all of the second deck. Category 2 is predominantly the upper deck along the sidelines, while Category 3 is the upper deck above either goal. Category 4 tickets appear to be extremely scarce — confined to the upper portion of a few corner sections in the upper decks of stadiums. (Fans buy tickets by category, and FIFA assigns the exact section, row and seat closer to the start of the tournament.)

FIFA has not said how many tickets are available in each category. In fact, soccer's global governing body has not communicated pricing details to the general public at all, as it did ahead of past World Cups. It has tightly guarded prices, and hasn't made executives available for interviews. It even refused to reveal prices to fans who bought the “right to buy” tickets and clamored for the transparency they'd been promised.

But on Wednesday, the ticket portal opened to a random selection of fans in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. They'd entered FIFA's second lottery, the “early ticket draw,” and won the opportunity to purchase tickets to World Cup games in their country during a so-called “domestic exclusivity period.”

After hours-long waits in digital queues, they saw and revealed prices. Among the other matches subject to price hikes were:

Prices for the U.S. opener at SoFi Stadium did not change — perhaps because those tickets did not sell as quick as others in the first sales phase. On Wednesday, they were still listed at:

But for the USMNT's game in Seattle on June 19, they rose by 13% in Category 1, 16% in Category 2 and 22% in Category 3, to:

Prices also rose for the USMNT's third game, to:

Prices for Mexico's opener, the very first game of the World Cup, rose by around 20%:

Most other tickets, at this stage, are still for matches between unknown teams. Most matchups and game locations will be determined on Dec. 5 at the World Cup draw and shortly thereafter when FIFA sets the schedule.

Soon after that, FIFA will open a third ticket lottery phase, and its variable pricing strategy will likely kick in again.

Chelsea skipper Reece James has sent a warning to FIFA ahead of the 2026 World Cup as he urged the football's governing body to rethink kick-off times to protect players from potentially ""dangerous"" heat conditions. The 25-year-old defender, who lifted the Club World Cup with Chelsea in the United States earlier this year, described the sweltering temperatures during the tournament as ""super difficult"" and believes that matches played in similar conditions next summer could put players' health at risk.

A recent study by Queen's University Belfast found that 14 of the 16 stadiums hosting matches in North America could reach or exceed temperatures deemed unsafe for prolonged physical activity. During Chelsea's pre-tournament training sessions in Philadelphia, the team faced a severe heat warning with temperatures hitting 37°C and humidity levels pushing the perceived temperature closer to 45°C. The club's Argentine midfielder Enzo Fernandez nearly collapsed during the game against Fluminense. He later revealed that he ""felt dizzy"" and needed medical attention midway through the game. 

 ""Thank you for asking that question, because honestly, the heat is incredible,"" he said. ""The other day, I got a bit dizzy during a play and had to go down to the ground. Playing in this kind of temperature is very dangerous. Especially for the spectacle as well, for the people who come to enjoy the game at the stadium, and for those watching at home. The pace of the game isn't the same; everything slows down a lot. Hopefully next year they change the schedule at least, so that it's more of a show, and football stays beautiful and exciting.""

James echoed those concerns and believes the solution lies in rescheduling kick-off times to cooler evening hours, especially for the games staged in southern and central US states. 

""It's super difficult conditions to play in that heat, especially us playing in England - there's not anything like that before,"" said James. ""Later kick-offs when it's not so hot and humid. That would definitely help. For sure, that would definitely help.""

When asked if FIFA had got in touch with him for any feedback, he replied, ""No, I haven't been asked about my thoughts on kick-off times. I'm sure they will have asked someone. Maybe managers or people at the clubs. I'm sure they will have got some feedback.""

According to The BBC, FIFA is considering late-night kick-offs for matches involving major European nations to mitigate the heat issue. This could mean start times mirroring the Club World Cup's schedule, with games at 17:00, 20:00, 23:00 and even 02:00 BST. Such timings would help avoid the worst of the afternoon sun in the US while also catering to international TV audiences. 

""You feel the heat the minute you step outside the hotel. The conditions are super hot,"" James continued. ""Once you are out there you adapt the longer you are there, when you are settled in once place and try to limit the things you can. The pitches when we were there weren't the greatest either and made it a little bit harder but hopefully by the time the World Cup comes around hopefully it's better.""

England have already secured qualification with two games to spare, and preparations are underway for the unique climate challenge that awaits them across the pond. Assistant coach Anthony Barry confirmed that the team will hold a warm-weather training camp in Florida to help players acclimatise to the conditions. Players will also undergo specific fitness conditioning to cope with the intense humidity that can sap energy and concentration. 

Concerns over player welfare in extreme temperatures are nothing new. The 2022 Qatar World Cup was moved to winter to avoid similar risks, but this time, with matches spread across three countries and multiple time zones, the challenge remains unprecedented. Cooling breaks will be an important tool to counter the heat, but more exhaustive measures are required to ensure player safety. ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Thomas Tuchel faces some tough decisions ahead of next year's World Cup, with the England boss revealing some players will be omitted as they won't all fit into his playing system. The Three Lions head coach has warned a big-name trio they can't start a game together as he puts the final touches to his plans ahead of the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Many managers would love to enjoy the attacking options at Tuchel's disposal. The German boss possesses a wealth of talent, but faces the challenge of harmonising them effectively. Harry Kane remains the central figure, though Tuchel must decide how best to integrate other stars. Phil Foden offers versatility, while rising talents like Morgan Rogers and Cole Palmer (injured in recent weeks) challenge for creative midfield spots. The competition for places means the final attacking line-up for the World Cup is far from settled.  

The relationship between Tuchel and midfielder Jude Bellingham has been a notable issue. Bellingham was controversially left out of the October squad, with Tuchel citing a need for rhythm and team cohesion. The manager has also publicly commented on Bellingham's aggressive on-field demeanour, suggesting it can be ""repulsive"" and must be channelled constructively. Bellingham was recalled for the November games, but the saga highlights the pressure on the young dynamo to adapt to Tuchel's structured approach. And that could mean heartbreak for certain stars, with the German tactician saying Kane, Bellingham and Foden ""cannot play"" together.

Tuchel told talkSPORT: ""At the moment, if we keep the structure, they cannot play. They can, but not in the structure, not for the balance that we developed. Not for the structure that also comes with wingers who are like specialists in their positions. At the moment, we play with a No. 6, a No. 8, a No. 10 and a No. 9. 

""There is a lot of congruence, especially in the No. 10 position, if you think about Phil can play there, you think about Jude, you think about Morgan Rogers who played fantastic for us in this position. You have Cole Palmer, you have Morgan Gibbs-White, so there are a lot of players, and there is the chance that we will not take everyone. Not because we don't like (them), not because they don't individually deserve it, but we will always do what's best for the team. We will always do what's best for winning, we will always do what's best for balance, and we will try to keep the clarity, even if it means that we have to take tough decisions. We take tough decisions in any camp, and this will not change when we go to a tournament.""

When asked if this decision puts Foden's place under the most jeopardy, Tuchel replied: ""Yes and no. If you're a unique player, you can play both positions. I think he can play the No.9, he can play the No.10, it gives him an advantage to compete for both positions. For Man City, he plays almost like a No.8/10, so maybe during the next months, we consider him as a No.8. But again, I see a very, very low percentage that we take five No.10s into a tournament, I don't see how this will help.""

England have already qualified for the 2026 World Cup after securing a first-place finish in Group K with two matches to spare. The Three Lions have so far gone unbeaten in their qualification campaign by winning all six of their games and have two final qualifiers coming up against Serbia at Wembley on Thursday and Albania in Tirana on Sunday.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

MEYBA are back and have cooked up a third collaboration with The Beatles, completing a trilogy which brings together football, music, art and culture. They've already achieved great success together with two previous drops, and for their final act in this series, they have gone all in to bring back the spirit of Yellow Submarine, one of the world's very first cross-platform successes.

The collection features three new football shirts, coming hot off MEYBA's drops honouring Abbey Road and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The extra distinction with Yellow Submarine is its wider cultural impact, with its psychedelic colour scheme and popping visuals coming from the animated film of the same name in 1968, two years after the release of the album.

Yellow Submarine is widely credited with the boom in vibrant art styles seen in animation for the decades that followed. MEYBA has sought to stay true to that in this modern reboot, with each football shirt a tribute to locations within the film. The black-and-white number represents the Sea of Holes, while the titular submarine and the Blue Meanies are instantly recognisable with their associated palettes.

Accompanying the football shirts for this drop are limited edition graphical t-shirts, adorned with either an 'All You Need Is Love' quote or the idiosyncratic submarine in a reversed colour scheme.

Though the main palettes on these t-shirts are perhaps less exciting, coming in white, black and grey, the contrast to the funkier colours of the graphics themselves make them stand out from the crowd in true late-sixties Beatles fashion.

Talk about a coveted piece of merch. This stunning varsity jacket features caricatures of the band's four members - John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr - on jet black sleeves, with the deep blue of the Blue Meanies again featuring on the body. A Yellow Submarine patch appears with the MEYBA logo on the front, with another cartoon of the band all together on the back.

The latest MEYBA x The Beatles collection is available to buy from MEYBA.com.

MEYBA, once one of Spain's most revered sportswear producers and Barcelona's partner when they won their first European Cup in 1992, have been busy making football shirts fit for all sorts of cross-cultural purposes, from festivals to food to music and more.

Jonathan Jones, MEYBA's Head of Global Marketing, said: ""This collection represents everything MEYBA stands for - creativity, nostalgia, and cultural storytelling through football design. Yellow Submarine allowed us to blur the lines between sport, art, and music in a joyful, playful way.""

It's only fitting that the trilogy wraps up with a Spanish brand honouring a piece of art called Yellow Submarine, given that is the nickname of one of the country's most successful teams and Champions League side Villarreal, who hail from a community town of around 50,000 people.

This is, however, not the end of MEYBA's return to football or their adventures dipping into other cultures and mediums, with an exciting future still in their sights having agreed deals with clubs all over the world.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Osaka joined a chorus of praise from fellow players towards Townsend during this year's US Open when the American was subject to a verbal tirade from Jelena Ostapenko following their second-round match—Ostapenko declaring Townsend had “no class” and “no education.”“I know Taylor and I know how hard she's worked and I know how smart she is,” Osaka said in a post-match press conference that week, “so she's the furthest thing from uneducated or anything like that.”Townsend went on to finish runner-up in the US Open women's doubles event and qualify for her first WTA Finals, partnering world No. 1 Katerina Siniakova to go undefeated in round-robin play before falling in the finals to No. 2 seeds Gabriela Dabrowski and Erin Routliffe.“I really feel like the type of tennis that I played and just the way that the person and the player that I am now really gained a lot of respect in the locker room amongst my counterparts,” Townsend said of her season in New York.“Even Novak [Djokovic] said something to me. Jannik [Sinner] said something to me. Like, ‘Hey, like, you played really well, keep going, keep going.' Everyone was watching. Even sometimes when you think, oh, nobody is, like, whatever, but they're watching. For them to actually go out of their way to comment something to me, it means everything.”

All of that makes for a well-deserved off-season for Townsend and Osaka, who reached the semifinals of women's singles at the US Open and earned her first Top 20 finish since becoming a mom in 2023.“Honestly, it's kind of inspiring for me, because it makes me just want to train and try to get better, and hopefully, yeah, just give it my very best shot again and see what happens,” Osaka said after her semifinal defeat to Amanda Anisimova.In the meantime, the sport's latest dynamic duo will refresh, recharge and, in the words of 4 Non Blondes frontwoman Linda Perry, “pray for a revolution” in 2026.

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's weekend to forget in Sao Paulo

Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll report back on how the Sao Paulo Grand Prix went for Aston Martin.

Fernando Alonso was left to reflect on a fruitless Sao Paulo Grand Prix where he failed to score for Aston Martin, coming home in 14th place. He did at least beat his team mate Lance Stroll, who finished in P16 after two lots of contact during the race.

It was a far cry from what the team had hoped for when they qualified both cars in the top seven for the Sprint, with Alonso going on to score with sixth place. But their pace went away from them when qualifying for the Grand Prix, with both failing to earn a berth in Q3.

Both drivers gambled on a hard tyre for the start, but the unfavoured C2 compound did not come into its own under higher fuel loads, which did not help their cause. But Alonso remained upbeat with the strategy calls regardless of how they panned out.

“We tried with a hard tyre at the start. I was happy to risk a little bit,” the Spaniard explained.

“I knew that there was some risk on the strategy, but if we do the same as the others, then we just follow each other and probably, we would just finish behind them, so we tried something different. It didn't work, but at least we tried.”

Alonso came home in a DRS train, right on the tail of Carlos Sainz, who at that point in time was on the same medium compound.

When asked what changed across the weekend in terms of Aston Martin's pace, the former World Champion was less concerned with his own team – but rather looked externally to the rest of the field.

“I think the others got everything together and it is going to be the same in Qatar. Friday will be our best day.”

As for Stroll, he had a torrid first lap. First, he made contact with Gabriel Bortoleto, and was fortunate not to crash out like his rival did. He was then hit from behind by Yuki Tsunoda and tagged into a spin for good measure, which dropped him off the back of the pack.

In the end, he two-stopped his way to a dispiriting P16 finish.

“We lost a lot of time at the beginning when I got hit by Yuki. I lost like 15 seconds and then that was kind of the end of the race. We tried to come back but we lost a lot of time there,” the Canadian explained.

“We were more competitive in the Sprint, then in normal Qualifying and the main race, we were less competitive, so we'll see what we can do in a couple of weeks in Las Vegas.”

Aston Martin remain seventh in the Teams' Championship, but they are now 10 points behind Racing Bulls.

Television Business Editor


Netflix has picked up a drama series about a high school hockey team in Minnesota, with Michelle Monaghan set to star. 


	The untitled series, which has an eight-episode order, comes from creator Nick Naveda and Shawn Levy's 21 Laps Entertainment. Bridget Bedard (Love Life, Ramy) will be the showrunner, and Trey Edward Shults is set to direct the first two episodes.




	The show is set in the town of South Dorothy, Minnesota, “where the high school hockey team has been churning out state championships and NHL stars for decades with their legendary Coach ‘Sully' Sullivan at the helm,” the logline reads. “When a bus crash claims the lives of several players and Sully himself, the town looks to Harper Sullivan (Monaghan) — Coach Sully's widow — to coach a new team of battered and broken young men. What unfolds is the hopeful and unforgettable story of an underdog team who comes together to galvanize their town, reclaim their way of life, and turn their shared grief into an unstoppable superpower.”

	“This show has long been a 21 Laps favorite and one of the best pieces we have had the privilege of developing and supporting,” Levy said in a statement. “Nick and Bridget have built a world and ensemble of characters that are rooted in authenticity and huge heart which, not surprisingly, attracted such great talent with our director Trey Edward Shults and lead Michelle Monaghan. With its visceral sports backdrop and a story grounded in deep humanity, we cannot wait to bring this show to a global audience.” 

	











	Added Naveda, “I've carried South Dorothy and its people in my heart for as long as I can remember. To finally bring that world to life with my Grizzly family at 21 Laps and Netflix is nothing short of a dream come true. Big love and gratitude to my partners for this opportunity, and for all their unyielding support over the years.”


	Bedard will executive produce the series with Levy, Dan Levine and Robert Atwood for 21 Laps and Shults. Moera Ainai serves as producer.


	Monaghan is coming off season three of The White Lotus at HBO. Her recent credits also include Apple TV's Bad Monkey and feature films MaXXXine and The Family Plan. She is repped by Gersh, Anonymous Content and Sloane Offer.

Vacuuming doesn't have to suck.

If your home is in need of a deep clean ahead of the holidays, why not try the fancy mop-vac combo that Martha Stewart swears by?

Last year, the lifestyle magnate and self-proclaimed “clean fanatic” raved about the Bissell CrossWave OmniForce in an unsponsored Instagram post, and the nifty gadget happens to be on sale ahead of Black Friday at Amazon.

“Rather than sweeping (which raises dust), rather than vacuuming and then mopping, this machine does it all!!!” Stewart raved in her caption, mentioning how her four dogs and many daily visitors are no match for this lean cleaning machine.

Made to replace your mops and work on both dry and wet spills, the CrossWave OmniForce also sanitizes — killing 99.9% of bacteria on sealed hard floors, according to the brand — and has a convenient tangle-free brush roller.

Bissell's Pet Hair Erasers and hand vacs are also bestsellers, but we are ready to toss our dirty mops and dusty vacs for this modern innovation.

For those looking to spend under $200, the popular CrossWave Edge and CrossWave Pet Pro is also included in Amazon's early Black Friday deals. (The latter's better for homes with pets, like Stewart's.)

One of the features Stewart likes best is how quickly these all-in-one vac-mops work — and who is not in favor of spending less time cleaning? (And more time lounging.)

Over 17,000 Amazon shoppers have given the CrossWave Pet Pro five-star ratings, and we're ready to make room for it in our pantry as well. No word on how long the deal will last, so don't delay!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","FX renews Alien: Earth for another season of technofascist terror and Ice Age references","https://www.avclub.com/alien-earth-noah-hawley-season-two","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 01:53:00 GMT","

This post discusses the plot of Alien: Earth.

FX will be hearing Noah Hawley scream in space (or Earth, we guess) for years to come. Earlier today, FX announced season two of Alien: Earth as part of a new overall deal with Hawley, the series creator. While many probably assumed a second season was a lock, considering how much FX spent promoting the series, the network was silent on the matter for the last few months. Viewership for the Alien reboot, which focused on a child synthetic who befriends a young Xenomorph hunter through the power of mouth sounds, was solid, particularly among Baby Boomers. However, the show ended in September, when Hawley suggested that it might take a few months to get an official word on season two. Still, unlike previous entries in the series, pretty much everyone of import survived this latest run-in with the creature that typically kills everyone. It even spared the douchey trillionaire making everyone's life miserable this season for the sake of bringing him back, we presume.

The new overall deal isn't too surprising. Since his adaptation of Fargo debuted in 2014, Hawley has been loyal to the network and its parent companies, squeezing in Legion for a few years between trips to North Dakota and the greater Twin Cities metropolitan area. In 2019, 20th Century Fox released Hawley's lone feature film, Lucy In The Sky. The point is, Hawley is a company man, which, in the world of Alien, always turns out well. The only question now is, what was with all the Ice Age stuff last season?

There is no word on when season two will premiere, but production of Alien: Earth, which is moving from Thailand to London, will begin next year.

Amid the thicket of awards season, it's sometimes nice to pause and smell the nonfiction roses. Documentary film festival DOC NYC is America's largest showcase of documentary films and this month comes to New York City from November 12-20, with another week of online screenings through November 30. (Take a look at the organization's DOC NYC Shortlist of the best documentaries of the year, many of which are returning to theaters for the event.)

IFC Center, SVA Theatre, and Village East by Angelika will host screenings of more than 200 films and events, including 30 world premieres as well as many revivals of the year's best in nonfiction filmmaking so far.

Directed by Asia Johnson (herself previously incarcerated) and Michael Kleiman, the film follows a group of incarcerated men as they prepare for a TED-style public speaking symposium. The event is designed to allow men to explore their humanity and narratives in ways that transcend their circumstances, in front of an audience of policymakers, prison officials, and their loved ones.

A world premiere earlier this year at CPH:DOX, Norwegian photographer-turned-filmmaker Monica Strømdahl brings a decidedly European lens to an American story: Of a family living in a rundown motel known as a flophouse. In the process, “Flophouse America” puts a telescopic lens on the overall housing crisis in the U.S., focused on 12-year-old Mikal, who lives in a constricted, inexpensive room with his hard-drinking parents and beloved cat, Smokey. This intimate documentary also doubles as a coming-of-age film, as Strømdahl tracked Mikal for more than three years, from childhood to young adulthood, and in often harrowing proximity to his parents.

 










Filmmaker Karla Murthy's immigrant portrait has been picking up buzz at other American festivals but makes its New York City premiere at DOC NYC. In “The Gas Station Attendant,” the South Asian-descended director reflects on her father's life, when he ran away from home to leave the poverty of his Indian village. His life changed after meeting a Texan couple, received a sponsored visa, and arrived in the United States — but the American dream, for H.N. Shantha Murthy, was not easily won. The film weaves home videos, phone conversations, and more to create an intimate love letter addressed to the immigrant working class.

Celia Aniskovich goes behind the curtain of a singular New York City holiday tradition: The Christmas tree trade, in which merchants set up shop across the five boroughs to sell firs on sidewalks. “The Merchants of Joy” follows five families hustling every winter to maintain the beloved tradition, and in a market rife with competition over tree sources as well as locations. New York City's own seasonal stand workers add texture to a documentary that tries to parse how the proceeds from just five weeks circa the holidays can make for a sustainable yearlong living.

“Do women make harsher films, and what does harsh even mean?” That's the question on filmmaker Isa Willinger's (“Plastic Fantastic”) mind with the cinematic ode “No Mercy.” The documentary features talking heads Céline Sciamma, Virginie Despentes, Nina Menkes, Catherine Breillat, Apolline Traoré, Joey Soloway, and Ana Lily Amirpour to examine how women (and more presently nonbinary filmmakers) have told stories onscreen since the 1960s. “No Mercy” also interweaves clips from nearly 50 films ranging the narrative to the experimental as filmmakers, and Willinger, reflect on their careers and how they've depicted violence, trauma, and power throughout their careers.

 










Filmmakers Jennifer Ash Rudick and Amanda Benchley chart four decades in “The Life and Time of Marilyn Minter,” a feminist provocateur who has been pushing against contemporary art's borders for almost five decades. The film interweaves rare footage, studio archival materials, and more glimpses into her artistic practice to trace her arc as a rising New York art star who was not without controversy for her brazenly sexual work. Jane Fonda, Naomi Fry, Jeff Koons, Monica Lewinsky, Padma Lakshmi, Lizzo, Laurie Simmons, and more among the celebrities who make an appearance in this fast-paced and entertaining documentary.

Pulled from Sundance due to significant developments in the story before ultimately premiering at Cannes, Eugene Jarecki's Julian Assange portrait “The Six Billion Dollar Man” arrives at DOC NYC this week. The “Why We Fight” and “The House I Live In” documentary filmmaker turns the story of the WikiLeaks founder into a tense inquiry into truth, power, and freedom of the press. The film features never-before-seen footage and unprecedented access to Assange — including CCTV footage from his time in confinement.

Filmmaker/actor Jeremy Xido returns to his home city of Detroit to untangle his complicated backstory as the white son of revolutionaries who then became “adopted” by an African American family in a mostly Black neighborhood. “Sons of Detroit” also charts a city shifting from its golden years as the epicenter of the automobile industry, circa Motor City and Motown days, to a city rattled by racism and violence and depleted industry. But it's also a love letter to the city, beginning in the 1970s through the present day, wherein Xido turns the camera back on himself to reconnect with an estranged chosen family member to examine what pulled them apart.

 










Zackary Canepari and Jessica Dimmock's gun violence documentary premieres at DOC NYC before heading to HBO later in November. Specifically, Canepari and Dimmock tackle the subject through the lens of school shootings and the increasing curricular preparation for them. They speak to teachers training with firearms who lead simulations of active shooter situations as well as students for whom preparing for a shooting is just part of the morning routine. Ultimately, the film takes a bird's eye view of a multi-billion-dollar industry that markets school safety with innovations like bulletproof desks. Anything but actual, tangible gun reform.

A decorated hit across multiple regional documentary festivals, Ian Bell chronicles the 1999 protest of the World Trade Organization, where 40,000 protests rallied against globalization beginning in Seattle and shared concerns about WTO's environmental and labor impacts. Anarchists, environmentalists, labor unions, and even religious organizations and more came together hoping to turn minds against support of the WTO, which was founded in 1995. The protest lasted from November 30 to December 3, and this film builds off 1,000 hours of archival footage to form an immersive look at a moment in time: a moment when environmental collapse and the end of the middle class were top-of-mind fears.

Robyn is back. Her first single in seven years, “Dopamine,” is out now, along with a performance video directed by Marili Andre. Watch it below.

Robyn explained the chemical inspirations behind “Dopamine” in a press release. “Everyone has a phone where they see their heart rate, and we're learning how to decode our emotions through the hormones and chemical substances in our bodies,” she said. “It's almost like we don't even accept that we're human anymore, like we're trying to shoot ourselves out of it and explain every single thing—which I think is great, but that's also why the world is shit, this idea that you can figure out and win life or something. The doubleness of ‘Dopamine' is having an emotion that is super real, super strong, intense, enjoyable or painful, and at the same time knowing that this is just a biological process in my body—and then not to choose religion or science. To just accept that they're there together and to be able to go in between.”

Teased for the past several weeks, Robyn's comeback reunites her with longtime collaborator Klas Åhlund, whose work with the Swedish pop star includes four songs on her last album, 2018's Honey. Åhlund was the first to tease the new music, saying on the podcast Nordmark Pod, in September, “Just finished a new Robyn album that's coming out. Super exciting! Very proud of it.”

Since Honey, Robyn has featured on songs by SG Lewis, Sigur Rós' Jónsi, Smile, Neneh Cherry, and Jamie xx, as well as on the Yung Lean–assisted remix of Charli XCX's “360” from Brat and It's Completely Different but Also Still Brat.

	A batch of Jeffrey Epstein's emails released by House Democrats Wednesday reveal that the late convicted sex offender wrote in 2019 that Donald Trump “knew about the girls” in Epstein's sex trafficking case, despite the president's constant denials over the years.


	In another email to confidante Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein wrote in 2011 that Trump spent “spent hours at my house” with one of the Epstein's victims, describing the future president as “the dog that hasn't barked,” noting that “he has never once been mentioned,” The New York Times reports. It's unclear what exactly Epstein meant when he said Trump had not been mentioned.


	The three emails were found among thousands of pages of documents that the House Oversight Committee obtained regarding the Epstein case. Two of the emails were between Epstein and author Michael Wolff, who at the time was writing a tell-all book about the Trump administration, with the other email being a conversation between Epstein and Maxwell, who was later convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison for her role in the sex trafficking case. Trump's Justice Department transferred Maxwell to a minimum-security facility earlier this year, and the president has not ruled out pardoning the convicted sex trafficker.

	











	“These latest emails and correspondence raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the president,” Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, said in a statement.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In one of the Wolff emails from January 2019 — just months before Epstein died by suicide in his prison cell in August 2019 — Epstein wrote: “Of course [Trump] knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop,” which calls into question Trump's denials about knowing the details of allegations against the financier prior to the sex trafficking case. The email does not elaborate on what exactly Trump allegedly asked Maxwell to “stop” doing.

	“Democrats continue to carelessly cherry-pick documents to generate clickbait that is not grounded in the facts,” Republicans on the House Oversight Committee said of the emails in a statement. “The Epstein Estate has produced over 20,000 pages of documents on Thursday, yet Democrats are once again intentionally withholding records that name Democrat officials.”


	While the Epstein case was overshadowed in recent weeks by the government shutdown, the scandal will likely come back into the forefront after Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona, is finally seated into Congress, two months after she was elected. Grijalva represents the deciding vote to force a measure demanding that the White House release of all Epstein files.


	Several revelations about Trump and Epstein have emerged since the Justice Department announced earlier this year that it would be closing its case into Epstein, and not releasing any more material. The Wall Street Journal reported on, and subsequently released, a birthday letter Trump allegedly wrote to Epstein in the early 2000s, one that included a lewd drawing of a female figure and in which Trump cryptically wrote that he and Epstein have “certain things in common.” Trump sued the outlet over the report, claiming the letter didn't actually exist. Once the letter was made public, Trump claimed his signature may have been forged.


	The Journal also reported that the Justice Department told Trump his name appears in the Epstein files.


	Trump has in recent years said that Epstein is a “creep” and that the two had a falling out. The president said in July that the falling out came after Epstein “stole” young women who were employed at Mar-a-Lago, including Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's victims who died by suicide earlier this year.


	“It was shocking to hear President Trump invoke our sister and say that he was aware that Virginia had been ‘stolen' from Mar-a-Lago,” Giuffre's family said in a statement to The Atlantic. “It makes us ask if he was aware of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal actions.”

	Trump has long claimed he had no knowledge of Epstein's illegal activities, but the two appeared to be close friends for several years, and Trump has lauded Epstein in the past, telling New York magazine in 2002 that Epstein is a “terrific guy” he has “known for 15 years.”


	“It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do,” Trump told the magazine, “and many of them are on the younger side.”

	It only took one sequel and Mario's already going into outer space. During a short Nintendo Direct this morning, Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto showed off the first official trailer for next year's The Super Mario Galaxy Movie (out April 26, 2026), featuring a new look at the animated interplanetary adventure.


	The follow-up to 2023's billion-dollar hit, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, was formally revealed back in September but the Nintendo livestream breaks open the mystery block on the film's story and characters, including many familiar faces for fans of the video games.


	Watch the trailer below.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The trailer begins with a look at diminutive Bowser (Jack Black), who is now living in a tiny version of his castle after being shrunk by a mini-mushroom at the end of the previous film. He retains an antagonistic relationship with Mario (Christ Pratt) but appears to be warming up to Luigi (Charlie Day). Their banter is followed by the arrival of a new threat, Bowser Jr., who aims to break his father out of the clutches of the plumber brothers. The teaser ends with a glimpse at an action sequence wherein new character Rosalina uses her magical powers to take down a giant robot.

	











	Following the trailer, Miyamoto kicked the presentation over to Illumination CEO, Chris Meledandri, to introduce the voice actors behind the two new additions: Brie Larson (Captain Marvel) as Rosalina, the godlike overseer of the cosmos, and Benny Safdie (Oppenheimer) as Bowser Jr.. One big omission is Yoshi, Mario's longtime dinosaur pal and ridable mount — although the character rarely has speaking lines in the games.

	











	Returning in their roles from the previous film are Pratt as Mario, Day as his brother Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, and Black as Bowser.


	The new additions have been hotly debated and joked about online following the lukewarm reception to the first movie's casting — primarily focused on Chris Pratt as Mario. Despite that left-field choice, the rest of the OG voice actors were much better received, with Charlie Day and Jack Black, especially, standing out as fan-favorites. Black's Bowser became so popular, he ultimately ended up being the unofficial marketing mascot for the film, with audiences leveraging for his performance of Bowser's ballad “Peaches” to be nominated for an Academy Award (it wasn't).

	While the 2023 Super Mario Bros. movie drew inspiration from numerous games in the franchise from all different eras of Nintendo history, the new film leans more heavily into two specific titles, 2002's Super Mario Sunshine and 2007's Super Mario Galaxy. The former introduced Bowser Jr., complete with his weaponized paint brush that's seen in the trailer. Most everything else seen comes from Galaxy, which is considered one of the best entries in the entire series, as well as an all-time great 3D platformer.

	Although it was met with mediocre reviews, The Super Mario Bros. Movie was a massive success for Nintendo and Illumination, grossing over $1 billion at the box office and having an extended run topping the streaming charts after releasing digitally on Peacock. The movie's reception was big enough to effectively wash away the sour taste of 1993's live-action catastrophe, with Nintendo accelerating its plans for future feature film adaptations of its properties, including a live-action take on The Legend of Zelda, due out in 2027.


The Super Mario Galaxy Movie arrives in theaters on April 26, 2026.

Ariana Grande declined the chance to explain, address, or backpedal her skepticism about the 1969 moon landing upon her highly anticipated return to the Vanity Fair lie-detector test. 


	During last year's wild Wicked press tour, Grande appeared on the same YouTube series, where her co-star Cynthia Erivo asked if she thought the moon landing was fake. Grande replied, “No,” but the polygraph machine ruled her answer “inconclusive.” Her subsequent insistence that she did not believe the moon-landing conspiracy also showed some deception. 


	The viral moment was, of course, addressed when Grande returned to the hot seat with Bowen Yang as the two promoted Wicked: For Good. When Yang asked Grande if she would like a chance to redeem herself, she curtly replied, “No. I want to move past it.”

	But Yang did not let this very pressing issue die. He asked Grande if she believed in the moon itself, to which she said, “I do.” He then asked if she believed there was a flag planted on the moon, to which Grande coyly replied, “You know, I hear both arguments.” 

	











	Grande then added forcefully, “The truth is, I don't give a rat's ass. I'm worried about Earth, goddammit! We're burning alive! We're killing each other! Can we worry about Earth for five minutes? Who gives a fuck about the moon and the flag?”

	Elsewhere during the lie-detector test, Yang interrogated Grande about group chats and attending Wimbledon with their co-star, Jonathan Bailey. Yang even got Grande to do her extremely impressive Lorne Michaels impression as she told the story of how she called the Saturday Night Live boss personally to convince him to let Yang take part in Wicked, despite some tricky scheduling.

	











	When Grande got the chance to turn the tables, she asked him several questions about the kiss they shared during a SNL sketch, including whether he thought Grande was a good kisser. Yang replied, “Yeah, you were really good,” though his answer was ruled “inconclusive.”

                Reading time 6 minutes
      

Paranormal Activity, one of the most recognizable franchises in modern horror, is about to do something none of the others have ever done. It's coming off the screen and into your reality as part of a brand new stage show.

The show is called, simply enough, Paranormal Activity, and after a debut in Chicago earlier this fall, it's opening at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles this week and running through December 7. From there, it'll be at the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, DC, from January 28 through February 7, followed by the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco from February 19 through March 15. It'll also be in the West End in London from December 5 through March 28.

But what exactly is this show? How is the unmistakable found footage genre going to make the leap from screen to stage? Well, io9 sat down with the show's writer, Levi Holloway, to find out.

Holloway, best known for the Broadway plays Grey House and Turret, starring Michael Shannon, came on board the project in 2023. Felix Barrett (who directed the popular immersive show Sleep No More) was already attached as director, and very quickly the pair got on the same page about what it meant to bring Paranormal Activity to the stage. “Felix and I had the same memory,” Holloway said about the original film. “It was less about the film itself and more about the marketing surrounding it. It was all the night vision and the audience kind of freaking out, and that seemed really exciting. It seemed like, ‘Well, that's just an audience. We could do that to an audience.' Not sure how, but we could do that.”

Before they solved that problem, though, Holloway needed a story. And, thankfully, the franchise's rights holder, Paramount, didn't really interfere with that. “Paramount gave us a very loose mandate,” Holloway said. “The mandate, if anything, was tonal, and it seemed to be more about, like, ‘Okay, well, is it about a couple who are beset by something?' ‘Yeah.' And that was sort of it. They were pretty hands-off. There's a huge leap of faith on their part, which we're so grateful for.”

The story that he and Barrett began working on is inspired by, but not narratively linked to, the movies in any way. Instead, it sort of mirrors their journey as creatives. Paranormal Activity is about a couple from Chicago who move to London and realize that places aren't the only thing that can be haunted. People can be haunted, too. At the time, Holloway was newly married and living in Chicago, and he traveled to London to meet with Barrett to discuss the project.

“I spent about a year over in London, doing R&D over there, and really started looking at their relationship with ghosts and stuff like that,” he said. “I wasn't really interested in the demon angle that the movies take. I'm not knocking it. It's just that in this sort of Christian structuring of that and the sort of good versus evil, God versus the devil stuff, wasn't really a story that I felt like I had a lot to add to. But I do have a lot to say about ghosts.”

Specifically, Holloway found inspiration in the Victorian spiritualist movement, which he felt “really glommed on to this idea of the afterlife and ghosts and mediums and paranormal as a way of processing grief from this massive loss in World War I.”

“So that was pretty fertile ground,” he said. “And that was a huge kickoff point for me in terms of storytelling. So you'll see some of those bones very lightly buried throughout the script.”

Holloway also found that, in addition to those historical inspirations, simply the idea of this couple moving to a new country helped give the show important staples of the horror genre. “With every good horror story, you try to figure out a way to isolate your characters because the big question is always like, ‘Why don't they run?'” Holloway said. “So you have to honor that question. And for me, the way to do that was, number one, what if places aren't haunted? What if people are haunted? You can't run from something that's in you or that is attached to you. And then the other way to isolate them is to make them strangers in a strange land, thousands of miles from everything they know.”

The writer, of course, rewatched the movies (the first and third are Holloway's favorites) and found two specific things he knew they had to recreate to make the show feel like a Paranormal Activity movie. “One is the restraint of it,” Holloway said. “For huge [amounts] of time in that first film, nothing happens. And it's in that nothing where anything becomes possible. It's very charged in its durational periods, and that was really exciting because that's anti-theatrical, right? We have this feeling when we're watching a play, people have got to be walking and talking, moving and shaking, you know? But that stillness, that negative space, those durational pauses are where you really start building a kind of electricity and charging an atmosphere with potential. And the other major ingredient was darkness. We play a lot with darkness. A huge, huge challenge, and something we are always talking about, is how do you submerge the audience in total darkness? When you do that, you're not only building a community, but you're also dislocating them… And I'm not talking about jump scares. I'm talking about breathless anticipation.”

But there's also the notion that Paranormal Activity is a found footage-driven franchise. Holloway admitted it would have been easy, and maybe obvious, to make it a more multimedia show with cameras and screens, but, instead, he and Barrett found a new way in. “[The play] fits in the movies in that it's kind of this raw gesture of weaponizing the mundane,” he said. “We wanted to capture that feeling of placing the audience in front of this sawed-off dollhouse and letting them peer into every room and sort of letting them bear witness to something maybe they shouldn't be seeing. And the audience is sort of a voyeur. Because we are voyeurs in this story, it becomes non-theatrical. It becomes kind of dangerous. It feels almost like Rear Window or something. We might as well be given binoculars to look into somebody's house.”

All of which, seemingly, could have been done without the name brand of “Paranormal Activity.” But Holloway thinks working within an established franchise was “both a gift and a burden.” “It has a very passionate built-in audience,” he said. “And, for the most part, I think the franchise is cashing the checks it writes. It's cool. It plays with the eye. It's stripped down. It's mostly placing ordinary humans in extraordinary circumstances. And that's a really cool catapult from which to launch a story. The burden of it is sort of all of those same things. As an audience, you have embedded expectations. You might meet audience members with crossed arms and say, ‘Prove it. Thrill me,' and I take that seriously. I love a good dare.”

For Holloway, that was the biggest dare of Paranormal Activity. Living up to expectations, while also giving audiences something new, exciting, and worthy. “[Found footage] is saying to the audience that this is real,” he said. “[But] you can't really do that at the theater. You can't bring an audience into a theater and make them think what's happening is real unless you subvert their expectations, which is sort of the whole kit and caboodle for us.”

Well, almost the whole thing. The Paranormal Activity franchise exists because of its sequels, and Holloway admits that while he doesn't want to look too far down the road, that is something he's thought about. “There are some very literal buns in the oven in terms of where this particular story could go, but nothing is set in stone,” he said. “Mostly, just the notebooks we have full of ideas and mischief that we want to make fit very neatly into the many more iterations in the Paranormal Activity world.”

When astronomers first spotted the fast-moving object 3I/ATLAS hurtling through the solar system in July 2025, speculation erupted online: was it another ʻOumuamua—or even an alien craft?

Months of data from NASA, JWST, and global observatories now provide a clear answer. 3I/ATLAS is indeed interstellar, but it's not extraterrestrial technology—it's a naturally formed, billion-year-old comet from another star system.

The Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile first detected 3I/ATLAS racing across the sky at extraordinary speed.

NASA Science later confirmed its hyperbolic trajectory, proving it was unbound to the Sun and would leave the solar system after its fly-through—making it only the third confirmed interstellar object after1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.

Almost immediately, Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb suggested that its unusual motion and brightness could hint at artificial propulsion. The idea spread quickly across social media, echoing his earlier claims about ʻOumuamua. But as new data arrived, that theory began to unravel.

The first breakthrough came from the MeerKAT Radio Telescope in South Africa. Scientists detected radio emissions consistent with cometary outgassing, not engineered transmissions, as reported by LiveScience.

Subsequent James Webb Space Telescope observations revealed an unusually high carbon-dioxide to water ratio (CO₂/H₂O ≈ 8 ± 1)—among the highest recorded in any comet. This ratio, astronomers say, reflects the extreme environment in which it formed, not alien machinery.

Further analysis using polarimetric imaging found a 'deep negative polarisation branch'—a scattering pattern unseen in ordinary asteroids but consistent with fine, porous dust from interstellar comets.

Even rumours of a post-perihelion explosion were dismissed; LiveScience confirmed the object remained intact. These findings collectively closed the door on the 'alien probe' narrative.

Experts say the fascination was inevitable. With only three known interstellar visitors ever recorded, the cosmic rarity alone fuelled public imagination.

Anomalous-looking features—such as faint acceleration, odd tail direction, and slowly fading brightness—added to the intrigue.

As Newsweek noted, social media's appetite for extraterrestrial mystery amplified every ambiguous observation. Yet, each anomaly found a natural explanation once more data became available.

Far from disappointing, the real story of 3I/ATLAS is even more compelling.

According to arXiv analyses, its surface is coated by a 15–20 metre-thick crust formed by billions of years of cosmic-ray exposure—potentially making it 7 billion years old, predating our own Sun.

Its extreme CO₂ content suggests it originated near the CO₂ ice-line of a distant protoplanetary disk or endured long-term radiation in interstellar space.

For astronomers, 3I/ATLAS offers a rare glimpse into material forged under alien stellar conditions—a frozen sample of another world, not a visiting spacecraft.

Scientists say 3I/ATLAS proves that the scientific process—not speculation—unveils cosmic truth.
Each new observation has transformed initial wonder into a deeper understanding of how planetary systems form beyond our own.

It reminds skywatchers that nature itself can be as strange and wondrous as any imagined alien technology.

In the end, 3I/ATLAS is no probe—it's a natural interstellar iceberg, silently carrying the history of another star system through our skies.

In the modern media landscape, it can feel like there are endless streaming services available for people to choose from. Despite that, the company that popularized the concept, Netflix, remains the industry leader since it has more worldwide subscribers than any of its competitors.

Given how successful Netflix is, it is a big deal when a show becomes available or departs the streaming service. Unfortunately for fans of one of the most popular and beloved paranormal horror-drama shows ever, it is set to leave Netflix soon.

Netflix has announced that all 15 seasons of Supernatural will be leaving on December 18, 2025. That means that, as of the time of this writing, fans have just over a month, or 36 days, left to watch the show on Netflix.

As an October 2011 Screen Rant article shows, many Supernatural seasons were added to Netflix in January 2012. In November 2020, the final season of the much-beloved show became available to watch on the streaming service. That timing is interesting since the timing of when Supernatural will be leaving Netflix was decided because of when the final season was added.

Since streaming services have forever changed how TV shows are watched, people have become used to seeing series move from one to another. As a result, many people rarely think about what leads to non-original shows becoming available and leaving different streaming services. With that in mind, it is interesting to look at why Supernatural is leaving Netflix and how the departure is part of a disappointing pattern for many users.

In May 2019, Deadline published an article about the business relationship that led to Netflix becoming the home of several shows that were produced for The CW network. That article stated that the streaming service signed a deal in 2011 with CBS and Warner Bros. to make The CW's shows available to watch on Netflix. However, Deadline's article revealed that the agreement wasn't being renewed.

Even though the decision not to renew the deal was made years ago, the original agreement ensured Supernatural would remain on Netflix for a long time. According to the terms of the original deal with Warner Bros. and CBS, the shows involved in the agreement had to be exclusive to Netflix for five years after the final season was added. Since Supernatural's final season was added to Netflix in November 2020, that set up the show's upcoming December 2025 departure.

As an article from What's on Netflix outlines, several other CW shows have already left or will depart the streaming service in the months and years to come. Between September 2022 and September 2024, Reign, The Vampire Diaries, Life Sentence, The Originals, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Jane the Virgin, and iZombie all left Netflix. On the same day that Supernatural will be departing, on December 18, 2025, The 100 and Arrow will also be leaving.

Black Lightning and Supergirl will stop being available on Netflix in September and December 2026, respectively. That will be followed by September 2027, marking the end for Legends of Tomorrow, Charmed, and Legacies. December 2027 will be the month Dynasty will no longer be available on Netflix, and The Flash and Riverdale will be gone after November 2028. Finally, the last show to leave the streaming service will be All American in December 2029.

What happens when someone walks into a psychic reading completely against their will? TikToker and medium Jonathan Mark (@jonathanmarkmedium) is sharing the story of how he turned a retired NFL player from a skeptic into a believer. By the end, there wasn't any doubt left in the room.

So, a husband and wife came in for a reading, but the wife clarified that it was just for her husband. She had tricked her husband into coming under the guise that the reading was for both of them.

This guy was a retired NFL player and towered at least six feet and five inches tall.  He was definitely not Jonathan's typical client base.

He tried to get out of it, saying that he didn't believe in psychics and mediums, but she urged him to give it a chance. So, he reluctantly sat down with Jonathan and did the reading.

During the session, Jonathan mentioned his mother and brought up specific details before she passed away. They were the kind of details that could not have been known publicly.

Jonathan also referred to private things about his family, particularly his father, and revealed a family secret.

“Mind you, the entire time, he hasn't said one thing,” said Jonathan.

“The reading's done, he stands up and starts crying, hugs me, and goes, ‘This was the best thing I could ever experience.' He said he didn't know what to expect, and he's blown away, and he's been coming to me ever since.”

He walked away completely changed. Many TikTok users in the comments section admitted that they had always wanted to see a medium but were afraid of being disappointed or scammed.

“Part of me has always wanted to go to a medium to make sure my brother is okay. We lost him suddenly 24 years ago, and it just hurts still. But I guess I'm skeptical,” commented one user.

“I was a skeptic until I saw someone who gave me the name of my ex. I was visiting a different state in a town where I knew no one,” stated another.

“I've always wanted a reading since my daughter passed away, but I struggle with believing people, but I have always felt like she has a message for me! I believe my guardian angels warned me she was going to die, but I just thought it was a nightmare until she passed away,” wrote a third.

Overall, Jonathan's story highlights how powerful the idea of connection can be, especially for those dealing with grief and loss. Moments like these can offer comfort and closure in ways that plain ol' logic can't provide. It's not about convincing people; it's about creating space for healing and communication.

Tucker Carlson is currently in the middle of a political firestorm. The once titanic Fox News personality, now a massively popular podcaster, managed to destabilize the entire MAGA movement in late October by hosting a warm conversation with white nationalist Nick Fuentes, the leader of a nihilistic and hateful right-wing youth movement. The Republican Party's commentariat class is still furiously debating the Fuentes interview, but Carlson has blithely moved on to conducting interviews about A.I. girlfriends and George Santos' prison exploits.

But Carlson's dedication to proving his “open-mindedness,” at least when it comes to certain kinds of ideas, has persisted. On Monday, he reiterated this by releasing an episode of his podcast dedicated to an exciting new topic: chemtrails.

The episode was titled “US Government Admits Chemtrails Are Real (It's Worse Than You Think).” It was a conversation with Dane Wigington, a conspiracy theorist who appears to have dedicated his professional career to exposing the government's secret use of chemtrails—toxic chemicals being deposited into the skies, in long wispy trails, by aircraft. The details of the chemtrails conspiracy theory vary, but Carlson's guest focused on a version of the theory in which the chemicals are used to seize control of the weather for both practical aims and more sinister purposes. “Destabilize the food supply by destabilizing the rain, and you destabilize the population,” the show's expert guest says at one point.

“Chemtrails” aren't real, and the “contrails” you see coming out of airplanes are largely water vapor. Nevertheless, the belief in chemtrails has been around since at least the 1990s, but it appears to have experienced a resurgence in popularity over the past year, thanks to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s MAHA movement.

This episode seems to be Carlson's first foray into the world of chemtrail conspiracy theories, but his arrival at the topic unfolded not by accident: At the start of the episode, he says that his team had spent six months trying to find a “serious, sane person with an engineering background” for the subject.

And in some ways, Carlson's amplification of chemtrail beliefs makes sense. If you believe that the government is manipulating the weather, you don't have to grapple with the real causes of climate change—and ways to address it that don't fit into your ideological box. It's a new form of climate denial for an era in which climate change is undeniable. There may be superstorms and megafires, the thinking goes, but the solution isn't a carbon tax or a push for green energy. As is often the case, the solution is to overthrow the deep-state cabal. Carlson has long preached climate denial, even back in his neocon–bow tie incarnation. And in explaining erratic climate patterns by pointing to a nefarious weather program—rather than the human-caused crisis scientists have for decades been begging the globe to address—Carlson doesn't have to admit to being wrong.

It seems inevitable that many on the right would embrace it, particularly as the movement has devolved deeper into conspiracy theories since Donald Trump's ascendancy and the COVID pandemic.

Of course, none of that is how Carlson and Co. are framing their embrace of chemtrails. In the episode, the conspiracy theory is presented as a nonpartisan exploration of science. Wigington, the guest, has some old-fashioned West Coast–granola qualities. He speaks of being a steward of the planet and of the collapse of the bee population. At one point, he remarks wistfully that forests don't smell the way they used to. Coming from Wigington, chemtrails seem like another environmental cause, with villains in the defense corporations and the U.S. military.

But the real core of Wigington's theory is that chemtrails, deposited by the U.S. government for slightly amorphous aims, serve to diffuse radiation from the sun—this may be well intentioned but shortsighted, he argues—and play a role in weather modification. These latter projects, which he describes as “the crown jewel weapon with which they can, have been, and are bringing populations to their knees,” can help redirect storms, trigger droughts, and shape weather patterns at the continental level. More importantly, the chemtrails themselves, by poisoning the atmosphere, are ultimately a kind of existential threat to all life on Earth. As Wigington notes at one point during the episode, “It's virtually dismantling the planet's primary life-support systems and ubiquitously contaminating everything everywhere.”

This is all very ominous, and Carlson accepts Wigington's assertions as truth. The host was primed, based on his own observations, to deduce that something highly suspicious was going on. As he says of contrails in the episode, “I don't remember them as a child.” He describes the basic query—what are those lines in the sky?—as “one of the questions that's been the most discouraged over the past 30 years.” The official answer can't be right, he says, because it just doesn't make sense.

There is one factor Carlson mentions that helps explain this new milestone in his journey away from typical political discourse: the pandemic. “It would be hard for my middle-aged brain to accept a lie at this scale. How could you do that? How could you hide something this big, this profound, from an entire population?” Carlson says in the episode. “Except I just saw it five years ago with the COVID vax, which was, like, a total lie. … So I know for a fact what you're describing is possible.”

Carlson may represent a substantial number of people here, in bringing a post-COVID conspiracy mindset to the real problem of a changing climate. After the fires in Hawaii and California in recent years, some tossed around ideas about space lasers. Chemtrails allow for a more unified theory of the global climate crisis, explaining wildfires, hurricanes, droughts, flooding, and erratic weather. In the episode, Wigington credits secret geoengineering for the Palisades fire, flash flooding in Texas, freezes along the Gulf Coast, and Hurricane Helene.

But Carlson is not a powerless consumer of content: He is a highly influential figure for conservative America, and he spent years undermining the public's trust in climate science. In an ironic twist, Carlson appears to come around to the idea of human-caused climate change in this discussion, but only if the humans are not on his side. In the end, it's the military, but also the media, covering it up, as well as, crucially, the scientists and environmental activists who are playing God by trying to tamper with the climate in the name of fighting global warming.

Carlson is not the only political figure to have picked up this issue. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has discussed her concerns about chemtrails. Kennedy has accused the Defense Department of being behind them. Florida and Tennessee have passed laws banning geoengineering and weather modification, based on chemtrail conspiracy theories. Other state legislatures have proposed similar laws. When these conversations first popped up in the news, many laughed it off as ridiculous. But Carlson's show, beyond platforming a facile scientific theory, demonstrates the staying power of the conspiracy mindset in the post-COVID world, beyond the realm of medicine. As Carlson notes, once you're radicalized to believe that the entire world is lying to you, it's not much of a leap to think the government controls the weather.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Trump is not going to COP30 in Brazil, but America is","https://www.dw.com/en/trump-is-not-going-to-cop30-in-brazil-but-america-is/a-74662940","Wed, 12 Nov 2025 04:33:48 GMT","

The Trump administration has trivialized COP30, and is not sending anyone to the climate talks in Belem. But local and regional leaders from across the US want the world to know they're not giving up.

Washington is not sending a top-level team to this year's COP climate summit in Belem, Brazil.

The global community expected as much from a president who has pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement for the second time, slashed funding for renewable energy, championed fossil fuel projects and told world leaders at the UN in September that climate change is the ""greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.""

But delegates from Washington state, along with governors, mayors and other representatives from states and cities across the US, are determined to pick up the slack. Together, they represent about two-thirds of the US population and produce nearly three-quarters of the country's economic output.

""It's a long way to come from Seattle to Rio, but I made the trip, and others made the trip, because it's important for the rest of the world not to give up on the United States,"" said Jay Inslee, the former Democratic governor of Washington. Inslee was speaking to DW from Rio de Janeiro, where he was taking part in pre-COP events last week ahead of the main climate talks.

""The United States have not pulled out of Paris. One part of the United States has, and that's the federal government,"" said Inslee, a founding member of the US Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of governors that includes 23 states and one territory. The group was spurred into action during the first Trump presidency in 2017.

""It's very important that we not allow a misperception to exist that somehow progress has stopped because we have a bloviating, anti-wind turbine, climate-denying narcissist in the White House. That's a very important message, I think, for the world to give them confidence to move forward.""

Speaking in Belem, California's Governor Gavin Newsom told AFP any future Democratic president would rejoin the Paris Agreement ""without hesitation,"" adding that it's both a ""moral commitment"" and an ""economic imperative.""  

""It's an abomination that he has twice, not once, pulled away from the accords,"" Newsom said. ""Donald Trump is doubling down on stupid.""  

While Trump's team is not expected in Belem, some observers are concerned the president could disrupt the negotiations from afar.  

""The signal sent to countries around the world is that the US may penalize in trade terms countries that take stronger climate action,"" said Maha Rafi Atal, an associate professor in political economy at the University of Glasgow in Scotland.

She told DW in an email that Trump's hostility to climate action could see other countries ""less willing to prioritize emissions reductions over economic growth"" and funding the energy transition.

""Yes, the [US] federal government may continue to be disruptive,"" said Gina McCarthy, co-chair of America Is All In (AIAI), a climate action coalition, in an email. ""Our delegation is focused on what we know for sure: local leaders and businesses across the United States are pressing forward on clean energy and are eager to collaborate with international partners to strengthen the Paris Agreement.""

More than 100 subnational leaders from the US Climate Alliance, Climate Mayors and AIAI — representing state and city officials as well as tribal nations, businesses, schools and other institutions — are taking part in the high-stakes negotiations in the Amazon, which run from November 10 to 21.

While many of the decisions at COP shape how nations tackle climate change at the federal level, the local leaders believe the US, the world's second-biggest polluter after China, can still meet the goals of the 2015 Paris accord and reach net-zero emissions by mid-century. Even with Trump boosting oil and gas projects, which contribute significantly to global warming.

""[Trump] often talks and makes a lot of noise, but he cannot stop us moving forward,"" said Inslee. ""Yes, he has reduced some of our federal efforts, but we retain the ability to control our own destiny in these states and cities.""

In fact, an analysis released by AIAI last month shows that expanded climate action on the local level, along with renewed support from Washington after 2028 — when Trump is due to leave office — could see the US reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 56% below 2005 levels by 2035. Under the Biden administration, the US 2035 pledge was to cut net emissions by up to 66%.

Many of those reductions in the coming years would come from local policy changes in three key areas: electricity, transportation and reducing methane emissions from leaky gas infrastructure and organic waste.

""Our findings show that innovative local policies and market-driven clean technology investments can keep the US on a path toward significant emissions reductions, even in challenging times,"" said Nate Hultman, director at the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland, which led the study.

Speaking at the COP30 Local Leaders Forum last week, McCarthy — a climate adviser for the Biden administration and former head of the Environmental Protection Agency — told attendees that ""change happens from the bottom up.""

She said local efforts were ""leading the charge on clean energy,"" pointing out that the 24 states in the US Climate Alliance had already managed to collectively reduce greenhouse gas emission by 24% below 2005 levels, while increasing their GDP by 34%.

""They're supported by the majority of Americans that want their leaders to lower energy costs, protect public health and create jobs,"" McCarthy told DW.

Inslee, whose policies on clean energy, energy-efficient building and low-emission transportation as governor of Washington from 2013 to 2025 helped shape Joe Biden's approach to climate change, said job creation and economic growth could go hand-in-hand with reducing emissions.

Even in states like Texas, which is not a part of the US Climate Alliance, renewable energy is taking off because, as Inslee put it, Americans ""want cheaper sources of energy."" Texas, where voters backed Trump in the last three elections, leads the US when it comes to the development of renewable energy generation and battery capacity. Average electricity prices in the southern state are among the lowest in the country, according to August data from the US Energy Information Administration, a government agency.

Through their participation at COP, McCarthy told attendees in Rio that local leaders were looking to build partnerships and inform negotiations in Belem.

""We have power, we have agency, we have authority, and damn it, we are going to use it!"" she said to applause.

Approval of the way President Donald Trump is managing the government has dropped sharply since earlier this year with discontent rising from fellow Republicans.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Approval of the way President Donald Trump is managing the government has dropped sharply since early in his second term, according to a new AP-NORC poll, with much of the rising discontent coming from fellow Republicans.

The survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research was conducted after Democrats' recent victories in off-year elections but before Congress took major steps to try to end the longest shutdown in U.S. history. It shows that only 33% of U.S. adults approve of the way the Republican president is managing the government, down from 43% in an AP-NORC poll from March.

That was driven in large part by a decline in approval among Republicans and independents. According to the survey, only about two-thirds of Republicans, 68%, said they approve of Trump's government management, down from 81% in March. Independents' approval dropped from 38% to 25%.




The results highlight the risks posed by the shutdown, which Trump and his administration have tried to pin squarely on Democrats, even as U.S. adults have cast blame on both parties as the funding lapse has snarled air traffic, left hundreds of thousands of federal workers without paychecks and compromised food aid for some of the most vulnerable Americans. But it could also indicate broader discontent with Trump's other dramatic — and polarizing — changes to the federal government in recent months, including gutting agencies and directing waves of mass layoffs.




Republicans have generally been steadfast in their support for the president, making their growing displeasure particularly notable.

“I'm thoroughly disturbed by the government shutdown for 40-something days,” said Beverly Lucas, 78, a Republican and retired educator who lives in Ormond Beach, Florida, and compared Trump's second term to “having a petulant child in the White House, with unmitigated power.”

“When people are hungry, he had a party,” she said, referring to a Great Gatsby-themed Halloween party held at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. “I thought he seems callous.”

The survey found an overwhelming majority of Democrats, 95%, continue to disapprove of Trump's management of the federal government, compared with 89% in March.

Even with the decline in support for his management of the government, Trump's overall approval rating has remained steady in the new poll. About one-third of U.S. adults, 36%, approve of his overall handling of the presidency, roughly in line with 37% in an October AP-NORC poll. Approval of his handling of key issues like immigration and the economy have also barely changed since last month.




Health care emerged as a key issue in the shutdown debate as Democrats demanded that Republicans negotiate with them to extend tax credits that expire Jan. 1. But Trump's approval on the issue, which was already fairly low, has barely changed.

About one-third, 34%, of Americans said they approved of Trump's handling of health care in the November poll, compared with 31% in October. 

And many of his supporters are still behind him. Susan McDuffie, 74, a Republican who lives in Carson City, Nevada, and retired several years ago, said she has “great confidence in Trump” and thinks the country is on the right track. She blames Democrats for the shutdown and the suffering it's caused.

“I just don't understand how the Democrats can care so little about the people,” she said, scoffing at the idea that Democrats were trying to use the shutdown to force Republicans to address soon-to-skyrocket health care costs.

“I don't have any patience for the Democrats and their lame excuses,” she said, arguing that people who are scared about SNAP benefits expiring and struggling to put food on the table are a more pressing issue. 

When it comes to the shutdown, there is still plenty of blame to go around. Recent polls have indicated that while Republicans may be taking slightly more heat, many think Democrats are at fault, too.

“I truly do believe it's everybody. Everybody is being stubborn,” said Nora Bailey, 33, a moderate who lives in the Batesville area in Arkansas and does not align with either party.

After recently giving birth, she said, she faced delays in getting a breast pump through a government program that helps new mothers while her son was in intensive care. And she is worried about her disabled parents, who rely on SNAP food stamp benefits.

Overall, she said she is mixed on Trump's handling of the job and disapproves of his management of the federal government because she believes he has not gone far enough to tackle waste.

“I don't see enough being done yet to tell me we have downsized the federal government instead of having all these excess people,” she said.

It's possible that Trump's approval on handling the federal government will rebound if the government reopens. But the showdown could have a more lasting impact on perceptions of the president, whose approval on the economy and immigration has eroded slightly since the spring.

Lucas, the Florida Republican, said shutdowns in which civilians aren't paid are the wrong way to address ideological disagreement.

“Air traffic controllers? Really? You want to not pay the people in whose hands your lives are every day?” she said. “We need to be addressing these conflicts like intelligent people and not thugs and bullies on the playground.”

LONDON (AP) — He's lost his titles, his house and his reputation, but the former Prince Andrew has gained a hyphen.

The disgraced royal is now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and not – as previously announced – Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.

The change makes the name's style conform to the double-barreled surname chosen by the late Queen Elizabeth II for her descendants 65 years ago.

It combines the royal family's name of Windsor, chosen by King George V in 1917, with Mountbatten, the surname of the queen's husband, Prince Philip.

The queen had initially decided to use Windsor alone, leading her husband to complain that he was the only man in England not allowed to give his children his name.

Elizabeth relented, and in an official declaration on Feb. 8, 1960 — days before her son Andrew was born — said: “My descendants other than descendants enjoying the style title or attribute of Royal Highness and the titular dignity of Prince or Princess and female descendants who marry and their descendants shall bear the name of Mountbatten-Windsor.”

The hyphen has been added after palace officials studied the 1960 declaration.

King Charles III announced on Oct. 30 that he was removing his brother's titles and evicting him from his royal residence near Windsor Castle over his relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Pressure had been growing on the palace to oust the 65-year-old prince from his Royal Lodge home over new revelations about his friendship with Epstein and renewed attention on sexual abuse allegations by one of Epstein's victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, whose posthumous memoir was published last month.

The king went even further to punish Mountbatten-Windsor for serious lapses of judgment by removing the title of prince that he had held since birth.

Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied Giuffre's allegations.

A fired executive at WPP is suing the advertising agency giant, accusing the company of retaliating against him and firing him after he raised concerns that the group's media investment division was allegedly running an improper kickback operation.

Richard Foster spent 17 years working for GroupM, WPP's media arm, which controls more than $60 billion in advertising spending for clients such as Google, Unilever, and Ford. GroupM rebranded to become WPP Media this year.

Foster was formerly the global chief executive of Motion Content Group, a division of GroupM/WPP Media that produces and co-finances TV series such as ""Love Island"" and brokers other entertainment partnerships.

The lawsuit says that Foster grew increasingly concerned about a practice within GroupM's trading division known as ""volume-based discounts."" GroupM would leverage the power of its billions of dollars in client ad budgets to secure incentives from media owners — such as cash rebates or free or discounted inventory — but not always disclose or pass these back to clients, the lawsuit alleges.

In short, Foster alleges in the suit that WPP had created a hidden way of generating profit and wasn't acting in the interest of its advertiser clients. He claims that when he brought this to top management, the agency group reacted by firing him rather than investigating his concerns.

Receiving media rebates isn't illegal in the US. That said, the ad industry has previously been warned by legal experts that rebates could amount to a breach of contract or even fraud if not disclosed to the client or if advertisers were deceived about the practice. Public companies are required to accurately record all income, including rebates, in their financial statements.

""The scale of this purchasing power enabled GroupM to leverage their client spend to force many ad-supported television and media platforms to give GroupM discounts, which, rather than being passed back to clients, GroupM turned into a non-disclosed profit center,"" Foster's lawsuit says.

The lawsuit says Foster estimated that over the past five years, GroupM generated between $3 billion and $4 billion by striking rebate-driven deals, of which the agency improperly retained approximately $1.5 to $2 billion. The suit doesn't provide further documentation to support this claim.

""The Company is aware of a lawsuit in the New York State Court filed by a former employee who was let go in a recent organizational restructuring,"" said a WPP spokesperson in a statement. ""The court has not yet made any findings in relation to the allegations and we will defend them vigorously.""

The topic of agency kickbacks set a dark cloud over the ad industry a decade ago. In 2015, Jon Mandel, a former WPP media agency exec, gave a presentation at a marketing conference that alleged agency rebates and kickbacks were a widespread practice in the US. The following year, the Association of National Advertisers, a US trade body, published a bombshell report by the corporate investigations firm K2 Intelligence, which alleged rebates and other non-transparent business practices were ""pervasive"" among US media agencies. Big agency groups at the time slammed the report as inflammatory, criticized its methodology, and broadly denied wrongdoing.

In reaction to the report, some advertisers renegotiated their contracts or audited their media agencies to push for more transparency. In 2018, federal prosecutors in Manhattan initiated an investigation into media-buying practices in the US, The Wall Street Journal reported, though no criminal charges have been brought.

Foster's lawsuit catapults the controversial rebates issue into the present day. It comes at a rocky time for WPP, which has said it expects to report a second consecutive annual revenue decline this year. The company's share price has more than halved in the year to date, with the group having lost key media accounts, including many in the US, to rivals such as Publicis Groupe and Omnicom.

Foster said he repeatedly raised concerns over the years with senior WPP and GroupM executives, including Nicola McCormick, WPP's general counsel for media, that rebate deals were unethical and posed a significant legal risk to the company, the lawsuit alleges.

In October 2024, Brian Lesser, the newly appointed global CEO of GroupM, requested a meeting with Foster and asked him for a ""candid assessment"" of the division's operations, including any potential issues, the lawsuit says. Foster says he also detailed his recommendations to develop a new WPP Entertainment division, to build on what he had achieved with Motion Content Group.

Upon Lesser's request, Foster submitted a 35-page report after the meeting that included a section outlining his concerns about GroupM's rebate practices, the lawsuit says.

Foster estimated in the report that GroupM derived nearly $1 billion in global net sales from ""non-product-related income,"" such as rebates and ""purchase risk"" media deals. In ""purchase risk deals,"" the agency would use its collective client spending power to buy large blocks of advertising inventory upfront to obtain pricing discounts, and then sell it back to clients through opt-in agreements.

Foster claims many large advertisers were opposed to such deals because they were designed to benefit an agency's bottom line rather than the client's.

The suit appears to describe a form of what's known in the industry as principal media buying, so-called because by buying inventory and reselling it to clients, agencies act as a ""principal,"" or vendor. A report published last year by the ANA found that principal media buying was on the rise at holding companies due to downward pressure on agency margins and a push from marketers to bring down media prices. The report found that principal media can save advertisers between 10% and 15% in media costs, but some marketers had concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the quality of the media they were purchasing.

The lawsuit says that in a phone call with Foster in January of this year, Lesser initially expressed concerns about potential risks tied to such deals, but later asked him via text to reproduce a ""sanitized"" version of his report to exclude any overt criticism of GroupM's trading operations. Unbeknownst to Foster, Lesser had already sent a copy of the original report to Mark Patterson, the executive responsible for GroupM's trading activities. Patterson is currently WPP Media's global president of markets and business operations.

Hours after that text, the suit says, Foster was ""blindsided"" by a restructure announcement that saw the sports and entertainment divisions report directly to Patterson. The following day, Patterson's role was changed to global president, with responsibility for the APAC and LATAM regions and the entertainment and sport divisions.

Foster alleges in the lawsuit that he was then immediately excluded from key meetings, cut out of deals, and isolated from decision-making. In July, GroupM terminated Foster without cause, the lawsuit says.

""At no point did WPP or WPP Media conduct a formal review or investigation into Foster's reports, as required under their compliance policies and applicable whistleblower protection laws, nor was corrective action ever taken,"" the lawsuit says.

The lawsuit, filed in the New York State Supreme Court, is seeking more than $100 million in damages for charges of retaliation, wrongful termination, and violations of whistleblower protection laws. William A. Brewer III, partner at Brewer, Attorneys & Counselors, is lead counsel to Foster.

Correction: November 12, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated the lawsuit's characterization of Foster's conversation with former WPP CEO Mark Read. It also misstated a change of roles within the company. Patterson's role, not Foster's, was changed to global president, with responsibility for the APAC and LATAM regions and the entertainment and sport divisions.

The Brazilian government proposed a law to allow the sale of bitcoin BTC$101,341.64 and other cryptocurrencies seized during criminal investigations at a time when the nation appears to be cracking down on organized crime.

Bill 5.582/2025, sent to Congress by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, would authorize financial institutions to liquidate cryptocurrencies even before trial outcomes, just as foreign currencies, checks and securities are treated. What happens if suspects are later acquitted isn't clear.

Officials said the measure is intended to hit gangs where it hurts: their wallets, and is part of a broader ""anti-faction bill"" that amends legislation on criminal organizations and Brazil's code of criminal procedure. It is aimed at the financial infrastructure of gangs like Comando Vermelho, one of the country's most powerful criminal factions, 

The timing of the proposal is notable. It comes days after a major police operation in Rio's favelas left 121 people dead, most of them alleged gang members, in what is now the country's deadliest police raid.

Authorities said the raid targeted leaders of Comando Vermelho and involved more than 2,500 officers.

The push to liquidate seized crypto assets is unfolding alongside a major regulatory overhaul by Brazil's central bank. The central bank released new rules requiring crypto companies to be licensed and to hold capital reserves ranging from 10.8 million ($2 million) to 37.2 million reais, depending on their activities.

The rules, which take effect in February, classify a wide range of crypto activities under Brazil's foreign exchange and capital markets laws.

They require firms to report international transactions, including stablecoin payments and transfers to self-custody wallets, and place a $100,000 cap on each transaction involving foreign exchange.

The anti-faction bill is under urgent consideration in Congress and must be voted on by Dec. 18.

iPhone and Apple Watch owners in the United States will now be able to carry a copy of their U.S. passport on their device, which they can then use at TSA checkpoints across more than 250 U.S. airports when traveling domestically. 

The feature, known as Digital ID, was previously announced as part of the iOS 26 release, and adds passports to the list of existing government IDs supported in Apple Wallet. The company has rolled out the feature to a dozen states and Puerto Rico, with more on the way.

Using Digital ID in Apple Wallet, users can create and present an ID, even if they don't have a REAL ID-compliant driver's license or state ID. The ID does not replace a physical passport, and it's not currently supported for international travel or crossing borders, Apple notes.

Users can add their passport to Wallet by tapping on the “Add” (+) button in the Wallet app, then selecting “Driver's License or ID Cards.” From there, select Digital ID and follow the steps to complete the setup process, which includes using the iPhone to scan the photo page of their passport and scanning the chip embedded on the back to ensure the passport's authenticity. Users will also have to take a selfie for verification and then complete a series of facial and head movements for additional security.

Support for IDs in Apple Wallet is the last obstacle standing in the way of making iPhones a replacement for a physical wallet, as it can now hold payment cards, loyalty cards, tickets and passes, and more.

Presenting Apple's new Digital ID in person works much like using Apple Pay. You can double-click the side button or Home button to access your Wallet, then select Digital ID. The iPhone or Apple Watch should be held near an identity reader, and users will use Face ID or Touch ID to authenticate their information. Users will also be able to see what identity information is being requested before completing the verification process.

The feature is still in beta as it hasn't fully rolled out to all the device readers at the TSA checkpoints at this time. (The TSA website offers a list of which states are currently supporting mobile ID, but still advises travelers to carry their physical ID.)

Apple says that users will eventually be able to present their Digital ID at businesses and organizations where they need to verify their age, both in-person and online.

This could include event venues or bars, where users need to present their ID at the door to verify if they're of drinking age. Online, websites that restrict content to adults could also leverage Apple's APIs to verify users' ages. For instance, if a user wanted to order alcohol for delivery through a service like Uber Eats, they could verify their ID during the ordering process.

In both cases, users would be able to confirm that their age is over 21 without having to also share personal information like their name, address or birthday. 

Apple said it can't see when or where a user presents their ID or what data was shared. Plus, users don't have to unlock their phone or hand it over to present their ID, as it works just like Apple Pay.

Ben Shelton may not have hoped for the start he's had at the Nitto ATP Finals, but his perspective remains as sharp as his serve.

After a narrow three-set defeat to Felix Auger-Aliassime on Wednesday, the 23-year-old American slipped to 0-2 on his debut appearance at the season finale in Turin. Yet even in disappointment, Shelton's optimism and competitiveness shone through.

In a gripping contest defined by bold play and razor-thin margins, Shelton's fearless shotmaking was momentarily tested at 2/4 in the second-set tie-break, when he took a tumble and was left grimacing and limping between points for the remainder of the set.

“I think it should be okay. It was just one of those where it hit really hard on the ground,” Shelton said of his left knee. “It hurt really bad for the next 10, 15 minutes. I wasn't about to stop and call the trainer, then come back and try to serve down a mini-break and stay in the set. I just kept going, maybe [due to] adrenaline. But I didn't feel it at all through the whole third set.”

The fall came at a crucial moment, but Shelton's desire to carry on epitomised his fighting spirit, one that has become a defining trait throughout his 2025 campaign.

The American won his biggest career title at the ATP Masters 1000 in Toronto and reached a career-high No. 5 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Though he has also been tested with adversity, having been forced to retire from the US Open third round due to a shoulder injury.

“If I rated it 1 to 10, maybe an 8 out of 10,” Shelton said when asked to rate his 2025 season. “I made huge improvements and strides from the year before. What I've done post US Open, I haven't been happy with. But the rhythm that I found in the first three quarters of the year was really good.

“I'm a guy that gets into a really good rhythm when I'm playing a lot of matches. I had a lot of clarity this summer on how to play: shot tolerance, what shots to play at certain times. I had a lot of clarity on what my identity was on the court, how I was going to win, my winning formula. I'm still searching for that a little bit right now.""

Upon returning from his injury in Shanghai in October, Shelton has struggled to post the results he was able to before. He notched a 3-3 record between then and arriving in Turin, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

“These last four tournaments of the year - Shanghai, Basel, Paris, here - have been more difficult for me trying to find that 'wow' feeling,” said Shelton. “All the guys that I have played have been in form and playing great tennis, competing well. [There are] certain things that feel very off at this point of the year. It can't be happening.

“For me this week, it's been my forehand, which usually is a money shot for me, money-maker. The first ball after the serve, things that have been a little off that make it disappointing, [but] a lot of things to be happy about this season.”



This week in Turin, Shelton has deployed an aggressive serve-and-volley approach, which was particularly evident against Auger-Aliassime. At 5-5 in the second set, Shelton escaped a nervy Deuce game with consecutive volley winners, which both came from second serves.

“I think it's something that I've always done since I was young [hitting big second serves],” Shelton said when asked of his high second-serve speeds. “I used to hit a lot more double faults and actually be more aggressive on my second serve because I wanted to get a free point on the first serve and second serve.

“That's always been my mentality, a more aggressive mentality. Whenever I'm serving, whether it is first or second, to have an advantage. I think that's the mindset for some guys and it isn't for others. I think if you look at the guys in the Top 10 right now, a lot of guys who go after the second serve have fast second serves that are difficult to deal with.”

After defeats to Alexander Zverev and Auger-Aliassime in Turin this week, Shelton is 0-2 in the Bjorn Borg Group, leaving just a small chance of him qualifying for the semi-finals. Despite this, he is able to draw lessons from the experience and admits that it usually takes him a few appearances to find his feet at tournaments.

“I'm just excited to be here, the opportunity,” said Shelton. “[It's] not the best week for me so far. Obviously that is frustrating and disappointing, being as big of a tournament as it is. Historically I haven't been the person who's come to a new place, a new tournament, and just been outstanding right away. I think there's a bit of a learning curve everywhere you go.

“For me it's just back to work regardless of how things end here, [to] be proud about the season that I had and the things that I accomplished. Let the things sting that I wasn't able to accomplish and that I fell short on. It will just motivate me for next year.”

The K-pop girl group had attempted to break away from the label after the firing of mentor Min Hee-jin.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	After losing their legal battle against ADOR, the members of NewJeans have decided to resume activities with the label.


	On Wednesday (Nov. 12), ADOR announced that K-pop stars Haerin and Hyein had agreed to continue working with the HYBE subsidiary after “thoughtful consideration with their respective families and thorough discussions” about how to move forward.


	“The two members have decided to respect the court's latest ruling and adhere to their exclusive contract with the label,” the company wrote in a statement shared with Billboard. “ADOR is committed to providing its full support to HAERIN and HYEIN to ensure the seamless continuation of their artistic endeavors.” 

	











	“We request the warm support from the fans and respectfully urge you to avoid engaging in unfounded speculation regarding the members,” ADOR added.


	Other outlets are reporting that the remaining members, Minji, Hanni and Danielle, have also agreed to continue working with the label. Billboard has reached out to HYBE for comment.


	News of NewJeans' return comes a year after the members first announced plans to leave ADOR and release music independently, alleging that the label had violated their contract by firing their mentor, former CEO Min Hee-jin. This past October, a Korean judge sided with ADOR's stance that the termination of Min was not sufficient grounds to void the band's contract, upholding that NewJeans may not pursue any independent activities until 2029.


	“We sincerely hope that today's judgment, which comes after long-term verification of various claims and facts and reaffirms prior rulings, will serve as an opportunity for the artists to calmly reflect on this matter,” ADOR said in a statement following its victory. “As we stated during the trial, we have completed preparations for the artist's activities, including the release of a studio album, and are waiting. We will do our utmost to return to the fans through discussions with the artist.”

	











	Since forming in 2022, NewJeans has released a number of singles and two EPs, including 2nd EP ‘Get Up', which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. The group has also charted five songs on the Billboard Hot 100.


	In 2025, Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein began releasing music and performing under the name “NJZ.” They were ordered to stop doing so after ADOR filed a preliminary injunction, and in June, they were each fined $734,000 for “unauthorized activities.”

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Scary Movie 6 has added Damon Wayans Jr. (New Girl), Kim Wayans (In Living Color), and Heidi Gardner to its cast, setting two franchise vets to return: Gardner's fellow SNL alum Cheri Oteri and Chris Elliott.


	Character details for the newcomers to the Miramax horror spoof franchise are under wraps. It's unclear whether Oteri and Elliott will reprise past roles or take on new ones — given the nature of these films, anything is possible. Oteri previously appeared in the first Scary Movie in 2000 as Gail Halstorm, a sensationalist television reporter parodying Courteney Cox's Scream character Gale Weathers. Elliott is remembered for playing Hanson, the creepy haunted mansion caretaker from 2001's Scary Movie 2, though he also appeared in 2006's Scary Movie 4 as a different character — Ezekiel, a village loon.
