                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When astronomers first spotted the fast-moving object 3I/ATLAS hurtling through the solar system in July 2025, speculation erupted online: was it another ʻOumuamua—or even an alien craft? Months of data from NASA, JWST, and global observatories now provide a clear answer. 3I/ATLAS is indeed interstellar, but it's not extraterrestrial technology—it's a naturally formed, billion-year-old comet from another star system. Almost immediately, Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb suggested that its unusual motion and brightness could hint at artificial propulsion. The idea spread quickly across social media, echoing his earlier claims about ʻOumuamua. But as new data arrived, that theory began to unravel. Scientists detected radio emissions consistent with cometary outgassing, not engineered transmissions, as reported by LiveScience. Subsequent James Webb Space Telescope observations revealed an unusually high carbon-dioxide to water ratio (CO₂/H₂O ≈ 8 ± 1)—among the highest recorded in any comet. This ratio, astronomers say, reflects the extreme environment in which it formed, not alien machinery. Further analysis using polarimetric imaging found a 'deep negative polarisation branch'—a scattering pattern unseen in ordinary asteroids but consistent with fine, porous dust from interstellar comets. Even rumours of a post-perihelion explosion were dismissed; LiveScience confirmed the object remained intact. With only three known interstellar visitors ever recorded, the cosmic rarity alone fuelled public imagination. Anomalous-looking features—such as faint acceleration, odd tail direction, and slowly fading brightness—added to the intrigue. As Newsweek noted, social media's appetite for extraterrestrial mystery amplified every ambiguous observation. Yet, each anomaly found a natural explanation once more data became available. Far from disappointing, the real story of 3I/ATLAS is even more compelling. According to arXiv analyses, its surface is coated by a 15–20 metre-thick crust formed by billions of years of cosmic-ray exposure—potentially making it 7 billion years old, predating our own Sun. Each new observation has transformed initial wonder into a deeper understanding of how planetary systems form beyond our own.</p>

Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily. Tucker Carlson is currently in the middle of a political firestorm. The once titanic Fox News personality, now a massively popular podcaster, managed to destabilize the entire MAGA movement in late October by hosting a warm conversation with white nationalist Nick Fuentes, the leader of a nihilistic and hateful right-wing youth movement. The Republican Party's commentariat class is still furiously debating the Fuentes interview, but Carlson has blithely moved on to conducting interviews about A.I. But Carlson's dedication to proving his “open-mindedness,” at least when it comes to certain kinds of ideas, has persisted. On Monday, he reiterated this by releasing an episode of his podcast dedicated to an exciting new topic: chemtrails. The episode was titled “US Government Admits Chemtrails Are Real (It's Worse Than You Think).” It was a conversation with Dane Wigington, a conspiracy theorist who appears to have dedicated his professional career to exposing the government's secret use of chemtrails—toxic chemicals being deposited into the skies, in long wispy trails, by aircraft. Nevertheless, the belief in chemtrails has been around since at least the 1990s, but it appears to have experienced a resurgence in popularity over the past year, thanks to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s MAHA movement. This episode seems to be Carlson's first foray into the world of chemtrail conspiracy theories, but his arrival at the topic unfolded not by accident: At the start of the episode, he says that his team had spent six months trying to find a “serious, sane person with an engineering background” for the subject. And in some ways, Carlson's amplification of chemtrail beliefs makes sense. If you believe that the government is manipulating the weather, you don't have to grapple with the real causes of climate change—and ways to address it that don't fit into your ideological box. There may be superstorms and megafires, the thinking goes, but the solution isn't a carbon tax or a push for green energy. Carlson has long preached climate denial, even back in his neocon–bow tie incarnation. Wigington, the guest, has some old-fashioned West Coast–granola qualities. At one point, he remarks wistfully that forests don't smell the way they used to. But the real core of Wigington's theory is that chemtrails, deposited by the U.S. government for slightly amorphous aims, serve to diffuse radiation from the sun—this may be well intentioned but shortsighted, he argues—and play a role in weather modification. These latter projects, which he describes as “the crown jewel weapon with which they can, have been, and are bringing populations to their knees,” can help redirect storms, trigger droughts, and shape weather patterns at the continental level. More importantly, the chemtrails themselves, by poisoning the atmosphere, are ultimately a kind of existential threat to all life on Earth. As Wigington notes at one point during the episode, “It's virtually dismantling the planet's primary life-support systems and ubiquitously contaminating everything everywhere.” This is all very ominous, and Carlson accepts Wigington's assertions as truth. The host was primed, based on his own observations, to deduce that something highly suspicious was going on. There is one factor Carlson mentions that helps explain this new milestone in his journey away from typical political discourse: the pandemic. “It would be hard for my middle-aged brain to accept a lie at this scale. “Except I just saw it five years ago with the COVID vax, which was, like, a total lie. … So I know for a fact what you're describing is possible.” Chemtrails allow for a more unified theory of the global climate crisis, explaining wildfires, hurricanes, droughts, flooding, and erratic weather. But Carlson is not a powerless consumer of content: He is a highly influential figure for conservative America, and he spent years undermining the public's trust in climate science. In an ironic twist, Carlson appears to come around to the idea of human-caused climate change in this discussion, but only if the humans are not on his side. Carlson is not the only political figure to have picked up this issue. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has discussed her concerns about chemtrails. Kennedy has accused the Defense Department of being behind them. When these conversations first popped up in the news, many laughed it off as ridiculous. As Carlson notes, once you're radicalized to believe that the entire world is lying to you, it's not much of a leap to think the government controls the weather.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paranormal Activity, one of the most recognizable franchises in modern horror, is about to do something none of the others have ever done. It's coming off the screen and into your reality as part of a brand new stage show. The show is called, simply enough, Paranormal Activity, and after a debut in Chicago earlier this fall, it's opening at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles this week and running through December 7. From there, it'll be at the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, DC, from January 28 through February 7, followed by the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco from February 19 through March 15. Well, io9 sat down with the show's writer, Levi Holloway, to find out. Holloway, best known for the Broadway plays Grey House and Turret, starring Michael Shannon, came on board the project in 2023. It seemed like, ‘Well, that's just an audience. Not sure how, but we could do that.” Before they solved that problem, though, Holloway needed a story. And, thankfully, the franchise's rights holder, Paramount, didn't really interfere with that. “Paramount gave us a very loose mandate,” Holloway said. “The mandate, if anything, was tonal, and it seemed to be more about, like, ‘Okay, well, is it about a couple who are beset by something?' There's a huge leap of faith on their part, which we're so grateful for.” The story that he and Barrett began working on is inspired by, but not narratively linked to, the movies in any way. Instead, it sort of mirrors their journey as creatives. Paranormal Activity is about a couple from Chicago who move to London and realize that places aren't the only thing that can be haunted. “I spent about a year over in London, doing R&D over there, and really started looking at their relationship with ghosts and stuff like that,” he said. It's just that in this sort of Christian structuring of that and the sort of good versus evil, God versus the devil stuff, wasn't really a story that I felt like I had a lot to add to. But I do have a lot to say about ghosts.” Specifically, Holloway found inspiration in the Victorian spiritualist movement, which he felt “really glommed on to this idea of the afterlife and ghosts and mediums and paranormal as a way of processing grief from this massive loss in World War I.” “So that was pretty fertile ground,” he said. “And that was a huge kickoff point for me in terms of storytelling. So you'll see some of those bones very lightly buried throughout the script.” Holloway also found that, in addition to those historical inspirations, simply the idea of this couple moving to a new country helped give the show important staples of the horror genre. “With every good horror story, you try to figure out a way to isolate your characters because the big question is always like, ‘Why don't they run? And for me, the way to do that was, number one, what if places aren't haunted? And then the other way to isolate them is to make them strangers in a strange land, thousands of miles from everything they know.” “One is the restraint of it,” Holloway said. “For huge [amounts] of time in that first film, nothing happens. And it's in that nothing where anything becomes possible. We have this feeling when we're watching a play, people have got to be walking and talking, moving and shaking, you know? But that stillness, that negative space, those durational pauses are where you really start building a kind of electricity and charging an atmosphere with potential. A huge, huge challenge, and something we are always talking about, is how do you submerge the audience in total darkness? But there's also the notion that Paranormal Activity is a found footage-driven franchise. Holloway admitted it would have been easy, and maybe obvious, to make it a more multimedia show with cameras and screens, but, instead, he and Barrett found a new way in. “We wanted to capture that feeling of placing the audience in front of this sawed-off dollhouse and letting them peer into every room and sort of letting them bear witness to something maybe they shouldn't be seeing. And the audience is sort of a voyeur. Because we are voyeurs in this story, it becomes non-theatrical. It feels almost like Rear Window or something. We might as well be given binoculars to look into somebody's house.” All of which, seemingly, could have been done without the name brand of “Paranormal Activity.” But Holloway thinks working within an established franchise was “both a gift and a burden.” “It has a very passionate built-in audience,” he said. It's mostly placing ordinary humans in extraordinary circumstances. You might meet audience members with crossed arms and say, ‘Prove it. For Holloway, that was the biggest dare of Paranormal Activity. Living up to expectations, while also giving audiences something new, exciting, and worthy. “[But] you can't really do that at the theater. You can't bring an audience into a theater and make them think what's happening is real unless you subvert their expectations, which is sort of the whole kit and caboodle for us.” The Paranormal Activity franchise exists because of its sequels, and Holloway admits that while he doesn't want to look too far down the road, that is something he's thought about.

Uniqlo's 'Really Nice Looking' Insulated Parka Is on Sale for $80 Before Black Friday Levi's' Cozy Sherpa-Lined Denim Trucker Jacket Is Now Under $80 at Walmart The beloved paranormal horror-drama series is departing Netflix this December, giving fans a limited window to revisit its epic battles between good and evil. In the modern media landscape, it can feel like there are endless streaming services available for people to choose from. Unfortunately for fans of one of the most popular and beloved paranormal horror-drama shows ever, it is set to leave Netflix soon. Netflix has announced that all 15 seasons of Supernatural will be leaving on December 18, 2025. That means that, as of the time of this writing, fans have just over a month, or 36 days, left to watch the show on Netflix. As an October 2011 Screen Rant article shows, many Supernatural seasons were added to Netflix in January 2012. That timing is interesting since the timing of when Supernatural will be leaving Netflix was decided because of when the final season was added. Since streaming services have forever changed how TV shows are watched, people have become used to seeing series move from one to another. As a result, many people rarely think about what leads to non-original shows becoming available and leaving different streaming services. That article stated that the streaming service signed a deal in 2011 with CBS and Warner Bros. to make The CW's shows available to watch on Netflix. However, Deadline's article revealed that the agreement wasn't being renewed. Since Supernatural's final season was added to Netflix in November 2020, that set up the show's upcoming December 2025 departure. As an article from What's on Netflix outlines, several other CW shows have already left or will depart the streaming service in the months and years to come. That will be followed by September 2027, marking the end for Legends of Tomorrow, Charmed, and Legacies.</p>

So, a husband and wife came in for a reading, but the wife clarified that it was just for her husband. He tried to get out of it, saying that he didn't believe in psychics and mediums, but she urged him to give it a chance. So, he reluctantly sat down with Jonathan and did the reading. During the session, Jonathan mentioned his mother and brought up specific details before she passed away. They were the kind of details that could not have been known publicly. “The reading's done, he stands up and starts crying, hugs me, and goes, ‘This was the best thing I could ever experience.'

Pope Leo XIV blesses a crucifix with incense at the beginning of Mass for the feast of the Body and Blood of Christ outside Rome's Basilica of St. John Lateran in this file photo from June 22, 2025. "The phenomenon of the alleged apparitions said to have taken place in Dozulé is to be regarded, definitively, as not supernatural in origin," Cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández, the prefect, wrote in a letter confirming the judgment of Bishop Jacques Habert of Bayeux-Lisieux, the local bishop. The apparitions were reported by Madeleine Aumont, a Catholic mother of five, who claimed to have seen Jesus and received messages from him four dozen times between 1972 and 1978. A key part of the message was that he allegedly wanted a 24-foot-tall cross to be erected outside town and supposedly said that it would have the same power as the cross on which he was crucified in Jerusalem. But, Cardinal Fernández wrote, "that wood, raised upon Calvary, has become the real sign of Christ's sacrifice, which is unique and unrepeatable." "For this reason, every other 'sign' of the cross -- whether devout or monumental -- cannot be considered on the same plane," he said. "Thus, it seems misleading, both theologically and pastorally-symbolically, to compare 'the Glorious Cross' of Dozulé to the Cross of Jerusalem." However, "the Catholic faith teaches that the power of the cross does not need to be replicated, for it is already present in every Eucharist, in every church, in every believer who lives united to the sacrifice of Christ," Cardinal Fernández wrote. It is about faith not visible signs. Jesus' cross does not need to be constructed of massive amounts of steel or concrete to be recognized, he said. "It is raised every time a heart, moved by grace, opens itself to forgiveness; every time a soul converts; every time hope is rekindled where the situation seemed impossible; and even when, by kissing a small cross, believers entrust themselves to Christ." Even more troubling, he said, were alleged messages that referred "to the remission of sins' through the contemplation of this particular cross" that Jesus supposedly wanted built at Dozulé. The Catholic Church, Cardinal Fernández wrote, "teaches that forgiveness does not proceed from a physical location, but from Christ himself; the remission of sins is received through the sacraments -- in particular, the Sacrament of Penance -- and no material object can replace sacramental grace." "The Cross is indeed a sign of salvation, but a cross that we construct is not, of itself, a place of automatic forgiveness, since forgiveness comes from Christ," he added. "Clearly, this purported prophecy was not fulfilled," the cardinal wrote. "The danger of reducing Christian hope to an expectation of an imminent return with extraordinary events must be firmly avoided." Letters may be edited for length and clarity. The Vatican press office confirmed the Pontifical Swiss Guard is investigating an incident involving one of the guards who has been accused of making an antisemitic gesture.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chart-topping septet PSYCHIC FEVER continue to cement their status as steadily rising act with their latest track “SWISH DAT.” A heavy-hitting production rooted in powerful basslines and sharp lyricism, the track paints a vivid picture of strength and precision. Layering anthemic beats and vibrant imagery with their refreshing musicality, PSYCHIC FEVER continue their momentum following their hit EP and first-ever U.S. tour with this new track which is also the original soundtrack theme for hit Japanese TV show, Masked NINJA Akakage. Three years into their musical journey, PSYCHIC FEVER – consisting of KOKORO, WEESA, TSURUGI, RYOGA, REN, JIMMY, and RYUSHIN –  continue to go from strength to strength with their bold artistry. In conversation with Earmilk, they talk about their latest single, their sonic evolution, memorable moments and genres they'd love to experiment with. KOKORO: This track is themed around ‘Masked NINJA Akakage.' I aimed to capture the silence and intensity of a ninja, blending traditional Japanese elements with hip-hop sounds. WEESA: Since it's a song tied to a drama, we created both the track and the music video to match its concept. We focused on Japanese culture, using themes like ninjas and temples. RYOGA: When we debuted, we explored our individuality and group direction, mainly expressing ourselves through R&B and HIP HOP. Moving forward, while keeping HIP HOP and R&B in mind, we want to challenge ourselves with collaborations that transcend national and cultural boundaries. We also want to cherish our roots in Japanese culture while creating music that resonates with listeners around the world. JIMMY: PSYCHIC FEVER has tried many genres and styles. The result of these experiments can be seen in “PSYCHIC FILE.” After producing many songs since our debut, from this year onward, we want to focus even more on HIP HOP and R&B. TSURUGIi: “SWISH DAT” is a fast-paced, tense track, which I think enhances the mood of the ninja battles depicted in Akakage. RYUSHIN: We challenged ourselves to create a unique atmosphere by blending Japanese elements with the song. Even though it has traditional aspects, it also includes hip-hop elements, creating a daring atmosphere that fits the drama well. If you could experiment with any genre or concepts in the future, what would they be and why? Most of our songs are R&B, and we don't have many opportunities to perform ballads. I think ballads are an essential part of expressing various genres as PSYCHIC FEVER, so I want to challenge myself with them. Since each stage is different in terms of health and environment, it's a challenge every time, so I enjoy performing while testing myself. What's been the most memorable moment of your music journey so far? Until then, we had mainly performed in Japan and Asia, but performing in the U.S. was an invaluable experience for both myself and the team. Most of the audience had never seen our performance before, but they sang and danced along with us, making it a lifelong memory. It was my first time living abroad and performing there. That experience shaped who we are today, so it's an unforgettable moment. JIMMY: The first tours in various locations are very memorable. I think the strength of LDH as a whole is shown through live performances, so I want to refine our sets and lighting overseas to convey our power to the world. Finally, if you describe PSYCHIC FEVER's artistry in 3 words what would they be and why? Each of the seven members has a different personality, but above all, we value the sense of unity as a team. The name of our company, “LDH,” is actually derived from these three words, which are a constant motto for us. Through our music and live entertainment, we want to share these three values with fans all around the world.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Zealand-based genre specialist sales outfit Black Mandala Films is bringing a fresh lineup of horror and thriller titles to the American Film Market (AFM). The lineup features four distinct genre offerings spanning paranormal horror to folk-influenced cosmic dread. Set in 1988, the paranormal thriller follows investigators Mick Sutherland and Archie Charlesworth as they respond to a desperate call from Elizabeth Blair's isolated home, where they encounter a malevolent presence that unravels their sanity over seven days in what becomes known as Case 13. The cast includes Lorenzo Marte, Bill McEwen and Jack Rawlinson. “Beyond the Drumlins,” directed by Dan Bowhers, combines cosmic horror with folk mystery as archaeologists uncover an ancient secret beneath the Irish countryside, awakening something beyond comprehension. The cast features Michael Kowalski, Emma Jessop, Morgan DeTogne, Dan Titmuss and Goodfella Mike G. Filmmaker Gene Dolders brings “The Blade Cuts Deeper,” which fuses giallo aesthetics with contemporary slasher elements. The visually stylized thriller follows a narcissistic TV host who becomes trapped in his own nightmare of televised cruelty and revenge. The anthology is directed by Craig D. Foster, Aleksandr Boikov, Marc Martínez Jordán, Doyeon Noh, Pick Poison, Christer Runde and Felipe Vargas. The project is produced by Michael Kraetzer, Nicolás Onetti and Carlos Goitia.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By this stage, they are more well-thumbed than David Attenborough's passport, and I'm concerned. Secondly, am I somehow unhealthily addicted – if my Pratt records were stolen and she pulled her music from Spotify, how would I cope? Is my mind in a mire of melancholy, mellow, magical Pratt? His illuminating insight assured me that I am not alone. There is a strange psychological quirk to what have become known as ‘comfort' albums. “Familiarity reduces uncertainty, which calms the nervous system,” Dr Swift explains. “Knowing exactly what emotional arc we're about to experience creates a sense of control that becomes predictable. I work from home in the non-too-consequential world of music journalism, so the revelation of latent morning stress would be news to me. But as I found out, there is truth to this for anyone who works from home. Good old time-sapping commutes actually serve a vital human function, preparing you for task-oriented thinking on the way in, and unwinding on the way out. When you simultaneously start your day at home and at work, a strange cognitive dissonance can lead to a build-up of low-level stress. So, in some way, that same old album, podcast, or background playlist is actually a form of self-medication. As Dr Swift explains, “Research shows that repeated exposure to the familiar can reduce cortisol, our primary stress hormone, which explains why comfort media is so often revisited.” Maybe that explains why the effortlessly calming ways of Pratt appeal so endlessly, too. He adds, “This is similar to how habits form as repetition binds the stimulus (music in this instance) and the soothing response together. So, it seemed as though I had been overthinking the threat of staleness, and stressing over nothing – maybe I hadn't been listening to enough Pratt? But…” there was a stinging caveat, “psychology also tells us that when rituals are used to avoid discomfort (for instance, looping the same podcast to block intrusive thoughts), they can become a form of avoidance.” He concludes, “The difference lies in intention: psychological enhancement versus escape.” After a promising start, this felt like a crushing blow to my wintery Pratt cycle – how was I to know whether I was escaping or psychologically enhancing? “Leaning too heavily on one comfort album can narrow our cultural diet, limiting opportunities for novelty, which is crucial for psychological growth,” Dr Dwift damningly declared. “On the other hand,” he thankfully continued, “our ‘go-to' pieces often reveal something essential about what we seek from culture: intimacy, stability, or self-awareness. Research suggests both novelty and familiarity are important for wellbeing, so the healthiest approach is balance – returning to comfort while remaining open to discovery.” We all need our little culture crutches, it would seem, and as long as they're beautiful and meaningful, they're worth giving yourself up to. As Dr Swift concludes, “Our hectic lifestyles make comfort culture particularly appealing. When we are bombarded with news, notifications, and endless choice, the brain becomes fatigued by decision-making. Familiar media cuts through that overload by offering certainty and reducing cognitive demand. So, as I stare through the wisps of smoke lifting off a fresh brew to the whirling beauty of a beaten-up copy of Here In The Pitch beyond, I feel assured that it is not ruining my life, it is bringing it much-needed routine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Margate-based studio Outsiders has conjured up a new identity for Supernatural – a natural wine brand "not of this earth" – with monster-like wax seals that glow in the dark and tongue-in-cheek storytelling. Margate-based studio Outsiders has conjured up a new identity for Supernatural – a natural wine brand "not of this earth" – with monster-like wax seals that glow in the dark and tongue-in-cheek storytelling. Supernatural wine – dreamt up by Palms Pizzeria founders Stu and Josh – has been brought to life by Margate studio Outsiders, with a brand that's full of folklore, mischief, and myth. It takes the world of natural wine (usually drenched in minimalism and soil references) and flips it upside down, culminating in a small-batch label that's fun, eerie, and beautifully crafted, with bottles that glow after dark. "From the start, they wanted something that stood out and had a sense of irreverence. "We all agreed there was already some fantastic design in this category, so how do you stand out? From its witty tagline ("a natural wine brand not of this earth") to the ghostly wax-sealed tops that double as glow-in-the-dark curiosities, the desire to be different is visible through every touchpoint. "Natural wine is often described through its connection to the soil, sun, and ancient process. Outsiders' approach to Supernatural was grounded in the question of how you make someone pick up your bottle out of the hundreds on a dimly lit shelf. Their answer was to think beyond the label. We were excited to see if that area could become an owned asset." That discovery led to Supernatural's signature feature – its wax seals. When cooled, the wax forms eerie, organic shapes, each one slightly different, like a ghost trapped in motion. "There's a strange, ghostly energy to it," Rogers says. Of course, no supernatural story is complete without a glow-in-the-dark moment. "We're all from the Goosebumps generation," says Lovell. "Nothing says supernatural quite like something glowing in the dark. "We wanted each to embody its own genre," says Rogers. "When you wax-seal a bottle cap, it even gives Frankenstein his hairline, which felt too good not to lean into." The duo's background in fashion and product design also shaped their approach, as evidenced by Supernatural's design as an object of desire. "We were aiming for a sense of collectability, something you'd want two of: one to drink and one to keep," says Lovell. For all the humour and character, there's no shortage of craft. The studio worked with StickerWizard to create glossy relief labels, giving each bottle a tactile, high-end finish. "At no point did we want the wit to come at the cost of communicating that it's a beautiful, low-batch natural wine," says Rogers. "For a long time we thought it wasn't going to work," says Lovell. "I think we can claim that as an Outsiders' invention," Rogers says. "Mixing pigments with wax very specifically to make it glow correctly whilst still reading as white in the light." Supernatural's first three releases – Ghost (white), Vampire (red), and Frankenstein (green Pet Nat) – have already built a cult following, but the brand's world is still expanding. "The concept grows stronger with each release," says Lovell. The studio and founders are now exploring new extensions, from glow-in-the-dark candles that fit into the bottles to ghostly gift wraps. At its core, Supernatural speaks to a new kind of wine drinker – one as interested in design and storytelling as they are in tannins and terroir. "They value quality, authenticity, and originality," says Lovell.

Tucker Carlson — who has peddled several conspiracy theories over the years — dug into his bag of misleading, bonkers claims on Monday to promote the fringe chemtrails conspiracy theory on his show. The episode sees Carlson interviewing Dane Wigington, who once pushed a pseudoscientific theory that California's drought between 2011 and 2017 was the government's doing. Carlson's post was hit with a community note on X that points out there's been no U.S. government admission confirming that chemtrails are “real.” I can tell you: the chemtrail accusations are INSULTING to even basic intelligence.Consider the logistics:- Thousands of modified jets = STCs, manuals, inspections, paper trails- Tens of thousands of pilots, mechanics, ramp crews, dispatchers—no… https://t.co/FA68tDmEoN I testified to Congress about this in September on behalf… Nothing but clear skies in Dallas, Texas for 40 Days during the government shutdown.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moore also revealed on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" that her own children often tell her "they think I'm part alien." All of which she was happy to share with Stephen Colbert, much to his — and our — amusement. During an appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert in support of her role on the series Landman, Moore told the host that she learned recently of his "fascination with aliens," which she thought was perfect because her own children often tell her "they think I'm part alien." When Colbert asked why her daughters — Tallulah, 31, Rumer, 37, and Scout, 34 — think that about her, Moore replied, "I don't know, maybe it's just because I was born in Roswell." Roswell has since leaned into its identity, with annual events such as the UFO Festival, the opening of the International UFO Museum, and other related tourist attractions. When Colbert first brought up the topic to Moore, she said, "Something definitely happened. She added that when Hollywood came calling, with documentaries and the popular WB show, Roswell, now all of a sudden in town, "there was a museum, and now there's a somewhat comprehensive museum discussing how they shut all communication down about it." Well, you know, the largest landing strip in America is in Roswell, so there's a lot of testing that goes on." When she didn't elaborate further, Colbert teased, "Legally, you can't say anything or they'll take you out," to which she joked back, "It's possible." Moore then turned the tables on the late-night host, asking what his fascination with aliens is. "What is not to be fascinated about?" "The possibility there are aliens, or a branch of the military that's been putting out these videos of unexplainable pill-shaped things that go into the water and come out and go from like 0 to 6,000 miles an hour with absolutely no g-force impact — I mean, what? Moore shared with Colbert that she is taking her own alien fascination to the big screen with her upcoming film Strange Arrivals, which is based on the true story of Betty and Barney Hill's alleged alien abduction.
