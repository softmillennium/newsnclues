                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Activists say the death toll in the crackdown on nationwide protests in Iran spiked Sunday to at least 538 people. And with the internet down in Iran and phone lines cut off, gauging the demonstrations from abroad has grown more difficult as AP's Jon Gambrell explains. U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed support for the protesters, hinting at possible military action. Ali Rahmani said the Iranian population was currently “fiercely fighting for its freedom,” a cause his mother Narges Mohammadi had been engaged in “for more than 30 years.” Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian offered a hardening tone in an interview aired on Sunday after nationwide protests challenging Iran's theocracy saw protesters flood the streets in the country's capital and its second-largest city into Sunday morning, crossing the two-week mark of protests.

In this frame grab from footage circulating on social media shows protesters dancing and cheering around a bonfire as they take to the streets despite an intensifying crackdown as the Islamic Republic remains cut off from the rest of the world, in Tehran, Iran, Friday, Jan. 9, 2026. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A crackdown on nationwide protests in Iran has killed at least 538 people and even more are feared dead, activists said Sunday, while Tehran warned that the U.S. military and Israel would be “legitimate targets” if America uses force to protect demonstrators. Another over 10,600 people have been detained over the two weeks of protests, said the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which has been accurate in previous rounds of unrest in Iran in recent years. It relies on supporters in Iran crosschecking information. With the internet down in Iran and phone lines cut off, gauging the demonstrations from abroad has grown more difficult. Those abroad fear the information blackout is emboldening hard-liners within Iran's security services to launch a bloody crackdown. U.S. President Donald Trump has offered support for the protesters, saying on social media that “Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. Trump and his national security team have been weighing a range of potential responses against Iran including cyberattacks and direct strikes by either U.S. or Israel, according to two people familiar with internal White House discussions who were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The White House, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, has not indicated it has made any decisions. He directly threatened Israel, calling it “the occupied territory.” “In the event of an attack on Iran, both the occupied territory and all American military centers, bases and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets,” Qalibaf said. “We do not consider ourselves limited to reacting after the action and will act based on any objective signs of a threat.” Lawmakers rushed the dais in parliament, shouting: “Death to America!” It remains unclear how serious Iran is about launching a strike, particularly after its air defenses were destroyed during the 12-day war in June with Israel. The U.S. military has said in the Mideast it is “postured with forces that span the full range of combat capability to defend our forces, our partners and allies and U.S. interests.” Iran targeted U.S. forces at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in June, while the U.S. Navy's Mideast-based 5th Fleet is stationed in the island kingdom of Bahrain. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio overnight on topics including Iran, the official added. At the Vatican, Pope Leo XIV mentioned Iran as a place “where ongoing tensions continue to claim many lives,” adding that “I hope and pray that dialogue and peace may be patiently nurtured in pursuit of the common good of the whole of society.” A spokesperson said U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was “shocked” by reports of violence against protesters resulting in “scores of deaths” and called on Iranian authorities to use maximum restraint and restore communications. Online videos sent out of Iran, likely using Starlink satellite transmitters, purportedly showed demonstrators gathering in northern Tehran's Punak neighborhood. There, it appeared authorities shut off streets, with protesters waving their lit mobile phones. “Reports were received of surveillance drones flying overhead and movements by security forces around protest locations, indicating ongoing monitoring and security control.” In Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city some 725 kilometers (450 miles) northeast of Tehran, footage purported to show protesters confronting security forces. Protests also appeared to happen in Kerman, 800 kilometers (500 miles) southeast of Tehran. Ali Larijani, a top security official, accused some demonstrators of “killing people or burning some people, which is very similar to what ISIS does,” referring to the Islamic State group by an acronym. State TV aired funerals of slain security force members while reporting another six had been killed in Kermanshah. In Fars province, violence killed 13 people, and seven security forces were killed in North Khorasan province, it added. Even Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, who had been trying to ease anger before the demonstrations exploded in recent days, offered a hardening tone in an interview aired Sunday. “People have concerns, we should sit with them and if it is our duty, we should resolve their concerns,” Pezeshkian said. “But the higher duty is not to allow a group of rioters to come and destroy the entire society.” The protests intensified and grew into calls directly challenging Iran's theocracy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran threatened to strike U.S. and Israeli military bases in the Middle East, considering them “legitimate targets” if President Donald Trump decides to strike the Islamic Republic amid nationwide protests. “In the event of an attack on Iran, both the occupied territory and all American military centers, bases, and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets,” Iranian parliament speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf said on Sunday. “We do not consider ourselves limited to reacting after the action and will act based on any objective signs of a threat.” Last week, the head of Iran's military threatened a preemptive attack over Trump's renewed rhetoric. And Ayatollah Ali Khamenei suggested Trump will be “overthrown” if he intervenes in Iranian affairs. The Iranian parliament speaker's warning comes as Trump had been briefed on options for striking Iran. He hasn't made a final decision on the matter yet. “Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before,” he wrote in a Truth Social post on Saturday. At least 116 people have been killed since anti-government protests broke out late last month, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. It remains to be seen if Iran follows through on its threats against the U.S. and Israel, but that will be entirely dependent on whether Trump authorizes military force. That outcome is now more likely after the recent military operation in Venezuela.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Becky Pepper-Jackson knows that the upcoming sports season could be her last. West Virginia has banned transgender girls like the discus-throwing sophomore from competing in girls and women's sports. Protestors hold signs during a rally at the state capitol in Charleston, W.Va., on March 9, 2023. The Supreme Court stands is Washington, Friday, Jan. 9, 2026. WASHINGTON (AP) — Becky Pepper-Jackson finished third in the discus throw in West Virginia last year though she was in just her first year of high school. West Virginia has banned transgender girls like Pepper-Jackson from competing in girls and women's sports, and is among the more than two dozen states with similar laws. Though the West Virginia law has been blocked by lower courts, the outcome could be different at the conservative-dominated Supreme Court, which has allowed multiple restrictions on transgender people to be enforced in the past year. The second case comes from Idaho, where college student Lindsay Hecox challenged that state's law. President Donald Trump's Republican administration has targeted transgender Americans from the first day of his second term, including ousting transgender people from the military and declaring that gender is immutable and determined at birth. Pepper-Jackson has become the face of the nationwide battle over the participation of transgender girls in athletics that has played out at both the state and federal levels as Republicans have leveraged the issue as a fight for athletic fairness for women and girls. “I think it's something that needs to be done,” Pepper-Jackson said in an interview with The Associated Press that was conducted over Zoom. I know it's important to other people. She sat alongside her mother, Heather Jackson, on a sofa in their home just outside Bridgeport, a rural West Virginia community about 40 miles southwest of Morgantown, to talk about a legal fight that began when she was a middle schooler who finished near the back of the pack in cross-country races. Pepper-Jackson has grown into a competitive discus and shot put thrower. She attributes her success to hard work, practicing at school and in her backyard, and lifting weights. Pepper-Jackson has been taking puberty-blocking medication and has publicly identified as a girl since she was in the third grade, though the Supreme Court's decision in June upholding state bans on gender-affirming medical treatment for minors has forced her to go out of state for care. Her very improvement as an athlete has been cited as a reason she should not be allowed to compete against girls. And if we allow biological males to play sports against biological females, those differences will erode the ability and the places for women in these sports which we have fought so hard for over the last 50 years,” West Virginia's attorney general, JB McCuskey, said in an AP interview. McCuskey said he is not aware of any other transgender athlete in the state who has competed or is trying to compete in girls or women's sports. The NCAA and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committees banned transgender women from women's sports after Trump signed an executive order aimed at barring their participation. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in October 2025 found that about 6 in 10 U.S. adults “strongly” or “somewhat” favored requiring transgender children and teenagers to only compete on sports teams that match the sex they were assigned at birth, not the gender they identify with, while about 2 in 10 were “strongly” or “somewhat” opposed and about one-quarter did not have an opinion. About 2.1 million adults, or 0.8%, and 724,000 people age 13 to 17, or 3.3%, identify as transgender in the U.S., according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. Those allied with the administration on the issue paint it in broader terms than just sports, pointing to state laws, Trump administration policies and court rulings against transgender people. “I think there are cultural, political, legal headwinds all supporting this notion that it's just a lie that a man can be a woman,” said John Bursch, a lawyer with the conservative Christian law firm Alliance Defending Freedom that has led the legal campaign against transgender people. “And if we want a society that respects women and girls, then we need to come to terms with that truth. And the sooner that we do that, the better it will be for women everywhere, whether that be in high school sports teams, high school locker rooms and showers, abused women's shelters, women's prisons.” But Heather Jackson offered different terms to describe the effort to keep her daughter off West Virginia's playing fields. Pepper-Jackson has seen some of the uglier side of the debate on display, including when a competitor wore a T-shirt at the championship meet that said, “Men Don't Belong in Women's Sports.” “I wish these people would educate themselves. One schoolmate, identified as A.C. in court papers, said Pepper-Jackson has herself used graphic language in sexually bullying her teammates. The court ruled in 2020 that workplace discrimination against transgender people is sex discrimination, but refused to extend the logic of that decision to the case over health care for transgender minors. The court has been deluged by dueling legal briefs from Republican- and Democratic-led states, members of Congress, athletes, doctors, scientists and scholars. If Pepper-Jackson is forced to stop competing, she said she will still be able to lift weights and continue playing trumpet in the school concert and jazz bands. “It will hurt a lot, and I know it will, but that's what I'll have to do,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“It's just throwing something that's heavy,” the 15-year-old West Virginian said. That description could also apply to her blockbuster legal case. While Pepper-Jackson sounds like any teen navigating school assignments, friends and a demanding practice schedule, the transgender girl has also been carrying the weight of a national cultural and political battle that will reach a crescendo Tuesday when the Supreme Court debates two appeals dealing with state bans on trans girls playing on women's teams. And Pepper-Jackson understands that — in the hands of a 6-3 conservative court that has been increasingly skeptical of transgender rights — her effort is a long shot. “Someone has to do this because this is just a terrible thing,” Pepper-Jackson told CNN in an interview with her family and attorneys. In June, the court let stand state laws that bar transgender care for minors. The appeals have arrived at a moment of enormous political backlash against transgender people. Roughly two-thirds of Americans believe that athletes should play on teams that match their sex at birth and more than half of US states have enacted laws similar to the one in West Virginia. Cisgender women, they say, would be forced to compete against “bigger, faster, and stronger” athletes who were born as males and would ultimately lose. “To say that allowing only biological females to compete in girls' sports violates Title IX fails the commonsense test,” West Virginia Attorney General JB McCuskey, a Republican, told CNN. Critics say that assumes an influx of transgender students trying out for girls' sports teams. Court documents suggest that, in fact, West Virginia has identified only Pepper-Jackson. “It may be that we have one defendant,” he said, “but there's a nationwide issue here.” Given those treatments, her attorneys stress, she has “never experienced the effects of testosterone on her body” and doesn't have the inherent biological advantages states like West Virginia are attempting to regulate with their laws. Nor does Pepper-Jackson come across as a teen driven to win her weekend track meets at any cost. She said she likes to play sports because of her friends and the “life skills that you won't learn anywhere else.” She is proud of her personal record in discus, 120 feet. For Pepper-Jackson, feelings of accomplishment are often followed by self-doubt. Heather Jackson, Becky's mother, recalled watching her daughter's face shift from pride to fear when she toppled a previous personal best a few years ago. “She knew that's what they were going to focus on,” Jackson said of her daughter's critics. “No kid should feel guilty for doing their best.” Lilyana Williams, a former team captain of her high school track team in Pennsylvania, helped to organize a policy at her school prohibiting transgender students from competing on teams that match their gender identity. Williams, who recently graduated from nursing school, said she worked with the religious Pennsylvania Family Institute to implement that policy after a transgender student briefly competed on her team. She said that arrangement didn't just hurt the team's top athletes but also many others who were “just wanting to finish in a specific spot.” “None of it was coming from a perspective of hate,” Williams told CNN, “but rather the idea that women deserve equality, both on the field and off the field, and we deserve a right to fairness.” Transgender sports bans have spread like wildfire across the US in just a few years. The Supreme Court will hear arguments Tuesday in two of those cases – one from Pepper-Jackson challenging West Virginia's law. The other comes from a student at Boise State University, Lindsay Hecox, who is challenging Idaho's law. The Idaho law, enacted in March 2020, was blocked later that year when a judge appointed by President Donald Trump ruled it was likely unconstitutional. In Pepper-Jackson's case, a federal district court sided with West Virginia. But the Richmond-based 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2024 that the state's ban violated Pepper-Jackson's rights under Title IX, a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex at schools that receive federal aid. The Supreme Court in 2023 allowed Pepper-Jackson, then a middle-school student, to temporarily continue competing in cross-country and track while her litigation played out. Two conservative justices – Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito – dissented from that decision. Takeaways from the Supreme Court's historic decision on transgender care “People believe this stuff that ADF tells them because they don't know a trans kid who's playing sports, and so they don't have a frame of reference for how completely egregiously untrue these claims are,” said Cathryn Oakley, the senior director of legal policy for the Human Rights Campaign. Matt Sharp, a senior counsel at ADF, insisted that “it very much was an issue” before the avalanche of laws banning trans athletes from competing on teams that align with their gender identity. “These lawmakers were saying, ‘We want to prevent this from ever happening in our state,'” Sharp said. “And that's what led to 27 states ultimately looking at this and coming up with a solution to preserve the fairness that Title IX had originally given young women.” Title IX bars schools that receive federal funding from treating students differently based on their sex. Pepper-Jackson and her attorneys say that is exactly what categorical bans on transgender student athletes do. “When Becky is prevented from being on teams with other girls just like her, she is subjected to discrimination that effectively excludes her from participating in the school's educational programs,” said Joshua Block, a senior counsel with the ACLU who will argue the case before the Supreme Court on Tuesday. And that is likely to be a central debate in the arguments Tuesday. Pepper-Jackson and her family are aware of those challenges.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In four short videos on an electronic device found with his body, the suspect in last month's fatal shootings at Brown University and of an MIT professor laid out a patchwork of details about the attacks. Woven among his confessions to the crimes and winding related thoughts, several nuggets match facts that emerged as authorities were identifying Claudio Neves Valente, 48, as wanted in the killings of students Ella Cook and MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, and Professor Nuno F.G. Loureiro. As the videos' transcripts – translated from Portuguese and released this week by the US Attorney's Office in Massachusetts – raise fresh questions, they also intersect with key known elements of the case. Here's how some of the suspect's own words flesh out – or further blur – the crimes that rocked Greater Boston and a manhunt that captured national attention. Okay, (sighs) as you can see, my eye is kind of f**ked up. It's a shell round, bounced there. I don't know if there are any kind of implications on the success of what I wanted to do or not … As he'll more clearly explain, Neves Valente was hurt during one of the shootings. His eye injury was not shared publicly, if known at all, by law enforcement between the Brown attack on December 13 and the discovery five days later of the suspect dead by suicide at a storage facility. Uh … I had already planned this for a little more. It seems that I'm starting to see a bit better out of my eye, but very little or almost nothing. The only objective was to (pause) leave more or less on my own terms, and – and it's – it's already long overdue. The suspect seems to reveal how long he planned at least one of the attacks. But even as he speaks of “final conclusions” and his “only objective,” he offers no motive for the shootings at this or at any point in the videos; it's a critical element of the case still under scrutiny by federal investigators. And at least leave (pause) that I wasn't – wouldn't be the one who ended up suffering the most from all of this. So, if you don't like it, tough luck. There was also a lot of sh*t that I did not like, and I had to put up with it. So, what has been done now … I'm in a storage space in Salem, (New Hampshire), I've had this here for three years, I think. Neves Valente doesn't go into what exactly he “had to put up with” before pivoting to his location: the storage space he says he rented far longer than the few weeks investigators had thought. Brown University shooting suspect planned attack for a long time, offering no motive in video confession, officials say After killing his former academic colleague Loureiro on December 15 in Brookline, Massachusetts – about 50 miles away from the Brown attack in Providence, Rhode Island – the suspect immediately drove about 40 miles and swiped into the storage unit in Salem, New Hampshire, according to Rhode Island's attorney general. It appears he never swiped out. I would have money for a few more good years, if it was in Portugal or a cheaper place it would still be a long time, but I don't care. I've been here … I've been here without caring for a very long time now. From Entroncamento in central Portugal, Neves Valente was a “very bright” but reclusive young man who was estranged from his family and whose mother once told a neighbor her son “needs help, but he doesn't want to get it,” said his former neighbors in Lisbon, where he and Loureiro both were students between 1995 and 2000 at a prestigious engineering school. Neves Valente began studying at Brown in 2000 on an F-1 visa – a nonimmigrant visa for full-time international students – US Attorney Leah Foley of Massachusetts has said. He likely took physics classes in the Barus & Holley building where the December shooting unfolded. Honestly, my only regret is this thing in the eye (laughs). But it was really hard, man. But since I was almost confronted by a guy there that day … not almost, I actually was confronted and he knew my … my … my license plate … . Right before the gunfire at Brown, the suspect stopped in a bathroom at the Barus & Holley building, where a man – later identified as John, per a police affidavit – noticed his clothes seemed inadequate for the cold weather. John earlier had seen nearby a “grey Nissan with Florida plates, possibly a rental,” the document states, and he soon saw the suspect leave the building and appear to unlock the Nissan with a key fob. John stayed outside as the man suddenly turned from the vehicle and walked in a different direction, then circled back before changing directions whenever he saw John, the witness told investigators. The man responded: “Why are you harassing me?” it say﻿s. … I honestly never thought it would take them so long to find me. I am not going to apologize, because during my lifetime no one sincerely apologized to me. Uhm, the few times there was an appearance that it had happened, I later had access, uhm, to the people privately, the conversations we had privately showed it was all fake. Uhm (pause) so they are not going to get anything from me. I did not like any one of you. I saw all of this sh*t from the beginning. I began to grow suspicious since I barely had conscious memories, at the age of three. At the age of five, I was already sure … So go f**k yourselves, to hell with you. “(O)n the contrary, he exposed his true nature when he blamed innocent, unarmed children for their deaths at his hand.” The suspect did not give any further details about prior apologies he'd gotten or his suspicions as a young child. Three e-mails should go out today, tonight, people will receive them, basically. The US Attorney's Office in Massachusetts has stated it would provide further updates as new information becomes available and victims are properly notified. And the thing is with this eye situation, I even thought about doing it with glasses on, and then at the last moment I thought: no, because the glasses fog up, this is at close range, (unintelligible). If I had done it, it wouldn't have … But I also have no interest whatsoever in staying here. I also have no interest in being famous. I don't give a damn about how you judge me or what you think of me. The overwhelming majority of things that are going to be said, I can already imagine. Many mass shooters have shown ﻿a fascination with or been fixated on other mass shooters and their lives out of a need to feel understood, to have role models and to be part of a community, according to experts in the psychology of school shooters. Neves Valente seems to nod to the culture that fawns over mass attackers while insisting he wants no part of it. In fact, I was already reading, uhm, I particularly like Trump's sh*t, to have – have called me an animal, which is true. I would really like to thank you for the only opportunity that you gave me here, which was this one ﻿… . “Hopefully, they're going to capture this animal,” President Donald Trump told reporters December 15 from the Oval Office, adding it's “always difficult” to manage an investigation of this kind. Neighbors in Lisbon recall Brown University attack suspect as quiet, reclusive student Even though the stupid car is outside, and obviously there is a record of my entry, and there are cameras and sh*t, but it will probably be a few good hours, so, the longer I stay here, the better. Before arriving late December 15 to the storage facility, the suspect's rental car was seen several times around Brown between December 1, when he got it in Boston, and December 12, including by John. Between the university shooting and the professor's killing, Neves Valente swapped its license plates to an unregistered Maine plate. Still, the suspect parked his car outdoors at the storage facility, where he knew there'd be proof he swiped in. Meanwhile, authorities plugged a description of the Nissan into a system run by Flock Safety that can read license plates and identify other vehicle details, then match sightings of ﻿the same car, including with different tags. Neves Valente also appears to portend his own manner of death. If you or someone you know needs help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 or 800-273-8255. Actually, I think that coming here, both times I did, was a f**king mistake. But to say that you all are extraordinarily bad, that would be … nei – nei – neither bad nor good. It's the same thing with Portugal, and most of the places where I have been. Wherever a guy goes (pause) that's how it is. Let's see how this is going to wor – work now. If I really have the courage to do this. His first stint at Brown was brief, “attending for only three semesters as a graduate student until taking a leave in 2001 and formally withdrawing effective July 31, 2003,” the school's president wrote after his death. The suspect reentered the US in 2017 via the diversity visa program, where a specified number of applicants from designated countries are admitted through a lottery system, according to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. He got permanent legal US residency, known as a green card, and, at some point later, a Florida driver's license. Meanwhile, Neves Valente had not spoken with his parents in years, a former neighbor told CNN. At one point, his mother confided to the neighbor her fear he would sell his Lisbon apartment and disappear, which the neighbor says eventually happened. In these two instances, I needed a catalyst – for both of them. But for the first one, it was the fact that I was confronted, and in the second, I also had one, you could say, a little bit. It is not clear whether or how Neves Valente and Loureiro may have interacted during their time in the same Portuguese physics program and if they were in touch afterward. Loureiro graduated in 2000 with his physics degree and stayed on as a researcher before becoming a professor in 2016 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Loureiro, 47, was found wounded in the foyer of his condo building in Brookline, Massachusetts, a neighbor told the Boston Globe, and later died at a hospital. “There was security footage that captured (Neves Valente) within a half mile of the professor's residence in Brookline, and there is video footage of him entering an apartment building in the location of the professor's apartment,” said Foley, the US attorney for the District of Massachusetts. Loureiro is believed to have been targeted, a law enforcement official said. Suspects in some high-profile attacks have been described as having mental health problems, but that doesn't mean their mental health issues are to blame for the killings, experts have said. Indeed, people with mental illness are much more likely to be victims, rather than perpetrators, of violence, studies show. Mental illness is a strong causal factor in suicides, studies show. I want to know if you are going to post this, maybe I would prefer that you don't, and (pause) I don't care at all about being famous, having a legacy, and sh*t like that, manifestos and f**king stuff. I have absolutely no patience for that. Even though I would have a lot to say and write, I don't care. Federal officials released the transcripts Tuesday. The feds are investigating Brown University's safety after this month's shooting. It seems like someone over there said that I was saying that I was … Allah Akbar (phonetic) or some sh*t like that. I do not remember having said anything. If I did say something, it must have been some kind of an – an exclamation, uhm, because I thought that one … “Allahu Akbar,” meaning “God is greater,” is used by Muslims in moments of celebration and gratitude. The phrase also sometimes is used as a battle cry and has been employed by those with a nefarious agenda to instill fear of anyone who utters it and to raise concerns about Islam itself, according to Muslim scholars and civil rights advocates. I wanted to do it in a regular room. And I thought, fuc – it was, and I must have made an exclamation like, “Oh no!” or something like that, to express that it was empty, that is, if I said something like that. It was about 4 p.m. when a 21-year-old teaching assistant was wrapping a review session with a reported 60 or so students in the Barus & Holley building's room 166, one of its largest classrooms. Joseph Oduro heard shots in the hall before the gunman entered his room through a door at the back, locked eyes with the economics teaching assistant, yelled something incomprehensible, then “just started shooting,” Oduro said. I thought that the people had left. They ah … all of those people that were hiding, under the … the table, or whatever the hell, they could have perfectly left through there. Oduro and about 20 students ducked and huddled behind a 10-foot-long desk at the front of the auditorium, and he called 911, then waited what “felt like an eternity” for the gunfire to stop, he said. He didn't lift his head until campus public safety officers arrived and told them it was safe to leave. One who hid with the TA was shot in her legs, Oduro said. CNN's Hannah Rabinowitz, Andy Rose, Eric Levenson, Duarte Mendonca and Jen Christensen contributed to this story.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In certain ethnic groups, widows are pressured to marry their late husband's brother or have sex with another man to “cleanse” them of the stigma of widowhood. Kenya's constitution guarantees all citizens the right to own land. But the local assembly in one Kenyan county has unanimously passed a Widows Protection Bill that would criminalize the forced disinheritance. Anne Bonareri, a widow, looks out the window of her home in Kisii, Kenya, Wednesday, Nov. 26, 2025. Widow Marie Owino, 87 years old, a former teacher sits inside her home in Siaya, Kenya, Thursday, Nov. 27, 2025. Widows Rebecca Anyango, 70 years old, right, and Marie Owino, 87 years old, a former teacher, left, walk outside Marie's compound home in Siaya, Kenya, Thursday, Nov. 27, 2025. Widow Marie Owino, 87 years old, a former teacher, holds a portrait of her late husband at her home in Siaya, Kenya, Thursday, Nov. 27, 2025. SIAYA, Kenya (AP) — Rebecca Anyango stood outside the house she has called home for 26 years, wondering how long it will remain hers. As a widow, she's been threatened with eviction for years by her late husband's family, who claim she has no inheritance rights. This year they filed a lawsuit, and the 70-year-old Anyango has no legal representation. She pointed out where her husband is buried, a few steps from the door. “Where do I take the grave?” she asked softly. Anyango is among thousands of widows in western Kenya who face losing everything after their husbands die. They are often in rural areas and with little education, unaware of their rights. In the Luo, Luhya, and Kisii ethnic groups, widowhood can come with certain cultural expectations that can be considered illegal. One is “sexual cleansing,” in which a widow is made to have sex with another man, often a brother of her late husband, in the belief that the “dark cloud” of widowhood will lift. Another is “wife inheritance,” in which a widow is taken in as a wife by her late husband's brother. Those who refuse, like Anyango and others who spoke with The Associated Press, are often isolated and stripped of their land, a violation of Kenya's constitutional guarantee of the right to land ownership for all citizens. “If the woman is not aware of what protects her, then she will be disinherited,” said Simiyu Waddimba, who teaches anthropology at the University of Nairobi and authored a paper on wife inheritance. The legislation was championed by county legislator Scholastica Madowo, herself a widow and one of four elected women in the 42-member local assembly. “Those cultural practices are actually a violation of their rights unless the woman does it willingly,” she said. Bonareri was left with three young children and another on the way. When she refused, armed men were sent to attack her. Her daughter, Emma Mong'ute, founded the Amandla MEK Foundation in 2019 to help women in such circumstances by offering legal advice and connecting them to pro bono lawyers. She said they have had some success in helping women retain land. She said her organization would consider pushing for a bill like the one in Siaya County. Some widows elsewhere in Africa face similar pressures. In southern Africa, there is tension between general and customary law, which dominates inheritance cases. “While the general law protects the inheritance rights of surviving spouses and children, customary practices still allow different ethnic groups to administer estates according to their traditions, often to the detriment of widows,” said Misheck Dube, a former associate professor at the University of Limpopo in South Africa who has researched widowhood. Most widows are disinherited because they don't understand Kenya's land succession laws, which recognize widows and children as the true inheritors, said Easter Okech with the Kenya Female Advisory Organization in Kisumu County. She now offers legal training for women so they can represent themselves, and some are doing so in ongoing cases. She also encourages people to write wills — many people in rural areas don't make one — and have a neutral executor. Some widows in western Kenya have fought back on their own. Marie Owino, a 87-year-old former teacher, said she knew her rights under the law. Associated Press journalist Farai Mutsaka contributed from Harare, Zimbabwe.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As a child, Marco Rubio sat at his grandfather's feet cigar-smoke curling on the front porch as stories spilled out — tales of Cuban heroes like José Martí and the guerilla soldiers who fought Spanish rule, and of life under the communist regime his family left behind. Even then, Rubio imagined himself as part of Cuba's unfinished struggle. “I boasted I would someday lead an army of exiles to overthrow Fidel Castro and become president of a free Cuba,” Rubio recalled in his 2012 memoir, “An American Son.” A half-century later, that childhood bravado appears strikingly prophetic. Rubio, now President Donald Trump's secretary of state and national security adviser, played a central role in shaping the US military's stunning capture of a different Latin American leader, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a longtime close ally of Cuba. Now, as Rubio emerges as the public face of a brazen new era of American foreign policy — one that has rattled allies, undercut Congress' war powers and thrust the Western Hemisphere into uncertainty — longtime friends and allies say they see the product of those formative forces. “Marco has brought to the White House not just the knowledge and the history but how people feel when they have to flee everything they have,” Tomas Regalado, a trailblazing Cuban American broadcaster and former Miami mayor, told CNN. “He is what every Cuban mother wants their sons to be – loving Miami, thanking the United States but never forgetting Cuba.” Miami's Cuban immigrants have long commanded outsized influence in American politics, a byproduct of their prominence in Florida, a coveted battleground state until recently. In shops and restaurants throughout Little Havana, pictures memorialize decades of ambitious politicians sipping cafecito and donning guayaberas during pilgrimages to the vibrant Cuban neighborhood. “People want to know first that you're one of them, and then they want to hear what you're doing about everything else,” he said. That's why this is so baked into Rubio's DNA.” “When you think of Cuban American Gen Xers, our entire lives have been eclipsed by the struggle for freedom, justice and democracy in countries like Cuba and Venezuela,” Curbelo went on. “We grew up in direct contact with the people who suffered through these tragic events. His grandfather detested President John F. Kennedy for the Bay of Pigs debacle and revered President Ronald Reagan for his hardline anti-communism. Those sentiments, widely shared among Cuban exiles, have given Republicans an edge in Florida, and they became “defining influences on me politically,” Rubio said. He interned in the offices of Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Díaz-Balart, Cuban stalwarts on Capitol Hill. In 1996, at age 25, he served as the South Florida coordinator for Bob Dole's presidential campaign. Two years later, fresh out of law school and newly married, Rubio challenged an incumbent for a seat on the West Miami commission. Armed with fluent Spanish and boyish good looks, Rubio canvassed neighborhoods where conversations about local concerns reliably turned toward Cuba's past and future. “I was an heir to two generations of unfulfilled dreams,” Rubio wrote. Rubio has often described himself as the Miami-born “son of exiles,” a distinction that implies his parents arrived in the US after Fidel Castro seized power in 1959. He has suggested as much repeatedly, including in his official US Senate biography. Rubio acknowledged the errors, attributing them to his family's “oral history,” but he maintained that his parents identified as exiles because they would have returned to Cuba were it not for Castro's rule. “They tried to live in Cuba again, and the reality of what it was made that impossible.” Rubio won his race for West Miami commissioner in November 1998. One month later, Venezuela elected a new president: the left-wing populist Hugo Chávez. Chávez's rise alarmed Cuban exiles in Miami, many of whom insist to this day they warned Venezuelans that the political forces that overtook Cuba could take hold there as well. “There has never been any separation in solidarity in the call for freedom for Cuba and the call for freedom in Venezuela and Nicaragua as well,” said Ana Carbonell, a veteran GOP adviser on Hispanic engagement. Garcia, who served as Rubio's first legislative aide, said these new arrivals did not initially dominate conversations in Tallahassee. Coverage of Rubio's time there rarely mentions the country, nor is Venezuela addressed in his first book. “He was always inquisitive about the history of Latin America and would ask often about my father who was a Bay of Pigs veteran,” said Bovo, whose wife Viviana is a longtime Rubio aide. “But there wasn't always a forum for it until he got to the Senate. Floridians elected Rubio to the Senate in 2010, and he grew increasingly outspoken on Venezuela. In 2014, he cosponsored sanction legislation and delivered a blistering Senate-floor critique of Chávez's successor, Nicolás Maduro, amid violent crackdowns on protesters. But after falling short — capped by a stinging second-place finish in Florida, where he failed to consolidate the Cuban vote — Rubio returned to the Senate with renewed focus on South America. He often stood out as a singular voice urging the US to confront socialist regimes in its backyard. At times, he posted hourly updates about Venezuela's humanitarian crisis on social media. His advocacy made him a recognizable figure across Latin America and Trump's point person on the Western Hemisphere. “Losing is very healthy for most people,” Curbelo said. A campaign by Rubio to oust Maduro, though, stalled during Trump's first term. Although the administration — at Rubio's urging — joined allies in recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaidó as Venezuela's rightful president, the international push fizzled and Maduro maintained power. Meanwhile, Venezuela's collapse accelerated migration out of the country. While in office, President Joe Biden granted the vast majority of Venezuelan refugees temporary protected status allowing them to remain in the US, a move Rubio vocally backed. Trump ended those protections last year and his administration made clear this week they still face deportation following Maduro's ouster. “Secretary Noem ended Temporary Protected Status for more than 500,000 Venezuelans,” the department said in a post on X, “and now they can go home to a country that they love.” The Department of State did not respond to CNN's request for comment for this story, including the question of whether Rubio believed it was safe for Venezuelans living in the US to return to their country. “I struggle with impatience to this day,” Rubio wrote in his book, “and when I exhibit the weakness at a restaurant or in some other public place, my wife will remind me that I am behaving like that six-year-old at IHOP.” Yet, on Venezuela, Rubio has played a long game. Rubio endorsed Trump during the GOP primary for president in 2024 and maintained close ties with his inner circle, including campaign manager and fellow Floridian Susie Wiles. Rubio found new allies in his push for regime change in Venezuela, including senior White House adviser Stephen Miller, CNN recently reported. In South Florida, many Cubans have grown emboldened by Maduro's removal and Rubio's influence on the sudden sea change in American foreign policy. Trump has not discouraged the speculation, telling reporters Cuba may soon “fall on its own.” Rubio has been less circumspect about the fate of his ancestral home.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There, on the bedside table, investigators found a framed photo of Brendan smiling with another woman – the family's au pair, according to court records. Brendan Banfield now faces a double-murder trial, with jury selection scheduled Monday, as prosecutors allege he plotted with the au pair to kill his wife and another man. Banfield – a former IRS agent, according to CNN affiliate WUSA – has pleaded not guilty to aggravated murder and a firearm offense in the fatal stabbing of his wife and the fatal shooting of Joseph Ryan. Prosecutors say Brendan Banfield and the family's Brazilian au pair, Juliana Peres Magalhães, were having an extra-marital affair and carried out the plan together. The salacious plot features allegations of BDSM sexual role play, trips to the gun range and false 911 calls, all in an attempt to kill Banfield's wife and frame Ryan, according to prosecutors. Peres Magalhães was initially charged with murder and has since pleaded guilty to a lesser count of involuntary manslaughter for fatally shooting Ryan. She is likely to be the star witness in Banfield's murder trial. The trial is expected to last about four weeks. Banfield has been held without bond since his arrest, according to police. He faces up to life in prison on the murder charges. In one call, Banfield told dispatchers he'd shot a man who stabbed his wife, according to police. There was no forced entry at the home. When police searched the home, they found a framed photo of Banfield and Peres Magalhães smiling together on his bedside table. A year later, in October 2024, court records show Peres Magalhães pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter. As they alleged, Peres Magalhães began working as an au pair for the couple in late 2021, and in August 2022 she and Brendan Banfield began an extra-marital relationship. “In the fall of 2022, Brendan Banfield expressed to Peres Magalhães his desire to be rid of his wife and soon thereafter began planning to kill his wife as well as, ultimately, Joseph Ryan, the victim in this case,” prosecutors said. Banfield set up an account on Fetlife.com, a sexual fetish site, began communicating with Ryan and lured him to the Banfield home, prosecutors said. Ryan “likely believed” he was meeting Christine Banfield for a consensual sexual encounter involving “violent sexual role play” with a knife, prosecutors said. She expressed hesitation with the plan at various points, prosecutors said, but “he insisted it was too late for her to back out.” Banfield taught the au pair how to fire a gun at a local gun range in the fall and winter of 2022, prosecutors said. As part of their plan, when Ryan came to the home, Peres Magalhães called Banfield to report that a strange man was at the house, and Banfield was waiting at a nearby McDonald's so he could return to the home quickly, prosecutors said. He and Peres Magalhães put his child in the basement and then went upstairs to the Banfields' bedroom, with Brendan Banfield holding his service weapon and the au pair holding a firearm he had purchased a month earlier, according to prosecutors. “Brendan Banfield called out, ‘Police officer,' and then shot Joseph Ryan in the head, and Ryan fell away from Christine Banfield.” Peres Magalhães called 911 but ended the call at Banfield's direction, prosecutors said. Peres Magalhães saw Ryan still moving and shot him, prosecutors said. The au pair then called 911 again and they reported the killings as if Ryan was an intruder who had stabbed Banfield's wife, according to prosecutors. Banfield was indicted on murder charges in September 2024. “And certainly it has taken a road, 570 days later, where we are finally in a position to announce that two persons are being charged and held responsible and introduced to our criminal justice system for these two murders.” “Today's agreement marks a significant step forward in this case, and it is an important development in our pursuit of justice for the victims and their families,” Fairfax County Commonwealth's Attorney Steve Descano said of the au pair's guilty plea. In addition, Banfield was indicted on a count of felony child abuse and neglect and felony child cruelty related to the killings in December 2024.</p>

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the possibility of U.S. intervention in Iran, according to a report. The two leaders spoke by phone Saturday as Israel is on "high alert," preparing for the possibility of U.S. military intervention in Iran, according to Reuters, citing multiple Israeli sources. On Saturday, the Iranian regime triggered an internet "kill switch" in an apparent effort to conceal alleged abuses by security forces and as protests against it surged nationwide, according to a cybersecurity expert. The blackout reduced internet access to a fraction of normal levels. Secretary of State Marco Rubio holds his end-of-year press conference at the State Department in Washington, D.C., Dec. 19, 2025. On Sunday, Iran's parliament speaker warned that the U.S. military and Israel would be "legitimate targets" if America strikes the Islamic Republic. President Donald Trump offered support for the protesters on Saturday, writing on Truth Social that "Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. In this frame grab from video obtained by the AP outside Iran, a masked demonstrator holds a picture of Iran's Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi during a protest in Tehran, Iran, Friday, Jan. 9, 2026. At a news conference Friday, Trump said Iran was facing mounting pressure as unrest spreads across the country. "It looks to me that the people are taking over certain cities that nobody thought were really possible just a few weeks ago. "We'll be hitting them very hard where it hurts. And that doesn't mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts," he said. Protests in Iran intensify for the 12th day.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Maxim Naumov holds a photo of his parents after competing during the men's free skate competition at the U.S. Emilea Zingas and Vadym Kolesnik react to their scores after the free dance competition at the U.S. ST. LOUIS (AP) — World champions and Olympic favorites Ilia Malinin and the ice dance team of Madison Chock and Evan Bates turned the final night of the U.S. Figure Skating Championships on Saturday into less of a competition and more of a coronation. Malinin easily won his fourth straight title despite a dialed-back free skate that included just three quads — still more than anyone in the field, but far fewer than the seven it could include. And the duo of Chock and Bates won their record seventh championship with a flamenco-style free dance set to a version of “Paint It Black” from the dystopian sci-fi Western show “Westworld.” They will be the anchors for a powerful American team headed to the Milan Cortina Games in less than a month. “I decided not to go for any risks. I wanted to play it safe, because hopefully in a few weeks I have to go again,” Malinin said. Malinin finished with 324.88 points to continue an unbeaten streak stretching more than two years. Andrew Torgashev was a distant second with 267.62 points, while Maxim Naumov finished third by less than a tenth of a point over Jacob Sanchez. In doing so, Naumov may have fulfilled a dream he held along with his late parents. Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova were among those killed when an American Airlines flight collided with a helicopter and crashed into the icy Potomac River in January 2025. “I gritted my teeth on everything. Chock and Bates, the three-time reigning world champions, wound up with 228.87 points following the free dance. Emilea Zingas and Vadym Kolesnik were second with 213.65 while Christina Carreira and Anthony Ponomarenko were third with 206.95. Those three are expected to fill out the American dance team for the Olympics when official selections are announced Sunday. “The feeling that we got from the audience today was unlike anything I've ever felt before,” said Chock, who along with Bates helped the Americans win team gold at the Beijing Olympics four years ago, but finished a disappointing fourth in the ice dance. It's a great feeling going into a big event knowing you skated well the previous event.” Chock and Bates will be heavy favorites to win gold next month in Italy. Just like their 21-year-old teammate from Fairfax, Virginia. Malinin was somewhat controversially left off the American team for Beijing, when U.S. Figure Skating officials chose the more experienced Jason Brown over him. Rather than sulk, the self-styled “Quad God” with the unique, avant-garde style turned the four years since then into an unstoppable march through just about every competition he has entered. Malinin added a quad lutz and a quad salchow-triple axel combination later in the program, almost as if to remind folks that even when he's playing it safe, he can still land the big jumps whenever he wants. Skating to “In This Shirt” by The Irrepressibles, Naumov landed an opening quad salchow but tripled his other planned quad. It was an emotional week for Naumov, who brought to the kiss-and-cry area an old photo of him with his parents. The 24-year-old Torgashev, who is half Ukrainian and still has family in the war-torn country, landed both of his quads during a clean free skate, one of them in combination with a double axel. It was an emphatic statement by Torgashev for his inclusion on the Olympic team.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Actor TK Carter arrives for the premiere of “The LA Riot” at the Tribeca Film Festival, Monday, April 25, 2005, in New York. Carter, who appeared in the horror film “The Thing” and “Punky Brewster” on television, has died at the age of 69. Carter was declared dead Friday evening after deputies responded to a call regarding an unresponsive male in Duarte, California, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Police did not disclose a cause of death or other details, but said no foul play was suspected. Thomas Kent “T.K.” Carter was born Dec. 18, 1956, in New York City and was raised in Southern California. He began his career in stand-up comedy and with acting roles. Carter had been acting for years before a breakthrough role as Nauls the cook in John Carpenter's 1982 horror classic, “The Thing.” He also had a recurring role in the 1980s sitcom “Punky Brewster.” Carter was a consummate professional and a genuine soul whose talent transcended genres,” his publicist, Tony Freeman, said in a statement. “He brought laughter, truth, and humanity to every role he touched. His legacy will continue to inspire generations of artists and fans alike.”</p>
