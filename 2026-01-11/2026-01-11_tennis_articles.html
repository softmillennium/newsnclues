                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After two straight final losses, Poland captured its first United Cup title Sunday in Sydney, overcoming Iga Swiatek's loss to Belinda Bencic as Katarzyna Kawa and Jan Zielinski sealed the comeback in mixed doubles. SYDNEY, Australia -- Poland finally broke through at the United Cup on Sunday evening, capturing its first championship after falling in the 2024 and 2025 finals with a 2-1 victory over Switzerland at Ken Rosewall Arena. Kawa and Zielinski finished a perfect 5-0 in mixed doubles during the tournament, closing the championship tie with a 6-4, 6-3 win over the previously unbeaten pairing of Bencic and Jakub Paul. In the opening set, Kawa delivered a pivotal volley at the net on set point at 5-4 during a deciding point that shifted the match in Poland's favor. "I think it always pays off when you're brave on the important points, especially in doubles," Kawa said to reporters. Yeah, I'm really happy that we sealed this set and we were able to get this match won." She finished with a 9-1 overall record and earned the event's most valuable player award. Bencic went 5-0 in singles, highlighted by Top 10 victories over No. 8 Jasmine Paolini, and collected 500 ranking points for her performance. Bencic won 12 of the final 15 games against Swiatek, earning her second career victory over the World No. 2 on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz. “It's always a challenge playing against her and every time I play her, I look for ways to improve and make her life a bit more difficult,” said Bencic, who defeated Swiatek for the first time in over four years. A post shared by United Cup (@unitedcuptennis) Swiatek started strong early, holding serve in the opening game with four straight points followed by the match's first break and another hold. With Swiatek up 3-0, Bencic did settle into the match, winning two consecutive games of her own, cutting the deficit to 3-2 after a backhand winner on the third break point. Bencic started the second set winning nine consecutive points, and in the third game, she saved two break points. A post shared by United Cup (@unitedcuptennis) “To be honest, I felt I was in the match from the very first point,” Bencic said. With a powerful forehand to set up break point, she took advantage of the crucial point, returning Swiatek's serve with a convincing backhand winner. Following a service hold, Bencic put herself within two games of the win, leading 4-1, and capitalized. Swiatek fought to the last point, holding two games of serve and saving two match points with a pair of aces, but Bencic's backhand winner on the third match point sealed the win. Although Wawrinka earned a crucial break on his way to winning the second set, the three-time Grand Slam champion converted just two of 23 break-point chances across his five singles matches at the event. Hurkacz went 4-1 in singles during the tournament, capping a successful return from a seven-month injury layoff following knee surgery. In the 2024 final, he held two championship points before losing to Alexander Zverev, and last year he fell to Taylor Fritz in a third-set tiebreak. After two straight final losses, Poland captured its first United Cup title Sunday in Sydney, overcoming Iga Swiatek's loss to Belinda Bencic as Katarzyna Kawa and Jan Zielinski sealed the comeback in mixed doubles.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Did 12 months away from the ATP Tour give Thanasi Kokkinakis the time he needed to discover his musical side? I bought some DJ decks pretty early and played those for a month or two,” Kokkinakis told ATPTour.com this week in Adelaide, where he is continuing his comeback after recovering from surgery on his pectoral muscle. I get online, get on the headset, and when people talk some rubbish to me, I give a bit back! So that was one way of me trying to be competitive.” From Ugo Humbert's dabbling on the piano to Yannick Noah's pop career and Jannik Sinner's collaboration with renowned tenor Andrea Bocelli, there is plenty of crossover history between the ATP Tour and the world of music. For his part, Kokkinakis does not think he will be making a similar move anytime soon. “I learned the basic fundamentals, but then taking a step up, I didn't quite have the focus for it. On Monday, Kokkinakis will step on court at his hometown tournament, the Adelaide International, to compete in a tour-level singles match for the first time since his January 2025 Australian Open exit to Jack Draper. Last February, Kokkinakis underwent a radical surgery — rarely if ever carried out on a tennis player — after years of managing damaged tissue in his right pectoral muscle. As the ATP Tour moved on from Australia and carried on around the globe for the rest of the 2025 season, Kokkinakis stayed in Melbourne to embark on a rehab programme that did not guarantee any positive results. “Obviously it's different being home [in Adelaide], which is okay, but if you're in another place for longer, when you're used to only being there for one or max two weeks when you're on Tour, [it's hard]. “I tried to stay busy with a lot of things. I did some commentary, a lot of sponsor stuff, so I was trying to stay active and stay busy. That's a full-time job as much as anything, so I was just trying to get myself back to a point where I could even be in the draw for this tournament and give myself a chance.” While being unable to compete was naturally frustrating, Kokkinakis did not completely disengage with the goings-on in tennis across 2025. I wasn't shying away from it, but I wasn't following it closely all the time,” he said. “[I spoke to friends on Tour] a little bit. Mainly the Aussies, if they had a good result or something like that, I'd send them a message. Draper actually reached out as well, and obviously he's going through a little bit of a tricky period now as well. Kokkinakis is cautiously optimistic as he prepares for his comeback match against Korda, whom he was supposed to meet in the Adelaide quarter-finals a year ago before he withdrew due to his injury. Yet he is also realistic about the risk he chose with his surgery, in which he was given an Achille allograft to try to attach his pectoral muscle to his shoulder. “Just being back and getting to this point is not even something I was sure of,” said Kokkinakis, who made his competitive return in doubles last week at the Brisbane International presented by ANZ, alongside Nick Kyrgios. I've done everything training-wise to give myself a chance to be here and that in itself is a win. “Being able to go out on court knowing I've done a bunch of work and now I'm just praying my shoulder is alright, that definitely makes it worth it. Then the next step is going to be how I back up and where I go from here. Seeing some cameras again on me while I'm actually playing tennis is definitely an adjustment.” Your data will be used in accordance with the ATP Privacy Policy and WTA Privacy Policy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alejandro Davidovich Fokina is the top seed at the Adelaide International, where Tommy Paul, Stefanos Tsitsipas and hometown favourite Thanasi Kokkinakis also compete. 1) Can Foki thrive as a top seed? The 26-year-old Spaniard will look to bounce back from his opening-round exit in Brisbane when he takes on Tristan Schoolkate or Rinky Hijikata in his Adelaide opener. 2) Tsitsipas aims to stay perfect: The Greek former World No. Prior to Perth, the 12-time ATP Tour champion had not played a tour-level match since September due to a back injury, but he will step on court full of confidence for his Adelaide opener against a qualifier.

The American did not play after the US Open after rupturing a tendon in his left foot, but returned to action last week in Brisbane, where he fell to Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in a deciding-set tie-break. A two-time semi-finalist in Adelaide, this year's second seed will play Reilly Opelka or home hope Alexei Popyrin first. 4) Kokkinakis' comeback: Hometown favourite Kokkinakis will play his first singles match in 12 months when he steps on court to face Sebastian Korda in Adelaide. Having played doubles last week in Brisbane with Nick Kyrgios, Kokkinakis makes his singles return at the venue where he lifted his maiden ATP Tour trophy in 2022. 1 presented by PIF honours in 2025 has picked up where it left off this season. Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool reached the final in Brisbane to start their season, and the British duo will now head to Adelaide to compete as the top seeds. Their rivals in the draw include Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten. 1)	Shelton seeks fast start: As he has done for the three previous seasons, Shelton begins his season in Auckland. 8 in the PIF ATP Rankings, will be playing his first tour-level event since making his Nitto ATP Finals debut in November. Shelton's first opponent in New Zealand will be Francisco Comesana or Valentin Royer. 2) Ruud, Mensik compete: Ruud started his year with a statement victory against Top 10 star Alex de Minaur at the United Cup in Sydney, and the Norwegian will hope to reproduce that form as the second seed in Auckland. 3) Monfils begins his final season: The 39-year-old Gael Monfils has announced 2026 will be his last year as a pro tennis player, and the Frenchman will be keen to showcase his world-class talent whenever possible across the season. That mission begins in Auckland, where he lifted his 13th ATP Tour crown a year ago. The fifth seed opens his 2026 title bid against qualifier Hugo Gaston. 5) Bhambri/Goransson top seeds: Yuki Bhambri and Andre Goransson headline the doubles draw in Auckland.
